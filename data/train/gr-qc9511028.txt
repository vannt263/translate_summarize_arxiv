    "metric theories of gravity offer the singular beauty of endowing spacetime with a symmetric , second - rank tensor field @xmath1 that couples universally to all non - gravitational fields .",
    "this unique operational geometry is dependent upon the validity of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) , which states that the outcomes of nongravitational test experiments performed within a local , freely falling frame are independent of the frame s location ( local position invariance , lpi ) and velocity ( local lorentz invariance , lli ) in a background gravitational field .",
    "non metric theories break this universality by coupling additional gravitational fields to matter , and so violate either lpi , lli or both .",
    "limits on lpi or lli are imposed by gravitational redshift and atomic physics experiments respectively , by comparing atomic energy transitions that are sensitive to these symmetries .",
    "laser experiments have set stringent limits on violations of lli ( to a precision of @xmath2 ) @xcite , while the next generation of gravitational redshift experiments could reach a precision up to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these experiments probe transitions that are predominantly sensitive to nuclear electrostatic energy , although violations of wep / eep due to other forms of energy ( virtually all of which are associated with baryonic matter ) have also been estimated @xcite . however there",
    "exist many other physical systems , dominated by primarily non - baryonic energies , for which the validity of the eep is comparatively less well understood @xcite . included in the list of such systems",
    "are photons of differing polarization @xcite , antimatter systems @xcite , neutrinos @xcite , mesons @xcite , massive leptons , hypothesized dark matter , second and third generation matter , and quantum vacuum energies .    in order to establish the universal behavior of gravity , it is important to empirically confront the eep with as diverse a range of non - gravitational interactions as is possible . amongst the most intriguing of the list of physical systems noted above",
    "are those for which potential violations of the eep can arise in quantities dependent upon vacuum energy shifts , which are peculiarly quantum - mechanical in origin ( _ i.e. _ do not have a classical or semi - classical description ) .",
    "the empirical validity of the eep in physical systems where radiative corrections are non - negligible remains an open question .",
    "such systems provide an interesting empirical regime for a confrontation between gravitation and quantum mechanics .",
    "perhaps the most useful framework for further such testing of the eep is provided by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "we considered this approach in a previous paper @xcite by analyzing the behavior of lamb shift transition energies within the context of a wide class of nonmetric theories of gravity .",
    "the lamb shift , along with the anomalous magnetic moments ( @xmath0 factors ) of elementary particles , presents the most compelling evidence in support of qed .",
    "it is therefore natural to extend the nonmetric analysis to the @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "we consider in this paper the possibility of using measurements of anomalous magnetic moments of elementary particles as a possible test of the eep .",

    "similarly , we expect ( and shall subsequently demonstrate ) that such experiments could impose stringent and qualitatively new limits on the parameter space of nonmetric theories .",
    "our interpretation of those experiments is substantially different from theirs as we explicitly include violations of the eep in the computation of @xmath0 .",
    "these effects were not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which assumed that violations of special relativity arose only from the dynamical equation governing the motion of the fermion .",
    "we consider the class of non - metric theories described by the formalism @xcite , following the approach given in ref .",

    "this formalism encompasses a wide class of nonmetric theories of gravity , and deals with the dynamics of charged particles and electromagnetic fields in a static , spherically symmetric gravitational field .",
    "it assumes that the ( classical ) non - gravitational laws of physics can be derived from an action : @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the rest mass , charge , and world line of particle @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the metric is assumed to be [ tmumet ] ds^2 = t(r)dt^2 - h(r)(dr^2+r^2d^2 ) where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions of the ( background ) newtonian gravitational potential @xmath17 , which approaches unity as @xmath18 .",

    "i.e. _ the species of particle or field coupling to gravity . the functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 parameterize the ` photon metric ' , whereas @xmath13 and @xmath14 parameterize the ` particle metric ' in the static , spherically symmetric case .",
    "although we shall generically employ the notation @xmath13 and @xmath14 throughout this paper , it should be kept in mind that these functions shall in general have one set of values for electrons , another set for muons , another for protons , _",
    "etc._. universality of gravitational coupling in the particle sector implies that the @xmath13 and @xmath14 functions are species independent .",
    "it is an empirical question as to whether or not such universality holds for all particle species .",
    "the stringent limits on universality violation set by previous experiments @xcite have only been with regards to the relative gravitational couplings in the baryon / photon sector of the standard model . for the leptonic sector relevant to our considerations , relatively little is known @xcite .    in order to study atomic systems",

    "this action emerges upon replacing the point - particle part of the action in ( [ 1 ] ) with the dirac lagrangian , expanding the parameters about the origin , neglecting their spatial variation over atomic distance scales , and rescaling coordinates and fields .",
    "these operations have the effect of treating spatial and temporal derivatives and gauge couplings in the fermionic sector on the same footing , and so we need not add additional terms of the form @xmath22 times an arbitrary constant , as such terms can be re - absorbed into a definition of the parameters which appear in ( [ q1 ] ) above , as noted below .",
    "the action ( [ q1 ] ) refers to the preferred frame , as defined by the rest frame of the external gravitational field @xmath23 . in order to analyze effects in systems moving with velocity @xmath24 with respect to that frame",

    "the radiative corrections affecting these quantities are defined in terms of the photon self energy @xmath38 , fermion self energy @xmath39 , and vertex function @xmath40 respectively .",
    "these insertions involve the calculation of loop integrals as given by the feynman rules up to a given order .",
    "the addition of more parameters to the theory also entails new renormalizations beyond those of the wavefunctions , charge and mass of the fermion .",

    "where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , eep - violating corrections only appear in the electromagnetic sector of the action ( as terms proportional to @xmath31 ) .",
    "however a more general choice is @xmath45 , for which the particle sector of the lagrangian density is of the form _ d=(p - v - m)+_0(p_0-v_0)^0with @xmath46 . in the moving frame",

    "these one loop contributions can be summarized in terms of the feynman diagrams illustrated in fig . 1 .",
    "the feynman amplitudes for the diagrams follow from the feynman rules giving the result : [ ampli ] ^(p,p)=u(p)\\{^+p^+l^}u(p ) where [ vertex ] ^(p,p)&=&d^4k^ is_f(p-k)^is_f(p - k ) ^i g_(k ) + [ pola ] p^(p,p)&=&^i g_(q)i",

    "( [ vertex ] ) , ( [ pola ] ) , and ( [ leg ] ) as the vertex , polarization , and leg contributions , which respectively correspond to diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) plus ( d ) .",

    "the regularization of the photon propagator is carried out using [ regu ] -_^2^^2,-2_^2^^2 , with the assumed limits @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and the parameter renormalization by the inclusion of the corresponding counterterms to each loop integral .",

    "we just comment on the computation of the leg correction , which is ambiguous since it contains terms like @xmath54 , which are indeterminate . to obtain an unambiguous result , we must explicitly introduce a damping factor , which is necessary for the correct definition of the initial and final `` bare '' states .",

    "we will use the above results to compute the @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "to lowest order the feynman amplitude associated with the elastic scattering of an electron by a static external field is [ zero ] ieu(p)a(q)u(p ) .",
    "the radiative correction of order @xmath60 to this process is given by [ uno ] ieu(p)\\{(1+)_0a+^2_a}u(p ) where @xmath61 represents the ( known ) metric result and @xmath62 represents the contribution from ( [ final ] ) .    in the nonrelativistic limit of slowly moving particles ( @xmath63 ) and a static magnetic field , it is straightforward to show that ea(q ) & & -b + e_0a&&-()b + e_a&&ega [ xigg ] with @xmath56 given by ( [ gg ] ) , which is the dominant term as @xmath64 .    in order to simplify this contribution , we consider a constant magnetic field @xmath65 , that is @xmath66 , in which case qa-(buu -bu^2 ) where we have neglected the terms that mix the large and small spinor components .",

    "the previous result is the contribution of ( [ xigg ] ) to ( [ uno ] ) , which added to ( [ zero ] ) , give us the relevant part of the hamiltonian as [ inter ] h_=-\\{sb+_*subu } + o(^2)o(^2 ) -^ijs_ib_j with [ gs ] g&&\\{2 + } + [ gu ] _ * g_*&&-^2 where we have identified @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath71 parameters account for the coupling strength between the magnetic field and spin .",
    "we see that @xmath72 generalizes the gyromagnetic ratio of a fermion analogous to the manner in which the anomalous mass tensor generalizes the mass of a particle @xcite .",
    "we therefore identify the parameters @xmath73 with the components of the _ anomalous gyromagnetic ratio tensor _ of the fermion in the class of theories .",
    "note that the presence of preferred frame effects induces a qualitatively new form of interaction between the spin and magnetic field which is quantified by @xmath74 . here , instead of coupling with each other , they both couple independently to the fermion velocity relative to the preferred frame .",
    "this interaction stems purely from radiative corrections , and would be absent in any tree - level analysis of gmqed .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ inter ] ) describes the interaction ( as seen from the particle rest frame ) between the particle spin and an external homogeneous magnetic field . from this",
    "we can extract the energy difference between electrons with opposite spin projection in the direction of the magnetic field as : [ eshift ] e_=- where @xmath75 is the angle between the magnetic field and the preferred frame velocity .",
    "the influence of the radiative corrections ( coming from @xmath0 and @xmath76 ) in ( [ eshift ] ) is negligible in comparison to the dominant factor of 2 in @xmath77 .",
    "since we want to single out the effects of the non - metric corrections , it is more interesting to study the precession of the spin or , more specifically , the oscillation of the longitudinal spin polarization . in the metric case , this frequency is proportional to the factor @xmath0 , and so it is a distinctive signature of radiative corrections .",
    "the observable quantity in the @xmath0 experiments is actually the electron polarization , which is proportional to the quantum mechanical expectation value of @xmath78 , that is , @xmath79 . using ehrenfest s theorem , a quantum mechanical solution for the motion of @xmath79",

    "note that the preferred frame effect will show distinctly as a temporal variation of the spin component parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "in general we want to know the spin precession relative to some specific laboratory system , with respect to which the particle is moving with some velocity @xmath81 .",
    "this frame need not _ a - priori _ be the previously defined preferred frame , and so @xmath82 .",
    "since the formalism does not change ( locally ) the fermion electromagnetic field interaction , we expect that a charged particle in the presence of an homogeneous magnetic field will satisfy the equation [ spin2 ] = _ c with the cyclotron frequency @xmath83 and @xmath84 . relating ( [ spin1 ] ) to the laboratory system yields [ spin3 ] |_lab=|_r.f .",

    "this frequency is kinematic in origin and it is a consequence of the non - commutativity of the lorentz transformations .    relating the primed variables in ( [ spin1 ] ) to the laboratory ones by a lorentz transformation gives [ spin5 ] |_lab = s_s with _ s = b+(1-)_c+ _ * ( bu)u where we have set @xmath86 and considered ( for simplicity ) the case of orbital motion perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath87 ) in the above .",
    "note that the spin precession about @xmath88 is no longer parallel to the magnetic field ( axial direction ) , but has a component parallel to @xmath24 that comes from radiative and nonmetric effects .    at this point",
    "it becomes necessary to define the preferred coordinate system .",
    "there are several candidates ( such as the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background ) for this frame @xcite .",
    "to study this issue it is sufficient to assume that the laboratory system ( earth ) moves with a non - relativistic velocity ( @xmath89 ) with respect to the preferred frame , and so we can identify @xmath90    in order to single out the effects of radiative corrections , we study the spin precession relative to the rotational motion of the electron , that is : [ set1 ] |_rot = s_d with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where the first two components are perpendicular to @xmath65 ( lower index ) but parallel and perpendicular to @xmath81 ( upper index ) , and the last one parallel to @xmath65 . in the following we refer to the difference frequency ( @xmath93 ) as the anomalous frequency ( given its connection with the anomalous magnetic moment in the metric case ) .",

    "in @xmath98 we group all the terms parallel to the magnetic field that contribute to the anomalous frequency ( including nonmetric effects ) .",
    "the remaining terms perpendicular to @xmath97 arise from nonmetric effects only , and produce a temporal variation of the spin component parallel to the magnetic field .",

    "the measured redshift parameter related to this frequency may be written as z = u(1-),=^ij where @xmath127 will depend upon the specific frequency measured in the experiments .",
    "note that this tensor is equivalent to the anomalous passive gravitational mass tensor introduced for the study of atomic transitions .    in @xmath0 experiments the relevant frequency is @xmath98 , which describes the precession of the longitudinal polarization in the presence of a constant magnetic field .",

    "it is useful to redefine the gravitational potential @xmath23 by [ u ] u - g_0x whose gradient yields the test - body acceleration @xmath149 .",

    "note that this depends on the anomalous frequency related to the longitudinal polarization of the beam .",
    "it is also species - dependent , with the value of @xmath150 and @xmath61 for the electron differing from that of the muon .",
    "a search for possible position dependence of anomalous spin precession frequencies provides another qualitatively new test of lpi sensitive to radiative corrections .",
    "actually the most precise @xmath0 experiments for electron measure the ratio @xmath151 at non relativistic electron energies ( @xmath152 ) , and so @xmath153 .",

    "this result is sensitive to the absolute value of the total local gravitational potential @xcite , whose magnitude has recently been estimated to be as large as @xmath156 due to the local supercluster @xcite .",
    "hence measurements of this type can provide us with empirical information sensitive to radiative corrections that constrains the allowed regions of @xmath157 parameter space , giving in this case : |_0+_0|<10",
    "^ -3 for muons the analogous constraint is @xmath158 , and so nothing conclusive is obtained .",
    "we pause to compare this result to an analogous result obtained for hyperfine transitions ( maser clocks ) . in this case",
    "the baryonic and leptonic gravitational parameters appear simultaneously .",
    "the atomic hyperfine splitting comes from the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and proton ( nucleus ) .",
    "the proton metric appears only in the latter , and so it does not affect the principal and fine structure atomic energy levels .",
    "non - metric effects imply a shift in the hyperfine energy @xmath159 which is @xcite [ hf1 ] e_hf = e_hf(1-u_b)+e_hf u_b^hf with ^hf=3_b-_b+where @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the baryonic analogues of the parameters appearing in ( [ gamlam ] ) . in ( [ hf1 ] ) we rescaled the atomic parameters to absorb the functions and chose units such that @xmath163 .",
    "the quantity @xmath164 is given by = 2and would vanish under the assumption that the leptonic and baryonic parameters were the same .",
    "the gravity probe a experiment @xcite , employing hydrogen - maser clocks , was able to constrain the corresponding lpi violating parameter related to hyperfine transitions , obtaining @xmath165 for the most stringent bound to date on @xmath166 .",
    "we note that a similar analysis could be carried out for the energy shift defined in ( [ eshift ] ) , which can be used as a frequency test to look for position or frame dependence .",
    "this can be done by following the same procedure as for atomic energy shifts , where the anomalous passive and inertial gravitational tensor are introduced in order to relate non - metric effects to redshift and time dilation parameters .",
    "since radiative corrections are irrelevant in that energy shift , we omit that procedure here .",
    "refined measurements of anomalous magnetic moments can provide an interesting new arena for investigating the validity of the eep in physical systems where radiative corrections are important .",
    "we have considered this possibility explicitly for the class of non - metric theories described by the formalism .",
    "the non - universal character of the gravitational couplings in such theories affects the one loop corrections to the scattering amplitude of a free fermion in an external electromagnetic field in a rather complicated way , giving rise to several novel effects .",
    "an evaluation of the one - loop diagrams reveals that the leg corrections , which in the metric case give no contribution to the total amplitude after a proper renormalization of mass and spinor field , provide contributions which can not be removed after renormalization .",
    "moreover they are essential in ensuring the gauge invariance of the scattering amplitude , which is not fulfilled by the vertex correction alone .",
    "the consistency of the calculation is verified explicitly through the ward identity , which furnishes a cross - check between the fermion self energy and the vertex correction .",
    "the non metric corrections to the scattering amplitude also have an infrared divergence , which could be understood in terms of inelastic soft photon radiation , as in the metric case .",
    "this does not affect the term associated with the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the presence of preferred frame effects induces a new type of coupling between the magnetic field and the spin as described by ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "this interaction stems purely from radiative corrections , and generalizes the gyromagnetic ratio of a fermion to a tensorial coupling described by @xmath72 .",
    "we emphasize that qualitatively new information on the validity of the eep will be obtained by setting new empirical bounds on this coupling , as it is associated with purely _ leptonic _ matter .",
    "comparatively little is known about such empirical limits on eep - violation relative to the baryonic sector @xcite , for which previous experiments have set the limit @xcite @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the ratio of the limiting speed of baryonic matter to the speed of light .",
    "we can therefore safely neglect any putative effects of @xmath169 in our analysis .",
    "consequently , discussion of a @xmath0 contribution to the magnetic moment no longer makes sense , and we instead refer to the anomalous frequency as the main connection with experiment . note that this frequency , defined as the relative electron spin precession with respect to its velocity , comes from radiative corrections and it becomes proportional to @xmath0 in the metric case",
    "this frequency shows an explicit dependence on both the preferred frame velocity and its relative direction with respect to the external magnetic field .",
    "there is also a dependence on the electron velocity , which makes the other contributions negligible at relativistic electron energies .",
    "two @xmath0 experiments on the electron ( one at relativistic energies and the other almost at rest ) may then be used to limit the preferred frame parameter to be no larger than @xmath170 , analogous to the work of newman _",
    "et al._. constraining any possible eep violation to be no larger than the present discrepancy between theory and experiment we found the most stringent bounds for @xmath31 yet obtained for leptonic matter , as given in ( [ belectron ] ) and ( [ bmuon ] ) .",
    "we expect that new experiments which probe the anisotropic character ( or angular dependence ) of the frequency could be used to impose stronger limits in different physical regimes .",
    "for example , as the earth rotates , the spatial orientation of the magnetic field changes  this should in turn diminish the experimental errors involved in the comparison between two energetically different @xmath0 experiments .",
    "the relativistic generalization of the spin polarization equation ( [ spin5 ] ) , followed the same procedure as for the metric case , where non - metric effects where included in the interaction only ( eq .",
    "( [ inter ] ) ) .",
    "this yields an equation of motion for the spin ( as seen from the rest frame ) which is qualitatively different from that expected from its classical counterpart , where the angular momentum rate is related to the torque applied on the system .",
    "this approach for dealing with violations of lorentz invariance is dynamical ; from a kinematical viewpoint we assume that standard lorentz transformations relate coordinates and fields from one system to another .",
    "perhaps the most remarkable feature of the non - metric effects is that of the oscillations of the component of spin polarization parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "since this component remains constant in the metric case , an experiment which searches for such oscillations is a new null test of the equivalence principle that is uniquely sensitive to radiative corrections in the leptonic sector .",
    "hence an empirical investigation of its behavior will provide qualitatively new information about the validity of eep , and could constrain even further the limits on the preferred frame parameters .",
    "finally , we analyzed the behavior of the anomalous frequency in the context of redshift experiments , which can put constraints on the lpi - violating parameters ( @xmath150 , @xmath61 ) once the corresponding experiments are carried out .",
    "this region of parameter space is qualitatively different from that probed by either lamb - shift or hyperfine effects . in the electron sector",
    "a bound on the magnitude of @xmath171 can be obtained by demanding that it be no larger than the error bounds in the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical values of the ratio @xmath151 . assuming the local potential to be as large as that estimated from the local supercluster",
    ", we obtain a bound on @xmath172 that is comparable the limit on an analogous quantity in the baryonic sector obtained from redshift experiments @xcite .",
    "however this latter experiment is proportional to changes in the local potential , which are @xmath173 .",
    "more direct limits on @xmath172 must be set by performing a similar sort of redshift experiment on anomalous magnetic moments @xcite .",
    "the logistics and higher precision demanded by such an experiment will be a major challenge to undertake .",
    "this work was supported in part by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "we show the main steps leading to eqs .",
    "( [ vertex - f ] ) , ( [ self - f ] ) , and ( [ pola - f ] ) .",
    "details are given throughout the computation by considering only the first term of the photon propagator ( [ fp ] ) , that is [ fp1 ] g_^=+with the remaining term in ( [ fp ] ) contributing in a similar manner .",
    "we solve for the fermion self energy by replacing ( [ fp1 ] ) in ( [ self ] ) , and using ( [ regu ] ) along with the feynman parameters",

    "choosing the counterterms so that @xmath180 and so m&=&-m(-()^2 ) + [ xi0]_0&=&(+()^2 ) the regularized result is then ( p)&=&(p - m)\\{-^2 } + & + & o((p - m)^2 ) . note that the remaining ultraviolet divergence related to this term could be removed after charge renormalization .",
    "we find it convenient to leave it in order to cross - check the calculation , since a similar term from the vertex part should cancel it , thereby removing the divergence from the resulting scattering amplitude .",
    "the evaluation of the vertex function follows a similar procedure , giving the result [ vertex - a ] ^&=&\\{^ + & -&x(p^+p^ ) -(p^+p^)(1-x ) + & + & ( p_xp_x^- ^p_x^2 ( - ) -(1-x)p p^-x p p^ ) + & + & p_x(^(p + p)-p_x^ ) } + with @xmath181 .",
    "since ( [ vertex - a ] ) is acting on a free spinor , we can use @xmath182 with @xmath183 , and so expand @xmath184 which after some algebra reduces ( [ vertex - a ] ) to ^(p,p)&=&\\{^ + & + & ^(+ ) + ^-^ + & -&^+^+ ^-(+ ) + & -&}+o(q^3)where the vertex function has been renormalized by subtracting a term like ^=_0^with @xmath185 is given by ( [ xi0 ] ) .",
    "we recall that gauge invariance forces this coefficient to be equal to the one participating in the renormalization of the fermion self energy .",
    "in order to describe how self energy effects convert the incident electron from a bare particle to a physical one , it is convenient to introduce a damping function , @xmath186 , which adiabatically switches off the coupling between fields , such that the interaction lagrangian is replaced by _",
    "i = eg(t)(x)a(x)(x ) it is assumed that the time @xmath13 over which @xmath186 varies is very long compared to the duration of the scattering process . in momentum space g(t)=g(_0)(ix)d_0 with @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",
    "it is supposed that @xmath189 is almost a delta function , being large for @xmath190 in a range of about @xmath191      as @xmath194 , and @xmath195 , @xmath196 , the fermion propagator reduces to s_f=- where we used @xmath197 .",
    "this implies that we can expand @xmath198 up to order @xmath199 only , since higher terms vanish after taking the previous limit .",
    "here we employ the relation = + b+to expand [ sig1 ] ( p-)(p)-^. after renormalization , @xmath198 takes the form [ sig2 ] ( p)=(p - m)(a+b(p)^2)+c(p)\\ { ( p - m)+(p - m)}+where the constants @xmath200 , @xmath97 , and @xmath201 can be obtained from eq .",
