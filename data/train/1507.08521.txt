    "highly porous metallic foams possess an extensive application potential .",
    "these materials feature high energy absorption , strength , and stiffness at very low weight , which makes them appealing for the automotive , aircraft , and defense industry , to name a few  @xcite . in order to foster new application areas , a qualified understanding of the foam behavior and relevant predictive tools",
    "are required .",
    "computer models , in particular , are regarded as a key ingredient to optimization of either / both the microstructure geometry or / and final products made of these materials  @xcite . a consensus regarding",
    "the approximation of the behavior of porous solids seems to exist .",
    "open - cell foams are usually represented with the three - dimensional beam models , while their closed - cell counterparts require an addition of membrane elements acting as the cell walls  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of very thin walls even the behavior of closed - cell foams can be approximated with beams  @xcite . following this assumption ,",
    "ashby and gibson presented a three - dimensional beam model of the unit cell and derived solutions to the overall thermo - mechanical parameters based purely on material porosity  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to explore the adequacy of a two - dimensional wired model discretized with beam elements .",
    "we build on the recent outcomes by nmeek  et  al .",
    "@xcite , who developed a planar beam model based on the approximation of foam ligament geometry by the voronoi tessellation .",
    "the objectives of the paper are threefold :    a.   to investigate the influence of real geometry of foam ligaments and the proper size of computational models  @xcite ; b.   to provide the upper and lower bounds on the effective stiffness coefficients for the two - dimensional beam model via the first - order homogenization procedure ; c.   to validate obtained results against the experimental and numerical results from  @xcite and to question the assumption of the vanishing poisson ratio made therein .",
    "the first objective is addressed with the help of wang tilings , a concept recently introduced to materials engineering community  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the foam microstructure is compressed within a set of smaller domains , called wang tiles .",
    "the morphology of the tiles is designed such that the tiles are microstructurally compatible across the corresponding edges . as a result",
    "the reconstructed material microstructure remains continuous across the gridline of the regular lattice to which the tiles are accommodated during synthesis of a computational model , see  fig .  [",
    "fig : tileillustration](c ) .",
    "the method is extremely efficient in producing arbitrarily diverse ensembles of arbitrarily sized and geometrically consistent microstructure realizations in a fully stochastic setting  @xcite .",
    "moreover , creating the finite element mesh on the level of tiles avoids expensive mesh generation of each microstructure realization .",
    "altogether , we are able to reach for a proper size of the computational model , which is expected to be relatively large because of the infinite contrast in constituent properties  @xcite .    as regards the second objective , we reformulate the first - order homogenization procedure for the wire - frame finite element models by means of macroscopic degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "the upper bound on the apparent stiffness is obtained from the ensemble of microstructures exposed to the kinematic uniform boundary conditions ( kubc ) .",
    "the lower bound is rendered by applying the minimal kinematic boundary conditions ( mkbc )  @xcite . in order to compare our results with those reported in  @xcite , the bulk and shear moduli",
    "are derived from the homogenized stiffness matrices by assuming material isotropy .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in the next chapter alporas^^ aluminum foam , the material of interest ,",
    "is characterized in brief .",
    "section [ sec : strategy ] covers the adopted modeling strategy addressing the first objective .",
    "in particular , wang tilings are presented first together with their use in the context of numerical homogenization .",
    "description of microstructure discretization into planar beams is also provided in this section .",
    "the first order homogenization is reviewed in  section  [ sec : homogenization ] with emphasis on the beam model and the boundary conditions connected to the upper and lower bounds on the effective stiffness .",
    "numerical results are provided in  section  [ sec : results ] and discussed in the last section .",
    "we use the following nomenclature within the text .",
    "scalar quantities are denoted by plain letters , e.g. @xmath0 or @xmath1 , matrices by bold sans - serif font , e.g. @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and tensorial quantities by bold serif letters , e.g. @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , we adopt the standard voigt matrix representation of symmetric second- and fourth - order tensors .",
    "alporas^^ is the closed - cell aluminum foam commercially produced by shinko wire company ,  ltd .",
    "@xcite with porosity between 90  % and 92  %  @xcite .",
    "the pore space is composed of approximately polyhedral voids with the mean size of around 3  mm .",
    "the main field of its application lies in the energy absorption structures .",
    "predominantly , alporas^^ is used in production of self - supporting sound absorbers  @xcite .",
    "the sandwich plates comprising of alporas^^ foam core were also reported to outperform common steel plates under blast loading in e.g.  @xcite .",
    "regarding the linear elastic behavior , the design guide to metallic foams  @xcite suggests the overall parameters enlisted in tab .",
    "[ tab : alporasproperties ] .",
    ".properties of alporas^^ foam @xcite .",
    "here @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for the bulk , shear and young moduli , respectively , and @xmath9 is the poisson ratio . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      and @xmath7 . ]    since we failed to predict the reported stiffness parameters of alporas^^ foam , tab .",
    "[ tab : alporasproperties ] , with the cross - sectional characteristics derived for tiling - based geometries , we performed the same computations also for cross - sectional parameters derived for the real - geometry mesh , tab .",
    "[ tab : foamsections ] .",
    "the results , in brackets in tab .  [ tab : foamresults ] , were approximately @xmath10 higher reflecting nearly linearly the @xmath11 increase in the second moment of area .",
    "however , they do not fall within the reported range of overall alporas^^ properties either .",
    "we presented a modeling strategy for alporas^^ foam having at heart the synthesis of stochastic microstructure realizations based on the concept of wang tiling .",
    "besides the standard upper bounds on the effective stiffness given by kinematic uniform boundary conditions , we obtained the guaranteed lower bounds by means of minimal kinematic boundary conditions . with this formulation , shown to equal the common static uniform boundary conditions in  @xcite",
    ", we can avoid the question of an appropriate beam loading that would yield macroscopically uniform stress field .",
    "hence , both bounds were rendered prescribing relevant boundary displacement .    based on data in fig .  [ fig : results ] , we conclude that rve for the two - dimensional model of highly porous materials should be about hundreds of the characteristic pore diameter length in dimensions .",
    "this finding corresponds with statements made in  @xcite regarding the minimal size of rve in the case of infinite contrast of phase properties . on the other hand",
    ", it contradicts the recommendation of ashby  et  al .",
    "@xcite who propose rve size of approximately seven times the mean pore diameter .",
    "however , this recommendation is given for three - dimensional samples and does not need to be valid for planar analyses .",
    "comparison of the homogenized stiffness coefficients with the reference values reported by ashby  et  al .",
    "@xcite , tabs .",
    "[ tab : alporasproperties ] and [ tab : foamresults ] , leads us to unambiguous conclusions . despite the several times reported aptness of the _ spatial _ wired model @xcite",
    ", it can be conjectured that the adopted _ planar _ beam representation has a limited capability in predicting the complex behavior of alporas^^ foam .",
    "possibly , it lacks the stiffness contribution from the out - of - plane beams and membranes as well as the cell walls parallel to the investigated plane , though , the membrane contribution of cell walls was reported negligible in the case of high - porosity foams  @xcite .",
    "the qualitative analysis of the impact of the geometry representation clearly shows that the voronoi mesh adopted in  @xcite leads to the overestimated value of bulk modulus .",
    "assuming only the volumetric deformation , the axial stiffness of straight beams dominates the behavior of the voronoi model resulting in nearly incompressible behavior , whilst in the case of real - geometry and tiling - based meshes the axial and bending stiffness contribute equally .",
    "this explains the results reported in  @xcite where the authors considered only the volumetric excitation . on top of that , based on their experimental observations , they assumed negligible poisson s effect and equated young s modulus to the oedometric component of the homogenized stiffness matrix .",
    "however , if the homogenization procedure was performed carefully , they would arrive at similar results as in tab .",
    "[ tab : foamresults ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that zero poisson s ratio is in contradiction also with the characteristics listed in  tab .",
    "[ tab : alporasproperties ] , see  @xcite for further details .    despite the incapability of the two - dimensional beam model to capture behavior of complex materials such as highly porous metallic foams , the concept of wang tilings proved to be a valuable technique to generate large computational domains of desired geometrical characteristics .",
    "moreover , it allows to circumvent meshing of every single microstructure realization if the dicretization mesh is constructed on each tile separately such that it satisfies the given compatibility constrains .",
    "there is a promising possibility to extend the presented modeling strategy to three dimensions via wang cubes , a spatial variant of wang tiles , along with the spatial voronoi tessellation to compress the true geometry of alporas^^ foam , and to perform a similar analysis using shell elements instead of prismatic beams .",
