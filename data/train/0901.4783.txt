    "as is apparent from its complex x - ray morphology , macsj0717.5 + 3745 is far from virialized , and the gas temperature can be expected to vary significantly in its core . in order to derive a spatial temperature map , we need to define suitable regions for x - ray spectroscopy , the redshift of the cluster set to z@xmath3 @xcite , and abundance z @xmath4 . ] .",

    "the latter , however , is _ a priori _ unknown , and the limited photon statistics of our data do not allow us to extract spectra in arbitrarily small bins .",

    "note that two of the initial regions were excluded from the rebinning and left unchanged , namely the ones coinciding with the main peaks in the x - ray surface brightness distribution , a22 ( b9 ) and a33 ( b12 ) . both of these exhibit markedly cooler temperatures than their surroundings , making them likely candidates for cool cores of clusters still in the process of merging with the main system .",
    "this interpretation is particularly plausible for the region around the global peak in the x - ray emission from macsj0717.5 + 3745 , a33 ( b12 ) , which is found to contain the coolest gas anywhere within our study region ( k@xmath19 kev ) . by comparison ,",
    "the temperature measured for the second putative cool core , region a22 ( b9 ) , is much higher and less well constrained ( k@xmath20 kev ) , but still in stark contrast to the much higher temperatures above 15 kev measured in its immediate vicinity ( regions a1 , a5 , and a7 ) . with all of these regions being viewed in projection ,",
    "the true temperature difference is likely to be yet higher .",
    "better constraints from a two - phase plasma model , especially relevant for region b9 , would require significantly better photon statistics .    although the selection of regions to merge is to some degree subjective , we convinced ourselves that our final results and conclusions are robust .",
    "for instance , our perhaps most debatable choice , the exclusion of the aforementioned cool core a22 ( b9 ) from the merging of the surrounding regions a1 , a5 , and a7 ( b1 ) , predictably increases the temperature measured for b1 ( k@xmath21 kev ) ; including it , however , still leads to a statistically consistent result of k@xmath22 kev ( fig .

    "a comparison of the gas and galaxy distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fighst ] as well as of the radial velocity information summarized in table  [ tablevel ] yields important insights into the dynamics of the multiple components of the cluster core .",
    "specifically , we note that , of the four galaxy concentrations discussed in section  [ galprop ] , only a and c are reasonably well aligned with peaks in the x - ray surface brightness . the good x - ray / optical alignment of component c , combined with a systemic velocity and velocity dispersion consistent with those of macsj0717.5 + 3745 as a whole",
    ", makes this subsystem a likely candidate for the actual , if disturbed , core of the main cluster .",
    "the dominant galaxies in regions b and d , on the other hand , are offset by about 25 arcsec ( @xmath31160 kpc at the cluster redshift ) from the respective x - ray peak  in both cases in a direction that points toward the filament to the se of the main cluster .",
    "offsets of this kind between gas and galaxies ( and dark matter ) have been observed before in merging clusters , examples being the bullet cluster 1es065756 @xcite and macsj0025.41222 @xcite , and are readily explained by the difference in the self - interaction cross sections of the various cluster constituents .",
    "the x - ray temperature maps of fig .",
    "[ figxtemp1 ] show the gas near regions b and d being cool compared to their surroundings ( b9 and b12 ) ; we can thus safely identify them as the cool cores of clusters merging with the main body of macsj0717.5 + 3745 and falling behind as their respective galaxy populations advance . while the merger axis of system d is consistent with lying in the plane of the sky ( and aligned with the large - scale filament prominently visible on the left of fig .",
    "[ xrayim ] ) , the combination of the observed x - ray / optical offset with a very high radial velocity indicates that system b is moving through the cluster core along an axis that is much more inclined toward our line of sight .",
    "we note also that the high - velocity collision of component b most likely happened only recently , given that its cool core ( region b12 in fig .",
    "[ figxtemp1 ] ) appears to be still largely intact .",
    "a similar argument can be made to explain the observational evidence in region a. the x - ray / optical offset suggests infall from the nw , i.e.  in the direction of the filament .",
    "the trailing peak in the gas density is highly elongated though , and no cool gas is detected in the area , all of which suggests that we are witnessing back - infall of a cluster that originated from the filament and has already passed through the main cluster once .    while the combined x - ray / optical evidence allows a straightforward and self - consistent interpretation of the dynamics and three - dimensional geometry of the three seperate ongoing merger events described above , the gas distribution and temperature structure near the cluster - filament interface  the south - eastern corner of figs .",
    "[ figxtemp1 ] and [ fighst ]  defies simple explanation .",
    "although the extremely high temperatures measured in regions b1 and b2 could to some extent be caused by shock heating from the ongoing mergers of components b and d , this explanation appears implausible for the entirety of the hot interface region extending from b3 to b4 .",
    "the sheer size of this feature ( about 1 mpc ) , its alignment perpendicular to the cluster - filament axis , and the simultaneous increase in gas temperature and x - ray surface brightness all point to a direct large - scale interaction between the filament and the cluster core .",
    "we therefore speculate that the prominent jump in gas density and temperature along the cluster - filament interface is the result of contiguous accretion of gas along the large - scale filament feeding macsj0717.5 + 3745 .",
    "a deeper chandra observation would allow this hypothesis to be tested and may yield the first credible characterization of the gas content of large - scale filaments .",
