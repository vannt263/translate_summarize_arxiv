    "there are relatively few exact solutions of alternative theories of gravity , although many such theories are currently studied with various motivations ranging from the possibility of using them to explain the current acceleration of the universe without dark energy , or for their properties in the early universe , as low - energy effective theories for quantum gravity , as emergent gravity theories , or just as toy models to understand which properties are , or are not , desirable in a theory of gravity ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "when getting to know a theory of gravity , it is important to understand its spherically symmetric solutions and especially its black holes .",

    "an early classification of spherical solutions of brans - dicke theory was given by brans @xcite .",
    "a common tool used in scalar - tensor and other theories of gravity is that of conformal transformations , which relate the physics in one conformal representation of the theory ( `` jordan frame '' ) to another ( `` einstein frame '' ) .",

    "e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) and recently the `` veiled schwarzschild spacetime '' has been used as an example for discussions of conformal frames @xcite . among the known spherically symmetric and static solutions of brans - dicke theory are the campanelli - lousto spacetimes @xcite , which are usually reported as black holes or `` cold black holes '' ( because they have zero surface gravity and temperature @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that the veiled schwarzschild spacetime is a special case of the campanelli - lousto metrics corresponding to certain fixed values of the parameters .",
    "given the widespread use of conformal transformations in gravity and in cosmology , one would like to understand better the veiled schwarzschild metric and the more general campanelli - lousto class to which it belongs , as well as veiled black holes in other theories of gravity .",
    "extra motivation is provided by the finding that generalized brans - dicke solutions describe asymptotically lifschitz black holes in the jordan ( but not in the einstein ) frame @xcite .    in this paper",

    "let us study how the area of 2-spheres of symmetry behaves as @xmath16 varies .",
    "we have = and the areal radius ( and consequently the area @xmath17 of 2-spheres which are orbits of the isometry ) decreases for @xmath18 , has a minimum r_minr ( r_min)= ( 2+a ) a^-a/2 at @xmath19 , and increases for @xmath20 ( fig .  [ figa ] ) . by using the relation between differentials dr= dr",
    ", it is straightforward to rewrite the campanelli - lousto line element ( [ cllineelement ] ) as ds^2=-v^b+1(r ) dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 d_(2)^2 .",
    "the apparent ( or trapping ) horizons of a spherically symmetric spacetime are located by the equation @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "because of the exponent  2 in the denominator of the coefficient of @xmath24 , however , @xmath25 does not change sign at its zero @xmath23 but has a double root there ( see fig .",

    "therefore , the apparent horizon at @xmath19 is not a black hole , but rather a wormhole apparent horizon .",

    "this solution , rediscovered by various authors @xcite , is the most general static and spherically symmetric solution of the einstein equations with zero cosmological constant and a massless scalar field @xcite .",

    "it had to be so because , _ in vacuo _ , the jebsen - birkhoff theorem requires that the only static spherically symmetric solution of @xmath49 with zero cosmological constant be the schwarzschild solution .",

    "in a recent paper , deruelle and sasaki discuss conformal transformations between different conformal frames , having in mind the jordan frame and the einstein frame used in scalar - tensor and @xmath56 gravity , and argue the physical equivalence of these conformal frames .",
    "this paper should be placed in the context of an ongoing debate on the physical equivalence of conformal frames ( especially in scalar - tensor gravity ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein and in @xcite ) .",
    "deruelle and sasaki use as an example the `` veiled '' schwarzschild black hole , _ i.e. _ , they take the schwarzschild line element of gr [ schwarzschild ] ds^2=-(1- ) dt^2 + + r^2d_(2)^2 as the jordan frame metric and perform a conformal transformation to the einstein frame metric @xmath57 with conformal factor @xmath58 .",

    "when developing a theory of gravity , it must be said how ordinary matter couples to gravity . in the jordan frame matter",
    "is minimally coupled to the spacetime metric , the einstein equivalence principle holds , and units are fixed . in the einstein frame ,",
    "in which the gravitational part of the action assumes the einstein - hilbert form , matter is coupled to both the metric and the conformal factor @xmath61 ( or the scalar field @xmath48 ) and the units are no longer fixed ( this property is true not only in the einstein frame , but in all the `` veiled '' frames conformally related to the jordan frame ) . the familiar results which follow from the einstein equivalence principle",
    "do not hold in the `` veiled '' frames and either the notion of varying units or that of variable masses and couplings has to be introduced , expressing the fact that a minimally coupled theory has become a non - minimally coupled one . then",
    ", a conformal transformation does not change the physics .",
    "however , one must be careful in using the einstein frame description since misunderstandings can occur , as explained below .",
    "the veiled schwarzschild metric is nothing but a special case of the campanelli - lousto solutions  ( [ cllineelement ] ) of brans - dicke theory corresponding to the parameter values @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . according to the discussion of the previous section ,",
    "this identification gives the areal radius r(r)=. this function decreases between @xmath64 , assumes the minimum value @xmath65 , and then increases for @xmath66 . as explained above for the general campanelli - lousto class of solutions , the metric  ( [ veiled ] ) , taken at face value , describes a wormhole , not a black hole .",
    "however , @xcite also notes that the quantity which is important to locate when considering conformal transformations is not the apparent horizon ( which , contrary to event horizons , changes location under a change of conformal frame ) .",
    "instead , it is a new surface , characterized in @xcite in terms of an entropy 2-form , which is to be considered in place of the apparent horizon when conformal transformations are involved .",
    "indeed , it is noted in @xcite that there are no true trapping horizons ( at @xmath67 or elsewhere ) in the veiled schwarzschild metric ( [ veiled ] ) and that the expansions of both ingoing and outgoing radial null geodesic congruences vanish at @xmath67 . when the correct horizon defined through an entropy 2-form is taken into account , the metric ( [ veiled ] ) is interpreted again as a black hole , not as a wormhole @xcite .",
    "this fact becomes more intuitive if one thinks that the apparent horizon is the place where the cross - sectional area @xmath68 of a bundle of null rays becomes stationary and that , when the units of length are scaling in the einstein frame , the units of area scale as @xmath69 and one must consider not @xmath68 but the ratio of this quantity to its unit , @xmath70 .",
    "the ratio of the einstein frame areal radius to its unit is @xmath71 , which is trivially monotonic and does not describe a wormhole throat .",
    "the area of the black hole horizon expressed in varying units of area is = 4r_h^2 ( 1- ) = 4r_h^2=16m^2 , where @xmath72 .",
    "what should we make of all this ?",
    "if one forgets that the metric ( [ veiled ] ) is obtained from the schwarzschild one by means of a conformal transformation , one will naturally consider the apparent horizons of this spacetime instead of the new surface introduced in @xcite to characterize its nature .",
    "that is , one will correctly interpret the metric ( [ veiled ] ) as a campanelli - lousto solution of brans - dicke theory representing a wormhole .",
    "however , if the metric ( [ veiled ] ) is instead seen as a conformally transformed schwarzschild metric , which represents a genuine black hole ( the prototypical one ! ) and one is aware that the apparent horizon of this metric is not the relevant quantity , but the relevant substitute of this concept is to be located using the prescription in @xcite which is conformally invariant , then  ( [ veiled ] ) takes on a new meaning and is interpreted as a black hole instead of a wormhole . note",
    "that both interpretations are correct _ given the context to which they refer _ , and that this context is very different in the two situations .",
    "if one does not know that ( [ veiled ] ) comes from the conformal transformation of the schwarzschild black hole outer region , the only admissible interpretation of ( [ veiled ] ) is a wormhole spacetime .",
    "_ vice - versa _",
    ", if it is required that ( [ veiled ] ) is an einstein frame metric arising from the conformal transformation of the schwarzschild black hole , the interpretation is quite different : units are scaling in this frame , and the correct quantity to consider is not the surface where the expansions of null radial geodesic congruences vanish , but the surface introduced in @xcite .    to summarize , assigning a metric does not tell the whole story about a spacetime : if the metric arises from a conformal transformation of another metric , solution of a certain theory of gravity , this piece of information should be specified as an essential ingredient of the model because it determines the choice of quantities to be studied ( _ e.g. _ , here , the apparent horizon versus the redefined horizon of @xcite ) , the whole context in which to study the metric and , consequently , the physical interpretation of that spacetime metric",
    ". this amounts to specifying that ordinary matter is non - minimally coupled to gravity in the einstein frame .",
    "one way to determine the mass of a black hole or spherical body operationally is by studying the deflection of light in the corresponding spacetime , a technique widely used to map the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and clusters .",
    "the famous einstein formula for the deflection angle of a light ray grazing the surface of a spherical body of mass @xmath73 and radius @xmath38 is @xmath74 and is obtained in the weak - field approximation of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "this deflection angle should also be obtained in the veiled schwarzschild spacetime . _",
    "a priori _ this is obvious because null geodesics are conformally invariant but , without this piece of information , it is not immediately clear that this is the case just by looking at the metric  ( [ veiled ] ) .",
    "appendix  a shows how the calculation of the deflection angle and the empirical determination of the lens mass give the same result in the schwarzschild and the veiled schwarzschild spacetimes .",
    "the notion of veiled black hole may be generalized and , in order to have again a solution of the system one is dealing with , we consider a conformally invariant theory of gravity .",
    "thus , first we revisit weyl gravity , namely a conformally invariant quadratic gravity theory and its black hole solution found by riegert and discussed by others @xcite .",

    "when the campanelli - lousto metrics are mapped to the einstein frame and their conformal cousins are regarded as gr solutions ( _ i.e. _ , with fixed units ) , they always generate a subclass of the fisher - janis - newman - winicour solution containing a naked singularity .",
    "the lack of a one - to - one correspondence between black holes in the jordan and einstein frames ( in the absence of scaling units ) was already noted in @xcite , although the difference between scaling units and fixed units was not noted .",
    "the moral is that there is a big difference between the einstein frame with varying units of time , length and mass ( and of course , derived units scaling in the appropriate way ) and gr with fixed units .",
    "the campanelli - lousto and veiled schwarzschild spacetimes demonstrate this difference .",
    "we have then studied the veiled version of the riegert black hole solution of weyl gravity , which is a conformally invariant theory . even in this situation ,",
    "the conformal transformation of the riegert black hole generates , as a solution of the same theory , a wormhole without trapped regions .",
    "our discussion induces a word of caution when using conformal transformations to an einstein frame and drawing physical interpretations of the mathematical results . in such situations , properties which seem obvious",
    "are not always true .",
    "consider a photon starting at spatial infinity which , in the absence of a gravitational lens , would have as unperturbed path the @xmath130-axis and the unperturbed four - momentum @xmath131 in cartesian coordinates @xmath132 .",
    "let us introduce now a spherical lens of mass @xmath73 described by the schwarzschild metric  ( [ schwarzschild ] ) and assume that lensing occurs in the weak - field regime .",
    "the photon four - momentum is now @xmath133 and satisfies the null geodesic equation @xmath134 which , to first order in the deflections , reduces to @xmath135 where @xmath136 and the metric is expressed as the minkowski metric plus perturbations , @xmath137 .",
    "integrating along the photon path between the source and the observer gives @xmath138 where to first order it is legitimate to approximate the photon path with the unperturbed path ( the @xmath130-axis ) along which @xmath139 .    in the veiled schwarzschild spacetime  ( [ veiled ] )",
    "the null geodesic equation is still satisfied by the four - momentum @xmath140 of the photon , @xmath141 strictly speaking , a conformal transformation can change an affinely - parametrized geodesic into a non - affinely parametrized one , but it is possible to reparametrize the null geodesic using an affine parameter such that the @xmath130-axis coincides with the unperturbed photon path and @xmath142 , and we assume that this has been done . using the relation between the christoffel symbols of conformally related spacetimes @xmath143 one obtains @xmath144   p^{\\alpha}_{(0)}p^{\\beta}_{(0 ) }   \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating along the unperturbed photon path between source and observer yields @xmath145   p^{\\alpha}_{(0)}p^{\\beta}_{(0 ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and using the fact that @xmath146 it is @xmath147_s^o   -4\\delta^{\\mu}_3 \\left [ \\ln \\omega \\right]_s^o   \\,.\\ ] ] since the light source and the observer are in the asymptotic region , the terms in square brackets vanish and one obtains @xmath148 , as expected from the independent knowledge that null geodesics are conformally invariant .",
    "this result then produces the same deflection angle and the same operational determination of lens mass in the schwarzschild metric and in the veiled schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "here we discuss a geometrical interpretation of the double trapping horizon of a veiled black hole - wormhole with regard to the so - called light sphere of the original unveiled black hole .",
    "we recall that , given a spherically symmetric black hole solution in the form @xmath149 one can determine the associated light sphere by studying the equation of motion of classical relativistic massless particles . for a massless particle ,",
    "it is well - known that the associated lagrangian may be written in the form @xmath150 @xmath151 being the einbein and @xmath152 a suitable evolution parameter .",
    "we may deparametrize this relativistic reparametrization - invariant system by making the choice @xmath153 , for angular variable . then , choosing the other angular variable @xmath154 , eliminating the einbein @xmath151 , and making use of two other constants of motion @xmath155 and @xmath156 associated with the conservation of energy and angular momentum , respectively , a textbook approach provides the equation of motion for the trajectory as well as the first integral of motion @xmath157 as is well - known , it is convenient to make use of the newton variable @xmath158",
    ". then , the equation of motion of the light trajectory reduces to @xmath159 the light sphere is defined by @xmath160 , describing a circular trajectory with constant radius . as a result",
    ", the radius is determined by @xmath161 in terms of the original radial coordinate @xmath16 , one has @xmath162 which corresponds to the extremal property of the areal radius of the related `` veiled black hole '' @xmath163 this property still holds true for a topological black hole .",
    "however , the light sphere may not exist .",
    "for example , let us consider the topological black holes in the presence of negative or positive cosmological constant @xmath164 @xcite where @xmath165 with @xmath166 and where @xmath84 is a mass parameter , which in the case @xmath81 may be negative .",
    "the radius of the light sphere must satisfy @xmath167 note that this condition does not depend on @xmath164 .",
    "for example , for @xmath79 ( toroidal black hole ) , there is no finite light sphere . for @xmath77",
    ", @xmath5 must be bigger than the event horizon , and for @xmath168 , @xmath169 , one obtains the well - known result for the scharzschild solution . for @xmath81 and @xmath170",
    ", the condition may be satisfied for a restricted range of the mass parameter @xmath84 .",
