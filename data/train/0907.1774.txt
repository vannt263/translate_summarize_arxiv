    "<S> we propose an ultradiscrete analogue of the vertex operator in the case of the ultradiscrete kdv equation , which maps @xmath0-soliton solutions to @xmath1-soliton ones .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : integrable systems ; solitons ; discrete systems ; cellular automaton ; kdv equation    the ultradiscrete kdv equation ( udkdveq ) @xmath2 was first proposed in @xcite to describe the dynamics of the box and ball system ( bbs ) @xcite , which is a cellular automaton with soliton - like behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> it has a rich structure , including the existence of @xmath0-soliton solutions and an infinite amount of conserved quantities @xcite like most ordinary soliton equations .    </S>",
    "<S> a procedure to obtain a new solution of a soliton equation from a given one , is known under the name of bcklund transformation ( bt ) and is generally expressed in the form of the differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> the ultradiscrete analogue of the bt for the kdv equation in the case of the udkdveq is presented in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the vertex operator is an operator representation of a bt and was first presented in @xcite to describe the structure of the solutions and the symmetries of soliton systems . </S>",
    "<S> it maps @xmath0-soliton solutions to @xmath1-soliton ones and all soliton solutions can in fact be generated by repeated application for the vertex operator .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an ultradiscrete analogue of vertex operator in the case of the ultradiscrete kdv equation and prove that the functions generated by this operator indeed solve the udkdveq .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we define the vertex operator and consider the functions generated by this operator .    </S>",
    "<S> the multi - variable function @xmath3 and the vertex operator @xmath4 are defined as follows :    </S>",
    "<S> 1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the null variable function @xmath5 is defined as : @xmath6 2 .   the vertex operator @xmath4 depends one real parameter @xmath7 and a function @xmath8 of @xmath9 , and maps the null variable function @xmath5 to @xmath10 accordingly , the one variable function @xmath11 is defined as : @xmath12 3 .   for general @xmath13 , the vertex operator @xmath4 maps an @xmath0 variable function @xmath14 ( written as @xmath15 for brevity ) to the @xmath1 variable function as : @xmath16 where @xmath17    the parameters @xmath18 and the functions @xmath19 in the vertex operator @xmath4 are in fact the amplitudes and phase parameter of the new soliton , inserted by the operator . </S>",
    "<S> the definition ( [ symexformula ] ) indicates that all pre - existing solitons described by @xmath3 , have their phases shifted by inserting a new soliton .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present the basic properties of the operator @xmath4 and the corresponding function @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ sym ] the action of the vertex operators are commutative .    </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath20 directly following the definition ( [ symexformula ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 from this relation it is clear that interchanging the subscripts @xmath22 and @xmath23 does not change its overall value .    rewriting this proposition in the language of the function @xmath3 , yields the following corollary :    [ cor1 ] the @xmath0 variable functions @xmath24 are invariant under the permutation of their parameters , i.e. : @xmath25    next , let us prove that these functions are indeed solutions of the udkdveq , by means of the recursive form ( [ symexformula ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this property indicates that the vertex operator defined in ( [ symexformula ] ) is nothing but the operator , well known from soliton theory , which maps an @xmath0-soliton solution to an @xmath1-soliton solution .    </S>",
    "<S> [ thm1 ] the @xmath0 variable function @xmath15 solves the udkdveq ( [ bilinear ] ) for @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a constant .    by virtue of corollary [ cor1 ] , we can fix the labels of the parameters @xmath29 without loss of generality . by virtue of this ordering </S>",
    "<S> , the phase shifts in definition ( [ symexformula ] ) simplify to @xmath30 it should be noted that the phase shifts @xmath31 are equivalent to the time shifts @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 variable function @xmath15 is then reduced to @xmath33 , written as @xmath34 we shall prove the theorem inductively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath35 solves the equation ( [ bilinear ] ) because of the positivity of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> now , let us assume that the theorem holds for @xmath37 . by substituting ( [ exformula ] ) in the udkdveq ( [ bilinear ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the left hand side can be rewritten as @xmath38 in this expression it looks as if the maximum in ( [ ff1 ] ) has four arguments . </S>",
    "<S> however , the third argument can not be the maximum because it is always less than the fourth one by virtue of the following lemma , in cases @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lem1 ] let @xmath40 where parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> then the relation @xmath44 holds .    to prove this lemma , </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce some fundamental properties of the @xmath45 operator .    </S>",
    "<S> the inequalities @xmath46 hold for arbitrary @xmath47    proof of ( [ maxeq1 ] ) : the right hand side of the equation ( [ maxeq1 ] ) can be expanded to yield @xmath48 , which includes all candidates of the left hand side .    </S>",
    "<S> proof of ( [ maxeq2 ] ) : put @xmath49 in ( [ maxeq1 ] ) respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> if we now apply @xmath50 we obtain the following corollary :    [ cor2 ] the above inequalities ( [ maxeq1 ] ) , ( [ maxeq2 ] ) hold even when @xmath45 and @xmath51 are replaced by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    by employing the inequality ( [ maxeq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath54 adding the inequalities yields @xmath55 by taking into account the relation @xmath56 , it can be shown inductively that the four arguments in this maximum are all less than @xmath57 .    by means of the same procedure , the right hand side of equation ( [ bilinear ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is rewritten as @xmath58 there are three arguments in the principal maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the first and second arguments are the same as those on the left hand side because @xmath59 solves the equation ( [ bilinear ] ) by the assumption . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be shown that the last argument is also the same by employing the method which was used to prove lemma [ lem1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the condition which expresses the equality of the last argument to that of the left hand side then reduces : @xmath60 and holds by virtue of the following lemma :    [ lem2 ] let @xmath61 one then has : @xmath62    by employing the inequality ( [ maxeq2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath63 adding these inequalities , we obtain @xmath64 noticing that the condition for the third argument to be the maximum of all four : @xmath65 reduces to @xmath66 it can be shown inductively that all arguments are less than @xmath67 </S>",
    "<S> .    the positivity of @xmath68 is proven by a similar evaluation by means of corollary [ cor2 ] .    finally , we give an explicit example of the action of the vertex operator @xmath4 , in case of the box and ball system . </S>",
    "<S> the bbs corresponds to the udkdveq ( [ bilinear ] ) by means of the dependent variable transformation @xmath69 and expressed as : @xmath70 the bbs is required to satisfy the following boundary conditions : for sufficiently large j , @xmath71 . under these conditions </S>",
    "<S> , it can be shown that the possible values of the variable @xmath72 that correspond to the @xmath0-soliton solutions of theorem [ thm1 ] ( i.e. constructed by means of the vertex operator @xmath4 ) are restricted to the set @xmath73 .    in the following figures we depict the @xmath74-lattice by a row of boxes , containing a ball when @xmath72 is equal to @xmath75 , and empty whenever @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattices depicted in figure . [ pic1 ] are the vacuum lattice , and the lattices that obtained from vacuum by the successive application of the vertex operator @xmath4 with parameter values @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .          in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we proposed an ultradiscrete analogue of the vertex operator for the ultradiscrete kdv equation and discussed its properties . </S>",
    "<S> we presented a recursive representation of the @xmath0-soliton solution generated by this operator and proved that it indeed solves the udkdveq .    in @xcite , a different technique for describing the udkdv @xmath0-soliton solutions </S>",
    "<S> was introduced , relying on signature - free casorati - type determinants or permanents . </S>",
    "<S> although these permanents describe the same solutions ( already proposed in @xcite ) as those constructed by recursive application of the ultradiscrete vertex operator , we would like to stress that the two aproaches are quite different . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the vertex operator approach is closely related to the existence of certain symmetry algebras for integrable systems and the exact relation of our ultradiscrete operator to the symmetries of ultradiscrete systems is an especially interesting problem we want to address in the future . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be interesting to find vertex operators for other ultradiscrete soliton equations , as for example the ultradiscrete analogue of the kp equation . </S>"
