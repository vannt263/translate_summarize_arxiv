    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are among the most popular candidates for the relic cold dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "there is some revival of interest in the wimp - nucleus spin - dependent interaction from both theoretical ( see e.g. @xcite ) and experimental ( see e.g. @xcite ) points of view . there are some proposals aimed at direct dm detection with relatively low - mass isotope targets @xcite as well as some attempts to design and construct a dm detector which is sensitive to the nuclear recoil direction @xcite .",
    "low - mass targets make preference for the low - mass wimps and are more sensitive to the spin - dependent wimp - nucleus interaction as well @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "wimps with masses about 100 gev/@xmath2 follow from the results of the dark matter ( dama ) experiment .",
    "this collaboration claimed observation of the first evidence for the dark matter signal due to registration of the annual modulation effect @xcite . aimed for more than one decade at the dm particle direct detection , the dama experiment with 100-kg highly radio - pure nai(tl ) scintillator detectors successfully operated till july 2002 at the gran sasso national laboratory of the i.n.f.n .",
    "on the basis of the results obtained for over 7 annual cycles ( 107731  kg@xmath3day total exposure ) the effectiveness of the wimp model - independent annual modulation signature was demonstrated and the wimp presence in the galactic halo is strongly supported at 6.3 @xmath4 c.l . @xcite .    the goal of this review ( being a continuation of our previous review paper @xcite ) is to complete our nuclear physics consideration of the spin - dependent ( or axial - vector ) interaction of dark matter particles with nuclei .",
    "this type of interaction of the dm particles is important for the following reasons : ( i ) the spin - dependent interaction of the dm particles provides us with twice stronger constraints on the susy parameter space in comparison with the spin - independent interaction ; ( ii ) in the case of spin - dependent interaction of heavy wimps with heavy target nuclei the so - called long @xmath5-tail behavior of the relevant form  factor allows detection of large nuclear recoil energy due to some nuclear structure effects ; ( iii ) it is worthwhile to note that by relying only upon the scalar interaction of the dm particles , which seems to be strongly suppressed , one might miss a dm signal @xcite .",
    "however , by a simultaneous study of both spin - dependent and spin - independent interactions of the dm particles with nuclei the chance for observing the dm signal is significantly increased .",
    "a dark matter event is elastic scattering of a relic wimp ( or neutralino ) @xmath6 with mass @xmath7 from a target nucleus @xmath8 producing a nuclear recoil @xmath9 which can be detected by a suitable detector . the differential event rate in respect to the recoil energy is the subject of experimental measurements .",
    "the rate depends on the distribution of the relic wimps in the solar vicinity @xmath10 and the cross section of wimp - nucleus elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "the differential event rate per unit mass of the target material has the form @xmath11 we assume wimps ( neutralinos ) to be a dominant component of the dm halo of our galaxy with a density @xmath12 = 0.3 gev@xmath13@xmath14 in the solar vicinity .",
    "the nuclear recoil energy @xmath15 is typically about @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the number density of a target nuclei with mass @xmath18 .",
    "the wimp - nucleus differential elastic scattering cross section for spin - non - zero ( @xmath19 ) nuclei contains coherent ( spin - independent , or si ) and axial ( spin - dependent , or sd ) terms @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the reduced wimp - nucleus mass , @xmath22 $ ] is the spin - independent wimp - nucleus total elastic cross section at @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the normalized ( @xmath25 ) nozero - momentum - transfer spin - independent nuclear form - factor .",
    "the @xmath26-dependence of the sd cross section is governed by the spin - dependent structure function @xmath27 of engel et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath28 the transverse electric @xmath29 and longitudinal @xmath30 multipole projections of the axial vector current operator are given in the appendix .",
    "relic wimps in the halo of our galaxy have a mean velocity of @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) where @xmath34 is the nuclear size and @xmath35 is the maximum of the momentum transfer in the @xmath6-nucleus scattering , the spin structure function @xmath36 reduces to ( so - called _ zero transfer momentum limit _ ) @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the proton ( or neutron ) spin averaged over nucleus @xmath8 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the effective spin wimp - neutron and wimp - proton couplings that contain details of the supersymmetric model , as well as the quark spin content of the proton and neutron .    as @xmath41 increases , @xmath42 ( the product @xmath43 starts to become non - negligible ) and _ the finite momentum transfer limit _ must be considered for heavier nuclei .",
    "the formalism is a straight forward extension of that developed for the study of weak and electromagnetic semi - leptonic interactions in nuclei .",
    "here we follow the definitions of @xcite . with the isoscalar spin coupling constant @xmath44 and the isovector spin coupling constant @xmath45",
    "one can split the nuclear structure function @xmath46 into a pure isoscalar term , @xmath47 , a pure isovector term , @xmath48 , and an interference term , @xmath49 , in the following way : @xmath50 these three partial structure functions contain expectation values of operators of the form @xmath51^{l",

    "these three partial structure functions @xmath59 allow calculation of spin - dependent cross sections for any heavy majorana particle as well as for the neutralino with arbitrary composition @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend our consideration of the modern nuclear spin structure calculations involved into the problem of the direct dark matter search .",
    "the calculations of the proton and neutron spins @xmath60 averaged over all nucleons in the nucleus @xmath8 , which are relevant to the zero - momentum neutralino - nucleon spin cross sections , are considered in our previous review @xcite .",
    "the cross sections at zero momentum transfer show strong dependence on the nuclear structure of the ground state @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the calculations of the spin structure functions in the _ finite _ momentum transfer approximation .",
    "we also touch upon the level of accuracy of these calculations .",
    "finally , ( in the last section ) we briefly discuss a new approach to data analysis in the finite momentum transfer approximation directly in terms of the effective spin nucleon couplings @xmath61 together with the scalar wimp - proton cross section @xmath62 at @xmath53 .",
    "contrary to other possibilities , ( see for example , @xcite ) , this procedure is direct and relies as much as possible on the results of the most accurate nuclear spin structure calculations .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the finite , non - zero momentum transfer calculations of the spin nuclear structure functions @xmath46 have been performed for the set of isotopes given in table  [ list.sd-non-0 ] .",

    "even though the probability of finding a pure @xmath66 neutron hole in the @xmath68 ground state of @xmath65pb is greater than 95% , the ground state magnetic moment is quenched due to the @xmath69 @xmath70-@xmath71 excitation involving the spin orbit partners .",

    "[ s207-bva ] as a function of the recoil energy .    concluding the discussion of lead structure functions we note , following @xcite , that for a heavy nucleus and a high wimp mass the momentum transfer dependence of the spin monopole ( @xmath72 ) matrix elements is quite large .",
    "it is , however , to a large extent neutralized by the spin quadrupole @xmath79 .",
    "thus the overall effect is not dramatic for wimp masses less than 100 gev . for the spin - induced cross section of heavy odd - a nuclear targets , as in the case of @xmath65pb ,",
    "the reduction is less pronounced since the high multipoles tend to enhance the cross section as the momentum transfer increases ( for lsp mass @xmath80 200 gev ) and partially cancel the momentum reduction @xcite .",
    "to perform the data analysis in the finite momentum transfer approximation directly in terms of the effective spin nucleon couplings @xmath61 together with the scalar wimp - proton cross section @xmath62 we propose to use formulas schematically given below .",

    "the general feature is that spin matrix elements depend in general rather sensitively on the details of the nuclear structure . for a rather heavy wimp ( or light supersymmetric particle ) and sufficiently heavy nuclei ,",
