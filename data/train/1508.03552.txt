    "consider the plane strain problem for a single crystal containing a crack lying on the left - half of the @xmath3-axis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the depth of the crystal in the @xmath4-direction is taken large enough to guarantee the plane strain state having two non - zero components of displacement vector @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the crystal is oriented in such a way that its lattice and mechanical properties as well as the loading condition ( say tractions acting at the outer boundary ) are symmetric with respect to the reflection about the @xmath3-axis . because of this mirror symmetry it is sufficient to consider the upper - half of the crystal .",
    "if the load is small enough , then it is natural to assume that the crystal with this crack deforms elastically .",
    "however , if the load exceeds some threshold value , dislocations can occur causing the plastic deformation of the crystal .",
    "we assume that , during this plastic deformation , only one slip system from each half of the crystal is active and the dislocations are straight lines parallel to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "for the more realistic crack problems in single fcc and bcc crystals having several active slip systems the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "letting @xmath7 denote the slip directions , and @xmath8 the normal vector to the slip planes of the slip system in the upper - half of the crystal , we may express the plain strain plastic distortion tensor in the form @xmath9 .",
    "we are going to determine the displacements @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and the plastic slip @xmath12 near the crack tip during this plastic deformation .",
    "for the plane strain state the non - zero in - plane components of the symmetric strain tensor @xmath13 are @xmath14 throughout the paper the comma standing before an index is used to denote the partial derivative with respect to the corresponding coordinate .",
    "the in - plane components of the symmetric plastic strain tensor @xmath15 equal @xmath16 with these total and plastic strain tensors we obtain the in - plane components of the symmetric elastic strain tensor @xmath17 in the form @xmath18 let us compute nye - bilby - krner s dislocation density tensor ( introduced in @xcite-@xcite ) @xmath19 , with @xmath20 being the vector product .",
    "for the plane strain plastic slip @xmath12 there are two non - zero components of this tensor given by @xmath21 these are the component of the net burgers vector of all excess dislocations whose dislocation lines cut the area perpendicular to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "thus , the net burgers vector of excess dislocations shows in the slip direction @xmath22 indicating that we are dealing with the edge dislocations only . the scalar dislocation density ( or the number of dislocations per unit area ) equals @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "similar quantities in the lower - half plane can be obtained if we replace in the above formulas @xmath25 by @xmath26 .",
    "for most metals the elastic strain tensor @xmath27 is usually small .",
    "therefore the free energy density per unit volume of the crystal with continuously distributed dislocations can be proposed in the form @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 the lam s constants , @xmath31 the saturated dislocation density , and @xmath32 the material constant .",
    "the first two terms in represents the contribution to the energy due to the elastic strain , while the last term corresponds to the energy of the dislocation network .",
    "the logarithmic energy term stems from two facts : ( i ) energy of the dislocation network for small dislocation densities is the sum of energy of non - interacting dislocations ( see the reasonings based on the statistical mechanics of dislocations in @xcite , and ( ii ) there exists a saturated dislocation density which characterizes the closest packing of dislocations admissible in the discrete crystal lattice .",
    "the logarithmic term @xcite ensures a linear increase of the energy for small dislocation density @xmath33 and tends to infinity as @xmath33 approaches the saturated dislocation density @xmath34 hence providing an energetic barrier against over - saturation . for small up to",
    "moderate dislocation densities this logarithmic term can be replaced by its taylor expansion @xmath35 for simplicity of the subsequent analysis we shall use this approximation only .",
    "taking all the above formulas into account , we write the bulk energy density per unit volume of the crystal with continuously distributed dislocations in the form @xmath36 the energy functional per unit depth of the crystal becomes @xmath37=\\int_{\\omega } \\biggl [ \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda ( u_{1,1}+u_{2,2})^2+\\mu ( u_{1,1}+\\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\sin 2\\varphi ) ^2+\\mu ( u_{2,2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\sin 2\\varphi ) ^2",
    "\\\\ + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu ( u_{1,2}+u_{2,1}-\\beta \\cos 2\\varphi ) ^2+\\mu k ( \\frac{|\\partial _ s \\beta |}{b\\rho_{s}}+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(\\partial _ s \\beta ) ^2}{b^2\\rho _ s^2 } ) \\,\\biggr ] \\ , dx , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the domain occupied by the undeformed crystal having the crack and @xmath39 .",
    "since we are interested in the fields near the crack tip , the virtual work of the traction acting at the outer boundary is dropped in this functional .",
    "we require that the displacements @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the plastic slip @xmath42 be continuous on the positive @xmath3-axis . on the contrary , on the crack",
    "faces @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( which are assumed to be not in contact with each other in the deformed state for the mode i crack ) no constraints are imposed on @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( free boundary ) .",
    "provided the dissipation caused by the dislocation motion is negligible , then the true displacements @xmath40 , @xmath41 and plastic slip @xmath45 in the _ final _ state of equilibrium minimize energy functional among all admissible displacements and plastic slips satisfying the above boundary conditions .",
    "let us derive the equilibrium equations and boundary conditions for the true displacement vector and the plastic slip . for plane strain problems it is convenient to use the index notation with the greek indices running from 1 to 2 and with the summation convention being applied for two - dimensional components of vectors and tensors .",
    "then , for instance , the elastic strain tensor has the following non - zero components @xmath46 keeping this index notation in mind , we compute now the first variation of the energy functional @xmath47\\ , dx,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 s_\\alpha . \\end{split}\\ ] ] we call @xmath49 the ( symmetric ) cauchy stress tensor , and @xmath50 the higher order stress vector .",
    "integrating by parts and omitting the surface integral at the outer boundary , we obtain @xmath51\\ , dx-\\int_{x_1<0}(\\sigma _ { \\alpha 2}\\delta u_\\alpha + \\kappa _ 2\\delta \\beta)|^{x_2=+0}_{x_2=-0}dx_1,\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the resolved shear stress ( or schmid stress ) .",
    "thus , the equation @xmath53 , together with the arbitrariness of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , implies the equilibrium equations of macro - forces acting on the material volume element @xmath56 and of micro - forces acting on dislocations @xmath57 in @xmath38 , as well as @xmath58 in addition to these we can pose the boundary condition @xmath59 which is simply the consequence of the mirror symmetry of the crack problem .",
    "the system of equations , , together with the boundary conditions and constitute the local crack problem to determine the displacements @xmath60 and the plastic slip @xmath42 .    to get the governing equations in terms of displacements and plastic slip we substitute the constitutive equations , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 from and , into the equilibrium equations and .",
    "this leads to @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    "near the crack tip different terms in the governing equations and will have different orders of smallness .",
    "it is convenient to do the asymptotic analysis of these equations in the polar coordinate system @xmath2 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 let us assume the asymptotically main terms for displacements and plastic slip near the crack tip in the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are unknown functions describing the angular distribution of the displacements and plastic slip , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are unknown numbers . since the displacements and the plastic slip can not be singular at the crack tip , both @xmath71 and @xmath70 must be positive .",
    "besides , based on the solutions of other similar crack problems we may assume that @xmath70 lies in the interval @xmath72 .",
    "we substitute asymptotic formulas into the governing equations and use the transformation rules @xmath73=\\left[\\begin{array}{cr }      \\cos\\theta\\quad&-\\frac{1}{r}\\sin\\theta\\\\      \\sin\\theta\\quad&\\frac{1}{r}\\cos\\theta      \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{l }      \\partial_r\\\\      \\partial_\\theta      \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ] to compute the derivatives . according to these transformation rules ,",
    "the first derivatives reduce the power of @xmath2 by one , and the second derivatives by two .",
    "thus , the asymptotically main terms in are the first two because the last one has the order @xmath74 which is small compared with @xmath75 . neglecting this last term in equations we get lam s equations of linear elasticity that are uncoupled from equation .",
    "likewise , the boundary conditions @xmath76 , after neglecting the last small term containing @xmath42 , reduces to @xmath77 so we get the plane strain elastic crack problem that can be solved by using the airy stress function .",
    "the well - known solution of this problem shows that @xmath78 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . besides , for mode i crack @xmath79 and @xmath80,\\\\ \\sigma _ { 22}=\\frac{k_i}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\cos \\frac{\\theta } { 2 } \\left[1+\\sin \\frac{\\theta } { 2 } \\sin \\frac{3\\theta } { 2 } \\right],\\\\ \\sigma _",

    "exhibit a linear work hardening as shown in @xcite-@xcite , this square root stress singularity agrees with the classical result obtained by @xcite in conventional plasticity .",
    "note also that the account of dissipation as proposed in @xcite-@xcite does not affect this result .",
    "we turn now to equation .",
    "if @xmath82 $ ] , then the asymptotically principal term in this equation is obviously the last one , because it has the order @xmath83 which is much larger than the orders of the first two . neglecting the small terms in",
    "we get a simple equation @xmath84 the continuous solution of this equation @xmath85 with @xmath86 being the distance from the @xmath3-axis in the @xmath22-direction and @xmath87 a constant dislocation density , would satisfy the equation and the boundary condition identically , but violate the boundary condition @xmath88 s_2=0\\ ] ] on the crack faces .",
    "this is not surprising , because we know that the free boundary attracts dislocations , so the constant dislocation distribution can not stay in equilibrium near the crack faces .",
    "therefore @xmath71 can not lie in the segment @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath90 the back - stress must be balanced with the resolved shear stress ( having the power @xmath91 ) to guarantee the equilibrium of micro - forces acting on dislocations .",
    "therefore @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "now we substitute this ansatz into equation and maintain the terms of order @xmath91 in it .",
    "then equation becomes @xmath94 where the stress components must be taken from . to compute the back stress we use the following formulas @xmath95g(\\theta)-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin2\\theta g^{\\prime}(\\theta)+\\sin^{2}(\\theta)g^{\\prime\\prime}(\\theta)\\right\\ } , \\\\",

    "then we must combine the solutions in two intervals taking into account the continuity of the dislocation density and the analytic continuation of @xmath42 across the singular point @xmath106 .",

    "these issues , as well as the question of the crack growth , will be addressed in our forthcoming papers .",
    "last but not least , it would be quite convincing if this theoretical result for the dislocation distribution could be compared with the experimental observations and measurements .",
