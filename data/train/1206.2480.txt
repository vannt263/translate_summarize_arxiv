    "an important technique in continuum field theory , is the functional renormalization group @xcite , which represents a powerful method to approach both perturbative and non - perturbative phenomena ; it is based on the infinitesimal integration of momentum modes from a path integral representation of the theory with the help of a wilsonian momentum cutoff @xcite .",
    "the resulting functional flow equations interpolate between the microscopic theory at short distances and the full quantum effective theory at large distances .    in the past years",
    "various realizations of the functional renormalization group were developed and , among the most renowned , there are polchinski s and wetterich s formulations ( for reviews see @xcite @xcite ) . at the same time , the derivative expansion , a powerful approximation scheme that relies on a small anomalous dimension of the field , was introduced to reduce the full flow equation to a small set of treatable partial differential equations @xcite , more recently , a different approximation scheme was presented in @xcite , where the flow , rather than being projected on the semi - local derivative expansion of the action , is projected on the @xmath5-point 1-particle irreducible ( 1pi ) vertices , so that the momentum dependence of the correlation functions is properly taken into account .",
    "the range of application of the functional renormalization group is wide and it is especially suitable for the study of phase transitions , due to its flexibility even in the presence of strong correlations or couplings . for instance",
    "fixed point studies of ising - like or @xmath1 theories , including the determination of universal critical indices , were repeatedly carried out , using different versions of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow equation ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) , both to analyze the properties of the theory and to test the accuracy of the method through a comparison with other field - theoretical techniques ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some attention has also been devoted to the study of the non - perturbative features of the effective action and effective potential in the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "in fact is it a well known result of quantum field theory @xcite that the effective potential defined through a legendre transformation must be convex , a property that , in the limit of infinite volume , leads to a non - analytic behavior with a typical degenerate flat region of the potential in correspondence of the classically forbidden region between the classical minima .",
    "the convexity of the potential can only be recovered by resorting to some non - perturbative scheme ( see e.g. @xcite ) and it has already been studied by means of rg techniques @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze in detail the spontaneously broken phase of the @xmath1-symmetric scalar theory , for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in four euclidean dimensions , @xmath4 , going beyond the local potential approximation ( lpa ) and including the effects of the field renormalization . instead of deriving the flow equations for the potential @xmath6 and the field renormalization @xmath7 directly from an expansion of the full flow equation for the effective action around a constant field configuration , we shall derive them starting from the approach developed in @xcite and adopting the regulator for the infrared modes introduced in @xcite , which has the specific property of optimizing the determination of the critical exponents in the lpa .",
    "this particular choice allows us to analytically perform the integration over the momentum variable , which simplifies the structure of coupled partial differential equations ( pdes ) for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the aim of the present analysis is to provide a better understanding of the details of this phenomenon which , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , could provide some indications on the description of the broken chiral symmetry phase for a two - flavor quark model or on the mass generation mechanism in the standard model , although in both cases the similarity has serious limitations .",
    "in fact , in the former case the @xmath8 model is in the correct universality class to describe the universal features of the chiral phase transition , but when the system is not close to the critical line , which is the case considered here , then some properties of the fermionic model could be poorly reproduced by the scalar fields .",
    "concerning the latter case , the coupling to gauge fields is turned off in the @xmath1 model and therefore the massless golstone bosons play an important role in the infrared sector of the ordered phase and this could lead to a different behavior with respect to the usual higgs mechanism where the goldstone are replaced by the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the massive gauge bosons which , due to their mass , are less relevant for the infrared dynamics .",
    "an attempt to use the two coupled flow equations for @xmath6 and @xmath7 in this context was already done in @xcite for the simple quanto - mechanical problem ( @xmath9 dimensions ) and in @xcite for the @xmath2 scalar theory in @xmath4 dimensions . in both cases the proper time version of the rg flow @xcite ( which can be regarded as an approximation to the class of exact background field flows @xcite )",
    "was adopted in the exponential form , which is derived by using a sharp cut - off on the proper time variable @xcite . in the quanto - mechanical case the corrections induced by the inclusion of @xmath7 turned out to be in very good agreement with the ( exact ) schroedinger equation output while",
    ", for the quantum field theory , a very large @xmath7 was observed in the classically forbidden region .",
    "however , in the latter case , only partial conclusions could be drawn , because the numerical instabilities in the flow equations made rather difficult the approach to the infrared ( ir ) limit , where all quantum modes are integrated out and the full field renormalization is obtained . on the contrary , the approach used in this paper , based on a different approximation scheme , turns out to be numerically more stable , thus allowing us to push the rg scale low enough to get a better insight of the ir region .",
    "the scheme of the paper is the following . in sect .",
    "ii the main details of the rg flow equations and of the approximation used are recalled ; the results of the numerical analysis of the potential and the field renormalization for the single field , @xmath2 , and for the @xmath3 theory in @xmath4 are shown in sect .",
    "the conclusions are reported in sect .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the partition function of the theory , defined as a functional of the source @xmath10 , and also dependent on the momentum scale @xmath11 : [ zetacappa ] z_k[j]= e^-s - s_k+_x j .",

    "this scheme consists in an expansion in terms of the @xmath5-point functions , @xmath35 , i.e. the @xmath5-th functional derivative of @xmath24 $ ] with respect to the field @xmath36 .",

    "@xmath0    this is essentially what was expected .",
    "indeed , it is known that at @xmath20 the potential must reproduce the features of the effective potential which is convex , with a flat region for @xmath142 and with a non - analytic behavior , that consists in a jump of the second derivative of the potential at @xmath108 from zero to a finite value . as a consequence , the computation of the zero momentum green functions from the derivatives of the effective potential",
    "is typically obtained by taking the limit of the derivatives from above , @xmath143 with @xmath140 , while the limit from below ( with @xmath144 ) is associated to tunneling processes with infinitely large time scales . in our numerical analysis the flat part of curve ( *",

    "let us now focus on the other variables , that is the field renormalization @xmath53 and @xmath159 .",
    "the qualitative behavior of the field renormalization is already illustrated in @xcite .",

    ", the large size of the peak found in @xcite could be addressed to that version of the flow equation which artificially amplifies the behavior of @xmath53 close to @xmath110 . on the other hand",
    "the approach followed in this paper is expected to be more accurate at quantitative level and therefore more suitable to describe this particular feature .",

    "we note that both @xmath53 of the @xmath2 theory and the transverse component @xmath63 of the @xmath3 theory show a very sharp drop followed by a drastic change of slope .",
    "however , by comparing the scale of the @xmath165-axis in the left and right panel of fig .",
    "[ tre ] , it is evident that @xmath53 with @xmath2 is much steeper than @xmath63 with @xmath3 and , in particular , the drop observed in the @xmath2 case is very close ( within the numerical accuracy employed ) to a discontinuous jump .",
    "instead , the longitudinal component @xmath64 of the @xmath3 theory smoothly approaches the perturbative regime for @xmath166 and this , as shown below , yields a large ( if compared with the perturbative correction ) , finite prediction of @xmath167 .",
    "@xmath0    the structure of the flow equation of the field derivative is more complicated than the equation of the potential and even an approximate analytic solution is missing .",
    "however , from our numerical investigation we are now able to get some hints on the dependence of @xmath7 on various parameters such as the running scale @xmath11 or the bare coupling @xmath106 or the uv cut - off @xmath105 .",
    "we concentrate on those values of @xmath36 where @xmath7 can be reasonably extracted , and therefore we shall examine the origin @xmath121 and the point @xmath108 .",
    "we avoid instead to analyze the peak of @xmath7 which is often affected by large fluctuations .",
    "we start by observing that in our computation in fig .",
    "[ tre ] , for @xmath2 the minimum is at @xmath168 and one finds @xmath169 for @xmath170 at @xmath125 , so that a typical perturbative value is observed at @xmath110 .",
    "then one should conclude that @xmath171 , unless at @xmath20 the sharp drop of @xmath53 hits @xmath110 , in which case no precise determination of @xmath172 would be possible within our numerical accuracy .",
    "the data collected when @xmath11 approaches zero do not exclude either of these two alternatives . in the case of the @xmath3 theory one has @xmath173 and @xmath174 for @xmath175 at @xmath125 similar to what happens in the @xmath2 case with the difference that for @xmath2 the jump could reasonably turn into a discontinuity , as already noticed , while in @xmath3 the less steep drop reported in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ tre ] together with the smooth behavior of the potential around @xmath110 observed in fig .",
    "[ unobis ] , suggest that @xmath63 could not develop a discontinuous gap at @xmath20 . on the other hand , as it is evident from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ tre ] , the renormalization of the longitudinal field is more regular and the large peak decreases so smoothly that at @xmath110 one finds @xmath176 at @xmath125 .",
    "then , in this case it is possible to study the evolution of @xmath167 as a function of @xmath11 and eventually extrapolate its value at @xmath20 .    in fig .",
    "[ quattro ] we show some values of @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and of @xmath167 , obtained at small values of @xmath11 . in all cases @xmath127 , @xmath126 and @xmath4 . for the points at @xmath121 we found that the functional form f(k)=ak^2+b provides excellent fits to the data with @xmath179 , @xmath180 for @xmath2 and @xmath181 , @xmath182 for @xmath3 and the corresponding plots",
    "are also shown in fig .",
    "[ quattro ] . as in the case of the potential ,",
    "we observe here a quadratic dependence on the running scale @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath0    let us now consider @xmath167 .",
    "in this case the two expressions z_l=1.0056 + z_l=1.0131 + 0.4225 e^-14.6466 k fit equally well the data and we report both curves in fig . [ quattro ] . their extrapolation at @xmath20 yield two different ( of about @xmath183 ) values of @xmath64",
    "however , remarkably , the fitted points do not suggest a divergent behavior of @xmath184 at @xmath20 , but , on the contrary , indicate finite values not very distant from that found at @xmath125 .",
    "we take this as a general indication that for this variable no strong modifications should be expected in the range @xmath185 .    in figure",
    "[ cinque ] we show @xmath177 and @xmath178 versus @xmath186 , at @xmath125 and @xmath126 ; we also show @xmath177 and @xmath178 versus @xmath187 at @xmath125 and @xmath127 . except for the black circles ,",
    "the other points show a rapid bend downward for large @xmath85 and this is due to the approaching of the critical value of @xmath106 or @xmath105 , which signals the transition to the symmetric phase .",
    "apart from these points the two curves associated to circles and squares have the form @xmath188 which is a typical expansion in powers of the coupling ( for completeness we find @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 for the squares and @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 for the circles ) , while the points related to the field renormalization dependence on @xmath105 display a linear behavior in a large range of the uv cut - off .    finally in fig .",
    "[ sei ] we show two plots of @xmath167 , one versus @xmath187 with @xmath127 and the other versus @xmath186 with @xmath126 .",
    "all points are collected at @xmath125 .",
    "we observe a small dependence on the coupling with a small increase around @xmath127 followed by a drop when approaching the critical line .",
    "instead , we find a much stronger dependence on the cut - off with the field renormalization that reaches @xmath195 for @xmath196 . by excluding the two points at large @xmath105 , which are closer to the critical line , the other points are in good agreement with the curve @xmath197 , which can obviously be expanded in a polynomial .",
    "in this paper , we used the functional renormalization group to analyze the renormalization function of the scalar field in the @xmath2 theory and of the longitudinal and transverse components in the @xmath8-symmetric theory in four euclidean dimensions in the ordered phase where , due to spontaneous symmetry breaking , a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value @xmath198 is generated .",
    "in particular , the approximation scheme of @xcite on the rg flow equations with the cut - off in eq .",
    "( [ optimctf ] ) provides a set of numerically stable coupled pdes for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which allow us to approach the physical limit @xmath20 and to determine the main features of the field renormalization .",
    "we found that a large non - perturbative enhancement of @xmath7 occurs in the range of @xmath36 corresponding to the observed flattening of the potential .",
    "this effect in @xmath7 had already been observed in quantum mechanics @xcite and its large value in the classically forbidden region has also a direct interpretation in terms of suppression factor of the tunneling probability of a wave packet between two vacua @xcite . however , in field theory the numerical resolution of the equation is more problematical and a first indication of a large field renormalization for the @xmath2 case was obtained in @xcite .",
    "our analysis qualitatively confirms those findings , but the maximum value of the peak found here is largely reduced with respect to @xcite .",
    "in particular we found that for @xmath2 the potential @xmath39 develops a non - analytic behavior at @xmath110 in the limit @xmath31 and @xmath53 presents a peak followed by a sharp drop that occurs definitely for @xmath199 at @xmath125 ( which is the typical lower limit reachable by our numerical routine ) . if this should persist even at @xmath20 , then @xmath163 would be substantially perturbative ; otherwise if at @xmath20 the drop should occur at @xmath110 , then we were not able to obtain a reasonable determination of @xmath163 .",
    "the data collected close to @xmath141 do not exclude either of these two alternatives .",
    "in the @xmath3 theory the numerical analysis indicates that the potential does not develop a discontinuity in its second derivative with respect to @xmath36 , as in the @xmath2 case , and even the transverse component @xmath63 shows a less sharp plot than @xmath53 for @xmath2 , suggesting in this case a continuous behavior at @xmath110 and @xmath141 . at the same time the longitudinal component @xmath64 has a very high peak",
    "but the curve is so well behaved that it is possible to extract @xmath167 at various @xmath11 and its extrapolation down to @xmath20 remarkably leads to finite values .",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 on the uv cut - off and on the bare coupling has also been investigated and this provides an indication on the typical numerical range spanned by the field renormalization , although it must be recalled that , quantitatively , these results are affected by large uncertainties because even a very small numerical error in the estimate of @xmath110 induce large modifications in the determination of @xmath64 .",
