    "photometric observation of transits is one of the most powerful methods of planet detection .",
    "this method relies on a possibility that , if the planet s orbit is viewed nearly edge - on , the planet may repeatedly transit over the disk of its host star and periodically block a small fraction of the starlight .",
    "thus , by monitoring the host star s brightness , the planet s presence can be revealed by a small dip in the photometric lightcurve .",
    "the main properties of the planet , such as its physical radius and orbital period , can be inferred from transit observations .",
    "the spacing of transit lightcurves would be exactly the same over the course of observations if a planet moved on a strictly keplerian orbit .",
    "several dynamical effects , however , can produce deviations from the keplerian case and induce the transit timing variations ( ttvs ) .",
    "ttvs were originally proposed as a non - transiting planet detection method ( miralda - escud 2002 , agol et al .",
    "2005 , holman & murray 2005 ) , but have found more use in validating the transiting planet candidates from nasa s _ kepler _ mission ( e.g. , holman et al .",
    "2010 ; lissauer et al .",
    "only a handful of non - transiting planets have been so far detected and characterized from ttvs ( e.g. , nesvorn et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ) .",
    "a significant progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of various dynamical causes of ttvs .",
    "these efforts were pioneered by agol et al .",
    "heyl & gladman ( 2007 ) focused on a _ long - period _ interaction between planets and showed that the apsidal precession of their orbits can be detected only with a long ttv baseline .",
    "nesvorn & morbidelli ( 2008 ) , on the other hand , developed a general analytic model for _ short - period _ ttvs and showed that they can be used , under ideal circumstances , to uniquely determine the mass and orbital parameters of the interacting planets .",
    "explicit analytic formulas for short - period ttvs are now available for zeroth- ( agol et al .",
    "2005 , nesvorn & vokrouhlick 2014 , deck & agol 2015 ) and first - order terms ( agol & deck 2016 ) in planetary eccentricities .",
    "the important case of near - resonant ttvs was highlighted in lithwick et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for the first - order resonances and in deck & agol ( 2016 ) and hadden & lithwick ( 2016 ) for the second - order resonances .",
    "the near - resonant ttv signal is a special case of the short - periodic variations when one harmonic becomes amplified due to a proximity of the system to a mean motion resonance .",
    "vokrouhlick & nesvorn ( 2014 ) considered a case of co - orbital planets and showed that co - orbital ttvs are expected to have a characteristic saw - tooth profile ( for horseshoe orbits ) .    while the analytic works cited above cover a wide range of dynamically plausible planetary configurations , none of them ( except for agol et al .",
    "2005 ) considered the case of a fully resonant planetary system , where two ( or more ) orbits are _ inside _ a mean motion resonance ( e.g. , 2:1 , 3:2 ) .",
    "this case is important because planetary migration in a protoplanetary gas disk should bring early planets into resonances ( e.g. , masset & snellgrove 2001 ) . indeed , many known planetary systems are consistent with having resonant orbits ( e.g. , winn & fabrycky 2015 ) .",
    "this motivates us to consider the resonant case .",
    "our main goal is to understand how resonant ttvs arise , and how their period and amplitude scale with planetary parameters .",
    "the resonant case has not received much attention in the ttv literature so far at least in part because the resonant interaction of planets is complex and not easily amenable to analytic calculations .",
    "the short - periodic or near - resonant ttv signals , for example , can be computed with the standard methods of perturbation theory , where the unperturbed ( keplerian ) motion is inserted in the right - hand side of the dynamical equations , and a linear variation of the orbital elements is obtained by quadrature .",
    "this method fails for the fully resonant orbits mainly because the resonant dynamics is non - linear .    here",
    ", we take advantage of recent advances in the theoretical understanding of resonant dynamics ( e.g. , batygin & morbidelli 2013a ; hereafter bm13 ) and derive approximate formulas for ttvs of a resonant pair of exoplanets . in section 2 , we first give a summary of resonant ttvs .",
    "the goal of this section is to highlight the main results of this work .",
    "sections 3 and 4 explain how we obtained these results .",
    "we first show how a fully analytic solution can be obtained for a first - order resonance ( section 3 ) .",
    "we then proceed to expand the exact solution in the fourier series and explicitly derive the periods and amplitudes of the leading ttv terms ( section 4 ) .",
    "the application of these results to real planetary systems is left for future work .",
    "consider a planar system of two planets with masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbiting a central star with mass @xmath2 . the two planets gravitationally interact to produce ttvs .",
    "the ttvs signal of the two planets , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , can be approximated by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mean orbital frequency of planet @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the mean longitude , @xmath14 is eccentricity , and @xmath15 is the longitude of periapsis .",

    "both these approximations are tested in section 5 .",
    "here we just illustrate the validity of the fourier expansion for small libration amplitudes ( figures [ ttv1 ] and [ ttv2 ] ) .",

    "we assume that the photometric transits are detected for planets 1 and 2 , and that the orbital periods inferred from the transit ephemeris are such that orbital period ratio @xmath55 with small integer @xmath19 ( indicating near - resonant or resonant orbits ) .",
    "furthermore , ttvs are assumed to be detected for both planets . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider a realistic case with the available ttv data spanning several years of observations , which is not long enough to resolve the frequencies related to the apsidal precession of orbits .",
    "the first step of the ttv analysis is to apply the fourier analysis to the ttv data .",
    "this may reveal that the ttv signal contains a basic period . in principle",
    ", this period can be one of following two periods : ( 1 ) the super period defined as @xmath56 ( e.g , lithwick et al .",

    "( [ f ] ) .",

    "the results described in this work apply in the second case .",
    "section 3.7 explains how the libration period can be used to constrain planetary masses .",
    "specifically , @xmath57 ( agol et al . 2005 , holman et al . 2010 ) , and therefore larger planetary masses imply shorter ttv periods . for the 2:1 resonance with @xmath58 days and @xmath59 , for example",
    ", the libration period is @xmath60 yr ( section 3.7 ) .    in the next step",
    ", it can be useful to check if the fourier analysis of the ttv data provides evidence for harmonics of the basic period .",

    "( [ dl ] ) that the ttv amplitudes of the inner and outer planets , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are @xmath65 where we denoted @xmath66 .",

    "a similar analysis can be performed for @xmath72 .",

    "* the second- and higher - order resonant terms in planetary eccentricities were neglected in the perturbing function .",

    "v. * the exact solution of the second fundamental model of resonance was expanded in the taylor series in @xmath37 and only the terms @xmath399 were retained ( section 4.1 ) . in addition , the jacobi elliptic functions were written as the fourier series and only the lowest harmonics were retained .",
    "both these approximations limit the validity of our analytic ttv model to relatively small libration amplitudes .",
    "[ in principle , the methods described in section 4 can be used to obtain more general expressions . ]    here we perform tests of these assumptions to establish the domain of validity of our analytic model . to this end",

    "they are :    * a. * a full @xmath427-body integrator of eq .",
    "( [ ham1 ] ) and ( [ ham2 ] ) where the gravitational interaction of planets is taken into account exactly .",
    "we used the symplectic code known as swift ( levison & duncan 1994 ) with routines for an efficient and precise determination of ttvs ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2013 ; see also deck et al .",
    "2014 ) .    * b. * a numerical integrator in orbital elements that uses the laplacian expansion of the perturbing function .",
    "various terms can be included or excluded in this integrator . in the most basic approximation ,",
    "the code includes only the first - order resonant terms from eq .",
    "( [ ham4 ] ) .",
    "optionally , it also accounts for the second - order secular and/or resonant terms .",
    "this code is used to test the approximations * ii * and * iii * listed above    * c. * a code that maps the initial orbital elements onto ( [ fm ] ) and numerically integrates the corresponding eqs .",
    "( [ hameq1 ] ) and ( [ hameq2 ] ) .",
    "another code uses the exact analytic solution ( [ sfmr5 ] ) .",
    "as expected , these two codes give exactly the same result , which shows that our implementation of eq .",
    "( [ sfmr5 ] ) is working correctly .    *",
    "d. * a ttv code based on the analytic formulas derived in section 4 .",
    "this code is subject to all approximations discussed above .",
    "it can not produce accurate results if the orbital eccentricities and/or libration amplitudes exceed certain limits .",
    "we first test the approximation * v*. to this end we compare the results obtained with code * b * with the analytic results from method * d*. in * b * , we include the two first - order resonant terms and neglect terms that are the second or higher order in planetary eccentricities . and [ ttv2 ] in section 2 . ]",
    "the masses and initial orbits are chosen such that @xmath409 ( fig . [ ttv3 ] ) or @xmath410 ( fig . [ ttv4 ] ) .",
    "the initial orbits are then varied to survey different libration amplitudes .",
    "these tests show that the analytic method produces very reliable results for @xmath428 ( top panels in figs .",
    "[ ttv3 ] and [ ttv4 ] ) . for the libration",
    "amplitudes much larger than that , our analytic expressions for @xmath335 and @xmath336 in eq .",
    "( [ uvapp ] ) become inaccurate ( see fig .",
    "[ uvfig ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the analytic approximation of the ttv terms from @xmath17 fails ( bottom panels in figs .",
    "[ ttv3 ] and [ ttv4 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , however , the analytic approximation of the _ full _ ttv signal is reasonable even if @xmath429 .",
    "this happens because the ttv terms from @xmath16 increase with @xmath27 and become dominant for large @xmath27 .",
    "we are able to reproduce these terms correctly , because the analytic formula in eq .",
    "( [ dl ] ) has more a general validity than the one that requires a correct approximation of the boomerang - shaped trajectories in the @xmath430 plane ( eq . [ uvapp ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the analytic ttv model can be used , with some caution , even if the libration amplitudes are relatively large .",
    "we now turn our attention to the approximations * i , ii and iii*. we find that the omission of the higher - order resonant terms in * iii * is the most restrictive assumption . to illustrate this , figures [ ttv7 ] ( inner planet ) and [ ttv8 ] ( outer planet ) show a comparison of the analytic model with ttvs computed from the @xmath427-body code ( method * a * above ) . here",
    "we set different planetary eccentricities ranging from @xmath431 ( left panels in both figures ) to @xmath432 ( right panels ) .",
    "we find that that the analytic model works well for @xmath431 .    already for @xmath433 ,",
    "a significant discrepancy appears ( see middle panels in figs .",
    "[ ttv7 ] and [ ttv8 ] ) .",
    "an important part of the discrepancy , however , is not due to the assumption * iii * , but is rather related to the choice of initial conditions . recall that , in addition to the resonant terms , the exact computation of ttvs with method * a * also contains the short - periodic harmonics , while the analytic method * d * does not account for these terms .",
    "this presents a difficulty when choosing the initial conditions in * a * and * d * that are consistent with each other . if the same values are adopted in * a * and * d * , the initial semimajor axes in * a * generate slightly different values of the mean orbital frequencies than the same initial semimajor axes in * d*. this effect then propagates into a difference in the libration frequency @xmath30 .",
    "to demostrate this , we surveyed a small neigborhood of the initial conditions and found that it is always possible , if the eccentricities are sufficiently small , to apply a small adjustment such that the difference between the analytical and numerical results vanishes ( left and middle bottom panels in figs .",
    "[ ttv7 ] and [ ttv8 ] ) .",
    "note that this initial value problem does not seriously limit the application of the analytic model to the real data , because it requires only a very small adjustment of @xmath89 or @xmath90 ( or equivalently @xmath434 and @xmath435 ) , which can easily be absorbed by other parameters .",
    "another more fundamental discrepancy appears for @xmath432 . in this case , the ttv frequency computed from the analytic model is nearly 40% higher than the actual frequency , and the ttv amplitudes are @xmath26125% smaller than their actual values ( right panels in figs .",
    "[ ttv7 ] and [ ttv8 ] ) . in this case",
    ", it is not possible to adjust the initial conditions to cancel the difference .",
    "this shows that the assumption * iii * starts to fail .",
    "we confirm this by method * b * , where it becomes apparent that including the second - order resonant terms improves model s precision .",
    "still , for @xmath432 the amplitude discrepancy is relatively minor and can be compensated , for example , by a relatively small correction of planetary masses .",
    "we therefore find that the analytic model is still useful in this case .",
    "our additional tests show that the analytic expressions for ttvs are not reliable for eccentricities exceeding @xmath40.1 .",
    "[ the validity domain in @xmath436 should be slightly larger for distant resonances such as 2:1 , and smaller for @xmath437 . ]",
    "the analytic model was developed under the assumption of exactly co - planar planetary orbits .",
    "this assumption was used in section 3.1 to neglect all terms in the laplacian expansion of the perturbing function that depend on inclinations .",
    "the model is therefore not expected to be valid if the mutual inclination between orbits , @xmath438 , is large .",
    "we performed various tests of this assumption and found that the analytic model is reasonably accurate for @xmath439 , but fails to produce reliable results for @xmath440 .",
    "this should not be a severe limitation of the applicability of the analytic results to the multi - transiting planetary systems , because the orbits in these systems are expected to be nearly co - planar ( e.g , fang & margot 2012 ) .",
    "in this work we developed an analytic model for ttvs of a pair of resonant planets , and discussed how the ttv period and amplitude constrain the masses and orbits of the two planets .",
    "the model is strictly valid only for small orbital eccentricities ( @xmath441 ) .",
    "it was developed under the assumption of co - planar orbits but our tests show that it is valid even if the mutual inclination of orbits is not large ( @xmath442 ) .",
    "the resonant ttv signal is expected to contain the harmonics of two basic periods : the period of resonant librations and the period of apsidal precession of orbits .",
    "the latter is expected to be @xmath45 times longer than the former , and may be difficult to detect with a short baseline of the ttv measurements .",
    "the libration period is relatively insensitive to the exact location of the system parameters in the resonant island , and scales with @xmath0 .",
    "its determination from the ttv measurements can therefore help to constrain the planetary masses .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the near - resonant case ( lithwick et al .",
    "2012 ) , where the ttv period is the super period , which is independent of mass .",
    "the ttv amplitudes , on the other hand , can be used to constrain the ratio of planetary masses @xmath67 . since",
    "both the ttv period and amplitude depend on the resonant amplitude @xmath27 , some mild degeneracies between the mass and orbital parameters are expected , but these degeneracies can be broken by a detection of higher - order resonant harmonics , which constrain @xmath27 , and/or short - periodic ( chopping ) effects . a detailed analysis of this problem and the application of our analytic model to the resonant exoplanets ( winn & fabrycky 2015 ) is left for future work .",
