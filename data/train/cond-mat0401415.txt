    "recently , the phenomenon of giant magnetoresistance has attracted considerable interest , not only in the manganites@xcite but also in spinel - type@xcite or intermetallic compounds.@xcite gadolinium diiodide came into the focus of solid - state research because of reports of giant negative magnetoresistance effects at the ferromagnetic phase - transition close to room temperature.@xcite gdi@xmath0 , which contains formally divalent gd with an electronic configuration 4@xmath15@xmath2 , is a correlated narrow @xmath3-band metal revealing ferromagnetism .",
    "gdi@xmath0 has first been synthesized by mee and corbett.@xcite it crystallizes in the close - packed hexagonal 2h - mos@xmath0 structure ( space group @xmath4/mmc ) , which has a strongly two - dimensional ( 2d ) character : the rare - earth layers , in which each gd atom is surrounded by six nearest gd neighbours , are separated by two i atom layers .",
    "the stacking sequence is built up along the c - axis ( see fig .  [ struktur ] ) .",
    "a first study of the magnetic properties was performed by kasten _",
    "_ characterizing gdi@xmath0 as a ferromagnet with a curie temperature near room temperature,@xcite at which the gd moments are aligned perpendicular to the c - axis .    using a semi - phenomenological approach ,",
    "the large magnetoresistance has been explained in terms of a @xmath3-@xmath5 exchange model : the anomalous peak of the resistance and the negative magnetoresistance are due to a strong scattering of the @xmath3-derived conduction electrons by the localized 4@xmath5 electrons.@xcite furthermore , also from its magnetic properties gdi@xmath0 is highly interesting .",
    "gd exhibits a half - filled @xmath6-shell with a spin - only moment of 7 @xmath7 .",
    "any spin - orbit coupling is expected to be weak and in the paramagnetic phase gdi@xmath0 should be a good realization of a 2d - heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "theoretically , a 2d heisenberg ferromagnet is expected to order at 0 k only .",
    "of course , interplane interactions can not be neglected and gdi@xmath0 reveals bulk ferromagnetic order below 290 k with an ordered moment of 7.33 @xmath7 .",
    "the excess moment of 0.33 @xmath7 , when compared to the spin - only moment of the gd 4@xmath5 shell , obviously results from a strong polarization of the 5@xmath3 conduction band.@xcite",
    "gdi@xmath0 has been prepared in a solid - state reaction of gdi@xmath8 and gd metal powder at 1100 k for three weeks in a sealed ta tube jacketed with an evacuated silica ampoule .",
    "details of the sample preparation are given in references and .",
    "the structure has been determined by x - ray powder diffraction and lattice parameters @xmath9 = 0.40775(4 ) nm and @xmath10 = 1.5041(1 ) nm were obtained . for the samples under investigation , from an analysis using modified arrotts plots",
    "the ferromagnetic phase - transition temperature has been determined as @xmath11 = 276 k.@xcite    esr measurements were performed in a bruker elexsys e500 cw - spectrometer at x - band frequencies ( @xmath12 9.47 ghz ) equipped with a continuous n@xmath0-gas - flow cryostat in the temperature region @xmath13 k. note that the samples are very sensitive to exposure to air and humidity",
    ". therefore the whole procedure of powdering the polycrystalline samples and placing them into quartz tubes had to be undertaken in he atmosphere .",
    "then the tubes were sealed in he atmosphere , too .",
    "esr detects the power @xmath14 absorbed by the sample from the transverse magnetic microwave field as a function of the static magnetic field @xmath15 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra is improved by recording the derivative @xmath16 using lock - in technique with field modulation .",
    "esr spectra obtained for gdi@xmath0 in the paramagnetic regime at different temperatures are displayed in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "the spectra consist of a broad , exchange - narrowed resonance line , which is well fitted by a single dysonian line shape.@xcite although an anisotropy of the resonance line can not be excluded due to the two - dimensional character of the system , no such indications can be deduced from the powder spectra in gdi@xmath0 . in general ,",
    "powder spectra exhibit a characteristic pattern due to the random distribution of the orientation of the grains , if resonance field and linewidth are anisotropic.@xcite the fact that the spectra are well described by a single dysonian line indicates that an anisotropy , if existing , is smaller than the observed linewidth . as in the present compound",
    "the linewidth @xmath17 is of the same order of magnitude as the resonance field @xmath18 , both circular components of the exciting linearly polarized microwave field have to be taken into account .",
    "therefore the resonance at the reversed magnetic field @xmath19 has to be included into the fit formula for the esr signal given by @xmath20 this is an asymmetric lorentzian line , which includes both absorption and dispersion , with @xmath21 denoting the dispersion - to - absorption ratio .",
    "such asymmetric line shapes are usually observed in semiconductors@xcite and metals,@xcite where the skin effect drives electric and magnetic microwave components out of phase and therefore leads to an admixture of dispersion into the absorption spectra . for samples small compared to the skin depth one expects a symmetric absorption spectrum ( @xmath22 ) , whereas for samples large compared to the skin depth absorption and dispersion are of equal strength yielding an asymmetric resonance line ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "an additional contribution to the asymmetry of the resonance line can arise from the fact that @xmath17 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath18 , because then not only the overlap with the resonance at @xmath19 but also the mutual coupling via the nondiagonal elements of the dynamic susceptibility influences the lineshape.@xcite as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] the asymmetry of the resonance remains almost constant for higher temperatures , while on approaching magnetic order from above the resonance strongly shifts to lower fields and concomitantly the asymmetry increases significantly due to the increasing overlap with the corresponding resonance at @xmath19 .",

    "the resistance @xmath31 but not the specific resistivity @xmath28 is available at present , the absolute skin depth can not be calculated .",
    "note that the resistance in the paramagnetic regime exhibits a broad maximum,@xcite and , therefore , the changes in the skin depth are negligible , so that one probes always the same fraction of the sample . as we are only interested in relative changes of the spin susceptibility , the use of the above approximation for @xmath24 is justified .",

    "the approximation @xmath24 @xmath25 strictly holds only for @xmath48 but can also be used for larger @xmath17 , if @xmath17 changes only slightly as in our case above 350 k. therefore , the largest uncertainty in @xmath24 certainly occurs where the changes in linewidth are largest .    the resonance field @xmath18 or the effective @xmath49-value @xmath50=@xmath51 provides information about the local static magnetic field at the gd site .",
    "the asymptotic high - temperature value of the resonance field @xmath52 koe corresponds to an effective @xmath50-value of @xmath53 similar to the value observed for gd@xmath54 ions in insulators,@xcite as expected for vanishing orbital moment ( @xmath55 ) of the half - filled 4@xmath5 shell . at about 400 k",
    "the resonance field starts to decrease dramatically towards the ferromagnetic ordering at @xmath56 k.@xcite considering the strong influence of the ferromagnetic fluctuations on the resonance shift on approaching @xmath11 from above and the quite large values of the susceptibility @xmath57 emu / mol for @xmath58 k,@xcite demagnetization effects can not be neglected . due to the relation between intrinsic and observed susceptibility @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the demagnetization factor of the order of 4@xmath61 along the direction of the applied magnetic field ,",

    "this good agreement with the esr intensity and the reported values by eremin and coworkers@xcite corroborates the consistency of our approach .      on decreasing temperatures the resonance broadens and the linewidth exhibits a broad maximum at about 390 k ( see fig .",
    "[ xyzvst](c ) ) . towards lower temperatures",
    "the linewidth decreases and shows a minimum before it abruptly increases again due to inhomogeneous broadening above the ferromagnetic transition . towards the highest temperatures the linewidth seems to reach a constant value at about 1.1 koe .",
    "already at first sight one recognizes that @xmath80 correlates with the temperature dependence of the electrical resistance , both of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ dhvst ] .",
    "it has been proposed that the maximum in @xmath81 results from strong scattering of the @xmath82-derived conduction electrons at the localized @xmath83-electrons due to a peculiar topology of the fermi surface in this compound.@xcite the conduction electrons in gdi@xmath0 occupy a narrow @xmath84 band and the carriers at the fermi level are close to a @xmath85 point of the first brillouin zone . hence , critical ferromagnetic fluctuations influence the magnetic part of the resistivity very strongly .    temperature dependence of the esr linewidth together with the temperature dependence of the resistance for gdi@xmath0 in zero - magnetic field and in an applied field of 1.5 t taken from ref .  .",
    "the contribution @xmath86 has been estimated as described in the text and subtracted from the linewidth data to highlight the contribution of the @xmath3-@xmath5 scattering.,width=321 ]    the esr linewidth @xmath80 generally corresponds to the transverse spin relaxation rate @xmath87 due to local fluctuating fields , which in insulators originate from anisotropic interactions like dipole - dipole interaction between the localized spins , hyperfine fields from the nuclei , and the crystal electric field of the surrounding ligands . in good metals , which contain both localized magnetic moments and delocalized conduction electrons , the interaction between them provides an additional important relaxation channel that usually dominates the broadening mechanism . regarding the resistance values ,",
    "gdi@xmath0 can not be looked upon as a good metal and , hence , we will discuss both line - broadening contributions in the following :    in exchange coupled systems the isotropic heisenberg exchange @xmath88 ( here @xmath89 k ) leads to an exchange narrowing of the esr spectrum into a single line , which is usually described by the kubo - tomita approach,@xcite @xmath90 with the second moment @xmath91 of the resonance line and exchange field @xmath92 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the linewidth in this case is given in the high - temperature approximation by @xmath93 with the free curie susceptibility @xmath94 , where @xmath95 denotes the curie constant of the gd ions with @xmath41 , and the measured @xmath96-susceptibility @xmath97.@xcite as @xmath98 for @xmath99 , the temperature independent parameter @xmath100 can be identified with the high - temperature limit of the esr linewidth . to estimate this contribution to the esr linewidth , we follow the arguments by sperlich _",
    "et al .  _ for the case of gdb@xmath101.@xcite the authors conclude that the main contribution to the resonance linewidth is given by the dipole - dipole interaction of the rare - earth spins contributing about 0.3 koe to the linewidth for gdb@xmath101 , which has an exchange constant of about 1 k. with @xmath102 k in gdi@xmath0 this value is about 50 oe and too small to fully account for the observed high - temperature value of the linewidth .",
    "however , it can not be excluded that the strong two - dimensionality of the system effectively reduces the exchange - narrowing effect resulting in a larger contribution of the dipole - dipole interaction.@xcite    due to very short correlation times @xmath103 in metals , longitudinal @xmath104 and transversal spin relaxation time @xmath105 are equal.@xcite hence , in this case the esr linewidth directly measures the spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath104 . in the case of a half - filled @xmath6-shell with spin @xmath106 the orbital momentum of gd@xmath54 vanishes and a direct relaxation to the lattice is not possible .",
    "nevertheless , the energy is transferred to the lattice by scattering of the conduction electrons at the localized moment of the 4@xmath5 shell .",
    "this is the well - known korringa relaxation which gives rise to a linear increase of the gd linewidth with increasing temperature.@xcite this behaviour is typically observed for gd ions diluted in usual metals and also in many concentrated gd - based transition - metal compounds above magnetic order.@xcite the slope of the linear increase is determined by the electronic density of states at the fermi level @xmath107 .",
    "deviations from this canonical behaviour have already been found from strongly correlated electron systems like heavy - fermion compounds , where the density of states is strongly modified near @xmath108.@xcite in these compounds , both the resistivity and gd - esr linewidth show a typical non - linear temperature dependence with a maximum near the characteristic temperature @xmath109 for the screening of the kondo ions by the conduction electrons .    in gdi@xmath0 we do not have any kondo effect with its antiferromagnetic screening of the localized moments,@xcite but instead there are strong ferromagnetic fluctuations due to the exchange interaction between the gd 5@xmath3 band and the localized 4@xmath5 shell .",
    "like in the case of the kondo effect the electrical resistance is dominated by these fluctuations and vice versa the spin relaxation of the gd 4@xmath5 shell is strongly affected .",
    "therefore the maxima of resistance and linewidth which coincide approximately indicate the characteristic temperature of the ferromagnetic fluctuations in the range @xmath110 k. the curie - weiss temperature @xmath111 was obtained from the high - temperature regime of the susceptibility reported in ref .  .    to accentuate the contribution due to the ferromagnetic spin fluctuations it seems useful to subtract the contribution of the high - temperature relaxation",
    "both possible contributions to the high - temperature linewidth , dipole - dipole interaction following eq .",
    "( [ huber ] ) or a linear korringa increase , if metallic properties dominate , would yield a monotonic increase with increasing temperature .",
    "subtracting such a contribution results , hence , in a more pronounced maximum in agreement with the maximum of the resistance . to illustrate this we assumed a high - temperature value @xmath112 koe corresponding to the linewidth at the highest experimental temperatures and simulated the kubo - tomita contribution eq .",
    "( [ huber ] ) using the susceptibility data from ref .  .",
    "compared to @xmath81 , however , the linewidth maximum is shifted to higher temperatures .",
    "this can be attributed to the finite external magnetic field in the esr experiment , which is swept over a range from 0 to 1.5 t. field - dependent resistance measurements evidence a significant shift of the maximum to higher temperatures with increasing strength of the magnetic field.@xcite from theoretical estimates , it follows that the maximum in @xmath81 shifts by approximately 10 % in external magnetic fields of 1 t,@xcite hence accounting for the observed differences between esr linewidth and resistance .",
    "interestingly , a correlation between the temperature dependence of @xmath80 and @xmath81 has also been observed in the intermetallic compound gd@xmath0pdsi@xmath8.@xcite similar to gdi@xmath0 this compound is characterized by a large magnetoresistance effect and , though showing antiferromagnetic ordering at @xmath113  k , exhibits a positive curie - weiss temperature @xmath114 k evidencing the existence of strong ferromagnetic correlations.@xcite on approaching @xmath115 both resistivity and esr linewidth attain a minimum at @xmath116 , followed by a similar increase of both quantities towards the nel temperature .",
    "it seems likely that this feature could be due to similar scattering processes as in gdi@xmath0 , especially , because the occurrence of anisotropic magnetoresistance effects and anomalies in the hall resistivity strongly suggest the existence of an anisotropic fermi surface and its reconstruction across the metamagnetic anomaly observed in gd@xmath0pdsi@xmath8.@xcite to establish such a scenario , however , a theoretical analysis of the ferromagnetic correlations in gd@xmath0pdsi@xmath8 is highly desirable .",
    "in summary , we find that in gdi@xmath0 the temperature dependence of the esr linewidth correlates with the resistance and conclude that the linewidth is dominated by scattering processes of conduction electrons at the localized @xmath5 electrons .",
    "both the resonance field and the esr intensity can be well described by a phenomenological approach taking into account ferromagnetic spin fluctuations of the @xmath5 electrons . for the resonance field and the esr intensity",
    "the analysis yields in- and out - of - plane exchange constants @xmath117 k and @xmath118 , respectively , which are in excellent agreement with previous estimates .",
