    "most stars form in clustered environments ( @xcite ) . radio and infrared observations have revealed that star clusters form in parsec - scale dense molecular clumps with masses of the order of 10@xmath1 m@xmath0 . in such clumps , stellar feedback from forming stars",
    "shapes their internal structure and affects the formation of next - generation stars .",
    "therefore , understanding the role of stellar feedback in the process of cluster formation is a central problem of star formation study .",
    "there are several types of stellar feedback such as outflows , winds , and radiation ( @xcite , @xcite ) . among them",
    ", some theoretical studies suggest that the radiation pressure from high - mass stars is the most dominant feedback mechanism in the presence of high - mass stars .",
    "however , in the process of high - mass star formation , the outflow feedback from low - mass stars may play a dominant role in regulating star formation before high - mass stars are formed .",
    "in other words , the outflow feedback can control the formation of high - mass stars by injecting momentum and energy in the surrounding gas .",
    "in addition , there are many cluster - forming regions where no high - mass stars form . in such regions ,",
    "outflow feedback should play a dominant role in regulating star formation . in this contribution , we focus on the protostellar outflow feedback and discuss its role on the clump dynamics on the basis of observations .",
    "protostellar outflows have been shown theoretically to be capable of maintaining supersonic turbulence in cluster - forming clumps and keeping the star formation rate per free - fall time as low as a few percent ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , its exact role in clustered star formation remains controversial .",
    "two main scenarios have been proposed for the role of outflow feedback in clustered star formation . in the first scenario ,",
    "the outflow feedback is envisioned to destroy the cluster - forming clump as a whole , which terminates further star formation . in this case",
    ", star formation should be rapid and brief ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the second scenario , the outflow feedback is envisioned to play the role of maintaining the internal turbulent motions . in this scenario ,",
    "star formation should be slow and can last for several free - fall times or longer ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "below we constrain these theoretical models using the observational results of the protostellar outflow feedback .",
    ".nearby cluster - forming clumps .",
    "we note that the clump masses are estimated by @xmath2co data except for serpens south , for which the herschel data are used because of severe absorption of the @xmath2co emission .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     [ tab:3 ]    first , using the observational data of the outflow surveys listed in table [ tab:1 ] , we calculated some physical parameters of the outflow feedback in table [ tab:3 ] .    here , we assumed that outflow gas is optically - thin and that the inclination angles of all the identified outflows are fixed to be the mean value of 57.3 degree .",
    "however , low - velocity wings sometimes become optically thick . therefore , the assumption of the optically - thin leads to underestimation of the outflow mass by a factor of 10 or more . however , we note that we may underestimate momentum and energy only by a factor of a few because the optically - thick gas have low - velocity , and have less momentum and energy than high - velocity components .",
    "[ fig:1 ]      to answer this question , we compare the turbulence dissipation rate ( @xmath3 ) and outflow momentum injection rates ( @xmath4 ) towards target clumps . in previous studies ,",
    "the energy is used for the analysis . however , because the outflow feedback is the momentum feedback ( @xcite ) , we use momentum instead of energy .",
    "the dissipation rate of turbulence is defined as the total cloud momentum divided by turbulence crossing time ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the numerical factor of 0.21 is determined from comparison with turbulence simulations .",
    "the outflow momentum injection rate is defined by the outflow momentum divided by the outflow dynamical time .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the ratio between momentum injection rate and dissipation rate as a function of clump mass .",
    "the momentum injection rates are larger than the dissipation rates for all clumps except ic 348 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the outflow feedback has enough momentum to maintain supersonic turbulence in these clumps .     to the gravitational binding energy of the clump @xmath6 for nearby cluster - forming clumps as a function of clump mass.,width=377 ]    [ fig:2 ]      to answer this question , we adopt the virial theorem , @xmath7 .",
    "first , we list the virial ratios ( @xmath8 ) of the clumps in table [ tab:3 ] .",
    "almost all clumps are close to virial equilibrium within a factor of a few . in figure 2",
    ", we show the ratios of @xmath9 and @xmath6 as a function of clump mass .",
    "figure 2 indicates that for less massive clumps ( b59 , l1551 , l1641n , @xmath10 m@xmath0 ) , the outflow energy is comparable to the gravitational energy .",
    "the dynamics of such clumps may be significantly influenced by the outflow feedback .",
    "on the other hand , for more massive clumps ( @xmath11 200 m@xmath0 ) , the outflow kinetic energy appears to be significantly smaller than the gravitational energy . in other words",
    ", the outflow feedback may not directly destroy the whole clumps .",
    "but , a fraction of gas may be dispersed by outflows .",
    "this gentle ejection of gas may lead to clump dispersal eventually .",
    "from the results presented in the previous section , we found that the outflow feedback can maintain supersonic turbulence in the nearby cluster - forming clumps .",
    "in addition , the outflow kinetic energy is significantly smaller than the clump gravitational energy except for the three least massive clumps , b59 , l1551 , and l1641n . therefore , we conclude that the outflow feedback is not enough to disperse the whole clump at least for the clumps with masses greater than 200 m@xmath0 .",
    "since the majority of stars form in such clumps , we conclude that the observations of the outflow feedback support the slow star formation .",
