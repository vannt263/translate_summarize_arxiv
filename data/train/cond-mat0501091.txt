    "<S> the experimental study of quantized hall effect ( qhe ) has shown that a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) can exhibit zero - resistance states in the vicinity of integral and mostly odd - denominator fractional filling factors , at low temperatures , @xmath4 , and high magnetic fields , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these ( quantum hall ) zero - resistance states are initially approached , at finite @xmath4 , following an activation law , which is understood as a manifestation of a gap in the electronic spectrum.@xcite recent observations of radiation - induced zero - resistance states in the 2des are particularly interesting because they have shown that the above mentioned characteristics , i.e. , activated transport and zero - resistance states , can also be obtained in a photo - excited high mobility 2des , without realizing at the same time a qhe.@xcite in such a situation , one wonders whether the observed characteristics could once again be indicative of a spectral gap , as in the quantum hall limit.@xcite    the zero - resistance states of interest here are induced by microwave excitation of a high mobility gaas / algaas 2des , at low @xmath4 , in a large filling factor limit.@xcite experiments indicate vanishing diagonal resistance , following an activation law , about @xmath5 = ( 4/5)@xmath6 and @xmath5 = ( 4/9)@xmath6 , where @xmath6 = @xmath7 , @xmath8 is an effective mass , @xmath9 is the electron charge , and @xmath10 is the radiation frequency.@xcite in this report , we illustrate transport with resolved landau levels and transmission characteristics , as we refer the reader to the literature for discussions of theory.@xcite    experiments were performed , as indicated elsewhere,@xcite on standard devices fabricated from gaas / algaas heterostructure junctions with an electron mobility up to @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14/vs . </S>",
    "<S> typically , a specimen was mounted inside a waveguide , immersed in pumped liquid helium , and irradiated with electromagnetic ( micro- ) waves over the frequency range @xmath15 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> reported electrical measurements were carried out using low frequency _ ac _ lock - in techniques , as usual .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.25 in    figure 1 shows the low-@xmath5 transport under photoexcitation at 60 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) indicates a wide @xmath16 radiation - induced zero - resistance state about ( 4/5)@xmath6 , and a close approach to vanishing resistance at the next lower-@xmath5 minimum , near ( 4/9)@xmath6 , which follow the series @xmath17)b_{f}$ ] , with @xmath3 = 1,2,3 ... @xcite a remarkable feature in these zero - resistance states is the absence of concomitant plateau formation in the hall effect,@xcite as in typical quantum hall systems.@xcite the @xmath18 data of fig 1(a ) show , for example , that the hall resistance increases linearly vs. the magnetic field and coincides with the @xmath18 that is observed without radiation over the @xmath5 interval corresponding to the ( 4/5)@xmath6 zero - resistance state . yet </S>",
    "<S> , a careful comparison of the photoexcited ( w/ radiation ) hall effect with the dark ( w / o radiation ) hall effect reveals some definite modifications in @xmath18 upon irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at the @xmath16 maxima , there appear to be reductions in the magnitude of the irradiated @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , well above @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath5 @xmath19 0.2 tesla , where @xmath18 exhibits qhe plateaus , a given filling factor qhe appears shifted to higher @xmath5 under the influence of radiation . </S>",
    "<S> these effects could , however , be reversed simply by switching off the microwave excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> = 3.25 in    = 3.25 in    as suggested by fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , radiation - induced zero - resistance states are typically observed over a range of magnetic fields corresponding to weak- or non - existent sdh oscillations ( in the dark ) at easily accessible microwave frequencies and temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> a question that we wish to address is whether radiation - induced zero - resistance states can also occur over the range of @xmath5 where the amplitude of sdh oscillations in the dark is relatively large , say substantially greater than one - half of the _ background _ dc resistance in the absence of microwave excitation , at the same b.    we show here results which indicate that , indeed , these radiation - induced zero - resistance states can also occur in the @xmath5 limit , where giant shubnikov - de haas oscillations are observable in the specimen . </S>",
    "<S> that is , where the landau level spacing , @xmath20 , exceeds both the thermal energy , @xmath21 , and a broadening parameter , @xmath22 , defined from the transport relaxation time i.e. , @xmath23 , which may be viewed as a quantum hall threshold . </S>",
    "<S> this is a regime of consequence because theory has sometimes identified observed effects with the limit where @xmath24.@xcite    fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) shows that the dark specimen exhibits strong sdh oscillations over the range of @xmath25 given by 13 @xmath26 @xmath27}$ ] @xmath26 38 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to filling factors 26 @xmath26 @xmath28 @xmath26 76 because a factor - of - two occurs between @xmath28 and @xmath27}$ ] , i.e. , @xmath28 = 2@xmath27}$ ] , when spin splitting is not resolved in the sdh oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> here , at the examined temperature , @xmath4 = 0.5 k , @xmath29 = 0.676 mev easily exceeds @xmath21 = 0.043 mev . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the broadening parameter indicate that @xmath30.@xcite    photoexcitation of the specimen with @xmath10 = 163.5 ghz radiation initially produces a modulation in the amplitude of the sdh oscillations ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ) , which is the signature of the radiation - induced resistance oscillations in this separated landau level limit . </S>",
    "<S> one might plausibly explain this sdh modulation feature , at least about the radiation induced resistance minima , by suggesting that the radiation reduces the background diagonal resistivity , and that in turn suppresses the amplitude of sdh oscillations . here </S>",
    "<S> , we imagine that the background resistance ( and resistivity ) could be defined ( and extracted ) from the midpoints of the sdh oscillations .    a further increase in the radiation intensity , </S>",
    "<S> see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) , leads to zero - resistance states over broad @xmath25 intervals . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ( 4/5)@xmath6 state occurs here about @xmath31}$ ] = 20 , and it looks similar to the effect that is observed at lower @xmath10 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . note that at ( 4/5)@xmath6 , @xmath32 [ = ( 4/5)@xmath29 ] is noticeably greater than @xmath21 . a remarkable feature in these data of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) is that the sdh oscillations disappear as @xmath16 @xmath34 0 under the influence of radiation . </S>",
    "<S> it appears worth pointing out that we have not observed any evidence of `` chopping '' of the sdh minima on the approach to zero - resistance , as might be expected if the amplitude of the sdh oscillations did not appropriately follow the background @xmath16 , or if the sdh amplitude somehow stayed constant as the background resistivity went to zero under microwave excitation .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth considering the sdh behavior outside of the domain of zero - resistance states . </S>",
    "<S> for example , on either side of the @xmath35 zero - resistance state ( about @xmath27}$ ] = 20 ) , on the adjacent @xmath16 maxima , sdh oscillations continue to be observable , even as they have disappeared on the zero - resistance states themselves . </S>",
    "<S> note that as the background resistance is enhanced with respect to the dark value near , for example , @xmath27}$ ] = 29 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) , the amplitude of the sdh oscillations is not also increased , and this suggests a break in the correlation between the background resistance and the sdh amplitude at the maxima , unlike the case with the minima . </S>",
    "<S> a noteworthy point here seems to be that in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( b ) and ( c ) , the sdh oscillations seem not to increase in amplitude under the influence of microwaves . </S>",
    "<S> the sdh amplitude either stays the same or it is reduced under microwave excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this might indicate a role for electron heating . </S>",
    "<S> parenthetically , there is also some evidence that the threshold radiation intensity for realizing zero - resistance increases , as one moves to higher @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , heating could be more influential at higher excitation frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is attributed here to the point that , as the photon energy increases with @xmath10 , more power needs to be delivered to the specimen in order to maintain a constant photon number per unit of time , which could be the essential underlying parameter , at a higher @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> a subtle feature of interest in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 is that the sdh extrema seem to shift to lower @xmath25 ( or higher @xmath5 ) under microwave excitation , in qualitative agreement with the behavior observed in the hall effect in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a).@xcite    the characteristic field scale for the radiation induced effect , @xmath6,@xcite suggests a possible relation to cyclotron resonance , which one might investigate through simultaneous transmission and transport measurements in the same high mobility specimen , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . here </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(inset ) ) , a resistance sensor placed immediately below the sample served to gauge the relative transmitted power . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) illustrates the specimen @xmath16 vs. @xmath5 , while fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) exhibits the @xmath5-dependent sensor resistance , @xmath36 . in this gaas </S>",
    "<S> / algaas specimen , the optimal radiation induced @xmath16 response occurred in the vicinity of -9 db , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the amplitude of the radiation - induced resistance oscillations increased monotonically with increasing power up to -9 db . </S>",
    "<S> a further increase of the radiation intensity ( db @xmath37 0 ) produced a `` breakdown '' or a reduction in the @xmath16 peak height along with an _ increase _ in the resistance at the minima ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the response of the transmission sensor , @xmath36 , ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) suggests structure at magnetic fields about- and mostly above- @xmath6 , which becomes more pronounced with increased excitation . </S>",
    "<S> the feature correlates with a strong radiation - induced distortion of the @xmath16 peak that is centered about 0.3 tesla . </S>",
    "<S> one might interpret some of these features about @xmath6 as a signature of cyclotron resonance , although further supplementary evidence appears necessary to confirm this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the observed oscillations in @xmath16 below @xmath6 appear imperceptible in the sensor response ( cf . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ) .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have emphasized the possibility of realizing radiation induced zero - resistance states , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , in a range of @xmath5 where @xmath16 exhibits giant sdh oscillations due to separated landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> this result indicates that radiation - induced zero - resistance states occur even outside a so - called quasi - classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> transmission measurements also indicate non - monotonic features in the transmitted signal about and above @xmath6 , some of which could be indicative of cyclotron resonance .    </S>",
