    "the interaction between interstellar clouds and shock waves associated with for example supernova remnants , h ii regions or stellar winds has been studied as one of the most fundamental problem of interstellar gas dynamics .",
    "shock - molecular cloud ( mc ) interaction is especially important as a process that dynamically drives star formation .",
    "studies using hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics simulations revealed that strong interstellar shock wave injected into the molecular cloud crush and destroy it through shock injection and ensuing hydrodynamical instabilities such as kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) , rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and richtmyer - meshkov ( rm ) instabilities , although inclusion of magnetic field strongly suppress those instabilities @xcite .",
    "magnetic field orientation and mass density structure within clouds also affects significantly the later phase of the dynamics of molecular cloud impacted by shock wave @xcite .",
    "recent observations and numerical simulations reveal multi - phase multi - scale dynamics of filamentary clouds - shock interaction within a cloud is important for the evolution of star forming molecular clouds with the help of thermal or self gravitational instabilities @xcite .    on the other hand , shock waves",
    "are frequently observed in the corona of the sun @xcite . in the corona ,",
    "magnetic field reconnection allows magnetic field energy released in a catastrophic way resulting in largest explosion in the solar system .",
    "this is called solar flares . during solar flares ,",
    "typically @xmath0 - @xmath1ergs of magnetic field energy stored in the corona is converted to thermal , kinetic , radiation and high energy particle kinetic energy in a short ( several minutes ) time scale @xcite .    as a result of sudden energy release in solar flares ,",
    "a part of energy propagate globally in the corona as a form of non linear fast mode mhd wave ( or shock ) .",
    "recently , high cadence extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) observation of the solar corona by atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) on board solar dynamics observatory ( _ sdo _ ; pesnell et al .",
    "2012 ) allows detailed imaging observation of such global shock waves in the corona @xcite .",
    "these flare associated shock waves in the lower solar corona are thought to be weak fast mode mhd shocks @xcite .",
    "plasma ejections ( coronal mass ejections , cmes ) associated with solar flares propagate in the interplanetary space , sometimes with clear shock fronts at their noses @xcite .",
    "these propagating shockwaves in the upper corona or interplanetary space are observed in coronagraph images or in radio dynamic spectrum observations @xcite .",
    "they are also observed as a sudden change in plasma parameters of solar wind velocity , temperature , density and magnetic field strength observed in - situ in front of the earth @xcite .",
    "we also have clouds in the solar corona , the prominences. they are cool and dense plasma floating within hot and rarefied corona .",

    "non - linear mhd waves propagating upward around prominence foot is studied by @xcite . the magnetic rayleigh - taylor instability invoked by interchange reconnection between magnetic field lines supporting prominence plasmas",
    "is discussed as an excitation mechanism for multiple plume - like upflows observed with _ hinode_/sot which help mix up prominence plasmas @xcite .",
    "magnetic kelvin - helmholtz instability excited near the absorption layer of transversely oscillating prominence in the corona helps cascade energy and heat the prominence plasma through turbulence excitation and current sheet formation @xcite .    sometimes , coronal shock waves associated with flares hit solar prominences and lead to excitement of large amplitude prominence oscillations .",
    "these oscillations give us information of physical properties of prominences such as magnetic field strength , density , and eruptive stability and have been studied widely @xcite .",
    "in contrast to interstellar shock - molecular cloud interaction that has been studied widely , the excitation process of large amplitude solar prominences or prominence activations by coronal shock injection has not been studied in detail in the context of shock - cloud interaction .",
    "in contrast to the situation in interstellar medium where strong shock wave often interact with molecular clouds , the prominence activation is the interaction between prominence and weak fast mode mhd shock wave with fast mode mach number being between 1.1 and 1.5 @xcite .",
    "the time scale of shock - prominence interaction is several minutes , which offers us unique opportunity to study in detail the time evolution of shock - cloud interaction process in cosmic plasmas .    in this paper",

    "especially , we focus quantitatively on how wave momentum is transferred to cloud material through shock injection , flow drag and magnetic tension acceleration processes with 3d mhd simulation .",
    "we also discuss the effect of internal structure such as volume filling factor on chaotic flow excitation and its damping .",
    "we compare the mhd simulation results with hydrodynamic simulation and discuss the role of magnetic field in bulk prominence acceleration as well as excitement and damping of internal flows .",

    "it seems strange that the estimated speed of the leading shock front ahead of the cme is much slower than the cme speed estimated with _",
    "we looked at the coronagraph observation data by _ stereo - b_/cor1 and radio dynamic spectrum once again to check the consistency .",
    "the hight of the leading edge of the cme ejecta seen in _ stereo - b_/cor1 image taken at 00:26ut is larger than 2 @xmath5 measured from the photosphere , where @xmath5 is the solar radius . on the other hand ,",
    "the radio dynamic spectrum during the flare period is complicated and composed of type ii , type iv and possibly type iii bursts .",

    "the footprints of the dome - like shock front which propagated to the north in the lower corona was especially bright in aia 193 @xmath3 images .",

    "the polar prominence was seen bright in aia 304 @xmath3 images while it was seen dark in aia 193 images .",
    "figure 3 ( a ) and ( b ) show the prominence just before it is activated by the shock .",
    "figure 3 ( c ) and ( d ) show the prominence just hit by the coronal shock front .",
    "the shocked part of the prominence seen in aia 304  image became about twice as bright as its original brightness .",
    "the bright part propagated in the direction of shock propagation and at the same time the prominence started to move in the shock propagation direction .",

    "when the coronal shock front reached the dark prominence , the prominence was abruptly accelerated .",
    "the initial activated prominence speed was 48  km  s  @xmath4 measured from figure 3 ( i ) .",
    "we can clearly see the sudden brightening of the prominence during its activation in figure 3 ( j ) . in figure 3 ( j ) , we can see somewhat chaotic movement of prominence threads during lapo .",
    "we note here that we have neglected the line - of - sight component of the speed of shock propagation and activated prominence , so the estimated shock speed and prominence velocity should be regarded as lower limits .",
    "figure 3 ( g ) and ( h ) show the prominence when its displacement from the original position was largest .",
    "note that the time scale of prominence activation is several minutes in this event while the period of lapo is longer than an hour .",

    "we modeled the prominence as a sphere of plasma in stead of a cylindrical plasma in this paper in order to also study the effect of magnetic tension force induced by shock injection which is revealed to be important in prominence activation as discussed in section 3.4 .",
    "when the time scale of prominence activation is much smaller than that of lapo ( as in the case of the event discussed in section 2 ) , the global magnetic field structure will not play a significant role on the dynamics of prominence activation process . in that case",
    "we can separate the physics that govern prominence activation with that govern the ensued lapo . in order to focus only on the physics of prominence activation ,",
    "we think of such a situation in this study .",

    "both total surface area of clumps and local density gap between clump and corona in runs @xmath33 are larger than those in runs @xmath34 .",

    "a possible reason for the discrepancy of the damping times among the components is as follows .",
    "when the randomized flow is directed to positive x - direction at a certain time and location , the magnetic field lines originally directed to z - direction ( @xmath284 ) will be distorted there in xz plane resulting in the electric current directed in negative y - direction ( -@xmath285 ) .",

    "the same damping mechanism works on the y - component of velocity dispersion as well , but not on z - component .",
    "in interplanetary shock - cloud interaction , both shock sweeping mechanism and fluid drag force accelerate the cloud .",
    "khi is also important in mixing mc materials which will affect star formation process taking place . in solar coronal shock - prominence interaction ,",
    "magnetic tension force is more important in accelerating the prominence than fluid drag force , because in prominence activation , plasma beta is typically smaller than unity and the shock not strong .",
    "when the prominence has internal density structure like in runs @xmath33 , plasma mixing might also occur in short time scale .",
    "when the plasma beta is much larger than unity ( which is a reasonable assumption in some molecular clouds ) , the cloud acceleration and internal flow excitation shows much different characteristics .",
    "the shock - sweeping acceleration mechanism is effective only during the shock passage time @xmath287 , and the pressure gradient force due to the velocity difference between the cloud and the ambient plasma works as an accelerator .",
    "the cloud is flattened with the help of ambient flow that converge towards the cloud along x - axis and diverges in yz plane associated with a coherent vortex formed behind the cloud .",
    "the flattening effect increases the effective cross section of the cloud , helping the cloud acceleration by fluid drag",
    ". the excited internal flow does not decay in hydrodynamic simulation run @xmath150 , though in mhd simulation runs @xmath85 , the internal flow damps in an exponential manner mainly due to the lorentz force .    in reality , the coronal shock wave that activate a prominence is not a blast wave as studied in runs @xmath34 or @xmath33 but a wave packet with finite wave packet width .",

    "the shocked prominence is first accelerated and then decelerated by magnetic tension and total pressure gradient force in the simulation run @xmath201 .",
    "the phenomenological model @xmath201 well captures the characteristic dynamics of the prominence center of mass both in acceleration and deceleration phases , but slightly underestimate the impact of pressure gradient force . especially , the phenomenological model @xmath201 does not reproduce the prominence deceleration by total pressure gradient force which is present in run @xmath201 .",
    "one of the possible reason for the discrepancy is that the phenomenological model neglects the effect of multiple reflection of transmitted shock wave within the prominence .",

    "both the estimated coronal shock propagation speed and the plasma velocity amplitude of @xmath289 km s@xmath4 and @xmath290 km s@xmath4 are reasonable values as a weak fast mode coronal shock wave .",
    "the shock wave that activated the prominence had likely been driven by the lateral expansion of cme ejecta in the lower corona ( whose speed is much smaller than the radial ejection speed ) and had propagated a considerable distance of @xmath291 from the source active region .",
