    "different hypotheses for the structural model of pmt were tested during the refinement procedure . as in bmt , the cubic perovskite structure ( space group pm@xmath23",
    "m ) was assumed as a starting model . in this model , the refined values of the isotropic thermal parameters for lead and oxygen",
    "were found to be very high with b@xmath30 and b@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "these values are much higher then those found for b@xmath32 , and for the isotropic temperature factors in the reference compound bmt . in particular , the large value of @xmath33 is anomalous and indicates a possible structural disorder .",

    "pb was never found to be located exactly at the 1@xmath24 ( 0  0  0 ) wyckoff position .",
    "thus , to improve our structural model , both displacements of pb from the 1@xmath24 ( 0  0  0 ) special wyckoff position and anisotropic temperature factors for oxygen ions were introduced .",
    "we considered the shifts of pb along the @xmath11001@xmath35 , @xmath11110@xmath35 , and @xmath11111@xmath35 directions .        at 588",

    "reliability factors for pb - shifts along the @xmath11001@xmath35 direction are significantly worse than the corresponding value for the @xmath11110@xmath35 and @xmath11111@xmath35 directions . for the latter two directions ,",
    "the quality of fit is nearly the same at all temperatures . displacing pb along @xmath11110@xmath35",
    "always gives a slightly better reliability factor and minimizes the value of the isotropic temperature factor of pb .",
    "however , we do not put a strict physical sense in the choice of this particular direction for pb - shifts .",
    "namely , as was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a preferable direction of the pb - shifts can be artificial because of insufficiently high values in @xmath37 ( note that we reached @xmath38 ) . to our opinion , the quality of refinement for the different displacement directions depends on the associated degeneracies : six - fold for the @xmath11001@xmath35 , eight - fold for @xmath11111@xmath35 and twelve - fold for @xmath11110@xmath35 .",
    "the latter direction of shifts gives the closest approximation of a sphere .",
    "hence , we used the @xmath11110@xmath35 direction to refine the data taken at other temperatures . to improve the structural model",
    "further , we introduced shifts for mg / ta ions and non - stoichiometric values for pb and o content .",
    "however , the fit procedure converged to the nominal stoichiometric ratio .",
    "the introduction of shifts for mg / ta , while keeping all other parameters fixed , did not allow us to improve the structural model noticeably .",

    "the structural parameters obtained from the powder refinement at t=588  k are given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "we observe that on the contrary to bmt , the thermal ellipsoid for oxygen is anisotropic ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "we note also that despite introduction of displacements , the isotropic temperature factor for pb is still quite important ( see table  [ table1 ] ) , being 2.5 times larger than b@xmath40(mg / ta ) and 2 times larger than b@xmath40(ba ) in bmt .    lllll direction & value ( @xmath41 & u@xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) & r@xmath36 & @xmath44 + @xmath11001@xmath35 & 0.27(0.05 ) & 1.98(7 ) & 3.76 & 3.63 + @xmath11110@xmath35 & 0.20(0.03 ) & 1.51(6 ) & 3.28 & 3.44 + @xmath11111@xmath35 & 0.16(0.04 ) & 1.68(6 ) & 3.35 & 3.47 +    lll parameters &   & values + a (  ) &   & 4.05103(8 ) + pb shift (  ) &   & 0.20(0.03 ) + pb u@xmath40 ( @xmath43 ) &   & 1.51(6 ) + mg / ta u@xmath40 ( @xmath43 ) &   & 0.66(1 ) + o @xmath45( ) = @xmath46( ) &   & 0.0340(3 ) + o @xmath47( ) &   & 0.0101(4 ) + @xmath44 &   & 3.44 + r@xmath48 &   & 2.88 + r@xmath49 &   & 3.74 +      in the following ,",

    "already in the earliest studies of pmn by x - rays  @xcite and neutron  @xcite diffraction , diffuse scattering was found , the intensity of which grows as the temperature decreases  @xcite .",
    "moreover , at low temperatures , ds is so strong that it becomes observable even in powder diffraction patterns  @xcite .",
    "later work on pmn single crystals showed that the distribution of diffuse scattering is anisotropic in reciprocal space  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the distribution of ds intensity in a single crystal of pmt at t  =  140  k in the vicinity of the ( 1  1  0 ) and ( 0  0  1 ) bragg positions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the ds measured in the vicinity of ( 1  1  0 ) bragg peak of pmt has a `` butterfly '' shape in reciprocal space similar to the ds observed in single crystals of pmn  @xcite .",
    "note , that the intensity of ds is mainly concentrated along the equatorial section transverse to the @xmath11110@xmath35 direction .",
    "measurements in pmt around the ( 0  0  1 ) bragg peak give a very similar shape of ds . in that case , the most intense part of diffuse scattering is concentrated along the equatorial section transverse to the @xmath11001@xmath35 direction . it is obvious that the q- dependence of ds in pmt is complicated and to incorporate properly the ds into the structural model for powder refinement is an extremely difficult problem . hence , the ds occurring in the powder diffraction pattern was treated as background .",
    "180 k. invar - like behaviour of pmt for @xmath50 is obvious.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ fig4 ] shows that the temperatures dependences of the lattice parameters for bmt and pmt are qualitatively different . starting from high temperature , the lattice parameter of bmt decreases almost linearly as the temperature decreases down to @xmath51 .",
    "there is a cross - over regime between this temperature and @xmath52 , below which the lattice parameter of bmt is approximately constant .",
    "the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter of bmt can be described by a quadratic polynom @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "similar temperature dependences are commonly observed in solids ( see for instance  @xcite and references therein ) and do not contain any signature of anomalies .",
    "this simply reflects that in a broad temperature range ( 1.5  k    730  k ) , the lattice of bmt continuously expands .",
    "hence , it appears that the presence of chemical disorder on the b - sublattice does not affect significantly the thermal expansion of the bmt lattice .",
    "the variation of the lattice parameters of pmt can be separated into three distinct temperature regimes . as in bmt , the lattice parameter decreases linearly from high temperatures ( @xmath57 ) with a cross - over regime between t=420  k and t@xmath6180  k. below this temperature , the lattice does not contract any more ( @xmath58 ) . on the contrary to what is observed for bmt",
    ", a quadratic polynom does not reproduce the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and it is necessary to include powers up to 6 to describe the temperature dependence of the lattice parameter of pmt .",
    "it is clear that such a behaviour is anomalous .",
    "we remind the reader that the peak in the dielectric susceptibility of pmt appears around t@xmath6180  k  @xcite .",
    "thus , the dielectric anomaly and the invar - like property in pmt are observed at the same temperature ( see insert of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the description of the temperature dependence of the amplitude of pb displacements ( pb@xmath59 ) and of the ds intensity in pmt shown in fig .",
    "we measured the temperature dependence of the ds in pmt single crystal along [ 1,1,q ] . in that direction",
    ", we find that the line - shape can be reproduced using a lorentzian function  @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the integrated intensity , @xmath62 is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , and @xmath63 determines the center of the lorentzian . note that this approximation was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to analyze the intensity of ds in pmn .",
    "we monitored the evolution of ds in pmt in the temperature range 1.5  k    375  k. at higher temperatures ,",
    "the ds is extremely weak in intensity and broad in q - space , and the results obtained above @xmath64 can not be analyzed reliably .    )",
    "( open symbols ) in pmt.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure  [ fig5 ] shows the temperature behaviour of the integrated intensity of ds and of the refined values of the pb@xmath59 shifts in the temperature range @xmath65 .",
    "note that the values of the pb@xmath59 were derived from intensities of the bragg peaks in the powder diffraction patterns whereas ds was extracted from the broad intensity distribution around these bragg peaks _ i.e. _ from short - range correlations .",
    "the correlation length extracted from the fwhm of the ds line shape is found to increase continuously with decreasing temperature and was published previously  @xcite .",
    "there is a pronounced similarity between the increase of ds intensity and the displacement amplitude of pb@xmath59 as the temperature decreases . in the temperature range @xmath66 both quantities",
    "are constant within statistical errors and decrease monotonously as the temperature is further increased .",
    "finally , they tend to saturate above @xmath67 although a very slow decrease of pb@xmath59 above 412  k is not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for better comparison with the ds intensity .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig5 ] strongly suggest that lead displacements may be responsible for the occurrence of ds in pmt .",
    "there is however no linear relationship between the temperature dependence of pb@xmath59 and ds : while the ds intensity decreases by a factor of @xmath68 when the temperature increases from 1.5  k to 375  k , the change in pb@xmath59 is of the order of @xmath620% only . at higher temperatures , lead displacements are still important",
    ", the ds is broad in q - space , since the correlation length is short  @xcite . in other words , while pb displacements are _ nearly uncorrelated _ or _ uncorrelated _ the ds is weak ( or totally absent ) . with decreasing temperature the pb displacements increase and",
    "become _ correlated _ , which causes the appearance of the ds .",
    "note also , that one can not claim that only pb displacements are responsible for ds .",
    "however , it was possible to satisfactorily fit the diffraction patterns of pmt assuming that only lead ions are displaced .",
    "this suggests that the main contribution to the ds in relaxor crystals originates from pb ions .",
    "the recent observation of a temperature - dependent relaxation mode , coexisting with the central peak in pmn crystal  @xcite , also supports this hypothesis .",
    "we discuss now the resemblance observed for the temperature dependence of ds intensity and for pb@xmath59 .",
    "it seems that the q - dependence of ds in all relaxors , which have been studied so far , is very similar .",
    "for example , ds with a `` butterfly - like '' shape is observed in pmn  @xcite and in pzn+8%pbtio@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the intensity of ds is found to increase with decreasing temperature in pmn  @xcite and pzn  @xcite , as here for pmt . from neutron and x - ray diffraction data ,",
    "it is known that there is a general tendency that pb displacements increase as the temperature decreases in complex perovskites ( see _ e.g. _",
    ". one can expect that the observed correlation between the ds intensity and the amplitudes of pb displacements in pmt may help to create a model which describes short - range order in relaxors . in that vein ,",
    "the calculations of kassan - ogly and naish predicting an increase of diffuse scattering with decreasing temperature due to change in ionic - oscillation amplitudes may be considered as a useful starting point  @xcite .",
    "high - resolution neutron diffraction allowed us to study the temperature dependence of the lattice constant @xmath24 in pmt from 41 unique bragg reflections in the temperature range @xmath69 with temperature step of @xmath70 .",
    "we found changes of slope in @xmath71 at @xmath72 and @xmath73 which do not strictly agree with previous temperature studies of the lattice parameters in pmt . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an anomaly was observed first at t=573  k and the lattice parameters were found to remain constant below t=280  k. we ascribe the discrepancy between our data and those by lu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite to the facts that , first , the latter measurements were carried out using three bragg peaks of low miller indices and , second , the number of temperature points was much reduced as compared to the present study .",
    "thus , to our opinion there is no anomaly in the lattice parameter of pmt which could be directly connected with the burns temperature @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the change of slope of @xmath71 in pmt at high temperatures occurs at temperatures where we are able first to observe the diffuse scattering . in other words ,",
    "deviation from linear law in @xmath71 of pmt crystal appears when the shifts of pb ions become correlated .",
    "note , that the so - called `` excess '' specific heat in pmt also appears at @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to compare the behaviour of the lattice parameters of pmt and pmn  @xcite in the temperature ranges where dielectric anomalies are observed . in the first neutron measurements by husson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , the lattice parameter of pmn was observed to remain roughly constant below @xmath76 .",
    "however , recent studies have revealed a more complicated behaviour of @xmath71 in pmn . in refs .",
    "@xcite a change of slope in @xmath71 was found at @xmath77 and at @xmath78 . in the temperature range 200    350  k , dkhil _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported a freezing of the lattice parameters , similar to what we found in pmt below @xmath79 .",
    "an important qualitative difference in the behaviors of the lattice parameters of pmn and pmt is that below @xmath51 , @xmath71 for pmn decreases again as the temperature is lowered , whereas for pmt such a change of regime is absent .",
    "we remind that at t@xmath8  k pmn has an additional phase transition in an applied electric field  @xcite . however , even without application of an external electric field , properties like damping of longitudinal acoustic phonons  @xcite , and the width of quasielastic component in light scattering spectra  @xcite exhibit anomalies in pmn in the vicinity of this temperature .",
    "thus , it is possible that this lattice instability is linked with the additional change of @xmath71 of pmn as the temperature decreases below 200  k.    in the following we discuss possible causes for the anomalous temperature dependence of the lattice parameter in pmt . as it is well - known",
    "( see for instance  @xcite ) , the unit cell volume @xmath80 depends on temperature @xmath81 as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the isothermal compressibility , @xmath84 the grneisen function , and @xmath85 the heat capacity taken at constant volume .",
    "however , it is not easy to understand the low - temperature saturation of @xmath71 below the temperature of the maximum in @xmath5 .",
    "the problem is related to the large number of observed anomalies in the vibration spectra of pmt ( as well as in other relaxors ) for temperatures close to the dielectric maximum , like    * increase in the generalized density of states at low energies  @xcite , * anomalies in the behaviour of the longitudinal acoustic phonons  @xcite , * excess contribution to the specific heat  @xcite .",
    "hence , to estimate the influence of each of this anomalies on the behaviour of @xmath71 using _ e.g. _ eq .  ( [ termodynamics ] ) is an extremely complicated problem .",
    "we note only that an invar - like behaviour generally can be described e.g by compensation of anharmonic behaviour of different phonon modes  @xcite or striction .",
    "the electrostriction mechanism originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite can also give some contribution in the behaviour of @xmath71 . since @xmath71 is linear totemperatures well below @xmath86",
    ", it is unlikely that electrostriction is the only mechanism responsible for the temperature evolution of the lattice parameters in pmt .",
    "to summarize , an extensive neutron study has been carried out in pmt and bmt complex perovskites in the temperature range 1.5  k ",
    "730  k. the surface of diffuse scattering in a pmt single - crystal has been measured at t  =  140  k. crystal structure parameters have been refined for both compounds .",
    "we found that lead ions are shifted from the 1@xmath24 ( 0  0  0 ) wyckoff position of the ideal perovskite structure and that the thermal motion parameter of oxygen is anisotropic in pmt .",
    "the lattice parameter of bmt does not exhibit any anomalous behaviour . on the other hand ,",
    "the lattice parameter of pmt shows two anomalies .",
    "one of them appears around t  = 420  k which corresponds to the appearance of diffuse scattering and of the excess specific heat in pmt .",
    "the second anomaly is found close to the maximum of the dielectric susceptibility at t=180  k. an obvious correlation in the behaviour of the lead displacements and of the neutron diffuse scattering intensity is observed in pmt .",
    "this indicates that lead displacements play a major rle in the occurrence of diffuse scattering in pmt and probably also in other relaxor ferroelectrics .",
