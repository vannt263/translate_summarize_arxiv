    "magnetic fields determine an activity of tts and play a crucial role in an evolution of angular momentum of these objects , therefore a question about strength and topology of the magnetic field is one of the fundamental questions of physics of young stars .",
    "magnetic field was found in @xmath15 ttss at the moment , and for some of them an information about its structure has been retrieved ",
    "see donati & landstreet ( 2009 ) and references therein .",
    "rw aur was included in the original list of t tauri stars compiled by joy ( 1945 ) .",
    "the year before joy and van biesbroeck ( 1944 ) have discovered that the star ( rw aur a ) has a companion ( rw aur b ) at the distance @xmath16 .",
    "it was found later that both components are so - called classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) , whose activity is due to accretion of matter from protoplanetary disc ( bertout , 1989 ) .",
    "recently images of the discs were obtained for both components of the system in the submillimeter region ( cabrit et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "contribution of the secondary to the overall optical flux does not exceed a few percent ( petrov et al . , 2001 )",
    ", therefore it can be assumed that features of optical spectra described below belong to the primary .",
    "optical spectra of rw aur were investigated by many researches  see petrov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; alencar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ; petrov & kozack ( 2007 ) and references therein .",
    "it was found that the spectrum has a multicomponent structure which includes :    \\1 ) a photospheric absorption k1-k4 spectrum superimposed with emission continuum and narrow absorption lines with radial velocities close to that of photospheric lines ;    \\2 ) absorption components in red wings of some lines that indicate gas inflow onto the star with velocity up to 400 kms@xmath12 ;    \\3 ) absorption components at blue wings of some lines , which indicate a gas outflow from stellar vicinity with a velocity greater than 200 kms@xmath12 .",
    "the outflowing gas is collimated into two jets with an opposite orientation at large distances from the star ( hirth et al .",
    ". lines of [ oi ] and [ sii ] are originated in these jets ;    \\4 ) emission lines of different elements which are ( in a differnt degree ) superposition of a broad ( fwhm@xmath17 kms@xmath12 ) and narrow ( fwhm @xmath18 kms@xmath12 ) components .",
    "the components are most likely formed in different regions .",
    "petrov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have found periodic variations of radial velocities of photospheric lines with an amplitude about 6 kms@xmath12 and a period @xmath19 days .",

    "velocities @xmath23 and @xmath20 vary in antiphase and phase curves of @xmath21 and @xmath24 are shifted relative to the curve @xmath23 to one fourth of the period .",
    "similar behaviour of the narrow components and absorptions at the red wing is also observed for some other lines . what about broad components of emission lines it turned out that they vary with a period of about 5.5 days , i.e. twice slower than @xmath25    these features of rw aur spectrum",
    "can be explained by a model of non - axisymmetric magnetospheric accretion .",
    "petrov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have considered two possible reasons for a violation of an axisymmetry .",
    "the first reason is an existence of low - mass companion with an orbital period of 2.77 days .",
    "it was assumed that an interaction of the companion and the disc results in a fall of disc matter towards rw aur a in a form of stream , which rotates together with the satellite around the central star .",
    "an alternative hypothesis assumes that rw aur a is a single star with a period of axial rotation @xmath26 days and a magnetic axis is tilted relative to a rotational axis . if stellar magnetic field is not too much differ from a dipole field then gas accreting from the disc forms two streams , falling onto opposite hemispheres of the star ( romanova et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "so - called hot spots arises at the footstep of the streams such as both spots should be visible in the case of rw aur a what can explain why variations of photospheric and emission lines parameters occur with a period twice smaller than rotational one .",
    "magnetic field measurements allow to choose between these hypotheses because in the case of a single star magnetic field in hotspots should changes its sign to opposite after a half of the period .",
    "the only attempt to measure magnetic field in rw aur was made by symington et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who observed the star three times : december,5 2001 , december , 21 and 23 2002 .",
    "but results of these measurements even averaged over night have low precision ( @xmath27 kg , @xmath28 kg , @xmath29 kg correspondingly ) and can not be used to choose between the models of a single and a binary star .",
    "new results of measurements of magnetic field longitudinal component in rw aur a are presented here .",
    "we succeded to confirm the model of two hotspots with opposite magnetic field polarities and to found strong magnetic field ( up to @xmath30 kg ) in rw aur a s outflow .",
    "the method we use to measure magnetic field is based on the fact that so - called @xmath31-components resulted in zeeman splitting are polarized circularly such as oppositely polarized components are located on different sides of the central wavelength @xmath32 . if magnetic field in a line formation region has a longitudinal component @xmath0 then the right- and left - hand polarized components will be shifted relative to each other to @xmath33 where g is the lande g - factor of the line under consideration , @xmath34 @xmath32 are in  and @xmath0 is in kg .",
    "this relation allows to found the longitudinal magnetic field component averaged over the line formation region by measuring @xmath35 from two spectra observed in the right- and left - hand polarized light .",
    "our observations were carried out in january - february 2006 , december 2007 , january 2008 and january 2009 with the main stellar spectrograph ( panchuk , 2001 ) of 6-m telescope of special astrophysical observatory equipped with a polarization @xmath36-plate and a double slicer ( chountonov , 2004 ) .",
    "18 spectra of rw aur have been observed .",
    "the spectrograph slit width @xmath37 provided a spectral resolution of @xmath38 in @xmath39  spectral band .",
    "spectra were processed as follows ( chountonov et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "dark current , night sky emission and detector bias as well as cosmic ray traces were removed in a standard way , using routines from the midas software package . a spectrum of a thorium - argon lamp was used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the spectra are transformed into the stellar rest frame , i.e. the earth radial velocity and the average radial velocity of rw aur ( @xmath40 kms@xmath12 ) were subtracted .",
    "hereafter all velocities of spectral features will be specified in the stellar rest frame .    each observed spectrum covered a range @xmath41 about 360  .",
    "the center of spectra was near hei 5876 or nai d lines in 11 cases and shifted to the red on a few hundred  in other 7 spectra",
    ". we will refer to these spectra as `` blue '' and `` red '' respectively .",
    "the log of observations is presented in table [ tab - zhurnal ] .    to measure the difference between line positions in the spectra with opposite polarizations we used a version of the crosscorrelation method ( johnstone & penston , 1986 ) for the confidence level @xmath42 what corresponds to 1@xmath31 error . to exclude systematic instrumental errors our observations",
    "were organized as follows .    between exposures",
    "the superachromatic quarter - wave phase plate was rotated in such a way that the right- and left - hand polarized spectra on the ccd array changed places .",
    "let @xmath43 be the difference between the positions of a certain line in the spectra with opposite polarizations measured at the initial position of the phase plate and @xmath43 be the same quantity measured after the plate s rotation .",
    "then the difference @xmath44 is free from systematic errors the main of which is spectrograph s slit tilt .",
    "thus two exposures of the star are required to measure the line shift .",

    "@xmath0 upper limits in the photosphere and in the [ oi ] 6300 line formation region ( after averaging over all measurements at @xmath7-level ) are 180 g and 230 g correspondingly .",
    "fei and feii emission lines have similar profiles and consist solely of the broad component . therefore using these lines we measure the field in a region where the broad component is formed .",
    "as far as shapes and equivalent widths of the broad components are variable ( petrov et al . , 2001 )",
    "there is no sence to average the field over time .",
    "depending on the night , upper limits ( at @xmath7-level ) for feii lines lie between 300 and 600 g ",

    "magnetic field was detected in hei 5876 line formation region .",
    "the field has a different sign in different moments  see fig .",
    "[ he - i - v - profs ] on which spectrum of a veiled photosphere was subtracted from stokes @xmath52-profile .    for illustrative purposes we computed model @xmath47-profiles .",
    "after the field and corresponding shift @xmath53 between right- and left polarized profiles had been derived , we computed the difference between two @xmath52-profiles , the first of them was shifted by @xmath54 to the left and the second was shifted by the same amount to the right .",
    "having divided the difference by @xmath55 , we simulated a model @xmath47-profile .",
    "it can be seen that in an emission part of the @xmath52-profile the model @xmath47-profile well approximates observed one and clearly indicates that the field in observations presented on the left and right panels of fig.[he - i - v - profs ] has the opposite sign .",

    "[ na - i - v - profs ] .",
    "model @xmath47-profile for nai d lines was computed in the same manner as for hei 5876  line .    in the conclusion of this section",
    "note the following .",
    "it can be found from table 1 of petrov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) paper that rw aur s radial velocity of photospheric lines averaged over all obsrvations with @xmath58 weight is equal to @xmath59 kms@xmath12 .",
    "the same quantity derived from our observations is equal to @xmath40 kms@xmath12 .",
    "possible reasons of the discrepancy will be discussed in the conclusion .",
    "as was noted in the introduction some lines in rw aur s spectrum have redshifted absorption feature extended up to the velocity @xmath60 kms@xmath12 ( see e.g. the left panel of fig.[he - i - v - profs ] ) indicating matter infall with the same velocity .",
    "accreted gas should be deccelerated near stellar surface in the shock and abruptly heated up at the shock front to @xmath61 post shock zone is the region were thermal and kinetic energy of accreted matter is radiated away in x - ray and far uv bands so gas cools down , deccelerates and finally gradually settles to the stellar surface .",
    "the source of an emission continuum are regions at the footstep of accretion streams , which absorb the hard radiation of the shock and re - emit it mainly in the region from 0.3 to 1 @xmath62 these regions are used to call hotspots although their temperature is @xmath63 k ( lamzin , 1995 ; calvet & gullbring , 1998 ) .    it was found about 20 years ago that many emission lines in ctts s spectra are superposition of so - called narrow and broad components which probably formed in regions with different physical conditions  see e.g. batalha et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and references therein . in the case of rw aur lines of ionized metals and",
    "hei have two - component structure , heii 4686 has no broad component and vice versa hydrogen lines and other neutrals have no significant narrow component ( petrov et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "fig.[he - i - v - profs ] ) demonstrates how emission part of hei 5876 line s @xmath52-profile can be decomposed onto two gaussians , which correspond to narrow and broad components . as was mentioned in the introduction petrov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have found that radial velocity of the narrow component @xmath20 varied with a period of about 2.77 days around a mean velocity @xmath64 kms@xmath12 with an amplitude @xmath65 kms@xmath12 .",
    "petrov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that narrow components are formed in the hotspot(s ) i.e. at the stellar surface .",
    "but it would be more precisely to say that they are formed _ above _ the photosphere of the hotspot , i.e. in the post shock cooling zone where helium atoms and first ions of metals appear due to recombination from higher ionization states .",
    "this remark helps to explain in natural way why narrow components have small positive velocity relative to the photosphere .",
    "it becames also clear why radial velocity of heii 4686 line is greater than @xmath20 of hei 5876 line ( petrov et al . , 2001 ) :",
    "ions appears behind the shock front before helium atoms and thus have greater velocities .",
    "however in the case of rw aur the accretion shock is placed very close to the stellar surface .",
    "indeed an existence of a veiling continuum with a flux at @xmath67  exceeding the photospheric one by 2 - 3 times ( petrov et al . , 2001 ) suggests that pre - shock gas density is greater than @xmath68 sm@xmath69 hence , a distance between the shock front and the stellar photosphere is much smaller than the stellar radius ( lamzin , 1995 ) what means that narrow components are formed practically at the stellar surface .",
    "it can be seen from the comparison of observed @xmath52-profile and modeled @xmath47-profile on fig .",
    "[ he - i - v - profs ] that the difference @xmath70 is maximal where @xmath52-profile has a steep gradient",
    ". therefore the shape of an _ observed _ @xmath47-profile of hei 5876 does not constrain a region of the strong @xmath0 by only a formation region of the narrow component .",
    "we found that if to assume _ a priori _",
    "( i.e. before cross corellation procedure ) that @xmath71 in the broad component then then field averaged over the narrow component increases by no more than 1@xmath72 .",
    "there is no doubt that the field changes its polarity . in the frame of magnetospheric accretion model",
    "this fact can be naturally explained by a change of an orientation of the hotspot relative to the earth due to stellar axial rotation .",
    "it means that the variations of the field should be periodical with the period of the stellar axial rotation .",
    "on fig.[2.77-period - curve ] phase curves of observed @xmath0 derived over the hei 5876 line are shown for the period of 2.77 days .",
    "our observations cover a time span of a few years and during the time a geometry and strength of the field could change : donati et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have discovered such changes for ctts bp tau by a comparison of stellar magnetogramms obtained with a time span of 10 month .    to minimize the effect of a physical variability of the field",
    ", we considered separately two sets of observations from table  [ blue - band ] , which contain 5 observations ( in table the sets are separated by a horizontal line ) .",
    "the first set ( left panel ) contains observations , which were carried out during 40 days and the second set ( right panel )  the next five observations covered a time span of 26 days .",
    "a global changing of a magnetic structure over times less than 40 days seems unlikely , therefore the observational variations of the magnetic field during each set is caused by the axial rotation .",
    "what about the last observation , it was carried out 360 days after tenth observation and does not shown on fig.[2.77-period - curve ] .",
    "the figure suggests that in the first set @xmath0 changes from @xmath73 kg to @xmath1 kg during @xmath65 minutes ( the time , which correspond to a phase difference of the dots 4 and 2 ) . in the second set nearly the same changing of the field strength occurred during a time span of @xmath74 minutes ( the dots 8 and 10 ) , and the field recovered to an initial level after @xmath75 hours ( the dot 9 ) .",
    "such kind of variations can not be explained by only an orbital motion of the star with @xmath76 due to an existence of a close companion .",
    "we found that the same statement is valid for any period in the range from 2.5 to 2.9 days that includes all possible values of a `` short '' @xmath77 period for rw aur a ( petrov et al .",
    ", 2001 ) .",
    "one the other hand , we have found that for a number of values @xmath78 in the range from 5.5 to 5.7 days a smooth dependence @xmath79 could be obtained even without a phase shift between the sets .",
    "an example of such curve is shown on fig .",
    "[ 5.58-period - curve ] for @xmath80 but similar smooth curve turns out for @xmath81 in other words for @xmath82 days observed variability of @xmath0 can be explained as the result of rotational modulation only , i.e. assuming that geometry and field strength in the accretion zone did not change significantly during three years of the observations .    having only 11 measurements of @xmath0 we can not derive a certain period of the axial rotation of rw aur a as well as make a conclusion concerning a variability of a geometry and/or physical conditions in the accretion zone from january 2006 to january 2009 .",
    "however , we can certainly argue that our results contradict to the rotational period @xmath83 but well consist with @xmath84 which corresponds to the model of two hotspots with opposite polarities of the field and located in opposite hemispheres .    in the frame of",
    "the model observed peculiarities of rw aur a spectrum can be explained in the following way ( petrov et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "temperature increases with height above hotspot s photosphere what results in appearence of emission lines .",
    "the strongest lines appear in the spectrum as the narrow components of helium and ionized metals lines , but more faint lines blend absorption lines of the photosphere to some extent .",
    "the hotspots move relative to the earth due to stellar rotation . due to this reason radial velocities of narrow components @xmath20 vary as well as a center of gravity of the photospheric lines what looks like a variation of their radial velocity @xmath25 this effect explains why @xmath20 and @xmath23 vary in the antiphase .",
    "it can be explained in the same way why a phase curve of hei 5876 line s narrow component equivalent width @xmath21 is shifted by one fourth of the rotational period relative to @xmath85 curve .",
    "indeed when the center of each spot crosses the plane formed by the earth and stellar rotational axis ( the central meridian ) , @xmath86 and observed area of the spot and therefore @xmath21 have maximum values .",
    "after 1/4 of the period the spot center is close to a limb and modulus of @xmath20 has a maximum but @xmath21 has a minimum .",
    "our data are insufficient to reconstruct a magnetic map of the star , so we will give below only semi - qualitative constraints on a geometry and parameters of accretion zones .",
    "a relation between @xmath0 measured over the hei 5876 line and an equivalent width of the narrow component of the line is shown on fig.[ew - he5876-vs - b ] .",
    "bear in mind written above it follows from the figure that maximal values of @xmath87 is reached when the hotspots cross the central meridian and are close to zero when hotspots are near stellar limb .",
    "one can conclude therefore that magnetic field lines in the spots make large angle relative to stellar surface , what means that toroidal component of the field in the spots is much less than poloidal one .",
    "it can be seen from fig.[he - i - v - profs ] that when @xmath0 has large negative value ( the left panel ) the helium line demonstrates deep redshifted absorption feature which has velocity extention up to @xmath88 kms@xmath12 and vice versa in the case of large positive field ( the right panel ) we observe shallow absorption .",
    "it is a particular case of the general trend : when the field increases from negative to positive values , the equivalent width of red absorption decreases .",
    "it can be seen more clear if to use equivalent width of the far redshifted part of the profile and additionaly subtract veiled photosphere ",
    "see fig.[ew - he - abs - vs - b ] .",
    "note that the main uncertainty in @xmath24 is due to uncertainty in veiling determination .    because negative values of @xmath0 appear more frequently than positive @xmath0",
    ", we conclude that a spot with @xmath5 is located in a hemisphere above a midplane of an accretion disc relative to the earth ( the `` upper '' spot ) and a spot with @xmath89 is below the disc ( the `` low '' spot ) .",
    "one can conclude that longitudes of the upper and low spots differ by @xmath90 because variations of photospheric lines radial velocities are well convolved with period @xmath91 the lower spot can be observed from the earth if its stellar latitude @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the inclination of the stellar rotational axis to the line of sight ( see the end of this section ) .",
    "maximal ( absolute ) values of field @xmath94 we observed in the upper and low spots differ from each other 1.5 - 2 times .",
    "if spots have nearly identical parameters then the same ratio must take place for averaged cosines of angles between the field lines and the line of sight for moments when the spots cross the central meridian .",
    "it follows from the modelling we carried out ( assuming the field of the star is dipol and intensity in the hei 5876 line is nearly isotropic ) that such cosine ratio could be obtained if spots located at latitudes @xmath95    red wing absorption of the helium line is formed in accreted gas of pre - shock zone .",
    "it can be easily seen that when the upper spot is visible from the earth accretion stream is projected onto larger area of stellar surface than in the case when we observe low spot .",
    "we suppose that just due to this reason @xmath24 is much less when upper spot crosses the central meridian than in the case when low spot passes throug the same meridian .    as was noted before in the case of rw aur a accretion shock front is located very close to stellar surface .",
    "therefore pre - shock zone is always projected onto underlying hotspot .",
    "apparently it is the reason why @xmath24 has never reached zero .",
    "it is interesting to note that absorption feature in the red wing of the hei 5876 , nai 5898 as well as oi 7773 lines ( petrov et al",
    ". , 2001 ) extends up to + 400 kms@xmath12 _ in all _ spectra that we know . in other words at any position of the spots relative to the earth we observe the constant red cutoff velocity of the red wing .",
    "it can be explained by assuming that @xmath96 is the largest velocity of the accreting gas and the field lines come out of the spots in a broad interval of angles .",
    "if the mass of rw aur a @xmath97 ( white & ghez , 2001 ) then corotation radius for rotational period @xmath98 is : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the stellar radius ( see the end of this section ) . as far as matter can not freez into magnetic field lines at distance @xmath101 free - fall velocity at the stellar surface is smaller than @xmath102 value defined by equation : @xmath103 what means that @xmath104 kms@xmath12 .",
    "if to replace @xmath102 by @xmath105 then it follows from the same equation that gas should start to fall along magnetic field lines from distance @xmath106 to reach stellar surface with velocity 400 kms@xmath12 .",
    "let us discuss in brief the question about the value of angle between rotational axis of rw aur a and the line of sight .",
    "hirth et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have discovered a bipolar jet of rw aur .",
    "studying temporal variations of the jet structure lpez - martn et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have found that the angle between the jet and the line of sight is @xmath107 cabrit et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have found discs around both components of rw aur and concluded that the jet is oriented along circumprimary rotational axis of rw aur a disk , such as @xmath108 found by lpez - martn is a lower limit and in fact @xmath109 if the rotational axes of the disc and the star are aligned , then the inclination of rw aur a also must be bounded between @xmath110 and @xmath111 similar estimate was derived by alencar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in modeling hydrogen and na d line profiles in the frame of disc wind model : @xmath112    petrov & kozack ( 2007 ) have argued that irregular light variability of rw aur a is mostly associated with eclipses by dust clouds .",
    "taking into account existed estimate @xmath113 of lpez - martn et al .",
    "( 2003 ) petrov & kozack supposed that the dust clouds are formed in the disc wind , because the star could not be occulted by the disc itself at such inclination .",
    "however as far as @xmath114 is turned out to be a lower limit one can suppose that the dust clouds are inhomogeneities in the disc and then at least internal regions of the disc shoul be inclined to the line of sight by an angle significantly greater than @xmath115    note finally that observed value @xmath116 kms@xmath12 ( hartmann & stauffer , 1989 ) .",
    "if rw aur a s rotational period is @xmath117 days then @xmath118 @xmath119 what can be consistent with the estimate of the stellar radius @xmath120 @xmath119 ( white & ghez , 2001 ) within uncertainties only at large @xmath121 taking in to account all these arguments we regard as reasonable estimates @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124",
    "as follows from tabl.[blue - band ] and [ red - band ] @xmath0-values did not differ always from zero within errors of measurements in formation region of iron lines , which have only broad component .",
    "the example of jd 2453784 night ( when we found @xmath125 kg in hei 5876 line formation region but @xmath126 kg over feii lines ) clearly demonstrates that magnetic field strength is different in formation regions of narrow and broad components of emission lines .",
    "another example is jd 2454846 night when @xmath127 in the broad component was @xmath128 kg but @xmath129 kg in hei narrow component .",
    "thus our data confirm the viewpoint according to which narrow and broad components are formed in different regions .",
    "gmez de castro & verdugo ( 2003 ) argued that broad components are formed at outer boundary of stellar magnetosphere within an internal ring - like region of the disk .",
    "a half - width of the broad components in rw aur spectra , except for h@xmath8-line , is @xmath130 kms@xmath12 at continuum level @xmath131 kms@xmath12 what consists with a projection of orbital ( keplerian ) velocity to the line of sight at distance @xmath132 from the star : @xmath133 remind that @xmath134 is the distance from which free - falling gas reaches velocity about 400 kms@xmath12 at the surface of the star .",
    "another nontrivial result of our observations is detection of magnetic field in the formation region of nai d lines in two spectra out of 11 .",
    "the detection is out of doubts in these two cases : firstly @xmath0 differs from zero at more than @xmath135 ( see table  [ blue - band ] ) and secondly @xmath47-curves have similar shapes for both lines of the doublet ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ na - i - v - profs ] .",
    "it is very important to note that field strength up to @xmath30 kg was found in the region where line s profile from @xmath136 to 0 kms@xmath12 is formed , i.e. in the outflow .",
    "existence of sodium atoms in the wind indicates that gas temperature in the outflow is relatively low @xmath137 k ) while gas moves with velocities up to @xmath138 kms@xmath12 what follows from an extension of nai d@xmath139 line s blue wing .",
    "thus @xmath140 is more than one order of magnitude greater than local sound velocity , what means that the outflow is driven by nonthermal , probably magneto - rotational mechanism , and the outflow is launched from the disc rather than from stellar surface ( cabrit , 2007 ; matt & pudritz , 2007 ) .    according to table  [ blue - band ] magnetic field strength variations occurred in the following way during the first three nights of our observations . at the first night",
    "@xmath0 in the spots and in the wind was zero at @xmath135-level .",
    "two days later @xmath0 has reached its maximum value @xmath141 kg in the upper spot and was equal to @xmath142 kg in the wind . at the next night",
    "@xmath0 has decreased to @xmath143 kg in the upper spot but increased up to @xmath144 kg in the wind .",
    "bear in mind discussion in the previous section this sequence of events can be interpreted in the following way . at the first night",
    "the upper spot was located near stellar limb and then @xmath0 in the wind was zero .",
    "two days later when the spot has passed through the central meridian wind s field became noticeble and reached its maximal value one day later .",
    "note that this conclusion ( sequence of events ) does not depend on precise ( unknown ) value of stellar rotation period @xmath145 but if @xmath78 indeed equal to @xmath146 then it follows from phase curve shown on fig.[5.58-period - curve ] that the longitude component of wind s magnetic field has detectable strength only at certain orientation of the system relative to the observer , reaching its maximum value at approximately @xmath147 of rotation period after passage of upper spot throug the central meridian .",
    "of course it is true only if the discovered field is related with ( quasi)stationary gas outflow rather than a fortuitous gas ejection .    to explain observed profiles of h@xmath148 h@xmath149 and nai d lines that are originated in rw aur outflow alencar et al . , (",
    "2005 ) suggested phenomenological model of the disc wind which is launched from narrow @xmath150 region near inner boundary of accretion disc .",
    "as far as the aim of these authors was to reproduce time - averaged line profiles they considered axisymmetric outflow and achieved reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "similar picture of the outflow has been reproduced by romanova et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in numerical mhd simulations .",
    "it turned out that in an axisymmetric case , when stellar rotational axis coincides with magnetic dipole axis , the outflow is launched from narrow region at the boundary between the disc and stellar magnetosphere and forms thin - walled cone with a cone half - angle @xmath151 ( so called conical wind ) .",
    "test simulations for non - axisymmetric case , when the angle between rotational and magnetic axes was @xmath152 have shown that the outflow in the cone occurred as before from the internal boundary of the disc and with the same cone angle but with azimuthal inhomogeneities of gas parameters .",
    "it can be said that in the wind ( above and below the disc ) a spiral stream is formed . inside the stream gas density and field strength",
    "are higher than in the rest part of the outflow .",
    "this picture is in a qualitative agreement with observations of rw aur : firstly , blueshifted absorption na d@xmath139 line is present permanently ( alencar et al . , 2005 ) , secondly , a non - zero field @xmath0 was observed only when the upper spot was near the central meridian .",
    "at the first glance it seems that observed value @xmath153 kg is too strong for a wind because for the magnetic field strength about 2 kg at the stellar surface the field strength at @xmath154 @xmath155 should be @xmath156 kg .",
    "however in the model of conical wind the disc compresses stellar magnetosphere what should increase the field strengs at the base of the stream .",
    "we obtained 18 measurements of rw aur a average magnetic field s longitudinal component between 2006 and 2009 yrs .",
    "our data scaterred in time and can not be used for zeeman imaging but a number of nontrivial conclusions were obtained .",
    "first of all one can definitely state that results of our observations contradict to hypothesis that explains periodical variations of rw aur a photospheric line s radial velocity as the result of orbital motion with a period of @xmath157 at the same time our data consist with petrov et.al ( 2001 ) model of two hotspots with opposite magnetic field polarities that located in opposite hemispheres , such as stellar axial rotational period @xmath158        \\2 ) longitudinal component of magnetic field _ in rw aur a s wind _ becomes significant within a certain interval of the phase curve , i.e. at a certain orientation of the system relative to the earth , reaching the maximum nearly 1/4 of the period after the passage of upper spot throug the central meridian .",
    "it can be considered as an argument that discovered magnetic field in the wind is related with a ( quasi)stationary outflow rather than sporadic gas ejection .",
    "we found that average value of rw aur a s photospheric lines radial velocity @xmath23 is smaller by 5 kms@xmath12 than value found by petrov et al .",
    "this discrepancy is seemed to be significant because the amplitude of @xmath23 variations due to stellar rotation is @xmath162 kms@xmath163 we have found two papers which contains results of more old measurements of rw aur s @xmath23 measurements : the paper of herbig ( 1977 ) , which contains only one measurement , and the paper of hartmann et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , which includes 13 measurements close in time .",
    "all available data are shown on fig .",
    "[ vrphot ] .",
    "parabola was drawn throught average values of hartmann et al .",
    ", petrov et.al and our data ( dashed line )",
    ".    the measurements presented on the figure are insufficient for an unambiguous conclusion about secular variations of rw aur s radial velocity and additional observations are necessary .",
    "however one can conclude that variations of @xmath23 by a few kms@xmath12 during @xmath15 years can not be explained by rw aur b that located at a distance more than 100 a.u . from the primary .",
    "thus we return again , but on different grounds than petrov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , to a possibility that rw aur is a triple system with orbital period of hypothetic rw aur c of several decades .",
