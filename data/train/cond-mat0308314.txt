    "although the structural sequence of the high - pressure phase transitions in si and ge has been considered to be well known since two decades , a new high - pressure phase was found experimentally between the body - centered tetragonal structure with two basis atoms ( which will be referred to the following as @xmath1-tin or bct phase ) and the simple - hexagonal ( sh ) structure in si@xcite and ge.@xcite after its space group this intermediate phase was called _ imma _ phase and corresponds to a body - centered orthorhombic bravais lattice with two atoms in the unit cell ( which will be called in the following bco ) .",
    "thus , the experimental structural sequence is found to be cd @xmath0 @xmath1-tin @xmath0 _ imma _ @xmath0 sh @xmath2 , where cd indicates the cubic - diamond structure .",
    "a bco structure was first theoretically proposed for si by needs and martin@xcite about twenty years ago , whereas lewis and cohen@xcite predicted exactly the _ imma _ phase for ge a few years before the experimental confirmation .",
    "the first theoretical investigations for si and ge indicated for both , the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ and the _ imma_@xmath0sh case , a continuous second - order phase transition.@xcite at variance , the experiments show first - order phase transitions with a discontinuity of the volume in both substances and a hysteresis effect in si.@xcite for ge the first - order transition was detected only for the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _",
    "transition,@xcite because the _ imma_@xmath0sh transition was expected to be beyond the experimentally accessible pressure range .",
    "the transition pressures in ge are expected to be higher than the corresponding ones in si , because of the strong repulsive character of the atomic potential in ge due to the presence of @xmath3 electrons in the core.@xcite from the theoretical point of view , recent total - energy calculations show two first - order phase transitions @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ and _ imma_@xmath0sh both for si@xcite and ge.@xcite a second - order phase transition was found for the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ case from elastic instabilities.@xcite    first information on the order of the phase transition can be given by group - theoretical arguments:@xcite if the order of the point group of one phase is one half of the order of the point group of the other phase , then the phase transition can be of second order .",
    "if the point group of one phase is one third of the order of the point group of the other phase , then the phase transition must be of first order .",
    "the order of the point group @xmath4 of the cd structure ( space group @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) is 48 . since the order of the point group @xmath7 of the @xmath1-tin phase ( space group @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) is 16",
    ", the cd@xmath0 @xmath1-tin transition has to be of first order .",
    "the order of the point group @xmath10 of the _ imma _ phase ( space group @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) is 8 , thus the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ transition can be a second - order one .",
    "furthermore , the order of the point group @xmath13 of the sh structure ( space group @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) is 24 , the sh@xmath0_imma _ and also the _ imma_@xmath0sh transitions are of first order . following the group - theoretical analysis none of the available total - energy calculations",
    "have described correctly the order for the phase transitions of the whole sequence , neither for si nor for ge .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ method ] we give a short overview of the methods on which our calculations are based . in section",
    "[ parameters ] we report the results for the equilibrium parameters of these phases and compare them with the experimental volume dependence .",
    "transition pressure ranges are presented in section  [ pressure ] .",
    "the order of the phase transitions is analysed in section  [ order ] , and the enthalpy barriers between the phases are determined in section  [ barriers ] .",
    "all results are summed up and discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "our calculations have been performed using the plane - wave pseudopotential approach to the density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite implemented within the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite for the exchange - correlation potential we have used the generalised - gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew and wang@xcite for si and ge , and , because of poorer results , the local - density approximation ( lda)@xcite for si only .",
    "the interaction with the ion cores has been described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials.@xcite the wave functions have been expanded in terms of plane waves up to a kinetic - energy cutoff of 270  ev ( 410  ev ) for si ( ge ) .",
    "this choice provided an error smaller than 0.5  kbar ( 0.2  kbar ) for si ( ge ) to the pressure according to the pulay stress.@xcite the pulay stress arises from using an incomplete plane - wave basis set and causes errors in the stress tensor and , correspondingly , in the pressure .",
    "convergence also required a 18@xmath1618@xmath1618 ( 24@xmath1624@xmath1624 ) mesh of monkhorst - pack points@xcite which yielded 864 ( 1962 ) * k*-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone for si ( ge ) .",
    "all high - pressure phases are metallic .",
    "thus , we have used a methfessel - paxton smearing@xcite with a width of 0.2  ev . in order to determine the total energy for a given volume or structure we have minimised the energy with a conjugate - gradient algorithm.@xcite the equilibrium properties",
    "have been obtained by fitting the values of the energy as a function of the volume alternatively to the vinet@xcite and to the murnaghan@xcite equation of state .",
    "in this section we present our results for the volume dependence of the structural parameters and compare them with the experimental ones . the structural parameters are more useful indicators of phase transitions than the often - used tangent construction to the equation - of - state curves , the difficulties of which will be illuminated .",
    "we have focussed our attention to the structural sequence @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma_@xmath0sh .",
    "the calculations for the cd phase have been performed just for the sake of comparison .",
    "the most general structure which is compatible with all four phases is the body - centered orthorhombic cell with a basis of two atoms at ( 0,0,0 ) and ( 0,@xmath17,@xmath18 ) ( bco structure ) .",
    "the other structures are special cases : for the bct structure ( @xmath1-tin ) one has the lattice constants @xmath19 and the internal parameter @xmath20 ; for the sh structure one has @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; for the cd phase one has @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the pure _ imma _ phase is realised as a bco structure with @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the minimization of the total energy has been performed using the following procedure : for all phases we have started from the bco structure and minimised the energy as a function of the structural parameters with the constraints appropriate to the various phases .",
    "in this way we have avoided an energy offset which arises from using different cells .",
    "for example , in the case of the cd structure we have imposed , according to the previous considerations , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath20 , and then we have minimised the total energy as a function of @xmath27 . in the special case of the sh structure",
    ", we could keep only the value of @xmath28 fixed at 0.5 , and we have relaxed the value of @xmath29 ( and also @xmath30 ) by minimization of the energy ; the structure which is obtained after relaxation will be indicated in the following as sh . indeed , converged calculations should be yield @xmath31 ( sh @xmath32 sh ) after relaxation . for the _ imma _ phase , all lattice and internal parameters of the bco structure were allowed to relax",
    ".    the relaxed parameters as a function of the volume are displayed in figs .",
    "[ relaxsi ] and [ relaxge ] for si and ge , respectively . the results from calculations performed withing the gga and the lda are quite similar for si .",
    "since it turned out , that the pressures calculated by gga are more accurate in si , only gga calculations have been performed for ge . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ relaxsi ] , the relaxation of @xmath29 for the sh phase of si does not match the ideal value . at variance , the calculation for ge does reproduce this value .",
    "this indicates that for a full convergence a higher kinetic - energy cutoff and/or a larger grid of special points should have been used for si .",
    "however , the condition @xmath31 is almost fulfilled in the region of stability of the sh phase .",
    "furthermore , the energy obtained from a calculation in the same cell with @xmath21 fixed and @xmath30 relaxed differs from the value obtained using the previous procedure by less than 0.7  mev .",
    "for a more detailed discussion see ref .  .",
    "the agreement between our data and those experimental ones which are not included in the figure is good : the reported value of @xmath33 for the @xmath1-tin phase of si@xcite is well within the range of our values .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 at the volume @xmath36  @xmath37 of ref .   agree with our data .",
    "furthermore , the measured value of 24.22  @xmath37 for the volume of the sh phase of si@xcite is also in the stability range we have found for this phase . for ge in the bct structure , a @xmath30 ratio of 0.5480.554 was detected experimentally@xcite corresponding to a volume region around 33  @xmath37 ; in this region , our @xmath30 ratio is 0.5460.549 . for the sh phase of ge , a @xmath38 ratio of 0.93 was measured@xcite which also agrees with our data .",
    "figures [ relaxsi ] and [ relaxge ] show that the relaxation of the general bco structure leads to the bct structure for large volumes and to the sh structure for small ones . in the intermediate region , extending from about 26.5 to 28.0  @xmath37 for si and 23.5 from 25.5  @xmath37 for ge , we localise the stability range of the pure _ imma _ phase .",
    "whereas the transition between the _ imma _ and the sh phase is characterised by a discontinuity in most of the structural parameters , the _ imma _ and the @xmath1-tin phase are quite difficult to distinguish by an inspection of figs .",
    "[ relaxsi ] and [ relaxge ] .",
    "a clearer picture is obtained from the electronic structure and the fermi energy ( see appendix  [ app ] for details ) . from this procedure , the stability range of the _ imma _ phase is from 26.6 to 28.3  @xmath37 for si  ( gga ) , from 26.6 to 28.0  @xmath37 for si  ( lda ) , and from 23.7 to 25.4  @xmath37 for ge .",
    "the standard procedure for calculating the volume change and the pressure at the transition is the so - called common - tangent construction .",
    "it relies on the fact that , in the case of a first - order phase transition , two structures with the same pressure @xmath39 and enthalpy @xmath40 but different total energy @xmath41 coexist .",
    "the volume derivative of the total energy is the negative pressure .",
    "therefore , the slope of the common tangent to the two energy curves gives the pressure for the transition between the corresponding structures .",
    "due to the fact that calculations are performed at a finite number of volumes , a fit of an analytical expression to a continuous energy curve is needed in order to obtain a continuous derivative .    in fig .",
    "[ ev ] we show the energy of the relaxed structures for si as a function of volume .",
    "the volume region where the pure _ imma _ phase is stable does not include any minimum of the total energy @xmath42 .",
    "this makes a fit to any equation of state for the _ imma _ phase slightly unstable , which results in an unreliable determination of the transition pressures and of the volume change through the common - tangent construction in this region .",
    "the results from a fit of the vinet@xcite and murnaghan@xcite equation of state are shown in table  [ eos ] for ge as well as a comparison of the lda and gga calculations for si .",
    ".equilibrium parameter determined by the murnaghan ( mur ) and vinet ( vin ) equation of state for the cd , @xmath1-tin , _ imma _ , and sh phase of si and ge .",
    "the equilibrium volume @xmath43 is in units of @xmath37 and the bulk modulus @xmath44 in kbar . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for si the value of the pressure for the cd@xmath0@xmath1-tin transition calculated with gga is within the range of the experimental values whereas the lda calculation underestimates it .",
    "we could not reproduce the experimentally observed hysteresis@xcite for the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ transition in si .",
    "for a first - order phase transitions , such as _ imma_@xmath0sh , a hysteresis could occur due to the behaviour of the hydrostatic line as in fig .",
    "[ gebcoh ] .",
    "since our results support a second - order phase transition for @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ rather than a first - order one , no hysteresis should be found in this case .",
    "the transition pressures mentioned in ref .   are obtained either from the first appearance of a new phase or from the complete transition of the sample from one phase to the other .",
    "thus we estimate the experimental range in which the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ and _ imma_@xmath0sh transitions occur in analogy to the procedure explained in section  [ pressure ] .",
    "unfortunately , the calculated transition pressures for @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ lie below the ones for the first cd@xmath0@xmath1-tin phase transition and underestimate the experimental ones .",
    "the next phase transition to be considered is _ imma_@xmath0sh . here",
    "a hysteresis was found within our calculations as well as in the experiment .",
    "the results for the transition pressures within lda underestimate again the experimental ones , whereas the ones within gga overestimate them .",
    "not included in table  [ summary ] are the experimental pressures for mixed ( 50:50 ) _ imma_-sh samples , which are 154  kbar for pressure increase and 159  kbar for pressure decrease@xcite .",
    "this is the only case in which the transition to the ( mixed ) _ imma _ phase occur at a lower pressure for an increasing than for a decreasing external pressure .",
    "all other experimental points show the same kind of hysteresis which is reproduced in our results .",
    "the difference of the pressures , where the _ imma _ phase was measured with pressure increase and decrease is 5  kbar for the mixed samples and 1112  kbar for the pure ones . from the experimental transition",
    "pressures the hysteresis is found to be between 3 and 14  kbar .",
    "within our results the largest possible hysteresis is found to be around 29 ( 24 )  kbar and the smallest around 112 ( 27 )  kbar for gga ( lda ) , which is in agreement with the experimental values .",
    "the transition pressures determined by the crossing of the enthalpy curves are found to be within the hysteresis range calculated here .    for ge",
    "the transition pressure for the cd@xmath0@xmath1-tin transition is slightly smaller than the experimental one but the results for the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ transition match much better . in the experiment@xcite",
    "just the @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ transition was examined , because the transition pressure for the _ imma_@xmath0sh transition was higher than the maximum accessible pressure of 810  kbar . in comparison to the experimental results of si",
    "it is assumed that the _ imma _ phase for ge is stable from 750 to 850  kbar , which is compatible with the observation of a sh phase at 900  kbar.@xcite from this point of view , the transition pressure calculated here is slightly too high .",
    "there are many reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the experimental ones . on one hand ,",
    "the experimental conditions like pressure profiles or measurement times are not perfectly controlled , whereas nonhydrostaic conditions affect the transition pressures ; on the other hand , temperatue effects , which are neglected in our calculation , could be of some relevance .",
    "in fact , for si the theoretical transition pressure decreases with increasing temperature.@xcite",
    "we have presented a first - principles investigation of the pressure - induced phase transitions cd @xmath0 @xmath1-tin @xmath0 _ imma _ @xmath0 sh in si and ge . numerical accuracy has required these calculations to be performed within the same unit cell and the pressure to be calculated from the stress tensor instead of using any equation of state .",
    "we have determined the phase transitions by investigating the relaxed parameters , the enthalpy vs.  pressure curves , and the hydrostatic condition . from the pressure dependence of the relaxed structure parameters the hysteresis effect does not seem to have been verified in a theoretical investigation before .",
    "an examination of the hydrostatic condition provides a thermodynamical explanation for the existence of this hysteresis .",
    "further on , the orders of the phase transitions have been investigated with the helps of the curves of the enthalpy vs.  pressure and of the derivative of the enthalpy vs.  pressure .",
    "for si the transitions _ imma_@xmath0sh and @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ are found to be of first and of second order , respectively . for ge",
    "the results support a second - order @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ transition more than a first - order one , but in this case the order can not be definitely determined .",
    "a calculation of the enthalpy barriers between the phases show a vanishing barrier between the @xmath1-tin and the _ imma _ phase for si , which also supports the second - order @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma _ transition , whereas no barrier could be found for all @xmath1-tin@xmath0_imma_@xmath0sh transitions .",
    "finally , our alternative results are fully consistent with each other and show an acceptable agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "support by the heinrich bll stiftung , germany , is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we examined the volume dependence of the fermi energy of bct , bco , and sh . in fig .",
    "[ fermi ] we show the fermi energy reduced by the bco values for ge , @xmath45    in the range of stability of the @xmath1-tin phase the fermi energy of bco is identical with the one of bct .",
    "similarly , the fermi energy of bco and sh are identical in the range of stability of the sh phase .",
    "therefore , the regime where the fermi energy of bco is neither equal to the one of bct nor to the one of sh is assumed here to be the range of stability of the pure _ imma _ phase .",
    "the energy values @xmath47 are reduced in such a way that the fermi energy at any volume is set equal to zero , @xmath48 in most of the volume range presented in fig .",
    "[ eigen ] the band structure presents a linear dependence on volume .",
    "however , the energy gradients differ for each structure . within the transition region between the _ imma _ and the sh phase one observes a small discontinuity ( here apparent at @xmath49@xmath37 ) which is attributed to the first - order phase transition . when starting from the @xmath1-tin phase , a deviation of the bco band energies from the bct energies can be observed , which increases continuously .",
    "thereby , the degeneracy of the bct bands is lifted , which indicates the appearance of the less symmetrical _ imma _ phase .",
    "the behavior of the band structure for si is very similar to the one of ge ."
