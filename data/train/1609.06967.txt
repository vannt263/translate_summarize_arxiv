    "the investigation of various exotic shapes in the atomic nucleus is a long - standing subject in nuclear physics .",
    "the observations of chiral doublet bands and wobbling bands provide direct evidence for the stable triaxiality of nuclei .",
    "nuclear chirality was first predicted in 1997 by frauendorf and meng  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , more than 30 candidate chiral nuclei have been reported in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 mass regions . for more details",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the wobbling motion was originally suggested by bohr and mottelson in the 1970s  @xcite , and has been found mainly in the @xmath6 mass region  @xcite , and very recently in the @xmath7 region  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , many approaches have been developed to investigate nuclear chirality and wobbling motion , such as the particle rotor model ( prm )  @xcite , the tilted axis cranking model ( tac )  @xcite , the tilted axis cranking plus random phase approximation ( tac+rpa )  @xcite , the interacting boson fermion - fermion model ( ibffm )  @xcite , the pair truncated shell model ( ptsm )  @xcite , and the projected shell model ( psm )  @xcite .",
    "the prm is a quantal model , where the spin is a good quantum number and the quantum tunnelings between the partner bands are obtained automatically .",
    "however , it requires some physical quantities , such as the quadrupole deformation parameters and the moments of inertia , as its inputs .",
    "in addition , the separation between the single particles and the rotor is sometimes obscure .",
    "the tac is based on the mean - field approximation , and it can be easily extended to treat multi - quasiparticle configurations . however , to describe the chiral or wobbling partners is beyond the scope of the tac .",
    "thus , the tac+rpa going beyond the mean - field approximation was developed , but it is restricted to only small amplitude motions such as chiral vibrations or harmonic wobbling modes .    recently , a collective hamiltonian ( ch ) method based on the tac approach was constructed and applied to the description of chiral vibration and rotation for the system with one @xmath1 proton particle and one @xmath1 neutron hole coupled to a triaxial rotor  @xcite .",
    "this ch introduces the orientation of the rotational axis , the azimuth angle @xmath8 , as a dynamical variable ; it differs from the bohr hamiltonian  @xcite where the deformation parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the euler angles @xmath11 are the collective coordinates .",
    "it was found that the ch achieves nice agreement with the exact solutions of the prm for the energy spectra of the chiral partners  @xcite .",
    "similar successes have also been achieved for the wobbling motions in the simple , longitudinal , and transverse wobblers  @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the orientation of a rotational axis in triaxial nuclei should be parameterized by the azimuth angle @xmath8 and the polar angle @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "however , in the previous studies  @xcite , only the dynamical motions along the @xmath8 direction was considered , i.e. , a one - dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 1dch ) .",
    "it was constructed with a one - dimensional collective potential @xmath13 , which is determined by minimizing the total routhian @xmath14 with respect to @xmath12 at each given value of @xmath8 . despite the successes of the 1dch , it is interesting to extend the collective hamiltonian to two dimensions , by considering both @xmath12 and @xmath8 as collective variables , and to explore the related new physics .    in this work ,",
    "the collective potential and the mass parameters in the two - dimensional collective hamiltonian ( 2dch ) are extracted from the tac calculations . as an example , the developed 2dch will be applied for a system with one @xmath1 proton particle and one @xmath1 neutron hole coupled to a triaxial rotor with the triaxial deformation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained results will be compared with those obtained by the 1dch and the exact solutions calculated by the prm .",

    "similar connections can be also found between the two - dimensional @xmath121 levels 1 , 3 , and 5 , and the one - dimensional @xmath142 levels 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the zero phonon excitation modes along the @xmath12 direction are weakly coupled with the excitations along the @xmath8 direction .",

    "[ fig6 ] , no one - dimensional counterpart has been found for the two - dimensional @xmath124 levels 2 , 4 , and 5 , and the @xmath121 levels 2 , 4 , and 6 . to further examine this point",
    ", we also plot the probability distributions of the 2dch along the @xmath12 direction as shown in fig .",
    "the probability distributions are calculated from the wave functions ( [ eq7 ] ) , and the @xmath8 direction has been integrated by @xmath147 apparently , for each 2dch level which has an one - dimensional correspondence , i.e. , 1 , 3 , 6 in the @xmath124 group and 1 , 3 , 5 in the @xmath121 group , the corresponding probability distribution along the @xmath12 direction has only one peak , and this is associated with a zero - phonon vibration mode along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "in contrast , the probability distributions of the other levels have more than one peak , and they correspond to nonzero - phonon vibration mode along the @xmath12 direction . as a result",
    ", they have no counterpart in the solutions of the 1dch . note that we have also checked the wave functions for other rotational frequencies , and",
    "a similar conclusion can be obtained . to avoid repetition ,",
    "the results are not shown here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we label the counterparts between the 2dch levels and the 1dch ones with dashed lines .",
    "one can see that , with increasing energy , the energy differences between the 2dch and 1dch solutions become larger .",
    "this indicates that the one - dimensional approximation is reasonable at low excitation energy .",
    "on the other hand , at high rotational frequencies , e.g. , @xmath148 , the 1dch levels and their 2dch counterparts are very close to each other .",
    "this demonstrates that the one - dimensional approximation may be good at high rotational frequencies , where the rotation mode is close to a principal axis rotation .      in the preceding two sections ,",
    "the 2dch collective energy levels and wave functions have been discussed in comparison with the 1dch ones . as was demonstrated in our previous work  @xcite",
    ", the 1dch restores the broken chiral symmetry in the aplanar tac solutions and provides the collective wave functions , which are either symmetric ( @xmath149 ) or antisymmetric ( @xmath150 ) with respect to @xmath116 transformation .",
    "in such a way , it forms pairs of chiral doublet bands along with the increasing rotational frequency . by mapping these one - dimensional solutions to the two - dimensional ones as discussed above ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and  [ fig6 ] ) , one can certainly expect that the solutions of 2dch , which have zero - phonon excitation along the @xmath12 direction , can form pairs of chiral doublet bands as well .    before discussing the other states obtained in the 2dch",
    ", we here recall that the two - dimensional solutions are grouped into four categories with the combination of the symmetries @xmath118 and @xmath119 . in fact , the operator @xmath65 is equivalent to the chiral operator @xmath151 , while the operator @xmath64 is equivalent to @xmath152 , or equivalently , the combination of the signature operator @xmath153 and chiral operators @xmath65 . here ,",

    "note that we consider here only the lowest level in each group associated with @xmath118 and @xmath119 . with the increasing rotational frequency ,",
    "all the energy splittings show decreasing tendency up to @xmath158 , while they slightly increase at @xmath159 ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the decrease of the energy splittings at @xmath158 has been discussed in ref .",
    "they are caused , at low frequencies , mainly by the gradual increase of the mass parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and at high frequencies , mainly by the appearance of the potential barrier in the collective potentials ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "note that in this region of rotational frequency , the energy splittings between the signature partners are smaller than those between the chiral partners , and this can be understood from the behaviors of the mass parameters @xmath23 and @xmath26 , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] .",
    "the energy splittings increase when @xmath160 , and here the minima of the corresponding tac solutions are at @xmath161 , which means that the total angular momentum aligns along the intermediate axis , i.e. , the axis with the largest moment of inertia .",
    "the solutions of 2dch are mainly from the vibrational motions around the minima @xmath161 of the tac solutions .",
    "in addition , we note that the angular momenta of the proton and neutron also align along the intermediate axis due to the strong coriolis interaction .",
    "this is reminiscent of the so - called longitudinal wobbling motion  @xcite , in which the wobbling frequency increases with the rotational frequency .",
    "therefore , we clearly provide , in the present framework , a transition from the chiral rotation to the longitudinal wobbling motion .      for a system with a triaxial rotor coupled to one particle and one hole , its exact solution can be obtained by the diagonalization of the prm hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , to examine the quality of the collective hamiltonian , it is necessary to compare its results with those obtained by the prm . for the 1dch",
    ", this comparison was made and it was found that not only the yrast band but also the excited partner band in the prm can be reproduced by the 1dch  @xcite . compared with the 1dch , the 2dch further takes the dynamical motion of the @xmath12 degree of freedom into account and , thus , requires again a comparison with the prm results .    in fig .",

    "the angular momentum is calculated by considering the fluctuations along the @xmath12 and @xmath8 directions on top of the tac solutions : @xmath162 here , @xmath163 is the angular momentum calculated by tac at a given value of @xmath96 , i.e. , @xmath164 and each component of the angular momentum @xmath165 is the sum of the angular momenta of the particle , the hole , and the rotor at a given @xmath96 : @xmath166 similar to the tac calculations , a quantal correction @xmath167  @xcite to the angular momentum @xmath168 has also been applied .    , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 as functions of rotational frequency obtained from the 2dch in comparison with the yrast and yrare bands 1 and 2 in the prm and the yrast band 1 in the tac .",

    "the results obtained from the 2dch agree slightly better with those of the prm .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we show the calculated energy spectra of these bands . for the tac calculations ,",
    "the energy spectra are calculated from the total routhian as @xmath172 for the 2dch , they are calculated with the same method , but the total routhians are obtained by solving the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) . in the presented results , the energy references of the tac and the 2dch are the same .",
    "it has been known that the prm results show a change of the rotational mode from chiral vibration to chiral rotation , and to wobbling motion at extremely high spins  @xcite . as mentioned in above discussions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] ) , this feature can be given in the present 2dch results . moreover , in the high - spin region , the calculated bands with both the prm and the 2dch split into four signature branches , while the tac solutions can not provide such splitting .",
    "quantitatively , the 2dch can reasonably reproduce the prm results .",
    "the favored signature branch of band 1 in the prm is reproduced by the lowest band in the @xmath124 group of the solutions of the 2dch .",
    "the unfavored signature branch of band 1 and the favored one in band 2 are nearly degenerate in the prm , and this is well reproduced by the states in the groups of @xmath121 and @xmath122 in the 2dch solutions .",

    ". this may be due to the vibrational frequencies in the mass parameters being neglected in the present calculations ; it may not be a good approximation at the low - spin region , because in such cases , the collective potential is harmonic - like with one minimum .    in order to clarify this issue",
