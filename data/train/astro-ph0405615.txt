    "the standard scenario of low - mass star formation envisions quasi - static condensation of dense cores out of magnetically subcritical clouds and inside - out core collapse leading to star formation ( shu , adams & lizano 1987 ; mouschovias & ciolek 1999 ) .",
    "an alternative is the turbulence - controlled star formation , with magnetic fields playing a minor role if any ( larson 1981 ; mac low & klessen 2004 ) . in this picture , dense cores arise from compression in the supersonic turbulence observed in molecular clouds ( padoan et al . 2001 ; gammie et al . 2003 ; li et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the cores so formed are transient entities , however . even though some of them may have column density distributions resembling those of static bonnor - ebert spheres , their internal motions are typically dynamic , with transonic or even supersonic speeds ( ballesteros - paredes , klessen , & vzquez - semadeni 2003 ) which are difficult to reconcile with the subsonic internal motions inferred in low - mass starless cores ( lee , myers & tafalla 1999 ) .",
    "a potentially more serious difficulty with this picture is the rate and efficiency of star formation .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that supersonic turbulence decays in one free - fall time or less , with or without a strong magnetization ( mac low et al .",
    "1998 ; stone , ostriker & gammie 1998 ; padoan & nordlund 1999 ) . without additional support , self - gravitating clouds would collapse in one free - fall time , leading to a rate of star formation well above that inferred on the galactic scale ( evans 1999 ) . also , stars in typical low - mass star forming clouds contain less than a few percent of the cloud mass .",
    "such a low star formation efficiency is not naturally explained .",
    "excessive star formation is avoided in the standard scenario by an ordered magnetic field , which is postulated to provide most of the cloud support .",
    "the gradual weakening of magnetic support through ambipolar diffusion leads to core formation .",
    "the cores so formed tend to have subsonic infall speeds consistent with observations ( li 1999 ; ciolek & basu 2000 ) .",
    "however , calculations based on this scenario have so far avoided a direct treatment of turbulence by starting from relatively quiescent regions of moderately high density ( several times @xmath0  @xmath1 or higher ) , as opposed to the average cloud density ( a few times @xmath2  @xmath1 or lower ; blitz 1993 ) .",
    "how the over - dense regions form out of the more turbulent background in the first place was not addressed .",
    "it is unlikely for them to have condensed out quasi - statically through ambipolar diffusion , because the level of ionization in the background is enhanced over the value given by cosmic ray ionization alone ( mckee 1989 ) , as a result of photoionization of interstellar far - ultraviolet radiation field .",
    "the enhancement makes the time scale for quiescent ambipolar diffusion at the average density longer than the cloud lifetime ( myers & khersonsky 1995 ) . in this letter , we show that the supersonic turbulence observed in molecular clouds can speed up ambipolar diffusion in localized regions through shock compression without turning most of the cloud mass into stars in one crossing time .",
    "we consider strongly magnetized , sheet - like clouds , taking advantage of the tendency for cloud material to settle along field lines into a flattened configuration .",
    "the basic formulation we adopt here is the same as that of nakamura & li ( 2002 , 2003 ) and li & nakamura ( 2002 ) , which was originally developed for treating ambipolar diffusion - driven fragmentation of quiescent magnetic clouds in the presence of small perturbations ( see also indebetouw & zweibel 2000 and basu & ciolek 2004 ) .",
    "briefly , we assume that the fluid motions are confined to the plane of the sheet , with force balance maintained in the vertical direction at all times ( fiedler & mouschovias 1993 )",
    ". the cloud evolution is governed by a set of vertically integrated mhd equations that include ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we consider the case where the magnetic field is coupled to the bulk neutral cloud material through ion - neutral collision , with ion density proportional to the square root of neutral density .",
    "a canonical value of @xmath3@xmath4g@xmath5 is adopted for the proportionality constant ( elmegreen 1979 ) .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamic part of the governing equations using roe s tvd method , and determine the gravitational and magnetic potentials outside the sheet using a convolution method based on fft .",
    "the computation timestep is chosen small enough to satisfy both the cfl condition and the stability condition for treating ambipolar diffusion explicitly .",
    "we consider an initially uniform mass distribution in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane , with column density @xmath8  g  @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is visual extinction for standard grain properties ) .",
    "the cloud is assumed isothermal , with sound speed @xmath11  cm  s@xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the temperature in units of 10  k ) . above a critical column density @xmath14 , the equation of state",
    "is stiffened to enable simulation beyond the formation of the first `` collapsed '' object .",
    "the jeans length @xmath15  pc and gravitational collapse time @xmath16  yr provide two basic scales for our problem .",
    "we adopt a computation box of size @xmath17 ( corresponding to a cloud mass @xmath2 times the jeans mass @xmath18  @xmath19 ) , and impose periodic conditions at the boundaries .",
    "the cloud is threaded vertically by a uniform magnetic field , characterized by the flux - to - mass ratio @xmath20 in units of the critical value @xmath21 . only strongly magnetized clouds with @xmath20 close to or exceeding unity",
    "are considered , in keeping with the adopted thin - sheet approximation .    to mimic the turbulent motions observed in molecular clouds",
    ", we stir the cloud with a supersonic velocity field at @xmath22 . following the usual practice ( e.g. , stone et al .",
    "2000 ) , we prescribe the turbulent velocity field in fourier space , with a power spectrum @xmath23 .",
    "other choices yield qualitatively similar results , as long as the power is dominated by large - scale motions .",
    "numerically , we adopt a @xmath24 grid , and consider only discrete values @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the box size and @xmath27 , 2 , ... , n-1 , with @xmath28 ) for wavenumber components , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for each pair of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we randomly select an amplitude from a gaussian distribution consistent with the power spectrum for the total wavenumber @xmath31 and a phase between 0 and @xmath32 . the resulting field is then transformed into the physical space .",
    "the spatial distributions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are generated independently , and the final velocity field is scaled such that the rms mach number of the flow @xmath35 has a prescribed value .",
    "the velocity fields so specified tend to be strongly compressive . adopting an incompressible turbulent velocity field does not change the result qualitatively .",
    "two representative clouds will be considered in detail , one magnetically subcritical with @xmath36 and the other supercritical with @xmath37 .",
    "we choose a mach number @xmath38 , which yields a turbulence crossing time @xmath39 .",
    "the results are displayed in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "1 presents the snapshots of the clouds at various times , and fig .",
    "2 shows , as a function of time , the mass fraction of the regions that have become more than 10 times denser ( in column density ) than the average _ and _ are magnetically supercritical .",
    "these so - called `` dense supercritical '' regions contain both `` collapsed '' objects whose contraction has been arrested by the stiffening of the equation of state and isothermal core material well on its way to star formation .",
    "we will use their mass fraction as a measure of the efficiency of star formation , bearing in mind however that probably only a fraction ( say 1/3 to 1/2 ) of the dense supercritical material would be turned into stars in the presence of powerful protostellar outflows ( matzner & mckee 2000 ; shu , li & allen 2004 ) .",
    "we begin with the subcritical cloud .",
    "its snapshots are displayed in the first five panels of fig .  1 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the cloud after about one turbulence crossing time ( at @xmath40 , in units of @xmath41 here and below ) , when a large fraction of the cloud mass has been compressed into a network of filaments .",
    "the filaments would collapse quickly were it not for the strong magnetic fields trapped in them .",
    "by @xmath42 ( panel b ) , they are well on their way to re - expansion , leaving behind little dense supercritical material ( which has a mass faction of order @xmath43 according to fig .  2 ) .",
    "although most of the shocked regions do not collapse right away , they are permanently altered .",
    "their flux - to - mass ratios are changed by ambipolar diffusion , whose rate is enhanced by the increase in both density ( which weakens the field - matter coupling ) and gradient of the field strength .",
    "the magnetically altered regions can not return to their pre - compression , uniformly magnetized state after shock passage .",
    "rather , a magnetically differentiated structure develops , with regions of relatively low flux - to - mass ratio embedded within a more strongly magnetized background .",
    "the supercritical `` islands '' are marked by white contours in each panel .",
    "these regions have a head - start over their subcritical surroundings in forming stars , through further turbulent compression and/or ambipolar diffusion .",
    "( we have tested our standard simulation of @xmath36 in the limit of zero ambipolar diffusion , and found that the @xmath44 ratio remains constant to within @xmath45 . )    after the initial phase of strong compression and re - expansion , the cloud settles down to a more relaxed configuration .",
    "an example of this new phase of cloud evolution is shown in panel  ( c ) .",
    "prominent at this time ( @xmath46 or @xmath47  myrs , adopting here and below the fiducial combination @xmath48 and @xmath49 , appropriate for taurus clouds according to arce & goodman 1999 ) are several supercritical filaments , the densest parts of which have already begun dynamic contraction and formed `` collapsed '' objects .",
    "note that the dense star - forming regions are well separated , reminiscent of the dispersed mode of star formation observed in taurus - like clouds .",
    "once created by large - scale compression at well separated locations , the dense regions stay apart because their mutual gravitational attraction is cancelled to a large extent by the magnetic repulsion between them .",
    "this mode is illustrated further in panel  ( d ) , where @xmath50 ( or @xmath51  myrs ) and @xmath52 of the cloud mass now resides in the dense supercritical regions .",
    "note that the dense `` ridge '' at the lower - left corner has a much lower velocity than its surrounding medium .",
    "this is also true for other high density regions in general , broadly consistent with the observation that low - mass star forming cores are more quiescent than their surroundings .",
    "the mass fraction of dense supercritical regions increases steadily , as a result of continued ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the steady increase is punctuated by bumps at late times ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "these bumps are produced by interactions of dense regions , which are evident in panel  ( e ) of fig .  1 , where @xmath53 ( or 18  myrs ) .",
    "the interactions become more important as more cloud material becomes supercritical , since the gravitational attraction between supercritical regions is not completely offset by magnetic repulsion .",
    "the unbalanced `` effective '' gravity tends to drive the supercritical regions together , which enhances the possibility for further interactions .",
    "the clustering of `` heavier '' supercritical regions against a more strongly magnetized background may , given enough time , drive the cloud from the initial dispersed mode of star formation to a clustered mode of star formation .",
    "in the regions where the dense supercritical material preferentially gathers , the local efficiency of star formation can be much higher than the average .",
    "the magnetically supercritical cloud evolves differently .",
    "its snapshots are displayed in the last three panels of fig .  1 .",
    "panel  ( f ) shows the cloud at @xmath54 , when a network of filaments has formed , as in the subcritical case , although the filaments here are thinner , because of a weaker magnetic resistance to shock compression .",
    "these filaments are sufficiently supercritical that , when enough mass is accumulated , they break up gravitationally into a string of dense cores along their length , unlike their more magnetized counterparts . by the time shown in panel  ( g ) ( @xmath42 ) ,",
    "some of the dense cores have already merged together , creating several dense supercritical regions .",
    "these regions contain about half of the cloud mass ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "they dominate the subsequent cloud evolution through mutual gravitational interactions . by the time shown in panel  ( h ) ( @xmath55 ) ,",
    "some of the dense regions have merged together , and new blobs have formed through interactions .",
    "most of the dense regions are clustered together gravitationally .",
    "the clustering is retarded only moderately by magnetic repulsion , since the cloud is magnetically supercritical as a whole , and the dense regions are even more so .",
    "nearly @xmath56 of the cloud mass does become subcritical , however , as a result of magnetic flux diffusing from the high - density to low - density regions .",
    "it may explain why the mass fraction of the dense supercritical regions hovers around half , rather than a value closer to unity as one might naively expect for supercritical clouds .",
    "we have explored the effects of the same ( strong ) turbulence on clouds with other degrees of magnetization , including one that is critically magnetized everywhere initially ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "dense supercritical regions are created promptly in this cloud , with a mass fraction intermediate between that of the subcritical ( @xmath36 ) and supercritical ( @xmath58 ) cloud , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "2 is a more subcritical cloud with @xmath59 .",
    "it does not produce a dense supercritical object until @xmath60 ( or @xmath61  myrs ) .",
    "such a long dormant time would argue against star - forming clouds being subcritical by a large factor everywhere , although a stronger turbulence can in principle induce localized cloud collapse and star formation sooner . in practice , a distribution of the flux - to - mass ratio @xmath20 is expected in realistic clouds .",
    "the least magnetized regions are expected to collapse first , either on their own ( if they are supercritical and self - gravitating ) or through turbulent compression .",
    "in such a case , the star formation rate and efficiency would obviously depend on the @xmath20 distribution , which is unknown at present .",
    "we have demonstrated that star formation with a relatively low efficiency can occur over an extended period of time in highly turbulent , somewhat magnetically subcritical clouds . the low efficiency is made possible by the strong magnetic field , which prevents the global cloud collapse in one turbulence crossing time .",
    "the supersonic turbulence , on the other hand , speeds up ambipolar diffusion in localized regions through shock compression .",
    "the acceleration of ambipolar diffusion by turbulence has been examined analytically by kim & diamond ( 2002 ) , zweibel ( 2002 ) and fatuzzo & adams ( 2002 ) , and numerically by heitsch et al .",
    "our investigation differs from these studies in adopting a highly compressive turbulent flow and in that the cloud dynamics are computed rather than prescribed .    to further illustrate the role of turbulence in star formation , we have rerun the subcritical ( @xmath36 ) case , varying the turbulent mach number @xmath35 from 0.3 to 10 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "3 . for @xmath62",
    ", it takes an order of magnitude longer than the gravitational collapse time to produce the first dense magnetically supercritical object . as @xmath35 increases ,",
    "dense supercritical regions appear earlier . beyond some critical value ( @xmath63 for our particular examples ) ,",
    "such regions form promptly , within one collapse time .",
    "the ability for a subcritical cloud to form stars quickly in the presence of a supersonic turbulence removes a major objection to the standard scenario for low - mass star formation through ambipolar diffusion based on cloud lifetime arguments ( hartmann , ballesteros - paredes , & bergin 2001 ) .",
    "our calculations support the idea of bimodal star formation ( shu et al .",
    "1987 ) . in magnetically subcritical clouds ,",
    "dense supercritical regions are created by large - scale turbulence at well separated locations .",
    "they stay separated until a large enough fraction of the cloud mass becomes supercritical for the gravitational attraction to overwhelm the magnetic repulsion .",
    "we identify this mode of star formation with the mode of relatively inefficient , dispersed star formation exemplified by the taurus clouds .",
    "if the cloud lives long enough , a large fraction of the cloud mass will become supercritical sooner or later , through continued ambipolar diffusion . in regions where the supercritical materials collect gravitationally",
    ", the star formation efficiency could be much higher than the general background .",
    "such regions could be the sites of efficient cluster formation .",
    "efficient star formation occurs much more quickly if the cloud is initially magnetically supercritical , as in our second example .",
    "our simulations suggest that a realistic turbulence with power dominated by large - scale motions does not fundamentally change the bimodal nature of star formation in magnetic clouds .",
    "3d calculations are needed to firm up this conclusion .",
    "we thank c. gammie and e. ostriker for helpful discussion .",
