    "graphene is a novel material with highly unusual electron properties , related to the dirac form of its energy spectrum at low energies , and demonstrated in many seminal experiements ( for review see  @xcite ) .",
    "experiments on single - layer graphene have been performed on the flakes obtained by exfoliation as well as grown on a substrate .",
    "graphene also has excellent mechanical properties .",
    "indeed , the elastic properties have been measured on suspended graphene flakes mechanically deposited over a hole by indentation in an atomic force microscope  @xcite ; the results showed that graphene is incredibly stiff , with the breaking strength of the order of @xmath0n / m , the young modulus of 1  tpa , and possibility to be stretched elastically up to 20@xmath1 .",
    "bending properties have been determined experimentally for several - layer graphene flakes  @xcite and are not yet available for a monolayer . theoretically , these properties have been predicted from the calculations using the analytical form of the interatomic potential , and from molecular dynamic studies  @xcite .",
    "graphene is currently one of the most prospective candidates for high - frequency nanomechanical resonators  @xcite , with the quality factor and eigenfrequency extracted from measurements to be @xmath2 , @xmath3  mhz for a monolayer , and @xmath4 , @xmath5  mhz for 15 nm thick graphite .",
    "quality factor further increases with decreasing temperature . an alternative method to investigate elastic properties of graphene is to put the film on a flexible substrate and deform the substrate  @xcite .",
    "the strain influences optical phonon spectum  @xcite , which has been measured by raman spectroscopy .",
    "recent experiments combine mechanical and electrical properties of graphene by measuring conductivity  @xcite of suspended graphene flakes .",
    "this is a very promising direction since suspended graphene flakes exhibit much higher mobility than graphene on substrate due to much weaker disorder  @xcite .",
    "potentially electrons can produce back - action on the resonator .",
    "graphene resonators are expected to have high sensitivity to mass and prebuilt strain  @xcite , so that they can be used to ultra - sensitive mass detection .",
    "suspension of graphene flakes always leads to their deformation , which in turn affects the conduction properties of graphene .",
    "deformation creates inhomogeneous elongation of the lattice constant  @xcite which locally affects the electron spectrum of graphene .",
    "one way to look at the variations of the band structure of the strained graphene is to perform density functional calculations  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the variation of the lattice constant can be represented at the level of dirac equation in the form of pseudomagnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "ref .   pointed out that local shifts of the fermi surface in suspended graphene in the vicinity of the dirac point can block the conductivity  if the fermi - surfaces at different parts of the flake do not overlap , the conduction is tunnel rather than metallic .",
    "effects of disorder due to charged impurities and midgap states , optical and acoustic phonons were taking into account for calculating conductivity of gated graphene in  @xcite .",
    "for strong enough deformation , graphene quasiparticles can become localized  @xcite .    in experiments , graphene flakes",
    "are typically suspended over a back - gate .",
    "this gate redistributes the electron density in the flake due to the spatial variation of the capacitance .",
    "the regions in the center of the suspended part of the flake have higher electron density then the regions near the clamping edges , as the central part is closer to the gate .",
    "this density redistribution affects the transmission coefficients through the entire flake .",
    "the corresponding effect on the piezoresistivity in ballistic regime is of the first order in the maximum deformation of the flake in the transverse direction , and it increases the conductivity .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the effect of the pseudomagnetic fields which suppress the conductivity .",
    "the contribution from pseudovector potential depends on the strain  @xcite over the flake and is of the second order in the maximum deformation .",
    "thus , this contribution is expected to be weaker than effect from the charge redistribution .",
    "we will show however that this effect can be important for graphene under high enough residual stress .",
    "inhomogeneous deformation of graphene yields the corrections to the conductivity which are of the fourth order in the maximum deformation , which is even smaller .    in this article",
    ", we calculate the effect of the gate - induced density redistribution on the conductivity of the graphene flake .",
    "we find that , indeed , for high residual stress the correction resulting from the pseudovector potential is important , and the correction to the conductivity is negative .",
    "we mostly focus on the regime of low residual stress and show that the correction from the charge redistribution becomes the most important .    experimentally ,",
    "influence of deformation on the conductivity would be difficult to observe on a suspended graphene flake with one gate since the main effect of the gate is the global shift of the density rather than its redistribution .",
    "to separate density redistribution and elastic deformation , one needs to employ two gates .",
    "for instance , one can use the configuration with a large bottom gate and a narrow top gate .",
    "the bottom gate deforms the graphene flake and determines the maximum transverse deformation @xmath6 .",
    "when voltage is switched on the narrow top gate it does not influence much of deformation of the flake depleting the charge density below the top gate . since the region under the top gate has the lowest density it determines the conductivity of the whole flake .",
    "if this region is brought to the dirac point , the correction to conductivity is determined only by the deformation of graphene  @xcite and is proportional to @xmath7 , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the voltage applied to the bottom gate and the length of the strip under the top gate .",
    "however , for higher voltages the charge redistribution is more important , and the correction to conductivity is proportional to @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the distance to the bottom gate . instead of the top gate",
    ", one can use an afm tip .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : deformation ] we derive equations for the deformation of suspended graphene from general theory of elasticity .",
    "we consider two situations  graphene deformed homogeneously by a gate and graphene deformed locally by an afm tip .",
    "the capacitance between the gate and suspended graphene varies due to deformation of the flake .",
    "we calculate the density redistribution over the flake taking into account the shape of the flake . in section  [ sec : piezo ] , we use these results to evaluate correction to the conductivity .",
    "we use the perturbation theory to calculate the transmission eigenvalues , and the correction to the conductivity is obtained using the landauer formula .",
    "this correction can be big for sufficiently strong deformations of the flake which can be produced by an afm tip . in section [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results and the regimes not considered in this article .",
    "in this section , we calculate the profile of the graphene sheet formed by electrostatic forces induced by the gates . for this purpose",
    ", we decompose the total energy of the flake as the sum of electrostatic and elastic energies .",
    "we consider a graphene flake of the length @xmath9 ( direction @xmath12 ) and the width @xmath13 ( direction @xmath14 ) . for simplicity , we assume @xmath15 . an undeformed sheet occupies a part of the plain @xmath16 ; the electrostatically induced deflection is @xmath17 .",
    "below we only consider small deformations so that we can stay within the limits of linear theory of elasticity ( hooke s law ) . at stronger deformations , as expected from the general theory  @xcite and also confirmed by theoretical modeling  @xcite and by experiments  @xcite on graphene , non - linear terms become important .",
    "however , there is a considerable parameter range , with the displacements up to 50 nm , where the linear regime is still valid .",
    "we discuss the terms which go beyond hooke s law  @xcite in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    for electrostatic energy , similarly to ref .",

    "the total electrostatic energy of the system carrying the charge @xmath24 is @xmath25    with @xmath26 .    from now on",
    ", we assume that the contacts are ideal , @xmath27 , and thus the electrostatic energy is @xmath28 the effect of non - ideal contacts is discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we evaluate the elastic energy in the thin - plate approximation .",
    "the elastic energy consists of the bending contribution @xmath29 and the stretching contribution @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the deformation tensor , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the coordinates in the plane of the sheet ( @xmath12 and @xmath14 ) . in the linear regime , the bending contribution is less important than the stretching one , however , we consider both contributions for completeness .",

    "in addition , if a local force ( for instance , an afm tip ) acts on the graphene flake , it is best represented by external pressure @xmath41 .",
    "the work of this external pressure to deform the flake by @xmath42 is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the surface element .",
    "the profile of the sheet is determined by minimizing its total energy . performing the variation , we find the equation describing the shape of the flake , @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the electrostatic pressure on the plate , induced by the variation of electrostatic energy ( [ elstatenergy ] ) . for ideal contacts , @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the electron density .",
    "( [ generalform ] ) is the most general equation for @xmath17 in the linear approximation of theory elasticity .",
    "for an infinitely wide graphene flake , @xmath15 , the deformation in the @xmath14 direction is homogeneous .    at sufficiently small deformations ,",
    "the tension along the sheet is constant over the sheet  ( [ generalstretch ] ) , @xmath49 .",
    "the tension @xmath50 is the sum of two contributions : @xmath51 the first one , @xmath52 , is the residual stress which results from the fabrication process or is induced by the ripple formation  @xcite .",
    "the second contribution , @xmath53 , is an internal force due to the relative elongation @xmath54 ( hooke s law ) .",
    "if we take this term into account , we can go beyond the thin - plate approximation and consider deformations bigger then the thickness of the graphene layer .    in the two following subsections ,",
    "we solve the above equations for two specific situations : homogeneous external force ( which can be produced by a bulk bottom gate ) , and local force ( produced for example by an afm tip ) .      applying a voltage on a bottom gate",
    "is a standard way to vary electron density in graphene .",
    "if the suspended graphene flake is charged , it is subject to a mechanical force proportional to the charge density .",
    "if the area of the gate is much larger than the area of the flake , the electron density induced by the gate is constant almost everywhere , @xmath55 , except for the clamping points of the flake , where it is determined not only by the solution of the poisson equation ( providing singularities at the capacitor edges ) , but also by the metallic leads to which the flake is clamped . indeed ,",
    "experimental evidence for this charge inhomogeneity exist and can be accessed by asymmetry of the dirac peak in conductivity  @xcite",
    ". however , these density inhomogeneities at the clamping areas very little affect the deformation , since the displacement vanishes at the edges of the flake .",
    "therefore we can approximate the effect of the gate by homogeneous electrostatic pressure over the flake , @xmath56 , @xmath8 and @xmath11 being the gate voltage and the distance to the gate .",
    "the profile of the graphene sheet is found from the equation @xmath57 where the stress @xmath50 is constant over the sheet  ( [ tension ] ) and the deformation - dependent contribution to it depending has to be found self - consistently , @xmath58 ( the case for inhomogeneous @xmath53 derived in ref .",

    "it was shown experimentally  @xcite that suspended graphene flakes are described with good precision as purely ballistic .",
    "theoretically , conductance is determined by landauer formula  @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the transmission eigenvalue in the transport channel @xmath84 , and the factor @xmath116 is conductivity of a single transport channel which takes into account valley and spin degeracy .",
    "the number of open transport channels @xmath117 is proportional to the fermi momentum @xmath118 , and thus the conductivity is proportional to the square root of the electron density @xmath84 , @xmath119 .",

    "the density becomes inhomogeneous  @xcite .",
    "in particular , poisson equation leads to the square root divergence of the electron density at the clamping points , as in any capacitor ( see e.g. ref . ) . to treat this divergence properly",
    ", one has to take into account electrostatic interaction with the contacts near the edge of the graphene strip , which modifies significantly the electron density near the edge , removing the divergence .",
    "however , the effect of this inhomogeneous density close to the contacts does not affect the piezoconductivity of the flake , since the deformation close to the clamping points is very weak , and thus it can be included into the contact resistance at the clamping points .",
    "we now turn to the effects of the deformation on the conductivity .",
    "deformation of graphene can change the conductivity by inducing changes in the band structure ( which results in pseudo - magnetic fields ) as well as by changing the electron density over the flake .",

    "is that the graphene flake is `` glued '' to the walls at the suspension point .",
    "whereas this has been realized in some experiments  @xcite , it describes the situation when the residual strain @xmath52 is of the same order or higher than the strain induced by the gate voltage .",
    "the residual strain results from the fabrication process and is most likely to be created by impurities in the substrate .",
    "it can be made low on purpose since the strain is reduced after annealing  @xcite . in the opposite situation , when the residual stress is not significant , the pseudomagnetic field is inhomogeneous and distributed over the whole suspension area .",

    "we show below , however , that the correction from non - uniform stretching is of the order of @xmath150 , but still due to large prefactor it can reduce the conductivity at low gate voltages .",

    "conductivity can also be used to measure relative stretching of deformed suspended graphene . note that the influence of stretching on the conductivity of graphene deposited on a substrate has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite . for suspended graphene",
    "it is more difficult to extract the value of stretching than from the graphene on the substrate , since the gate voltage simultaneously varies the concentration and deforms graphene , as shown above .    to measure relative stretching of suspended graphene",
    ", we propose the two - gate geometry ( fig .  [ topgate ] ) .",
    "the deformation of the graphene flake is created by the large bottom gate , the influence of the top gate on the deformation is small as the top gate is narrow .",
    "the top gate is used to vary the charge density in the region underneath it . in this geometry at the fixed voltage at the bottom gate",
    "one can move through the dirac point by varying the voltage at the top gate ( the experiment for bilayer with two gates on the substrate  @xcite ) .",
    "the value of conductivity at this point depends on the deformation .",
    "the stretching of the graphene flake , as discussed above , induces variations of the conductivity for two reasons .",
    "first , it induces pseudomagnetic fields .",
    "these , however , can be gauged away of dirac equation @xcite at the dirac point and do not influence the conductivity .",
    "second , it shifts the fermi velocity .",
    "the relative shift is proportional to the deformation , @xmath196 , and leads to the positive correction of the conductivity at the dirac point , @xmath197 .",
    "thus , for different bottom gate voltages , which is equivalent to different maximum deformations @xmath6 , the conductivity at the dirac point is slightly different , and the relative graphene stretching can be restored from this dependence .",
    "for example , consider the dependence of conductivity on the top gate voltage for different bottom gate voltages ( fig .",
    "[ topgate ] ) . at a fixed value of the bottom gate voltage , the conductivity as a function of the top gate voltage exhibits a peak dependence , with the minimum corresponding to the dirac point .",
    "the difference between the values of conductivity at dirac peaks , @xmath198 , for different bottom gate voltages , @xmath199 and @xmath194 , is proportional to the difference in relative deformation , @xmath195 ( we remember that @xmath200 ) .",
    "in this article , we investigated two mechanisms which affect the conductivity of suspended graphene  charge redistribution induced by the gate(s ) , and pseudomagnetic fields induced by the deformation of graphene .",
    "we find that for the small residual stress @xmath52 , the charge redistribution mechanism dominates . for low gate voltages and strong deformation , which experimentally is best realized by using afm , the correction due to nonuniform pseudomagnetic fields is more significant .",
    "the correction due to pseudovector potential at the region of suspension can decrease conductivity at the large residual stress  @xcite .",
    "it is important that the two mechanisms provide corrections to conductivity which are of different signs .",
    "indeed , the correction from pseudomagnetic fields suppresses the conductivity  @xcite by shifting k - points due to the vector potential .",
    "the shift is different at different points of the suspended sample , and if the deformation is big enough , the fermi circles at the clamping points and at the centre of the flake do not overlap : the system becomes insulating .",
    "if now we take into account the effects of the gate , not only the fermi circles are shifted , but their radii are greater at the center of the flake since the charge density is greater in the areas closer to the gate .",
    "the increase of the radii and the shift of the center compete , and we find that typically the radius increase is more important .",
    "it is difficult to measure piezoconductivity only by using a bottom gate since the gate voltage not only bends graphene and produces the correction to the conductivity , but also shifts the overall charge density .",
    "the density dependence of the conductivity is different from the density dependence of the correction .",
    "thus , to extract the value of piezoconductivity , one has to compare the conductance of deformed and undeformed graphene sheet at the same density , which can only be done in the one - gate geometry by comparing the results with the theoretical prediction .",
    "in contrast , the two - gate setup , with a bottom gate fixing the overall density and the top gate ( which can be an afm tip ) creating the deformation is more convenient to extract piezoconductivity .",
    "one can fix the voltage on the bottom gate and start to deform the flake with the afm tip . at low gate voltages",
    "the conductivity decreases due to the pseudomagnetic fields , whereas at higher voltages it starts to grow due to the charge redistribution .    in the real experimental situation",
    ", the afm tip has a point shape , whereas in this article we considered for illustration the deformation homogeneous in one direction , _",
    "i.e. _ replaced the tip by a rod .",
    "non - homogeneous deformation in all directions creates pseudomagnetic fields , with the conductivity depending not only on the transverse displacement , but also locally on the position over the graphene sheet .",
    "the conductivity is the largest if the tip is placed in the middle of the sheet , and decreases if the tip moves to the side",
    ". we can understand this behavior from a simple reasoning .",
    "indeed , the electrons which from the two sides of the tip feel the pseudomagnetic fields and interfere similarly to an aharonov - bohm ring .",
    "the interference is more destructive if the tip is further from the center , and thus the conductivity decreases .",
    "another parameter which affects the conductivity is the residual stress @xmath52 .",
    "it can be varied experimentally for instance if one uses graphene suspended over piezosubstrate .",
    "putting voltage on the substrate would induce extra stress on graphene , and one can move from the situation where pseudovector potential blocks the conductivity at low gate voltages to the case where residual stress does not play a role and the correction due to charge redistribution increases the conducitivity .    in this article",
    ", we considered ideal ballistic graphene .",
    "in particular , we disregarded the contact resistance , assuming the clamping points to be ideal contacts .",
    "finite transparency of the contacts would suppress both the conductivity itself and the piezocorrection to the conductivity ; in addition , it would raise the amplitude of fabry - perot resonances .    for strong deformations of the graphene sheet , the problem becomes much more complicated , since one has now to solve elasticity equations self - consistently , taking into account that the displacement depends on the charge redistribution .",
    "this leads to additional terms in the equations of the elasticity theory . taking into account influence of the density redistribution on the term with electrostatic pressure in the equation of deformation",
    ", one can show that the self - consistency condition increases the deformation in the middle of the graphene sheet .",
    "this effect only becomes important at sufficiently strong deformations .",
    "finally , we assumed that undeformed graphene is flat . in reality , it is always rippled , and , in principle , one needs to use the elasticity theory for membranes .",
    "however , we do not expect that taking ripples into account would significantly affect the results of this paper .",
    "first , the ripples are small and have a large radius of curvature , which means they are very little affected by the overall deformation of the graphene sheet .",
    "second , the main effect of the ripples is to renormalize the energy over the graphene sheet  @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that our results are valid , but for renormalized energy over the flake ( energy is determined by gate voltage in clean case , and is renormalized in the rippled case ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the conductivity of graphene sheet deformed over a gate . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the deformation on the conductivity is twofold : the lattice distortion can be represented as pseudovector potential in the dirac equation formalism , whereas the gate causes inhomogeneous density redistribution . </S>",
    "<S> we use the elasticity theory to find the profile of the graphene sheet and then evaluate the conductivity by means of the transfer matrix approach . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the two effects provide functionally different contributions to the conductivity . for small deformations and not too high residual stress the correction due to the charge redistribution dominates and leads to the enhancement of the conductivity . for stronger deformations , </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the lattice distortion becomes more important and eventually leads to the suppression of the conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> we consider homogeneous as well as local deformation . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest that the effect of the charge redistribution can be best measured in a setup containing two gates , one fixing the overall charge density and another one deforming graphene locally . </S>"
