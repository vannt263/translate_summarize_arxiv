    "active systems are fundamental elements in high precision measurements in particular measurement on quantum systems .",
    "amplifiers are used either for amplifying the signal to a macroscopic level or to make the system work around its optimal working point with the help of feedback loops .",
    "the analysis of sensitivity limits in these devices rises many questions related to fundamental processes as well as experimental constraints .",
    "how does the active feedback act on the quantum system ?",
    "how does the coupling with the environment influence the sensitivity of the measurement ? how are these process related to the fluctuation dissipation theorem ?",
    "how do the experimental constraints interplay with the fundamental limitations of the sensitivity ?",
    "the aim of the present paper is to address the question of measurement on quantum systems with real measurement devices .",
    "we address this problem with quantum network theory .",
    "this approach provides a rigorous thermodynamical framework able to withstand the constraints of a quantum analysis of the measurement . in the same time , it makes possible a realistic description of real measurement devices .",
    "thermodynamic and quantum fluctuations are treated in the same footing .",
    "the measurement process is described as a scattering process allowing for a modular analysis of real quantum systems .",
    "active systems such as the linear amplifier or the ideal operational amplifier are described in this framework . here , the approach will be illustrated by analyzing the sensitivity of a cold damped capacitive accelerometer developed for fundamental physics applications in space @xcite .",
    "we first present the analysis of a quantum measurement with a passive systems in term of quantum networks .",
    "then , we use this approach to present the quantum analysis of measurements with an operational amplifier working in the ideal limit of infinite gain , infinite input impedance and null output impedance and we illustrate the theoretical framework with the example of a cold damped accelerometer .",
    "we conclude with an analysis of chained measurements",
    "the measurement of a physical quantity or signal corresponds to the obtention of a result or readout from a measureing device . in general , this is obtained after a few stages .",
    "many times , the signal is transduced into an electrical signal which is amplified .",
    "after further processing , the resulting voltage drives a displaying or a storing device .",
    "the final result is thus obtained after a succession of stages .    as far as measurement at the quantum level is concerned",
    ", the principle is the same : a chain of processes leads from the quantum system to the readout of the meter . as a first insight into a quantum analysis of measurement , we will consider the detection of an electromagnetic wave with an antenna and first restrict our attention to the transduction of the wave into an electrical signal .",
    "as sketched on figure [ antenne ] , a detecting antenna is coupled with an electrical resonator a coaxial line is used to extract an electrical signal from this system .",
    "the further steps as for instance amplification will be considered in the next section .",
    "the the antenna is coupled to the electromagnetic field though one mode obtained as a linear combination of plane waves or spherical waves and corresponding to the radiation diagram of the antenna . in this mode",
    "two counterpropagating fields can be separated an incoming field @xmath0 and an outgoing field @xmath1 .",
    "the incoming electromagnetic wave @xmath2 puts into motion the electrons in the antenna and produces a current flow in the circuit . as a consequence of this current",
    ", a signal @xmath3 with informations on the detected radiation is sent into the coaxial line .",
    "this electrical signal may then be used to feed a further element , for instance an amplifier .",
    "in addition , any incoming signal @xmath4 arriving in the coaxial line also creates a current in the detector and can perturb the measurement .",
    "for example , if the line is at thermal equilibrium , it corresponds to the johnson nyquist noise .",
    "finally , energy and information can be lost because of the emission of radiation by the antenna .",
    "these phenomena , present in every measurement can be synthetized in the following way . in the frequency domain the output fields",
    "can be written as linear combinations of input fields . throughout the paper",
    ", we will consider that a function @xmath5 is defined in the time domain ( notation @xmath6 ) or in the frequency domain ( kubo s notation @xmath7 $ ] ) and that these two representations are related trough the fourier transform with the convention of quantum mechanics @xmath8",
    "e^{-i\\omega t}\\ ] ] the electronics convention may be recovered by substituting @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "the _  detection and measurement _ is then described as a scattering process : @xmath11 the measurement of the field @xmath12 with the current @xmath13 can be described with an estimator@xmath14@xmath15 the incoming current fluctuations correspond to a noise in the measurement .",
    "it is also possible to express the output field @xmath1@xmath16 @xmath17 coreponds to the back action noise on the measured device .",
    "this kind of description of a measurement can be generalized to more complex systems in the framework of quantum network theory .    in this approach ,",
    "the role of the antenna and the line are to couple the measurement device with the outside world for inputs as well as for outputs .",
    "this coupling is associated to _ dissipation and fluctuations _ which are thus inavoidable in measurement processes_. _ dissipation corresponds to the loss of energy by the resonator as emitted radiation by the antenna or as an electrical signal by the line .",
    "fluctuations corresponds to the detection of the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the input fields .",
    "since einstein and its study of the viscous damping of mechanical systems @xcite the link between fluctuations and dissipation has been widely studied .",
    "for example with johnson - nyquist noise in resistive electrical elements @xcite .",
    "in our situation , the energy loss of the oscillator has to be counterbalanced by the detection of thermal radiation by the antenna and the thermal current of the line . in the high temperature limit",
    ", it leads to the usual thermodynamic @xmath18 per degree of freedom , with @xmath19 being boltzmann constant and @xmath20 the radiation temperature . note that as a consequence",
    ", thermodynamics imposes constraints on the scatering matrix resulting from the two principles .",
    "we will analyse precisely these constraints in the general framework of quantum networks .",
    "the classical result on the link between fluctuation and dissiaption was extended to take into account the quantum statistical properties of fluctuations@xcite .",
    "a general approach of these relations was widely studied in the framework of linear response theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , in the zero temperature limit , the detected field corresponds to the vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and the induced energy of the oscillator is the zero point energy @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the resonance frequency of the oscillator .",
    "the elementary systems described up to now as well as more complex devices to be studied later in this paper may be described by using a systematic approach which may be termed as `` quantum network theory '' .",
    "initially designed as a quantum extension of the classical theory of electrical networks @xcite , this theory was mainly developed through applications to optical systems @xcite .",
    "it has also been viewed as a generalized quantum extension of the linear response theory which is of interest for electrical systems as well @xcite .",
    "it is fruitful for analyzing non - ideal quantum measurements containing active elements @xcite .    in this quantum network approach ,",
    "the various fluctuations entering the system , either by dissipative or by active elements , are described as input fields in a number of lines as depicted on [ network ] .",
    "for example , a resistance @xmath23 is modeled as a semi - infinite coaxial line @xmath24 with characteristic impedance @xmath23 . in this line ,",
    "current and voltage may be treated as quantum fields propagating in a two dimensional space - time .",

    "furthermore , the derivative of this signal provides a force proportional to the mass velocity and simulates a friction force .",
    "this active friction is called cold damping since it may be noiseless .",
