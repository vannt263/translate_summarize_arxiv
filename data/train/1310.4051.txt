    "<S> we diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath60 numerically on a @xmath61 lattice , and find that an in - gap state appears in the presence of a single impurity . for simplicity , we only show the results on donors , and the acceptor situation is similar . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath86mev@xmath87mev , a wide conductance plateau with the quantized value @xmath6 emerges for obc while bulk conductance is zero and all bulk states are localized for pbc . in this regime , the localization length , @xmath88 @xcite , is found to be much smaller than both the length @xmath3 and width @xmath2 of the system , as shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> to estimate the localization length @xmath1 , we use pbc along the @xmath72 direction and scale the bulk conductance @xmath89 with varying length @xmath69 and fixed width @xmath70 at samples .    </S>",
    "<S> when the fermi energy is tuned to the regime @xmath90mev@xmath81mev or @xmath82mev@xmath91mev , we find that although the bulk conductance increases according to the calculation with pbc , the total conductance for a system computed with obc decreases at plateau edge . </S>",

    "<S> the localization length @xmath1 increases rapidly and when it is comparable to the sample width but much smaller than the sample length ( @xmath92 ) , the electron at one edge state can interfere with in - gap bound states in the bulk and will be scattered to the opposite edge . </S>",
