    "<S> this talk describes the physics input of qcdins , a monte carlo event generator for qcd - instanton induced scattering processes in deep - inelastic scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> hard scattering processes in strong interactions are successfully described by perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> however , perturbation theory does not exhaust all possible hard scattering processes : instantons @xcite , non - perturbative fluctuations of the gluon fields , induce hard processes which are absent in perturbative qcd . </S>",
    "<S> deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera offers a unique window to detect these processes through their characteristic multi - particle final - state signature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a monte - carlo generator for instanton - induced events in dis , qcdins , interfaced with herwig , has been developed @xcite which enabled the h1 collaboration to place first experimental upper limits on the cross - section @xcite and which allows for the elaboration of dedicated search strategies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this talk is to outline the basic physics input of qcdins and its built - in features , characteristic for the underlying instanton mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> further details about the theoretical background @xcite and ongoing experimental searches @xcite appear elsewhere in these proceedings .    in order to appreciate the notion of instanton - induced scattering processes , </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that scattering amplitudes are derived via analytic continuation and lsz reduction from euclidean green s functions , which in turn can be represented by a path integral , @xmath0[d\\psi][d\\overline{\\psi } ] a_{\\mu}(x_{1})\\ldots \\psi ( x_{i})\\ldots               \\overline{\\psi}(x_{n } )          \\exp\\{-s\\,[a,\\psi,\\overline{\\psi}]\\ } .\\ ] ]    the perturbative scattering amplitudes are obtained from an expansion of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pathintegral ] ) about the _ perturbative - vacuum solution _ , i.e. vanishing gluon fields , @xmath1 , and vanishing quark fields , @xmath2 , with vanishing euclidean action @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion can be summarized by the familiar feynman rules which construct the perturbative scattering amplitudes in terms of propagators and vertices as a power - series in the strong coupling @xmath4 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp ] ( left ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ instanton @xmath5 _ is a _ non - trivial solution _ of the euclidean gluon - field equations and thus a non - trivial local minimum of the euclidean action with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> instanton - induced scattering amplitudes , being derived from an expansion of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : pathintegral ] ) about the instanton , can be constructed according to modified feynman rules , which involve , in addition to the propagators ( in the @xmath7-background ) and vertices ( in the @xmath7-background ) also the classical fields ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp ] ( right ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> instanton - induced scattering amplitudes are always exponentially suppressed at weak coupling , @xmath8 .    in qcd with massless quarks , usual perturbation theory and instanton perturbation theory </S>",
    "<S> describe two distinct classes of processes : in usual perturbation theory , quarks are coupled to gauge fields only via vector couplings , which _ conserve chirality _ ( @xmath9 ) . thus quarks always appear in pairs with net chirality zero ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : comp ] ( left ) ) and chirality is conserved to all orders . in instanton - perturbation theory , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , only scattering amplitudes for processes which _ violate chirality _ by @xmath10 units receive non - vanishing contributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that the classical quark solutions always appear in pairs with net chirality two ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : comp ] ( right ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the monte - carlo simulation of @xmath7-induced events proceeds in three steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , quasi - free partons are produced by qcdins with the distributions prescribed by the hard process matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> next , these primary partons give rise to parton showers , as described by herwig . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the showers are converted into hadrons , again within herwig .    </S>",
    "<S> the momentum - space structure of @xmath7-induced hard processes in @xmath11 scattering is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : me ] ( left ) . as is already suggested by the form of the leading - order matrix elements in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : comp ] ( right ) , the amplitudes factorize into a product of an effective @xmath12 vertex @xcite , denoted by a blob in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : me ] ( left ) , times matrix elements for @xmath7-induced partonic subprocesses , @xmath13 , denoted by a blob with an index `` @xmath7 '' . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the most important kinematical variables determining the final state properties of @xmath7-induced events are the virtuality of the off - shell quark @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the bjorken scaling variable of the @xmath16 subprocess , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore let us discuss their distributions first .    to this end , we square the amplitudes in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : me ] ( left ) and sum over all final state partons to construct the @xmath7-induced hard - scattering partonic total cross - section or structure function . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown @xcite that the initial state collinear singularities , occuring when @xmath18 , can be consistently absorbed into the parton distribution functions @xmath19 , such that the @xmath7-induced contribution to the nucleon - structure function is obtained in the familiar convolution form , @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the renormalization ( factorization ) scale . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7-contribution to the dominating gluon - coefficient function @xmath22 in turn , has for large @xmath23 the anticipated momentum - space structure @xcite , @xmath24 the essential instanton dynamics and in particular most of the dependence on @xmath25 and @xmath26 is encoded in the @xmath7-subprocess total cross section , @xmath27\\   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : me ] ( middle ) ) are known @xcite for @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> we see from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cross - section ] ) that the summation over the gluon emission has modified the exponential suppression factor by the so - called `` holy - grail '' function @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> this exponentiation is due to the fact that every gluon emission brings in a factor of @xmath32 in the exclusive amplitudes ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : comp ] ( right ) ) , such that @xcite @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> the holy - grail function @xmath29 is continuously decreasing from @xmath34 at @xmath35 ( low @xmath16 c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy ) to @xmath36 at @xmath37 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : me ] ( middle ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross - section is correpondingly exponentially growing with decreasing @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly seen in the @xmath25 distribution taken from the monte - carlo simulation ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : me ] ( right ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the chosen renormalization scale , @xmath38 , the @xmath7-subprocess cross - section ( [ eq : cross - section ] ) , as a function of the @xmath14 virtuality @xmath26 , has a peak structure which is clearly reflected by the @xmath26 distribution in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : i_dist ] ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peak is at around 5 gev , which is gratifying since it means that even without a lower @xmath26 cut can be enforced by requiring the transverse momentum @xmath39 of the current - quark jet ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : me ] ( left ) ) to be large . </S>",
    "<S> a lower @xmath25-cut can be implemented , for example , by requiring @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath42 c.m . </S>",
    "<S> energy . </S>",
    "<S> [ foot : cuts ] ] most of the events generated are hard enough in order to justify instanton - perturbation theory @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : i_dist ] ( right ) we present the resulting @xmath7-induced total @xmath43 cross - section for hera , subject to the following cuts : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ @xmath44 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : conv ] ) ; _ ii ) _ @xmath45 in the integration of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coeff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> no cut on @xmath26 has been imposed . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that lower limits on @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be enforced experimentally by cuts on final state momenta@xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : i_dist ] ( right ) have been taken from the monte - carlo simulation ( qcdins 1.4.1 ) . as a check of the monte - carlo , we have also analytically integrated eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : conv ] ) and ( [ eq : coeff ] ) . the resulting cross - section ( lines in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : i_dist ] ( right ) ) nicely agrees with the monte - carlo result . </S>",
    "<S> we refrain from going to even smaller @xmath47 , say @xmath48 , since in this case @xmath49 would be only of order @xmath34 gev@xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear whether in this case the corrections to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : coeff ] ) , which are not built into qcdins , can be neglected .    as a benchmark for searches for @xmath7-induced events at hera @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> let us compare the @xmath7-induced hera cross - section from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : i_dist ] ( right ) with the normal dis hera cross - section , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the fraction of @xmath7-induced events at hera , @xmath52 , ranges between @xmath53 in the kinematical range @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the published upper limits on the fraction of @xmath7-induced events placed by the h1 collaboration @xcite are in the several percent range . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement of these limits by an order of magnitude is reported in another talk in this working group @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us turn now to the final states of @xmath7-induced events in dis . </S>",
    "<S> the current quark in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : me ] ( left ) will give rise , after hadronization , to a current - quark jet . </S>",
    "<S> the partons from the @xmath7-subprocesses , @xmath13 ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : me ] ( left ) ) , on the other hand , are emitted spherically symmetric in the @xmath16 c.m . </S>",
    "<S> system ( `` @xmath7-c.m . </S>",
    "<S> system '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon multiplicities are generated according to a poisson distribution with mean multiplicity @xmath55 which is of the order of two for @xmath37 , @xmath56 gev ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : typical ] ( left ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total mean parton multiplicity is large , of the order of ten . </S>",
    "<S> after hadronization we therefore expect from the @xmath7-subprocess a final state structure reminiscent of a decaying fireball : production of the order of 20 hadrons , always containing strange and possibly charmed mesons , concentrated in a `` band '' at fixed pseudorapidity @xmath57 in the ( @xmath57 , azimuth angle @xmath58)-plane . </S>",
    "<S> due to the boost from the @xmath7-c.m . </S>",
    "<S> system to the hera - lab system , the center of the band is shifted in @xmath57 away from zero , and its half - width is of order @xmath59 , as typical for a spherically symmetric event . </S>",
    "<S> the total invariant mass of the @xmath7-system , @xmath60 , is expected to be in the 10 gev range , for @xmath37 , @xmath56 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the lego plot of a typical @xmath7-induced event shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : typical ] ( right ) shows that these expectations ( current - quark jet ; hadronic `` band '' ) are actually bourne out from our monte - carlo simulation . </S>"
