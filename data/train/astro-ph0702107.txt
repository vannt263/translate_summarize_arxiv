    "the @xmath5 scuti variables are late a and early f - type stars that populate the instability strip near or slightly above the zero - age main - sequence , from luminosities @xmath6 3.0 mag to @xmath7 0.5 mag .",
    "both radial and non - radial pulsation modes have been detected in these stars .",
    "the large - amplitude ( @xmath8 0.25 mag ) variables have been referred to in the literature as dwarf cepheids , hads ( high amplitude @xmath5 scuti ) and sx phe stars ( population ii dwarf cepheids ) if they are metal poor .",
    "the large - amplitude variables with asymmetrical light curves are radial pulsators pulsating usually in the fundamental mode , but some exhibit pulsation in both the fundamental and first harmonic .",
    "the variables found in globular clusters tend to be fundamental mode pulsators if they have large asymmetric light curves , while the stars with large symmetric light curves or small amplitude variables , @xmath9 0.1 mag , tend to be pulsating in higher modes ( usually the first harmonic ; mcnamara , 2000 ) .",
    "an excellent review of the properties of these stars can be found in breger ( 2000 ) .",
    "since these variables obey a period - luminosity ( @xmath1 ) relation they can be utilized as standard candles to find distances .",
    "given their intrinsic faintness and the short time scale of their variations ( typical periods range from 1 to 5 hours ) , the known samples of @xmath0 scuti stars almost exclusively belong to the milky way where they are found in the field and in both globular and open clusters .",
    "@xmath0 scuti or dwarf cepheids found in globular clusters are population ii dwarf cepheids ( sx phoenicis ) .",

    "the comparison between the lmc distance moduli obtained by the @xmath0 scuti @xmath1 relation and by the model fitting technique is presented in section  5 , along with a discussion of results obtained from other pulsating stars in the lmc , namely rr lyrae stars and cepheids .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is based on @xmath2 ccd observations in the johnson - cousins photometric system of a high amplitude @xmath0 scuti star in the lmc obtained with the 1.5 m eso telescope , la silla , chile , in 1999 and 2001 by c03 and df05 .",

    "recently , buzasi et al.(2005 ) have found altair to be a @xmath0 scuti star .",
    "equation ( 1 ) predicts for the star an absolute magnitude of @xmath22 = 2.204 ( @xmath23 and [ fe / h ] = 0.00 ) , which compares very well with @xmath22 = 2.208 , derived from the star s very accurate parallax .    although a paper giving more details regarding equation ( 1 ) is in preparation by one of us ( d.h.m . ) , a few details are given here .",
    "this equation is superior to other equations derived in the past because it introduces a metallicity term .",
    "@xmath1 relations derived previously without the metallicity term have much steeper negative slopes ( see , for example , mcnamara 1997 and petersen & christian - dalsgaard 1999 ) .",
    "the steeper slope can be attributed to the fact that the metal - poor variables are fainter than the metal - rich ones and are found primarily at short periods .",
    "lutz - kelker ( 1973 ) corrections were applied to the magnitudes calculated from the parallaxes .",

    "the mean error of the @xmath26 values due to parallax errors is @xmath3 0.13 mag , indicating that the cosmic scatter in the relation is @xmath270.09 mag since the dispersion is @xmath30.16 mag .",
    "the cosmic scatter is a consequence of the finite width of the instability strip .",

    "this is a remarkable agreement when one considers that the two equations were derived by independent methods .",

    "the lmc variable discovered by c03 and df05 ( # 28114 ) is a large amplitude variable with very symmetrical light curves as is evident in figure  1 .",
    "this suggests the star is pulsating in the first harmonic or a higher mode . in what follows",
    "we assume that star is a first harmonic pulsator , accordingly the star s period in table  [ t : table1 ] has been named @xmath50 .",
    "actually , only as a first harmonic pulsator can we derive a reasonable distance to the lmc from the @xmath1 relation , and a good theoretical fit of the star s light curves ( see section 4 ) .",
    "we will show later that when the period is fundamentalized the star fits the @xmath1 relation defined by the other @xmath0 scuti candidates in the lmc .",
    "the @xmath51 value , column 3 of table  [ t : table1 ] , is fundamentalized by adopting the ratio of the first harmonic to the fundamental period ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath520.773 .",
    "this ratio has been well established from double - mode pulsators in the galaxy ( petersen & christensen - dalsgaard , 1996 ) .",
    "the corresponding fundamental period is @xmath53 .",
    "we do not have a direct estimate of the metallicity of star # 28114 .",
    "since in the case of the galaxy the stars with @xmath31 longer than -1.1 are restricted pretty well to @xmath24 $ ] near 0.0 , we assume that the same is true in the case of the lmc stars with @xmath31 values greater than -1.1 .",
    "in particular , we assume that star # 28114 is typical of the intermediate age population in the lmc where [ fe / h ] = @xmath140.40 ( russell & dopita 1990 ) .",
    "this is also the average metallicity of the lmc cepheids ( luck et al .",
    "the m@xmath54 value of star # 28114 following from equation ( 1 ) is then m@xmath551.23 @xmath56 mag .",
    "a change of @xmath30.1 dex in metallicity would cause a change of @xmath30.02 mag in the @xmath26 value of star # 28114 derived through eq .",
    "according to c03 the average color excess of rr lyrae stars in the lmc bar in the direction of the variable is @xmath57 , leading to an absorption of @xmath58 = 0.36 mag ( @xmath59 assumed ) .",
    "the apparent magnitude of the @xmath5 scuti star is @xmath60 = 19.94 @xmath3 0.09 mag ( table  [ t : table1 ] ) , that combined with the absolute magnitude of @xmath22 = 1.23 @xmath30.16 mag , and with the visual absorption of a@xmath54 = 0.36 @xmath3 0.05 mag , leads to a true distance modulus for the lmc of @xmath61 = 18.35 @xmath3 0.19 mag , ( where the error is the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties in the photometry , reddening and absolute magnitude ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to employ directly the observed @xmath62 value of the @xmath0 scuti variable to infer its color excess .",
    "galactic @xmath5 scuti stars indicate that @xmath63=0.185 @xmath3 0.015 mag at the period of # 28114 ( mcnamara 1997 ) .",
    "if we adopt @xmath63=0.17 ( we allow for a decrease in @xmath63 for a decrease in metallicity ) and assume @xmath64 0.145 mag as appropriate for [ fe / h ] = @xmath140.4 , then the equation :    @xmath65    given by cousins and caldwell ( 1985 ) to convert to @xmath66 , yields @xmath67 = 0.256 mag .",
    "this value of @xmath67 when combined with the observed @xmath66 = 0.332 mag suggests a color excess of @xmath4 = 0.076 @xmath68 mag for star # 28114 .",
    "this color excess agrees well with the reddening maps of schlegel , et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which give a mean foreground reddening of the lmc of @xmath4 = 0.075 @xmath69 mag .",
    "schlegel , et al .",
    "value is the average of @xmath4 measurements in annular rings about the lmc center .",
    "since there is little change from ring to ring it represents a very meaningful value for the foreground reddening of the lmc . on the other hand ,",
    "the burnstein & heiles ( 1982 ) maps indicate that the lmc is located in the color excess contours of 0.06 and 0.09 mag , thus supporting the schlegel et al .",
    "mean value of 0.075 .",
    "the observational evidence thus seems to indicate that the color excess of this variable can not be as large as 0.116 mag .",
    "in fact , if @xmath4=0.116 , the @xmath67 color of star # 28114 would be too blue ( 0.216 mag ) .",
    "even extremely metal - poor variables have redder @xmath67 values , of the order of 0.25 mag .",
    "further , we anticipate that also the `` pulsational '' reddening derived from the light curve fitting ( see section 4 ) is smaller than c03 average value for the area , and very close to the reddening inferred from the star intrinsic color ( @xmath70=0.07@xmath3 0.14 ) .",
    "given the patchy nature of the reddening in the lmc it is possible that our target star has lower than average reddening .",
    "another possibility is that the star is a foreground object subject to a smaller extinction . finally , a third possibility is that the spatial distribution along the line - of - sight of the old stars ( namely the rr lyrae variables ) from which c03 reddening was derived is different from that of much younger objects as the @xmath0 scuti stars or the cepheids .",
    "for instance , an average value @xmath4=0.07 is obtained by considering individual cepheids in the lmc ( see caldwell & coulson 1986 , gieren , fouqu & gomez 1998 , and the discussion in c03 ) . based on the above considerations we adopt for star # 28114 @xmath4 = 0.08 @xmath3 0.02 mag .",
    "this leads to a distance modulus of 18.46 @xmath3 0.19 mag , where again the error is the sum in quadrature of the uncertainties in the reddening , absolute magnitude and photometry .",
    "we will now use star # 28114 along with the other @xmath0 scuti candidates detected in the lmc in an attempt to define the @xmath1 relation of the lmc @xmath0 scuti stars .",
    "we discuss first the list of short - period variables discovered in the ogle ii survey of the lmc .",
    "these stars are classified as `` other pulsating variables '' in soszyski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) catalog of the lmc rr lyrae stars .",
    "they are given in a table ( other_ogle.tab ) that does not appear directly in the paper and must be downloaded from the ogle internet archive for the lmc rr lyrae stars .",
    "the table lists 37 variables with periods shorter than @xmath710.5 d and generally around 0.2 d. the light curves of these 37 stars are generally poor , being some of the objects at the magnitude limit of ogle ii photometry .",
    "the authors provide intensity mean @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 magnitudes and corresponding de - reddened @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 values .",
    "the de - reddened magnitudes were computed assuming for each variable the reddening of the field where the star is located , of soszyski et al .",

    "in addition the periods and , where appropriate ( i.e. for stars suspected to be double - mode pulsators ) , also the secondary periods are given .",
    "the mean @xmath73 magnitudes of these 37 stars are plotted against @xmath79 in figure  5 .",
    "single - mode pulsators are shown as filled circles , double - mode pulsators are shown as filled triangles , stars vibrating in two periods in which the period ratio is @xmath80 0.76 are plotted as open squares . for all double - mode pulsators",
    "the shortest periods have been used in the plot .",
    "figure  5 shows a very large scatter . in an attempt to select the most likely @xmath0 scuti stars we cleaned the sample eliminating objects in figure  5 having p@xmath810.22 d scuti stars have similar absolute magnitude . with this cut off",
    "we have reduced the possibility of getting rr lyrae stars in our sample ] and/or brighter than @xmath8219 , being the average luminosity of the rr lyrae stars in the ogle ii survey : @xmath83 19.3 ( soszyski et al .",
    "we also eliminated the faintest star in the list : star 324548 ( ogle52417.16 - 692429.3 ) since its magnitudes lead to an unrealistic @xmath66 of 0.02 mag .",
    "the sample cleaned according to the above criteria includes 24 stars , they are listed in the upper portion of table  [ t : table2 ] .",
    "column 5 of the table gives the ogle ii mean @xmath73 magnitudes of these stars .",
    "df05 show that there are systematic differences between ogle and df05 photometries based on the comparison of a large number of stars ( about 6000 ) in common in the magnitude range from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "reasons for these differences are widely discussed in section 4.3 of df05 paper .",
    "df05 magnitudes are on average systematically slightly fainter than ogle s photometry for the same stars because df05 photometry is able to reach about 1.5 mag fainter and to resolve about 40% more stars stars than ogle ii in the same area , thanks to the higher performances to measure faint stars in crowded fields of the reduction procedures adopted by df05 ( daophot / allframe ) compared to ogle s ( dophot ) . at the luminosity level of the lmc @xmath0 scuti stars df05 photometry is about 0.06 mag fainter than ogle s .",
    "this difference decreases to about 0.04 for @xmath15 in the range from 15 to 18 mag ( see table 15 in df05 ) .",
    "since df05 @xmath15 photometry is generally more accurate and deeper than ogle s ( see upper panels of figure 25 in df05 ) we have adopted df05 photometric zero point , and have thus transformed ogle ii @xmath73 mean magnitudes using the transformation relations provided by df05 .",
    "corrected @xmath86 values are given in column 7 of table  [ t : table2 ] .    in order to identify the pulsation mode of the ogle stars in table  [ t : table2 ]",
    "it would be desirable to have precise light curves with a full frequency analysis available .",
    "unfortunately , such is not the case here .",
    "we instead , have been forced to try and identify the pulsation modes .",
    "we have used the following criteria : ( 1 ) stars with two frequencies and period ratios of p1/p0 @xmath27 0.76 - 0.775 are pulsating in the fundamental and first overtone modes , ( 2 ) the greatest concentration of data points in a @xmath73 - @xmath79 plot are likely the fundamental pulsators , ( 3 ) the stars falling near the lower envelope in the plot must be pulsating in the fundamental mode , ( 4 ) the stars should exhibit a @xmath87 relation with an expected cosmic scatter of @xmath88 @xmath27 0.09 magnitudes , ( 5 ) first and second overtone pulsators should lie @xmath27 0.3 mag and 0.6 mag above the fundamental pulsators in the @xmath73 - @xmath79 plot , respectively . on the basis of these criteria",
    "we have assigned the variable s pulsation modes ( see column 9 of table  [ t : table2 ] ) .",
    "they are subject to improvement when more precise data become available .",
    "in figure  6 we plot the corrected mean @xmath86 magnitudes of ogle ii cleaned sample using open circles for stars likely pulsating in the first or higher overtones and filled circles for stars pulsating in the fundamental mode .",

    "the four stars at 19.0@xmath89 19.4 mag and @xmath91 , are likely pulsating in the second overtone . since @xmath520.773 and @xmath92 0.805 ( see figure 5 of jurcsik et al .",
    "2006 ) they were fundamentalized assuming @xmath930.6223 and are also plotted as asterisks .",
    "the open triangle represents the position of the # 28114 discussed previously , according to its fundamentalized period .",

( 1997 ) on the basis of a sequence of nonlinear convective models at fixed mass and luminosity found that the first three radial modes are excited in these pulsators and that , at variance with current empirical classifications , moving from the second overtone to lower pulsational modes the amplitudes progressively decrease and the shape of the light curves becomes more sinusoidal , with low - amplitude pulsators , like our lmc @xmath0 scuti , either pulsating in the fundamental or in the first overtone mode .",
