    "in recent years , there have been some theoretical studies concerning the possibility to influence the flux motion in long josephson junctions by mean of geometry - induced or field - induced potentials .",
    "the most known example is the annular junction embedded in a spatially homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "as it is known @xcite , in this case a cosinusoidal potential is experienced by a flux quantum trapped in the junction when a spatially homogeneous magnetic field is applied parallel to the junction barrier .",
    "the origin of the potential is caused by the spatial variation of the radial component of the magnetic field that in this special geometry becomes sinusoidal .",
    "a field - induced sawtooth - like potential has been recently considered @xcite for experimental demonstration @xcite of ratchet effect in annular junctions .",
    "currently , modifications of the annular geometry , as the heart - shaped geometry @xcite are used to achieve a field - induced double - well potential for demonstration of fluxon quantum - bit and macroscopic quantum coherence phenomena .    to achieve potentials without the help of a magnetic field , the case of a nonuniform junction width",
    "has been theoretically addressed in recent years for linear @xcite as well as for annular @xcite geometries .",
    "theoretically , a geometry - induced potential related to the spatial variation of the junction width is expected .",
    "this potential corresponds to a force acting on the fluxons in the direction of the shrinking width .",
    "recently , @xcite ordinary josephson flux - flow oscillators @xcite have been modified adding to the classical overlap geometry @xcite unbiased pointed tails .",
    "this is expected to enhance the annichilation of the fluxons at the edges of the oscillator , with consequent reduction of fine structures in the ordinary velocity - matching step @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we experimentally address the existence of the geometrical force in nonuniform width junctions . to do this",
    ", we consider an exponentially shaped overlap junction with lateral current injection .",
    "the lateral current injection acts as a flux quanta generator , also in the absence of a magnetic field , while the unbiased shaped region should act as an accelerating region for both fluxons or antifluxons injected at one edge of the junction .",
    "if really present , the geometric force should allow to achieve a quite regular unidirectional flux flow motion in the junction , without the help of a magnetic field .",
    "this dynamical regime should be accounted for a branch in the current - voltage curve of the shaped junction .",
    "the demonstration of such branches in the current - voltage curves of shaped junctions we fabricated suggests that such a geometrical force is really experencied by the flux quanta .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we specialize the general model @xcite for a long junction with nonuniform width to our exponentially shaped junction with lateral current injection . in sec .",
    "iii the experimental results both in the absence of magnetic field and in the presence of magnetic field are presented and discussed with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "finally , main results are summarized in the conclusions .",

    "the lengths @xmath18 @xmath19and @xmath20 are chosen to be shorter than @xmath9 and such that @xmath21 to have equal biased areas .",
    "hence , the model for our exponentially shaped junction becomes    [ model ] @xmath22    where @xmath23 @xmath24 , and @xmath25 accounts for an external magnetic field applied in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "we remark that the chosen geometry reduces to the exponentially shaped in - line geometry @xcite in the case of left current injection with injection length @xmath26 much lower than @xmath27 in such a limit , the model becomes    [ modelin ] @xmath28    as first noted in ref .",
    ", a force that drags fluxons or antifluxons in the direction of the narrowing width is expected for our geometry .",

    "panel ( a ) of this figure refers to the case of current injected into the left edge , while        the panel ( b ) refers to the case of current injected into the right edge . in both cases an almost linear branch starting from a certain critical current and extending for a given current range is observed , but some qualitative differences exist between the two cases . as better seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , when current is injected into the left edge the branch starts to a lower critical current and is more regular than the branch achieved with current injected to the right edge .",
    "the observed behavior seems to be consistent with the idea that a geometrical force is effectively experienced by the fluxons in this geometry .",
    "when current of positive ( negative ) polarity is injected into the left edge , antifluxons ( fluxons ) will enucleate at this edge after a critical current value has been reached . from eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) these antifluxons are expected to be accelerated toward the other edge because of the geometrical force , so realizing a regular unidirectional flux motion .",
    "conversely , if the current is injected into the right edge , the antifluxons enucleated a this edge should overcome a force to travel toward the left edge .",
    "this should result in an irregular or chaotic flux motion .",
    "moreover , in the left current injection the geometrical force helps to start an antifluxon ( or fluxon ) motion , corresponding to a voltage in the i - v curve beyond a critical current value . in the right current injection",
    "such a force opposes the starting of the flux motion , so resulting in a larger critical current .",
    "we should remark that the quasi - linear branches reported in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] could remind the displaced linear slope branches sometimes reported for rectangular in - line or overlap geometries @xcite .",

    "the observed voltage spacing is consistent with the spacing of cavity mode resonances expected from physical dimensions of our junction , @xmath50 @xmath51 this is to be expected due to the open boundary condition at the edges .",
    "the antifluxons in the chain moving toward the right edge will be reflected as fluxons .",
    "if the dissipation @xmath4 is not too large , the antifluxons can have enough energy to travel toward the left edge as fluxons after the reflection , despite of the geometrical force opposing the motion .",
    "this mechanism can excite cavity mode resonances .",
    "however , for quite large dissipation one expect that the reflected motion would be more and more damped , and the excitation of cavity modes should be consequently damped . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) the i - v curve of the junction with @xmath52 is plotted for three different temperatures , corresponding to three different @xmath4 values .",

    "however , due to the absence of a force in the unbiased region , the flux motion is not very regular .",
    "here it is only the repulsion between flux quanta that tends to drive the flux toward the right edge .",
    "the resulting motion is quite noisy , as well as the calculated ac voltage at the right edge .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) the case of an exponentially shaped width ( @xmath55 ) is considered . in the simulation we used parameters similar to the ones estimated for the experimental curve in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . as it seen in the snapshot , now",
    "the presence of a force in the unbiased region makes the flux motion toward the right edge more regular , as well as the voltage signal at the right edge . in the snapshot four moving antifluxon",
    "are counted as present in the mean in the junction for the chosen bias point . by increasing the bias current ,",
    "more and more antifluxons can be injected in the junction , and the chain becomes more and more dense .",
    "correspondly , the voltage signal at the right edge becomes less impulsive and approaches a sinusoidal form .",
    "when the junction is completelly filled with antifluxons , a transition to a new dynamical regime , similar to a laminar phase flow @xcite is achieved . in the current - voltage curve",
    ", this transition corresponds to the switch from the flux flow branch toward the other resistive branch , beyond a critical current value . as in the experimental curve ,",
    "the small steps in the calculated flux flow branch are spaced of @xmath56 , the spacing ( in normalized units ) expected from cavity mode resonances excited from reflecting boundary conditions at the edges .",
    "as said above , the resonances can be damped by increasing the dissipation @xmath57 however , another mean to achieve this is to match the impedance of the fluxon chain with a load @xmath58 at the right edge . the matching is found possible @xcite for this geometry , conversely to the rectangular asymmetric in - line geometry .",
    "for our exponentially shaped junction the wave impedance is just the stationary velocity we have found above , @xmath59 this should be matched with a load of impedance @xmath60 numerical results for the case of a matched load are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) . as a result of the absence of reflections , the small steps typical of the unmatched case of fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) are now absent and the flux chain exhibits a very regular motion , as well as the voltage signal at the matched edge .",
    "this characteristic makes the exponentially shaped junction interesting as zero - magnetic field flux flow oscillator .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] there are shown numerical results for a junction with @xmath61 for the unmatched case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) the used parameters can account for the current - voltage curve at t=4.2 k in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) . in both cases",
    "as said above , in such a case the antifluxons are accelerated toward the asymptotic velocity @xmath63 so the matching condition is now @xmath64 in the snapshots shown in fig .  [",

    "the snapshots shows the instantaneous voltage and magnetic field profiles , and the voltage signal at the right edge of the junctions.,width=302 ]    instantaneous magnetic field .",
    "antifluxons in the chain are accelerated and , due to their relativistic nature , they are lorentz - contracted as the asymptotic velocity is approached .",
    "as for the case @xmath66 the matched junction exhibits a smooth flux - flow branch and the voltage signal at the right edge is very regular .      due to the lateral current injection and due to the existence of a preferred direction of motion , our exponentially shaped junction is expected to show a behavior in magnetic field even more strongly asymmetric with respect to the asymmetric rectangular in - line geometry .",
    "the calculated critical current as a function of the magnetic field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) for a junction with @xmath67 and @xmath55 .",

    "the almost complete absence of secondary lobes in the pattern means the almost complete absence of trapped flux in this kind of junction , an indication that the geometrical force helps to move fluxons just after their enucleation .",
    "figure [ fig6](b ) shows a global representation of calculated resonant steps achieved for normalized magnetic field values slightly larger than the critical value @xmath71 such a plot is obtained superimposing the curves corresponding to different values of magnetic field .",
    "two families of steps with two characteristic voltage spacing are recovered .",
    "the lower voltage spacing is the one expected for fiske mode resonances , @xmath72 , the larger one is about @xmath73 .",
    "the family of steps with larger voltage spacing appears in the same current range where the     by a magnetic field slightly larger than the critical field . in the inset the current voltage curve at b=2.4",
    "g is shown.,width=302 ]    flux flow branch is achieved in the absence of magnetic field . from numerical simulation",
    "it is seen that these steps with larger voltage spacing consists of cavity mode resonances excited by a fluxon chain and an antifluxon chain moving in opposite directions .",
    "in fact , for positive bias current an antifluxon chain moving toward the rigth edge is generated , while a positive magnetic field generate fluxons .",
    "these fluxons are pulled toward the left edge by the lorentz force associated to the positive bias current a this edge .",
    "antifluxons travelling toward the right generate a voltage with positive polarity that adds to the voltage of the fluxons traveling toward left .",
    "this accounts for the larger voltage spacing observed for the steps of this family .    for negative bias currents ,",
    "the fluxons generated by the positive magnetic field are pushed toward the right edge by the lorentz force associated to the negative bias current . moreover , also the fluxon chain injected at the left edge by the bias current moves toward the right , under the action of the geometrical force .",
    "the result is that an unidirectional motion toward the right edge tends to be achieved , with consequent damping of resonant steps accounting for cavity mode resonances . as seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , resonant steps are in fact virtually absent for negative current values .",
    "this peculiarity is observed also for larger magnetic values . for negative magnetic fields values ,",
    "the current - voltage curve show steps for negative bias current values , and no steps for positive bias values .",
    "in other words , the current - voltage curve reflects with respect to the origin when the sign of the magnetic field is inverted .    predicted strongly asymmetric magnetic field behavior summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is fully recovered in the experiment , as shown in fig .",
    "experimental data refer to the junction with @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) the steps are achieved for magnetic field values slightly larger than @xmath74 g , the critical field of the junction . in fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) we reported the modification of the flux flow branch induced by a low magnetic field , i.e. , lower than @xmath75 an asymmetric tunning of the branch is recovered .",
    "this can be easily understood as follows .",
    "we are using strongly left - edge - peaked current injection . in this case our junction can be also described as a shaped aysmmetric in - line junction , i.e. , with model eqs .",
    "( [ modelin ] ) .",
    "looking at the vortex generator term @xmath76 it is easily understood that a positive magnetic field cooperates with a negative bias current to inject fluxons in the junctions , while such a positive magnetic field opposes a positive current injecting antifluxons in to the junction .",
    "the result is that , for a given absolute value of the bias current , more solitons are present at negative polarities than at positive polarities , resulting in a voltage at negative polarity larger than the voltage at positive polarity , as it is in fact observed in the experimental curves of fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) .",
    "figure [ fig8](b ) shows the steps recorded in the junction for magnetic fields    . in the inset",
    "we show the voltage of the junction polarized at fixed current on the step as a function of the magnetic field.,width=302 ]    quite larger than @xmath75 the fine structures accounting for fiske modes are completely smeared out at @xmath77 g and a smooth step , similar to the velocity - matching step @xcite , with asymptotic voltage strictly proportional to @xmath78 is achieved .",
    "the proportionality between the voltage and the magnetic field is shown in the inset for a given biasing current .",
    "the velocity - matching step is found to exist beyond the current - voltage range of existence of the linear flux flow branch in zero field , i.e. , beyond @xmath79600 @xmath41v ( and up to 1500 @xmath41v ) and @xmath80 ma .",
    "this is consistent with the observation @xcite that the velocity matching step originates from a quasi - linear waves regime in the junction . in our case",
    "such a quasi - linear background is the laminar phase flow @xcite achieved beyond the current range typical of the zero - field flux - flow branch .",
    "summarizing , we have experimentally investigated the occurence of dynamical states in exponentially shaped overlap junctions with lateral current injection . in zero magnetic field , the lateral current injection acts as a fluxon or antifluxon chain generator and these chains can be accelerated by the geometrical force originating from the nonuniform width of the junction .",
    "the result is that a quite regular flux - flow motion , corresponding to a quasi - linear branch in the i - v curve of the junction , can be achieved in this kind of junction without the help of an external magnetic field .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations show that this kind of motion can be precisely matched to a load , a peculiarity that makes the zero field flux flow branch interesting for zero - field flux flow oscillators . in the presence of a magnetic field a rather asymmetric behavior",
    "is exhibited by the junction . for low magnetic fields an asymmetric tuning of the flux - flow branch",
    "is observed , for moderated magnetic field ordinary fiske modes steps are mixed with nonlinear cavity modes steps , and for quite large magnetic fields a single step similar to the velocity - matching step known for uniform width geometries is recovered .",
