    "in the last three decades lattice qcd has seen an impressive development into a reliable tool for obtaining non - perturbative results in hadron physics .",
    "however , for one important application , the study of qcd at finite density , the lattice formulation has so far not lived up to our expectations .",
    "the reason is that for non - zero chemical potential the fermion determinant is complex and can not be interpreted as a probability in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "various approaches to circumvent this problem were explored and the reviews at the annual lattice conferences provide a regular update @xcite .    an interesting approach to lattice systems with a complex action problem is to search for a mapping to alternative variables where the partition sum is a sum over real and positive contributions such that in terms of the new variables the complex action problem is gone . even for theories without a complex action problem an alternative representation of the partition sum could allow for improved monte carlo simulations with new algorithmic ideas .",
    "a prominent simple example is the worm algorithm @xcite for spin systems such as the ising model which is based on a representation of the partition sum in terms of closed loops of z@xmath1 flux .    in recent years",
    "several examples for new algorithmic approaches that are based on transformations of lattice field theories to new variables were presented for a wide range of applications : low dimensional systems @xcite , strongly coupled lattice field theories @xcite , systems with 4-fermi interactions @xcite , effective theories for qcd @xcite , scalar field theories @xcite and u(1 ) lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "similar in spirit , simulations directly based on the trotter formula for lattice field theories in hamiltonian approach were explored @xcite .",
    "many interesting conceptual and algorithmic ideas emerged in these papers and systems that previously were not fully accessible to monte carlo simulations can now be explored .",
    "so far the studies with alternative variables ( dual variables ) were mostly concerned with flux - like structures living on links , with the exception of the studies @xcite of pure u(1 ) gauge theory where the dual variables are surfaces . in theories where gauge fields interact with matter fields , such as qcd , qed or gauge - higgs systems",
    "a dual representation will contain both : surfaces for the gauge fields and fluxes for matter fields which serve as boundaries for open surfaces .    in this article",
    "we develop the idea of using dual representations for simulations of lattice field theories further and explore dual representations for the z@xmath0 gauge - higgs systems .",
    "this is a first step towards systems which couple gauge- and matter fields and where surfaces interacting with fluxes appear in the dual representation . as a matter of fact",
    "all abelian gauge - higgs theories have a dual representation similar to the one we here discuss for the z@xmath0 case and the techniques presented here can be adapted to other abelian cases .",
    "the choice to use the gauge group z@xmath0 in this exploratory study is partly motivated by the possibility to couple a chemical potential and to explore finite density physics for z@xmath0 , which as the center group of su(3 ) plays an interesting role in the phenomenology of qcd . at zero temperature",
    "we explore the various phase transitions as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "the main goal of this work is to develop further alternative representations of lattice field theories and their use in monte carlo simulations .    in the next section",
    "we derive the dual representation of the partition sum in terms of fluxes and surfaces . in section iii",
    "we discuss observables and develop our strategy for the monte carlo simulation in terms of the dual variables . in section iv we first compare the dual simulation of pure z@xmath0 lattice gauge theory and the full system at @xmath2 to results from a monte carlo calculation in the conventional approach .",

    "let us now come to the more interesting case of finite density . here conventional simulations fail and the full potential of the dual approach can be unveiled .",
    "before we start with the presentation of monte carlo results we first discuss some characteristic features of the dual representation at finite density .",
    "the dual representation of the z@xmath0 gauge - higgs model uses two sets of degrees of freedom , the plaquette occupation numbers @xmath56 and the fluxes @xmath32 . for the analysis of the mechanisms that drive the systems at finite density it is useful to think a little bit about the dynamics of the dual variables , and this subsection",
    "is devoted to that task .",
    "the dual degrees of freedom assume values in @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath118 and @xmath119 . a trivial value of the plaquette occupation number , i.e. , @xmath88 comes with a boltzmann factor of @xmath120 ( compare ( [ z3gaugeweight ] ) ) , while non - trivial values @xmath121 give rise to a factor of @xmath122 ( see ( [ aux3 ] ) for the definition of @xmath59 ) .",

    "many @xmath123 have a much higher entropy and ( as always ) the interplay of entropy and boltzmann factor gives rise to the first order transition of the pure gauge theory discussed in subsection iv - a .",
    "the corresponding observables @xmath64 and @xmath65 are simple functions of the plaquette occupation numbers and their fluctuations .",
    "we stress at this point that both observables have a @xmath66-dependent additive term ( compare ( [ obs1z3 ] ) ) . for the plaquette expectation value",
    "the additive term is given by @xmath59 , and @xmath64 is non - vanishing for @xmath124 even when all plaquette occupation numbers @xmath56 are trivial , since @xmath125 for @xmath124 .",
    "similar to the plaquette occupation numbers , the spatial flux variables @xmath126 , have a boltzmann factor of 1 for @xmath127 and a boltzmann factor @xmath128 for @xmath129 ( see ( [ z3gaugeweight ] ) ) .",
    "as for the case of the plaquette occupation numbers , we find for the @xmath32-variables that trivial values of the spatial fluxes are preferred by the boltzmann factor .",
    "the temporal flux variables @xmath76 are connected with the boltzmann factors @xmath130 with @xmath131 defined in ( [ aux2 ] ) .",

    "we use red thick lines with arrows for the @xmath32 flux variables and blue squares ( with a circle showing the orientation ) for the plaquette occupation numbers @xmath56 .",
    "the rules for admissible configurations dictate that at each site the total flux from the @xmath32-variables has to be a multiple of 3 .",

    "we show a few low - lying excitations of the z@xmath0 gauge - higgs model in the dual representation .",
    "thick red lines oriented with arrows are used for the @xmath32-flux and filled blue squares for non - vanishing plaquette occupation numbers , and the circles in the squares indicate the orientation of the plaquette according to the sign of the corresponding plaquette occupation number @xmath87 .",
    "the simplest excitations ( the lhs .",
    "diagram in fig .",
    "[ excitations ] ) are an occupied plaquette surrounded by flux . at each link",
    "the flux is compensated by the plaquette . occupied plaquettes with suitable relative orientation",
    "can be attached to each other ( see the example in the center diagram ) . at the link where they are joined the flux is absent and the contributions from the plaquette occupation numbers compensate . finally the excitation in the rhs .",
    "diagram makes use of the fact that flux and plaquette numbers need to vanish only modulo 3 .",
    "three units of flux emerge from a site , travel in time and then terminate at another site .",
    "the constraints are again saturated with plaquettes , such that at the central temporal link three plaquettes together obey the constraint .",
    "this excitation , which resembles a baryon , carries three factors of @xmath135 and thus is enhanced by the chemical potential .    without chemical potential the boltzmann factor for the excitations shown in fig .",
    "[ excitations ] follows a simple rule : the more non - vanishing plaquette occupation numbers @xmath56 and fluxes @xmath32 a configuration has , the lower is the corresponding boltzmann weight , and the dynamics discussed in subsection iv - b .  for the full z@xmath0 gauge higgs system at @xmath2 is again determined by the interplay of entropy and boltzmann weight .",
    "the situation is more complex when the chemical potential @xmath5 is turned on .",
    "then the weights for the temporal flux variables @xmath76 obey @xmath132 and the probability for positive temporal fluxes is increased relative to the probability for negative fluxes . in the lhs .",
    "plots of fig .",
    "[ muplots ] we show the ratios @xmath136 and @xmath137 as a function of @xmath5 using @xmath113 .",
    "the metropolis probabilities for accepting a step from @xmath138 to @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively are given by @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we see that for all @xmath141 we have @xmath142 and temporal fluxes @xmath133 are always favored over negative ones . for values of @xmath5 up to @xmath143",
    "the discrepancy between @xmath136 and @xmath137 remains large and the non - zero chemical potential pumps positive temporal @xmath32-flux into the system .",
    "however , this @xmath32-flux has to be compensated by plaquettes which costs boltzmann weight and dampens the increase of temporal flux with @xmath133 .",
    "this interplay between the pumping with @xmath5 and the damping by the boltzmann factor of the plaquette variables can give rise to a phase transition at some critical value of @xmath5 , when the positive temporal @xmath32-flux starts to dominate and drags along the plaquette occupation numbers .",
    "in the next subsection we will see that this is indeed the case for suitable values of the couplings .",
    "it is , however , important to note that for @xmath144 the two ratios @xmath136 and @xmath137 start to approach each other again and they both have limit 1 for large @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that at large values of @xmath5 the probabilities for temporal fluxes @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are equal , and the chemical potential does not favor an orientation for the @xmath76 .",
    "thus for sufficiently large @xmath5 the boltzmann factor of the plaquette occupation numbers may again dominate the physics .",
    "this raises an interesting question that then has to be answered in this region : how can the particle number density @xmath71 keep growing with @xmath5 if the weights @xmath130 that drive the @xmath5-dependence for small @xmath5 become degenerate at large @xmath5 ?",
    "the answer lies in the flux representation of @xmath71 given in ( [ obs2z3 ] ) : the numbers @xmath148 , for temporal links with @xmath149 are weighted with the factors @xmath150 .",

    "we found similarly good asymptotic behavior also for the weak coupling results shown in fig .",
    "11 , but since there we use a smaller interval on the x - axis this is not entirely obvious from the plots .",
    "it is a remarkable feature of the dual representation that part of the behavior of observables ( e.g. , the asymptotic behavior in the above example ) is already encoded in the expansion factors of the partition sum and the representation of the observables in terms of dual variables .",
    "let us now come to the numerical results at finite density .",
    "we numerically analyzed the finite density behavior for both values of @xmath19 that were considered in section iv , i.e. , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "for the @xmath114 case we did not find transitions as a function of @xmath5 and thus do not present the corresponding results in this exploratory study .",
    "instead we focus on @xmath113 and study the system for two couplings on both sides of the transition located at @xmath105 .",

    "the reason for the large @xmath158 is that we want to study the system at zero temperature .",
    "although with @xmath158 the temperature @xmath159 in lattice units is not exactly zero , this value is much smaller than any other involved scale and constitutes a good approximation of @xmath160 .",
    "we consider the full set of observables discussed in section iii , i.e. , in addition to the plaquette @xmath64 and its susceptibility @xmath65 we now also analyze the particle number density @xmath71 and its susceptibility @xmath72 .         in fig .",

    "the data for @xmath162 and @xmath163 fall on top of each other and only the @xmath161 data show a slight discrepancy near @xmath164 due to finite volume effects ( the transition zone is shifted towards a slightly smaller @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath165 the system undergoes a first order transition : both first derivatives , the plaquette expectation value @xmath64 and the particle number density @xmath71 show a clear discontinuity .",

    "this trend towards visible finite size effects continues when using @xmath167 ( data not shown ) .",

    "we conclude that we reliably describe the situation at zero temperature , and that for @xmath113 and @xmath154 the system undergoes a very narrow first order transition at @xmath171 .",
    "from the fact that the plaquette undergoes such a drastic change at @xmath166 we conclude that the gauge dynamics plays an important role in the transition .",
