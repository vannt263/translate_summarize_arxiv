    "the possibility of quantum - gravity - induced in - vacuo dispersion , an energy dependence of the travel times of ultrarelativistic particles from a given source to a given detector , has been motivated in several studies ( see _ e.g. _ refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "part of the interest in this possibility comes from the fact that it is a rare example of candidate quantum - gravity effect that could lead to observably large manifestations , even if , as it appears to be safe to assume , its characteristic length scale is of the order of the minute planck length ( inverse of the planck energy scale @xmath0 ) or anyway not much larger than that .",
    "the best opportunity so far studied for such experimental tests is provided by observations of grbs @xcite , which set up for us a sort of race among photons of different energies and ( probably @xcite ) neutrinos of different energies , all emitted within a relatively small time window . the fact that our understanding of the mechanisms producing grbs remains preliminary",
    "is a challenge , since any given time - of - arrival difference among two particles can in principle always be attributed to the emission mechanism , but this can be compensated by suitable techniques of statistical analysis .    for more than a decade",
    "the analyses of grb data from the in - vacuo - dispersion perspective were done considering only photons and focusing on what could be tentatively inferred from each single grb .",
    "recently , thanks mainly to the icecube telescope , it became possible to contemplate the possibility that we might be observing also some grb neutrinos affected by in - vacuo dispersion ; moreover , for grb photons the abundance of observations cumulatively obtained by the fermi telescope reached the level sufficient for attempting to perform statistical analyses over the whole collection of fermi - observed grbs . some of us were involved in the first studies using icecube data for searching for grb - neutrino in - vacuo - dispersion candidates  @xcite .",
    "intriguing statistical analyses of in - vacuo dispersion over the whole collection of fermi - observed grbs were perfomed in a series of studies by bo - qiang ma and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino studies of refs .",
    "@xcite led to exposing a feature in the icecube neutrino data which could plausibly be a manifestation of in - vacuo dispersion .",
    "the possibility that this feature could be the result of background neutrinos just accidentally arranging themselves as if they were grb neutrinos affected by in vacuo dispersion was considered using statistical tools of analysis , finding that it would be  very untypical \" for background neutrinos to produce accidentally such a pronounced in - vacuo dispersion feature .",
    "the grb - photon studies reported in refs .",
    "@xcite also led to exposing a feature which could be a manifestation of in - vacuo dispersion . while this feature for grb photons is certainly striking , as observed most convincingly in ref .",
    "@xcite , there was so far no attempt to characterize quantitatively its statistical significance .",
    "the main objective of the study we are here reporting is to characterize the statistical significance of the feature exposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for photons , and to show that this feature is surprisingly consistent with the feature exposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for neutrinos of much higher energies ( the relevant photons have energies of the order of 10 gev , while the neutrinos have energies of the order of 100 tev ) .",
    "we also offer some preliminary observations which might become relevant if any of the features here contemplated find greater support as more data are accrued , concerning the possible interpretation of such features as manifestations of ( so far unknown ) astrophysical mechanisms , rather than as manifestations of in - vacuo dispersion .",
    "the class of scenarios we intend to contemplate finds motivation in some much - studied models of spacetime quantization ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and references therein ) and , for the type of data analyses we are interested in , has the implication that the time needed for a ultrarelativistic particle to travel from a given source to a given detector receives a quantum - spacetime correction , here denoted with @xmath1 .",
    "we focus on the class of scenarios whose predictions for energy ( @xmath2 ) dependence of @xmath1 can all be described in terms of the formula ( working in units with the speed - of - light scale  @xmath3 \" set to 1 ) @xmath4 here the redshift- ( @xmath5-)dependent @xmath6 carries the information on the distance between source and detector , and it factors in the interplay between quantum - spacetime effects and the curvature of spacetime . as usually done in the relevant literature @xcite we take for @xmath6 the following form : ) is by far the most studied scenario , some alternatives to ( [ dz ] ) are also under consideration @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote , as usual , respectively the cosmological constant , the hubble parameter and the matter fraction , for which we take the values given in ref.@xcite .",
    "with @xmath11 we denote the planck scale ( @xmath12 ) while the values of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 in ( [ main ] ) characterize the specific scenario one intends to study . in particular ,",
    "in ( [ main ] ) we used the notation  @xmath15 \" to reflect the fact that @xmath14 parametrizes the size of quantum - uncertainty ( fuzziness ) effects .",
    "instead the parameter @xmath13 characterizes systematic effects : for example in our conventions for positive @xmath13 and @xmath16 a high - energy particle is detected systematically after a low - energy particle ( if the two particles are emitted simultaneously ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 can take different values for different types of particles @xcite , and it is of particular interest for our study that in particular for neutrinos some arguments have led to the expectation of an helicity dependence of the effects ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore even when focusing only on neutrinos one should contemplate four parameters , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( with the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 referring of course to the helicity ) .",
    "analogous considerations apply to photons and their polarization @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 are to be determined experimentally . when non - vanishing , they are expected to take values somewhere in a neighborhood of 1 , but values as large as @xmath24 are plausible if the solution to the quantum - gravity problem is somehow connected , as some arguments suggest @xcite , with the unification of non - gravitational forces , while values smaller than 1 find support in some renormalization - group arguments ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we find convenient to introduce a  distance - rescaled energy \" @xmath25 defined as and a  distance - rescaled energy \" @xmath25 , in refs .",
    "@xcite , which focused on neutrinos , the analysis was set up in terms of correlations between energy and a  distance - rescaled time delay \" @xmath26 .",
    "the two setups are evidently equivalent , but the one we adopt here is best suited for handling the possibility of a ( roughly-)systematic time offset at the source ( see later ) . for the values of @xmath1 that are relevant for the neutrino part of the analysis this possibility of a time offset",
    "has a negligible role , and therefore the two setups are actually equally convenient , but for part of the analysis based on photons it is advantageous to set up the analysis in terms of correlations between @xmath1 and a  distance - rescaled energy \" @xmath25 . ]",
    "@xmath27 so that ( [ main ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28 this reformulation of ( [ main ] ) allows to describe the relevant quantum - spacetime effects , which in general depend both on redshift and energy , as effects that depend exclusively on energy , through the simple expedient of focusing on the relationship between @xmath1 and energy when the redshift has a certain chosen value , which in particular we chose to be @xmath29 . if one measures a certain @xmath1 and the redshift @xmath5 of the relevant grb is well known , then one gets a firm determination of @xmath25 by simply rescaling the measured @xmath2 by the factor @xmath30 . and",
    "even when the redshift of the relevant grb is not known accurately one will be able to convert a measured @xmath2 into a determined @xmath25 with accuracy governed by how much one is able to still assume about the redshift of the relevant grb . in particular ,",
    "even just the information on whether a grb is long or short can be converted into at least a very rough estimate of redshift .",
    "eq.([maintwo ] ) , which follows the strategy of analysis proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , is ideally structured to handle the possibility that there be a ( roughly ) systematic time offset at emission between the time of emission of the low - energy particles used as reference ( we shall later take as reference the time of observation of the first peak of the low - energy - gamma - ray component of a grb ) and the higher - energy particle of interest .",
    "such an astrophysical mechanism for time offset at the source , would imply , within the modelization we are assuming for the quantum - spacetime effects , that @xmath1 is not exactly proportional to @xmath25 , since the observed @xmath1 would receive both a contribution from the quantum - spacetime effects given by the right - hand side of eq.([maintwo ] ) and a contribution due to the time offset at the source .",
    "this latter contribution can be described as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the time offset at the source and the factor @xmath33 takes into account time dilatation . following refs .",
    "@xcite these observations can be fruitfully used to replace eq.([maintwo ] ) with @xmath34 notice that in allowing for the mentioned possibility of a time offset at the source we also found appropriate to set up our equation as a relationship between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , so that the term involving @xmath32 is just a constant contribution , redshift independent and energy independent .",
    "later , in our graphs showing @xmath35 versus @xmath36 , this will facilitate the visualization of @xmath32 .",
    "we stress that here , just like in refs .",
    "@xcite , we shall not allow for different values of @xmath32 for different photons for different photons one could never test the in - vacuo - dispersion hypothesis , since any measured value of @xmath1 could always be attributed to a corresponding value of @xmath32 at the source . ] .",
    "we just allow for one value of @xmath32 valid for all photons of all grbs in the analysis , and we shall show that the present data situation fits rather nicely this apparently simplistic assumption .",
    "as stressed above , the main objective of the study we are here reporting is to characterize the statistical significance of the in - vacuo - dispersion feature exposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for photons , and to show that this feature is surprisingly consistent with the feature exposed in refs .",
    "@xcite for neutrinos .",
    "a quantitative characterization of the statistical significance of the in - vacuo - dispersion feature found for neutrinos was already given in ref .",
    "@xcite , so we shall not have new results about that here , but it is still valuable for our purposes to summarize the main steps of that analysis .",
    "this will also give us a chance to arrange the presentation in terms of correlations between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite the analysis was arranged in terms of correlations between energy and a  distance - rescaled time - of - arrival difference \" .",
    "these two arrangements of the analysis are evidently equivalent for the neutrino case and @xmath38 . ] , but it is a good preparation for the later discussion of the photon case to have the discussion of neutrinos arranged in terms of correlations between @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    for the neutrino case a crucial role is played by the criteria used for selecting some grb - neutrino candidates .",
    "this is not at all an easy task since the present situation is such that at best we can catch a single neutrino from a whole grb .",
    "moreover , in testing the hypothesis of in - vacuo dispersion , we must allow for a sizable time - of - observation difference between the neutrino and the first peak in fermi s gbm .",
    "in fact , at the scales of interest for this neutrino analysis , involving in particular neutrinos with energy of order 100 tev , in - vacuo dispersion could produce values of @xmath1 of anything between a few hours and a couple of days .",
    "of course such criteria for selecting grb - neutrino candidates will involve a temporal window ( how large can the @xmath1 be in order for us to consider a icecube event as a potential grb - neutrino candidate ) and some criteria of directional selection ( how well the directions estimated for the icecube event and for the grb should agree in order for us to consider that icecube event as a potential grb - neutrino candidate ) . a previous more preliminary analysis ( based on icecube data from june 2008 to may 2010 )",
    "had tentatively put in focus a range of values of @xmath39 ( for our eq.([main ] ) somewhere in the range between 10 and 20 , and this we used in refs .",
    "@xcite ( based on icecube data from june 2010 to may 2014 ) to choose a temporal window large enough to accommodate the corresponding size of the effects .",
    "we took a temporal window of 3 days , and focused on icecube events with energy between 60 tev and 500 tev .",
    "widening the range of energies up to , say , 1000 tev would have imposed us a temporal window of about 6 days , rendering even more severe one of the key challenges for this sort of analysis , which is the one of multiple grb candidate partners for a single icecube event . as directional criteria for the selection of grb - neutrino candidates we considered the signal direction pdf depending on the space angle difference between grb and neutrino : @xmath40 , a two dimensional circular gaussian whose standard deviation is @xmath41 , asking the pair composed by the neutrino and the grb to be at angular distance compatible within a 2@xmath42 region .    a key observation for our analysis ( based on the corresponding observation made in our ref .",
    "@xcite ) is that whenever @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 do not vanish one should expect on the basis of ( [ mainnew ] ) a correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath38 .    our data set",
    "@xcite is for four years of operation of icecube @xcite , from june 2010 to may 2014 .",
    "since the determination of the energy of the neutrino plays such a crucial role in our analysis we include only icecube  shower events \" ( for  track events \" the reconstruction of the neutrino energy is far more problematic and less reliable @xcite ) .",
    "we have 21 such events within our 60 - 500 tev energy window , and we find that 9 of them fit our requirements for candidate grb neutrinos .",
    "the properties of these 9 candidates that are most relevant for our analysis are summarized in table 1 and figure 1 .    ) , while black points correspond to  early neutrinos \" ( @xmath44 ) . ]    as visible in table 1 , for some icecube events our selection criteria produce multiple grb - neutrino candidates . in ref.@xcite",
    "we handled this issue of multiple candidates by focusing on the case that provides the highest correlation .",
    "another issue reflected by table 1 comes from the fact that for only 3 of the grbs involved in this analysis the redshift is known .",
    "we must handle only one short grb of unknown redshift , and we assume for it a redshift of 0.6 , which is a rather reasonable rough estimate for a short grb .",
    "our 9 grb - neutrino candidates marked by an asterisk in table 1 include 8 long grbs , 2 of which have known redshift , and we assign to the other 6 long grbs the average @xmath45 of those two values of redshift ( @xmath46 ) .    in figure 1",
    "it is striking that the correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath38 gets stronger at higher energies .",
    "interestingly , as observed in our ref.@xcite , this too fits the expectations of some quantum - spacetime models : as stressed in particular in ref.@xcite , in some of these quantum - spacetime models neutrinos can undergo processes of  neutrino splitting \" , and in turn this could plausibly @xcite affect a in - vacuo - dispersion study such as ours just in the way of rendering the correlation weaker at lower energies .",
    "while this was worth mentioning , we shall here prudently not take it into account : we shall ignore neutrino splitting and handle all our 9 grb - neutrino candidates on the same footing .",
    "the correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath38 for the 9 grb - neutrino candidates highlighted in fig.1 is of and @xmath38 .",
    "these two types of correlation studies are based on two equations which are equivalent to each other , one obtained from the other by simply dividing both members of the equation by the same function of redshift . therefore in the ideal case of an infinite amount of data the indications emerging from the two types of correlation studies would be exactly coincident , but only 9 data points intervene in our analysis , spread over a wide range of values of redshift , and this results in the ( however small ) difference between 0.951 and 0.866 . ]",
    "this is a strikingly high value of correlation but in itself does not provide what is evidently the most interesting quantity here of interest , which must be some sort of  false alarm probability \" : how likely it would be to have accidentally data with such good agreement with the expectations of the quantum - spacetime models here contemplated ?",
    "we proposed in ref.@xcite that for these purposes one could estimate how often a sample composed exclusively of background neutrinos would produce accidentally 9 or more grb - neutrino candidates with correlation comparable to ( or greater than ) those we found in data .",
    "we did this by performing @xmath47 randomizations of the times of detection of the 21 icecube neutrinos relevant for our analysis , keeping their energies and directions fixed , and for each of these time randomizations we redo the analysis just as if they were real data .",
    "our observable is a time - energy correlation and by randomizing the times we get a robust estimate of how easy ( or how hard ) it is for a sample composed exclusively of background neutrinos to produce accidentally a certain correlation result .",
    "also in the analysis of these fictitious data obtained by randomizing the detection times of the neutrinos we handle cases with neutrinos for which there is more than one possible grb partner by maximizing the correlation , in the sense already discussed above for the true data .",
    "we ask how often this time - randomization procedure produces 9 or more grb - neutrino candidates with correlation @xmath48 , and remarkably we find that this happens only in 0.11@xmath49 of cases .",
    "having correlation as high as 0.866 ( and false alarm probability of 0.11@xmath49 ) is particularly striking considering that surely at least some of our 9 grb - neutrino candidates are just background neutrinos accidentally fitting our criteria for the selection of grb - neutrino candidates .",
    "this can be straightforwardly deduced by observing that out of the 21 neutrinos in our sample , since indeed only 9 turned out to fit our requirements for grb - neutrino candidates , there are at least 12 neutrinos which are background ) is correct they are to be considered as background since they do not fit our selection criteria , and of course those 12 neutrinos are background also if eq.([main ] ) is not correct ( in that case all the 21 events are not grb neutrinos ) . ] .",
    "we can therefore ask how likely it would have been for one or more of those 12 neutrinos to accidentally appear to be grb neutrinos of the type we are looking for .",
    "this can be estimated by randomizing the times of those 12 neutrinos .",
    "of course , if , say , it is likely that 3 of those neutrinos could appear as grb neutrinos , we will assume that a proportionate number of our 9 grb - neutrino candidates are background .",
    "details on this line of reasoning are given in ref .",
    "important for us here is that this line of reasoning leads to the conclusion that it is very likely that at least 3 of our 9 grb - neutrino candidates are background .",
    "this renders somewhat striking the fact that , in spite of these contributions by background neutrinos , we found a value of correlation as high as 0.866 .    concerning our notion of  false alarm probability \" this deduction about",
    "the role played by background neutrinos may suggest a somewhat different strategy of analysis  @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate this by taking as working assumption that 3 among our 9 grb - neutrino candidates surely are background .",
    "we can then exploratively assume that the 6-plet of  true \" grb neutrinos is the maximum - correlation 6-plet among the 6-plets obtainable from our 9 candidates , and take as reference for the analysis the value of correlation found for this maximum - correlation 6-plet , which is 0.995 .",
    "one can then define a false alarm probability based on how frequently simulated data , obtained by randomizing the times of detection of all the 21 neutrinos in our sample , include a 6-plet of candidates with correlation greater or equal to the value of 0.995 found for the best 6-plet in the real data ( so , if , say , a given time randomization produces 11 candidates one would assign to the randomization a value of correlation given by the highest correlation found by considering all possible choices of 6 out of the 11 candidates ) .",
    "we find that this false alarm probability is of 0.6@xmath49 .",
    "having reviewed briefly the  case for in - vacuo dispersion for neutrinos \" , and the characterization of its statistical significance provided in our ref .",
    "@xcite , we are ready to proceed with our analysis of the  case for in - vacuo dispersion for photons \" , emerging from the investigations reported in refs .  @xcite . for this photon case , while ref .",
    "@xcite convincingly characterized the relevant feature as striking , there was so far no characterization of the statistical significance , so one of our main objectives here is to provide such a characterization .    the analyses reported by ma and collaborators in refs .",
    "@xcite focus on the highest - energy photons among those observed for grbs by the fermi telescope , and implements some time - window selection criteria .",
    "evidently , in spite of the many differences between the two contexts , there are challenges in this sort of analysis of grb photons , which are rather similar to the challenges faced in the analysis of candidate grb neutrinos reported above .",
    "we find appropriate to here contemplate not only the energy - window and time - window criteria adopted by ma and collaborators but also to propose some alternative criteria of our own , which ( while keeping close to the criteria introduced by ma and collaborators ) we feel might be a natural alternative to be considered as this research program further advances , especially as new data are accumulated .",
    "ma and collaborators focus on grb photons observed within 90 seconds of the first peak in the gbm and with observed energy greater than 10 gev . in our alternative criteria",
    "we choose to specify the time window by mainly exploiting the fact that , as already observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a surprisingly high percentage of the photons selected by the criteria of ma and collaborators are consistent with roughly the same value of the time offset at the source @xmath32 .",
    "we attempt to exploit this aspect in our time - window selection criteria by essentially characterizing the time window in terms of emission times , rather than observed times .",
    "we require that at the source the time of emission of our selected photons be consistent with an offset with respect to the time of emission of the first gbm peak of up to 20 seconds , but of course also allowing in addition for a sizeable range of effects possibly due to in - vacuo dispersion . when expressed in terms of the difference @xmath1 between the time of observation of the relevant photon and the time of observation of the first gbm peak , our time selection criterion takes the form @xmath50 here the @xmath51 are our mentioned window on @xmath32 , while the parameter we fix at @xmath52 allows for in - vacuo - dispersion effects of amount roughly comparable to the corresponding range of effects probed by ma and collaborators .",
    "the main difference here is that our time window has the same quantitative interpretation for all grbs when described in terms of emission times at the source , but when expressed as a window on observed times it depends on the redshift of the grb .",
    "the 90 seconds of redshift - independent observed - time window adopted by ma and collaborators roughly coincide with our window on observed times at redshift of 1 . for grbs at redshift greater than 1 ( where both time dilatation of the offset and the possible in - vacuo dispersion would produce bigger effects on the time of observation ) our eq.([timeselect ] ) allows for an observed - time window larger than 90 seconds , while for grbs at redshift smaller than 1 it allows for an observed - time window smaller than 90 seconds .    for what concerns our window on photon energies ,",
    "consistently with our focus on properties at the source ( rather than observed properties ) , we require that our selected photons be emitted at the source with energy greater than 40 gev .",
    "so in terms of observed energy our window is @xmath53 , an alternative to the 10-gev redshift - independent observed - energy window of ma and collaborators .",
    "we picked 40 gev as our cut on the energy at the source because the selection process for this choice gives results rather close to those obtained with the cut at 10 gev of observed energy adopted by ma and collaborators .    at the present time",
    "( as confirmed by our analysis ) there is no evidence that our criteria might be more advantageous than those of ma and collaborators .",
    "we are only proposing them as an alternative which might play a role as this research program advances . accordingly , while we keep at center stage our proposed criteria , in this manuscript we shall also report some results that we obtained using the selection criteria of ma and collaborators .",
    "an important final remark on selection criteria concerns redshifts . for our neutrino analysis it was possible , as shown above , to allow for grb - neutrino candidates for which the grb redshift had not been measured .",
    "we expect , as argued more extensively in ref.@xcite , that by using as reference some estimated average value of redshifts for long and short grbs observed in neutrinos we should eventually , as more data is accrued , reach conclusive findings , in spite of handling grbs which , for the most part , have no precise redshift assignment .",
    "such conclusive findings would have been reached faster in presence of more measured values of redshift , but without such measured values the analysis still works in the long run .",
    "we believe , however , that for the analogous photon analyses the role of redshift measurements must be handled differently .",
    "a challenge for this sort of photon analyses is that the size of the conjectured effects , often of a few seconds , is comparable to the time scales of the astrophysical mechanisms at work in a grb .",
    "any eventual in - vacuo dispersion effect would have to be deduced finely within the sort of  background noise \" produced by the ( largely unknown ) mechanisms that cause the specific time variability of a given grb . as a result",
    "we propose that in - vacuo - dispersion photon analyses should confine themselves to grbs of measured redshift .",
    "also ma and collaborators rather strictly adopt this attitude toward redshifts , though they have handled cases where the grb redshift had been guessed on the basis of some theoretical argument but had not been measured .",
    "we shall assume that it is safer for photon analyses to focus strictly on grbs on measured redshift .",
    "we show in table 2 and figure 2 the 11 fermi - telescope photons selected by the time window of our eq.([timeselect ] ) and our requirement of an energy of at least 40 gev at emission .",
    "the fact that our criteria are to a large extent compatible with the criteria of ma and collaborators is also suggested by figure 2 : all our 11 photons were also selected by ma and collaborators ; the only difference is that 2 of the photons selected by ma and collaborators are not picked up by our criteria .",
    "these 2 additional photons are also shown in figure 2 and table 2 .",
    "the content of figure 2 , as already efficaciously stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is rather striking .",
    "following ma and collaborators , we notice that all 13 photons ( the 11 picked up by our criteria , plus the two additional ones picked up by the criteria of ma and collaborators ) are well consistent with the same value of @xmath54 , upon allowing for only 3 values of @xmath32 .",
    "we shall not however attempt to quantify the statistical significance of this more complex thesis based on 3 values of @xmath32 : evidently the most striking feature is that 8 of our 11 photons ( 9 of the 13 photons of ma and collaborators ) are all compatible with the same value of @xmath54 and @xmath32 .",
    "this sets up a rather easy question that one can investigate statistically : if there is no in - vacuo dispersion , and therefore the correlation shown by the data is just accidental , how likely it would be for such 11 photons to include 8 that line up so nicely ?     and @xmath38 .",
    "gray points are for the 12th and 13th entries in table 2 ( photons picked up by the criteria of ma and collabroators , but not by our criteria ) . the strikingly visible feature of 8 black points ( plus 1 gray point ) falling nicely on a straight line",
    "is also highlighted in figure by the presence of a best - fit line ( which however we find appropriate to discuss in detail only later , in section v ) . ]",
    "we address this question quantitatively by first computing the correlation of the 8 among our 11 photons that line up nicely in figure 2 , finding that this correlation is 0.9959 .",
    "we then estimate an associated  false alarm probability \"  @xcite by performing simulations in which ( while keeping their energy fixed at the observed value ) we randomize , within the time window specified by our time - selection criterion , the time delay of each of our 11 high - energy photons with respect to the gbm peak of the relevant grb , and we assign to each of these randomizations a value of correlation given by the maximum value of correlation found by taking in all possible ways 8 out of the 11 photons .",
    "we find that these simulated values of correlation are @xmath55 only in 0.0013@xmath49 of cases , about 1 chance in 100000 .",
    "we stress that this impressive quantification of the statistical significance of the feature exposed by ma and collaborators does not depend on the fact that we adopted our own novel selection criteria . for this purpose",
    "we redo the analysis including also the 2 photons that should be included according to the criteria of ma and collaborators .",
    "in this case we have 9 out of 13 photons that line up very nicely .",
    "the value of correlation found for those 9 photons is 0.9961 .",
    "we then perform simulations in which we randomize the time of observation of all the 13 photons within the time window specified by the time - selection criterion of ma and collaborators and to each of these randomizations we assign a value of correlation given by the maximum value of correlation found by taking in all possible ways 9 out of the 13 photons .",
    "we find that these simulated values of correlation are @xmath56 only in 0.0009@xmath49 of cases , very close to the 0.0013@xmath49 obtained with our selection criteria .",
    "the values of correlation reported in the previous subsection , and especially the values of false alarm probability found in the previous subsection , are rather impressive . however , as discussed in the next section , the interpretation of these data presents us with some challenges . in light of this",
    "we find appropriate to stress that the picture emerging from this photon feature has intrinsic model - independent  predictive power \" .",
    "we illustrate this notion by considering the situation set up by the first two papers by ma and collaborators , refs .",
    "@xcite , which were written before may 2016 ( _ i.e. _ before the observation of grb160509a ) . at that point ma and collaborators",
    "had already discussed the photon feature using all the photons in our figure 2 , of course with the exception of the photon from grb160509a which had not yet been observed . that photon from grb160509a allowed then ma and xu , in ref .",
    "@xcite , to appropriately emphasize that the picture was finding additional support .    in a sense which we shall attempt to quantify ,",
    "the picture ma and collaborators had been developing exhibited some predictive power upon the observation of grb160509a .",
    "our quantification of this predictive power takes off by computing the value of correlation obtained with the other 8 photons on the  main line \" of figure 2 ( _ i.e. _ not including the photon from grb160509a , but including the photon on the  main line \" picked up by the selection criteria of ma and collaborators but not picked up by our selection criteria ) , finding that this correlation is of 0.9935 . with the observation of the photon from grb160509a the resulting 9-photon correlation moved up to 0.9961",
    "we shall characterize the predictive power by asking how likely it would be for a photon unrelated to those previous 8 photons on the  main line \" to produce accidentally such an increase of correlation .",
    "we randomize the time of observation of that photon from grb160509a ( within the time window specified by the time - selection criterion of ma and collaborators ) and we find that an increase of correlation from 0.9935 to 0.9961 ( or higher ) occurs only in 1.9@xmath49 of cases .",
    "we perform the same estimate also adopting our selection criteria , as a mere academic exercise ( our selection criteria are being proposed here , after the observation of grb160509a ) . with our selection criteria",
    "one has only 7 photons on the  main line \" , when considering data available before grb160509a .",
    "those 7 photons have correlation of 0.9932 . adding",
    "the photon from grb160509a one then has a 8-photon correlation of 0.9960 .",
    "we randomize the time of observation of that photon from grb160509a ( within the time window specified by our time - selection criterion ) and we find that an increase of correlation from 0.9932 to 0.9960 ( or higher ) occurs only in 0.79 @xmath49 of cases .",
    "our quantification of statistical significance gave rather impressive results both for the neutrino feature and for the photon feature .",
    "we still feel that the overall situation should be assessed prudently , since both analyses still rely on only a small group of photons and neutrinos .",
    "there is no reason to jump to any conclusions , also because both the fermi telescope and the icecube observatory will continue to report new data still for some time to come .",
    "it is nonetheless interesting to assess the present situation both from the viewpoint of possible interpretations and from the viewpoint of a possible consistency between different analyses .",
    "a first step of interpretation must concerns the 3 photons that in figure 2 do not line up with the other 8 photons , the 8 photons which lie on the  main line \"  @xcite of ma and collaborators .",
    "the tentative interpretation one must give within the setup of these analyses is that those 3 photons were not emitted in coincidence with the fist peak of the gbm signal .",
    "the time window of our selection criterion ( and similarly the one of the selection criterion adopted by ma and collaborators ) is structured in such a way to ",
    "catch \" those high - energy photons that were emitted roughly at the same time when the first peak of the gbm was emitted , but if truly in - vacuo dispersion is at work evidently it would happen occasionally that just because of in - vacuo dispersion some photons not emitted in coincidence with the first peak of the gbm end up being observed within our time window . while it is evidently difficult to quantify how frequently this should occur ,",
    "at least qualitatively what is shown in figure 2 is just what one should expect if in - vacuo dispersion truly occurs , including the presence of some photons outside the  main line \" .    as an aside , let us however notice that the significance of what is shown in figure 2 is not washed away if we include in the analysis of statistical significance also the photons outside the  main line \" .",
    "for this purpose we first notice that the value of correlation obtained by taking into account all 11 photons is 0.845 , still rather high . in our simulations ,",
    "in which we randomize the time of observation of the 11 photons ( within the time window specified by our time - selection criterion ) , we find that a value of correlation for all 11 photons @xmath57 0.845 is obtained only in 0.035 @xmath49 of cases .",
    "similar conclusions are reached adopting the criteria of ma and collaborators . in that case one",
    "has 13 photons under consideration , and the value of correlation computed for those 13 photons is 0.805 . randomizing the times of observation of those 13 photons ( within the time window specified by the time - selection criterion of ma and collaborators ) we find that a value of correlation for all 13 photons @xmath57 0.805 is obtained only in 0.037@xmath49 of cases .      in light of the observations",
    "made in the previous subsection one feels encouraged to set aside the 3 photons that fall off the  main line \" , and focus on the other 8 photons .",
    "a significant characterization of those 8 photons is obtained by assuming @xmath58 , so that the whole feature is due to a nonzero value for @xmath59 .",
    "this assumption @xmath58 is very restrictive but still the  main line \" of 8 photons in figure 1 is very well described by the model of eq.([mainnew ] ) , for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these are the parameters of the line shown in figure 2 , where the goodness of the fit of the 8 photons on the  main line \" is visible .    the story with the  main line \" , the single time offset shared by 8 photons , and @xmath58 fits indeed in remarkably nice way , in spite of being based on very restrictive assumptions .",
    "this is surely striking , but we are nonetheless inclined to proceed cautiously .",
    "there is evidently a pronounced feature , of the type here characterized , in these available grb - photon data , but its description does not necessarily have to be the one that presently fits the data so nicely . first we should stress that in spite of our impressive findings for the false alarm probabilities , we still consider as most likely the hypothesis that the feature is accidental , rather than a truly physical ( in - vacuo - dispersion - like ) feature .",
    "perhaps more surprisingly , even when taking as temporary working assumption that the feature is physical we give priority to the hypothesis that the feature might not really be describable in terms of the ingredients composed by the  main line \" ,",
    "the same time offset for 8 photons and @xmath58 .",
    "we are inclined to adopt this attitude because our intuitive assessment is that , even if the overall feature is physical , at least part of present picture , with these few data available , could be accidental .",
    "we feel that such level of prudence is methodologically correct in general , and in this case might find additional motivation in the fact that the offset time favored by the analysis summarized in figure 2 would require , as observed above , a majority of our photons to have been emitted at the source some 11 seconds before the time of emission of the gbm peak .",
    "( we might have had a slightly different intuition had we found a similar result but for 11 seconds after the gbm peak . )",
    "we give tangibility to these considerations by taking temporarily as working assumption , as an illustrative example , a hypothesis such that the feature is truly physical but the way it manifested itself so far is in part accidental .",
    "for this purpose we  scramble \" the nice picture of figure 2 by not taking under consideration the @xmath1 , time difference with respect to time of observation of gbm peak , but rather a @xmath62 , time difference with respect to trigger time of the gbm signal .",
    "we do this just to probe the dependence of our results on the perspective adopted in the analysis : we would not really expect that @xmath62 is better than @xmath1 at exposing the sought correlation , but it is interesting for us to see whether the feature completely disappears by replacing @xmath1 with @xmath62 .     with @xmath62 . ]",
    "what we get upon relying on @xmath62 in place of @xmath1 is the picture given by figure 3 . in figure 3",
    "there is no neat  main line \" , but this is after all what we would have expected before looking at the data : we would have expected the time offset at the source ( with respect to the first gbm peak or to the gbm trigger ) to be at least a bit different for different photons ; moreover , with a nonvanishing @xmath63 the time of observation of each photon would receive an additional random component .",
    "importantly for our purposes , one should notice that , while figure 3 is surely less striking than figure 2 , the feature has not disappeared : it is less pronounced but the overall picture of figure 3 still shows a surprisingly high correlation .",
    "this is what we mean by contemplating the hypothesis that only part of what is shown in figure 2 might be physical , with the rest being just accidental result of how these first 11 photons usable for our purposes happened to match very neatly a particular set of hypothesis for the interpretation and the analysis .",
    "quantitatively we have that for the data analyzed in the way reflected by figure 3 we have correlation of 0.775 , over all 11 photons picked up by our selection criteria .",
    "randomizing , within the time window specified by our time - selection criterion , the time delay of each of our 11 high - energy photons with respect to the gbm trigger of the relevant grb , we find correlation @xmath64 in only @xmath65 of cases , which is ( not as small as the @xmath66 found above for the analysis with @xmath1 , but ) still a very small false alarm probability .      in light of the observations made in the previous subsection we now set aside the 3 photons that fall off the  main line \" , and focus on the other 8 photons .",
    "a significant characterization of those 8 photons is obtained by assuming @xmath58 , so that the whole feature is due to a nonzero value for @xmath59 .",
    "this assumption @xmath58 is restrictive but still the  main line \" of 8 photons in figure 1 is very well described by the model of eq.([mainnew ] ) , for @xmath67 and @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting to compare this estimate of @xmath59 with the estimate of @xmath39 that one can obtain from the neutrino data here discussed in section iii .",
    "this comparison should be handled with some care , since some quantum - spacetime models predict ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) independent in - vacuo dispersion parameters for different particles , and also a possible dependence of the effects on polarization for photons and on helicity for neutrinos .",
    "still one would tentatively expect comparable magnitude of the effects for different particles ( including the possible dependence on polarization / helicity ) .",
    "a first important observation is the figure 1 includes  @xcite 5 neutrinos whose interpretation in terms of in - vacuo dispersion would require positive @xmath39 and 4 neutrinos whose interpretation in terms of in - vacuo dispersion would require negative @xmath39 ( this is why in figure 1 we consider  @xcite the absolute value of @xmath1 ) .",
    "another complication for our purposes originates in the fact that , as mentioned , we have reasons  @xcite to expect that 3 or 4 of those 9 grb - neutrino candidates are actually background neutrinos that happened to fit accidentally our profile of a grb - neutrino candidate .",
    "what we can do is to attempt an estimate of the absolute value @xmath68 and to perform this estimate by assuming that 3 of the 9 grb - neutrino candidates are background : essentially we estimate @xmath68 for each possible group of 6 neutrinos among our 9 grb - neutrino candidates , and we combine these estimates into a single overall estimate .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath69 .",
    "so we have an estimate of @xmath61 and an estimate of @xmath69 , which are closely comparable , as theoretical prejudice would lead us to expect . perhaps more importantly , the hypothesis that both features are accidental should also face the challenge introduced by this correspondence of values .",
    "if actually there is no in - vacuo dispersion both features should be just accidental .",
    "all 9 of our grb - neutrino candidates would just be background neutrinos who happened to fit our criteria for selection of grb - neutrino candidates and whose energies and times of observation just happened to produce the high correlation shown in figure 1 . and similarly all 11 of the photons selected by our criteria would have accidentally produced the correlation visible in figure 2 : they would be photons whose time of observation ( with respect to the time of observation of the gbm peak ) is not really correlated with energy , the correlation with energy emerging just accidentally .",
    "all these assumptions about neutrinos and photons are needed if there is no in - vacuo dispersion , with the additional observation that all these accidental facts end up producing comparable estimates of @xmath59 and @xmath68 .",
    "the level of  consistency \" ( in the sense discussed above ) between the neutrino feature and the photon feature is visually illustrated in our figure 4 , showing both our 11 photons and our 9 grb - neutrino candidates in a plot of @xmath25 versus the absolute value of @xmath1 .     and @xmath25 .",
    "]      so far we only considered two alternative hypotheses : either the two features shown in figures 1 and 2 are due to in - vacuo dispersion or there is no in - vacuo dispersion and those two features are accidental .",
    "one should of course contemplate a third possibility : there might be no in - vacuo dispersion but still at least one of those two features is not accidental , but rather the result of some other physical mechanism .",
    "this leads us naturally to wonder whether the two features could be the result of some ( so far unknown ) astrophysical properties of the sources .",
    "we believe the hypothesis that the neutrino feature be of astrophysical origin should be discarded : the relevant effects are of the order of a couple of days , and neutrinos observed two days before or after a grb could not possibly be grb neutrinos ( unless in - vacuo dispersion takes place ) . if the neutrino feature is confirmed when more abundant data become available we would know that something not of astrophysical origin has been discovered .    in this respect",
    "the photon feature is very different .",
    "the size of the effects is between a few and @xmath70 seconds , which may well be the time scale of some mechanisms intrinsic of grbs .",
    "the main reason to be skeptical about the astrophysical interpretation comes from the fact that the content of figure 2 reflects the properties of the @xmath6 : the data points ( those on the  main line \" ) line up only because we have factored the @xmath6 in the analysis , and the @xmath6 is a form of dependence on redshift which reflects propagation .",
    "so the astrophysical interpretation of the photon feature still requires assuming that at least part of the content of figure 2 is accidental : we can not exclude some mechanism at the grb producing some level of correlation between energy of the photon and difference in time of emission with respect to the gbm peak , but such a mechanism could produce the feature of figure 2 only if accidentally ( on those few data points ) it ended up taking values lending themselves to the sort of @xmath6-dependent analysis which we performed .",
    "so the astrophysical interpretation of the photon feature is possible but must face some issues .",
    "however , we should stress that also the interpretation of the photon feature in terms of the model ( [ mainnew ] ) has to face a challenge connected with grb090510 .",
    "one of 3 photons off the",
    " main line \" is a 30 gev photon from the short grb090510 . as discussed above , when taking as working assumption that in - vacuo dispersion actually takes place , these photons off the ",
    "main line \" should be interpreted as photons emitted not in ( however rough ) coincidence with the first peak of fermi s gbm .",
    "such an interpretation is certainly plausible in general , but the case of the 30 gev photon from grb090510 is a challenge . that 30gev photon was observed  @xcite within the half - second time window where most grb090510 photons with energy between 1 and 10 gev were also observed . in light of this",
    ", it is certainly very natural to assume that the 30gev photon could not have accrued an in - vacuo - dispersion effect of more than half a second , travelling from redshift of 0.9 ( the redshift of grb090510 ) , which implies @xmath71 . for @xmath72 , as suggested by the points on the  main line \" , the in - vacuo - dispersion effect for that 30gev photon should be of more than 15 seconds .",
    "it should have arrived together with that half - second - wide peak of 1 - 10gev photons because of an accidental and strong cancellation between an effect of @xmath73 seconds due to emission - time differences at the source and a 15-second in - vacuo - dispersion effect accrued propagating .",
    "this is certainly possible , but a bit  too lucky \" for our taste .",
    "we feel the the 30 gev photon from grb090510 poses a very severe challenge for the interpretation of the photon feature in terms of our model ( [ mainnew ] ) , even though all other photons in our data fit so nicely ( [ mainnew ] ) . in connection with this one",
    "should notice that the 30gev photon is the only photon in our sample coming from a short grb ( grb090510 ) .",
    "all other photons in our sample come from long grbs",
    ". if the effect is present for long grbs and absent for short grbs , then the interpretation should be astrophysical .",
    "one can also notice however that grb090510 , with its redshift of 0.9 , is one of the closest grbs relevant for our photon analysis .",
    "all other grbs in our photon analysis , with the exception of grb130427a , are at redshift greater than 1 .",
    "a scenario in which the effect is pronounced only at large redshifts could be of quantum - spacetime origin , but of course would require a quantum - spacetime picture in which the dependence on redshift of the effects is not exactly governed by the function @xmath6 .",
    "more data will soon be available both for our photons and for our neutrinos , so we shall not dwell much on the significance of our findings .",
    "we just stress that surely the false alarm probabilities here derived are small enough to motivate further interest in this type of analyses . particularly for neutrinos a much improved analysis",
    "should become soon possible , since so far icecube only made publicly available their data up to may of 2014 , so at the time of writing this article we know that some additional 2.5 years of data have been collected by icecube but have not yet been publicly released . for photons",
    "our main reference is the fermi telescope , which has been operating since 2008 . in about 8 year of operation",
    "fermi provided 7 grbs contributing to the photon side of our analysis ( see table 2 ) , so we can expect to have roughly one grb per year adding points to our figure 2 .",
    "as stressed above , if the neutrino feature was confirmed it would be very hard to even imagine an astrophysical origin for that feature . for photons instead our intuition , while being open to ultimately finding conclusive evidence of in - vacuo dispersion , presently favors the possibility of a scenario in which the feature is confirmed by additional data but in the end the correct description be given in terms of some properties of the astrophysical sources .",
    "we would welcome feedback from the astrophysics community on the type of  mechanisms at the source \" that could produce such a feature for photons . on the other hand overall , combining both the neutrino side and the photon side of our analysis , it turn out that the feature is stronger at higher energies and higher redshifts , so we feel that our findings could motivate the development by the quantum - gravity community of models similar to the one of eq.([main ] ) but such that the effects are indeed less pronounced than predicted by eq.([main ] ) at lower energies and/or lower redshifts .",
