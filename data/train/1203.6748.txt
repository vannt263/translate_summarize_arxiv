    "a taylor - couette ( tc ) apparatus consists of two coaxial , differentially rotating , cylinders , see figure [ fig : tc_geometry ] .",
    "the annulus between the cylinders is filled with a working fluid ; most commonly , as in our case , water is chosen .",
    "the apparatus has been used to study hydrodynamic instabilities , pattern formation , turbulence , and was found to have a rich phase diagram with different types of flow structures @xcite . to get a deep understanding of these phenomena it is crucial to measure the local flow velocity .     and @xmath0 , where the subscripts denote inner cylinder and outer cylinder , respectively .",
    "the inner cylinder has a radius of @xmath1 , and the outer cylinder has an inner - radius of @xmath2 .",
    "_ right : _ vertical cross section of a tc apparatus .",
    "the outer cylinder has an outer - radius of @xmath3 and a height @xmath4 .",
    "the outer cylinder is made from optically transparent pmma ( _ poly-(methyl methacrylate ) _ ) , and is attached to the top and bottom end plates . ]    measuring the velocity field inside a tc apparatus was done for a long time using intrusive measurements techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ constant temperature anemometry @xcite and pitot tubes @xcite . though these techniques are robust and proven to work , they are not ideal for measuring the velocity in tc flow .",
    "the aforementioned methods measure the magnitude of the velocity , not the individual components , and are directionally ambiguous using a single probe .",
    "of course , one could use multiple probes @xcite to obtain the flow direction .",
    "another problem is that they alter the flow under consideration .",
    "though this is not an issue for non - recirculating setups , like an open - ended wind tunnel , it can be a severe issue in recirculating ( closed ) setups , _",
    "e.g. _ a tc apparatus , a rotating drum , or a rayleigh - bnard cell @xcite . for a large range of reynolds numbers",
    "it is known that vortices will be shedded @xcite from these probes , either in form of a krmn vortex street or as a turbulent wake , depending on the geometry and reynolds number .",
    "these vortices can survive a full revolution , which has been observed in rotating drum experiments @xcite .    the tc setup used in the present work , the twente turbulent taylor - couette ( t@xmath5c ) @xcite , distincts itself from other setups by many features : variable gap and radius ratio , precise temperature control , independently rotatable cylinders , and a fully optically accessible gap .",
    "the outer cylinder is constructed from thick pmma ( _ poly-(methyl methacrylate ) _ ) , which enables optical measurement techniques , _",
    "e.g. _ particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) @xcite , particle imaging velocimetry ( piv ) @xcite , and laser doppler anemometry ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "these methods , by their very nature , will not disturb the flow under consideration .",
    "in addition these techniques are able to measure the velocity components and are directionally sensitive , such that they are capable of detecting flow reversals .",
    "the addition of seed particles is imperative for these techniques , and one should check if these particles accurately reflect the velocity of the flow , as discussed below .",
    "additionally , particles should not change the dynamics of the flow , in particular , some particles act as a surfactant in two - phase flows @xcite .",
    "lda is based on the doppler effect .",
    "the most common version of lda , is a so - called dual beam heterodyne configuration @xcite , see figures [ fig : planesandangle ] and [ fig : flatversuscurved ] . in this configuration",
    "two beams are crossed and focused in the flow , creating an interference pattern .",
    "seed particles , added to the flow , passing through the interference pattern will scatter light with a specific frequency .",
    "this light is then captured by a photo detector and converted to a current from which the doppler shift can be calculated . knowing the optical geometry of the setup one can directly calculate the velocity from the doppler shift @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the doppler shift , @xmath8 the wavelength of the laser , @xmath9 the angle between the beams , and @xmath10 the component of the velocity along @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the propagation vectors of the laser beams . to add directional sensitivity one has to frequency shift one of the beams , accomplished by a bragg cell .",
    "more details about the bragg cell , the fringe - model , and lda in general , can be found in _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "laser doppler anemometry is a so - called absolute measurement method and therefore does not require calibration against a known flow .",
    "this , however , does not mean that a measurement of velocity is error free .",
    "any misalignment in the optical arrangement , and any imperfection in the lenses ( _ e.g. _ astigmatism @xcite ) will cause errors .",
    "in addition , any particle travelling through the beams prior to focussing can have adverse effects on the formation of a well - defined measurement volume .",
    "similarly , any spatial inhomogeneity of the refractive index causes the focal point to shift , and the waists to mismatch in the measurement volume @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the number of particles in the interference zone fluctuates ; particles move in and out the measurement volume and induce noise in the collected signal .    , where @xmath13 stands for air .",
    "the solid lines are beams _ with _ refraction , @xmath14 is the angle between the beams in water .",
    "@xmath15 is the position of the laser head and @xmath16 is position of the focus without refraction , while @xmath17 is the real position of the focus . ]      in most lda applications the laser beams travel through flat surfaces , see figure [ fig : flatversuscurved ] . in this case , eq .",
    "[ eq : ldatheta ] can be simplified by invoking snell s law : @xmath18 where quantities with @xmath13 subscripts denote quantities in air , and @xmath19 in water .",
    "equation [ eq : ldasimplify ] is only applicable if the interfaces are flat and the optical axis is perpendicular to those interfaces ; it is only then that @xmath20 is the angle of incidence and @xmath21 the angle of refraction .",
    "the difference in refractive index is absorbed by the changing wavelength .",
    "so for the case of flat interfaces , @xmath22 can be obtained from the focal length and the beam separation , and together with @xmath23 , given by the laser , the velocity can be calculated from the doppler shift ( eq . [ eq : ldasimplify ] ) .",
    "note that the refractive indices of the container and water are irrelevant ; they are not used in the calculation of the velocity",
    ".     does not vary with laser - head position .",
    "_ right : _ horizontal plane : laser beams are affected by the curved interfaces , and therefore @xmath9 is a function of radial position . ]    for the case of a curved surface , see fig .",
    "[ fig : flatversuscurved ] , eq .",
    "[ eq : ldasimplify ] does not hold . for this case",
    "snell s law can not ( easily ) be applied in order to transform @xmath14 to @xmath22 .",
    "a prerequisite of calculating the correct velocity is therefore the knowledge of @xmath14 as a function of gap - position .",
    "most commonly the calculation of the velocity is implemented in the supplied software and implicitly assumes eq .",
    "[ eq : ldasimplify ] to hold . for the case of curved interfaces",
    "this equation does not hold , and therefore the measured velocity has to be corrected by multiplying it with a correction factor @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath13 subscripts denote quantities in air , and @xmath19 in water , see also fig . [",
    "fig : planesandangle ] .",
    "the problem at hand is predominantly solved by mounting prisms ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) to the outer cylinder of the tc apparatus , or by putting the entire apparatus inside a liquid bath ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) with flat windows .",
    "the latter having two purposes : the liquid bath can act as a coolant and match the refractive index of the working fluid . in this way the beams travel through the outer cylinder with less deflection ; this solution is , however , not perfect because of the finite thickness of the outer cylinder .",
    "matching the refractive indices of the working fluid , the liquid bath , and the outer cylinder does solve the issue , but becomes cumbersome for large scale devices , or impossible if the studied fluid is a gas .",
    "the use of prisms is tantamount to the use of a liquid bath , and is also unable to fully correct for the problem .",
    "furthermore , applying prisms is technically demanding once the outside is in motion .",
    "theoretically one can derive the trajectories of the laser light .",
    "@xcite derives these trajectories and even finds simplifications for the found solutions .",
    "this analysis is , however , not complete , as it only considers 1 plane of refraction ; the inside of the outer cylinder . in our application",
    "our cylinder is very thick compared to our measurement range ; the gap of our apparatus is versus a cylinder of thickness . here",
    "we will consider both interfaces , and calculate the trajectories by using a ray - tracer , and we will show that taking into account both interfaces is _ crucial _ for our experiments . utilizing a ray - tracer",
    "has several advantages compared to a theoretical derivation for the present experimental setup ( _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) : a theoretical derivation becomes cumbersome if one tries to find a formula after more than one refraction .",
    "the t@xmath5c  system will be equipped with multiple outer cylinders to alter the gap - width , a ray - tracer is then more generalized and is able to handle multiple interfaces .",
    "the next section describes the use of a ray - tracer in order to account for the effects of the curved interfaces .",
    "a 3d ray - tracer is built in order to calculate two parameters : the angle @xmath14 for the green beam pair in the horizontal plane , and the position of the crossings of the blue and green beam pairs in the vertical and horizontal plane , respectively . for the blue beam pair ( in the axial - radial plane )",
    ", the curvature effects does not affect the flow velocity measurements , and therefore eq . [ eq : ldasimplify ] is applicable ; the axial velocity does not require correction .",
    "the azimuthal velocity , however , does need correction .",
    "the ray - tracer is based on simple principles : starting at point @xmath26 with direction @xmath12 , it checks which interfaces are hit for some @xmath27 at position @xmath28 .",
    "the next point in the ray - trace can be defined from the interface that is hit first : @xmath29 .",
    "the normal of this interface is calculated at position @xmath30 , and is denoted @xmath31 , where the hat means the vector has unit length . for the case of reflection the new direction is given by : @xmath32 for the case of refraction , snell s law : @xmath33 is solved for @xmath34 under the constraint that it has unit length and in the plane spanned by @xmath31 and @xmath35 .",
    "this can be implemented without the use of trigonometric functions , which can be troublesome in certain fringe cases , see the appendix for more details .",
    "once the new position and new direction are found , the algorithm can be repeated until it exits the apparatus , or until it is absorbed by a surface .",
    "this algorithm has been applied to the geometry of our lda and tc setup .",
