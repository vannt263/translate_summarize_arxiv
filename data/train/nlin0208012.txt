    "the anisotropic manev problem describes the motion of two point masses in an anisotropic configuration plane under the influence of a newtonian force - law with a relativistic correction term . the isotropic case is the classical manev problem ; its origins lie in the work of newton , who introduced it in _ principia _ aiming to understand the apsidal motion of the moon ( see @xcite ) .",
    "manev found in the 1930s that a proper choice of the constants that show up in the correction term allow the theoretical explanation of the perihelion advance of mercury and of the other inner planets .",
    "the first author suggested the study of the anisotropic manev problem in 1995 , hoping to find connections between classical , quantum , and relativistic mechanics .",
    "it was indeed proved in @xcite that the rich collision - orbit manifold of the system exhibits classical , quantum , and relativistic properties .",
    "this encouraged further studies , as for example @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite , using a suitable generalization of the poincar - melnikov method ( see @xcite for the classical approach or @xcite for a parallel , at least in part , complementary approach ) , we proved that chaos occurs on the zero - energy manifold , thus showing the complexity of the dynamics . using perturbations techniques and the poincar continuation method , the second author investigated in @xcite the classes of periodic solutions that arise from symmetries in the case of small values of the anisotropy parameter .",
    "in this paper we gain a better understanding of the complicated global dynamics encountered in this problem .",
    "we first prove that negative - energy solutions are bounded and find the heteroclinic orbits that connect the equilibria of the collision manifold , which we obtain through mcgehee - type transformations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "physically they correspond to ejection - collision orbits .",
    "then we employ perturbation techniques to detect possible global chaotic behaviour .",
    "as remarked in @xcite , the perturbation analysis of @xcite can not be used to study ejection - collision solutions .",
    "however , we surpass this difficulty with the help of mcgehee - type coordinates , which allow us to view the anisotropic manev problem as a perturbation of the classical manev case .    using an approach inspired by @xcite , which works in some degenerate cases  as for example those of unstable nonhyperbolic points or critical points located at infinity ( see @xcite ) , we develop a suitable extension of the poincar - melnikov method , which we use to prove the existence of transversal homoclinic orbits to a periodic one .",
    "it is interesting to note that our result extends the one obtained in @xcite to a non - hamiltonian system that has negatively and positively asymptotic sets to a nonhyperbolic periodic orbit . in the present context",
    "the asymptotic sets are the stable and the unstable manifolds",
    ".    then we return to the original coordinates and apply a variational principle for detecting periodic orbits . using the rotation index ,",
    "we divide the set of periodic paths into homotopy classes , which are sobolev spaces .",
    "then we use the lower semicontinuity version of hilbert s direct method ( due to tonelli , see @xcite ) to find a minimizer of the action in each class .",
    "according to the least action principle , the minimizer is a solution of the anisotropic manev problem .",
    "we prove that the minimizer exists , belongs to the homotopy class , and is a solution in the classical sense .",
    "this generalizes a result obtained by the second author , @xcite , where it was shown that such orbits exist for small values of @xmath0 . in the end we put into the evidence some new properties of symmetric periodic orbits .",
    "the idea of using variational principles to obtain periodic orbits for @xmath1-body - type particle systems first appeared in @xcite and has been recently used in connection with symmetry conditions to obtain new periodic orbits in the classical @xmath1-body problem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but unlike the newtonian case , the manev force is `` strong '' ( as defined in @xcite ) , so the variational method is easier to apply in our situation than in the newtonian one .",
    "this is because in the manev case we do not have to deal with the difficulty of avoiding collision orbits , which have infinite action and therefore can not be minimizers .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  2 we write the equations of motion and transform them to an equivalent system using a `` blow - up '' technique devised by mcgehee , which allow us to introduce the concept of a collision manifold . in section  3 we present two global results : the boundedness of the solutions for negative energy and the existence of certain symmetric ejection - collision orbits . in section  4",
    "we describe the anisotropic manev problem as a perturbation of the manev case . in section  5",
    "we develop a suitable generalization of the poincar - melnikov method and in section  6 we apply it to find infinitely many transverse homoclinic orbits that show that the dynamics of the problem is extremely complex , possibly chaotic .",
    "finally , in section  7 we use a variational principle to prove the existence of infinitely many classes of symmetric periodic orbits .",
    "the ( planar ) anisotropic manev problem is described by the hamiltonian h=1 2*p*^2 - 1 -b x^2 + y^2 , [ h ] where @xmath0 is a constant , @xmath2 is the position of one body with respect to the other considered fixed at the origin of the coordinate system , and @xmath3 is the momentum of the moving particle .",
    "the constant @xmath4 measures the strength of the anisotropy and we can very well take @xmath5 ; but to remain consistent with the choice made in previous papers , we will consider @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath6 we recover the classical manev problem .",
    "the equations of motion are \\",
    "{    l = * p * + = -h .    .",
    "[ eqmotion ] the hamiltonian provides the first integral h(*p*(t),*q*(t))=h , [ energy ] where @xmath7 is a real constant . unlike in the classical manev case",
    ", the angular momentum @xmath8 does not yield a first integral .",
    "this is because the anisotropy of the plane destroys the rotational invariance .    since our first goal is to study collision and near collision solutions , it is helpful to transform system ( [ eqmotion ] ) using a method developed by mcgehee @xcite .",
    "the idea is to `` blow - up '' the collision singularity , replace it with a so - called collision manifold and extend the phase space to it .",
    "the collision manifold is fictitious in the sense that it has no physical meaning .",
    "however , studying the flow on it provides useful information about near - collision orbits .",
    "consider the coordinate transformations \\ {    l r=|*q*| + = ( y / x ) + v = r r=(xp_x+yp_y ) + u = r^2=(xp_y - yp_x ) ,    . and the rescaling of time d = r^-2dt .",
    "composing these transformations , which are analytic diffeomorphisms in their respective domains , system ( [ eqmotion ] ) becomes \\ {    l r=rv + v=2r^2h+r^-1/2 + =u + u=(1/2)(-1)(r^-3/2 + 2b^-2)2 [ mcgehee ]    .",
    "and the energy relation ( [ energy ] ) takes the form u^2+v^2 - 2r^-1/2 - 2b^-1=2r^2h , [ energyrelation ] where @xmath9 and the new variables @xmath10 depend on the fictitious time @xmath11 .",
    "the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath11 .    the set c= \\ { ( r , v,,u)|r=0 } is the _ collision manifold _ , which replaces the set of singularities @xmath12 .",
    "this 2-dimensional manifold , embedded in @xmath13 , is homeomorphic to a torus and it is given by the equations r=0 u^2+v^2=2b^-1 .",
    "the flow on the collision manifold was studied in detail in @xcite . here",
    "we will briefly recall its main features .",
    "let s consider the restriction of system ( [ mcgehee ] ) to @xmath14 .",
    "the solutions of the restriction lie on the level curves @xmath15 of the torus @xmath14 .",
    "there are eight equilibrium points . in the variables",
    "@xmath16 the first four equilibria are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are real and take the values @xmath19 .",
    "the other four equilibria are @xmath20 and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath21 , where the last two eigenvalues are purely imaginary since @xmath0 .",
    "moreover there are eight heteroclinic orbits which lie in the level sets @xmath22 .",
    "all the other solutions are periodic ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the flow near the collision manifold was studied in @xcite , in which most of the results are essentially local . in this section",
    "we will prove two global results that extend the understanding of the problem under discussion .",
    "the first one concerns the boundedness of solutions on negative energy levels .    for any negative value of the energy constant , @xmath23",
    ", there exists a positive real number @xmath24 such that any given solution @xmath25 of system ( [ mcgehee ] ) satisfies the relation @xmath26 .    _",
    "proof : _ let us assume that there is no @xmath24 with the above property .",
    "then at least one unbounded solution exists . since by the energy relation ( [ energyrelation ] ) , @xmath27 , and since @xmath23",
    ", there is some @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is negative  a contradiction .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "the next result deals with the existence of heteroclinic orbits connecting the equilibria but lying outside the collision manifold . but before stating and proving it , let us recall some facts that summarize the behavior of the flow near the collision manifold",
    ". denote by @xmath30 the periodic orbit on @xmath14 having @xmath31 .",
    "the following property was proved in @xcite .    on the collision manifold @xmath14 the equilibria @xmath32 and @xmath33 are saddles whereas the equilibria @xmath34 are centers .",
    "outside the collision manifold the equilibria @xmath32 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 have a @xmath37-dimensional unstable analytic manifold , whereas the equilibria @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 have a @xmath37-dimensional stable analytic manifold .",
    "each periodic orbit @xmath30 on @xmath14 with @xmath41(@xmath42 ) has a @xmath43-dimensional local unstable analytic manifold , while the periodic orbit @xmath44 has both a @xmath43-dimensional local unstable and a @xmath43-dimensional local stable manifold ( see fig .",
    "2 )    the above properties are local , the following one , however , is global .",
    "we will now show that the equilibria with positive @xmath45 coordinate have a 1-dimensional global unstable manifold while the equilibria with a negative @xmath45 have a 1-dimensional stable manifold .",
    "moreover , the equilibria are connected by heteroclinic orbits starting from an equilibrium with positive @xmath45 and ending in the symmetric one with respect to the @xmath46 plane",
    ".    there are four heteroclinic orbits outside the collision manifold @xmath14 : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 connecting respectively @xmath51 with @xmath52 , @xmath53 with @xmath38 , @xmath54 with @xmath55 , and @xmath36 with @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "2 )    _ proof : _ first we show that @xmath56 and @xmath57 describe four invariant sets .",
    "consider @xmath58 and @xmath59 , as initial conditions .",
    "then @xmath60 , @xmath61 satisfies system ( [ mcgehee ] ) , hence ( by the uniqueness property for solutions ) @xmath56 , @xmath62 define an invariant set .",
    "the same reasoning can be applied if @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "now let s study the energy relation ( [ energyrelation ] ) when @xmath56 and @xmath65 . after simple computations we get v^2+(r-1 )",
    "^2=2b + 12|h| .",
    "the above equation describes an ellipse whose intersections with @xmath66 give @xmath67 , which are exactly the equilibrium points @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "moreover the maximum value of @xmath68 is v_max= and the maximum value of @xmath69 , attained when @xmath44 , is r_max= 1(2|h|)+ 2|h| .",
    "consequently for @xmath56 , @xmath62 ( @xmath70 ) there exist heteroclinic orbits @xmath71 , ( @xmath72 ) ejecting from @xmath53 ( @xmath38 ) and tending to @xmath38 ( @xmath40 ) ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "similarly when @xmath56 and @xmath63 the energy relation can be reduced to the form v^2+(r-1 ) ^2=2b+1 2|h| , which describes an ellipse .",
    "the intersections with @xmath66 are @xmath73 and represent the equilibria @xmath34 . in this case",
    "v_max= and r_max=1 2|h| + 2|h| .",
    "thus we found heteroclinic orbits @xmath74 ejecting from @xmath35 and tending to @xmath75 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we will now write the anisotropic manev problem as a perturbation of the classical manev case . consider weak anisotropies , i.e. , choose the parameter @xmath4 close to @xmath37 . introducing the notation @xmath76 with @xmath77",

    "the collision manifold is the set of solutions given by r=0 , u^2+v^2=2b .",
    "notice that , from the geometric point of view , the collision manifold is a cylinder in the three - dimensional space of coordinates @xmath80 and , since @xmath81 $ ] , it follows that this cylinder can be identified with a torus .",
    "the flow on the collision manifold is formed almost exclusively by non - hyperbolic periodic orbits , except for the upper and lower circles of the torus given by @xmath82 , which consist of equilibrium points .",
    "there is only a single orbit ejecting from each fixed point of the upper circle @xmath83 and a single orbit tending to the lower circle @xmath84 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover it can be easily proved ( see @xcite ) that for every periodic orbit @xmath85 on the collision manifold with @xmath86 there exist a manifold of orbits , lying on a cylinder , which eject from @xmath85 .",

    "let @xmath161 .",
    "with this assumption we can rewrite the first melnikov condition as m_1=^2_0i_1^a+^2_0i_1^b-2_0 i_1^c , where \\ {    l i_1^a = e^-12__0^ v(s ) ds rr^2   d + i_1^b = e^-12__0^ v(s ) ds rr^2   d + i_1^c = e^-12__0^ v(s ) ds rr   d.    .",

    "particular care is needed when integrating @xmath162 and @xmath163 since they converge only conditionally . to obtain computational convergence , we choose the limits in @xmath162 such that    i_2^a&=_n_-n/2^n/2(b+1 2|h|+(-_0)^2)2  d + & = ( 2_0)e^-2 .",

    "we therefore have only one independent condition ; this is clearly a consequence of the energy relation .",
    "we can find simple zeroes when @xmath164 , i.e. , for @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
    "hence , by corollary 1 , we have proved the existence of an infinite sequence of intersections on the poincar section of the negatively and positively asymptotic sets of the periodic orbit and the existence of homoclinic orbits leaving the equator of the collision manifold and going back to it .",
    "this situation is clearly reminiscent of the chaotic dynamics described by the poincar - birkhoff - smale theorem in terms of symbolic dynamics and the smale horseshoe .",
    "unfortunately this theorem can not be directly applied , nor can the theorems proved in @xcite , since the poincar - birkhoff - smale theorem considers hyperbolic fixed points while the arguments in @xcite apply to area - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "however the arguments contained in those theorems strongly suggest the occurrence of a chaotic dynamics .",
    "moreover it is easy to verify , and interesting to remark , that the orbits we found above are not @xmath167-symmetric , where the @xmath168 symmetry is defined by @xmath169 ( see @xcite ) and an orbit @xmath170 is said to be @xmath171-symmetric if @xmath172 .",

    "thus for @xmath78 small enough the perturbed orbit can never have @xmath56 .",
    "we can now summarize the above discussion as follows :    let us consider the anisotropic manev problem given by the equation of motion ( [ mcgehee ] ) with the energy relation ( [ energyrelation ] ) .",
    "then there is an infinite sequence of intersections in the poincar section of the negatively and positively asymptotic sets of the periodic orbits at the equator of the collision manifold ( possibly giving rise to a chaotic dynamics ) .",
    "furthermore there exist the homoclinic non @xmath168-symmetric orbits to the periodic orbit described above .",
    "we now return to the original cartesian coordinates , which are more convenient for the purpose of finding certain periodic solutions .",
    "let us first notice that the equations ( [ eqmotion ] ) admit the following symmetries : @xmath176 which are the elements of an abelian group of order eight , isomorphic to @xmath177 , that is generated by @xmath178 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we first need to introduce some notations .        and let @xmath186 , @xmath187 be the corresponding norms . then the completion of @xmath182,\\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] with respect to the norm @xmath186 is denoted by @xmath188 and it is the space of square integrable functions .",

    "we will restrict our attention to the spaces @xmath193 with @xmath194 .",
    "let us now prove the following result .",
    "let @xmath189 be defined as above , then the subspaces @xmath193 of @xmath191-symmetric paths with @xmath194 are closed , weakly closed , and complete with respect to the norm @xmath187 , and are therefore sobolev spaces . moreover h^1=_1_2=_0_6 .    _ proof : _ we first show an interesting fact : we can write @xmath195 as the sum of an @xmath180 and an @xmath181-symmetric path . indeed it is well known that we can write @xmath196 and @xmath197 as the sum of an even and an odd absolutely continuous function , i.e. as @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "using this idea we can write the path @xmath200 as the sum of an @xmath180-symmetric function , @xmath201 , and an @xmath181-symmetric one , @xmath202 .",

    "then @xmath204 for every @xmath205 .",
    "this is because @xmath206 where the first integrand is an odd function and the second is an odd function almost everywhere .",
    "thus the above scalar product is zero for every @xmath207 .",
    "let us denote the space orthogonal to @xmath208 by @xmath209 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath210 is closed and that @xmath211 .",

    "then write @xmath216 and consider @xmath217 , which means that @xmath218 .",
    "but this contradicts the hypothesis that @xmath219 .",
    "therefore @xmath220 . so @xmath221 and consequently @xmath208",
    "are closed and such that @xmath222 . moreover , since @xmath189 is a metric space , @xmath208 and @xmath221 are complete .",
    "also @xmath208 and @xmath221 are weakly closed since they are norm - closed subspaces .",
    "the statements for @xmath223 and @xmath224 can be proved in a similar way .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let us now introduce some new definitions .",
    "we will say that a path in @xmath193 is of class @xmath225 , @xmath226 , if its winding number about the origin of the coordinate system is @xmath1 ( i.e. if it makes @xmath1 loops around the origin ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath1 is positive for a counterclockwise rotation and negative otherwise .",
    "consider the sets @xmath227,\\mathbb{r}^2\\backslash\\{0\\})$ ] .",
    "notice that they are open submanifolds of the spaces @xmath190,\\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] and that the family @xmath228 provides a partition of those spaces into homotopy classes , also called components .",
    "two periodic orbits of the isotropic manev problem ( @xmath6 ) , one of class @xmath229 and the other of class @xmath230 , are depicted in fig .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath231 of the anisotropic manev problem given by system ( [ eqmotion ] ) has the expression l(x , y , x , y)=1 2(x^2+y^2 ) + 1 + b x^2 + y^2 , [ l ] and the action integral along a path @xmath232 from time @xmath233 to time @xmath183 , whose euclidean coordinate representation is @xmath234 , takes the form @xmath235    according to hamilton s principle , the extremals of the functional @xmath236 are solutions of the equations ( [ eqmotion ] ) .",
    "hence we want to obtain periodic solutions of ( [ eqmotion ] ) by finding extremals of the functional @xmath237 .",
    "for this we will use a direct method of the calculus of variation , namely the lower - semicontinuity method ( see @xcite ) . in preparation of a satisfactory theory of existence , the notion of admissible function has to be relaxed since the extremals we obtain belong to a sobolev space .",
    "therefore the above method provides only `` weak '' solutions of our problem . to show that the paths are regular enough to be classical solutions , we need the following result , proved in @xcite .",
    "in particular it is well known that if @xmath232 is a minimizer of the action @xmath236 in the space @xmath239,\\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] and if @xmath232 has no collisions , then @xmath232 is a @xmath183-periodic solution to ( [ eqmotion ] ) .",
    "collision have to be excluded because equations ( [ eqmotion ] ) break down at collisions and because the action is not differentiable at paths with collisions . in this paper",
    "we are interested to restrict ourself to the spaces @xmath193 of @xmath191-symmetric paths for @xmath240 .",
    "the paths that are @xmath241-symmetric have to be excluded in the study of periodic orbits since @xmath241-symmetric paths must intersect the origin and therefore encounter collisions .",
    "now it is not obvious that a collisionless minimizer in @xmath193 is a periodic solution of system ( [ eqmotion ] ) .",
    "however , according to the principle of `` symmetric criticality '' ( see for example @xcite ) this is actually true .",
    "indeed , it can be proved that if @xmath232 is a collision free path with @xmath242 for every @xmath243 , then @xmath244 for all @xmath245,\\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] and thus @xmath232 is a critical point in the bigger loop space @xmath189 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the only obstacle left for applying the direct method is the `` noncompactness '' of the configuration space .",
    "indeed we want to exclude the possibility that the minimizer is obtained when the bodies are at infinite distance from each other or are collision paths .",
    "the first problem is solved restricting ourselves to non - simple cycles , i.e. , to cycles that are not homotopic to a point and thus are not in the homotopy class @xmath246 .",
    "the second problem is solved by the following result .",
    "to apply the direct method we still need to recall some properties of lower semicontinuous ( l.s.c ) functions .",
    "let @xmath250 be a real valued function on a topological space @xmath251 .",
    "then @xmath252 is l.s.c . if and only if @xmath253 $ ] is closed for every @xmath254 , in which case @xmath252 is bounded below and attains its infimum on every compact subset of @xmath251 .",
    "moreover when @xmath251 is hausdorff then compact sets are necessarily closed and thus we have the following result .",

    "for any @xmath257 and any @xmath258 , there is at least one @xmath191-symmetric ( @xmath240 ) periodic orbit of the anisotropic manev problem that has period  @xmath183 and winding number @xmath1 ( i.e. , belongs to the homotopy class @xmath225 ) .    _",
    "proof : _ let @xmath251 be a component of @xmath227,\\mathbb{r}^2\\backslash \\{0\\})$ ] for @xmath240 , that consist of non - simple cycles . endow @xmath251 with the weak topology it inherits from @xmath190,\\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] .",
    "then @xmath251 is a subset of an hilbert space and it is weakly compact if and only if it is weakly closed .          since @xmath264 the elements of @xmath251",
    "are bounded in arc length , and from lemma  5 it follows that the elements of @xmath251 are bounded away from the origin .",
    "moreover the elements of @xmath251 are non - simple and thus bounded in the @xmath265 norm and hence in the @xmath188 norm .",
    "this last fact combined with @xmath264 shows that @xmath251 is bounded in the @xmath187 norm .",
    "thus also @xmath266 $ ] is bounded in the @xmath189 norm .",
    "now suppose that @xmath267 is a sequence in @xmath268 $ ] that converges weakly to a cycle @xmath269,\\mathbb{r}^2)$ ] for @xmath240 . from general principles ,",
    "@xmath270 is bounded and @xmath271 because weak @xmath193-convergence implies @xmath265-convergence .",
    "since @xmath272 it means that @xmath273 is bounded and since @xmath274 on @xmath275 $ ] it follows that @xmath276 is bounded",
    ". moreover , lemma  5 guarantees that the functions @xmath277 are bounded away from the origin so that @xmath232 is homotopic to the @xmath277 in @xmath278 .",
    "therefore @xmath279 .    to complete the proof we have to show that @xmath280 $ ] .",
    "we know that @xmath281 since weak convergence in @xmath193 implies @xmath265-convergence .",
    "for each @xmath1 let @xmath282 and denote @xmath283 each @xmath284 is of class @xmath285 since @xmath286 .",
    "this implies that the set of all @xmath287 for which @xmath288 has zero measure , otherwise the integral of @xmath289 would be unbounded .",
    "so @xmath290 almost everywhere .",
    "also @xmath291 . by fatou",
    "s lemma it follows that @xmath292 is @xmath285 and that @xmath293",
    "now we can use the fact that the norm is weakly sequentially lower semicontinuous ( see @xcite ) , thus @xmath294 where the last equality holds since @xmath295 converges strongly to @xmath232 in @xmath188 .",
    "consequently        recall now that two intersections of every @xmath180-symmetric ( @xmath181-symmetric ) orbit with the @xmath297 axis ( @xmath298 axis ) must be orthogonal . to distinguish them from accidental orthogonal intersections , which do not follow because of the symmetry",
    ", we will call them _ essential orthogonal intersections_. from the proof of theorem  5 and obvious index theory considerations , the following result follows ( see also fig .  4 ) .",
    "if the essential orthogonal intersections with the @xmath297-axis ( @xmath298-axis ) of an @xmath180-symmetric ( @xmath181-symmetric ) periodic orbit lie on the same side of the axis with respect to the origin of the coordinate system , then the orbit has an even winding number . if the essential orthogonal intersections are on opposite sides with respect to the origin , then the periodic orbit has an odd winding number .",
    "since the symmetries @xmath299 and @xmath181 generate the entire symmetry group , it is clear that theorem  5 captures all periodic orbits with symmetries .",
    "this result , however , does not tell if other symmetric periodic orbits exist beyond the the ones with @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 symmetries .",
    "let us therefore end our paper by proving that @xmath300-periodic orbits do indeed exist .",
    "in fact they form a rich set if compared to the one of @xmath300-symmetric orbits of the anisotropic kepler problem ( given by ( [ h ] ) with @xmath301 ) , which contains only circular orbits .",
    "we will show that in our case each homotopy class @xmath225 , @xmath302 , @xmath303 integer , contains at least one @xmath300-symmetric periodic orbit .",
    "other homotopy classes may have @xmath300-symmetric periodic orbits , but our approach proves their existence only for winding numbers of the form @xmath302 , @xmath303 integer .",
    "we consider the set of all paths with one end on the @xmath297 axis and the other on the @xmath298 axis of the coordinate system . as in the case of periodic cycles discussed in the first part of this section , for a given @xmath304 this set",
    "can be endowed with a hilbert space structure , the completion of which is a sobolev space . we further divide this space in homotopy classes @xmath305 according to the winding number @xmath1 .    using the boundary conditions , it is easy to see that in each class @xmath306 the minimizer of the action is a an arc orthogonal to the @xmath297 and @xmath298 axes .",
    "its existence and the fact that it is a solution in the classical sense can be proved in a similar way as we did for periodic cycles .",
    "once obtaining such a solution with ends on the @xmath297 and @xmath298 axes , we can use the @xmath300-symmetry and the orthogonality with the axes to complete this solution arc to a periodic orbit of period @xmath257 .",
    "the symmetry implies that the winding number is of the form @xmath302 , @xmath303 integer .",
    "this is because if , for example , a solution arc with the ends on the @xmath297 and @xmath298 axes has a loop around the origin , then the corresponding periodic orbit has four loops around the origin .",
    "we have thus obtained the following result .    for any @xmath257 and any @xmath302 , @xmath303 integer",
    ", there is at least one @xmath300-symmetric periodic orbit of the anisotropic manev problem that has period @xmath183 and winding number @xmath1 ( i.e. , belongs to the homotopy class @xmath225 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note in conclusion that if viewing the anisotropy parameter as a perturbation and the anisotropic manev problem as a perturbation of the isotropic case ( see section  4 ) , the @xmath191-symmetric ( @xmath240 ) periodic orbits of the isotropic problem are deformed but not destroyed by introducing the anisotropy , no matter how large its size .",
