    "during the last five years , we have witnessed the discovery of hundreds of ultracool dwarfs , located in the solar neighborhood and in young open clusters and associations , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "detailed study of their properties is still in its infancy , but some general facts seem to be already well established .",
    "non - gray model atmospheres have shown that dust forms under the low - temperature and high - density conditions prevalent in m dwarfs with @xmath4  k , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "dust grains such as calcium titanate ( catio@xmath5 ) and corundum ( al@xmath6o@xmath5 ) have been held responsible for the observed depletion of gaseous tio from the atmospheres of the coolest m dwarfs .",
    "a new spectral class , designated as l , has been defined to classify dwarfs cooler than m @xcite .",
    "the optical spectra of late l dwarfs do not show any tio features , and they are dominated by broad resonance lines of alkali elements ( cs , k , na , rb ) .",
    "the @xmath7 colors of late m and l dwarfs are extremely red due to their cool temperatures and the greenhouse effect caused by dust opacity , which dissociates the main molecular absorbers in the @xmath8-band ( co and h@xmath6o ) .",
    "dusty atmospheric models are more successful than dust - free models in reproducing the observed colors of late m and l dwarfs in the field @xcite , in the pleiades cluster @xcite , and in very low - mass multiple systems @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the same models can not explain the blue @xmath7 colors of even cooler dwarfs ( @xmath9  k ) , such as gl  229  b , without gravitational settling of dust grains @xcite .",
    "the real atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs are likely to be very dynamical , due to turbulent motions related to convection and rotation @xcite .",
    "ultracool dwarfs are generally fast rotators .",
    "rotational broadening ( @xmath10sin@xmath11 ) for about 40 late - m and l dwarfs has been measured using high - resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "the majority of the ultracool dwarfs have @xmath12 km  s@xmath13 , with a trend for faster rotation toward cooler temperatures .",
    "the late l dwarfs also tend to be very inactive as judged from the flux of h@xmath3 emission @xcite .",
    "chandra observations of the m9 dwarf lp944 - 20 have set an upper limit to the quiescent x - ray emission that is two orders of magnitude lower than typical x - ray emission levels in m0m6 dwarfs @xcite .",
    "bri  0021@xmath00214 is an ultracool dwarf ( m9.5 ) that was discovered during the course of a survey for high - redshift quasars because it has an extremely red @xmath14 color @xcite . among the known very late m and l dwarfs ,",
    "bri  0021@xmath00214 is one of the fastest rotators with @xmath15  km  s@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is a very inactive dwarf because it usually does not show a detectable h@xmath3 emission line @xcite , although a weak flare has been observed once @xcite . even at the maximum of the flare , the level of activity was 3 times lower than the mean quiescent level in mid - type m dwarfs .",
    "the flare recurrence rate was estimated to be @xmath167% of the time .",
    "@xcite reported a nondetection of x - rays from bri  0021@xmath00214 in a pointed rosat / hri observation of 106 kiloseconds , implying @xmath17 , which is one of their most sensitive upper limits to x - ray emission from brown dwarf candidates .",
    "the fast rotation of bri  0021@xmath00214 , originally reported by @xcite , prompted us to start a program of ccd monitoring in 1995 .",
    "earlier results of a program of ccd observations of m7m9 field dwarfs have been reported in @xcite .",
    "thermal inhomogeneities in the atmosphere , such as magnetic cool spots or massive cloud systems , could be modulated with the rotation period , which is expected to be shorter than 0.135  day for a typical radius of 0.1  @xmath18 .",
    "thus during one observing night , the object completes a few rotation cycles .",
    "this paper reports on the results of monitoring the behavior of bri  0021@xmath00214 in the @xmath1-band over 10 nights in 1995 and 4 nights in 1996 . in ",
    "2 we describe the data acquisition , reduction , and analysis techniques . in ",
    "3 we present the light curves that result from the differential photometry .",
    "we discuss the results and implications in  4 , and our conclusions and directions for future research in  5 .",
    "ccd images of bri  0021@xmath00214 were obtained on the nights of 1995 november 815 and 2223 with the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope ( jkt ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( la palma ) , and on the nights of 1996 august 1922 with the 0.82 m telescope ( iac80 ) at the observatorio del teide ( tenerife ) .",
    "we used standard broadband @xmath1 filters .",
    "the jkt was equipped with a @xmath19 pixel tektronix camera mounted on the cassegrain focus , providing a field of view of 32.3 arcmin@xmath20 ( 0333 pix@xmath13 ) .",
    "the iac80 was equipped with a @xmath19 pixel thomson camera mounted on the cassegrain focus , providing a field of view of 54.4 arcmin@xmath20 ( 0433 pix@xmath13 ) .",
    "all nights were photometric with the exception of 1995 november 15 and 1996 august 2122 , which had some patchy thin cirrus .",
    "exposure times ranged from 300  s to 500  s. we adjusted the exposure time to compensate for extinction due to high airmass or cirrus clouds .",
    "the seeing of the images varied from 10 to 25 , and the airmasses at which they were taken ranged from 1.18 up to 1.80 .",
    "all the ccd frames were bias subtracted and flat fielded using packages within the iraf environment .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on bri  0021@xmath00214 and on five other stars in the field using `` vaphot , '' an iraf script written by hans deeg @xcite .",
    "we verified that the two brightest stars in the field of view are not variable on the timescale of our observations , and we have used them as reference stars .",
    "they are shown in figure  1 .",
    "images were first aligned , and the nonoverlapping parts were removed .",
    "changes in the seeing conditions and in the telescope focus throughout a night implied variations in the size of the point - spread function ( psf ) of the stellar sources from frame to frame . to take this into account",
    "we derived an average psf of the three stars by fitting a circular gaussian on each frame .",
    "all three sources comply with the requisites for a good definition of the psf . additionally , to obtain high signal - to - noise aperture photometry , we determined optimum apertures for each star according to @xcite .",
    "all apertures were expressed in multiples of the fwhm of the average psf , and the sky intensity was defined as an outer ring 1.5 pixels wide .",
    "these multiples were kept constant from night to night .",
    "finally , instrumental magnitudes were computed , and relative magnitudes ( i.e. , differential photometry ) of bri  0021@xmath00214 with respect to the sum of the flux of the two reference stars were derived .",
    "the 1@xmath21 accuracy of the differential photometry is @xmath220.006mag and @xmath220.003mag for the iac80 and jkt data , respectively .",
    "figure  2 displays the light curve of bri  0021@xmath00214 obtained at the jkt in 1995 november .",
    "the photometry of reference star 1 with respect to reference star 2 is also shown .",
    "the target presents a larger photometric dispersion than the two reference stars . in figure  3 , we show the standard deviation ( @xmath21 ) associated with the total jkt differential light curve of bri  0021@xmath00214 and five other stars ( including the references 1 and 2 ) in the field of view of our ccd images .",
    "we call this quantity @xmath23 in analogy to bailer - jones & mundt ( 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-band photometry was calibrated using the denis @xmath1-band magnitude of reference star 1 ( x. delfosse , 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "the value of @xmath23 increases toward fainter magnitude , as expected .",
    "we find a rather tight relationship between @xmath1-band magnitude and @xmath23 value for the jkt data ( @xmath24 ) with a scatter of 0.0006 mag ( 1  @xmath21 ) .",
    "the amplitude of photometric variability in the jkt data of bri  0021@xmath00214 is 0.0182 magnitudes .",
    "this value is 14  @xmath21 away from the relation between i - magnitude versus @xmath23 for the reference stars .",
    "figure  4 displays the total light curve of bri  0021@xmath00214 obtained at the iac80 in 1996 august .",
    "the scatter in the differential photometry of bri  0021@xmath00214 in the iac80 data set is @xmath25 mag , which is a factor of three lower than that in the jkt data set ( @xmath26 mag ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the photometric errors in the iac80 data are larger due to the smaller aperture of the telescope and poorer image quality . in figure  5",
    "we plot the @xmath23 versus @xmath1-band magnitude ( denis system ) .",
    "the relation between these two quantities is not as good as for the jkt data .",
    "the standard deviation of the fit shown in figure  5 is 0.00316 mag ( compare with 0.0006 mag for the fit shown in figure  3 ) .",
    "this is probably because there are large psf variations across the ccd frames taken with the iac80 . bri00210214 and reference star 1 have a better psf than the average of the other reference stars because they are closer to the center of the chip .",
    "our differential photometry was obtained by averaging the fluxes of the reference stars , and this procedure gives more weight to the brighter sources .",
    "the reference star 1 is the brightest source .",
    "figure  5 indicates that photometric variability of bri  0021@xmath00214 with the same amplitude as in the 1995 jkt dataset ( @xmath26 mag ) can be ruled out in the iac80 dataset with a confidence of 2.5  @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the photometric variability of bri  0021@xmath00214 in the i - band appears to have decreased from 1995 november to 1996 august .",
    "in the next subsection we will show that this effect can be accounted for by a source of periodic modulation which was present in 1995 but vanished in 1996 .    since bri  0021@xmath00214 is redder than the reference stars , we checked for the presence of correlations between differential magnitude and airmass or seeing , which , if present , might indicate color - dependent differential photometric effects due to refraction and scattering in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we did not find any such correlation , as illustrated in figures 6 and 7 .",
    "we conclude that the variability of bri  0021@xmath00214 is likely to be intrinsic to the object , and not due to changes in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "we performed a period analysis of the data using a clean algorithm modified by one of us ( h. j. lehto , 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "for an earlier version of this method , see @xcite .",
    "the sampling in both the 1995 november and 1996 august data sets is such that the window function shows high sidelobes at small multiples of about 1d@xmath13 . in principle",
    ", these could create ambiguity in the determined period .",
    "because clean ( and any other deconvolution method ) contains inherently degenerate solutions , we ran several solutions with different values of the gain to get an idea of the stability of the solution .",
    "the solutions for our periodograms remained stable . in 1995",
    "november , bri  0021@xmath00214 shows a single strong peak with a frequency of 1.1898d@xmath13 , corresponding to a period of 0.8405 day .",
    "this peak has a pseudo - power about 2 orders of magnitude higher than the highest peak in the comparison star s cleaned periodogram ( fig .",
    "the amplitude of this peak is 0.018 mag , which is similar to the value of @xmath23 . in 1996",
    "august there is no sign of the 0.8405 day peak , but a new small cluster of peaks has appeared around 4.8842d@xmath13 ( corresponding to a period of 0.205  day ) .",
    "these peaks clearly have a lower amplitude than previously , and may represent a sinusoid - like variation with a modulated amplitude .",
    "there is also a small possibility that the dominant frequency of this variation is actually 4.0115d@xmath13 ( corresponding to a period of 0.249  day ) .",
    "the amplitude of the peak at @xmath27 day is 0.007 mag , which is similar to the photometric errors .",
    "the periodogram can , however , find a sinusoid of amplitude below the photometric uncertainty because the noise is spread over many frequencies in the power spectrum .",
    "figures  9 and 10 present the jkt light curve of bri  0021@xmath00214 folded with a period of 0.84 day . in the first figure , data points taken at different nights are given different symbols . in the second one",
    "the data points have been binned in groups of five and a sinusoid fit is overplotted .",
    "we note that around phase=0.5 the data seems to deviate from the sinusoidal function .",
    "each individual error bar corresponds to the standard deviation of a group of five points .",
    "figure  11 displays the iac80 light curve of bri  0021@xmath00214 folded with a period of 0.20 day .",
    "data points have been binned by 5 , as in figure  10 .",
    "the amplitudes of the sinusoidal fits are 0.022 mag for the jkt and 0.006 mag for the iac80 . after subtracting the 0.84 day sinusoidal fit from the jkt data",
    ", we searched for the 0.2 day period .",
    "the jkt residual photometry is plotted in phase with @xmath28 day in figure  12 .",
    "data points have been binned in groups of seven to increase the s / n ratio .",
    "the shape of the phased light curve suggests that the 0.2 day period may be present in the jkt data , although the amplitude is lower than the 0.84 day modulation .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of the 0.2 day sinusoidal fit to the jkt residuals is 0.006 mag , which coincides with the amplitude of the fit to the iac80 data .",
    "the presence of the 0.2 day photometric modulation in both the iac80 and jkt light curves of bri  0021@xmath00214 suggests that this is a long - lived modulation",
    ". could it be the rotation period ?",
    "the absolute magnitude and @xmath29 of bri  0021@xmath00214 are @xmath30 and 2,5002,000  k ( leggett et al . 1998 ) , respectively .",
    "another observational constraint is that lithium has been depleted from the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "according to the evolutionary models of @xcite , the lack of lithium rules out the possibility that the object is younger than 0.3  gyr and less massive than 0.06  @xmath31 . given these constraints ,",
    "the models predict that the radius of bri  0021@xmath00214 should be @xmath32 . for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35",
    "km  s@xmath13 , we get a period of 0.14  day , which is inconsistent with our periodogram analysis .",
    "the radius would have to be 0.14  @xmath18 to get a rotation period of @xmath28  day , which is inconsistent with the theory .",
    "we consider several hypotheses to explain this discrepancy .",
    "first , we consider the possibility of non - rotational line broadening .",
    "three different studies have derived @xmath36 independently by using high - resolution optical spectra @xcite .",
    "they all find values of about 40  km  s@xmath13 , and we have adopted the most recent one .",
    "the agreement between @xmath36 measurements obtained at different epochs indicates that the broadening is not due to an unresolved spectroscopic binary .",
    "bri  0021@xmath00214 does not have an unusual rotation among the sample of late m and l dwarfs that have been studied at high spectral resolution .",
    "it is unlikely that the broadening is due to any line formation effect , which should basically be the same for all dwarfs of similar gravity and temperature .",
    "second , we consider the possibility that the radius is about 30% larger than predicted by the models . recently , the radius of an extrasolar giant planet has been observed for the first time .",
    "the planet hd209458b has a radius about 40% larger than that of jupiter @xcite .",
    "the favored interpretation is that the radius has been puffed up by stellar insolation @xcite .",
    "the radius of bri  0021@xmath00214 , however , can not be increased in the same way because of the lack of a close main - sequence star . the lack of detected x - ray emission by rosat @xcite rules out the possibility that there is a compact relativistic primary , such as a black hole or neutron star .",
    "the effects of rotation have not yet been included in models of brown dwarfs .",
    "one possible effect in a fully convective object is a larger radius and a cooler central temperature @xcite .",
    "preliminary calculations by i. baraffe ( 2000 , private communication ) indicate , however , that the rotational distorsion in a fast - rotating 0.1  m@xmath37 star is small ( @xmath21% ) .",
    "our previous discussion has ruled out the possibility of problems with either the @xmath10sin@xmath11 or the theoretical radius .",
    "thus , we must address the evidence that bri  0021@xmath00214 presents periodic photometric variability with periods longer than the rotation period .",
    "cool stars are usually understood by analogy to the sun .",
    "periodic photometric variability in cool stars arises from the presence of dark spots , where the enhanced magnetic field suppresses convective energy transport and cools off the plasma to temperatures below that of the photosphere .",
    "early- and mid - m - type dwarfs have a high occurrence of h@xmath3 emission , light variability , and flares ( the by  dra syndrome ) , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the photometric periods of by dra stars are consistent with their expected rotation periods .",
    "the fraction of the bolometric luminosity that is emitted in the h@xmath3 line ( @xmath38 ) is @xmath39 for the active , photometrically variable , by  dra stars .",
    "many of these stars have photometric variability with an amplitude of 0.3 to 0.02 mag in the v - band @xcite .",
    "bri  0021@xmath00214 is rotating even faster than most by  dra stars , but it is not active .",
    "it has @xmath40 @xcite , which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the by  dra stars .",
    "magnetic flares can not account for the observed light changes because they happen @xmath167% of the time and are too weak to produce continuum light at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems unlikely that the source of photometric variability in bri  0021@xmath00214 is a magnetic field because most of the time there is no evidence for chromospheric or coronal cooling .",
    "@xcite recently presented results of an @xmath1-band search for variability in 21 late - m and l dwarfs .",
    "half of their objects present evidence for variability with amplitudes of 0.01 to 0.05 mag on timescales between 0.4 and 100 hr .",
    "clean periodograms found strong periodicities at about a few hours in some of the objects , but for other objects the variability did not seem to be periodic .",
    "for one object with observations obtained 1 year apart , no common period could be found .",
    "@xcite argued that the periodicities were due to long - lived surface features modulated with the rotation periods , and the absence of periodicities for other stars was due to surface features that evolved in brightness and physical size on timescales of a few hours to a few days .",
    "the surface inhomogeneities could plausibly be due to magnetically induced spots or plages , or dusty clouds .",
    "if magnetic fields produce surface features , we would expect that the amplitude of the photometric modulation may scale with the strength of h@xmath3 emission .",
    "we could also expect that photometric modulation becomes smaller for cooler objects , because they tend to be more inactive @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the amplitude of photometric modulation does not depend on spectral type from m6 through l5 . in figure  13",
    "we plot photometric variability ( @xmath23 ) versus h@xmath3 equivalent width ( ew@xmath41 ) of bri  0021@xmath00214 together with l dwarfs for which bailer - jones & mundt found evidence for variability . for these ultracool dwarfs",
    "there is no correlation between ew@xmath41 and the amplitude of photometric variability , suggesting that these two observables are not causally connected .",
    "we conjecture several possibilities to explain the pattern of variability in bri  0021@xmath00214 : ( a ) there is differential rotation in bri  0021@xmath00214 , however it would have to be extreme to explain the very long periodicity of 0.84  day ; ( b ) there are turbulent regions in bri  0021@xmath00214 reminiscent of jupiter s bands and zones .",
    "perhaps bright spots are lagging behind the mean rotation of the photosphere ; however , the period of 0.84  day seems again to be too extreme because jupiter s zonal velocities are moderate @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", this period may be related to a zonal oscillation .",
    "jupiter s great red spot has a zonal oscillation with a period of three months @xcite , and it is possible that an ultracool dwarf may have shorter zonal oscillation period ; ( c ) the fast rotation of bri  0021@xmath00214 ( almost three times faster than jupiter ) may produce instabilities related to strong coriolis forces .",
    "the instabilities may lead to wave motions typical of rotating fluids , similar to inertial waves or rossby waves e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the 0.2  day periodicity corresponds to a stable pulsation mode , but the 0.84  day periodicity can not be accounted for by stable pulsations ; ( d ) convection reaches the optically thin layers of ultracool dwarf atmospheres @xcite .",
    "coriolis forces and convective overshooting may push clouds of dust some distance beyond the theoretical radius of structural models . some cloud decks could reach out to significant altitudes with respect to the surface .",
    "they would be dragged by rotation , but they could lag behind the deeper layers .",
    "the photosphere of bri  0021@xmath00214 may not rotate as a solid body .",
    "the 0.2 and 0.84 day periods could arise from bright or dark clouds located high above the photosphere .",
    "we have monitored the brightness of the ultracool dwarf bri  0021@xmath00214 for 10 nights in 1995 november and 4 nights in 1996 august using @xmath1-band ccd imaging .",
    "bri  0021@xmath00214 has shown significant variability , particularly in 1995 .",
    "we find a surprisingly long modulation in the 1995 data set ( 0.84  day ) that can not be due to rotation .",
    "a clean periodogram of the 1996 data set gives a periodicity of 0.2  day .",
    "none of these two periods correspond to the expected rotation period ( @xmath20.14  day ) .",
    "since bri  0021@xmath00214 is a very inactive object with extremely low levels of h@xmath3 and x - ray emission , we favor the interpretation that the source of surface thermal inhomogeneities required to explain the photometric variability are clouds rather than magnetically induced spots .",
    "bri  0021@xmath00214 has weak tio bands , which is a sign of ti depletion by condensation onto grains .",
    "the atmosphere of bri  0021@xmath00214 is too warm for water to condense , but silicate and iron clouds are expected @xcite .",
    "theoretical models indicate that they play a key role in controlling opacity and temperature structure in the atmosphere .",
    "the rapid rotation and cool temperature of bri  0021@xmath00214 could make its surface appear more analogous to jupiter than to the sun .",
    "@xcite have simulated integrated light observations of jupiter at 400  nm ( @xmath42-band ) made by the _ hubble space telescope_. they find that the apparent magnitude could be modulated with jupiter s rotation period .",
    "the amplitude of the sinusoidal light curve would be about 0.04 mag , which is similar to the amplitudes found by us and @xcite .",
    "@xcite predict that the amplitude would be larger in the thermal emission regime .",
    "thus , near - infrared monitoring of bri  0021@xmath00214 and other ultracool dwarfs may be worthwhile .",
    "@xcite reported a search for variability using a tunable filter technique to measure changes in the strength of tio bands .",
    "@xcite discusses more techniques , such as long - slit spectra and narrowband imaging .",
    "we suggest that @xmath8-band observations could be particularly valuable to search for changes in the dust - induced greenhouse effect on the co bands .",
    "optical spectroscopic monitoring could test the hypothesis that the clouds are made of dust because the strengths of the tio bands should be variable .",
    "a report of possible variability of the resonance line in kelu  1 , an l2 dwarf , was made by @xcite .",
    "since the line is formed against a background of tio bands @xcite , the apparent variability of the atomic line could be due to variable tio opacity and/or variable continuum opacity .",
    "@xcite reported variability in the l dwarf gl  584  c in the 835975  nm region in timescales of days and years .",
    "we have briefly discussed four possible scenarios to explain the variability observed in bri  0021@xmath00214 : differential rotation ; bands and zones moving with different velocities ; pulsations ; and turbulent clouds located high above the photosphere . in any case , the variability of bri  0021@xmath00214 is more complicated than previously anticipated .",
    "simultaneous multiwavelength observations may shed light on what phenomena are responsible for the surprising photometric behaviour of bri  0021@xmath00214 .",
    "we thank the following people : isabelle baraffe for providing a digital version of the theoretical models used in this work , xavier delfosse for giving us denis photometric data , ted simon and an anonymous referee for providing insightful comments , and louise good for correcting the english language used in the manuscript .",
    "this paper is based on observations made with the 1 m jacobus kapteyn telescope operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) , and the 0.82 m telescope operated on the island of tenerife by the iac at the observatorio del teide .",

    "<S> we report ccd photometric monitoring of the nonemission ultracool dwarf bri  0021@xmath00214 ( m9.5 ) obtained during 10 nights in 1995 november and 4 nights in 1996 august , with ccd cameras at 1 m class telescopes on the observatories of the canary islands . </S>",
    "<S> we present differential photometry of bri  0021@xmath00214 , and we report significant variability in the @xmath1-band light curve obtained in 1995 . </S>",
    "<S> a periodogram analysis finds a strong peak at a period of 0.84  day . </S>",
    "<S> this modulation appears to be transient because it is present in the 1995 data but not in the 1996 data . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a possible period of 0.20  day , which appears to be present in both the 1995 and 1996 datasets . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not find any periodicity close to the rotation period expected from the spectroscopic rotational broadening ( @xmath20.14  day ) . </S>",
    "<S> bri  0021@xmath00214 is a very inactive object , with extremely low levels of h@xmath3 and x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is unlikely that magnetically induced cool spots can account for the photometric variability . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric variability of bri  0021@xmath00214 could be explained by the presence of an active meteorology that leads to inhomogeneous clouds on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of photometric modulation at the expected rotational period suggests that the pattern of surface features may be more complicated than previously anticipated . </S>"
