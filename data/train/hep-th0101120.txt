    "our original motivation to study correlators of the energy momentum tensor @xcite was the discovery that certain field theories admit concrete realizations as a string theory on a particular background @xcite .",
    "attempts to apply these correspondences to study the details of these theories have only met with limited success so far .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that this correspondence relates weakly coupled supergravity and strongly coupled sym theory .",
    "unfortunately we only have firm control of either theory in the weak coupling limit .",
    "the objective of our program is to improve this situation substantially .",
    "previously we showed that supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization ( sdlcq ) @xcite can be used to solve supersymmetric field theories in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "this then allowed us to make a quantitative comparison between the strongly coupled @xmath7 sym theory and the supergravity approximation of the string theory @xcite in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the sdlcq approach works particularly well in 1 + 1 dimensions ; however , it can be extended to more dimensions .",
    "recently , we solved for the spectrum and wave functions of @xmath8 sym in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .    aside from our numerical solutions , there has been very little work on solving sym theories using methods that might be described as being from first principles . while selected properties of these theories have been investigated",
    ", one needs the complete solution of the theory to calculate the correlators . by a `` complete solution '' we mean the spectrum and the wave functions of the theory in some well - defined basis .",
    "the sym theories that are needed for the correspondence with supergravity and string theory have typically a high degree of supersymmetry and therefore a large number of fields .",
    "the number of fields significantly increases the size of the numerical problem , and , therefore , in this first calculation of correlators in 2 + 1 dimensions we consider only @xmath8 sym .",
    "a convenient quantity that can be computed on both sides of the correspondence is the correlation function of a gauge invariant operator @xcite .",
    "we will focus on two - point functions of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this turns out to be a very convenient quantity to compute for reasons that are discussed in @xcite . following the procedure that we used in our calculation in 1 + 1 dimensions @xcite , we continue the results to euclidean space .",
    "the correlator of the energy momentum operator has been studied in conformal field theory in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite , and this provides a reference point for our results .",
    "the structure of the correlators in conformal field theory is particularly simple in the collinear limit @xmath9 , and we therefore find it convenient to work in this limit . from results in conformal field theory",
    "we expect that correlators behave as @xmath4 at small @xmath3 , where we are probing deep inside the bound states .",
    "we have confirmed this @xmath4 behavior by an analytic calculation of the free - particle correlator in the dlcq formalism @xcite .",
    "the contributions of individual bound states have a characteristic length scale corresponding to the size of the bound states . on dimensional grounds",
    "one can show that the power behavior of the correlators are reduced by one power of @xmath3 ; so for individual bound states the correlator behaves like @xmath10 for small @xmath3 .",
    "it then becomes a nontrivial check to see that at small @xmath3 the contributions of the bound states add up to give the expected @xmath4 behavior .",
    "we find this expected result as well as the characteristic rapid convergence of sdlcq at both small and intermediate values of @xmath3 .    at large @xmath3 the correlator",
    "is controlled by the massless states of the theory . in this theory",
    "there are two types of massless states . at zero coupling",
    "all the states of the @xmath11 dimensional theory are massless , and for non - vanishing coupling the massless states of the @xmath11 theory are promoted to massless states of the @xmath12 dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "these states are bps states and are exactly annihilated by one of the supercharges .",
    "this is perhaps the most interesting part of this calculation because the bps masses are protected by the exact supersymmetry of the numerical approximation and remain exactly zero at all couplings . commonly in modern field theory one uses the bps states to extrapolate from weak coupling to strong coupling .",
    "while the masses of bps states remain constant as functions of the coupling , their wave functions certainly do not .",
    "the calculation of the correlator at large @xmath3 provides a window to the coupling dependence of the bps wave functions .",
    "we find , however , that there is a critical coupling where the correlator goes to zero , which depends on the transverse resolution .",
    "a detailed study of this critical coupling shows that it goes to infinity linearly with the square root of the transverse resolution . below the critical coupling",
    "the correlator converges rapidly at large @xmath3 .",
    "one possible explanation is that this singular behavior signals the breakdown of the sdlcq calculation for the bps wave function at couplings larger than the critical coupling .",
    "if this is correct , calculation of the bps wave function at stronger couplings requires higher transverse resolutions .",
    "we note that above the critical coupling ( see fig .",
    "[ k5 + 6large ] below ) we do find convergence of the correlator at large @xmath3 but at a significantly slower rate .    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss light cone quantization and sdlcq .",
    "the correlators are discussed in section 3 for the free theory and in section 4 for the full theory . in section 5",
    "we discuss our numerical results .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in section 6 .",
    "the technique of dlcq is reviewed in @xcite , so we will be brief here .",
    "the basic idea of light - cone quantization is to parameterize space - time using light - cone coordinates @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and to quantize the theory such that @xmath13 plays the role of a time . in the discrete light - cone approach",
    ", we require the momentum @xmath16 along the @xmath14 direction to take on discrete values in units of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the conserved total momentum of the system and @xmath19 is an integer usually referred to as the harmonic resolution @xcite .",
    "one can think of this discretization as a consequence of compactifying the @xmath14 coordinate on a circle with a period @xmath20 .",
    "along the direction @xmath21 the transverse momentum is discretized as well ; however , it is treated in a fundamentally different way .",
    "the transverse resolution is @xmath22 , and we think of the theory as being compactified on a transverse circle of length @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the transverse momentum is cut off at @xmath24 and discretized in units of @xmath25 .",
    "removal of this transverse momentum cutoff therefore corresponds to taking the transverse resolution @xmath22 to infinity .",
    "the advantage of discretizing on the light cone is the fact that the dimension of the hilbert space becomes finite .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian is a finite dimensional matrix , and its dynamics can be solved explicitly . in sdlcq",
    "one makes the dlcq approximation to the supercharges , and these discrete representations satisfy the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "therefore sdlcq enjoys the improved renormalization properties of supersymmetric theories .",
    "of course , to recover the continuum result we must send @xmath19 and @xmath22 to infinity and , as luck would have it , we find that sdlcq usually converges faster than ordinary dlcq .",
    "faster convergence is important because the size of the matrices and , consequently , the difficulty of the computation grow as the resolution is increased .",
    "let us now review these ideas in the context of a specific super - yang - mills theory .",
    "we start with @xmath12 dimensional @xmath8 super - yang - mills theory defined on a space - time with one transverse dimension compactified on a circle .",

    "looking back at the calculation for the free particle , we see that there are two independent sums over transverse momentum , after the contractions are performed .",
    "one would expect that the transverse dimension is controlled by the dimensional scale of the bound state ( @xmath106 ) and therefore the correlation should scale like @xmath107 . however , because of transverse boost invariance , the matrix element must be independent of the difference of the transverse momenta and therefore must scale as @xmath108 .",

    "we find that the free - particle correlator behaves like @xmath4 , in agreement with results from conformal field theory .",

    "is dominated by the massless bps states of the theory .",
    "we find that as a function of @xmath115 the large-@xmath3 correlator has a critical value of @xmath115 where it abruptly drops to zero .",
    "we have investigated this singular behavior and find that at fixed longitudinal resolution the critical coupling grows linearly with @xmath116 .",
    "we conjecture that this critical coupling signals the breakdown of sdlcq at sufficiently strong coupling at fixed transverse resolution , @xmath22 .",
    "while this might not be surprising in general , it is surprising that the behavior appears in the bps wave functions and that we see no sign of this behavior in the massive states .",
    "we find that above the critical coupling the correlator still converges but significantly slower .",
    "it is unclear at this time if we should attach any significance to the correlator in this region .",
    "this calculation emphasizes the importance of bps wave functions which carry important coupling dependence , even though the mass eigenvalues are independent of the coupling .",
    "we will discuss the spectrum , the wavefunctions and associated properties of all the low energy bound states of @xmath8 sym in 2 + 1 dimensions in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "a number of computational improvements have been implemented in our code to allow us to make these detailed calculations .",
    "the code now fully utilizes the three known discrete symmetries of the theory , namely supersymmetry , transverse parity @xmath63 , eq .",
    "( [ parity ] ) , and the @xmath60 symmetry @xmath64 , eq .",
    "( [ z2 ] ) .",
    "this reduces the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix by a factor of 8 .",
    "other , more efficient storage techniques allow us to handle on the order of 2,000,000 states in this calculation , which has been performed on a single processor linux workstation .",
    "our improved storage techniques should allow us to expand this calculation to include higher supersymmetries without a significant expansion of the code or computational power .",
    "we remain hopeful that porting to a parallel machine will allow us to tackle problems in full 3 + 1 dimensions .",

    "<S> recent advances in string theory have highlighted the need for reliable numerical methods to calculate correlators at strong coupling in supersymmetric theories . </S>",
    "<S> we present a calculation of the correlator @xmath0 in @xmath1 sym theory in 2 + 1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical method we use is supersymmetric discrete light - cone quantization ( sdlcq ) , which preserves the supersymmetry at every order of the approximation and treats fermions and bosons on the same footing . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation is done at large @xmath2 . for small and intermediate @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> the correlator converges rapidly for all couplings . at small @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> the correlator behaves like @xmath4 , as expected from conformal field theory . at large @xmath3 the correlator </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by the bps states of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , a critical value of the coupling where the large-@xmath3 correlator goes to zero , suggesting that the large-@xmath3 correlator can only be trusted to some finite coupling which depends on the transverse resolution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this critical coupling grows linearly with the square root of the transverse momentum resolution .    </S>",
