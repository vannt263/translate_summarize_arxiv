    "globular clusters ( gc ) occupy a very special position in modern astrophysics . they provide the most stringent tests of stellar evolution theory , represent ideal templates for stellar population synthesis studies , allow age dating of galaxies with unrivaled precision , etc .",
    "the gc families of the milky way and its satellite galaxies , the magellanic clouds and the fornax dsph galaxy , have been thoroughly studied from both the ground and space , especially with hst .",
    "the next nearest major gc family belongs to m31 . to study individual stars in gc systems much more distant than m31",
    "will require the next generation of ground or space based telescopes .",
    "the gc systems of the the milky way and m31 appear to be quite similar in luminosity and color ranges @xcite .",
    "however , some of m31 s bulge globulars appear to have line strengths as strong as those of giant ellipticals , suggesting metallicities considerably greater than any known galactic globular @xcite . @xcite has also noted that m31 s gcs appear to follow different h@xmath9 and cn correlations with mg@xmath10 with respect to galactic globulars ; they attributed this to the whole m31 gc family being systematically younger . renzini ( 1986 ) pointed out that other interpretations were also possible , such as the chemical enrichment history of the two spheroids having proceeded with slightly different time scales , resulting in different element ratios .",
    "hst observations of m31 s gcs in the optical ( with the goal of stellar photometry ) started soon after the first refurbishing mission , with both foc and wfpc2 @xcite , and now include some of the most metal rich clusters @xcite .",
    "the study of metal rich m31 globulars complements similar studies of galactic bulge globulars within this still poorly known , yet crucial part of age - metallicity space .",
    "near - ir observations are essential to study the brightest giants in an old , metal rich population , especially to determine bolometric luminosities .",
    "metal rich globular and bulge giants , which are the brightest bolometrically and in the near - ir , are in contrast , many magnitudes fainter at optical wavelengths due to severe molecular blanketing . in extreme cases",
    ", @xmath5 can be as great as @xmath11 at the top of the agb @xcite and these stars are likely to have escaped detection in m31 even with wfpc2 .",
    "since the main sequences of the old populations in m31 are currently out of reach , one is forced to appeal to an alternative age indicator .",
    "theory predicts that the highest luminosity reached on the agb is a function of age @xcite , a prediction extensively verified by observations of clusters in the magellanic clouds @xcite . in metal",
    "poor galactic globulars , no stars are brighter than the theoretical rgb tip , as expected for a @xmath12 gyr population .",
    "however , the agb of more metal rich clusters ( [ fe / h]@xmath13 ) extends @xmath14 magnitude above the rgb @xcite , as it does in the galactic bulge @xcite . for clusters , though , these bright stars are all lpvs . for both clusters and bulge population",
    "these luminous stars are now generally ascribed to high metallicity , rather than to young age @xcite .",
    "hence , the presence of stars brighter than the rgb tip does not guarantee an intermediate age ; consideration of their color , luminosity _ and _ frequency in the parent population is required before drawing conclusions about ages @xcite .",
    "in cycle 7 we proposed to obtain nicmos @xmath15 images of 5 metal rich globular clusters in m31 . from these observations",
    ", we planned to achieve the following scientific goals : ( 1 ) explore the upper end of the gc luminosity function ; ( 2 ) derive independent estimates for the metallicity of the m31 clusters and their adjacent fields from the slope and location of the nir rgb @xcite ; ( 3 ) determine the frequency of luminous rgb and agb stars ( including lpvs ) per unit luminosity ; ( 4 ) compare the cluster results with observations of m31 field stars ( 5 ) compare the properties of the luminous stars in m31 s metal rich clusters to those in the galactic bulge and galactic globulars ; ( 6 ) integrate these results with optical photometry and spectroscopy and explore implications for stellar evolution theory and the interpretation of the integrated light of distant galaxies .",
    "one critical issue deserves special attention if any of these goals are to be attained : the effect of stellar crowding .",
    "we ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , have carefully analyzed the effects of blending on our nicmos data . through the creation of completely artificial clusters ,",
    "we have calculated threshold- and critical - blending limits for each cluster and surrounding field .",
    "these limits determine the proximity to each cluster where reliable photometry can be obtained .",
    "these simulations allow us to quantify and correct for the effects of blending on the gb slope and width at different surface brightness levels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] presents the reasons for selecting each cluster , and the details of the observations .",
    "section [ sec : data_reduction ] describes the reduction procedures , and gives a brief summary of the procedures and results on blending from paper i. section [ sec : photometry ] presents the integrated photometry of the clusters , the cmds and luminosity functions of the clusters and their surrounding fields , and metallicity estimates for g1 , g280 , and the g280 field .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "this cluster is of particular interest because of its high metallicity despite its large distance ( @xmath28 ) from the center of m31 .",
    "since it nearly fills a nic2 frame , we also observed a nearby field to estimate the background stellar contribution .",
    "it turns out that g1 is far enough from m31 s center that field star contamination is negligible , and our control field yielded only 2 stars over the entire @xmath29 dithered @xmath0-band field .",
    "our observations were taken with the nicmos camera 2 ( nic2 ) which has a plate scale of @xmath30 00757 pixel@xmath31 and a field of view of 194 on a side ( 376 arcsec@xmath32 ) .",
    "the nicmos focus was set at the compromise position 1 - 2 , which optimizes the focus for simultaneous observations with cameras 1 and 2 .",
    "all of our observations used the multiaccum mode @xcite because of its optimization of the detector s dynamic range and cosmic ray rejection .",
    "observations with nic1 will be described in a later paper concentrating on m31 s bulge .",
    "each of our targets was observed through three filters : f110w ( 0.81.4 ) , f160w ( 1.41.8 ) , and f222 m ( 2.152.30 ) .",
    "these filters are close to the standard ground - based @xmath33 , @xmath34 , & @xmath0 filters .",
    "the observation of each cluster spanned three orbits of hst , with @xmath35 minutes of observing per orbit .",
    "this yielded total integration times of 1920s in f110w , 3328s in f160w , and 2304s in f222 m ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we implemented a spiral dither pattern with 4 positions to compensate for imperfections in the infrared array .",

    "objects measured inside the critical - blending radius are undoubtedly blends , and although we plot them for completeness , they should be disregarded .",
    "since we want to use the slope of the gb to estimate metallicities @xcite , and the width of the gb to place limits on any spread in metallicity , we have investigated the effects of crowding on these quantities . at low surface brightnesses ( @xmath48 magnitudes",

    "this indicates a metallicity correction of @xmath121 dex is required to remove the effects of blending . applying this correction gives a final metallicity of @xmath122 for the g280 cluster .",
    "previous metallicity measurements for g280 are listed in table [ tab : g1_g280_metallicities ] , and the techniques were briefly discussed in  [ sec : g1 ] .",
    "these measurements cover a fairly large range , but our value is consistent with most .",
    "we also looked for a possible intrinsic color spread , and hence a metallicity spread in g280 .",
    "such a metallicity spread would not be too surprising , since g280 is also a very massive cluster , with a velocity dispersion which is actually higher than that of g1 @xcite .",
    "however , the dispersion in the measured colors is small , @xmath123 @xmath124 , @xmath125 @xmath126 , close to the spread expected solely from measurement errors .",
    "thus we conclude that , as for g1 , g280 does not show any significant metallicity spread .",
    "figure [ fig : gbs ] shows the linear fits to the g1 and g280 giant branches before and after the blending correction . also shown",
    "are three galactic globular clusters which cover a range in metallicities .",
    "this figure gives an idea of the relative positions of g1 and g280 in cmd space , as well as the magnitude and direction of the blending corrections applied to the gb slopes .",
    "the luminosity functions of the g1 ( short - dashed ) and g280 ( long - dashed ) clusters are shown in figure [ fig : cluster_lfs ] .",
    "they both appear to have a sharp cutoff at @xmath127 , which is consistent with what is observed in galactic globulars @xcite .",
    "we also show the galactic bulge lf measured by @xcite in baade s window ( solid ) which has a sharp cutoff at @xmath128 .",
    "the faint end of g280 drops off more quickly than that of g1 since it is closer to the nucleus of m31 and the background is higher , making it more difficult to detect fainter stars .",
    "the three central clusters ( g170 , g174 , & g177 ) are so compact that we were unable to extract any photometry of the cluster stars themselves . the star counts seem to indicate that the clusters were detected , but the detections occur in the regime where the effects of blending are considerable .",
    "thus for these three clusters we present only the calibrated field cmds in figure [ fig : centralcmds ] .",
    "we use the same blending criteria as the other clusters , developed in paper i. objects inside the critical - blending limit @xmath129 are plotted with half - size dots , and should be ignored .",
    "( see table [ tab : blend_radii ] for the specific radii of each cluster ) .",
    "these are the brightest and bluest stars on the upper rgb of each cluster .",
    "objects located inside the threshold - blending limit @xmath130 are plotted with open circles , and should be considered dubious , note that nearly all the stars in the g174 and g177 clusters are such dubious measurements .",
    "we provide a linear fit to the gb measured in the g170 field , but do not attempt to estimate a metallicity , as the effects of blending are greater than we feel comfortable trying to correct .    as is evident from the radial surface brightness plots in figure [ fig : surface_brightness ] , the stellar density of these central fields is exceedingly high .",
    "g174 is the closest to the the nucleus of m31 , and g177 is only slightly farther away , but lies along m31 s major axis .",
    "the surface brightness of these two clusters never drops below the threshold blending limit .",
    "we are therefore skeptical of this photometry , and do not provide gb fits .",
    "the artificial cluster a177 ( the analog of g177 ) , revealed brightening even in the field of up to 0.6 magnitudes at @xmath0 due to blending .",
    "figure [ fig : fieldlfs ] shows the scaled luminosity functions for the fields surrounding the cluster observations .",
    "the g1 field is not included as it is assumed that almost all of the stars are cluster members since only 2 were found in the nearby control field .",
    "the g280 field includes all stars that are greater than @xmath111 from the cluster center .",
    "for the central clusters , we plot everything outside their threshold - blending radii , which are listed in table [ tab : blend_radii ] .",
    "all the field lfs look approximately the same , allowing for differences in the faint end due to varying levels of incompleteness .",
    "they all have an upper limit of @xmath131 , similar to what has been measured in the galactic bulge where @xcite observed a sharp break at @xmath132 and stars trailing off to @xmath133 .",
    "these observations imply that the bulge of m31 has a stellar population not significantly younger than that in baade s window , contrary to some previous observations .",
    "we will address this issue in more detail when we present our nicmos data targeted at m31 s bulge      of all the field observations , the g280 field is the least crowded , and the only one where we feel comfortable performing a giant branch analysis .",
    "the field cmd is shown in the center panel of figure [ fig : g280cmd ] .",
    "the linear fit to the gb , rejecting points fainter than @xmath86 and @xmath87 , as well as @xmath134 deviants , is shown at the top of the panel .",
    "the slope of the gb is @xmath135 , which yields a metallicity of @xmath136 from the relation of @xcite .",
    "the average surface brightness of the field is @xmath137 , which requires a metallicity correction of @xmath138 dex to compensate for the effects of blending ( see  [ sec : blending_analysis ] ) .",
    "thus our final estimate of the metallicity of the g280 field is @xmath139 .",
    "the large error associated with the field metallicity estimate is not due to measurement errors , but rather to the very large spread in color .",
    "the dispersion in the @xmath106 color is @xmath140 , and the dispersion in the @xmath1 color is @xmath141 , both of which are significantly larger than the measurement errors . this spread in color is most likely due to a true spread in metallicity .",
    "such a spread is not unexpected , since this field samples both the disk and bulge populations .",
    "@xcite have empirically determined a relationship between the gb @xmath1 color at @xmath142 and the cluster metallicity using 12 galactic globulars with [ fe / h ] @xmath143 .",
    "this relation has been recently revised by @xcite using 10 ggcs with more accurate distances : [ fe / h ] @xmath144 .",
    "the measured spread in @xmath1 for the m31-g280 field is @xmath145 in the range @xmath146 .",
    "we estimate the @xmath1 spread due to measurement errors as @xmath147 ( also the spread measured in g1 ) .",

    "the measured spread in @xmath106 is @xmath140 in the range @xmath152 .",
    "we estimate the spread in @xmath106 due to measurement errors is @xmath153 ( also the spread measured in g1 ) .",

    ". however , the luminosity function of this field looks very similar to those obtained in our fields in the bulge of m31 . in this section , we estimate the disk contribution to this field , and an age for this disk component based on the luminosity of the brightest agb stars .",
    "to find the relative contributions of the disk and bulge , we use the bulge  disk decomposition of @xcite .",
    "we take the position of g280 as @xmath27 from the center of m31 , and 34  from the major axis .",
    "an interpolation of kent s data shows that g280 s position corresponds to a major axis distance of @xmath156 , where the @xmath157-band surface brightness is @xmath158 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath25 .",
    "the decomposition reveals that 85% of the flux is from the disk ( @xmath159 ) , and 15% is from the bulge ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "thus the stellar population of the disk should be well represented in the g280 field .    to estimate the age of the disk stars in our field ,",
    "we first convert our @xmath0-band measurements to bolometric luminosities using the corrections of @xcite .",
    "these corrections use the @xmath1 color , and we apply their m - star correction since this is a relatively high metallicity field .",
    "the results show that the brightest stars are mostly fainter than @xmath161 .    assuming that these few bright stars are members of a young population",
    ", we can estimate the age of this population using the relationship between agb tip luminosity and age .",
    "first used by @xcite , this relation makes use of the monotonically decreasing maximum luminosity of the tagb with age .",
    "theoretically this relation is valid only for populations which are homogeneous in age and chemical composition , certainly not what we are observing in this field .",
    "however , as we will show , the dependence with metallicity is small ( see fig [ fig : mboltagb ] ) , and we are only trying to estimate the age of the youngest stars from the brightest observed @xmath162 . due to the limited number of stars in our field , and the short lifetime at the tagb , this estimate is only an upper limit to the age of the youngest stars .    we have calculated this relation using the zvar synthetic cmd code of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for descriptions ) to produce a synthetic cmd with constant sfr from 15 gyr to 7 myr ago , and metallicity increasing linearly with time using the @xcite stellar evolution models .",
    "we have used the mass - loss prescription of @xcite , ( see @xcite for a discussion on the effects of different mass loss prescriptions on the agb morphology of cmds of composite stellar populations ) .",
    "of all the parameters used , mass loss is the one that has the strongest effect on the magnitude of the tagb as a function of age .",
    "this relation differs from that derived by @xcite in which they use a mass loss treatment as parameterized by @xcite with @xmath163 . at any given age",
    ", our predicted tagb is @xmath164 mag fainter ( fig [ fig : mboltagb ] ) , and as a consequence we are deriving younger ages for stars of the same apparent magnitude .",
    "figure [ fig : mboltagb ] illustrates our results for several different scenarios",
    ". as previously stated , all cases use constant sfr from 15 gyr to 7 myr ago , metallicity increasing linearly with time and the @xcite stellar evolution models .",
    "the first three lines listed in the legend all use the newer mass loss prescription of @xcite , and show the relative insensitivity of the tagb luminosity to binary fraction and metallicity . the first model ( long dash )",
    "has z increasing from 0.0003 to 0.003 with no binaries .",
    "the second model ( short dash ) has the same metallicity , but now with 25% binaries .",
    "the third ( short / long dash ) has z increasing from 0.002 to 0.01 with no binaries .",
    "we fit these three models with a smooth polynomial and plot it with a solid line .",
    "it is this fitted relation ( @xmath165 ) which we use to estimate the age of the youngest stars in the g280 field . for comparison",
    "we show the luminosity  age relation of @xcite which uses mass loss from @xcite .",
    "we have also run our low - metallicity , no binaries model using the reimers mass loss prescription , and it falls on the @xcite relation .",
    "this verifies that the primary difference is indeed the treatment of mass - loss .    using the relation just developed , we estimate the age of the youngest stars in the g280 field . considering only the single measurement of the bolometric luminosity of the brightest star in our field of @xmath166 , we estimate an age of @xmath167 gyr .",
    "one can also attempt to statistically estimate the tip of the agb using the technique of @xcite . in this case one",
    "averages the stellar luminosities brighter than @xmath168 , and assuming that the distribution of stars along the agb is uniform , the peak luminosity is twice the mean .",
    "following this procedure , we average the ( two ) stars brighter than @xmath168 and find a mean of @xmath169 . which leads to an agb tip luminosity of @xmath170 for a fully populated agb .",
    "according to our relation derived from the stellar models , this implies an age of @xmath171 gyr for the disk stars in this field .",
    "thus we conclude that the youngest component of this field can be as young as 1 - 2 gyr based on the luminosities of the brightest giants .",
    "although the measured gb color of the g280 field is very similar to that of baade s window , it is not inconsistent with having a small component of the population as young as 2 gyr .",
    "this is because the gb color is not very sensitive to age .",
    "our models show that at @xmath172 the @xmath1 color only changes by @xmath173 going from 10gyr to 2gyr .",
    "this is confirmed by the yale isochrones using the lejeune color tables to get infrared colors .",
    "we first present surface brightness profiles of all clusters , and with the blending analysis presented in paper i , determine radial photometric limits for each cluster .",
    "we then give integrated photometry of all clusters except g1 , which was not fully on the detector .",
    "for the g1 cluster , we present the infrared cmd , and estimate the metallicity as [ fe / h]@xmath174 from the slope of the giant branch . based on the width of the giant branch , which shows no significant spread in color over what is expected from measurement errors alone @xmath175 , we conclude that there is no significant metallicity spread in the cluster .",
    "we combine our infrared observations of g1 with two epochs of optical @xmath4-band hst - wfpc2 data , revealing that several of the brightest stars in the cluster are lpvs .",
    "the shape and position of the gb in the @xmath0-@xmath5 cmd are similar to that of m107 , indicating a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath176 .",
    "however since the infrared gb slope technique uses such a small range in luminosity , we place more weight on the higher value from the optical - infrared cmd .    for the g280 observations , we divide the frame into cluster and field at @xmath111 from the cluster center .",
    "we statistically subtract the field population from the cluster , and present both the cluster and field cmds .",
    "fitting the giant branch , we find a cluster metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath177 . as in g1",
    ", we see no evidence for a metallicity spread in the cluster based on the width of the gb @xmath178 .",
    "fitting the gb of the g280 field , we find a metallicity of @xmath179 .",
    "the large error on the metallicity is indicative of the large color spread , which we estimate to be @xmath8 } \\sim 0.5 $ ] dex from the width of the gb .",
    "this is not surprising , since this field has contributions from both the disk ( 85% ) and bulge ( 15% ) .",
    "what is surprising is that , in this field which is 85% disk , we see no obviously bright , young stars . using the brightest star in the field as the tip of the agb , at @xmath180 , we estimate an age of @xmath181 gyr . however , if the disk component were this young , we would expect to see @xmath182 stars brighter than @xmath183 , but we see only 7 .",
    "a more likely scenario is that there are just a few young disk stars in the field , while the majority of the disk population is closer to @xmath184 gyr , thus lowering the agb tip to @xmath185 .",
    "the three central clusters , g170 , g174 & g177 , are all too compact to extract cluster star photometry .",
    "we thus present the field cmds and luminosity functions without trying to separate the cluster and field star contributions .",
    "the surface brightness of the g170 field is within acceptable limits , so we perform a linear fit to the gb , but do not try to estimate the metallicity , as the blending correction would be uncomfortably large .",
    "the g174 and g177 fields , on the other hand , are both above the threshold - blending surface brightness limit .",
    "this implies that measurements of all but the brightest stars in these fields are potentially affected by blending , so we refrain from even fitting their gbs .",
    "finally we presented the cluster ( g1 and g280 ) and field luminosity functions with the lf measured in baade s window .",
    "the luminosity functions of g1 and g280 both have a sharp bright - end cutoff at @xmath186 , consistent with observations of galactic globulars .",
    "the fields surrounding the clusters have lfs which are indistinguishable from that measured in the galactic bulge .",
    "thus , at least in the fields observed , there is no significant population of young luminous stars in the bulge of m31 .",
