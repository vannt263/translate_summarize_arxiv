    "stars with masses @xmath0 have short kelvin times that enable them to reach the main sequence while they are still accreting @xcite .",
    "the resulting nuclear burning leads to a huge luminosity , which produces a correspondingly large radiation pressure force on dust grains suspended in the incoming gas .",
    "this force can exceed the star s gravitational pull , possibly halting accretion and setting an upper limit on the star s final mass .",
    "early spherically symmetric calculations suggested that this phenomenon sets an upper limit on stellar masses of @xmath1 , @xcite for typical galactic metallicities .",
    "more recent non - spherical calculations have loosened that constraint by considering the role of accretion disks @xcite .",
    "disks reduce the effects of radiation pressure by concentrating the incoming matter into a smaller solid angle , increasing its ram pressure .",
    "they also absorb stellar radiation in a thin ring and re - radiate it isotropically , casting a shadow of reduced radiation pressure .",
    "even with a disk , however , radiation pressure can still be a significant barrier to accretion .",
    "@xcite were able to form a 50 @xmath2 star only if it had a thin accretion disk with a radius @xmath3 au .",
    "simulations by @xcite in 2d found limiting masses of @xmath4 before radiation pressure reversed the inflow .",
    "however , observations show that considerably more massive stars exist , and their formation mechanism remains uncertain",
    ".    recent observations of massive protostars have added an element to this picture .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite report interferometric measurements showing outflows from massive protostars with collimation factors of @xmath5 up to @xmath6 .",
    "they conclude that high and low mass outflows have similar collimation factors , typically @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "( the collimation factor is the ratio of the outflow s length to its width . )",
    "@xcite show that the momentum of co outflows driven by massive stars scales with the bolometric luminosity of the source in the same manner as for low mass stars . from these observations ,",
    "the natural conclusion is that low and high mass stellar outflows have a common driving mechanism and similar morphologies .",
    "previous theoretical work on massive star formation did not include the effects of outflows , and therefore assumed that the stellar radiation was either isotropic ( e.g. jijina and adams 1996 ) or had only those anisotropies induced by the presence of a disk ( e.g. yorke and sonnhalter 2002 ) . in this letter , we calculate radiative transfer through dense envelopes accreting onto massive protostars , and we study the effects of outflow cavities in the envelopes on the radiation field . in   [ models ]",
    "we present our models for radiative transfer and for the protostellar environment .",
    "we then present the results of our calculations in   [ results ] and discuss conclusions in   [ conclusions ] .",
    "we used the monte carlo / diffusion radiative transfer code written by @xcite to find the temperature distribution of gas in a circumstellar envelope .",
    "the opacity comes from dust grains , which are thermally well - coupled to the gas in the high density envelope @xcite .",
    "the grain size distribution depends on the location in the flow .",
    "the stellar spectrum is a kurucz model atmosphere . rather than discuss the code , grain , and stellar spectral models here , we refer readers to @xcite , and to   [ outflow ] for a discussion of opacity in the outflow.we used @xmath8 photons , sufficient to produce high signal - to - noise spectra .    to calculate the radiation force on the gas , we begin with the temperature distribution determined by the monte carlo code . from a given position , we pick ray directions based on the healpix scheme @xcite . along each ray , we solve the transfer equation for emission and absorption by dust grains to obtain @xmath9 , the specific intensity coming from direction @xmath10 .",
    "we also perform this calculation along a ray to the star itself . once we have found the intensity along each ray , we compute the flux @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of rays .",
    "we increase @xmath12 until the change in flux is less than 2.5% between iterations .",
    "we then integrate over frequency to obtain the radiation force per unit mass , @xmath13 .",
    "we ignore scattering when calculating the force ( but not the temperature ) .",
    "scattering of ir photons is negligible .",
    "uv and visible photons can scatter significantly , but for the fiducial envelope and star we use , photons at the peak of the stellar spectrum are all reprocessed into ir in the inner few au of the envelope .",
    "( in the disk the distance is vastly smaller . ) outside this layer , neglecting scattering does not change the radiation pressure force . for the same reason , the choice of stellar spectrum model is relevant only in the inner few au of the envelope .      to study the effects of outflow cavities , we choose a single fiducial model for the star , disk , and envelope , and vary the properties of the outflow .",
    "we place an @xmath14 @xmath2 zero - age main sequence star in a 50 @xmath2 envelope .",
    "the zams models of @xcite , predict a radius , surface temperature , and luminosity of @xmath15 @xmath16 , @xmath17 k , and @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite predict a formation time of @xmath20 yr for such a star , so we adopt an accretion rate of @xmath21 @xmath2 yr@xmath22 .",
    "the accretion luminosity is @xmath23 , negligible in comparison to the central star .",
    "although the cores that form massive stars are probably turbulent @xcite , for simplicity we adopt a simple rotationally flattened density distribution given by @xcite @xmath24^{-1 } \\\\",
    "u_r & = & -\\left(\\frac{2 g { m_{*}}}{r}\\right)^{1/2 } \\left(1+\\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\cos\\theta_0}\\right)^{1/2 } \\\\ \\label{tsc2 } \\frac{{r_{\\rm cen}}}{r } & = & \\frac{\\cos\\theta_0 - \\cos\\theta } { \\sin^2\\theta_0 \\cos\\theta_0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 is the legendre polynomial , @xmath26 and @xmath27 give the position in the envelope in spherical coordinates , and @xmath28 is the centrifugal radius of the flow .",
    "the gas at position @xmath29 was at angle @xmath30 when it began falling toward the star , where @xmath30 is given implicitly by ( [ tsc2 ] ) .",
    "the centrifugal radius @xmath28 is determined by the angular momentum of material arriving at the star . when the last material in the core accretes , it is roughly @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the ratio of the core s rotational kinetic energy to gravitational binding energy and for most cores @xmath33 @xcite . since our core is half accreted , we take @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore adopt values of @xmath35 pc and @xmath36 au , which give the correct mass in the envelope and satisfy @xmath34 .",
    "in addition to the envelope , our star has a disk of radius @xmath28 .",
    "observations of disks around massive stars are limited , and we therefore adopt a disk mass of @xmath37 based on the consideration that a disk more massive of order 10% of the central object is likely to be subject to gravitational instabilities @xcite that will cause matter to accrete until marginal stability is restored .",
    "we model the disk surface density and scale height as power laws @xmath38 , @xmath39 au .",
    "we base the choice @xmath40 on images from simulations of massive star formation ( e.g. yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ) which show disks with little or no flaring .",
    "we can partially describe the outflow cavity from observations . as discussed in ",
    "[ intro ] , high mass outflows have collimation factors from @xmath7 , similar to low mass stars .",
    "this corresponds to half - angles from @xmath41 , including the uncertain inclination .",
    "we therefore test opening angles of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "unfortunately , observations constrain only the asymptotic opening angle when the outflow is far from its parent core .",
    "cavity walls from nearby low mass sources seen in near - ir are generally curved when viewed on sufficiently small scales ( e.g. padgett et al 1999 and reipurth et al 2000 ) .",
    "this curvature is a natural result of outflow collimation by the rotationally - flattened envelope @xcite . for massive protostars that are still embedded in dense envelopes ,",
    "near - ir observations are impossible due to dust extinction .",
    "millimeter observations , even with interferometers , are unable to probe length scales comparable to the size of the protostellar disk , at which we expect the strongest collimation and curvature . following @xcite , therefore , we parameterize the uncertain shape of the cavity as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the vertical distance from the star , @xmath47 is the distance from the outflow axis , and @xmath48 is a constant chosen to give an opening angle of @xmath49 at the edge of the core .",
    "we try values of @xmath50 , 1.5 , and 2.0 , coupled with a fixed wind opening angle @xmath51 , to study the effects of variations in cavity shape . as a baseline",
    ", we also study a case with no outflow cavity .",
    "some gas at the outflow base will be ionized by the star s uv flux ( tan & mckee , in preparation ) . whether the ionized gas remains near the star depends on the outflow s structure at its base , where the density is highest and recombinations are fastest .",
    "if the outflow is ionized , it will be too hot to contain dust grains , and its opacity will come primarily from resonant scattering by metal ions @xcite .",
    "this is a complex subject beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we simply note that the opacity produced by this scattering must be far smaller than that produced by dust grains in the envelope . in the case",
    "that the outflow cavity is ionized , we may therefore set the opacity in the cavity to zero .",
    "if the outflow is neutral , grains will re - form , growing in radius @xmath52 at rate ( cf .",
    "hoyle 1946 ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass fraction of the element of which the grain is composed , @xmath55 is the thermal velocity of gaseous atoms of that element , @xmath56 is the gas density , and @xmath57 is the grain density .",
    "growth is fastest for carbon grains , since carbon is the most abundant refractory metal in the galactic ism and has a large thermal velocity due to its low atomic mass .",
    "@xcite estimate its mass fraction to be @xmath58 .",
    "grains can only condense below the dust destruction temperature of @xmath59 k , so @xmath60 km s@xmath22 .",
    "the density of carbon grains is @xmath61 g @xmath62 . for our adopted cavity shape ,",
    "the wind density at a distance @xmath46 from the equatorial plane must be roughly @xmath63 $ ] , where @xmath64 is the wind velocity ( taken to be constant ) and @xmath65 is the fraction of mass reaching the star that is ejected into the wind . we take @xmath66 and @xmath67 km s@xmath22 @xcite , where @xmath68 is the keplerian velocity at the stellar surface .",
    "the smallest distance at which grains can form is the dust destruction radius , which we calculate to be @xmath69 au for our fiducial model",
    ". we may therefore integrate ( [ graingrowth1 ] ) from @xmath70 to @xmath71 to obtain the maximum size that grains can attain before escaping the core .",
    "the largest grain sizes occur for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which gives @xmath74 @xmath75 m  in effect , grains can not grow past the size of molecules .",
    "in contrast , the typical grain sizes in the envelope are @xmath76 @xmath75 m .",
    "stellar and envelope radiation has wavelengths @xmath77 , so grain opacity scales as @xmath78 .",
    "thus , even if all the c goes into grains , the opacity in the outflow is smaller than that in the envelope by at least a factor of @xmath79 .",
    "if we included cooling of the outflow and evaluated the grain size at radii smaller than @xmath71 , the reduction would be even larger .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that dust opacity in a neutral outflow is negligible in comparison to the opacity in the infalling envelope .",
    "since for either a neutral or an ionized outflow the opacity is negligible , we set the opacity in the outflow cavity to zero in our calculations .",
    "we show the gas temperature distribution for each of our models in figure [ tempmap ] .",
    "although our core extends to 0.22 pc , we concentrate on the inner few thousand au , where the radiation pressure force is strongest .",
    "the plot shows that , in models with a cavity , the gas is hotter on the inside edge of the outflow cavity but is cooler elsewhere . since , due to rotational flattening , most of the gas is attempting to accrete close to the equatorial plane , this means that the bulk of the accreting gas is cooler in runs with an outflow .",
    "the effect is stronger for outflow cavities with larger opening angles , and for cavities that are wider at their base .",
    "we show the radiation pressure force versus radius at angles of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 from the pole in figure [ angplot ] .",
    "consistent with the reduced temperature , the radiation pressure force is also substantially smaller in runs with an outflow cavity . for our `` intermediate '' model with @xmath51 , @xmath73 , the radiation pressure force is smaller than in the run with no cavity by a factor of up to 4.6 . for the other runs ,",
    "the peak reductions in radiation force were factor of 1.7 ( @xmath83 , @xmath73 ) , 14.4 ( @xmath84 , @xmath73 ) , 4.2 ( @xmath51 , @xmath50 ) , and 7.2 ( @xmath51 , @xmath85 ) .",
    "thus , the amount by which the wind cavity reduces radiation pressure shows moderate dependence on the wind curvature and opening angle , but for only one combination of parameters was the reduction less than a factor of 4 . comparing radiation and gravitational forces , it is clear that this reduction can mean the difference between accretion halting or continuing .    to check how the results depend on properties of the envelope , which has a comparatively low surface density compared to most high - mass cores , we re - ran the intermediate and no cavity cases with identical @xmath28 and @xmath71 , but a 100 @xmath2 envelope .",
    "the case with no wind cavity showed little change in force with envelope mass . with a cavity ,",
    "the increased envelope mass decreased the radiation pressure force at equatorial angles so that radiation was stronger than gravity only at @xmath86 , increasing the fraction of solid angle through which accretion could occur .",
    "thus , our results likely represent a _ lower limit _ on the reduction in radiation pressure force that outflow cavities actually produce .    to determine how the effect of the cavity compares to that produced by the disk and the rotationally - flattened envelope alone",
    ", we also considered a spherical envelope , with no cavity , no disk , and @xmath87 in ( [ tsc1])-([tsc2 ] ) .",
    "we compared this to the run with our fiducial disk and envelope parameters and no cavity . at angles",
    "@xmath88 , the radiation pressure force in the spherical case was a factor of a few higher , while at angles @xmath89 it was comparable or smaller . thus , our intermediate wind cavity reduces the radiation pressure force relative to the disk - and - envelope only case by about the same amount that the disk - and - envelope case reduces it relative to purely spherical .",
    "collimation of the radiation field by the disk and envelope and collimation by the outflow cavity are about equally important , and reinforce each other .",
    "together , they reduce the radiation pressure force in the intermediate cavity case by a factor of @xmath6 relative what one would find for an isotropic radiation field .    in all our tests , the degree of radiation collimation is roughly consistent with expectations .",
    "tan & mckee ( in preparation ) show that the fraction of radiation escaping an envelope through a path of optical density @xmath90 is proportional to @xmath91 . in our case ,",
    "the flux fraction escaping from the core at angles between @xmath27 and @xmath92 should roughly satisfy @xmath93^{-1 } d\\left[\\cos(\\theta)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the optical depth at angle @xmath27 .",
    "there is considerably uncertainty in applying this to our problem because @xmath94 is frequency - dependent .",
    "however , if we use the rosseland mean opacity at @xmath95 k , then at most angles ( [ fluxfrac ] ) predicts roughly the correct flux fraction .",
    "we have shown that an outflow can substantially change the radiation field , and radiation pressure , around a massive protostar .",
    "the outflow cavity provides an optically thin channel through which radiation can escape , significantly reducing the radiation pressure . with no wind cavity , in our fiducial model",
    "the radiation pressure force is stronger than gravity essentially everywhere except inside the accretion disk , and it is therefore likely that accretion would be halted . in our intermediate model , outside the centrifugal radius radiation is weaker than gravity over about @xmath96 sr , providing a large funnel through which accretion can continue .",
    "the calculation we have performed here is only a proof of principle , and we are currently performing 3-d radiation hydrodynamic amr simultions .",
    "our results strongly argue , however , that the presence of outflows provides a mechanism for circumventing the radiation pressure limit to protostellar accretion .",
    "surprisingly , outflows that drive gas out of a collapsing envelope may increase rather than decrease the size of the final , massive star .",
