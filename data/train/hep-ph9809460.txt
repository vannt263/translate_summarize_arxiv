    "one of the most difficult and less understood problems in quantum field theory is the treatment of bound state systems . even in qed where the interaction is simply given in perturbation theory ,",
    "the practical calculation of the bound state properties is tricky .",
    "the complication comes from the mixing of the many characteristic scales of the bound state , the mass of the particles , the momentum and the energy of the state . a way to handle this problem",
    "is provided by non relativistic qed ( nrqed ) which is an effective theory equivalent to qed and obtained from qed by integrating out the hard energy scale @xmath1 .",
    "the ultraviolet regime of qed ( at energy scale @xmath1 ) is perturbatively encoded order by order in the coupling constant @xmath2 in the matching coefficients that appear in front of the operators in the effective lagrangian .",
    "each term in the effective lagrangian has a definite power counting in @xmath2 and then a disentangling of the various scales is achieved .",
    "a similar simplification is obtained using non relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) in heavy quark systems .",
    "these systems are characterized by a dynamical dimensionless parameter , the quark velocity @xmath3 , which is small and allows a classification of the energy scales of the problem in hard ( @xmath4 ) , soft ( @xmath5 ) and ultrasoft ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this provides a power counting scheme . here",
    ", however , a further and conceptual difficulty arises in connection with the nonperturbative nature of low - energy qcd .",
    "the relation between @xmath3 and the qcd parameters is unknown but certainly @xmath3 includes both perturbative and nonperturbative effects .",
    "therefore , the evaluation of the bound state properties is ultimately done with a lattice simulation . in the case of bound systems with at least one light quark simplifications of this type",
    "do not hold .",
    "on one hand no small expansion parameter exists , on the other hand the light quark mass is generated via chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "hence , the interplay between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking has to be considered .    in this talk",
    "we report about recent progress in the treatment of bound states in qcd .",
    "we show that it is possible to obtain a model - independent and gauge - invariant result for the heavy quark interaction at order @xmath7 of the systematic expansion in @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction turns out to be simply given in terms of a generalized ( distorted ) wilson loop .",
    "the result is suitable for lattice evaluation as well as for analytic evaluation once a qcd vacuum model is considered .",
    "we show that the results for the heavy quark dynamics are substantially under control and are given in terms of two nonperturbative parameters @xmath8 , the gluon correlation length , and @xmath9 , the gluon condensate . adopting the same framework in order to study the heavy - light bound states in the non - recoil limit , spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and a confining chiral non - invariant interaction emerge quite naturally .",
    "we discuss this last case with more details .",
    "the heavy quark interaction can be obtained analytically at the order @xmath7 of the systematic expansion of the interaction in @xmath3 . here , we report only the main steps of the derivation referring to @xcite for further details .    * _ step 1_. set up the nrqcd lagrangian .",

    ", we can compare unambiguously the predictions for the heavy quark interaction obtained in various qcd vacuum models and the lattice measures as well as the phenomenological data .",

    "wants to exploit all the available lattice information on the mechanism of confinement and all the measurements of the wilson loop .",
    "let us consider the v.e.v . of the wilson loop .",
    "it pays to expand this average in terms of field strength expectation values , by using the non - abelian stokes theorem @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 denotes a surface with contour @xmath34 and @xmath59 stands for the cumulant average . in principle , the v.e.v . of the wilson loop",
    "is given by the sum of all the cumulants .",
    "however , in a recent lattice investigation ( @xcite and refs . therein ) , evidence of the gaussian dominance in the cumulant expansion of quasi - static wilson loop averages was found .",
    "therefore , it follows that @xmath60 is a good approximation .",
    "this is the basic assumption in the ( gaussian ) stochastic vacuum model @xcite and it was phenomenologically confirmed by calculation in high energy scattering and quarkonia .",
    "then , the heavy quark interaction is determined by the two - point field strength correlator @xmath61 the lorentz decomposition is general and the dynamics is contained in the form factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "@xcite , the qcd two  point field strength correlator ( [ due ] ) has been related to the dual field propagator of the effective abelian higgs model describing infrared qcd . in this way",
    "the gaussian dominance in the wilson loop average is understood as following from the classical approximation in the dual theory .",
    "moreover , it is possible to relate the qcd parameter @xmath8 and @xmath9 to the dual parameters . in the london limit @xmath8",
    "is identified with the dual gluon mass @xmath68 , without the london limit the relation is more involved but still @xmath8 is expressed in terms of the dual theory parameters .    from the calculation of the heavy quark interaction in various model of the qcd vacuum ( minimal area law model @xcite , stochastic vacuum model @xcite , dual qcd @xcite , isgur and paton model @xcite ) we can state that :    *   all these models give the same result for the nonperturbative heavy quark interaction not only in the long range regime but also in the transition region . *   two nonperturbative parameters , that can be related to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , control the nonperturbative interaction . *   all these models predict the eichten - feinberg nonperturbative spin interaction ( pure thomas precession ) in the limit @xmath69 . in the transition region",
    "there is a subleading correction to the spin - interaction coming from the magnetic interaction . *",
    "all these models predict the nonperturbative velocity dependent corrections to be proportional to the flux tube angular momentum .",
    "this prediction is definitively different from the result obtained with the semi - relativistic reduction of bethe - salpeter kernels of the type @xmath70 , ( @xmath71 being the momentum transfer ) with any lorentz structure , see @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that we need two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 to describe the heavy quark dynamics and indeed they are necessary to control the structure of the flux tube . had we only one parameter , like the string tension @xmath72 , we could encode the information of a constant energy density in the flux tube .",
    "however , the whole structure is important , and also the information about the width of the flux tube has to be considered . in the limit of very large inter - quark distances and in particular dynamical regimes , we can store the relevant information in one parameter , the string tension .",
    "for instance , from eqs .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) and ( [ due ] ) , the confining part of the static potential is @xcite @xmath73 and the string tension @xmath72 emerges as an integral on the @xmath62 function @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "we study the heavy - light bound state system in the non - recoil limit .",
