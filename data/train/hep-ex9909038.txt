    "these transitions are thought to occur in a two step process by the emission of two gluons followed by hadronization to pion pairs , as indicated in fig .",

    "because of the small mass difference involved , the gluons are soft and can not be handled by perturbative qcd .",
    "however , gottfried @xcite suggested that the gluon emission can be described by a multipole expansion with the gluon fields being expanded in a multipole series similar to electromagnetic transitions . including the leading chromo - electric @xmath17@xmath17 transition , t. m. yan @xcite determined that one of the terms that brown and cahn took to be zero should have a small but nonzero value .",
    "voloshin and zakharov @xcite and later , in a revised analysis , novikov and shifman @xcite worked out the second step , the pion hadronization matrix element using current algebra , pcac , and gauge invariance .",
