    "the study of the category of admissible @xmath7-modules is a main objective of the theory of generalized harish - chandra modules , see  @xcite .    in the case of a general reductive in @xmath0 subalgebra @xmath1 , a central result of the existing theory of generalized harish - chandra modules",
    "is the classification of simple admissible @xmath6-modules with generic minimal @xmath1-type  @xcite .",
    "other notable results for a general @xmath1 are established in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "there are three special cases for @xmath1 in which more detailed information on admissible @xmath6-modules is available .",
    "first of all , this is the case when @xmath1 is a symmetric subalgebra of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath1 coincides with the fixed points of an involution on @xmath0 .",
    "this case , the theory of harish - chandra modules , is in the origin of the studies of generalized harish - chandra modules .",
    "there is an extensive literature on harish - chandra modules , see for instance  @xcite ,  @xcite , and references therein .",
    "( in particular , some remarks on the history of harish - chandra modules can be found in  @xcite . )",
    "another case which has drawn considerable attention is the case when @xmath8 , see for instance  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and references therein . in both these cases",
    ", a classification of simple admissible @xmath6-modules is available and there has been progress in the study of the category of admissible @xmath6-modules .    a third natural choice for @xmath1 is to let @xmath1 be isomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "this case `` interpolates '' between the above two cases and is a natural experimentation ground when aiming at the case of a general @xmath1 . for @xmath9 ,",
    "there is no classification of simple admissible @xmath6-modules for a general @xmath0 and an arbitrary @xmath2-subalgebra @xmath10 ; however , for @xmath11 the partial classification of  @xcite can be carried out under much less severe restrictions on the minimal @xmath1-type : the details are explained in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath1-types are parametrized here simply by nonnegative integers , one can talk about a truncated category of admissible @xmath6-modules : it consists of finite - length admissible modules whose minimal @xmath1-type is larger or equal a bound @xmath12 depending on the pair @xmath6 .",
    "the simple objects of this truncated category have been classified in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe the above truncated category of admissible @xmath6-modules for @xmath13 by proving that it is equivalent to an explicit full subcategory of a thick parabolic category @xmath3 for @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the objects of the truncated category of @xmath6-modules are constructed by simply applying the zuckerman ( first derived ) functor @xmath14 to a subcategory of a thick parabolic category @xmath3 .",
    "it was conjectured in  @xcite that the functor @xmath14 yields an equivalence of these categories , and here we prove this conjecture .",
    "we construct a left adjoint to @xmath14 defined on all finitely generated admissible @xmath6-modules , and then show that , when restricted to the truncated category of admissible @xmath7-modules , this functor is an inverse to the appropriately restricted functor @xmath14 .",
    "the history of @xmath15-modules goes back to the 1940 s : a classical example here is the lorentz pair @xmath16 studied by harish - chandra  @xcite , gelfand - minlos - shapiro  @xcite , and others . explaining how exactly the theorem proved in this paper fits in the 70-year history of the topic is a task so complex that we do not really attempt to tackle it",
    "nonetheless , we would like to mention that in this subject many equivalences of categories have been established ; some relate algebraic categories of @xmath0-modules to geometric categories of sheaves , others relate algebraic categories of @xmath0-modules to other algebraic categories of @xmath0-modules .",
    "the equivalence we establish is clearly of the second kind and could be seen as an analogue of bernstein - gelfand s equivalence of a certain subcategory of harish - chandra bimodules ( or @xmath17-modules ) with category @xmath3 .",
    "an extension of the geometric techniques introduced by beilinson and bernstein from the theory of harish - chandra modules to generalized harish - chandra modules is not straightforward ( see some results in this direction in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite ) , and fitting the main result of the present paper into a geometric contex is an open problem .",
    "we show , however , that the algebraic methods from the 1970 s ( where , in addition to the third author s contribution , we would like to mention to important contributions by enright - varadarajan and enright ) , together with the more recent ideas of  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite ( which are building up on vogan s work ) , are well suited to yield concrete results about the structure of categories of generalized harish - chandra modules .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we state the main result in section [ sec : main ] . in particular , we introduce the functor @xmath18 which will then be shown to be inverse to the functor @xmath14 . in section",
    "[ sec : prelim ] we present some results which deal mostly with the structure of a semi - thick parabolic category @xmath19 we work with .",
    "section [ sec : conjugacy ] contains the proof of the adjointness of @xmath14 and @xmath18 .",
    "the proof of the fact that @xmath14 and @xmath18 are mutually inverse equivalences of categories is carried out in steps throughout sections [ sec : bijection],[sec : exactness ] and [ sec : endofproof ] . in section [ sec : ex ] we show that for some blocks of the semi - thick parabolic category @xmath19 , the truncation condition is vacuous , which then helps establish a stronger equivalence of categories for certain central characters .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : appl ] we provide an application of our equivalence of categories by proving an estimate for the global dimension of the truncated category of admissible @xmath7-modules via a correponding estimate for the truncated semi - thick parabolic category @xmath19",
