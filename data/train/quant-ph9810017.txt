    "during the helsinki meeting on quantum computation and communication ( september 26 - 28 , 1998 ) , some participants explicitly asserted that full fledged quantum computation is completely out of the current course of research ( in my understanding : n. gisin , s. harroche , r. landauer , a. zeilinger ) .",
    "going beyond 10 qubits ( even in the most optimistic estimates ) and a very limited number of computation steps would be out of reach for today s technology and paradigm . therefore , new ideas and , in particular , new computation paradigms would be needed ( a. ekert , the author ) .    the following is an extended version of part of my speech .",
    "it concerns an alternative quantum computation paradigm , completely speculative for the time being .",
    "this paradigm appears in former works of the author and others@xmath0 } $ ] , where it is somewhat buried inside implementation attempts . here",
    "i will explain its bare principle , by resorting to the speculative notion of _ continuous _ uncomplete von neumann measurement .",
    "until now , the topical quantum computer is a transposition of the classical turing machine into the quantum framework . on one side of the coin , there are the well - known revolutionary results , on the other side",
    ", severe limitations are being encountered .",
    "one could think that the very importance of the results obtained might trap research inside a limited horizon .    in the first place",
    ", we should clearly acknowledge the boundaries implicit in the notion of turing machine computation .    before going to this , it is useful to introduce a special perspective",
    ". all efficient quantum algorithms found so far ( more efficient than their classical counterparts as far as we know ) do nothing but solving systems of simultaneous boolean equations .",
    "in fact all np and np - complete problems can be solved by a turing machine in a number of elementary computation steps which has an upper bound .",
    "because of this feature , they can be represented by a system of simultaneous boolean equations , whose size is polynomial in problem size in the case of np and np - complete problems .",
    "it is convenient to have in mind one system of this kind and its network representation ( fig .",
    "1 ) :    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     fig . 2    in fig .",
    "2 , part of the input , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , as the output @xmath3 , are pre - established , the other part of the input , @xmath4 is `` unknown '' .",
    "@xmath5 is a general boolean function .",
    "the problem is whether there is an assignment to the unknown part of the input , such that the output is @xmath6 .",
    "this is the well - known sat problem , which is np - complete .",
    "input and output have a purely logical meaning ; they mean argument and function . as a matter of fact",
    ", they will be _ coexisting _ qubits .",
    "i shall give a preliminary outline of the model first .",
    "this will not be accurate , but gives the line of thinking .",
    "let @xmath7    be the hilbert space the independent qubits ,    @xmath8    be a constrained subspace of @xmath9 , whose basis vectors satisfy the gate logical constraint and the pre - assigned input , and @xmath10 @xmath11 be the projector from @xmath9 on @xmath12 .",
    "we suppress the constraint @xmath13 and give an arbitrary assignment to the unknown part of the input , obtaining ( in polynomial time ) , say , @xmath14 .",
    "obtaining @xmath13 would mean solving the problem by sheer luck , which is disregarded .",
    "we prepare the independent qubits in such an assignment .",
    "then we rotate only qubit @xmath3 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , under continuous uncomplete von neumann @xmath17 measurement of the entire set of qubits .",
    "we will see that , correspondingly , the input changes to a value such that the output is @xmath13 ( provided there is a solution ) .",
    "this is in a way an extrapolation of simon s algorithm `` trick '' [ changing from state ( 1 ) to state ( 2 ) , because of measurement of the @xmath18 register only ] .",
    "in order to show this , it is useful to clarify first the notion of continuous measurement .",
    "this is better done by considering a simple ( reversible ) identity gate .",
    "the two qubits @xmath19 and @xmath3 coexist and are independent . it should be noted that measurement under projector @xmath17 concerns a joint property of the two qubits , whether or not their overall state satisfies the identity gate .",
    "@xmath17 measurement yields an outcome belonging to either    @xmath20",
    "@xmath21    the former subspace satisfies the gate , the latter does not .",
    "we ask the question whether there is a way of applying @xmath17 measurement to obtain that qubit @xmath19 follows a rotation applied only to qubit @xmath3 .",
    "the answer is no if measurement is _ intermittent _ , even in the limit of infinite frequency ( zeno effect ) .",
    "the answer is yes if measurement is _ continuous _ to start with .",
    "we shall consider the former case first .",
    "we should start from a state satisfying the gate , say @xmath22 for simplicity .",
    "time is split into small consecutive intervals @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "3 ) .  during each interval @xmath24 an @xmath25 rotation is applied , with @xmath26 . at the end of the first interval we have the state :    @xmath27    then the two qubits are measured under @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath28 is infinitesimal , with certainty the outcome of measurement is @xmath29 back again .",
    "this holds for any time @xmath30",
    "( for any number of repetitions of the rotation - measurement process ) in the limit @xmath28 @xmath31 .",
    "this is of course the zeno effect , which freezes the evolution in its initial state .",
    "it depends on the fact that , in the quantum framework , there are both probability amplitudes and probabilities , which are the squared modulus of the former ones .",
    "the probability that the outcome of measurement violates the gate is higher order infinitesimal ( @xmath32 ) and can be disregarded .    here , it is important to note that during the entire time interval @xmath28 the gate is violated because of the presence of @xmath33 , with @xmath34 .",
    "the percentage measure of time during which it is violated is 100% : it is not violated in two points in time , it is violated during the entire time interval comprised between the two points .",
    "naturally such a percentage measure remains unaltered in the limit @xmath28 @xmath31 . to sum up , the time measure during which the gate is violated coincides with any elapsed time @xmath30 .",
    "let us now consider _ continuous _ measurement . if measurement is continuous to start with , _ not _ in the limit @xmath28 @xmath35 the gate can never be violated . if we start from an initial state that satisfies the gate , continuous measurement must always keep the state inside @xmath36 .",
    "the evolution under continuous measurement must satisfy the simultaneous conditions@xmath37 } $ ] :    1 .   @xmath38 + @xmath39 2 .",
    "@xmath40 where @xmath17 is the projector from @xmath9 , the hilbert space of the two independent qubits , on @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "( 5 ) , 3 .",
    "the distance between the vectors before and after measurement is minimum , 4 .",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 means partial trace over @xmath43    at any time @xmath30 , @xmath44 is a generic normalized vector of @xmath9 ; if @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are two _ independent _ generic vectors of @xmath9 .",
    "see also ref .",
    "it should be noted that the above conditions yield a very direct mapping of the gate , under any possible transformation of its state .",
    "we can see that sort of identity between definition and construction , discussed in section i. however , we are of course in a speculative situation",
    ".    it can be seen that conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iv ) yield    @xmath48    condition ( iii ) keeps the phase @xmath49 , arbitrarily chosen once for all if the initial state is @xmath50 , frozen throughout the evolution ,  thus for @xmath51 .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( 6 ) that qubit @xmath19 identically follows the rotation of qubit @xmath3 , under this continuous uncomplete measurement .",
    "interestingly , evolution ( 6 )  is _ driven _ by both _  the initial condition _ ( i ) _  and the final condition _ that the result of @xmath17 measurement is a vector belonging to @xmath36 and satisfying conditions ( iii )  and ( iv ) . conditions ( i ) through ( iv ) make up a peculiar variational problem . in a sense , it is simon s `` trick '' brought to the continuum .",
    "if instead we started from the initial state @xmath52    with @xmath49 pre - established as an initial condition , the evolution would have been    @xmath53    evolution ( 8) avoids the difficulty of evolution ( 7 ) , namely the appearance `` out of the blue '' , of the term @xmath54 , with an infinitesimal amplitude and a random phase .",
    "this resembles a state vector reduction reversed in time , and may not be palatable .",
    "evolution ( 8) will serve our needs as well .",
    "now we go back to the general gate of fig .",
    "each unknown input @xmath55 is prepared in the superposition @xmath56 , unlike the `` inaccurate '' outline .",
    "this can be propagated in polynomial time to the ( unconstrained ) output by using a `` conventional '' quantum boolean network , such that it keeps , in its output , the memory of the input .",
    "such coexisting output qubits are of course the logical input and output appearing in fig .",
    "we remain with an independent set of qubits prepared in the state :    @xmath57    with @xmath58 @xmath59 , @xmath60 denote tensor products of all qubit eigenstates but qubit @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath55 ( @xmath61 ) ranges over the set of input arguments whose function is @xmath14 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "if the problem is hard to solve , @xmath62 is exponentially smaller ( in qubits number ) than @xmath63    now we apply the same manipulations already applied to the identity gate : the initial state becomes the right hand of eq .",
    "( 9 ) , @xmath17 becomes the projector from @xmath9 given in ( 3 ) on @xmath36 given in ( 4 ) , pertaining the general boolean gate ..",
    "interestingly , @xmath17 is the product of the projectors from @xmath64 on @xmath65 , the hilbert space spanned by the basis vectors satisfying gate or wire @xmath66 @xmath67 all such projectors are diagonal in the qubit basis , thus pairwise commuting .",
    "we could speak as well of continuous uncomplete measurement under the commuting projectors @xmath68 . ]    with an @xmath25 rotation of qubit @xmath3 ranging from 0 to @xmath69 , state ( 9 ) , submitted to ( updated ) conditions ( i ) trough ( iv ) , changes into    @xmath70    as it can be readily checked . now",
    "the probability of measuring @xmath71 is exponentially small .",
    "a solution is found almost certainly , provided there is one . however ,",
    "if the result of measurement is not a solution , this can be checked in polynomial time . by repeating the overall process for a sufficient number of times , one can ascertain with any desired confidence level whether the network admits a solution .    therefore , it is np - complete = p under this _ continuous _ uncomplete von neumann measurement . whether continuous measurement is physical and ,",
    "possibly , what are the resources required to implement it , remain open problems .",
    "the notion of continuous measurement is physically plausible , in the usual sense that it is in agreement with some physical laws and does not seem to contradict any other laws . therefore it can be argued that we have given a plausible physical scheme under which np - complete = p .",
    "the time required to find a solution ( if any ) is the time required to rotate one independent qubit by @xmath69 .",
    "conventionally , this is just one computation step .",
    "such a scheme might help in thinking out of the box of the conventional turing - quantum paradigm .    in former work@xmath72",
    "} $ ] , it has been conjectured that continuous measurement appears in nature in the form of particle ( fermion , boson , anyon , ... ) statistics .",
    "particle statistics can as well be seen as continuous measurement under the projector on the symmetric hilbert subspace .    from being a passive constant of motion that does nothing to a unitary evolution",
    ", particle statistics should assume an active role , it should `` shape '' the evolution of which it becomes a constant of motion .",
    "one should look for coupling qubits by means of symmetries purely induced by particle statistics .",
    "the exotic kinds like anyon statistics , would provide a broader range of investigation .",
    "for example , we plan to investigate the possibility that the not  and and gate given in ref . [ 2 ] , where qubit coupling is obtained by ( respectively )",
    "fermion and anyon statistics , behave as foreseen in section iv , under rotation of one qubit .",
    "it has been observed that finding a solution by amplifying its amplitude , as we did by transforming state ( 9 ) into state ( 10 ) , resembles grover search algorithm@xmath73 } $ ] , which has been demonstrated to be optimal@xmath74 } $ ] , and gives no exponential speed up .",
    "however , our ( hypothetical ) exponential speed up applies to an np - complete problem , whereas the search problem is p ( polynomial ) .",
    "the system of boolean equations specifying it ] has the same dimension of the classical search process and is already solved .",
    "therefore , the current scheme gives no advantage in a completely explicit search problem .",
