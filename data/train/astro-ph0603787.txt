    "massive binary systems containing a wolf - rayet ( wr ) and o - type star often exhibit synchrotron emission arising from relativistic electrons in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",

    "* ) have revealed that the acceleration site is the region where the massive stellar winds collide - the wind - collision region ( wcr ) .",
    "thus , colliding - wind binary ( cwb ) systems present an important laboratory for investigating the underlying physics of particle acceleration since they provide access to higher mass , radiation and magnetic field energy densities than in supernova remnants ( snrs ) , which have been widely used for such work .",
    "cwb systems are also ideal for understanding related , but more complicated , systems involving colliding winds , such as the cluster of massive stars in the central parsec of the galaxy @xcite , and young , dense stellar clusters ( super star clusters ) , such as the arches @xcite , ngc  3603 @xcite , and r136 @xcite . non - thermal radio emission has recently been detected from the arches cluster @xcite , and the non - thermal radio filaments and `` streaks '' near the galactic center may have their origin in cwbs and cluster winds @xcite .    in this paper",

    "[ sec : gamma ] contains details of our implementation of the various processes responsible for the non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "details of the modelling of the radio emission , including several cooling processes , and various emission and absorption mechanisms , can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "[ sec : wr140 ] , and the implications of our modelling are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : discuss ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize and note future directions .",
    "in this work , it is assumed that the non - thermal particle distribution can be approximated as a power - law @xmath7 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor and @xmath5 is a free - parameter determined from model fits ( primarily ) to the radio emission .",
    "a number of mechanisms can produce such a distribution , as we now discuss along with our assumptions concerning the normalization of the non - thermal particle spectrum and the magnetic field within the wcr .",
    "there are several possible mechanisms for accelerating particles in cwb systems , including dsa , reconnection , and many turbulent processes .",
    "the spectral index of the non - thermal particles can , in each instance , span a wide range of possibilities , as discussed below .",
    "an estimate of which mechanism is likely to be dominant can be made by comparing their relative efficiencies .      in cwb systems",
    ", particles may be accelerated at the contact discontinuity between the two winds as magnetic field lines from the two stars are forced together and reconnect @xcite , and/or within the volume of the wcr as tangled field lines reconnect .",
    "reconnection can occur either as a quasi - steady , or as an explosive , process .",
    "the energy released is transferred into thermal energy through direct joule heating of the plasma , into the kinetic energy of macroscopic motions , and into accelerated particles .",
    "unfortunately , the role of magnetic reconnection in accelerating particles is complex , not least because of the many different types of reconnection , and the intricate magnetic environment that is usually associated with reconnection .",
    "this environment can accelerate particles directly ( through strong electric fields ) , stochastically ( i.e. through the second - order fermi process due to high turbulence ) , and at the mhd shock waves which are an integral part of a reconnecting field ( i.e. through dsa - see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "reconnection is usually thought to produce steep spectra i.e. @xmath4 , such as is seen in solar flares .",
    "a rough upper limit of the power available for particle acceleration due to reconnection can be estimated as follows .",
    "if reconnection occurs as a quasi - steady process , the power released in a current sheet of area @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic reynold s number , @xmath11 is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath12 is the alfvn speed @xcite . if reconnection occurs at the contact discontinuity , the area of the current sheet , @xmath8 , is approximately the area of the apex of the wcr i.e. @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance from the stagnation point of the wcr to the center of the o star , @xmath15 is the separation of the stars , and the wind momentum ratio @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mass - loss rates of the o and wr stars with terminal wind speeds of @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . for our model",
    "b ( see table  [ tab : wr14067_params ] ) , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24  g , so @xmath25 . since @xmath26 is strongly dependent on @xmath11 , the available power from reconnection could be considerably higher than this estimate , and may be further augmented by reconnection occuring throughout the wcr region . while we expect that only a fraction of this total power will end up in non - thermal particles , there is probably sufficient reconnection luminosity to produce the synchrotron emission observed from wr140 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , it may struggle to supply the energy in ic @xmath0-ray emission , which is expected to be @xmath28 greater ( see table  [ tab : nt_lum_models ] )",
    ".      particles may also be accelerated stochastically , by magnetic scattering off turbulent motions @xcite . in this mechanism ,",
    "non - thermal particles either gain or lose energy depending on whether the magnetic field is moving towards or away from the particle .",
    "however , as the scattering probability is proportional to the relative velocity between the particle and the plasma , there is a slight excess of head - on scatterings and a mean increase in momentum .",
    "this process is known as the second - order fermi mechanism , and in principle , hard power - law spectra ( @xmath3 ) may be obtained .",
    "the second - order fermi mechanism is slower and less efficient than dsa ( a first - order fermi process ) in our models of wr140 , since the pre - shock alfvnic mach number , @xmath29 - see table  [ tab : wr14067_params ] .",
    "another possibile mechanism is acceleration in turbulence from resistive magnetohydrodynamical fluctuations @xcite that can produce hard power - law spectra with @xmath3 .",
    "dsa is a variant of the original fermic mechanism , in which particles are accelerated by scattering back and forth across a shock .",
    "the key difference is that fast particles gain energy _",
    "each _ time they are scattered back across the shock , until their eventual loss downstream of the shock .",
    "to a first approximation , dsa produces a power - law energy distribution of non - thermal particles ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of departures from this ) .",
    "the maximum power that is available to dsa is the kinetic luminosity of that part of the stellar winds which are processed through the wcr ( in model  b this is @xmath30 ) .",
    "therefore , dsa easily meets the energy requirements for producing the synchrotron emission seen from wr140 ( @xmath31 ) .    at a single , parallel shock the value of @xmath5",
    "is determined by the compression ratio of the scattering centers across the shock , @xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the strong shock limit , the gas compression ratio @xmath33 ; if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 . however , @xmath5 can be greater or smaller than this value depending on the values of @xmath36 and the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure in the upstream flow , which together determine @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "there are additional ways in which the spectral index can vary from the canonical strong shock limit of @xmath38 .",
    "for instance , when particle acceleration is efficient , the diffusion of non - thermal particles upstream of the subshock exerts a significant back - pressure on the pre - shock flow , causing the gas velocity to decrease prior to the subshock in a smooth precursor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : shock_mod ] ) . as the highest energy particles are able to diffuse further upstream from the subshock , and see the greatest velocity difference between the upstream and downstream flow , a concave curvature to the non - thermal particle energy spectrum",
    "is created .",
    "in addition , the velocity jump across the subshock in this situation is much less than in the classical shock , which results in a reduced post - shock thermal temperature .",
    "convincing evidence for such `` shock modification '' is provided by analysis of observations of several young snrs , including tycho @xcite and sn  1006 @xcite , and from direct spacecraft measurements of the earth s bowshock and interplanetary shocks ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "non - thermal ions are believed to be primarily responsible for modifying shocks because they are thought to dominate the non - thermal energy density ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : norm ] ) .",
    "since the diffusion length of electrons is much smaller than ions for a given lorentz factor , non - thermal electrons are confined to a region much closer to the subshock .",
    "thus , only those electrons with momenta @xmath39 ( i.e. with lorentz factors @xmath40 ) are able to diffuse far enough upstream to see the velocity difference required to obtain a spectral index @xmath3 ( assuming @xmath38 for the unmodified shock - see fig .  1 in * ? ?",
    "* ) . in cwb systems ,",
    "the synchrotron emission at ghz frequencies is from electrons with relatively low momentum .",
    "for example , at the apex of the wcr in model  b of this work , electrons with @xmath41 ( i.e. momentum @xmath42 ) produce synchrotron emission which peaks at @xmath43  ghz , where @xmath44 is the frequency where the synchrotron spectrum cuts off @xcite .",
    "hence , if shock modification occurs in these systems , the synchrotron emission should be characterized by @xmath4 , though if re - acceleration occurs this is not necessarily the case .",
    "the spectral index of non - thermal particles can be modified if they pass through a sequence of shocks . in the limit of many shocks , the spectral index approaches @xmath45 , independent of the shock strength .",
    "this process is known as `` re - acceleration '' ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and if the particles suffer energy losses between the accelerating shocks , @xmath5 can become even smaller @xcite .",
    "shock modification and particle re - acceleration are not necessarily mutually exclusive .",
    "some previous works @xcite have also claimed that @xmath3 can be obtained if the shock is oblique ( i.e. when the b - field is at some angle to the shock normal ) , but these rely on a non - standard shock acceleration model , such as non - isotropic scattering , and we do not consider this further . mechanisms which increase the effective mach number of the shock may also yield @xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , while @xmath4 may be obtained if sub - diffusive cross - field transport is important @xcite .      from energy considerations ,",
    "dsa and reconnection appear to be the most efficient mechanisms , with dsa likely having the edge ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , for the remainder of this work we assume that the non - thermal particles ( electrons and ions ) are created by dsa at the global shocks bounding the wcr and have power - law energy distributions .",
    "we further assume that the downstream magnetic field is highly tangled .",
    "while we do not model the actual acceleration process itself , this is consistent with the bohm limit where the magnetic fluctuations are of the same strength as the background field i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "the strong cross - field diffusion which results in this limit allows efficient injection at quasi - perpendicular shocks .",
    "the diffusion length scale of accelerating particles is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the shock speed , @xmath49 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath50 is the mean - free - path , and @xmath51 is the gyroradius of particles with lorentz factor @xmath0 , mass @xmath52 , and charge @xmath53 in a magnetic field @xmath11 .",
    "the acceleration of non - thermal electrons at the shocks is not affected by the flow geometry of the downstream plasma , as the diffusion lengthscale is only a small fraction of the width of the wcr ( e.g. , @xmath54 for electrons with @xmath55 at the shock apex of model  b , whereas the distance between the global shocks and the contact discontinuity is @xmath56 ) .",
    "therefore , the geometry of the post - shock flow will have no impact on our calculation of the synchrotron and ic emission , or our finding that the electron spectrum has @xmath57 .",
    "the flow geometry may become important for non - thermal ions , but for protons and he nuclei this is only likely to be the case for @xmath58 .",
    "detailed work outside the scope of this paper is required to examine the effect of the flow geometry on our predictions of the high energy emission from the decay of neutral pions .",
    "we do not consider the inverse - compton ( ic ) cascade of secondary electrons and positrons that occur when the optical depth of @xmath0-rays to pair - production in a stellar radiation field is high and when ic scattering is efficient , though in wr140 the secondary @xmath0-rays produced in the cascade and which subsequently escape the system may be comparable to the observed flux of primary @xmath0-rays above gev energies for the orbital phase considered in this work ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "the non - thermal electrons formed by hadronic collisions , and the knock - on electrons formed when non - thermal nuclei collide with thermal ( atomic and free ) electrons , are also ignored in this work , though the emission resulting from these processes is not expected to be dominant ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also ignore an additional ( though likely small ) contribution to the non - thermal radio emission from particles accelerated at wind - embedded shocks caused by the line - deshadowing instability in radiatively driven winds , since in wr140 the non - thermal emission is clearly related to binarity .",
    "we set @xmath5 as a free parameter for the particle distribution immediately downstream of the shocks , with the assumption that it is spatially invariant along the face of the shocks , and identical for electrons and ions .",
    "for the ions @xmath5 does not change in the post - shock flow , but as the non - thermal electrons advect downstream ic cooling modifies their energy distribution , and in this case @xmath5 is dependent on both their spatial position and @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "for instance , in model  b , electrons accelerated at the wr shock on the line of centers between the stars cool to @xmath59 within a time of @xmath60 , during which they are advected a distance of @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) downstream ( assuming that the speed of the post - shock flow is @xmath63 in this region of the wcr ) .",
    "electrons accelerated at a point on the wr and o shocks which is a distance @xmath15 from the o star cool to @xmath64 within a time of @xmath65 . during this time",
    "they are advected a distance of @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) downstream ( assuming a post - shock flow speed close to the terminal wind speeds ) .        since the population of non - thermal particles",
    "is not determined from first principles in our models , the non - thermal electron energy density , @xmath68 , is assumed to be proportional to the thermal particle internal energy density , @xmath69 i.e. @xmath70 . also , it is assumed that shock obliquity does not influence the normalization of the non - thermal electron energy density .",
    "however , we note that in general , the higher the obliquity , the lower the injection efficiency ( although particles are actually accelerated more rapidly as a result of shock drift along the surface and slower diffusion in the shock normal direction - see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in wide binaries , such as wr140 , the shocks near the head of the wcr should , in principle , be highly oblique .",
    "yet this picture is further complicated if the level of magnetic turbulence is at the bohm limit , since then the shock does not have a well - defined obliquity , and strong cross - field diffusion results in efficient injection ( see fig .  6 in",
    "such concerns are beyond the scope of the present work .    to obtain an estimate of the @xmath0-ray flux from the decay of neutral pions , the energy density of relativistic ions must be specified .",
    "similar to the non - thermal electrons , it is assumed that @xmath71 .",
    "fits to the radio data are only sensitive to @xmath72 and constraining @xmath73 requires unambiguous detection of the emission from neutral pion - decay , which has not been attained for cwb systems .",
    "moreover , the relative injection efficiency of electrons and ions is not known , while the value of @xmath74 also depends on the spectral index @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "having said this , it is reasonably certain that dsa transfers considerably less energy into non - thermal electrons than into non - thermal ions ( , * ? ? ? * ) , while the relative difficulty of accelerating electrons is also consistent with the well established value for the ratio of proton to electron energy densities for galactic cosmic rays of @xmath75 @xcite . in this work",
    "we somewhat arbitrarily assume that @xmath76 , unless otherwise noted , though the actual ratio in wr140 could differ significantly .",
    "as a result , our predictions of the @xmath0-ray flux from neutral pion decay and neutrino flux from charged pion decay are highly uncertain . however , hard upper limits for these fluxes can be obtained due to the requirement that the total power put into non - thermal particles must be less than the available kinetic power in the wcr i.e. @xmath77 .    as non - thermal particles flow downstream , they are subject to adiabatic losses .",
    "this is achieved in an approximate fashion in this work through the assumption that @xmath68 and @xmath78 are proportional to @xmath69 . in reality",
    "the adiabatic indices for thermal and relativistic plasma differ , and adiabatic expansion also reduces the lorentz factor of the particles . while neither of these effects is treated properly in our model , the specific parameterization we have chosen will not lead to significant errors in the resulting non - thermal radio emission .",
    "this is because ic cooling is so rapid for high energy electrons that synchrotron emission above @xmath79  ghz is largely confined to a thin region near the shocks , where the effects of adiabatic expansion of the flow are minimal .",
    "likewise , the radiation from pion decay is concentrated near the apex of the wcr .",
    "if the field is frozen into the post - shock plasma of density @xmath80 , one would anticipate @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , but amplification of the magnetic field by the accelerated particles ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and/or reconnection complicates this simple scaling .",
    "this also implies that it is not necessarily straightforward to determine the b - field in the wcr from assumptions about the strength of the surface magnetic field at each star .",
    "indirect evidence for amplification has recently been obtained in several snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . instead , for convenience",
    ", we have assumed that the magnetic energy density is proportional to the thermal particle energy density i.e. @xmath83 .",
    "this choice is equivalent to some amplification in the downstream flow , but we have verified that there is little difference in the shape of the synchrotron spectrum between these two methods . compared to other work where the b - field is assumed to be spatially invariant , this approximation at least has the benefit that the b - field declines away from the symmetry axis . undoubtedly , a better description for the b - field will be obtained in future mhd models of the wcr .",
    "our final assumption is that the post - shock b - field is highly tangled so that the synchrotron emission is isotropic .",
    "when modelling the radio emission from specific systems , @xmath85 and @xmath72 are chosen to best match the observed radio emission . as @xmath84 decreases , the value of @xmath86 has to increase to reproduce an observed radio flux .",
    "a lower limit on @xmath84 can be obtained from the fact that the razin turnover frequency , @xmath87 , increases with declining @xmath84 ( @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the electron number density and the magnetic field , @xmath90 ) , or because the value of @xmath86 required to match an observed flux exceeds the available power for particle acceleration in the wcr . an upper limit on @xmath84",
    "is obtained from the necessary conditions for particle acceleration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since there is currently little guidance for the ratio of @xmath91 in cwb systems , we consider this to be a free parameter in our models , subject to the above constraints .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath0 for electrons is obtained by balancing the rate of energy increase from dsa to the rate of energy loss by ic cooling ( e.g. , see eqs .  4 and 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "this is spatially dependent due to the geometric dilution of both the stellar radiation and magnetic fields , and also dependent on orbital phase for binaries with eccentric orbits like wr140 .",
    "an evaluation of these equations at the points where the shocks intersect the line of centers through the stars reveals that @xmath92 at orbital phase 0.837 for sensible values of @xmath11 .",
    "most of the wind power passing into the wcr occurs within an off - axis distance of @xmath93 from the line of centers @xcite , and one expects that most of the energy transfer into non - thermal particles must occur within this volume too .",
    "the value of @xmath94 evaluated at a position on the shock front at the extremity of this region is only 25 per cent higher than on the line of centers if the magnetic field strength is assumed to decline as @xmath95 and if there is no dependence on the shock obliquity ( as already mentioned , this is not well defined if the level of magnetic turbulence is at the bohm limit ) .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , throughout this work it is assumed that @xmath96 along the entire shock fronts .    while the above evaluation was for the thomson limit , at such energies ic losses",
    "occur in the klein - nishina regime , and the spectral distribution as well as the cut - off energy will change . however , in the calculations in this paper , ic cooling is so rapid near the apex of the wcr that the downstream population of non - thermal electrons in this region is essentially independent of whether thomson or klein - nishina cross - sections are used .",
    "thus , the ic emission and our predictions for the @xmath0-ray fluxes are essentially identical too , with the exception that the high energy cutoff is sensitive ( by a factor of order 2 ) to such details .",
    "the maximum non - thermal ion energy is set by balancing the timescale of their acceleration to their advection timescale out of the system .",
    "following @xcite as shown here in eq .",
    "[ eq : gam_max_ions ] . ] , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the charge and mass of the ion , and @xmath11 and @xmath100 are the pre - shock magnetic field and wind speed . for wide binaries where the pre - shock magnetic field declines as @xmath95 , @xmath101 is expected to be independent of @xmath15 .    for the models considered in this paper , @xmath102 , so for convenience , we set @xmath103 for both the electron and ion distributions in the remainder of this work .",
    "the predicted @xmath0-ray flux is , of course , sensitive to the value of @xmath94 chosen for both the electrons and ions . in addition , @xmath104 is assumed .      in the simplest test - particle calculations of dsa",
    "i.e. with no feedback , all particles accelerated in a given shock will have identical power - law spectral shapes in momentum , regardless of their charge , and the non - thermal particle composition reflects the composition of thermal particles .",
    "however , in non - linear models , the spectral shape and injection and acceleration efficiencies are dependent on the ionic species",
    ". ions with large mass - to - charge ( a / q ) ratios diffuse further upstream than protons of the same energy per nucleon ( provided that both are non - relativistic ) , and are accelerated more efficiently and obtain a flatter spectrum because they `` see '' a larger velocity difference and are more easily injected to suprathermal energies . among the volatile elements , observational support comes from galactic cosmic rays , which show an enhancement of heavier elements relative to lighter ones @xcite .",
    "a general enhancement of the refractory elements relative to the volatile ones is also apparent from the galactic cosmic ray composition @xcite .",
    "this has been explained by acceleration of dust grains ( which can have huge mass - to - charge ratios of @xmath105 ) , followed by the sputtering of atoms from these grains .",
    "however , the harsh uv radiation fields in cwb systems makes it unlikely that dust grains can form near the head of the wcr , so an enhancement of refactory elements is not expected .",
    "several cwb systems , including wr140 , show observational signatures of either episodic or continuous dust formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though in all cases the dust is thought to form well downstream of the apex of the wcr .",
    "observations have further revealed that the relative abundance of heavy ions increases with energy .",
    "this is supported by the results from non - linear models where variation with shock speed and mach number is also seen @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that shock obliquity may influence the non - thermal particle composition .",
    "high energy heavy nuclei may also lose nucleons due to collisions with stellar photons i.e. by photo - disintegration .",
    "this occurs if the photon energy in the reference frame of the nuclei , @xmath106 , exceeds @xmath107  mev @xcite . here",
    "@xmath108 is the temperature of the radiation field . in wr140",
    ", this process applies to nuclei with @xmath109 , and is only likely to affect a small part of the top end of the non - thermal particle distribution .",
    "in addition , an estimate of the ratio of the characteristic photo - disintegration timescale to the acceleration and advection timescales reveals that photo - disintegration is not efficient for particles with @xmath110 in wr140 at the orbital phase considered in this work .",
    "the fragmentation of high energy nuclei through collisions with thermal ions is likewise negligible .    given the uncertainties discussed earlier , we adopt the following simplifications : i ) identical spectra for all non - thermal particles , ii ) identical composition to that of the thermal particles , iii ) no dependence on the shock obliquity .",
    "the presence of non - thermal electrons and ions should give rise to x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from several separate mechanisms , including ic scattering , relativistic bremsstrahlung , and pion decay ( the non - thermal electrons are not energetic enough to produce synchrotron x - ray emission ) . while definitive evidence for non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from cwbs does not yet exist , many of the yet unidentified egret sources appear correlated with populations of massive stars @xcite , and",
    "some systems appear to show a power - law tail extending to higher energies than the thermal x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "a critical question is whether the non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray fluxes from cwb systems are sufficiently high to be detected with instruments onboard current observatories , and instruments on observatories that will be operational in the near future .",
    "previous predictions of the ic emission have usually been based on the fact that the ratio of the luminosity from ic scattering to the synchrotron luminosity is equal to the ratio of the photon energy density , @xmath111 , to the magnetic field energy density , @xmath112 : @xmath113 typically , the ratio of @xmath114 is evaluated only at the stagnation point , whereas in reality the emission is generated throughout the wcr , with @xmath114 varying spatially .",
    "in addition , @xmath115 is usually set to the _ observed _ synchrotron luminosity , whereas free - free absorption by the extended wind envelopes can be significant ( see , , * ? ? ? * ) . in such cases",
    "the intrinsic synchroton luminosity , and consequently the non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray luminosity , will be underestimated if radio data , particularly at lower frequencies , are used without regard to free - free absorption ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig : var_theta ] , [ fig : ffabs_components ] and [ fig : razin_components ] ) . furthermore , the predictive power of eq .",
    "[ eq : icsynclum ] is greatly undermined by the fact that the magnetic field strength in the wcr is generally not known with any certainty . since @xmath116",
    ", small changes in the estimated value of the magnetic field stength , @xmath11 , can lead to large changes in @xmath117 ( see fig .  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to obtain a more robust estimate of the ic emission from cwb systems ,",
    "the population and spatial distribution of non - thermal electrons must be determined directly .",
    "this information can , in principle , be acquired from model fits to radio data , since the ic emission arises from the same non - thermal electrons responsible for the synchrotron radio emission . as already noted , an improved theoretical basis for the modelling of the radio emission from such systems",
    "was developed by @xcite and @xcite , and we use this as the foundation for our calculations of the non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "key benefits over previous work include a more realistic description of the geometry of the wcr , the evolution of the energy distribution of the non - thermal electrons as they advect downstream from their acceleration site , and absorption of high energy photons by pair production in the stellar radiation fields .",
    "our predictions for the expected @xmath0-ray emission are based on model fits to the available radio and x - ray data , which allow us to constrain the range of free parameters and build in a degree of consistency for our estimates .",
    "ic cooling is a major energy loss mechanism for non - thermal electrons in cwb systems , and the non - thermal x - ray and @xmath0-ray luminosity should exceed the synchrotron radio luminosity by several orders of magnitude . in the thomson regime , the average energy of a photon after",
    "isotropic ic scattering is @xcite @xmath118 since the average photon energy of an early - type star , @xmath119ev , lorentz factors of order @xmath120 are sufficient to produce ic x - ray and @xmath0-ray radiation up to gev energies .",
    "the resulting emission has a spectral shape which is identical to the intrinsic synchrotron emission at radio frequencies . for our calculations",
    ", we assume that the scattering is isotropic and takes place in the thomson limit . while a more thorough treatment would take account of klein - nishina effects , which are important at high energies , recent work has shown that the resulting change to the non - thermal electron energy distribution is rather small when the stellar separation is @xmath121 @xcite .",

    "* ) , though the most extreme modification ( e.g. , compression ratios much greater than 4 ) will occur only at the cluster s edge .",
    "shock modification is also a potential explanation for the lower than expected temperature of the x - ray emitting gas observed in several dense stellar clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though mass - loading and slow equilibration of the post - shock ion and electron temperatures are other possibilities .",
    "in addition , the x - ray luminosities of the diffuse gas are generally higher than expected , which indicates mass - loading and/or a low thermalization efficiency @xcite , the latter also being consistent with efficient particle acceleration and shock modification .",
    "if the rate at which energy is removed from the cluster ( for example , by radiative cooling ) exceeds 30% of the energy injection rate , a time independent cluster wind can not form @xcite . though the removal of energy through particle acceleration was not considered , efficiencies of this order are expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which case a full time - dependent solution for the cluster wind is required . amongst the dense stellar clusters known in our galaxy ,",
    "the central cluster around sgr  a * is unusual in many respects , including the recent detection of apparently thermal gas with a temperature @xmath239  kev @xcite , and tev emission .",
    "observations with hess show a 1 - 10 tev luminosity of @xmath240 @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the tev source size is @xmath241 ( 95% confidence level ) , which corresponds to @xmath242  pc at the distance of the galactic center .",
    "the photon spectrum above the 165  gev threshold is specified by @xmath243 , with @xmath244 and @xmath245 , and has been independently confirmed with magic @xcite .",
    "various origins of the tev emission have been proposed , including the central supermassive black hole @xcite , the young snr sgr  a east @xcite , the dark matter halo @xcite , and from non - thermal particles accelerated at the multiple colliding winds shocks @xcite , which we now discuss .",
    "the total wind power estimated from the cluster of stars within @xmath246 ( @xmath247  pc ) of the galactic center is @xmath248 . in the context of colliding winds ,",
    "the tev emission may arise from ic upscattering of ambient photons by non - thermal electrons , or from the decay of neutral pions created by the collisions of non - thermal and thermal hadrons .",
    "we now consider each process in turn .",
    "it is likely that ic cooling limits the maximum lorentz factor that non - thermal electrons within the central parsec can attain to @xmath249 @xcite , which is only marginally high enough for ic scattering to account for the detected tev flux .",
    "the tev emission occurs from electrons whose cooling time is less than the flow time out of the cluster i.e. from those with @xmath250 . for a power - law distribution of electrons @xmath251 ,",
    "the ic photon spectral index is @xmath252 , for @xmath250 .",
    "hence the tev spectral index of 2.2 implies that @xmath253 .",
    "if instead neutral pions are responsible , the observed spectral index indicates that @xmath254 . in the context of multiple colliding winds ,",
    "@xcite estimates the emission from pion - decay to be @xmath255 , assuming 10% acceleration efficiency for hadrons at the multiple shocks , and a 10% energy transfer into pions i.e. a 1% efficiency overall . other estimates in the literature suggest a somewhat lower luminosity from this process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this process nevertheless appears to be plausible on energy grounds .",
    "the required value of @xmath5 for each of these processes is much softer than we find here for wr140 , and also for the theoretical limit for multiple shocks ( p=1.0 , * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that re - acceleration at multiple shocks within the cluster , as proposed by @xcite , does not occur .",
    "it is possible to imagine several reasons why this might be the case .",
    "firstly , there is unlikely to be a seed population of non - thermal particles from wind - embedded shocks encountering the termination shock of the winds because of the large adiabatic cooling experienced as the plasma flows out to @xmath256  pc .",
    "hence , the particle spectrum immediately downstream of the termination shocks is likely to correspond to the single - shock limit .",
    "secondly , it is not entirely clear that there will be numerous opportunities for particle re - acceleration within the radius of the cluster , since the cooling timescale of the shocked gas is long , and it remains hot , and therefore subsonic .",
    "analytical solutions of cluster winds reveal that the shocked gas , on average , only becomes supersonic at the outer radius of the cluster @xcite . within the cluster interior ,",
    "the network of hot post - shock gas experiences pressure gradients and weak shocks as it escapes , but in general is not likely to be repeatedly shocked .",
    "this lack of opportunity for re - acceleration means that @xmath5 is likely to remain close to the value obtained from a single shock .",
    "perhaps the most natural explanation is that the majority of particle acceleration occurs at low mach number shocks ( @xmath257 and @xmath258 , for ic or pion - decay emission respectively ) within the network of hot shocked gas .",
    "this conclusion does not rule out the possibility of modification at the termination shocks of the individual winds , which would be consistent with the low x - ray temperature of the cooler emission component ( @xmath259  kev , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but does exclude shock modification as the only process since a hard particle spectrum ( @xmath3 ) is expected at the high particle energies ( @xmath260 ) which are necessary .",
    "an alternative explanation is sub - diffusive cross - field transport ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : dsa ] ) .",
    "the galactic center region has also been detected at gev energies .",
    "the observed luminosity of the egret source 3eg  j1745 - 2852 is @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "however , while its position is consistent with sgr  a * , the angular resolution of @xmath262 covers a solid angle about 100 times larger than the emission seen with hess .",
    "as the egret spectrum is about 4 orders of magnitude brighter than the observed hess emission extrapolated as a power - law to gev energies , different processes / sources may well be responsible for the detected emission ( although different assumptions concerning the injection spectrum and diffusion coefficients of non - thermal protons may account for both observations , as shown by * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of the origin of non - thermal protons , if the emission is from pion - decay , a substantial tev neutrino flux should be seen by neutrino telescopes .",
    "while it remains difficult to draw firm conclusions on the nature of the tev emission observed from the galactic center , we note that the nearby arches cluster , which has an integrated mass - loss rate from its stellar components within an order of magnitude of the galactic center cluster , has not yet been detected at tev energies .",
    "this may argue against the cluster wind scenario as an explanation for the tev emission from the galactic center .",
    "in this paper we have applied models to the observed emission from wr140 at @xmath123 , when the radio emission is near maximum , and when x - ray data are available .",
    "predictions for the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from ic scattering , relativistic bremsstrahlung , and neutral pion decay , as well as for the muon neutrino flux , are made .",
    "our calculations are based on the orbital solution of @xcite , and contain a number of simplifying assumptions , including i ) that the non - thermal electrons and ions are accelerated at the shocks bounding the wcr ( this is assumed to be through dsa , but need not necessarily be so ) and have power - law spectra with a sharp cutoff at @xmath263 before advecting downstream , ii ) the non - thermal particle distribution at these shocks is normalized with respect to the local post - shock thermal energy density , the non - thermal ions have @xmath264 the energy density of the non - thermal electrons , and neither the spectral index of the energy distribution nor @xmath94 vary along the shocks , iii ) the energy density of the magnetic field is similarly normalized to the local post - shock thermal energy density , iv ) particle acceleration has no effect on the thermal shock structure i.e. there is no shock `` modification '' , v ) ic cooling occurs in the thomson limit with isotropic scattering , vi ) the emission from secondary particles is ignored .",
    "rapid ic cooling of the high energy electrons in the post - shock flow means that the local value of @xmath94 is typically @xmath265 .",
    "the assumptions @xmath263 and @xmath266 , together with the assumptions in v ) , mean that the predicted emission at gev energies and above is relatively uncertain at this stage .",
    "our predictions for the veritas-4 flux , in particular , should be treated as an estimate .    despite the large number of assumptions listed above , it is possible to make a number of key deductions concerning the nature of wr140 and the particle acceleration process at the wcr .",
    "we clearly show that vlba imaging observations of wr140 do not currently have enough sensitivity to constrain the wind momentum ratio @xmath206 , through determination of the shock opening angle .",
    "vlbi observations are only sensitive to high - brightness emission that arises in the region of the apex of the wcr , where the wcr has yet to attain an asympototic opening angle .",
    "furthermore , we find that the relative positions of the stars and the peak of the observed emission from the wcr is not necessarily related to @xmath206 , due to occultation by the stellar winds .",
    "such observations have been used to determine @xmath206 in a number of wider cwb systems where occulatation effects are expected to be relatively unimportant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we caution against the application of this method to closer systems like wr140 . in spite of these limitations in interpreting vlba observations , it is possible to constrain the wind momentum ratio using simultaneous fits to the radio and x - ray data to @xmath267 .",
    "a remaining concern is that the line - of - sight angle into the system in our preferred model is some way from the observationally determined value , although the uncertainty in the latter is not negligible .",
    "additional data is required to further constrain the orbital parameters of wr140 .",
    "the stellar mass - loss rates in our preferred model are @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",
    "while the o star mass - loss rate is substantially lower than the values estimated by @xcite for o4 - 5 supergiants , an order of magnitude reduction in the mass - loss rate is consistent with the recent estimates of @xcite , and with some current explanations of the observed near - symmetry of x - ray lines .",
    "such sizeable reductions have extensive implications for massive star evolution ( including gamma - ray bursts ) , and feedback on the interstellar medium .",
    "there is also some scope for reducing the stellar luminosities adopted from @xcite .",
    "an important finding is that models of the radio data require @xmath3 .",
    "several possible mechanisms can in principle explain this . in any case , a flatter spectrum for the non - thermal particles has important implications for the modelling of the high energy non - thermal emission from such systems , with almost all previous models in the literature assuming that @xmath38 .",
    "while our fits are currently non - unique , models where the razin effect is responsible for the low frequency radio turnover ( which allow @xmath38 ) can be ruled out on the basis that the implied efficiency of electron acceleration is extraordinarily high .",
    "furthermore , they predict the detection of ic emission by integral which has not yet been achieved , and in some cases non - thermal x - ray emission at fluxes higher than the observed thermal emission . observations with suzaku should be more sensitive than those made with integral , and will allow tighter constraints to be placed on the strength of the magnetic field . our inability to obtain fits to the radio data with @xmath4 does not necessarily exclude the possibility of shock modification , but on balance we believe that this is unlikely to occur in wr140 .",
    "however , large non - linear effects , comparable to those possible at the reverse shock in snrs @xcite , may occur at the wind - wind collisions in stellar clusters where the b - field is much lower .",
    "our flux predictions at orbital phase 0.837 are summarized in table  [ tab : nt_lum_models ] .",
    "the photon fluxes in the integral , glast , and veritas-4 band - passes range from @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and @xmath272 , respectively , with our preferred model having fluxes of @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 .",
    "the high energy non - thermal emission from wr140 is expected to display significant variability with orbital phase as the stellar separation and line - of - sight angle change , both of which affect the opacity of absorption in the stellar radiation fields and the emission from the resulting ic cascade of secondary electrons and positrons .",
    "in addition , the spectral index and the acceleration efficiency of the primary non - thermal particles may also change .",
    "we emphasize that the future detection of tev emission from cwb systems will almost certainly indicate pion - decay , since the high photon fluxes prevent the acceleration of electrons beyond @xmath276 .",
    "wr140 , along with wr146 which has the brightest non - thermal radio emission of any cwb @xcite , and wr147 which is the widest cwb system on the sky @xcite and the only system resolved in x - rays @xcite , present a real opportunity for the unambiguous detection of pion - decay from accelerated ions .",
    "the estimated flux of tev photons from cwb systems compares favourably to some other mechanisms , and may contribute part or all of the flux from some tev sources .",
    "the multiple colliding winds in the galactic center cluster may make a non - negligble contribution to the observed tev flux . however , wide cwb systems are not expected to be strong neutrino sources .",
    "tighter constraints on @xmath5 and the nature of the shocks and particle acceleration in colliding winds systems ( binaries and clusters ) are best achieved through the dual strategy of improving the theoretical models and obtaining observational data at mev and gev energies . on the theoretical side",
    ", models should explicitly account for the transfer of part of the available pre - shock energy into accelerated particles , self - consistently calculate the non - thermal electron and ion spectra and their subsequent evolution as they advect with the downstream flow , and include klein - nishina effects and anistropic ic scattering .",
    "upcoming observations by agile and glast at mev and gev energies , where the emission is no longer degenerate with @xmath11 and @xmath5 , should then distinguish between the non - unique model fits to the radio data , and determine the b - field in the wcr and the spectral index of the non - thermal particles .",

    "<S> we use hydrodynamical models of the wind - collision region ( wcr ) in the archetype colliding - wind system wr140 to determine the spatial and spectral distribution of the radio , x - ray and @xmath0-ray emission from shock accelerated electrons . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are for orbital phase 0.837 when the observed radio emission is close to maximum . using the observed thermal x - ray emission at this phase in conjunction with the radio emission to constrain the mass - loss rates , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the o - star mass - loss rate is consistent with the reduced estimates for o4 - 5 supergiants by @xcite , and the wind momentum ratio , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is independent of the opening angle deduced from radio vlbi observations of the wcr that we demonstrate fail to constrain the opening angle .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the turnover at @xmath2  ghz in the radio emission is due to free - free absorption , since models based on the razin effect have an unacceptably large fraction of energy in non - thermal electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we find the spectral index of the non - thermal electron energy distribution is flatter than the canonical value for diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , namely @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> several mechanisms are discussed that could lead to such an index . our inability to obtain fits to the radio data with @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> does not exclude the possibility of shock modification , but stronger evidence than currently exists is necessary for its support .    </S>",
    "<S> tighter constraints on @xmath5 and the nature of the shocks in wr140 will be obtained from future observations at mev and gev energies , for which we generally predict lower fluxes than previous work . </S>",
    "<S> since the high stellar photon fluxes prevent the acceleration of electrons beyond @xmath6 , tev emission from colliding - wind binary ( cwb ) systems will provide unambiguous evidence of pion - decay emission from accelerated ions . </S>",
    "<S> we finish by commenting on the emission and physics of the multiple wind collisions in dense stellar clusters , paying particular attention to the galactic center .    </S>",
