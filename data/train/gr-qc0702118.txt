    "the direct detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) is one of the most exciting scientific goals because it would improve our understanding of laws governing the universe and provide new means to observe it .",
    "the most sensitive detectors which are already operating , under construction or being planned are based on optical interferometers @xcite . in most cases , however , the sensitivities are only marginally sufficient to detect the expected signals , detectors have large sizes ranging from a few km on the earth ( virgo , ligo ) to millions of km in space ( lisa ) and the operating frequency ranges are limited .",
    "therefore it is of great interest to investigate alternative schemes that can lead to a higher sensitivity , smaller sizes and extend the frequency range of the detectors .    in recent years",

    "different schemes can be used for splitting , reflecting and recombining the atoms . in a particular class of interferometers , which is the one relevant in this paper , the separation of the atoms is achieved by inducing a transition between internal states of the atoms by an electromagnetic field .",
    "the spatial separation in this case is induced by the momentum recoil and the internal and external states of the atoms become entangled .",
    "another approach is to use material gratings .",
    "this raises however different problems , both conceptual and technical , such as the realization and handling of the required nano - structures and it will not be considered here .    in this paper , we discuss the possibility to use ai to detect gravitational waves .",
