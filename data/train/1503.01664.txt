    "in the context of hierarchical structure formation ( white & frenk 1991 ; springel et al .",
    "2005b ) galaxies are sculpted by a sequence of mergers and accretion events . in the early evolution of these mergers , the cores of each galaxy will sink to the central region of the new system , until they coalesce forming a new virialized core . during the migration of the cores , the massive black holes ( mbhs ) that are expected to live at the central region of every galaxy ( richstone et al .",
    "1998 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; gultekin et al . 2009 ; kormendy & ho 2013 ) will follow the center of each core .",
    "+ if the galaxies that are involved in this merger are rich in gas , numerical simulations show that 60 to 90 % of this gas can fall to the central kilo parsec of the remnant ( barnes & hernquist 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ; barnes 2002 ; mayer et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ) .",
    "this is consistent with observations of gas - rich interacting galaxies , where it is often found that the amount of gas contained in their central regions is comparable with the total gas content of a large gas - rich galaxy ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ; downes & solomon 1998 ; medling et al . 2014 ; ueda et al . 2014 ) both numerical simulations and observations suggest that this gas often settles in a disk - like distribution , or circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) .",
    "several authors have performed numerical simulations studying the evolution of mbhs after a galaxy merger . in these simulations ,",
    "a pair of mbhs is embedded in a gaseous cnd .",
    "most studies indicate that the pair of mbhs dissipate angular momentum into the ambient gas , which drives the formation of an mbh binary and the subsequent orbital decay of this binary down to separations on the order of @xmath2 pc .",
    "the timescale for this process is on the order of @xmath1 @xmath3 ( escala et al .",
    "2005 ; dotti et al .",
    "2006 ; fiacconi et al .",
    "2013 ) in some cases , the viscous torque of the gas is not strong enough to dissipate the angular momentum extracted from the mbh binary and the gas is forced to move away from the binary ( del valle & escala 2012 , 2014 ) . in these cases ,",
    "the mbh binary is left inside a cavity of low gas density , and dissipation of its angular momentum into its environment is less effective . as a result , the migration timescale of such systems can be longer than the hubble time ( lodato et al .",
    "2009 ; cuadra et al .",
    "2009 ) . in each of these studies",
    ", it is assumed that the gas follows a simple polytropic equation of state and that the cnd evolves without star formation .",
    "more recent simulations of the evolution of mbh pairs in galaxy mergers include the effects of star formation , supernovae , and cooling ( hopkins & quataert 2010 ; callegariet al .",
    "2011 ; van wassenhove et al . 2012 ; roskar et al .",
    "these studies explore how the morphology of the galaxies , their gas fraction , and the geometry of the merger can affect the accretion and orbital evolution of the mbh pair .",
    "however , in these studies , the star formation rates and supernovae feedback are fixed in order to reproduce observed relations , such as the kennicutt - schmidt relation ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "little attention has been given to how different efficiencies or intensities of these processes can affect the orbital evolution of an mbh pair after a galaxy merger .",
    "in this work we investigate the evolution of two mbhs embedded in a cnd and , for the first time , we explore how different star formation rates can result in different migration timescales of the mbh pair . in section ",
    "2 we describe the code used in our simulations , and how we model star formation , cooling , and supernovae heating . in section ",
    "3 we show how the mbhs separation evolves for different star formation rates . in section",
    " 4 we compute the gravitational torque exerted by the gas on the smbhs , and we show that high density gas , in the form of clumps , is the primary source of this torque . in section  5 we compare the mass and density of these gas clumps to observations .",
    "we also discuss some features missing from our simulations that are crucial to properly modeling these clumps and obtaining densities in better agreement with observation . finally , in section  6 we summarize the main results of our work and their implications on the orbital evolution of mbhs after a galaxy merger .",
    "to compute the evolution of the smbhs embedded in the cnd , we use the code ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ; springel 2005 ) .",
    "this code evolves the system by computing gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm , and it represents fluids by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; e.g.monaghan1992 ) .",
    "the sph technique has difficulty resolving some hydrodynamical instabilities , such as kelvin - helmholtz or rayleigh - taylor instability , because it generates spurious forces on particles that are in regions with steep gradients of density ( agertz et al.2007 ; mcknally , lyra & passy 2012 ) .",
    "a proper treatment of these instabilities is important to model processes such as star formation and the turbulence in the ism .",
    "these instabilities are better resolved by codes that use an eulerian grid based technique , such as amr , however , in these codes the orbits of massive particles experiences strong and spurious perturbations , making massive particles to follow unphysical orbits .",
    "for this reason , eulerian grid codes are not suitable to study the orbital evolution of smbhs embedded in a gaseous cnd ( lupi , haardt & dotti 2014 and reference therein ) and we choose to use sph rather than a eulerian grid based code .    to study how the formation of stars in a gaseous circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) can affect the orbital evolution of a pair of smbhs embedded in the cnd , we created recipes for star formation , gas cooling , and heating due to supernovae and implemented these recipes in the code .",
    "our recipes have certain key differences from those included in .",
    "in particular , in our recipes the gas can reach lower temperatures , star formation does not depend exclusively on gas density , and we do not assume the stellar feedback to be instantaneous .",
    "the recipes we implement resemble those of stinson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used in the sph code gasoline ( wadsley et al .",
    "2004 ) , and those of saitoh et al .",

    "k we compute the cooling essentially as described by katz et al .",

    "the gas particles selected in this way are treat as candidates for star formation .    for each gas particle that satisfies these criteria ,",
    "we compute the probability @xmath14 of giving birth to a star of mass @xmath15 ( this mass is fixed throughout the simulation ) as    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the mass of the gas particle , @xmath18 is the constant that controls the star formation efficiency , and @xmath19 is the star formation timescale , computed as the maximum of the cooling time @xmath20 and the dynamical time @xmath21 .",
    "finally , for each star - formation - eligible gas particle , we draw a random number @xmath22 between zero and one . if @xmath23 a new star particle of mass @xmath15 is spawned and the new mass of the parent gas particle is computed as : @xmath24 .",

    "( 1996 ) for stellar lifetimes , we compute the number of type ii supernovae ( snii ) events that occur in each ssp as a function of time .",
    "then we assume that for each of these snii events the star particle deposits @xmath25 ergs of energy into the closest 32 gas particles .",
    "we do not include any heating by supernovae type ia , because the typical time of integration of our simulations is @xmath26 @xmath3 and the snia timescale is on the order of @xmath27 gyr .      in order to model the pair of smbhs embedded in a cnd",

    "the gravitational pull at the edge of these clumps can be greater than the gravitational pull at the `` edge '' of the smbhs in our simulations , where we define the edge of an smbh to be its gravitational softening .",
    "we define the effective mass density of our black holes ( @xmath87 ) to be the mass of the black hole ( @xmath88 ) enclosed within a sphere of radius equal to the gravitational softening of the black holes ( @xmath53 ) , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "we can compare @xmath87 with the mass density of the gaseous clumps ( @xmath90 ) to determine if , in our simulations , the clumps are more compact than the black holes .",
    "for a gravitational softening of 4 pc , we find that @xmath913.8@xmath92@xmath67 . hence ,",
    "in our simulations the density of the gaseous clumps is greater than the effective mass density of the black holes .",
    "this implies that the gravitational pull at the edge of the black holes ( @xmath93 ) is typically smaller than the gravitational pull at the edge of the clumps ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "indeed , considering a gravitational softening of 4 pc , and the minimum and maximum densities of the gaseous clumps in our simulations , @xmath95 0.04 - 10 .",
    "therefore , a black hole sees the clumps as point masses , and it is not able to disrupt them when it has a close encounter with one of them , within a distance @xmath96 pc .",
    "instead , in our simulations a close encounter within this distance will result in the scattering of the black hole .",
    "if we decrease @xmath53 , we would expect the higher resolution of the black hole s gravitational force to allow the black hole to disrupt a clump in a close encounter , where the minimum distance is @xmath97 4 pc . to illustrate how decreasing @xmath53 affects the outcome of close encounters ,",
    "we show how an encounter proceeds for different values of @xmath53 in the bottom two rows of figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "snapshots that are farther to the right in this figure correspond to later times .",
    "the first row of this figure shows a different encounter one that illustrates scattering of the smbh . in the middle row ( run c0015_@xmath49.004 ) , we see that the smbh s gravitational potential disrupts the clump , and the smbh does not scatter significantly . on the other hand , in the lower row ( run c0015 ) where @xmath53 is larger , the black hole is not able to disrupt the clump .",
    "the orbit of the smbh is perturbed and the gaseous clump is scattered .",
    "+      +      +    if these close encounters , where the minimum distance between the black hole and the clump is @xmath97 4 pc , are the primary source of large fluctuations in the separation of the black holes , then we expect decreasing @xmath53 sufficiently would cause these fluctuations to disappear .",
    "more precisely , we expect the large fluctuations to disappear once @xmath98 for all clumps in the simulation .    in figures",
    "[ fig12 ] , [ fig13 ] , [ fig14 ] , [ fig15 ] , and [ fig16 ] we show the evolution of the smbhs separation for different values of @xmath53 .",
    "the smallest value that we choose for @xmath53 is still much greater than the schwarzschild radius of the black holes in our simulations ( @xmath99 pc ) .",
    "we note that , as we change @xmath53 , the orbits of the black holes change .",
    "so , in simulations with the same sfr but different @xmath53 , the black holes do nt have close encounters with the same gaseous clumps .",
    "we found that in three of our simulations ( runs c0015_@xmath49.004 , c005_@xmath49.004 , and c05_@xmath49.004 ) , making @xmath53 smaller causes the large fluctuations to disappear . as expected , the better resolution of the gravitational force of the black holes in these simulations allows them to disrupt the clumps in all close encounters .",
    "in contrast , we found that in the runs c0005_@xmath49.004 and c015_@xmath49.004 , some large fluctuations in the separation of the pair occurred ( see peaks enclosed by red circles in figures [ fig12 ] and [ fig15 ] ) that are even larger than the fluctuations observed in the simulations with the same sfr , but larger @xmath53 ( runs c0005 and c015 ) .",
    "we analyzed each of these large fluctuations to determine why they are present even when the black hole s gravitational force is resolved down to scales of @xmath100 pc , where @xmath101 is larger .",
    ".04 ( dashed purple line ) , and the run c0005_@xmath49.004 ( continuous purple line ) . in all three simulations ,",

    "[ fig17 ] , we show the evolution of the orbits of the black holes during these two large fluctuations .",
    "the upper row of figure [ fig17 ] shows the orbits of the black holes during the first of these large fluctuations , and the lower row of figure[fig17 ] shows the second of these large fluctuations .",
    "we found that these two large fluctuations occurred because the black holes follow orbits of different radius and eccentricity , but with respect to nearly the same center , which is located close to the densest and most massive gas clump of the simulation ( @xmath107@xmath67 and @xmath108 @xmath109 ) .",
    "therefore , the large fluctuations in run c0005_@xmath49.004 are not the result of close encounters with high density clumps .",
    "instead they are the result of the movement of the black holes which , at the moment of these fluctuations , are not bound together .",
    "run c015_@xmath49.004 also has two large fluctuations in the separation of the black holes ( enclosed by red circles in figure [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "we show the evolution of the orbit of the black holes during these two large fluctuations in figure [ fig18 ] . from the upper row of figure [ fig18 ]",
    ", we found that the first large fluctuation is the result of scattering of one of the black holes due to gravitational interaction with a high density gas clump .",
    "this gas clump had in turn been ejected from a past scattering with another high density gas clump . in the lower row of figure",
    "[ fig18 ] , we see that the second large fluctuation is the result of scattering with the same gas clump responsible of the first large fluctuation .",
    "both of these close encounters have a minimum distance which is greater than 10 pc , and therefore they are not artificially produced by low resolution of the gravitational force of the black holes . however , the clump that produces these two large fluctuations in the separation of the black holes is the most dense and massive clump in run c015_@xmath49.004 ( @xmath110@xmath67 and @xmath111 @xmath109 ) .",
    "so this clump is the most extreme clump in our simulation and hence , the two scatterings produced by it are highly unlikely to happen in a real cnd . we note that shortly after the last scattering ( @xmath112 2 @xmath3 ) , this clump is disrupted by one of the black holes , and after this disruption the orbital decay of the smbh pair continues relatively smoothly .",
    "intense , fluctuating gravitational torques experienced by smbh pairs in a clumpy medium have also been observed in numerical simulations by other authors ( escala et al .",
    "2004 ; fiacconi et al .",
    "2013 ; roskar et al .",

    "( 2013 ) , we estimate the effective density of the black holes and the clumps of their simulations . using figure 3 of fiacconi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we estimate that the density of their clumps range between @xmath113@xmath67 and @xmath114@xmath67 . this estimate is a lower bound for the density , because we assume that the vertical size of their clumps is comparable to the thickness of their disk .",
    "if we compare this density range with the effective density of their black holes ( which is @xmath115.@xmath116@xmath67 ) , we find that @xmath87 is typically greater than the density of their clumps and therefore their simulations do nt suffer of a bad resolved black holes force .",
    "however , from our estimation , we found that the density of these gas clumps is greater , or equal , than the density of the densest observed molecular clouds .",
    "this means that , in these simulations the stochastic gravitational torques experienced by the black holes due to the gravitational interaction with the densest gas clumps can be overestimated .",
    "we note that , although in our simulations the maximum density of the gaseous clumps is one or two order of magnitude greater , the delay on smbh orbital decay is comparable with the obtained by fiacconi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) for smbhs that are initially in a circular orbit .    in fiacconi",
    "et al . ( 2013 ) they found that the smbh orbital decay is slower for smbhs that are initially in a eccentric orbit .",
    "this dependence between the orbital decay timescale and the initial eccentricity may be caused by an indirect retarding effect on the smbh orbital decay which is stronger for smbhs in an initially eccentric orbit .",
    "this indirect effect is caused by the spiral arms produced by the high density gaseous clumps , they exert gravitational torques on the smbhs and perturb the hydrodynamical wake of the smbhs .",
    "we expect to found a similar behaviour in our simulations , however , as our simulations have star formation included , the clumps spiral arms may be transformed into stars and their indirect effect on the smbh orbital decay may be smaller than the observed in simulations without star formation . therefore , it is not clear if in our simulations a smbh that is initially in an eccentric orbit will have a slower orbital decay than a smbh that is initially in a circular orbit .",
    "+      +        +      +",
    "we studied the evolution of a pair of smbhs embedded in a star forming cnd to explore how different sfr and gas physics can result in different timescales for the orbital decay of the pair . for this purpose , we ran twenty three n - body / sph simulations . in eighteen of these simulations we used a modified version of the code in which we implemented recipes for star formation , cooling and supernovae explosions that resemble the ones used by other authors in the study of smbh pairs ( callegari et al .",
    "2011 ; van wassenhove et al . 2012",
    "; roskar et al .",
    "the other two simulations used different gas physics . in one of these simulations we used the hybrid multiphase model for star formation implemented in springel & hernquist 2003 ; springel et al .",
    "2005a ) , where it is assumed that star formation is self regulated ( simulation sdh05 ) . in the other one , the gas thermodynamics is simpler and there is no star formation ( simulation e05 ) .",
    "before the smbh pair forms a binary , their orbital decay is driven by dynamical friction coming from their gaseous environment .",
    "as this dynamical friction is density dependent , we expect the orbital decay of the smbhs to occur more quickly in simulations where the gas density of the cnd is higher .",
    "the simulations we ran with our recipes resulted in a higher mean gas density around the smbhs than simulation sdh05 , and accordingly we found the smbhs orbital decay to be faster using our recipes .",
    "however , in simulations with our recipes the orbital decay is sometimes slower than in simulation e05 , even though the gas density in these simulations is higher than in simulation e05 .",
    "this happen because in these simulations , the cnd is fragmented in a few tens of high density ( @xmath117 @xmath67 ) gaseous clumps , which erratically perturb the orbits of the smbhs , delaying their orbital decay .",
    "the density of these gaseous clumps are extremely high compared to the observed density of molecular clouds in isolated galaxies ( mathis 1990 ; struve & conway 2010 ) or ulirgs ( downes & solomon 1998 ; schulz et al .",
    "2007 ) , which is typically on the order of @xmath82@xmath67 .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that we do nt include all the different physical process that sculpt the properties of the gas clumps .",
    "for example , to properly model the formation of gas clumps in the cnd , we need to consider a more realistic cooling function which computes the effects of photons trapped inside the optically thick clumps , or follow the radiative transfer of these photons inside the clumps .",
    "also , we have to include heating due to the stars and the accretion disks of the smbhs , which can have an important effect on the temperatures and densities of the gas clumps .",
    "as the gas clumps are regions of vigorous star formation , we also expect that they will be highly turbulent .",
    "this turbulence , which would sustain the gas clumps against gravitational collapse , is also a missing ingredient in our simulations since it is damped in sph codes like .",
    "we also found that in simulations with our recipes , the density of the gas clumps is comparable to or greater than the effective mass density of the smbhs , which we define as @xmath89 ( for @xmath118 pc , this density is @xmath119@xmath67 ) .",
    "we ran simulations where the gravitational softening of the smbhs is smaller , and hence their effective mass density higher . with these simulations",
    "we show that the outcome of a close encounter , within a distance comparable with the gravitational softening , depends on the force resolution of the smbhs . if the force resolution ( i.e. gravitational softening ) is such that the effective density of the smbhs is smaller than the density of the gas clumps , a close encounter results in the scattering of the smbh . on the other hand , if the force resolution is such that the effective density of the smbhs is higher than the density of the gas clumps , a close encounter results in the tidal disruption of the gas clump and the smbh orbit is less affected .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the orbital evolution of a pair of smbhs in a clumpy cnd has a stochastic behavior , due to the gravitational interaction of the smbhs with high density gaseous clumps ( fiacconi et al .",
    "2013 ; roskar et al .",
    "however , in the simulations of these studies , as in our simulations , the densities of the denser gaseous clumps are higher than the densities of the observed , denser molecular clouds ( mathis 1990 ; oka _ et al _ 2001 ; struve & conway 2010 ) .",
    "thus , in these simulations the effect of the denser gaseous clumps on the orbital evolution of the smbhs , which is density dependent , can be overestimated .",
    "so the delay produced on the orbital decay of the smbhs by these gaseous clumps in real cnds can be even smaller than the observed in simulations .",
    "we emphasize that even though in our simulations the orbit - perturbing gravitational torques produced by these gaseous clumps are overestimated , the migration timescale is still at most a factor three longer than the migration timescale in simulations with simpler gas physics ( escala et al .",
    "2005 ; dotti et al . 2006 ) .",
    "even with this overestimation , gravitational interaction with the gas with the smbhs produces a migration timescale which is much shorter than the typical migration timescale due to gravitational interaction with a background of stars .",
    "interaction with gas yields a migration timescale on the order of @xmath1 yr , while migration timescale is on the order of one to ten gyr in the case of a triaxial distribution of stars ( berczik et al .",
    "2006 ; khan et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in our simulations",
    "we assume that the orbits of the smbhs are totally embedded in the cnd , a scenario that is expected for massive cnds .",
    "as we see in our simulations the smbhs can experience strong scatterings due to the gravitational interaction with high density clumps and we may expect that a similar type of scattering can affect the orbits of the smbhs before they reach the cnd , making their way into the cnd more difficult .",
    "for example , a smbh can have a close encounter with a globular cluster , however , the densest globular clusters have densities on the order of @xmath54 @xmath67 and therefore , as the intensity of the scattering its density dependent , their effect on the orbits of the smbhs will be much smaller than the observed in our simulations .",
    "another scenario where we may expect that a smbh experience an intense scattering is in a multiple - merger of galaxies , where multiples smbhs can coexist in a compact region .",
    "however , multiples smbhs will coexist in a compact region only if the time interval between the mergers is smaller than the timescale in which two smbhs coalesce .",
    "if this is the case , the multiple interaction of smbhs can slow down the smbh orbital decay in an analogue way as the high density gaseous clumps in our simulations retard the orbital decay of the smbh pair . for this scenario",
    "we also expect that , in a 3-body interaction some of the smbhs will be ejected from the central region of the multiple - merger .",
    "these kicked smbhs may have interesting observational consequence for multiple - merger systems like the formation of an agn spatially offset form its host galaxy , a signature which is usually associated to smbhs ejected by gravitational wave recoil kicks ( schnittman et al .",
    "2008 , blecha et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , to determine the relevance of this scenario a detail statistic of the timescale between mergers in multiple - merger systems and the dynamics of the gas and stars on these systems is needed .    from our numerical study and previous studies of binaries embedded in gaseous circumbinary disks ( escala et al . 2005 ; dotti et al .",
    "2006 ; cuadra et al .",
    "2009 ) , we conclude that from the moment the smbhs are separated by hundreds of parsecs until shortly after they form a binary , sfr has a much smaller effect on their orbits than cavity formation in the cnd does .",
    "( this cavity formation is the result of inefficient viscous dissipation of angular momentum extracted from the binary ( del valle & escala 2012 , 2014 ) .",
    "indeed , we show that for a two order of magnitude of difference on the sfr the migration timescale only change in a factor of two , and in comparison , the formation of a cavity in the cnd can extend the migration timescale by two orders of magnitude .",
    "however , since we are limited by the resolution of our simulations , we do nt explore for a sufficiently long period the effects of the star formation on the evolution of the smbhs after they form a binary .",
    "amaro - seoane et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have made advances in this direction by studying the evolution of an smbh binary which resides inside the central cavity of a star - forming gaseous circumbinary disk .",
    "their results indicate that star formation slows the orbital decay of the binary .",
    "however , they do not explore how star formation affects the evolution of an smbh binary when it is embedded in a circumbinary disk without a gap , a regime in which the gravitational torque of the gas on the binary is stronger .    as a future work",
    ", the effects of the star formation on the orbital evolution of an smbh binary embedded in a circumbinary disk without a gap should be explored .",
    "we also need to model the gas around the binary more realistically .",
    "ultimately , we would like to determine if the gas can extract sufficient angular momentum from the smbh binary to drive its separation down to scales small enough for gravitational radiation to take over , ensuring coalescence of the smbhs .",
