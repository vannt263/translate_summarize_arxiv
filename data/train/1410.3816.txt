    "the system is composed of a set of elements interconnected forming a scale - free undirected random network .",
    "every node can present two states , active and inactive , and the dynamics that governs their state is similar to the standard sis model .",
    "nodes flip from one state to the other following a poisson process with probability densities @xmath70 for activation and @xmath71 for deactivation . in particular",
    ", a node @xmath72 flips from the active to the inactive state at a constant rate @xmath12 , while its activation rate is proportional to the number of active nodes to which it is connected , @xmath73 . in the latter sum , @xmath74 if node @xmath75 is active at time @xmath76 and @xmath77 otherwise ; similarly , @xmath78 if and only if nodes @xmath72 and @xmath75 are connected .",
    "we now show that @xmath79 is , after the system has reached the steady - state , approximately time - independent and proportional to the degree of the node @xmath80  @xcite ; we will refer to it as @xmath11 . to derive its expression",
    ", we first apply a coarse - graining approximation by assuming that all nodes with the same degree @xmath5 are equivalent and statistically independent . under this approximation ,",
    "the state of the system is characterized by the fraction of nodes in the active state in every degree class , @xmath81 where @xmath82 stands for the number of nodes with degree @xmath5 in the network .",
    "since we are assuming all nodes with the same degree to be statistically independent , @xmath83 yields the probability that a randomly chosen node with degree @xmath5 is active .",
    "hence , the probability that a randomly chosen link emerging from a node with degree @xmath5 reaches an active node can be computed as @xmath84 , i.e. , the probability that the link reaches a node with degree @xmath9 , @xmath85 , and that such node is active , @xmath86 , summed for all @xmath9 . in the case of uncorrelated random networks , @xmath87 , so the probability for a link to connect to an active node becomes degree independent , @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , in the steady - state it takes an almost constant value @xmath89 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wprevalence ] ) , which allows us to compute the average number of active neighbors of a node with degree @xmath5 as @xmath90 .",
    "hence , @xmath91    in addition to the sis - like dynamics , we let nodes produce while they are in the active state with a probability density @xmath0 , which need not be exponential .",
    "it is therefore important to note that , if @xmath92 gives the probability for the time interval between two consecutive production events to fall into @xmath93 ( for a node that is active along all the process ) , the probability density for the interval between the activation time and the first production event @xmath20 is , in general , given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the average production interval and @xmath96 is the survival probability distribution ( the probability that the interval is greater than @xmath76 ) .",
    "we will use the same notation for the activation and deactivation probabilities as well : @xmath97 will refer to the survival probability of @xmath98 . to justify eq .",
    ", let us consider a sequence of @xmath99 events @xmath100 distributed with probability density @xmath0 ( so the whole process takes a time @xmath101 ) and calculate @xmath102 , i.e. , the probability that an activation event falls at a distance between @xmath76 and @xmath103 from the next production event . assuming that the activation event is uniformly distributed along the interval @xmath104 , the probability for it to fall in any interval of length @xmath105 is simply @xmath106 . in our case , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the number of intervals greater than @xmath76 , since there is an interval of length @xmath109 placed at distance @xmath76 from the next production event in every production interval greater than @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , @xmath110",
    "in the latter section we have reduced the study of the system to that of a single node that activates with rate @xmath11 given by eq .  , deactivates with rate @xmath12 and produces in the active state with probability densities @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "we now compute the probability @xmath112 that two consecutive production events take place in the interval @xmath113 taking into account the fact that the state of the node can flip any number of times between the two events ( as long as it is in the active state during both productions ) .",
    "it is easy to see that if it does not flip to the inactive state during the process , @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 ( the probability that it does not deactivate in a time less than @xmath76 and that it produces in the given interval ) .",
    "similarly , we can compute the probability that it deactivates only once between both productions ; however , in this case we have to integrate for all possible deactivation and activation times ( let us call them @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively ) , yielding @xmath118 . following the same procedure ,",
    "we can write the total probability density as the series @xmath119 we do not need to solve the series , since we are only interested in the first two moments of the distribution to obtain @xmath34 . to this end , we make use of the laplace transform formalism , which is particularly convenient for two reasons . on the one hand ,",
    "the @xmath120-th moment of a distribution @xmath111 can be obtained as the @xmath120-th derivative of its transform @xmath121 , @xmath122 . on the other hand ,",

    "we can write the latter result in terms of @xmath0 only by plugging the expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath71 into it and using @xmath126 @xmath127 and @xmath128 the final expression for @xmath121 reads @xmath129^{2}}{\\frac{s + \\lambda_{eff}(k)}{\\lambda_{eff}(k ) } - \\frac{\\lambda_{i}}{s + \\lambda_{i } } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1 - \\hat{\\psi } ( s + \\lambda_{i})}{\\langle t",

    "its laplace transform is given by @xmath146 so eq .   becomes @xmath147 evaluating its first and second derivatives at @xmath35 and using normalized parameters @xmath148 and @xmath140 gives @xmath149 @xmath150 and @xmath151",
    "let us focus on the case of a single node that produces with an arbitrary @xmath0 and consider several limiting cases .",
    "in order to define a timescale , we set @xmath152 throughout all this section without loss of generality ( so the ratios @xmath153 and @xmath154 to which we will refer become simply @xmath12 and @xmath155 ) .",
    "in the limit of @xmath156 , the fraction of production intervals interrupted by a deactivation goes to zero , so the resulting probability density function @xmath157 .",
    "this result can also be derived by taking the limit of eq .",
    "as @xmath156 , since @xmath158 .",
    "notice , however , that this limit is slightly different to the limit @xmath159 and fixed @xmath160 ( which gives @xmath161 ) ; the reason is that , in the present case , when taking the limit @xmath162 for a fixed @xmath154 , the ratio @xmath163 obviously remains constant , i.e. the interrupted intervals become less frequent but not longer than uninterrupted ones . on the other hand , taking the limit @xmath159 for a fixed @xmath160 gives @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , even though interrupted intervals become less frequent , they become much longer than uninterrupted intervals as well , hence yielding a bursty behavior .",
    "that is why , when working with the normalized parameters @xmath165 and @xmath166 , @xmath40 must be increased too in order to recover the original burstiness coefficient @xmath167 ( as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : theo_reduction1 ] ) .    for intermediate values of the deactivation rate @xmath168",
    ", the fraction of production events interrupted by a deactivation may be significant ; there is , on average , one production event per unit time during the active state , while there are @xmath12 interruptions per unit time .",
    "therefore , approximately one out of every @xmath169 production intervals is interrupted .",
    "in addition , the average time the node remains in the inactive state is @xmath170 , so if @xmath171 , @xmath169 production events buffer during the active state according to @xmath0 and are followed by a long period of inactivity .",
    "hence , the resulting distribution becomes burstier than the original .    in the opposite case ( @xmath172 ) ,",
    "the production process becomes poisson regardless of @xmath0 ; since @xmath173 , the probability that the node produces during an active period ( which we will denote by @xmath174 ) is very small , and we can regard the process as a succession of active and inactive states of average length @xmath175 , each of which with an independent production probability @xmath174 . under this approximation , we can easily compute the probability that two consecutive production events take place in a time interval @xmath176 greater than @xmath76 as the probability for the node not to produce in any of @xmath177 intervals , @xmath178 furthermore , @xmath174 can be estimated as well for any @xmath0 .",
    "its exact expression is given by @xmath179 since we are considering the limit of @xmath173 , the probability that a production interval is greater than @xmath180 is approximately one , so @xmath181 in the range of small values of @xmath76 in which the exponential term in the integrand is not close to zero .",
    "hence , we can approximate eq .",
    "as @xmath182 we therefore see that the production process becomes exponentially distributed with mean @xmath183 which is in accordance with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu_reg],[eq : mu_ind ] ) .",
    "this result can also be obtained by taking the limit of @xmath121 as @xmath172 assuming @xmath184 and @xmath185 from all the stated above , we can conclude that the network dynamics can be used to control the production of nodes between three regimes of special interest : the endogenous production behavior , a bursty process and a poisson process ( see table  [ tab : behaviours ] ) .",
    "furthermore , these results are completely general and independent of the functional form of @xmath0 ( as long as eq",

    "the iai dynamics is simulated using the continuous - time gillespie algorithm .",
    "in addition , at every deactivation event the deactivated node s production is updated by generating random intervals with distributions @xmath20 for the first one and @xmath0 for the rest of them .",
    "the initial condition for all simulations is @xmath186 ( all nodes active ) , but we only measure nodes @xmath39 for simulation times @xmath187 , since the system reaches a stationary state before that value ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : wprevalence ] ) .",
    "we stop simulations when all nodes have produced at least @xmath188 times , so enough statistics are guaranteed .    in figs .  2 and 3 in the paper ,",
    "the simulation parameters have been chosen in such a way that a wide heterogeneity of behaviours is exhibited ; in figs .",
    "2a and 3b , every simulation corresponds to a different value of @xmath189 between @xmath190 and @xmath191 , so @xmath6 takes values approximately between @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "since the degree of nodes is between @xmath194 and @xmath195 , @xmath63 is approximately in the intervals @xmath196 for @xmath197 and @xmath198 for @xmath199 . from fig .",
    "1 it can be seen that for @xmath200 , @xmath167 lies about the middle of the interval in which @xmath39 can be varied ; we have set @xmath56 .",

    "2b and 3c @xmath201 is fixed , so @xmath202 and hence @xmath203 .",
    "given that @xmath62 and @xmath42 are varied over 4 orders of magnitude , a wide range of @xmath39 values is obtained .",
    "in this section we present some results not included in the paper . in fig .",

    "<S> , we measured @xmath34 from simulations on a network with @xmath53 nodes ( simulation details in appendix  [ sec : simulation ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> although our results are valid in the variety of uncorrelated network topologies , we used a scale - free network with characteristic exponent @xmath54 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : theo_reduction2]a , we show simulation results of @xmath34 for different values of @xmath55 . for all activation rates , a strong inverse dependence of effective burstiness on degree can indeed be observed . for high degree nodes </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath34 is noticeably below @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that hubs do not remain in the inactive state for much time since they are usually connected to many active nodes that constantly reactivate them .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath55 still allows to control the duration of inactive periods for low degree nodes . for low values of @xmath55 ( but above the minimum required to sustain the activity ) , low degree nodes remain a long time in the inactive state , which raises their effective burstiness well above @xmath48 , while for high values of @xmath55 they behave as high degree nodes approaching a minimum value of @xmath34 independent of @xmath5 , a basal level below @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the bursty production of nodes can be regulated by network - driven stochastic activation dynamics that splits the originally uniform endogenous burstiness in a range of values anti - correlated with degree .    </S>",

    "<S> , we find again that @xmath34 is always a decreasing function of @xmath5 ( but always above @xmath60 ) . due to their sustained activity , hubs are less susceptible to display induced burstiness production . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , nodes with low degree stay in the inactive state for longer periods and are more prone to present a raised effective burstiness . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , both parameters @xmath62 and @xmath55 can control similarly the induction of bustiness , affecting all nodes more efficiently for higher values of @xmath62 and lower values of @xmath55 . again , the disparity of induced burstiness values reaches a maximum at some intermediate parameter levels </S>",

    "<S> tend to decrease burstiness in their endogenous pattern of production , hence helping to maintain a stable bulk level , at the expenses of low degree nodes being more pliable to the regulatory effect of the network that tends to amplify their fluctuations . at the same time , lower degree nodes are more prone to burstiness induction . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that a heterogenous network structure protects the functioning of some nodes , the hubs , making low degree nodes better targets for engineering actions to produce local modifications of production without critically affecting the behavior of the whole system . taken together </S>",
    "<S> , our findings suggest that heterogeneous network interconnectivity may be a strategy in itself developed to protect complex systems against unpredictable functional fluctuations . </S>",
