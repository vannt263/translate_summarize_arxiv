    "recent sets of global parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite have reached a sufficiently high level of accuracy that quantization and propagation of statistical errors have become important issues @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , even more unsettling that the strange quark pdf , @xmath3 , remains a mystery @xcite without a fully consistent picture emerging from the comparative analysis between neutrino and muon structure functions @xcite , opposite sign dimuon production in @xmath4-dis @xcite , or the recently measured parity violating structure function @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "given the high precision of the non - strange pdf components , this situation for @xmath3 is unacceptable both in terms of our understanding of the nucleon structure , and for our ability to use precise flavor information to make predictions for present and future experiments .    for extracting the strange quark pdf , the dimuon data provide the most direct determination .",
    "the basic channel is the weak charged current process @xmath6 with a subsequent charm decay @xmath7 .",
    "these events provide a direct probe of the @xmath8-vertex , and hence the strange quark pdf . which must then be extracted from a linear combination of structure functions in the context of the qcd parton model . ] for this reason , fixed - target neutrino dimuon production will provide a unique perspective on the strange quark distribution of the nucleon in the foreseeable future . besides , hera provides a large dynamic range in @xmath9 for the cp conjugated process @xmath10 which is valuable for testing the underlying qcd evolution @xcite . within the hermes experimental program @xcite the flavor structure of the polarized and unpolarized sea",
    "are studied from semi - inclusive dis where dis kaon production has obvious potential to probe strangeness .",
    "thus , hera and hermes can complement fixed - target neutrino dimuon data with information at different energies and from different processes ; therefore , neutrino dis serves for now as an important benchmark process to perform rigorous and refined comparisons between the experimental data and the theoretical calculations . in the long run",
    ", a high luminosity neutrino factory could , of course , considerably raise the accuracy of present day information from @xmath11 dis @xcite .",
    "the theoretical calculations of inclusive charged current charm production have been carefully studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "additionally , the charm fragmentation spectrum has also been calculated in detail @xcite . while inclusive calculations are sufficient for many tasks , a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data at nlo requires additional information from the theoretical side . in",
    "charged current @xmath11-fe charm production , the detector acceptance depends on the full range of kinematic variables : @xmath12.-dependence is controlled to be flat by rotational symmetry around the axis of the boson - target frame .",
    "it is , therefore , not indicated . ] here , @xmath13 is the bjorken-@xmath13 , @xmath14 is the virtuality of the @xmath15-boson , @xmath16 is the scaled energy of the charm after fragmentation , and @xmath17 is charm rapidity .",
    "the theoretical task is , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", not too different from the extraction of the neutral current charm structure function @xmath18 as performed by the hera experiments @xcite ; this analysis uses the theoretical calculation of the differential cross section @xcite to extrapolate into regions of poor acceptance .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in",
    ", we discuss the key factors that influence the acceptance of the experimental detector . in section [ sec : theor ] , we review the theoretical calculation of the fully differential cross section at nlo in qcd @xcite . in",
    "we present numerical results for typical fixed target kinematics .",
    "finally , in , we draw our conclusions .",
    "dimuon events from neutrino charged current charm production can provide a clear set of events from which to study the strange sea . their signature in a detector is a pair of oppositely charged muons and a hadronic shower originating from the same vertex .",
    "the second muon is produced in the semileptonic decay of the charmed particle .",
    "detector geometry and applied cuts affect how these events are reconstructed , and must be corrected for when making measurements of the underlying charm production .",
    "these corrections require a cross section differential in variables in addition to the typical @xmath19 , and @xmath9 or @xmath20 of the charged current cross section .    to seperate dimuon events from backgrounds a minimum energy requirement",
    "must be applied to the muon from charm decay . for the muon to be visible at all , it must first be energetic enough that it travels further in the detector than the particles which make up the hadronic shower .",
    "the background from muons from nonprompt decays of pions and kaons within the shower is large at low energy , and must also be reduced .",
    "typically a cut on the charm decay muon s energy of a few gev is applied to guarantee it be reconstructable , and to reduce the nonprompt backgrounds .",
    "the energy of the decay muon depends on the energy of the charmed meson from which it decays , and therefore depends on the fragmentation parameter @xmath16 . in nlo",
    ", it also depends on the rapidity of the charmed quark , which maps onto the @xmath15-parton cms scattering angle .",
    "a charmed meson with low @xmath16 , and/or low rapidity will be less likely to pass a cut on the decay muon s energy than one with high @xmath16 and maximalrapidity .",
    "in addition , the linear construction of typical fixed target neutrino detectors can adversely affect the reconstruction of decay muons with large scattering angles .",
    "considering these effects , it is important that the charm production cross section s dependence on both @xmath16 and charm rapidity be understood to be able to model dimuon events and their detector acceptance properly .",
    "[ fig : acc ] illustrates the effect of a decay muon energy and angle cut on @xmath16 and rapidity acceptance at a particular @xmath19 , and @xmath9 point .",
    "a toy monte carlo was constructed that generated charmed mesons with flat distributed @xmath16 and charm rapidity , and decayed them into muons following @xcite .",
    "detector smearing effects were not included .",
    "the figure shows muon acceptance after a 5 gev cut on energy , and a maximum scattering angle cut of 0.250 radians , as a function of @xmath16 and charm rapidity for @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the acceptance is a smooth function in both kinematic variables , but flattens out as @xmath16 approaches 1 and rapidity approaches its maximum value . to properly correct for acceptance",
    "the cross section must be differential where the slope is nonzero , but in regions where the acceptance is flat , the dependence on these variables may be safely integrated out ; i.e.    we conclude that the integrated acceptance correction @xmath24 \\frac{d \\sigma}{dx\\ dq^2\\ dz\\ d \\eta}\\ ] ] does not resolve any local deviations of @xmath25 around some point @xmath26 within a range where @xmath27 \\times ( z - z_0)$ ] and @xmath28 \\times ( \\eta - \\eta_0)$ ] are smaller than the typical mc accuracy . in our example , these conditions are safely met within a range of , say , 1 unit in rapidity and 0.2 units in @xmath16 away from the phase space boundary .",
    "recorded charged - current charm production rates must be corrected for the detector acceptance which , as discussed above , depends on the full range of kinematic variables : @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , we must obtain the nlo theoretical cross section which is completely differential in all these variables .    while @xmath13 and @xmath9 are fixed by the energy and angle of the scattered muon , the variables @xmath16 and @xmath30 relate to the center - of - mass - system ( cms ) phase space of the hard partonic scattering event , which at _ leading - order _ ( lo ) is @xmath31 . at nlo ,",
    "the quark - initiated process ( @xmath32 ) receives virtual and real corrections , and we encounter a new gluon - initiated process , @xmath33 . neglecting bottom contributions , we denote the ckm - rotated weak eigenstate with @xmath34 , which is defined as : @xmath35 similarly , we will use @xmath36 to denote its qcd evolution partner , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath37 .",
    "the nlo 2-particle partonic phase space in @xmath38 dimensions ( appropriate for a single charm quark of mass @xmath39 , plus a massless gluon or strange quark ) is : @xmath40^\\varepsilon\\ \\int_0 ^ 1\\ \\left[{\\hat{y}}(1-{\\hat{y } } ) \\right]^\\varepsilon\\ d{\\hat{y } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that there is only one independent variable ; momentum coordinates , minus @xmath41 mass shell conditions , minus @xmath42 energy momentum conserving conditions , minus @xmath43 rotational symmetry around the cms axis . ] in , this has been chosen to be @xmath44 , with @xmath45 being the @xmath46-parton cms scattering angle .",
    "the expression for the phase space in leaves us two options for computing the cross section : i ) we can either integrate over the entire phase space , or ii ) we can compute a singly - differential distribution .",
    "we can construct any singly - differential cross section as follows .",
    "if the variable @xmath47 stands for any kinematic variable that can be expressed through @xmath48 and partonic cms energy @xmath49 , we can easily obtain the differential cross section with respect to @xmath47 with the appropriate jacobian via the relation : @xmath50 .",
    "as above , @xmath44 and the partonic cms energy is given by : @xmath51 with @xmath52 defined below in ( [ eq : xip ] ) . in our case",
    ", we consider a distribution singly - differential in @xmath53 , the partonic fragmentation variable @xmath54 which reduces to the scaled energy of the unobservable ( colored ) charm quark , @xmath55 , in the target rest frame .",
    "after fragmentation the observable ( colorless ) charm hadron ( collectively labeled a @xmath56-meson ) carries some smaller energy @xmath57 .",
    "the unobservable variable @xmath53 is convoluted with a fragmentation function to compute the observable cc dis hadronic charm structure functions : @xmath58 d_c(\\frac{z}{\\zeta } ) \\ \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in , @xmath59 is the fragmentation function ( often parameterized in the form of peterson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath16 is the scaled charm hadron energy , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    the outer convolution integral over the variable @xmath63 folds in the quark and gluon pdfs .",
    "we take the factorization scale @xmath64 used in the pdfs equal to the renormalization scale @xmath65 used in @xmath66 .",
    "we find it convenient to normalize our @xmath67 relative to the conventional cc dis structure functions @xmath68 as follows:@xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we adopt the standard normalization of semi - inclusive structure functions as implicitly defined through @xmath72 with @xmath73 any set of kinematic variables .",
    "the form of the hard - scattering coefficients , @xmath74 , can be found in @xcite .",
    "these hard - scattering coefficients , @xmath74 , are mathematical distributions containing both dirac-@xmath75 and ( generalized ) _ plus _ distributions arising from the soft singularities and mass singularities present in the nlo qcd calculation . to map these distributions into c - numbers , smooth test functions are required ; normally , it is the parton distribution functions and the fragmentation functions that serve as these smooth test functions .",
    "convolutions over _ both _ @xmath76 and @xmath53 are necessary to guarantee c - number results for the hadronic structure function on the left - hand - side ( lhs ) of ; the convolution over @xmath76 folds in the pdfs , and the convolution over @xmath53 folds in the fragmentation function .    in light of the above discussion",
    ", we clearly see that if we require structure functions which are fully differential in all four variables , such as @xmath77 which is required to compute the experimental detector acceptance , we will be left with unphysical dirac-@xmath75 and _ plus _ distributions .",
    "let us note that we are facing a new problem that is intimately related to the single - charm kinematics of charged - current dis .",
    "there is no direct lesson to be learnt from the pair - production kinematics of the well - understood neutral - current case @xcite where the phase space has more degrees of freedom .",
    "we now turn to address this question .",
    "suppose we wish to compute the structure function which is differential in four variables . as a specific example",
    ", we will choose @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the transverse momentum of the charm particle in the boson - parton cms frame .",
    "from and we will find @xmath78 contains mathematical distributions of the form : @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 . the @xmath75-function distributions arise from the diagrams that have lo ( @xmath83 ) kinematics , whereas the plus - distributions arise from diagrams with nlo ( @xmath84 ) .    in principle",
    ", c - numbers are ultimately obtained from the @xmath78 distribution after convolution with a smooth detector - resolution function in a mc program .",
    "while such an approach may work in principle , there are many inherent difficulties trying to interface mathematical @xmath75-function distributions and plus - distributions with a complex detector simulation mc program .    in the next sections ,",
    "we first look at the source of the singularities which appear in the theoretical calculation , and then find a means to extract the relevant distributions in an expeditious manner .",
    "as mentioned above , if we compute the fully differential @xmath85 , or equivalently @xmath78 , the final state is over - constrained and this yields an unphysical delta - function distribution in the observable cross section . while such a distribution will yield sensible results for any integrated observable , the full differential distribution @xmath86 will contain unphysical singularities .",
    "this affliction is the limitation of our fixed - order perturbation theory ; were we able to perform an all - orders calculation , such singular distributions would never occur  as is appropriate for a physical process . in our particular case",
    ", the singular behavior of our fixed - order perturbation theory would be resolved were we to include soft gluon emissions as in the familiar sudakov process .",
    "we will briefly review the sudakov resummation of soft gluon emissions off massless particles , and then assess how best to work with @xmath85 for non - zero charm mass .",
    "one of the early resummations of the qcd logarithms of the form @xmath87 arising from soft gluon emissions was performed by dokshitzer , diakonov and troian ( ddt ) @xcite .",
    "they obtained the leading - log sudakov form factor which can be written generically as : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the transverse momentum of a massless particle produced in dis divided by fragmentation-@xmath16 .",
    "the net result of this sudakov form factor is to smear the @xmath90 distribution from a singular delta - function , to a more physical form  often taken to be a gaussian . )",
    "represents a formal resummation of the soft - gluon emissions . the non - perturbative sudakov form factor ( @xmath91 ) is introduced to deal with the singularities in the perturbative coupling at @xmath92 at @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "separately , contopanagos and sterman @xcite developed a principal value resummation which provides a prescription for regularizing this singularity .",
    "more recently , ellis and veseli @xcite derived a technique that operates purely in @xmath94 without resorting to a bessel transform to b - space . ]    the phenomenological approach we will take in this paper is divided into two steps .    1 .",
    "we regularize the nlo calculation of @xmath85 to provide a numerical distribution free of delta - functions and plus - distributions .",
    "2 .   this result is input to a monte carlo ( mc ) calculation where the additional effects , including iterated soft gluon emmisions , is modeled by a gaussian distribution that has been fit to data .    to ensure that we have an accurate representation of the differential distribution suitable for evaluating the experimental acceptance and extracting the strange - quark pdf ,",
    "we need to verify that the net smearing due to step 1 ) and step 2 ) combine to yield the smearing measured by experiment .    the transverse momentum of charmed particles about the direction of the charm quark has been measured by the lebc ehs collaboration @xcite , and by the neutrino emulsion experiment fnal - e531 @xcite .",
    "they fit to a gaussian distribution : @xmath95 with @xmath96 on the order of @xmath97 mev .",
    "this observation implies that the details of the specific regularization procedure are inconsequential ; they can simply be compensated by adjusting the smearing of the monte carlo so that the net smearing ( regularization plus monte carlo ) yield the experimental transverse momentum distribution .",
    "effectively , this parameterizes the gluon resummation of the sudakov form factor . in practice",
    ", we can proceed along items * a ) * or * b ) * of section [ sec : fully ] and adjust the regularization parameters by either varying the @xmath96 in the @xmath98 function in below , or by varying the bin width differential distribution .",
    "this cross - check ensures that we have an accurate representation of the differential distribution suitable for evaluating the experimental acceptance and extracting the strange - quark pdf .",
    "we now discuss the implementation of this procedure in the following section .",
    "as demonstrated above , the singular distributions are nothing but an unphysical artifact of regularized perturbation theory ; for any physically observable quantity , these singularities will be smeared by soft gluon emission to yield physical c - number distributions @xcite .",
    "as the theoretical machinery of soft gluon resummation is not fully developed for semi - inclusive dis heavy quark production , we will use a phenomenological approach .- distribution could be measured .",

    "* gaussian @xmath90-smearing : * we may smear the singular peak which appear in the differential structure functions . *",
    "[ b ] * binning : * we may map the singular distributions onto c - numbers distributions by integrating over bins which reflect the finite resolution of the experimental detector .",
    "we examine these possibilities in order .",

    "( [ eq : diff ] ) corresponds to a replacement @xmath107 with @xmath108 understood as a function of @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "additionally , this technique can avoid passing negative weights to the mc if the bin size is sufficiently large enough to allow the kln theorem to effect its cancellations .",
    "this point will be further discussed in section [ sec : num ] .    in practice",
    ", the binning means that in we make the replacement @xmath109 where the step function @xmath110 if @xmath111 is inside the bin @xmath112 over which to integrate , and zero otherwise .",
    "note , this means that @xmath113 is subject to the distribution prescriptions of the original @xmath74 as given in refs .",
    "@xcite ; _ i.e. _ , @xmath113 must be treated with care as a multiplicative factor to the non - singular `` test - function '' part of the @xmath74 .",
    "we will briefly comment why we favor implementing the binning of choice b ) as opposed to the gaussian @xmath90-smearing . for the present case of the charm transverse momentum , @xmath114 , ( or equivalently , the charm rapidity @xmath115 ) , gaussian @xmath90-smearing leads to a integrable but delicately singular behavior near the boundary of phase space  which corresponds to the singular point of the distributions  unless we smear the @xmath79 variable with a width @xmath102 as large as @xmath116 .    in the context of resummation of soft gluon emissions into the sudakov form factor , the width @xmath102",
    "should be tied to a scale characteristic of the soft processes within the hadron , possibly with a logarithmic growth @xcite . for fixed - target neutrino dis",
    ", @xmath117 represents a comparatively large transverse momentum . additionally , there is the complication of the normalization of the gaussian given the constraints of the phase space boundaries .",
    "consequently , while the gaussian @xmath90-smearing may have a simple intuitive interpretation , we find the second method of using finite width bins to be more economical in terms of cpu time and numerical stability .",
    "results for this approach with @xmath47 identified with charm rapidity @xmath17 will be presented in the next section .",
    "we have previously addressed in section [ sec : theor ] the complication of mapping mathematical distributions onto c - number functions by the introduction of bins .",
    "we also encounter large and negative sudakov logarithms close to the phase space boundary where , at fixed - order , soft single - gluon emission is enhanced .",
    "let us , for illustration , consider the convolution of a plus - distribution @xmath118 , and a sufficiently smooth and monotonically decreasing test function @xmath119 . then",
    ", the integral @xmath120 will be positive for @xmath121 not too close to @xmath43 .",
    "as in this simplified `` toy '' case , the sudakov logarithms near the phase space boundary diverge in the limit of zero bin - width [ @xmath122 in ( ) ] ; as we increase our resolution via narrow binning , we begin to resolve the unphysical @xmath75-functions and `` plus - distributions . ''",
    "conversely , by using broad bins , we are effectively integrating over enough phase - space so that the kln theorem ensures that we obtain positive physical results .",
    "we now compute the normalized differential charm production cross section : @xmath123^{-1}\\ ] ] we can compute @xmath124 from the master equation for the differential structure function , , with the binning procedure defined by . for our variables ,",

    ", the charm rapidity is defined by : @xmath127 and the other necessary variables are : @xmath128 we find the charm rapidity to be a convenient variable as the relation between the rapidity in the partonic center of mass system , @xmath129 and the rapidity in collinear target rest frame @xmath17 are related by a simple relation : @xmath130\\ ] ] we will use the collinear target rest frame as our reference frame since it is related to the laboratory frame by a simple spatial rotation which depends on an event - by - event basis on the kinematics of the leptonic vertex .      in and we present results for kinematics typical of a wide - band neutrino beam on a fixed target : @xmath131 , @xmath22 , @xmath132 .",
    "we plot @xmath25 in 2-dimensions _ vs. _",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 in , and in we show 1-dimensional slices for distinct bins in @xmath16 plotted against @xmath17 . comparing -a and -b , we see the effect of the narrow- and wide - binning .",
    "finally , in , we show results for @xmath133 as defined by for the case where either @xmath17 or @xmath16 is integrated out ; again , we display this for fine - binnings of 1@xmath134100 or 100@xmath1341 , and broad - binnings of 1@xmath1345 or 10@xmath1341 .",
    "( rapidity integrated out ) reproduces the integrated results in the literature @xcite ] .",
    "as expected , the negative sudakov logarithms occur at large @xmath16 where we have @xmath135 in the integrand .-",

    "in contrast , in the case of broad binning ( -b ) and large @xmath16 ( dotted curve , corresponding to @xmath138 $ ] ) , the @xmath17-distribution remains positive throughout the full @xmath16-range .",
    "similarly , the @xmath16-distribution in ( -a ) is rendered positively definite if the binning is broadened at large-@xmath16 .",
    "hence , we observe that negative weights can be easily avoided by using sufficiently broad bins in a reasonable broadening of the binning    to summarize , we observe that the negative differential distributions arising from the negative sudakov logarithms yield unphysical singular components present in our fixed - order result .",
    "when sufficiently broad bins are chosen , these singular components integrate out to yield a positive definite binned result . in an actual experimental analysis , this requirement of broad bins",
    "arises naturally given the finite detector resolution .",
    "our use of bins to regularize the differential distributions will have negligible impact on the experimental analysis because our bin size is small compared to the experimental detector resolution , even more so because the detector acceptance is a smooth function in terms of the set of kinematic variables .",
    "in particular , while the exact choice of bins is subject to any experimental analysis , the geometry of typical neutrino detectors as reflected in the acceptance functions of fig .  [",
    "fig : acc ] demonstrates the effective experimental bin size in @xmath16 and @xmath17 is large enough for the purpose of regularizing the differential distributions with the binning technique .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us note that in the lowest-@xmath16 curves of , one observes ",
    "apart from the forward peak at @xmath135 typical of an @xmath139 event  a broader backward plateau stemming from the scattering off a collinear ( in the boson - target cms ) charm quark . for the fixed target kinematics under consideration ,",
    "this backward peak is seen to be strongly suppressed compared to the forward peak .",
    "this observation gives us confidence that one is actually measuring the scattering off strange quarks , with only a small dilution from charm quarks .",
    "hence , this verifies the opposite sign dimuon data provides a direct determination of @xmath3 at nlo level .",
    "we have presented a fully differential nlo calculation of the neutrino - induced dis charm production process .",
    "this calculation is an essential ingredient for a complete analysis of the dimuon data , and will allow a precise determination of the strange quark pdf .",
    "we have demonstrated that by binning the data appropriately , we can interface the theoretical calculation ( containing @xmath75-functions and `` plus - distributions '' ) directly to the experimental monte carlo analysis program .",
    "we observe the enhancement of the sudakov logarithms at the phase - space boundaries , and verify that these can be controlled with this binning method .",
    "the fully differential distributions obtained here allow charged current neutrino dis experiments to use the complete nlo qcd result in the monte carlo data analysis .",
