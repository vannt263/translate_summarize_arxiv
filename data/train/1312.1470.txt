    "taking into account the excited states of mesons plays an important role in the description of hadronic interactions at low energies .",
    "nowadays , the properties of the radially excited mesons are studied at different colliders like vepp-2000 ( novosibirsk ) , bepc - ii ( beijing ) etc .    however , we still do not have any solid experimental data in this domain . therefore",
    ", the theoretical study of the excited states of mesons is of apparent interest . the present work is devoted to the solution of one of these problems .",
    "let us note that for description of the low - energy interactions of mesons in the ground states the @xmath6 standard nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model can be successfully used @xcite . on the other hand , for the description of the first radial excitations of mesons",
    "the extended njl model was proposed @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the excited states are described with a form factor in the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a slope parameter , * k * is transversal quark momentum , and @xmath9 is a constant defining the meson masses . as a result , the mass spectrum and strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions of mesons were described @xcite .",
    "let us emphasize that extra difficulties appear in the description of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "indeed , even considering only ground states one has to take into account the singlet - octet mixing caused by the gluon anomaly ( @xmath10-problem ) .",
    "this problem is usually solved by adding the t hooft interaction @xcite .    however , considering radially excited states of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons one has to take into account the mixing of the ground and excited states . in order to describe both mixings simultaneously ,",
    "it is necessary to use the @xmath11 matrix .",
    "this matrix was obtained in @xcite and successfully applied to describe the masses of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons and the processes involving them @xcite . in the present work",
    "this matrix is used for the description of radiative decays of the radially excited @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the lagrangians of the @xmath6 standard and the extended njl models describing the quark - meson interactions . in section 3 ,",
    "the amplitudes and widths of the radiative decays of the processes considered in this paper are given .",
    "the comparison of calculations within the standard and extended njl models with experimental data is also shown .",
    "the predictions for the decay widths of the excited pseudoscalar mesons are made in section 4 . in conclusion our results",
    "are briefly discussed . in the appendix the problem concerning pseudoscalar ",
    "axial - vector ( p - a ) transitions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is discussed .",
    "we give the alternative results for the processes considered here without taking into account p - a transitions .",

    "one can see that the agreement between the theoretical and experimental results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 is not as good as for pions .",
    "it can be explained by the fact that in the case of pions the chiral symmetry breaking is connected only with small non - zero current quark mass , and in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons there is also heavier s - quark and singlet - octet mixing .",

    "however , for @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons the corresponding partners among the isoscalar axial - vector mesons do not exist .",
