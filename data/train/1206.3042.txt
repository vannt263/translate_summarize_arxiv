    "meteorites are a partial sample of asteroids that survive the passage through the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the identification of the source regions of the different type of meteorites is essential to be able to link the mineralogical properties of meteorites to the parent asteroids and , consequently , to address the mineralogical evolution in the asteroid belt .",
    "however , this is not an easy task and only some of these links could be established : for instance , the group of howardites , eucrites , and diogenites ( heds ) meteorites are thought to come from the vesta family of asteroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; more speculatively , l ordinary chondrites could come from the gefion family @xcite , while asteroids of the the flora family bear spectral similarities with the ll chondrites @xcite .",
    "however , the parent bodies of most meteorite types , if still intact , are unknown .",
    "the discovery and spectroscopic observation of the near - earth asteroid ( nea ) 2008  tc@xmath0  ( henceforth tc@xmath0 ) 20 hours before it impacted the earth s high atmosphere , and the subsequent recovery of meteorites ( called almahata sitta )  clearly coming from this body  was a major result in this respect @xcite .",
    "it allowed a direct link between an asteroid and meteorites to be established for the first time : the asteroid was classified as belonging to the spectroscopic f - class ( in the tholen classification , * ? ? ? * ) or b - class ( in the bus classification , * ? ? ? * ) on the basis of the flat shape of its reflectance spectrum in the region between 500 and 1000 nm .",
    "moreover , among the 47 meteorites initially recovered , it was observed that the visible spectrum of the fragment @xmath3 matches the telescopic spectrum of tc@xmath0  obtained before the impact with the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "fragment @xmath3 is an achondrite polymict ureilite @xcite .",
    "ureilites are in a group of achondritic meteorits that exhibit both primitive and evolved characteristics @xcite : in particular , they are characterized by olivine and pyroxene - rich clasts among carboneous material ( mainly graphite ) ; fine - grained graphite is also present , which lower the albedo of the meteorites ( about 10 - 12% ; * ? ? ?",
    "ureilites were initially thought to derive from @xmath4-class asteroids ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , because of its spectral properties , @xcite propose a link with @xmath5-class asteroids according to the bus classification or @xmath6-class in the tholen classification .",
    "this is more plausible than a link with @xmath4-class asteroids , given the low albedos of ureilite meteorites , consistent with @xmath5 or @xmath6-class asteroids but not with the @xmath4-class .",
    "it is worth to note that the f - class can be distinguished from the b - class from a much weaker uv drop - off in the spectra of the former compared to the latter and also because b - class asteroids show a moderately higher average albedo than f - class bodies .",
    "however , in the bus classification these two classes are merged in a unique class ( the b - class ) .",
    "this is because the @xcite spectral classification is based on spectra acquired with ccd spectrographs , which  in general  do not observe far enough in the uv to observe the above - mentioned drop - off feature .",
    "we will refer in this work to b - class asteroids including both tholen b- and f - classes , and bus b - class .",
    "interestingly , mineralogical studies of almahata sitta  show that , among the @xmath7 fragments recovered @xcite , about @xmath8 are ureilites , while the remaining @xmath9 are enstatite chondrites , h and l ordinary chondrites .",
    "more specifically , @xcite show that , among a subsample of 40 deeply studied meteorites from almahata sitta , 23 fragments are achondritic ureilites and 17 have chondritic litologies with 14 of them corresponding to enstatite chondrites , 2 to h ordinary chondrites and 1 to a new type of chondrite ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "although small clasts of different types are quite common in brecciated meteorites ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) and carboneous material is found in some he d meteorites , it is the first time that meteorites of very different mineralogies ( i.e primitive fragments with achondrite polymict ureilites and evolved ones such as ordinary chondrites or enstatite chondrites ) are associated to the same fall .",
    "this led to make the hypothesis that tc@xmath0  was an asteroid made of blocks of different mineralogies , held together very loosely ( given the explosion of the body at the anomalously high altitude ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "tracing back tc@xmath0  to its source region in the asteroid main belt would allow us to understand the origin of the almahata sitta meteorites and how tc@xmath0  was put together by loosely assembling meteorites of different mineralogies .",
    "establishing this link would also be fundamental to shed light on the source region of ureilites , that albeit rare , are the forth major class of primitive meteorites recovered on earth after the cv , ci and co carbonaceous chondrites .    in their attempt to find the source region of tc@xmath0  and almahata sitta , @xcite selected all @xmath5-class asteroids , according to the bus classification , and objects of the tholen f and b classes and searched for spectra similarities with tc@xmath0  and almahata sitta . as a result of their study",
    ", they showed spectral similarities between tc@xmath0  and ungrouped asteroids as well as several dynamical asteroid groups ( or families ) as possible origins for the tc@xmath0  asteroid , namely polana ( @xmath10 au , @xmath11 ) , hoffmeister ( @xmath12 au , @xmath13 ) , pallas ( @xmath12 au , @xmath14 ) , themis ( @xmath15 au , @xmath16 ) , and theobalda ( @xmath17 au , @xmath18 ) .",
    "later , from dynamical grounds , @xcite concluded that asteroids from the inner asteroid belt ( i.e. with orbital semimajor axis @xmath19au ) are the likely parent bodies of tc@xmath0 .",
    "this reduces the choice to dispersed b - class asteroids in the inner main belt and the polana asteroid group . in section  [ section_dynamics ] , we revisit this issue studying the possible dynamical source regions for tc@xmath0 .",
    "we recall here that the polana group is part of a cluster of asteroids known as the nysa - polana family @xcite , which is located in the inner main belt , between the @xmath20 secular resonance ( at heliocentric distance @xmath21 2.1 au ) and the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter ( at heliocentric distance of 2.5 au ) .",
    "this family has a complex  twofold ",
    "structure in orbital proper element space @xcite , suggesting that it is the outcome of at least two independent break - up events in the same orbital region . from the few spectral data available at the time",
    ", @xcite argued that the nysa - polana family contains asteroids of three spectral classes .",
    "the first class is that of b - class objects , like asteroid ( 142 ) polana itself ",
    "note that @xcite uses the f - class classification from the @xcite taxonomy ; the second class is the s - class , with the largest member being identified as the asteroid ( 878 ) mildred ; the third class is that of x - class objects , such as the asteroid ( 44 ) nysa . in this manuscript",
    ", we revisit this result using a much wider dataset of spectro - photometric data provided by the moving objects catalog of the sloan digital survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is analyzed here using a new classification algorithm ( * ? ? ?",
    "* described in section [ section_method ] ) developed for the gaia space mission of the european space agency .",
    "a detailed study of the mineralogy of the nysa - polana family is of great importance also for better understanding the origin of other neos . in partcular",
    ", @xcite claimed that the asteroid ( 101955 ) 1999 rq@xmath22 , target of the sample return mission osiris - rex ( approved in the program new frontiers of nasa ) , was delivered to near - earth space via the @xmath20 secular resonance from the polana group .",
    "moreover , the binary asteroid ( 175706 ) 1996 fg@xmath0 , primary target of the sample return mission marco polo - r , under study at the european space mission ( esa ) , might have formed within the polana group and delivered to the near - earth space via the overlapping jupiter 7:2 and mars 5:9 mean motion resonances rather than the @xmath20 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as a consequence , in sections  [ section_polana ] and [ background ]",
    ", we perform a spectroscopic analysis using the sdss data of the asteroids of the nysa - polana family as well as dispersed asteroids of the inner main belt ( called objects of the background ) in order to find spectral matches with tc@xmath0  and almahata sitta .",
    "finally , in section  [ section_formation ] , we investigate a possible formation scenario for the tc@xmath0  asteroid as a rubble pile of rocks of different mineralogical types , which is based on the peculiar low inclination of the nysa - polana family and dispersed asteroids .",
    "the large majority of neas are fragments generated by the collisional disruption of larger asteroids of the main belt ; said fragments drift in orbital semimajor axis by the so - called yarkovsky effect until they reach regions of orbital instabilities ( mean motion resonances with jupiter and secular resonances ) which , by enhancing their orbital eccentricities , deliver them to the near - earth space ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "according to model by @xcite , there are five main intermediate sources of neas :    * the @xmath23 secular resonance , which marks the inner edge of the asteroid belt and occurs when the precession frequency of the longitude of perihelion of an asteroid is equal to that of saturn ; * the 3:1 mean motion resonance located at @xmath24au , where the orbital period of an asteroid is 1/3 of that of jupiter ; * mars - crossing asteroids , defined as objects which are not neas ( i.e. their perihelion distance @xmath25 is larger than 1.3 au ) , but whose semimajor axis evolves in a random - walk fashion as a result of close and distant encounters with mars . * the outer belt population , whose eccentricities can increase up to planet - crossing values due to a network of high order orbital resonances with jupiter and three - body resonance of type asteroid - jupiter - saturn @xcite * dormant jupiter family comets .",
    "the orbital elements of tc@xmath0  before impact are not known very precisely . here",
    "are different estimates : @xmath26 au , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ( neodys website : http://newton.dm.unipi.it/neodys ) ; @xmath29 au , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xcite . for each of these orbits we computed , using the original orbital evolution files of @xcite , which are the most likely intermediate sources among those enumerated above .",
    "we found that tc@xmath0  has a probability of 63 - 66% to come from the @xmath23 source and 34 - 37% to come from the mars crosser population .",
    "apparently , none of the simulations for the 3/1 resonance in @xcite produce objects within @xmath32 au in @xmath33 , @xmath32 in @xmath34 and @xmath35 in @xmath36 of tc@xmath0 .",
    "this contrasts with the claim reported in @xcite , that tc@xmath0has a 20% probability to come from the 3/1 resonance in the @xcite model .",
    "we suspect that there has been an error in the manipulation of the @xcite model in that work .    of the mars crossers that can produce the tc@xmath0  orbit in @xcite simulations , none has semimajor axis larger than 2.5 au . from this , and remembering that the @xmath23 resonance lays at the inner edge of the belt , we conclude - in agreement with @xcite - that tc@xmath0  most likely comes from the inner asteroid belt , inside of 2.5 au .",
    "as noted in @xcite , there are two populations of asteroids in the inner belt with spectra broadly consistent with that of tc@xmath0 : the polana members , with an orbital inclination of 23 degrees , and a population of dispersed b - class asteroids , with inclinations ranging up to 15 degrees .",
    "these objects are too dispersed to belong to a relatively young collisional family , but their broad cluster in orbital space suggests that they might belong to an old collisional family , dynamically dispersed probably during the phase when the orbits of the giant planets changed substantially , about 4 gyr ago .    to determine whether it is more likely that tc@xmath0  comes from the nysa - polana family or from the population of dispersed b - class asteroids , we turn , once again , to the original simulations in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the initial distribution of asteroids in the @xmath23 was uniform in inclination .",
    "in particular , 50% of the initial conditions had initial inclination larger than 8 degrees . however",
    ", 93% of the particles which reproduced the orbit of tc@xmath0  at some time during their evolution , have initial inclination @xmath2 . for the mars crossers , all those reproducing the orbit of tc@xmath0  have initial @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the most likely source of tc@xmath0  is at low inclination , consistent with the nysa - polana family and with the dispersed b - class asteroids with @xmath2 .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the inclination of tc@xmath0  is 2.32.5 degrees .",
    "however , the dynamics rules out a tc@xmath0  origin from the dispersed b - class asteroids at higher inclination ( i.e. i@xmath37 ) .",
    "finally , @xcite have shown that the polana group can easily deliver small enough fragments in the @xmath20 resonance .",
    "in fact , the extrapolated yarkovsky - induced semimajor axis distribution of polana group members predicts that asteroids fainter than @xmath38 18.5 can reach the border of the @xmath20 resonance , which is at 2.15 au for a polana - like inclination . assuming a polana - like geometric visible albedo of 0.05",
    ", @xmath39 18.5 translates into a diameter @xmath40 2 km , which is much larger then the size of tc@xmath0 .",
    "for all these reasons we conclude that , from the dynamical viewpoint , the nysa - polana family and dispersed b - class asteroids with @xmath2 are the most likely sources of tc@xmath0 .",
    "thus , we will focus on the nysa - polana family and the background at low inclination in the next sections .",
    "in order to search for spectral groups in the nysa - polana asteroid family or in the inner main belt background at low inclination , we used the unsupervised classification algorithm that will be adopted for the classification of asteroid spectra from the multiband photometers @xcite on board the gaia space mission of the european space agency ( esa ) .",
    "while gaia is mainly devoted to the observations of @xmath41 stars , it is expected that this mission will also observe more than 250,000 asteroids multiple times over 5 years ( mission lifetime ) @xcite .",
    "spectral classification of asteroids will be performed by an unsupervised classification algorithm based on the works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an unsupervised approach has the advantage that no _ a priori _ information is taken into account to build the spectral groups .",
    "the algorithm is based on a method for partitioning a set @xmath42 of @xmath43 data points ( @xmath44 ) where @xmath45 in our case is the number of spectral bands into @xmath46 non - overlapping clusters ( or groups of data points ) such that ( a ) the inter - cluster variance is maximized and ( b ) the intra - cluster variance is minimized .",
    "each spectrum is considered as a vertex of tree .",
    "a tree is a graph that is connected ( i.e. every vertex is connected to at least another vertex ) and acyclic ( i.e. the graph has no loops ) .",
    "the spanning tree ( mst , i.e. the tree passing through each vertex of the set ) with the minimal length is calculated using the so - called prim s algorithm ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the length of each edge of the tree ( i.e. the distance between two spectra ) is determined using the kullback - leibler metric : let @xmath47 the feature vector corresponding to a reflectance spectrum ( @xmath45 being the number of wavelengths ) ; at a given wavelength @xmath48 , each spectrum is associated with a ( positive ) normalized quantity : @xmath49 , which can be interpreted as the probability distribution that a certain amount of information has been measured around the wavelength @xmath50 . to measure the similarity between two probability density functions , we compute the symmetrized kullback - leibler divergence : @xmath51 the identification of the cluster",
    "is performed by first computing , at each step of the mst construction , the length of the newly connected edge and then by identifying valleys in the curve obtained by plotting the mst edge length as a function of the iteration of the construction ( see figure [ fig : mst ] ) .",
    "the valleys in this curve identify the number and the position of high density region of points , i.e. the clusters ( see * ? ? ? * for a more thorough description of the algorithm ) .      in order to increase the sample statistics compared to the relatively small number of asteroids observed by @xcite and identify meaningful spectral groups within the nysa - polana family , we used our spectral classification algorithm on the observations contained in the sdss moc4 ( * ? ? ? * http://www.sdss.org ) .",
    "the moc4 contains magnitudes of 104449 main belt asteroids .",
    "each asteroid was observed , in general , at multiple epochs over 5 spectral bands in the visible light , namely @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 at the following central wavelengths ( @xmath50 ) of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 nm , respectively .    to obtain the surface reflectance of the asteroids , we needed to remove the solar contribution ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) to the observed magnitudes .",

    ". finally , we obtained the following asteroid reflectance for the @xmath74 wavelength : @xmath75 @xmath76 the reflectance colors at @xmath74 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "the same computations were performed for the @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 wavelengths .",
    "we searched in the moc4 database for all asteroids belonging to the nysa - polana family and for dispersed objects .",
    "concerning the family members identification , we used the definition of dynamical families of @xcite . among the nysa - polana family ,",
    "4134 objects have been observed at least once by sdss ( as a comparison , the number of spectra obtained in the visible light or near - infra red , for the nysa - polana family , in the smass , ecas and 52-color catalogs are : 15 , 13 , and 2 , respectively ) . for those asteroids with more than one observation , we calculated the weighted mean reflectance by averaging the reflectancies derived at each epoch weighing each point with its respective signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "however , likely due to non - photometric conditions some of the observed objects have high uncertainties in the measured magnitudes . in the visible light",

    "it is important to note that this spectral match was obtained only considering the visible wavelengths between about 350 and 900 nm .",

    "an important caveat is that the link between b - class asteroids and the almahata sitta  ureilites proposed by @xcite is based on the noisy spectrum of tc@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , b - class asteroids are more commonly associated with carbonaceous chondrites by several studies ( see * ? ? ? * for a review about b - class objects , their meteorite analogues and their composition ) . however , a recent spectroscopic survey of b - class asteroids by @xcite shows that the ensemble of the reflectance spectra of the 45 b - class asteroids analyzed in their work have a continuous shape variation in the range between 500 and 2500 nm , from a monotonic negative ( blue ) slope to a positive ( red ) slope . @xcite apply a clustering technique to reduce the ensemble of the spectra to 6 optimized averaged spectra or `` groups '' .",

    "one possible explanation for this spectral mismatch is the space weathering of s - class asteroids .",
    "we discuss this possibility in the following subsection .",
    "space weathering is a physical process caused by cosmic rays , collisions , ion bombardment , that alters physical and spectral properties of the surface of atmosphere - less planetary bodies .",
    "more particularly , due to space weathering , s - class asteroids become darker ( their albedo is reduced ) , redder ( the reflectance increases with increasing wavelength ) , and the depth of absorption bands are reduced . as a consequence , the spectral slope changes due to this process @xcite .    in @xcite , a strong relation was found between the spectral slope of s - class asteroids and their `` exposure '' to space weathering .",
    "the exposure of an asteroid to space weathering corresponds to time integral the flux of solar ions that the body receives along its orbit .",
    "the exposure to space weathering depends on the age of the asteroid and its average distance from the sun .",
    "therefore , in order to know if space weathering affected s - class asteroids of the nysa - polana family , we calculate the exposure to space weathering of these bodies as shown in @xcite and @xcite .    .",

    "to calculate the exposure , we need to estimate the average collisional age of main belt asteroids ( @xmath108 ) , which can be constrained by the age of the belt ( @xmath109 gyr ) and by collisional times ( @xmath110 ) : @xmath111 + t_{lhb}\\,e^{-\\frac{t_{lhb}}{\\tau_{coll}}}\\ ] ] according to @xcite , the collisional lifetime can be estimated as a function of asteroid diameter ( using sdss h absolute magnitudes and assuming an albedo of @xmath112 for all s - class objects ) . in the end , we have : @xmath113 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the asteroid proper semimajor axis and eccentricity , respectively .    in figure",

    "the exposure variation mainly comes from asteroid diameter , through the computation of @xmath108 .",
    "hence , plotting the spectral slope as a function of the exposure , or @xmath108 , or asteroid diameters ( @xmath115 ) provide quite similar figures ( not shown here )  where the exposure increases with time or diameter  but with the following abscissa ranges : @xmath116 gyr or @xmath117 km .",
    "the spectral slope increase with exposure or asteroid age is then the proof that space weathering occurs for s - class asteroids of the nysa - polana family .",
    "we also note that the spectral slope of the fragment @xmath85 of almahata sitta  has the value of @xmath118 .    as a consequence , the spectral mismatch between asteroids of the s - component of the nysa - polana family and the ordinary chondrites of almahata sitta   as observed in figure [ fig : spectra ] ",
    "can be explained by space weathering .",
    "as mentioned in sections [ section_intro ] and [ section_dynamics ] , the other possible origin source for tc@xmath0 , from a dynamical point of view , is the population of dispersed asteroids at low inclination . in the present section ,",
    "we perform the same spectroscopic study as for the nysa - polana family ( section [ section_polana ] ) but using objects of the background located in the inner main belt ( @xmath119 au ) with a proper inclination lower than @xmath120 . selecting the best observations of the sdss moc4 catalog ( i.e. observations with a relative uncertainty @xmath81 on the in - band photometric flux , corresponding to 2828 objects ) , we find 4 large groups of asteroids corresponding to the following spectral classes : b , c , x , s , as well as small clusters of q , v , and a - class asteroids .",
    "in addition , for the b , x , and s groups of the background , we obtain mean spectra very similar to those of the nysa - polana family ( not shown here ) .",
    "we also note that space weathering is also found for s - class asteroids of the background ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spaceweathering ] ) . as a consequence , the three ingredients required to form tc@xmath0  ( s - class asteroid / h - chondrite ; b - class asteroid / ureilite ; x - class asteroid / enstatite chondrite ) are both found in the nysa - polana family and in the background at low inclination .    in our attempt to definitively conclude on the origin region of tc@xmath0 , we have compared the distribution of b - class asteroids for the two source regions . in order to get a homogeneous selection of b - class asteroids both from the nysa - polana family and the background at low inclination , we have selected objects such as their spectra are similar to the b - class mean spectrum of the nysa - polana family , within the 1-@xmath92 error bar .",
    "although this selection reduces the size of the original b - class groups , we limit the overlap of classes ( b and x classes can overlap ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .    from this selection ,",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] , the cumulative number of asteroids as a function of @xmath121 absolute magnitude as well as the distribution in eccentricity , inclination and @xmath121 magnitude as a function of semimajor axis .",
    "we find more b - class asteroids from the background at low inclination ( dashed curve in the first plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] ) than from the polana group ( black curve ) . as a consequence",
    ", the background at low inclination seems to dominate the polana group , even if , around magnitude 17 , the slope of the polana group curve looks a little steeper than the curve for the background . in the other plots in orbital elements",
    ", we can see that the two regions overlap in some points and that b - class objects of the background are much more dispersed compared to polana asteroids .    as in @xcite",
    ", we also represent the absolute magnitude @xmath122 a a function of semimajor axis , both for the polana group and the background ( the plot of * ? ? ?",
    "* was done for the whole nysa - polana family ) .",
    "the plot appears to be v - shaped which is a feature known to be associated both with the size - dependent ejection velocity field and with the drift in the proper semimajor axis induced by the yarkovsky effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the plot ,",
    "the black curve shows the @xmath121-dependent semimajor axis distribution induced by the yarkovsky effect that best fits the boundaries of the observed distribution for the polana b - class asteroids .",
    "objects below this curve are expected to be interlopers and may belong to the background .",
    "the extrapolated yarkovsky - induced distribution predicts that the polana group should reach the outer edge of the @xmath20 resonance for objects with @xmath123 , which for a polana - like albedo of @xmath124 translates into a diameter @xmath125 km .",
    "this means that objects smaller than @xmath126 km , such as tc@xmath0 , can easily escape the polana group and the inner main belt .    concerning the background at low inclination",
    ", different size limits can be computed due to a large variation of proper orbital inclinations . for an inclination of @xmath127 ,",
    "the @xmath20 resonance boundary is found at @xmath128 au , which gives us an @xmath121 magnitude of @xmath129 and an asteroid diameter limit of @xmath130 km .",
    "for the highest inclination ( @xmath131 ) , we obtain @xmath132 at @xmath133 au , which is equivalent to a b - class asteroid ( @xmath134 ) of 8 km . as a result",
    ", the background at low inclination could have also delivered tc@xmath0  through the @xmath20 resonance .    because the background at low inclination is not a dynamical family , its v - shaped structure in @xmath135 was not especially expected .",
    "we then think that the background at low inclination could correspond to an old break - up of the nysa - polana family . as a consequence",
    ", we can conclude that tc@xmath0  comes from the inner main belt , more particularly from the background at low inclination or the nysa - polana family , and that these two sources could be genetically linked .",
    "meteorite strewn fields with fragments of different mineralogical types are very rare .",
    "almahata sitta and kaidun @xcite are probably the only known specimen . in the scenario",
    "that mixing occurs by a collisional process , the paucity of mineralogically - mixed meteorites suggests that the process that formed almahata sitta",
    "i.e. mixing the material between projectile and target is very rare ; in most cases the projectile is pulverized and leaves negligible traces in the target @xcite .",
    "it is unclear which conditions allow for mixing between projectile and target .",
    "impact velocity is probably a key parameter .",
    "the average impact velocity between asteroids in the main belt is 4.4 - 5.3 km / s @xcite . if projectile / target mixing were possible at these impact speeds , meteorites like almahata sitta would probably be frequent , which is not the case",
    "thus , we think that unusually low impact velocities are needed for mixing .",
    "this could prevent the target from pulverizing and could lead to macroscopic projectile fragments being implanted in the regolith of the impacted body or gravitationally bound to fragments of the target , if the latter is catastrophically disrupted by the impact .",
    "the fact that we give evidence that tc@xmath0  comes from the nysa - polana family ( see section [ section_polana ] ) or the background at low inclination ( see section [ background ] ) , which are characterized by a mixing a taxonomic classes , also suggests that a specificity of the members of these families / regions may be unusually low collision velocities with projectiles that are also on low - inclination orbits .",
    "for all these reasons we did a systematic search for projectiles that could hit nysa - polana family members or dispersed asteroids of the background at very low speeds .",
    "we did this search using the algorithm for the calculation of the intrinsic collision probability @xmath136 between pairs of asteroids , described in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm , given the semimajor axis @xmath33 , eccentricity @xmath34 and inclination @xmath36 of the two orbits ( we use proper values for each pair of selected asteroids ) assumes that the angles @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 ( mean anomaly , argument of perihelion and longitude of the ascending node ) of the two objects have a uniform probability distribution over the range @xmath140 ; then it computes which fraction of these angles corresponds to the two objects being closer to each other than 1 km ; finally , this fraction is translated into an intrinsic collision probability per year ( @xmath136 ) , using the orbital periods of the two objects and assuming that they are not in resonance with each other . for our goals , we modified this algorithm in order to take into account only orbital intersections corresponding to relative speeds smaller than @xmath141 km / s .",
    "admittedly , this velocity threshold is arbitrary . given the exceptional character of almahata sitta , we need a threshold much smaller than the typical impact velocity among random asteroids , that is to say a sub - sonic impact velocity , in order to preserve the target .    because most of almahata sitta fragments recovered are mainly made of ureilites , which we consider as analogs of b - class asteroids ( as previously mentioned in section [ section_intro ] and according to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we assume that the favorite scenario for the formation of tc@xmath0  involves a low velocity collision of asteroids of x and s classes ( projectiles ) with a b - class member ( target ) of the nysa - polana family .     and @xmath90 , with @xmath142 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 corresponding to sdss magnitudes at the following central wavelengths : 477 nm , 623 nm , 763 nm and 913 nm , respectively .",
    "bluer dots ( @xmath143 $ ] and @xmath144 $ ] ) are related to dark objects while yellow to red colors ( @xmath145 $ ] and @xmath146 $ ] ) gather brighter objects ( see figure [ fig : astariz ] for more details ) .",
    "data come from the sdss moving objects catalog 4.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   and @xmath90 , with @xmath142 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 corresponding to sdss magnitudes at the following central wavelengths : 477 nm , 623 nm , 763 nm and 913 nm , respectively .",

    "data come from the sdss moving objects catalog 4.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as for projectiles we considered all asteroids known in the astorb file ( asteroid orbital elements database : ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.html ) of the whole main belt and we computed the probability of collision of each asteroid with a b - class object near the center of the b - class group of the nysa - polana family .",
    "figure [ fig : collision ] shows the region of orbital element space where impacts can occur ( impact probability @xmath1470 ) .",
    "this figure shows that asteroids included in the region of low - velocity impacts have different sdss colors and thus different taxonomies . as a consequence ,",
    "collisions involving b - class , s - class , and x - class asteroids are likely to be possible .    in the end , depending on the location of the target within the polana group , we find that projectiles come from one of the following families : ( i ) nysa - polana , ( ii ) flora or ( iii ) massalia , located in the inner main belt , or ( iv ) hestia which is in the central main belt , very close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter .",
    "more particularly , for targets with a semimajor axis ( @xmath33 ) smaller or equal than @xmath148 au , the flora family and objects of the background , very close to the flora and nysa - polana family are the main source of projectiles ; for targets with 2.3 @xmath149 2.4 au and eccentricities larger than @xmath1500.15 , projectiles in general are likely to come from the nysa - polana family ; for targets with 2.3 @xmath149 2.4 au and eccentricities smaller than @xmath151 0.15 , projectiles are likely to come from the massalia family ; for targets with @xmath152 2.4 au projectiles come from the hestia family .",
    "similar results are found when studying collisions involving b - class asteroids of the background at low inclination .",
    "once identified the region of potential impactors , we proceded to estimate the likelihood and the frequency of impacts , which depend on the sizes , number density of asteroids , and average impact probability in the region .",
    "the average impact probability in the region was derived by averaging the intrinsic impact probabilities ( one of the output of our algorithm ) of the asteroids in the region ; we found @xmath153 impacts / km@xmath154/year .",
    "first of all , we estimated the number of impacts and the size of the impactors hitting tc@xmath0  during its collisional lifetime assuming a diameter of 4 m ( given by its h value of 30.9 @xcite and assuming a geometric visible albedo of 0.05 ) .",
    "the impact probability per projectile for tc@xmath0  is given by @xmath155 with @xmath156 the radius of tc@xmath0  and @xmath110 its collisional lifetime estimated from @xcite ( @xmath157 myr ) .",
    "as a consequence , we find that tc@xmath0  has an impact probability per projectile of the order of @xmath158 during its collisional lifetime .    to obtain the number of impacts on tc@xmath0  during its collisional lifetime , we estimated the number of projectiles by calculating the size frequency distribution ( sfd ) of the population of the asteroids in the impact region and extrapolating the corresponding function to asteroid sizes below the detection limit of current discovery surveys . figure  [ fig : sfd ] shows the sfd in terms of the cumulative number of asteroid as function of their absolute magnitude ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "we used @xmath121 values from the astorb file . in order to extrapolate the sfd asteroid sizes below the current detection limits",
    ", we calculated the equation of the straight line that best fits the base-10 logarithm of the known sfd and that is compatible with the size frequency distribution of the whole main belt ( see * ? ? ? * ) ( see figure  [ fig : sfd ] ) .",
    "the line has equation @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the @xmath161 10-base logarithm of the cumulative number of asteroids with @xmath121 smaller or equal than a threshold value .",
    "the best - fit value for @xmath105 and @xmath162 are @xmath141 and -4.5 respectively , implying about @xmath163 asteroids with @xmath164 , @xmath165 objects with @xmath166 , @xmath41 with @xmath167 and @xmath168 with @xmath169 , if the linear extrapolation is assumed to be valid .",
    "we can deduce that for @xmath169 , we obtain only @xmath170 impacts with tc@xmath0 . in the end , 1 impact at v @xmath171 0.5 km / s during tc@xmath0collisional lifetime would require @xmath172 objects ( i.e. @xmath173 objects ) .",
    "using the sfd equation , this means we need a collision with an object of magnitude @xmath174 .",
    "this correspond to the size of a pebble of 2.4 cm of diameter .",
    "clearly the contamination brought by low speed impacts is very small ( the volume ratio between tc@xmath0  and the pebble is 1.1@xmath175 ) and certainly not at the level of 20 - 30% as implied by the number of chondrites found amongst the ureilites of the almahata sitta  meteorites .",
    "much more likely , tc@xmath0  was a fragment of a larger asteroid that was liberated by an impact near the @xmath20 resonance few millions years ago .",
    "in fact , we note that ( 1 ) the dynamical time to deliver asteroids from the @xmath20 resonance to orbits similar to that of tc@xmath0  is of the order of 19 myr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for 1999 @xmath176 coming from the polana region ) ; ( 2 ) the cosmic ray exposure age of almahata sitta  meteorites is of 19.5@xmath1772.5 myr @xcite ; as a consequence , tc@xmath0  spent most of its life as a single asteroid traveling from the @xmath20 resonance to the orbit that brought it to impact the earth .",
    "it makes sense to investigate what was the contamination brought by low velocity impacts on the parent body of tc@xmath0 .",
    "the average impact probability implies that we have @xmath151 @xmath178@xmath179 impacts / km@xmath154 over the age of the solar system , which correspond to 1 impact of an asteroid of @xmath180 taking into account the sfd of the objects in the region .",
    "the diameter of an asteroid with h=27 is between 10 and 25 m depending on the albedo . again",
    "the level of contamination is very little , of the order of 1.@xmath181 .",
    "when we take into account the necessity of mixing meteorites of at least three different mineralogies , we conclude that the formation of tc@xmath0  by means of low - velocity collisions is not a realistic scenario .",
    "from our study , it seems that the nysa - polana family and the background at low inclination are good candidates for the origin of 2008  tc@xmath0  and almahata sitta .",
    "first of all , as mentioned in section [ section_dynamics ] , the nysa - polana family is located close to the @xmath20 secular resonance which is the favorite route leading to primitive neos and more particularly to asteroid 2008  tc@xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the proper inclination of the nysa - polana family is very similar to that of tc@xmath0 , which should have been maintained during the transfer of tc@xmath0to the neos region through the @xmath20 secular resonance .",
    "we also know , from our algorithm of spectral classification ( section [ section_method ] ) , that the nysa - polana family gathers the 3 spectral classes ( s , b , and x ) , which are proposed analogs to almahata sittafragments ( section [ section_polana ] ) under the hypothesis that ureilites are linked to b - class asteroids .",
    "more specifically , ( 1 ) the mean spectrum of b - class asteroids of the nysa - polana family is spectrally matched  at least in the visible  with available spectra of ureilitic fragments of almahata sitta , ( 2 ) considering space - weathering effects , the mean spectrum of s - class asteroids of the nysa - polana family is compatible with the spectrum of the h - chondrite fragment @xmath85 , ( 3 ) a good agreement is found between x - class asteroids and enstatite chondrites from other meteorite falls ( we remind that enstatite chondrites are part of almahata sitta ) .",
    "of course , a comparison with enstatite chondrites from almahata sitta  fragments would be very useful to get a definitive match between the nysa - polana family and almahata sitta . in section [ background ] , the same kind of work was performed for objects of the inner main belt coming from the background at low inclination ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we concluded that these dispersed asteroids could also be at the origin of tc@xmath0 .    in section [ section_formation ]",
    ", we tried to explain the formation of tc@xmath0  by low velocity impacts ( below @xmath141 km / s ) between different mineralogies in the neighborhood of and within the nysa - polana family . selecting tc@xmath0  as the target asteroid ( d=4 m ) , we find a probability per projectile about @xmath182 impacts during its collisional lifetime ( i.e. in 16.2 myr ) .",
    "as a consequence , impacts at low velocity are extremely rare and there is little chance that tc3 was formed by low - velocity impacts in the current asteroid belt .",
    "this implies that the heterogeneous composition of the parent body of tc@xmath0has to be inherited from a time when the asteroid belt was in a different dynamical state , most likely in the very early solar system .",
    "one could think that an asteroid of ureilite composition was contaminated by impactors of different nature when the asteroid belt was still massive and dynamically cold , so that mutual collisions were frequent and at low velocity . however , this view is probably simplistic .",
    "in fact , a body of ureilite composition needs to be formed in the interior of a large carbonaceous asteroid which underwent significant thermal alteration @xcite .",
    "this asteroid needs to have undergone a collisional disruption to expose the ureilite material in space .",
    "the same is true for the bodies of hn composition , with n larger than 3 @xcite .",
    "but collisional disruptions require large relative velocities , in contrast with the view of a dynamically cold belt .",
    "thus , the asteroid belt could not be overall dynamically cold when the parent body of tc@xmath0  formed .",
    "these considerations suggest that , conversely to what is usually thought , accretion and collisional erosion had to co - exist for some time in the asteroid belt . for this to be possible",
    ", presumably there had to be still a significant amount of gas in the system so that , although large asteroids could be on dynamically excited orbits , the orbit of their small fragments were rapidly re - circularized by gas - drag .",
    "consequently , the mutual relative velocities of these fragments were small and a new phase of accretion was possible for them .",
    "we remark that the heterogeneity of tc@xmath0  is not at the microscopic level ; each of the meteorites delivered to the ground are of a distinct class .",
    "thus , tc@xmath0  seems to be an agglomeration of meteorite - sized ( i.e. few dm ) pebbles of different nature .",
    "pebbles of this size are strongly coupled with the gas and are extremely sensitive to pressure gradients .",
    "they play the key role in the new models of planetesimal formations , based on the concentration of dm - size pebbles in the eddies of a turbulent disk and on the process of streaming instability @xcite",
    ". these models of planetesimal formation in a turbulent disk seem a priori to be particularly favorable to explain the coexistence of collisional erosion and accretion .",
    "large planetesimals are formed by the concentration of a large number of pebbles , forming self - gravitating clumps .",
    "once formed , the orbits of these large planetesimals are rapidly excited by the stochastic gravitational perturbations exerted by the turbulent disk @xcite . if the threshold for collisional break - up is achieved , the pebble - size fragments of these large bodies are re - injected into the game : by being concentrated into new eddies they can give origin to new large planetesimals and so forth .",
    "admittedly , quantitative work is needed to support this scenario ; also , other more classical planetesimal formation mechanism in presence of gas drag @xcite might explain the coexistence of erosion and accretion as well .    in this respect , it will be important to understand from the observational point of view if macroscopic heterogeneity as that of tc@xmath0  is the exception or the rule among asteroids .",
    "tc@xmath0  is the first object of this kind that has ever been observed , but it is also the first fall of an asteroid on earth documented live and for which an extensive and exhaustive search for meteorites has been done .",
    "so , it might not be as rare as one could be tempted to believe .",
    "indeed , a second similar case has just been reported @xcite .",
    "now that the possibility for macroscopic heterogeneity is recognized , careful investigations ( also conducted by remote sensing techniques ) may reveal additional interesting cases . understanding which fraction of the asteroids are of primary or secondary accretion will be a fundamental step to constrain the asteroid formation and evolution models .",
