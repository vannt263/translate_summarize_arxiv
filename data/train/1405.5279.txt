    "lewis @xcite gave us ( page 124 ) an alternative formulation for the cpr rule with a simpler rule and an axiom schema : @xmath342 that rule is a derived rule in ipuc as we can see by the derivation below , using lemma 59 of @xcite ( proof @xmath112 ) :    inside ipuc - logic , the axioms @xmath343 are unnecessary to recover the completeness of the v - logic , because they are derived formulas in the presence of connex :    so , in order to recover the full v - logic expressivity , we need to introduce some rules into the ipuc - logic .",
    "the first approach is a rule , motivated by @xcite , with two restrictions : ( a ) the formulas fit into their contexts ; ( b ) @xmath27 has no universal quantifier . and",
    "the connex axioms became theorems :    given any model @xmath84 , the set of testimonials of @xmath100 is the set of neighbourhoods @xmath344 and the set of believers of @xmath100 is the set of neighbourhoods @xmath345 .",
    "@xmath346 is an hereditary set @xcite in @xmath347 , because given any neighbourhood @xmath348 , for every @xmath349 , such that @xmath350 , then @xmath351 and , by world existential propagation , @xmath352 and @xmath353 .",

    "but the rule depends on the index of two formulas , the operator @xmath57 and the scope of the rule and it makes this rule two much complex .",
    "so , instead of adding rule 31 into ipuc - logic , we prefer to add the representation of the hereditary sets into the system",
    ". we can also treat the hereditary sets of believers to recover some symmetry between the world quantifiers , because we have , by a similar argument , @xmath360 .",
