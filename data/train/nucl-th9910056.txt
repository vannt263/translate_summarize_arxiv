    "cooper s theorem @xcite implies that if there is an attractive interaction in a cold fermi sea , the system is unstable with respect to formation of a particle - particle condensate . in qcd , single - gluon exchange between quarks of different color generates an attractive interaction in the color - antitriplet channel @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears unavoidable that color superconductivity occurs in dense quark matter which is sufficiently cold @xcite .",
    "how a dense quark phase matches onto hadronic matter is difficult to address @xcite . in particular , while a quark - quark condensate may form , such condensation competes with the tendency of a quark - quark pair to bind with a third quark , to form a color - singlet hadron .",
    "one way of understanding color superconductivity is to compute at very high densities , where by asymptotic freedom , perturbation theory can be used . at nonzero temperature , but zero quark density , it is well known that perturbation theory is a particularly bad approximation @xcite .",
    "if @xmath4 is the coupling constant for qcd , the free energy is not an expansion in @xmath5 , but only in @xmath4 , with a series which is well behaved only for @xmath6 . in contrast , at zero temperature and nonzero quark density , the free energy is an expansion in @xmath7 , and appears to be well behaved for much larger values of the coupling constant , up to values of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached by comparing the gluon `` mass '' , @xmath9 or @xmath10 to the chemical potential , @xmath11 , or the temperature , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "thus for cold , dense quark matter , perturbation theory might give us information which not even lattice qcd calculations can provide .",
    "color superconductivity is rather different from ordinary superconductivity , as in the model of bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite . in bcs - like theories ,",
    "superconductivity is determined by infrared divergences which arise in the scattering between two fermions close to the fermi surface : the initial fermions , with momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 , scatter into a pair with momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "summing up bubble diagrams generates an instability which is only cured by a fermion - fermion condensate .",
    "if the fermions interact through a point - like four - fermion coupling , though , there is no correlation between the initial and outgoing momenta , @xmath13 and @xmath15 . in the gap equation",
    ", this implies that the gap function is constant with respect to momentum , as long as the momenta are near the fermi surface .    in qcd ,",
    "however , scattering through single - gluon exchange strongly correlates the direction of the in- and out - going quarks : there is a logarithmic divergence for forward - angle scattering , @xmath17 .",
    "this extra logarithm from forward - scattering implies that the gap is not an exponential in @xmath18 , as in bcs - like theories , but only in @xmath19 @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the gap function is no longer constant as a function of momentum , even about the fermi surface .",
    "the logarithmic divergence for forward - angle scattering arises because in cold , dense quark matter , static , magnetic interactions are not screened through a `` magnetic mass '' .",
    "this is very different from a system of hot quarks and gluons . over large distances ,",
    "a hot system is essentially three - dimensional ; gluons in three dimensions have power - like infrared divergences , which screen static , magnetic fluctuations through a magnetic mass @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast , loop corrections in cold , dense quark matter are essentially four - dimensional ; infrared divergences are at worst logarithmic , so that any magnetic mass is at best @xmath21 , which is much smaller than the scale for color superconductivity , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the zero - temperature color - superconducting spin - zero condensate @xmath23 on the qcd coupling constant @xmath4 was first computed by son @xcite , who used a beautiful renormalization - group analysis to show that @xmath24 here @xmath25 arises naturally from the solution , assuming three colors . in son",
    "s result , @xmath26 is a pure number of order one .    in this paper",
    "we derive the gap equations for a condensate with total spin @xmath0 and @xmath27 massless quark flavors , at an arbitrary temperature @xmath12 .",
    "our derivation is perturbative , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath28 . in this case",
    "there are three scales in cold , dense qcd , the chemical potential @xmath11 , the gluon mass @xmath9 , and the color - superconducting condensate @xmath29 , and they are naturally ordered , @xmath30 .",
    "we solve the gap equations to `` leading logarithmic accuracy '' , by which we mean the following . in the gap equations , the leading terms are @xmath31 .",
    "these terms generate the exponential in @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eqphi0 ] ) , therefore @xmath32 is of order @xmath19 .",
    "there are also leading logarithmic terms @xmath33 , which are @xmath34 plus a constant .",
    "the @xmath35 gives rise to the prefactor @xmath36 , while the constant contributes to @xmath37 .",
    "for @xmath38 flavors of massless quarks we find @xmath39 there are other terms in the gap equations , which do not arise from @xmath40 .",
    "these terms are of order one , and thus of the same order as the constant term originating from the logarithm @xmath40 .",
    "hence they contribute in the same way to @xmath37 .",
    "we do not compute these , so that in ( [ b0 ] ) there is an undetermined constant @xmath41 .",
    "our results were described previously @xcite , and agree completely with an independent analysis by schfer and wilczek @xcite ; they also overlap with those of hong _ et al .",
    "the factor @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ b0 ] ) originates from the @xmath38 dependence of @xmath43 ; however , @xmath41 will also depend on @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "even though we do not determine @xmath41 , it is very interesting that the numerical value of @xmath44 is large .",
    "this implies that , for chemical potentials of order @xmath45 gev , the gap can be of order @xmath46 mev @xcite .",
    "such large values of the gap are in accord with previous estimates obtained within nambu  jona - lasinio models @xcite , and are much larger than original estimates by bailin and love , @xmath47 mev @xcite .",
    "we then solve the gap equations at nonzero temperature .",
    "we find a surprising result : while the detailed form of the gap function is very different in qcd versus bcs - like theories , the temperature dependence of the condensate  the dimensionless ratio of the condensate at a temperature @xmath12 to that at zero temperature , @xmath48 , is _ identical _ to bcs - type theories . in particular , the ratio of the critical temperature , @xmath49 , is as in bcs @xcite .",
    "our result for @xmath48 is valid to leading order in weak coupling , even though we can not compute the overall magnitude of @xmath23 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath41 . in our mean - field approximation",
    "the transition is of second order , but the transition can be driven first order by critical fluctuations near the would - be critical point @xcite .",
    "we then classify the condensates with total spin @xmath1 .",
    "following our classification of condensates with @xmath0 , which employed projectors for chirality , helicity , and energy , we show that there are two types of spin - one condensates , longitudinal and transverse . as an example",
    ", we solve the gap equations for @xmath50 and find @xmath51 that is , not only is the parametric dependence of the spin - one condensates on @xmath4 the same as for spin zero , as argued originally by son @xcite , but to leading logarithmic accuracy , even the constant in front is the same .",
    "we do not expect that @xmath52 , the undetermined constant analogous to @xmath41 , is the same .",
    "surely @xmath52 is smaller than @xmath41 , and depends on whether the condensate is longitudinal or transverse .",
    "this is very different from bcs - like theories , where condensates with higher spin are typically exponentially suppressed . in qcd ,",
    "higher - spin condensates are only suppressed by a pure number .",
    "nevertheless , one dramatic implication of our results is that superconductivity in qcd may be very unlike one s intuition from non - relativistic systems . instead of higher - spin gaps being much smaller",
    ", they may be relatively large , which is important for phenomenology .",
    "consider , for instance , a quark star with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 quarks . in the limit of high densities , when the strange quark mass @xmath56 is negligible , the number of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 quarks are equal .",
    "then charge neutrality is automatic , and the preferred color - superconducting condensates are of spin @xmath0 , with color - flavor locking @xcite .",
    "for realistic densities , however , the chemical potentials for @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 will not be equal .",
    "the strange quark chemical potential differs from the up and down quark chemical potentials due to @xmath57 .",
    "the up and down quark chemical potentials differ on account of charge neutrality .",
    "these effects suppress the color - antitriplet @xmath0 condensates , because they are composed of quarks with different flavor . on the other hand",
    ", the color - antitriplet @xmath1 condensates may form between quarks of the same flavor , and are not suppressed if the chemical potentials of the various flavors differ .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ ii ] , we derive the gap equations for a spin @xmath0 condensate of @xmath58 massless flavors at an arbitrary temperature @xmath12 . in section [ iii ] we solve these equations to leading logarithmic accuracy , first at @xmath59 , and then at nonzero @xmath12 . in section [ j1 ]",
    "we classify the possible spin @xmath1 condensates , and solve the gap equations for @xmath60 .",

    "a color - antitriplet condensate is a flavor singlet , @xmath71 by a global color rotation , we can always choose @xmath72 to point in 3direction in color space , @xmath73 . for @xmath74 ,",
    "even if we assume that the dominant condensate is a color antitriplet , there is always a small admixture of a color sextet @xcite .",
    "the color - antitriplet condensate is a flavor antitriplet , and the color sextet a flavor sextet @xcite . in this paper , for simplicity we consider only the case @xmath27 .    the gap equation for a color - superconducting condensate of massless fermions was derived in @xcite [ cf .",

    "we analyze the flavor , color , and dirac structure of the gap equation ( [ gapeq ] ) . for @xmath58 , the color - flavor structure of the condensate ( [ cond ] )",
    "does not mix color and flavor indices , and thus the analysis of flavor and color can be done separately .",
    "this is different for @xmath74 , where color rotations are locked to flavor rotations .",
    "we first discuss the flavor structure of eq .",
    "( [ gapeq ] ) .",
    "fundamental color indices will be suppressed for the moment .",
    "the free propagator ( [ freeprop ] ) is diagonal in flavor , @xmath91 so is the self energy , @xmath92 and thus @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , both the left- and right - hand sides of ( [ gapeq ] ) are simply proportional to @xmath94 : the flavor structure of the gap equation is trivial in qcd with @xmath27 flavors , and will thus not be explicitly denoted in the following .",
    "the free propagator ( [ freeprop ] ) is diagonal in the color indices for the fundamental representation , @xmath95 the self energy @xmath96 is also diagonal , but not all diagonal elements are equal : @xmath97  the self energy for quarks with color 3 vanishes  ! this is easy to understand .",
    "let us first note that , according to eq .",
    "( a17 ) of @xcite , the condensate @xmath98 is actually proportional to @xmath99 , while @xmath100 .",

    "( [ selfenergy ] ) , the self energy @xmath102 arises from the following process : a quark with , let s say , color 1 annihilates with a corresponding antiquark in @xmath98 , creating a charge - conjugate quark with color 2 .",
    "this quark is propagated with the charge - conjugate propagator @xmath103 , and annihilates with a charge - conjugate antiquark of color 2 in @xmath104 , whereby a quark with color 1 is emitted .",
    "as only quarks with colors 1 and 2 condense , it is not possible to annihilate and create quarks with color 3 in this process ; thus the latter do not attain a self energy .",

    "taylor identities would also generate similar corrections for the gluon , and for the quark - quark - gluon vertex .",

    "( iii ) effects of the condensate : * + we have computed the gap using an hdl - resummed gluon propagator .",
    "this is possible because the momenta which generate the gap are much larger than the scale of the gap . to see this , note that in the transverse gluon propagator , ( [ approxspec ] ) , landau damping contributes to the gluon propagator when the momentum @xmath603 ; since the frequency @xmath179 , the dominant momenta are @xmath604 , which for small @xmath302 is much larger than @xmath302 .",

    "the gap function acquires a nonzero imaginary part when its momentum is away from the fermi surface .",
    "a quark can scatter into a quark with a different momentum through a very soft gluon .",

    "( [ defvarx ] ) , momenta exponentially close to the fermi surface occur when @xmath615 ( in weak coupling ) . in this region ,",
    "the imaginary part of the gap function , @xmath616 , is _ down _ by @xmath365 relative to the real part , @xmath617 . at the fermi surface itself , @xmath359 ,",
    "the imaginary part vanishes .",
    "away from the fermi surface , @xmath618 , so @xmath619 , and @xmath331 is strongly damped , with the real and imaginary parts of comparable magnitude , @xmath620 .",
    "a gap function with a nonzero imaginary part is actually well known from strongly coupled superconductors , as studied in eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "damping occurs for a similar reason as here , due to a nonzero imaginary part for the plasmon .",
    "there is no problem in principle with including the damping of the gap function .",
    "a spectral representation for the gap function is introduced , analogous to that of the quark and gluon propagators .",
    "the resulting gap integrals are more involved ( especially at nonzero temperature ) , but can be treated in the manner which we employed above .    * ( v ) magnetic mass : * + as argued in section i , at zero temperature the scale for the magnetic mass is @xmath21 .",
    "it is therefore negligible compared to the scale of the condensate . at nonzero temperature ,",
    "the scale is no larger than @xmath621 . for @xmath622 ,",
    "this is down by @xmath5 , and will only affect the prefactor of the gap to higher order in @xmath4 .",
    "we conclude by stressing that the determination of the prefactor is not merely an interesting problem in its own right , but because it truly determines the physics of color superconductivity ( at least in weak coupling ) . to the order at which we compute",
    ", there is absolutely _ no _ preference for the condensate to favor spin - zero over spin - one ( or spin - two , _ etc . _  ! ) .",
    "surely the spin - one condensate is less favored than spin - zero ; the ratio of the two condensates is , in weak coupling , a pure number which can be uniquely computed , once one knows how to compute the prefactor in the condensate .    indeed , perhaps one should entertain a more speculative hypothesis . even if a @xmath0 gap is favored , maybe there is always some small admixture of higher - spin gaps , and rotational invariance is inevitably broken in the true ground state of color superconductivity .",
