    "to the broadcast nature of wireless medium , the confidentiality of wireless communications is vulnerable to an eavesdropping attack [ 1 ] .",
    "physical layer security is emerging as a promising paradigm against eavesdropping and has attracted considerable attention recently .",
    "different from the conventional encryption methods [ 2 ] , it mainly exploits the physical characteristics of wireless channels to enhance the security of the signal transmission from its source to the intended destination .",
    "physical layer security work was pioneered by wyner for a discrete memoryless wiretap channel [ 3 ] , which later on , was extended to a gaussian wiretap channel in [ 4 ] .",
    "the secrecy capacity which is the maximum of secrecy rate was developed to evaluate the physical - layer security performance . in [ 4 ] , it showed that the secrecy capacity can be expressed as the difference between the channel capacity from source to destination ( referred to as main channel ) and the channel capacity from source to eavesdropper ( called wiretap channel ) in the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "+ multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) [ 5]-[11 ] has been widely considered as an effective way to improve physical layer security by exploiting multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver . however , due to the battery power and terminal size limitations , it may be difficult to implement multiple antennas in some cases e.g. handheld terminals and wireless sensors . as a consequence ,",
    "node cooperation is considered to be an effective means of enhancing the secrecy capacity by allowing the network nodes to share each other s antennas [ 12]-[31 ] .",
    "generally , there are two efficient ways to make use of multiple intermediate nodes : cooperative beamforming and cooperative jamming .",
    "to be specific , cooperative bearmforming helps to improve the capacity of main channel , which may include relay selection and beamforming [ 12]-[18 ] .",
    "by contrast , cooperative jamming aims to degrade the capacity of the wiretap channel by sending artificial noise to interfere with the eavesdropper without affecting the legitimate destination [ 19]-[21 ] .",
    "both cooperative beamforming and jamming are capable of increasing the secrecy capacity of wireless communications in the presence of an eavesdropper .",
    "+ in [ 12 ] and [ 13 ] , the authors studied the cooperative beamforming and cooperative jamming separately , where all the intermediate nodes are used either to assist the source transmission or to send a jamming signal for interfering with the eavesdropper .",
    "the transmit power at the source and the weights of intermediate nodes are determined to maximize the secrecy rate subject to a total power constraint . in",
    "[ 14 ] , an optimal relay selection scheme was proposed by taking into account the channel state information ( csi ) of both the main channel and wiretap channel , which is shown to achieve a better security performance than the conventional relay selection and combining methods . almost meanwhile , cooperative jamming was also studied for increasing the secrecy rate . in [ 19 ] , optimal cooperative jamming was studied with an emphasis on how to guarantee a positive secrecy rate . in [ 20 ] , the use of a jammer was proposed to send artificial noise along with confidential signal for confusing the wiretap link and enhancing the main link simultaneously .",
    "+ the aforementioned studies are based on the ideal assumption that the instantaneous csi of both main and wiretap links are known .",
    "considering that obtaining the instantaneous csi of the wiretap channel is challenging in many cases , y. su et al .",
    "[ 22 ] investigated the relay selection and power allocation by assuming that the correlation between the real and outdated csis is known without requiring the instantaneous csi . in [ 23 ] ,",
    "x. gong et al . presented a robust relay beamforming scheme which maximizes the worst - case transmit power of the artificial noise with imperfect csi .",
    "moreover , in [ 24 ] , f. s. al - qahtani et al . studied the impact of csi feedback delay on the secrecy performance of three different diversity combining methods under the imperfect csi case .",
    "in addition , c. wang et al . [ 25 ] investigated the relay selection and power allocation between two sources and mulitiple relays for a two - way amplify - and - forward ( af ) wireless network based on statistical channel information .",
    "+ in order to take both advantages of cooperative beamforming and cooperative jamming , various joint relay selection and jamming ( jrjs ) schemes were proposed for further enhancing the wireless secrecy performance , where some intermediate nodes help the legitimate transmission while some other nodes may jam the eavesdropper [ 26]-[31 ] .",
    "more specifically , the authors of [ 26 ] and [ 27 ] selected one intermediate node as the relay and two other nodes as jammers in a two - way cooperative network , achieving a better secrecy performance than conventional non - jamming schemes .",
    "two different channel knowledge assumptions were considered in [ 27 ] : 1 ) an instantaneous csi of the eavesdropping channel is assumed to be known , and 2 ) only an average csi of the wiretap channel is known . by contrast , in [ 28 ] and [ 29 ] , one intermediate node was chosen as the jammer to send artificial noise and the other intermediate nodes were considered to be relays for data transmission .",
    "a second - order convex cone programming algorithm was proposed in [ 29 ] to obtain sub - optimal beamforming weights and power allocation without eavesdropper s csi . in [ 30 ] , an intermediate node that achieves the highest instantaneous signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the second hop was selected as the relay and a node of minimizing the interference imposed on the destination was used as the jammer , where an outdated estimated csi is assumed .",
    "additionally , an opportunistic relaying scheme with the artificial jamming was proposed in [ 31 ] , where the power allocation between the confidential signal and jamming signals is optimized to maximize the ergodic secrecy rate .",
    "+ in this paper , we propose a new jrjs scheme to enhance the physical layer security .",
    "specifically , an intermediate node which can successfully decode the source signal is selected to act as the relay for assisting the source transmission , while the remaining intermediate nodes are employed as friendly jammers to transmit null - steering artificial noise for confusing the eavesdropper without affecting the legitimate destination .",
    "we select one intermediate node as the relay to exploit the full spatial diversity and the others as jammers for the sake of reducing the complexity of jrjs without an extra jammer selection .",
    "in addition , if we select multiple intermediate nodes as the relays to help signal transmission in different channels , there would be more links where the eavesdropper can tap the legitimite transmission .",
    "moreover , if the multiple relays share a common channel to forward their re - encoded outcomes , the corresponding symbol - level synchronization among the spatially distributed relays is very complex .",
    "+ considering that the secrecy performance would be affected by the power allocation among the source , relay and jammers , we further formulate a power allocation optimization problem to maximize the secrecy rate of the proposed jrjs scheme subject to a total power constraint and derive a closed - form sub - optimal power allocation solution .",
    "it is noted that the total power constraint is widely used in literature e.g. , [ 12]-[13 ] , [ 15]-[17 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 25 ] and [ 30]-[31 ] . in our proposed jrjs scheme , the relay selection and power allocation are jointly optimized by taking into account both the transimission rate and secrecy rate . since the instantaneous csi may be unavailable in some practical scenarios , we consider two different csi cases in this paper , which are called the full csi ( fcsi ) and partial csi ( pcsi ) , respectively .",
    "the fcsi assumes that the instantaneous csi of both main channel and wiretap channel is known , while the pcsi only requires the main channel s instantaneous csi along with the statistical wiretap channel knowledge .",
    "+ the main contributions of our work are summarized as follows .",
    "+ firstly , the relay and jammer selection as well as the power allocation are jointly carried out to maximize the secrecy rate of legitimate transmission . to be specific , for each relay candidate",
    ", we derive an optimal power allocation solution and obtain the corresponding secrecy rate result .",
    "after that , the candidate that maximizes the secrecy rate is selected as the relay .",
    "secondly , considering that the secrecy performance would be affected by the power allocation among the source , relay and jammers , we formulate a power allocation problem for maximizing the secrecy rate of proposed jrjs scheme subject to a total power constraint . moreover , we derive closed - form sub - optimal solutions to the formulated power allocation problem under fcsi and pcsi assumptions , respectively",
    ". + the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model and secrecy rate analysis are presented . in section iii , we derive the power allocation schemes under the fcsi and pcsi assumptions , respectively .",
    "numerical evaluation results are described in section iv and main conclusions are drawn in section v. +",
    "we consider a decode - and - forward ( df ) cooperative wireless network consisting of one source @xmath0 , one destination @xmath1 and @xmath2 intermediate nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "each node in the whole network is only equipped with a single antenna .",
    "the solid and dash lines represent the main and wiretap links , respectively .",
    "both the main and wiretap links are modeled as rayeigh fading channels and the thermal noise received at any node is modeled as a complex gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that there is a direct link from the source to the eavesdropper and no direct link from the source to the destination .",
    "@xmath2 intermediate nodes are exploited to assist the signal transmission from the source to the destination .",
    "+ in this paper , we propose a new jrjs scheme , where the intermediate nodes are divided into two groups : one relay node @xmath5 and @xmath6 jammers @xmath7 , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . more specifically ,",
    "in the first phase , the source node broadcasts a signal @xmath8 with power @xmath9 to @xmath2 intermediate nodes , which all attempt to decode their received signals . due to the broadcasting nature , the signal @xmath8 is also received by the eavesdropper . for convenience , the intermediate nodes which succeed in decoding the source signal",
    "are denoted by a decoding set @xmath10 . in the second phase ,",
    "we select one intermediate node from @xmath10 as the relay @xmath5 to re - encode and transmit its decoded outcome to the destination with power @xmath11 .",
    "meanwhile , the remaining @xmath6 intermediate nodes are enabled to act as friendly jammers @xmath7 , to transmit artificial noise @xmath12 for confusing the eavesdropper .",
    "we assume that the distances among intermediate nodes are much smaller than the distances between intermediate nodes and the source / destination / eavesdropper following [ 30 ] .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for both wsns and manets associated with a clustered relay configuration . under this assumption ,",
    "the corresponding path losses among the relay and jammers are approximately the same , hence we simplify our work without considering path loss .",
    "+ in this paper , we assume that the whole wireless network is to operate under a total power constraint following [ 12]-[13 ] , [ 15]-[17 ] , [ 21 ] , [ 25 ] and [ 30]-[31 ] , which is widely adopted in both secrecy performance analysis and optimal design .",
    "for example , as indicated in [ 17 ] , half of the maximum power budget is allocated to the two transceivers and the remaining half will be shared among all the relay nodes for symmetric relaying schemes . in [ 30 ] , it pointed out the secrecy performance is effected by power allocation between the relay and jammers .",
    "futhermore , from a network design of view , such an assumption allows to optimize total power consumed in the whole network .",
    "in addition , the solved transmit power at the relay also provides a guideline for the transmit power of individual relays .",
    "the optimal power allocation among the source , relay and jammers will be addressed in following section iii .",
    "+     intermediate nodes . ]    in the first phase , the source transmits a signal @xmath13 with power @xmath9 .",
    "the intermediate node @xmath14 and eavesdropper @xmath3 thus receive @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent a fading coefficient of the channel from the source to the intermediate node @xmath14 and eavesdropper @xmath3 , respectively , @xmath19 is additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at the intermediate node @xmath14 , and @xmath20 is awgn at @xmath3 .",
    "+ in the second phase , the relay @xmath5 is selected from the decoding set @xmath10 for signal transmission with power @xmath11 . meanwhile , each jammer @xmath21 transmits an artificial noise signal @xmath12 .",
    "it needs to be pointed out that the vector of the artificial noise @xmath22 should be normalized .",
    "the total transmit power at all the jammers is denoted as @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the received signal at the destination is expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents a fading coefficient of the channel from the relay @xmath5 to destination , @xmath26 represents a fading coefficient of the channel from the jammer @xmath27 to destination and @xmath28 represents awgn at the destination .",
    "the received signal at the eavesdropper is expressed as @xmath29 where @xmath30 represents a fading coefficient of the channel from the relay to eavesdropper , @xmath31 represents a fading coefficient of the channel from the jammer @xmath21 to eavesdropper and @xmath32 represents awgn at the eavesdropper .",
    "+ for simplicity , let us define @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "considering that the artificial noise should not interfere with @xmath35 , we design @xmath36 as a normalized signal onto the null space of @xmath37 so that @xmath38",
    ". as a consequence , we obtain ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) as @xmath39 and @xmath40 which completes the signal modeling of the jrjs scheme .      in [ 32 ] , a variable transmission parameter scheme where the source and relay use different codebooks with different code rates is proposed for df relay networks to further improve the secrecy performance . in [ 33 ] , a framework is provided to determine the wiretap code rates to achieve the locally maximum effective secrecy throughput . in this paper",
    ", we still consider the case where the source and relay transmit signal using the same code with the same code rate @xmath41 in both main and wiretap links and focus on how to allocate transmit power among the source , relay and all the jammers to maximize the secrecy rate of the proposed jrjs scheme .",
    "although we do not propose a new transmission parameter design scheme in this paper , we take into account the effect of @xmath41 on the secrecy rate and set @xmath41 to different values based on the values of @xmath42 by experimental experience , which will be shown in the following experimental section .",
    "+ when the source and relay transmit the same code with @xmath41 , the rate of df transmission from source @xmath0 via the relay @xmath5 to destination @xmath1 , @xmath43 , is obtained as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 represent the rate of the link from @xmath0 to @xmath5 and the rate of the link from @xmath5 to @xmath1 , respectively , which are given as @xmath47 and @xmath48 it is noted that the relay @xmath5 is selected from the decoding set @xmath10 . that is",

    "in this subsection , we focus on how to select the optimal relay @xmath5 and allocate the optimal transmit power @xmath9 , @xmath11 and @xmath23 to maximize the instantaneous secrecy rate stated as ( 15 ) assuming the avaibility of global instantaneous csi .",
    "the assumption is reasonable in some cases [ 34]-[36 ] .",
    "for example , we consider the scenario in which a legal user in the wireless network is captured by trojan and slaved as an eavesdropper to tap the signal transmission . in this case",
    ", a broadcasting network consisting of multiple legal receivers among which some are slaved by trojan and become eavesdroppers , turns into a wiretap system , where the global instantaneous csi of the eavesdroppers may be available .",
    "for another example , in a scenario where a single active eavesdropper is registered in the wireless network as a subscribed user and exchanges signaling messages with the source and intermediate nodes , the global instantaneous csi of the eavesdropper may be known .",
    "+ under the fcsi assumption , the joint relay selection and power allocation problem can be formulated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the total power budget for transmitting one source symbol , which is also the sum of the transmit power at the source , relay and jammers .",
    "problem ( 16 ) can be performed in two steps . at the first step , each intermediate node @xmath14 in the decoding set @xmath10",
    "is treated as a candidate of relay . for each candidate @xmath62 , we solve the following power allocation problem to maximize the secrecy rate of the corresponding jrjs scheme , @xmath63 at the second step , the candidate which leads to the maximum of the secrecy rate results with the optimal power allocation solution above is selected as the relay @xmath5 .",
