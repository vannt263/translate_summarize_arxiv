    "choptuik s discovery of critical phenomena in the gravitational collapse of a scalar field @xcite sparked a surge of interest in gravitational collapse just at the threshold of black hole formation .",
    "the discovery of critical behavior in several other matter models quickly followed .",
    "despite the fact that the evolution equations are very complex and highly non - linear , the dynamics of the near - critical field evolution is relatively simple and , in some important aspects , universal .",
    "the critical solution , which depends on the matter model only , serves as an intermediate attractor in the phase space of solutions , and often has an additional peculiar symmetry called self - similarity .",
    "the mass of the black hole produced in supercritical evolution scales as a power law @xmath0 with parameter @xmath1 describing initial data , and mass - scaling exponent @xmath2 is dependent only on the matter model , but not on the initial data family . an interesting consequence of mass scaling which has direct bearing on the cosmic censorship conjecture is the fact that arbitrarily small black holes can be produced in near - critical collapse , with the critical solution exhibiting a curvature singularity and no event horizon .",
    "the explanation of the universality of the critical behavior lies in perturbation analysis and renormalization group ideas .",
    "it turns out that critical solutions generally have only one unstable perturbation mode , making them the most important solutions for understanding the dynamics of field evolution , after the stable ones ( flat space and schwarzschild or kerr - newman black hole ) .",
    "as the near - critical field configuration evolves , all its perturbation modes decay , losing information about the initial data and bringing the solution closer to critical , except the one growing mode which will eventually drive the solution to black hole formation or dispersal , depending on its content in the initial data .",
    "thus the critical solution acts as an intermediate attractor ( of codimension one ) in the phase space of field configurations .",
    "finding the eigenvalue of the growing perturbation mode allows one to calculate important parameters of the critical evolution , the mass - scaling exponent in particular .",
    "an important question is how generic the critical behavior is with respect to initial data , or , in phase space language , how big is the basin of attraction of the critical solution .",
    "so far most of the work on critical gravitational collapse , numerical or analytic , has been restricted to the case of spherical symmetry , simply because of the enormous difficulties in treating fully general non - symmetric solutions of einstein equations .",
    "a natural concern is whether the critical phenomena observed so far are limited to spherical symmetry , and whether the evolution of non - spherical data will lead to the same results .",
    "the numerical study of abrahams and evans on axisymmetric gravitational wave collapse and recent numerical perturbation calculations by gundlach @xcite give numerical evidence for the claim that critical phenomena are not restricted to spherical symmetry , and that the critical solutions are indeed attractors in the full phase space .",
    "in this paper we search for analytical evidence to support that claim .",
    "one of the few known closed form solutions related to critical phenomena is the roberts solution , originally constructed as a counterexample to the cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite , and later rediscovered in the context of critical gravitational collapse .",
    "it is a continuously self - similar solution of a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of a minimally coupled massless scalar field .",
    "while it is not a proper critical solution , as it has more than one growing mode @xcite , it is still a good ( and simple ) toy model of the critical collapse of the scalar field .",
    "this paper considers fully general perturbations of the roberts solution in a gauge - invariant formalism . due to the symmetries of the background , the linear perturbation equations decouple and the variables separate , so an exact analytical treatment is possible .",
    "we find that there are no growing perturbation modes apart from spherically symmetric ones described earlier @xcite .",
    "so all the non - sphericity of the initial data decays in the collapse of the scalar field , and only the spherically symmetric part will play a role in the critical behavior .    to our knowledge , this is the first paper to obtain analytical results on non - spherical critical collapse .",
    "the spacetime we will use as a background in our calculations is a continuously self - similar spherically symmetric solution of the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field ( the roberts solution ) .",
    "the einstein - scalar field equations @xmath3 can be solved analytically in spherical symmetry by imposing continuous self - similarity on the solution , i.e. by assuming that there exists a vector field @xmath4 such that @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes lie derivative .",
    "self - similar solutions form a one - parameter family , which is most easily derived in null coordinates .",
    "the critical solution is given by the metric @xmath7 where @xmath8.\\ ] ] the global structure of the critical spacetime is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : roberts ] .",
    "the influx of the scalar field is turned on at the advanced time @xmath9 , so that the spacetime is minkowskian to the past of this surface .",
    "the initial conditions for the field equations ( [ eq : r ] ) and ( [ eq : box ] ) are specified there by the continuity of the solution .",
    "it is instructive to rewrite roberts solution in new coordinates so that the self - similarity becomes apparent . for this purpose",
    "we introduce scaling coordinates @xmath10 , \\hspace{1em }    s = - \\ln(-u),\\ ] ] with the inverse transformation @xmath11 the signs are chosen to make the arguments of the logarithm positive in the region of interest ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , where the field evolution occurs . in these coordinates the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) becomes @xmath14 +      r^2\\ , d\\omega^2,\\ ] ] and the critical solution ( [ eq : crit ] ) is simply @xmath15 observe that the scalar field @xmath16 does not depend on the scale variable @xmath17 at all , and the only dependence of the metric coefficients on the scale is through the conformal factor @xmath18 .",
    "this is a direct expression of the geometric requirement ( [ eq : ss ] ) in scaling coordinates ; the homothetic killing vector @xmath4 is simply @xmath19 .",
    "to avoid complicated gauge issues of fully general perturbations , we will use the gauge - invariant formalism developed by gerlach and sengupta .",
    "this formalism describes perturbations around a general spherically symmetric background @xmath20 which in our case we take to be the roberts solution ( [ eq : metric ] ) . here and",
    "later capital latin indices take values @xmath21 , and lower - case latin indices run over angular coordinates . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined on a spacetime two - manifold , while @xmath24 is the metric of the unit two - sphere .",
    "because the background spacetime is spherically symmetric , perturbations around it can be decomposed in spherical harmonics .",
    "scalar spherical harmonics @xmath25 have even parity under spatial inversion , while vector spherical harmonics @xmath26 have odd parity .",
    "we will only concern ourselves with even - parity perturbations here , since odd - parity perturbations can not couple to scalar field perturbations .",
    "we will focus on non - spherical perturbation modes ( @xmath27 ) , as the spherically symmetric case ( @xmath28 ) was studied earlier @xcite . for clarity , angular indices @xmath29 and the summation over all harmonics will be suppressed from now on .",

    "only gauge - invariant quantities have physical meaning in the perturbation problem .",
    "all physics of the problem , including the equations of motion and boundary conditions , should be written in terms of these gauge - invariant quantities . once gauge - invariant quantities have been identified ,",
    "one is free to convert between gauge - invariant perturbation amplitudes and their values in whatever gauge choice one desires .",
    "we will work in longitudinal gauge ( @xmath41 ) , which is particularly convenient since perturbation amplitudes in it are just equal to the corresponding gauge - invariant quantities .",
    "the above condition fixes the gauge uniquely for non - spherical modes .",
    "( there is some gauge freedom left over for the @xmath28 mode , but remember that we are only concerned with higher @xmath42 modes . )",
    "expressions for the components of the linear perturbation equations @xmath43 for a fully general perturbation in longitudinal gauge are collected in appendix  [ sec : long ] . by inspection of the @xmath44 component of the equations ,",
    "it is clear that the equations of motion require that @xmath45 for @xmath27 . with the change of notation @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the remaining equations of motion for non - spherical modes",

    "the hypergeometric equation coefficients are different for equations describing the perturbations @xmath105 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath34 ; they are summarized in the table below .",

    "we will now investigate what restrictions the boundary conditions place on the hypergeometric equation coefficients .",
    "the vanishing of perturbation amplitudes at @xmath115 rules out @xmath113 as a component of the solution and requires that @xmath119 to make @xmath114 go to zero .",
