    "the first detection of gravitational waves was made recently by advanced ligo on september 14 , 2015 validating the einsteins general theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "it was soon followed by the second detection on december 26 , 2015 .",
    "these events are referred to as gw150914 and gw151226 @xcite . in both the events",
    "the gravitational waves were generated by a pair of black holes which orbited one another with decaying orbits and eventually merged to form a single black hole .",
    "a gigantic amount of energy worth @xmath0 solar masses was emitted in the first event gw150914 within the timescale of few milli - seconds exceeding the integrated intensity of all stars in the observable universe by two orders of magnitude . these and many other observations related to binary black holes in electromagnetic band @xcite,@xcite suggest that the system consisting of two black holes in the close vicinity can host a wide variety of remarkable phenomenon that would be interesting both from the point of view of astrophysics and fundamental physics . in this paper",
    "we explore binary black holes from a different perspective .",
    "we study gravitational lensing by a pair of black holes and show that this system can exhibit novel features which are quite unprecedented and absent in any other gravitational lensing configuration studied so far .",
    "the analysis of the gravitational lensing is also a timely from the point of view of event horizon telescope and gravity collaborations which would in near future take snapshots of supermassive black holes at the center of our and nearby galaxies @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the two body problem in general relativity is extremely difficult , in contrast with newtonian gravity . this is essentially consequence of the fact that einstein equations are complicated coupled non - liner partial differential equations that are difficult to deal with .",
    "there are no exact solutions to einstein equations depicting binary black holes that could be applicable in the realistic astrophysical context . in this paper",
    "we work with the majumdar - papapetrou solution depicting multiple black holes in the equilibrium , which could be thought of as a simple toy model that might capture some of the features in a realistic scenario .",
    "majumdar - papapetrou metric is perhaps the simplest multi - black hole solution known so far .",
    "it was discovered independently by majumdar and papapetrou @xcite,@xcite and later demonstrated to represent spacetime with multiple black holes @xcite .",
    "there were many interesting investigations that were carried out in the context of majumdar - papapetrou spacetime @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "we also note that the gravitational lensing in the context of the full - fledged numerical relativity simulation of binary black hole merger was studied in @xcite .",
    "we focus on the case where majumdar - papapetrou metric represents two identical equal mass non - rotating black holes at rest with respect to one another at certain distance .",
    "the metric is static , has a rotational symmetry around the line joining two black holes and reflection symmetry about the plane that is midway between the two black holes , which intersects line joining two black holes orthogonally .",
    "we assume that the light source and observer are located on the symmetry plane and focus on light rays which are confined to move on this plane .",
    "this allows us to employ various techniques developed to study gravitational lensing on the equatorial plane of spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the central point of the symmetry plane which is also the point exactly midway between two black holes on the axis essentially acts as a gravitational lens .",
    "the photon sphere plays an important role in the relativistic gravitational lensing .",
    "recently it was demonstrated @xcite that the number of photon spheres on the symmetry plane depends on the distance between the two black holes .",
    "if the distance between the two black holes is small , then the symmetry place exhibits two photon spheres , one of which is unstable and the other one is stable . as the distance is increased the two photon spheres approach each other , merge and disappear .",
    "so when the distance is larger than the certain critical threshold value , there are no photon spheres on the equatorial plane .",
    "the properties of relativistic images and caustics are radically different depending on whether two photon spheres are present and absent .",
    "the existence of the stable photon sphere in the context of the axially symmetric electro - vacuum spacetimes was studied in @xcite .",
    "we would like to mention that what we refer to photon sphere is in fact a ring rather than being a sphere since we restrict out attention on the plane midway between the black holes .",
    "the structure of images formed due to the photons that turn back from the region above the outer unstable photon sphere is same as in the case of schwarzschild black hole @xcite,@xcite .",
    "all the images lie beyond certain critical angular radius with respect to the lens .",
    "there are infinite images clubbed together close to this critical radius . in case of schwarzschild black hole",
    "there is a dark region below the critical radius with no images , which is consequence of the fact that the light rays which enter the single unstable photon sphere never turn back and enter black hole .",
    "the situation is drastically different in case of the di - hole in the presence of second stable inner photon sphere .",
    "as we will show , the effective potential turns upward again and the photons that enter outer photon sphere can now turn back .",
    "this leads to the formation of new infinite set of relativistic images , all of which lie inside the critical radius mentioned above .",
    "the region which would have been dark in the case of a single black hole , is not dark in the presence of the two photon spheres .",
    "again most of the images are crowded together close to the critical radius and few discrete images lie close to the lens . in the absence of the photon",
    "sphere a finite number of discrete relativistic images are formed .",
    "interestingly the radial caustic is present in this case .",
    "this is the location where the map between image plane and source plane is degenerate .",
    "relativistic radial caustic has never been reported before in any other investigation so far .",
    "thus we demonstrate that new novel features arise both in the presence and absence of twin photon spheres .",
    "we note that the system similar to the one we investigated in this paper where there are two black holes and source which could be bright spot in the accretion disk or maybe in the gas cloud falling towards black holes may not be so hard to realize in the nature . based on our analysis and expectation that we might capture some of the features in the realistic scenario",
    ", we anticipate that the gravitational lensing signature of such a system will be characteristic and peculiar .",
    "thus gravitational lensing signal will allow us to locate a binary black hole system in the sky and thus reduce the number of parameters in the search for gravitational waves from binary black holes in the interferometric detectors such as ligo , virgo and kagra using matched filtering .",
    "this suggests that our investigation could possibly have serious implications for gravitational wave data analysis .",
    "in this section we describe the majumdar - papapetrou di - hole metric and null geodesics . in classical mechanics",
    "a system of particles at rest with charge equal to mass is in the equilibrium for arbitrary distance between the particles .",
    "interestingly same is true in general relativity as well .",
    "a system of maximally charged non - rotating black holes are in equilibrium irrespective of the distance between them .",
    "the static electro - vacuum spacetime depicting this scenario is majumdar - papapetrou metric which is the simplest multi - black hole exact solution in general relativity and thus it has served as a toy - model for numerous analytical investigations as quoted in the introductory section .",
    "the radius of photon sphere @xmath1 is plotted against the mass to distance ratio @xmath2 .",
    "below @xmath3 there is no photon sphere . at @xmath4",
    "we have a single degenerate photon sphere located at @xmath5 . above @xmath6 there are two photon spheres .",
    "the radius of outer photon sphere is denoted by @xmath7 and that of inner photon sphere is denoted by @xmath8.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in this paper we focus on the special case of the majumdar - papapetrou metric which represents two equal mass maximally charged non - rotating black holes in equilibrium at fixed distance between them .",
    "we call it a di - hole metric",
    ". the spacetime is static and asymptotically flat .",
    "it admits a rotational symmetry about the line joining two black holes and reflection symmetry about the plane that is midway between the black holes . in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath9 , which is well - adapted to the symmetries , the di - hole metric is given by @xmath10 where the metric function @xmath11 is given by @xmath12",
    "each of the black holes has mass @xmath2 .",
    "the black holes are located at @xmath13 and @xmath14 on @xmath15axis about which there is a rotational symmetry and the symmetry plane @xmath16 is located midway between the two black holes . in this coordinates black holes appear as points .",
    "we find it to convenient to work in the units where @xmath17 is set to unity and thus all dimensional quantities are appropriately expressed in units of @xmath17 which is half of the coordinate distance between the two black holes .",
    "we focus our attention on the null geodesics that are restricted to move on the symmetry plane @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the four - velocity of the light ray . using the standard techniques of dealing with null geodesics with the help of conserved quantities associated with symmetries of metric and normalization of velocity @xcite we obtain the non - zero components of four - velocity as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the impact parameter , @xmath21 in the expression for @xmath22 stands for the photons moving clockwise and anti - clockwise respectively and @xmath21 in the expression for @xmath23 stands for the photons which move in radially outwards and inwards respectively .",
    "the function @xmath24 in the expression above is now @xmath25 where @xmath2 is twice ratio of mass and distance between the black holes .",
    "the equation describing the radial motion of the light ray can be recast in the form @xmath26 @xmath27 is the effective potential for radial motion .",
    "it is quite useful to use the analogy of a particle moving in potential well in classical mechanics while dealing with the radial motion of photon .",
    "the location of the circular photon orbit i.e. photon sphere can be obtained by solving the equation @xmath28 which is given by @xmath29 with the substitution @xmath30 , the above equation can be cast into a cubic equation @xmath31 the existence or not of the photon spheres is determined by the discriminant of the cubic @xmath32 .",
    "the critical value of parameter @xmath2 for which discriminant is zero is given by @xmath33    when @xmath6 , the discriminant of cubic is positive and two photon spheres are present .",
    "we obtain location of the photon spheres by solving the cubic equation with trigonometric method @xcite .",

    "\\label{rout}\\ ] ] the effective potential @xmath27 admits a maximum at @xmath35 and hence the outer photon sphere is `` unstable '' . the location of inner photon sphere denoted by @xmath8 is given by @xmath36 \\right)^2 - 1   } .",
    "\\label{rin}\\ ] ] since the effective potential admits a minimum at @xmath37 , the inner photon sphere is `` stable '' .",
    "the location of photon spheres as a function of @xmath2 is depicted in fig.[phs ] , which is same as fig.4 in @xcite .    when @xmath4 , two photon spheres coincide and we have a single degenerate photon sphere located at @xmath38 whereas in the case @xmath39 , the discriminant of a cubic is negative and circular photon orbits are absent .",
    "as mentioned earlier @xmath2 is ratio of mass to the distance between the black holes .",
    "so the results obtained in this section imply that for a fixed mass , if the distance between the black holes is below certain critical value , two photon spheres are present on the symmetry plane @xmath16 midway between the black holes . as the black holes recede from another , two photon spheres come together , merge and eventually disappear above the critical distance . as we demonstrate in this paper ,",
    "the gravitational lensing signature of binary black holes is radically different depending on whether the photon spheres are present .",
    "thus the separation between the black holes for fixed mass dictates the existence or otherwise of twin photon spheres and the gravitational lensing signature of the binary black holes .",
    "in this section we describe the basics of the gravitational lensing formalism that we employ in our investigation of majumdar - papapetrou di - hole .",
    "we assume that the source of light and observer are located on the symmetry plane @xmath16 placed midway between the black holes .",
    "we restrict our attention to the light rays that are allowed to move on the plane @xmath16 .",
    "this allows us to employ the formalism developed for the lensing of light on the equatorial plane of spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "we note that the central point with @xmath40 on the plane @xmath16 , which is also the point midway between the two identical black holes , essentially acts as a gravitational lens in our investigation for all practical purposes .     the lens diagram .",

    "@xmath20 is the impact parameter.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    we assume that both source and observer are located faraway from the central point and also from the two black holes in the asymptotic region which is approximately flat . thus the light ray starts from infinity , falls toward the center as it gets bent , admits a turning point at @xmath51 and returns to infinity .",
    "the total amount of deflection suffered by the light ray in its journey is given by @xmath52 while obtaining the equation above from ( [ vel ] ) we have used the fact that radial component of velocity is zero at the turning point , i.e. , @xmath53 and thus the impact parameter @xmath20 can be related to @xmath54 via @xmath55 later in the paper we employ clever techniques proposed by bozza @xcite and develop their generalizations in order to get an approximate expression for deflection angle in various situations .",
    "we further assume that the source is located approximately behind the lens with respect to the observer .",
    "this allows us to use virbhadra - ellis lens equation @xcite .",
    "we note that there are other lens equations in the literature which also work equally well in this approximation such as virbhadra - narasimha - chitre lens equation proposed earlier in @xcite and so on .",

    "this situation is quite different in case of the black holes where the effective potential does not rise again for lower values of radial coordinates and light rays which enter the photon sphere necessarily enter the event horizon .",

    "the merger of two images separated from another in the radial direction with respect to the lens is referred to as radial caustic .",

    "radial caustic is different from the tangential caustic which refers to the appearance of the einstein ring or the merger of two images for a given source location that are separated from one another in tangential sense with respect to the lens .",
    "thus we discover a novel future in case of the binary black hole when separation between the black holes is moderately large . for a distance between black hole that is too large i.e. when",
    "@xmath260 the deflection angle is small compared to @xmath63 and thus no relativistic images are formed .",
    "in this paper we studied the gravitational lensing by binary black holes . in the absence of any simple exact solution depicting the realistic binary black hole scenario , we resort to the use of majumdar - papapetrou metric which is the simplest multi - black hole solution is general relativity .",
    "we consider a scenario where the majumdar - papapetrou solution represents two equal mass maximally charged non - rotating black holes in equilibrium separated from one another by some distance .",
    "we focused on the case where the source of light and observers were located on the symmetry plane midway between the black holes and the light was allowed to move on the plane .",
    "the central point on the symmetry plane which is also the point midway between the black hole acts a gravitational lens .",
    "the source , observer and the lens are assumed to be in the near - aligned configuration .",
    "this allows us to employ the standard techniques developed to study the gravitational lensing in the spherically symmetric spacetimes on the equatorial plane .    the photon sphere which is the circular photon orbit plays a crucial role in the relativistic gravitational lensing .",
    "the dihole spacetime can admit multiple photon spheres depending on the parameter @xmath2 in the majumdar - papapetrou di - hole metric which is the ratio of the mass and distance between the black holes .",
    "when @xmath2 is greater than the critical value given by @xmath246 , i.e. when for a fixed mass two black holes are located close enough , two photon spheres are present in the plane midway between the black holes . for the critical value @xmath183 , two photon spheres coincide and we have a single degenerate photon sphere located at @xmath261 .",
    "as we further increase the the parameter @xmath2 beyond the critical value , i.e. when the distance between the black holes for a given mass is large enough , no photon spheres are present on the symmetry plane .",
    "the gravitational lensing signature is qualitatively different depending on whether the photon spheres are present or not .",
    "only one photon sphere is present in case of the single black hole .",
    "the light rays can have turning points outside the photon sphere , whereas the light rays that enter the photon sphere do not admit turning point and enter the black hole . thus the images are formed only due to the light rays that turn back outside the photon sphere , all of which lie beyond certain critical angular radius with respect to the optic axis .",
    "there is a dark region below the critical radius .",
    "the situation is different in case of dihole due to the presence of the second photon sphere .",
    "the effective potential now turns upwards again below the second inner photon sphere and thus the light rays which enter the outer photon sphere can turn back again . a new set of infinitely many images are formed due to the light rays which enter photon sphere and turn back which are formed below the critical radius and fill up the dark void region which is present in case of the single black hole .",
    "thus the pattern of images is drastically different in the presence of second inner photon sphere .",
    "the pattern of images in the presence of a single degenerate photon sphere is quite similar to the two photon sphere case , but the deflection angle shows power law divergence as opposed to logarithmic divergence in case of two photon spheres .    in the absence of the photon sphere the deflection angle remains finite and we witness a formation of finitely many discrete well - separated image .",
    "interestingly we also find the presence of radial caustic i.e. as we change the source location , the two images which are separated from one another in the radial direction with respect to the lens , approach one another and eventually merge together to form a single image . the map from image plane to source plane is degenerate at that instant .",
    "the radial caustic has never been reported before in any of the investigations so far related to the relativistic gravitational lensing .",
    "therefore we discover a novel feature in the study of binary black holes when the distance between the two black holes is above a threshold value .",
    "the system consisting of two black holes nearby and a source of light in the vicinity could be found in the astrophysical context . during the binary black hole inspiral two black holes approach one another as the system loses energy due to the emission of the gravitational waves and the conditions conducive to the realization of radial caustic and the new relativistic images in the region between the two black holes",
    "can potentially be met .",
    "the analysis carried out in this paper may possibly capture the some of the features related to the gravitational lensing signature of the realistic binary black hole system .",
    "new relativistic images and radial caustic can introduce additional features in the microlensing light curve of binary black holes .",
    "as gravitational lensing signature could be quite peculiar , it will allow us to identify the binary black hole system using electromagnetic observations .",
    "it would make it possible to infer the location of the binary black hole system on the sky and also possibly distance to the source .",
    "thus it will reduce the number of parameters in the search for gravitational waves from binary black holes in the interferometric detectors using the technique of matched filtering .",
    "this suggests that our investigation may have implications for gravitational wave data analysis .",
    "we note that the static di - hole system that is analyzed in this work is a good toy - model from which interesting physics can be studied as a proof of concept and one would have to resort to a numerical relativity simulations of the binary black hole to come up with the concrete predictions @xcite .",
