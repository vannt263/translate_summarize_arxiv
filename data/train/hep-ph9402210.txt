    "the copious production of @xmath4 quarks in @xmath5 decays at the large electron - positron collider ( lep ) and in 1.8-tev proton - antiproton collisions at the fermilab tevatron opens for study the rich spectroscopy of mesons and baryons beyond @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which have already been widely discussed , a particularly interesting case is the spectrum of @xmath2 states and its ground state , the @xmath10 meson @xcite .",
    "even more than their counterparts in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 families , the @xmath2 states that lie below the ( @xmath13 ) threshold for decay into a pair of heavy - flavored mesons are stable against strong decay , for they can not annihilate into gluons .",
    "their allowed decays , by e1 or m1 transitions or by hadronic cascades , lead to total widths that are less than a few hundred kev .",
    "all decay chains ultimately reach the @xmath14s@xmath15 ground state @xmath16 , which decays weakly .",
    "it may be possible , in time , to map out the excitation spectrum by observing photons or light hadrons in coincidence with a prominent decay of the @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this would test our understanding of the force between heavy quarks .",
    "the weak decays of the @xmath2 ground state will be of particular interest because the influence of the strong interaction can be estimated reliably @xcite .",
    "the deep binding of the heavy quarks within the @xmath16 means that the spectator picture is misleading . taking proper account of binding energy",
    ", we expect a rather long lifetime that implies easily observable secondary vertices .",
    "the deep binding also affects the @xmath16 branching fractions and leads us to expect that final states involving @xmath17 will be prominent .",
    "the modes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 will serve to identify @xmath16 mesons and determine the @xmath16 mass and lifetime .    in this article , we present a comprehensive portrait of the spectroscopy of the @xmath16 meson and its long - lived excited states . in section",
    "ii , we estimate the mass of the @xmath16 in the framework of nonrelativistic quarkonium quantum mechanics and calculate the spectrum of @xmath2 states in detail . in section iii",

    ", we outline a strategy for partially reconstructing the @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "a brief summary appears in section iv .",
    "both in mass and in size , the mesons with beauty and charm are intermediate between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states .",
    "estimates of the @xmath16 mass can , consequently , be tied to what is known about the charmonium and @xmath12 families .",
    "to predict the full spectrum and properties of @xmath2 states , we rely on the nonrelativistic potential - model description of quarkonium levels . the interquark potential is known rather accurately in the region of space important for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 families @xcite , which spans the distances important for @xmath2 levels .",
    "this region lies between the short - distance coulombic and long - distance linear behavior expected in qcd .",
    "we consider four functional forms for the potential that give reasonable accounts of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectra : the qcd - motivated potential @xcite given by buchmller and tye @xcite , with @xmath26 a power - law potential @xcite , @xmath27 with @xmath28 a logarithmic potential @xcite , @xmath29 with @xmath30 and a coulomb - plus - linear potential ( the `` cornell potential '' ) @xcite , @xmath31 with @xmath32    we solve the schrdinger equation for each of the potentials to determine the position of the 1s center of gravity for @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 . the @xmath33s@xmath34 ",

    "we neglect the variation of @xmath38 with momentum and scale the splitting of @xmath2 and @xmath1 from the charmonium value ( [ psisplit ] ) .",
    "the resulting values of vector and pseudoscalar masses are presented in table [ mass1s ] .",
    "predictions for the @xmath2 ground - state masses depend little on the potential .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath39 masses and splitting lie within the ranges quoted by kwong and rosner @xcite in their survey of techniques for estimating the masses of the @xmath2 ground state .",
    "they find @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 we take @xmath43 as our best guess for the interval in which @xmath16 will be found @xcite .",
    "we shall adopt the buchmller - tye potential @xcite for the detailed calculations that follow , because it has the correct two - loop short - distance behavior in perturbative qcd .",
    "the interaction energies of a heavy quark - antiquark system probe the basic dynamics of the strong interaction . the gross structure of the quarkonium spectrum reflects the shape of the interquark potential . in the absence of light quarks , the static energy explicitly exhibits linear confinement at large distance .",
    "further insight can be obtained by studying the spin - dependent forces , which distinguish the electric and magnetic parts of the interactions . within the framework of quantum chromodynamics , the nature of the spin - dependent forces",

    "the resulting leptonic widths , evaluated without qcd corrections , are tabulated in tables [ charmonium ] and [ upsilons ] . within each family ,",
    "the leptonic widths are predicted in proper proportions , but are larger than the observed values .",
    "the qcd correction reduces the magnitudes significantly ; the amount of this reduction is somewhat uncertain , because the first term in the perturbation expansion is large @xcite .    for unequal - mass quarks ,",

    "mostly radiative decays .",
    "a few hadronic cascades , analogs of the @xmath126 transition first observed in charmonium , will also be observable .      except for the magnetic - dipole ( spin - flip ) transition between the ground - state @xmath39 and @xmath16 ,",

    "a hadronic transition between quarkonium levels can be understood as a two - step process in which gluons first are emitted from the heavy quarks and then recombine into light hadrons .",
    "perturbative qcd is not directly applicable , because the energy available to the light hadrons is small and the emitted gluons are soft . nevertheless , the final quarkonium state is small compared to the system of light hadrons and moves nonrelativistically in the rest frame of the decaying quarkonium state .",
    "a multipole expansion of the color gauge field converges rapidly and leads to selection rules , a wigner - eckart theorem , and rate estimates for hadronic transitions @xcite .",
    "the recombination of gluons into light hadrons involves the full strong dynamics and can only be modeled .",

    "the relative strengths of various terms that contribute to magnetic - multipole transitions are modified because of the unequal quark and antiquark masses .",
    "the electric - multipole transitions are only sensitive to the relative position of the quark and antiquark and will be unchanged in form .    as in the @xmath144 and @xmath145 systems , the principal hadronic transitions in the @xmath62 system involve the emission of two pions .",
    "electric - dipole contributions dominate in these transitions , and so the equal - mass results apply directly .",

    "the corresponding quantum numbers of the final quarkonium state are denoted by the unprimed symbols . since the transition operator is spin - independent , the initial and final spins are the same : @xmath152 . because the gauge - field operators in the transition amplitude do not depend on the heavy - quark variables ,",
    "the transition operator is a reducible second - rank tensor , which may be decomposed into a sum of irreducible tensors with rank @xmath153 .",

    "the measured values for the @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 transition rates allow good scaling estimates for the @xmath169 and @xmath170 transitions in the @xmath62 system .",
