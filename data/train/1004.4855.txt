    "the weak decay of quarks depends on fundamental parameters of the standard model , including the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , which describes mixing between quark families  @xcite . extraction of these parameters from weak decays is complicated because the quarks are confined within color - singlet hadrons as described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "an essential tool used in this extraction is the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) technique  @xcite . in hqe",
    "the total decay width of a heavy hadron is expressed as an expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath5 . at @xmath6",
    "the lifetimes of all @xmath0 hadrons are identical .",
    "corrections to this simplification are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 calculations leading to the predicted lifetime hierarchy : @xmath9 and quantitative predictions of the lifetime ratios with respect to the @xmath10 meson  @xcite .",
    "the tevatron @xmath11 collider at @xmath12 tev has the energy to produce all @xmath0 hadron species .",
    "the decays of these hadrons are selected by a variety of successive trigger selection criteria applied at three trigger levels .",
    "unique to the cdf ii detector is the silicon vertex trigger ( svt ) , which selects events based on pairs of tracks displaced from the primary interaction point .",
    "this exploits the long lived nature of @xmath0 hadrons and collects samples of @xmath0 hadrons in several decay modes , targeting in particular the fully hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "many different measurements of the properties of @xmath0 hadrons have been made using samples selected by this trigger , examples of which are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , this trigger preferentially selects those events in which the decay time of the @xmath0 hadron is long .",
    "this leads to a biased proper decay time distribution .",
    "the conventional approach to correct this bias has been through the use of a full detector and trigger simulation .",
    "an important source of systematic uncertainty , inherent in this conventional approach , is how well the simulation represents the data .",
    "a full and accurate simulation of data collected by this trigger is particularly difficult due to the dependence on many variables including particle kinematics , beam - interaction positions , and the instantaneous luminosity .",
    "the differences between data and simulation are the dominant systematic uncertainties in the recent cdf measurement of the @xmath13 lifetime  @xcite .",
    "these systematic uncertainties will be the limiting factor in obtaining precision measurements of @xmath14 hadron lifetimes in data samples collected by methods that introduce a time distribution bias . in this paper",
    "we present a new analytical technique for correction of the bias induced by such a trigger .",
    "this technique uses no information from simulations of the detector or physics processes , and thus incurs none of the uncertainties intrinsic to the simulation based method .",
    "the technique is presented in a measurement of the @xmath0@xmath15 meson lifetime using the decay mode @xmath1 ( charge conjugate decays are implied throughout ) .",
    "this decay channel is chosen as the lifetime of the @xmath2 is already well known and the high yield available in this channel allows a good comparison to the world average .",
    "this measurement demonstrates the ability of this method to reduce the overall systematic uncertainty on a lifetime measurement .",
    "a displaced track trigger is expected to operate at the lhcb detector , and the technique of lifetime measurement presented here is applicable to any data where the method of collection induces a bias in the proper decay time distribution .",
    "the simulation - independent method , presented here , for removing the trigger - induced lifetime bias is based on using a candidate - by - candidate efficiency function for each @xmath0 meson candidate .",
    "this efficiency function is calculated from the event data , without recourse to simulation .",
    "this approach is based on the observation that for a given set of decay kinematics of the decay @xmath16 ( i.e the four momenta of the final state particles and the flight distance of the @xmath17 ) the decay time dependent efficiency function has a simple shape that can easily be calculated from the measured decay kinematics and the known decay time dependent cuts .",
    "this provides a simple and robust method for taking into account the effect of the trigger by calculating a different efficiency function for each candidate and applying it , candidate - by - candidate , in a likelihood fit .",
    "the details of this calculation are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : removebiasforsignal ] .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , if a candidate - by - candidate quantity ( here , the efficiency function ) enters a fit with a signal and background component , the probability density function ( pdf ) for this quantity needs to be included in the fit , unless it happens to be identical for both components . in our case , this constitutes a significant complication as it requires fitting a distribution of efficiency functions rather than just numbers .",
    "this is accomplished with an unusual application of the fisher discriminant method to translate each efficiency function into a single number , described in sec .",
    "[ sec : sgbgpdf ] .",
    "while we do not use any input from simulation in extracting the @xmath0 lifetime from the data , we do use simulated events to test our analysis method and also to evaluate systematic uncertainties .",
    "we use a full geant3-based detector simulation  @xcite , ( which includes a trigger simulation ) , as well as a detailed fast simulation for high - statistics studies .",

    "this analysis uses data corresponding to 1 fb@xmath18 of integrated luminosity collected by the cdf ii detector at the fermilab tevatron using @xmath19 collisions at @xmath12 tev .",
    "the data were collected during the first four years ( 20022006 ) of the ongoing run - ii data taking period .",
    "the cdf ii detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite . a brief description of the most relevant detector components for this analysis follows .",
    "the cdf ii detector has a cylindrical geometry with forward - backward symmetry .",
    "it includes a tracking system in a 1.4 t magnetic field , coaxial with the beam .",
    "the tracking system is surrounded by calorimeters and muon detection chambers . a cylindrical coordinate system , @xmath20 is used with origin at the geometric center of the detector , where @xmath21 is the perpendicular distance from the beam",
    ", @xmath22 is the azimuthal angle and the @xmath23 direction is in the direction of the proton beam .",
    "the polar angle @xmath24 with respect to the proton beam defines the pseudorapidity @xmath25 which is given by @xmath26 .",
    "the cdf ii detector tracking system consists of an open cell argon - ethane gas drift chamber called the central outer tracker ( cot )  @xcite , a silicon vertex microstrip detector ( svx - ii )  @xcite , and an intermediate silicon layer detector ( isl )  @xcite .",
    "the svx - ii is 96 cm long , with three sub - sections in @xmath27 and has five concentric layers of double sided silicon microstrip detectors from @xmath21=2.45 to @xmath21=10.60 cm segmented into 12 wedges in @xmath22 .",
    "the cot is 310 cm long , consisting of 96 sense wire layers grouped into eight alternating axial and 2@xmath28 stereo superlayers .",
    "the isl lies between a radius of 20.0 and 29.0 cm and helps in extending the @xmath25 coverage of the svx - ii and cot .",
    "together the svx - ii , isl , and cot provide @xmath21-@xmath22 and @xmath27 measurements in the pseudorapidity range @xmath292 or @xmath291 for tracks traversing all eight cot superlayers .",
    "a charged particle has a helical trajectory in a constant magnetic field . a description of the five parameters used to describe charged particle tracks at the cdf experiment follows . in the transverse plane ,",
    "which is the plane perpendicular to the beam direction and described by @xmath30 and @xmath31 coordinates , the helix is parametrized with track curvature @xmath32 , impact parameter @xmath33 , and azimuthal angle @xmath34 .",
    "the projection of the track helix onto the transverse plane is a circle of radius @xmath35 , and the absolute value of the track curvature is @xmath36 .",
    "the curvature is related to the magnitude of the track s transverse momentum , @xmath37 , by @xmath38 , where @xmath32 is in cm@xmath18 , @xmath0 is in tesla and @xmath37 is in gev/@xmath40 , where @xmath40 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the sign of the curvature matches the sign of the track charge .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath33 corresponds to the distance of closest approach of the track to the beam line .",
    "the sign of @xmath33 is taken to be that of @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the unit vector in the direction of the particle trajectory , @xmath43 is the direction of the vector from the primary interaction point to the point of closest approach to the beam , and @xmath23 is the unit vector in the direction of increasing @xmath27 .",
    "the angle @xmath34 is the azimuthal angle between @xmath44 and the particle momentum at closest approach .",
    "the two remaining parameters that uniquely define the helix in three dimensions are the cotangent of the angle @xmath24 between the @xmath27 axis and the momentum of the particle and @xmath45 , the position along the @xmath27 axis at the point of closest approach to the beam .",
    "the cdf ii detector hadronic @xmath0 trigger is at the heart of this analysis .",
    "it collects large quantities of hadronic @xmath0 decays , but biases the measured proper decay time distribution through its impact - parameter - based selection .",
    "the cdf ii detector has a three level trigger system .",
    "the first two levels , level 1 ( l1 ) and level 2 ( l2 ) , are implemented in hardware and the third , level 3 ( l3 ) , is implemented in software on a cluster of computers using reconstruction algorithms similar to those used offline .",
    "the cdf trigger has many different configurations of selection requirements designed to retain specific physics signatures . in this paper",
    "we refer to the family of triggers aimed at collecting samples of multi - body hadronic @xmath0 decays as the `` two track trigger '' .    at l1",
    "the trigger uses information from the extremely fast tracker ( xft )  @xcite .",
    "it requires two tracks in the cot and imposes criteria on track @xmath37 and opening angle . at l2 the silicon vertex trigger ( svt )  @xcite , which uses silicon hits and fast pattern recognition , reapplies the @xmath37 criteria , associates silicon hits with each xft track and requires that the absolute value of each track s @xmath33 lies between 120 and 1000  @xmath46 m .",
    "a determination of the beam collision point or primary vertex is continuously made by the svt during each data taking period ( defining a run ) and is used by all relevant triggers . after data taking is complete , the offline algorithm uses full detector information and fully reconstructed three dimensional tracks for a more accurate determination . at l2 additional criteria are imposed on variables calculated from each track pair found by the svt .",
    "the variables are : the product of the track charges ( opposite or same sign ) , a track fit @xmath47 quantity , the opening angle of the two tracks in the transverse plane , the scalar sum of the @xmath37 of the two tracks , and the @xmath48 , where the @xmath48 is the projection of the distance between the primary vertex and two track intersection along the direction of the sum of the two track @xmath49 .",
    "the l3 trigger uses a full reconstruction of the event with all detector information , ( although using a slightly simpler tracking algorithm than the one used offline ) and reconfirms the criteria imposed by l2 .",
    "in addition , the difference in @xmath45 of the two tracks is required to be less than 5 cm removing events where the pair of tracks originate from different collisions within the same crossing of @xmath50 and @xmath51 bunches .",
    "the impact parameter for any given track measured by the l2 ( svt ) is , in general , different from the impact parameter calculated by the l3 or offline reconstruction algorithms for the same track due to the differing algorithms .",
    "these different measurements of impact parameter are referred to in this paper as @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54from l2 ( svt ) , l3 , and offline algorithms , respectively .",
    "three different two - track trigger configurations are used in this analysis .",
    "their criteria are summarized in table  [ secdetector : tab : trigcut ] in terms of the quantities described above .",
    "it is clear that the impact parameter and @xmath48 requirements will preferentially select long - lived @xmath0 hadron decays over prompt background .",
    "the three selections are referred to as the low-@xmath37 , medium-@xmath37 and high-@xmath37 selections .",
    "this is a reference to their single track @xmath37 ( @xmath55 2.0 , 2.0 , 2.5 gev/@xmath40 , respectively ) and track pair @xmath37 scalar sum ( @xmath55 4.0 , 5.5 , 6.5 gev/@xmath40 , respectively ) selection requirements .",
    "the requirements of the three trigger selections mean that any event that passes the high-@xmath37 selection , simultaneously satisfies the requirements of the low and medium @xmath37 selections .",
    "the three separate selection criteria exist because of the need to control the high trigger acceptance rates that occur at high instantaneous luminosity due to high track multiplicity .",
    "the rates are controlled by the application of prescaling , which is the random rejection of a predefined fraction ( dependent on the instantaneous luminosity ) of events accepted by each trigger selection .",
    "therefore only the higher purity , but less efficient , high-@xmath37 selection is available to accept events at higher luminosities ."
