    "measurements of velocity fields along the coasts of oceans throughout the world show that much of the fluid energy is contained in motions with periods of a few days or longer .",
    "the comparison of measurements at different places along the same coast show that in general these low - frequency disturbances propagate along coasts with shallow water to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere .",
    "these waves have come to be known as continental shelf waves ( csws ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate , using the most straightforward model possible , the possibility of the non - propagating , trapped csws along curved coasts .",
    "the existence of such non - propagating modes would be significant as they would tend to be forced by atmospheric weather systems , which have similar periods of a few days , similar horizontal extent , and a reasonably broad spectrum in space and time .",
    "areas where such modes were trapped would thus appear to be likely to show higher than normal energy in the low frequency horizontal velocity field .",
    "the simplest models for csws take the coastal oceans to be inviscid and of constant density .",
    "both these assumptions might be expected to fail in various regions such as when strong currents pass sharp capes or when the coastal flow is strongly stratified .",
    "however for small amplitude csws in quiescent flow along smooth coasts viscous separation is negligible .",
    "similarly most disturbance energy is concentrated in the modes with the least vertical structure , which are well described by the constant density model @xcite .",
    "the governing equations are then simply the rotating incompressible euler equations .",
    "further , coastal flows are shallow in the sense that the ratio of depth to typical horizontal scale is small . expanding the rotating incompressible euler equations in powers of this ratio and retaining only the leading order terms",

    "class 2 waves are slower , low - frequency waves that vanish in the absence of depth change or in the absence of rotation .",
    "it is the class 2 waves that give csws .",
    "they have little signature in the vertical height field @xmath7 and are observed through their associated horizontal velocity fields @xcite .",
    "the class 1 waves can be removed from , by considering the ` rigid - lid ' limit , where the external rossby radius @xmath10 ( which gives the relaxation distance of the free surface ) is large compared to the horizontal scale of the motion .",

    "equation is satisfied by introducing the volume flux streamfunction defined though @xmath13 allowing to be written as the single equation @xmath14 equation is generally described as the topographic rossby - wave equation or the equation for barotropic csws .",
    "many solutions have been presented for straight coasts , where the coast lies along @xmath15 ( say ) and the depth @xmath16 is a function of @xmath2 alone ( described as rectilinear topography here ) @xcite .",
    "these have shown excellent agreement with observations of csws , as in @xcite",
    ". there has been far less discussion of non - rectilinear geometries , where either the coast or the depth profile or both are not functions of a single coordinate . yet",
    "interesting results appear .",
    "@xcite present extensive numerical integrations of a low - order spectral model of a rectangular lake with idealized topography . for their chosen depth profiles",
    "normal modes can be divided into two types : _ basin - wide modes _ which extend throughout the lake and localized _",
    "bay modes_. these bay modes correspond to the high - frequency modes found in a finite - element model of the lake of lugarno by @xcite and observed by @xcite . @xcite",
    "give a variational formulation and describe simplified quasi - analytical models that admit localized trapped bay modes .",
    "however the geometry changes in these models are large , with the sloping lower boundary terminating abruptly where it strikes a coastal wall .",
    "further @xcite notes that is invariant under conformal mappings and so any geometry that can be mapped conformally to a rectilinear shelf can not support trapped modes .",
    "the question thus arises as to whether it is only for the most extreme topographic changes that shelf waves can be trapped or whether trapping can occur on smoothly varying shelves .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to show that this is not so : trapped modes can exist on smoothly curving coasts .",
    "the geometry considered here is that of a shelf of finite width lying along an impermeable coast .",
    "thus sufficiently far from the coast the undisturbed fluid depth becomes the constant depth of the open ocean .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that at the shelf - ocean boundary of finite - width rectilinear shelves the tangential velocity component @xmath17 vanishes for waves sufficiently long compared to the shelf width .",
    "the wavelength of long propagating disturbances is proportional to their frequency which is in turn proportional to the slope of the shelf .",
    "thus it appears that for sufficiently weakly sloping shelves the tangential velocity component , i.e. the normal derivative of the streamfunction , at the shelf - ocean boundary can be made arbitrarily small . here",
    "this will be taken as also giving a close approximation to the boundary condition at the shelf - ocean boundary when this boundary is no longer straight .",
    "the unapproximated boundary condition is that the streamfunction and its normal derivative are continuous across the boundary where they match to the decaying solution of laplace s equation ( to which reduces in regions of constant depth ) .",
    "this gives a linear integral condition along the boundary .",
    "the unapproximated problem will not be pursued further here .",
    "the boundary condition at the coast is simply one of impermeability and thus on both rectilinear and curving coasts is simply that the streamfunction vanishes .",
    "now consider flows of the form @xmath18 so @xmath19 gives the spatial structure of the flow and @xmath20 its non - dimensional frequency .",
    "then @xmath21 satisfies @xmath22 where @xmath23 is normal to the shelf - ocean boundary .",
    "mathematically , we are going to study the existence of trapped modes ( i.e. , the eigenvalues either embedded into the essential spectrum or lying in the gap of the essential spectrum ) for the problem  in a curved strip .",
    "similar problems for the laplace operator have been extensively studied in the literature  either in a curved strip , or in a straight strip with an obstacle , or in a strip with compactly perturbed boundary . in the case of laplacians with dirichlet boundary conditions",
    "these problems are usually called ` quantum waveguides ' ; the neumann case is usually referred to as ` acoustic waveguides ' . the important result concerning quantum waveguides",
    "was established in @xcite , @xcite : in the curved waveguides there always exist a trapped mode .",
    "later this result was extended to more general settings ; in particular , in @xcite it was shown that in the case of mixed boundary conditions ( i.e. , dirichlet conditions on one side of the strip and neumann conditions on the other side ) trapped modes exist if the strip is curved ` in the direction of the dirichlet boundary ' .    the case of quantum waveguides",
    "is more complicated because any eventual eigenvalues are embedded into the essential spectrum and are , therefore , highly unstable .",
    "therefore , it is believed that in general the existence of trapped modes in this case is due to some sort of the symmetry of the problem ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we use the approach similar to the one used in @xcite and @xcite ; however , we have to modify this approach substantially due to the fact that we are working with a spectral problem for an operator pencil rather than that for an ordinary operator .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following way . in section 2 , we discuss the rigorous mathematical statement of the problem ; in section 3 , we study the essential spectrum , and in section 4 , state and prove the main result on the existence of a discrete spectrum ( theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "in particular we show that a trapped mode always exists of all of the following conditions are satisfied : ( a ) the depth profile @xmath16 does not depend upon the longitudinal coordinate ; ( b ) the channel is curved in the direction of the dirichlet boundary ; ( c ) the curvature is sufficiently small .",
    "similar results can be obtained in a straight strip if the depth profile @xmath16 depends nontrivially upon the longitudinal coordinate ; we however do not discuss this problem here .",
    "the original geometry is a straight planar strip of width @xmath24 : @xmath25    deformed geometry @xmath26 is assumed to be a curved planar strip of constant width @xmath24 . to describe it",
    "precisely , we introduce the curve @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is a natural arc - length parameter , i.e. , @xmath29 . by @xmath30",

    "now we can introduce , in a neighbourhood of @xmath31 , the curvilinear coordinates @xmath36 as @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is a distance from a point @xmath39 to @xmath31 ) and describe the _ deformed strip _",
    "@xmath26 in these coordinates as @xmath40    as sets of points , @xmath41 for any @xmath42 , but the metrics are different , see below .",
    "we shall often omit index @xmath42 if the metric is obvious from the context .    to avoid self - intersections , we must restrict the width of the strip by natural conditions @xmath43 finally , it is an easy computation to show that the euclidean metric in the curvilinear coordinates has a form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 later on , we shall widely use the notation @xmath46 note that in all the volume integrals , @xmath47      for a given positive continuously differentiable function @xmath48 ( describing a depth profile ) , we are looking for a function @xmath49 satisfying with spectral parameter @xmath20 .    by substituting @xmath50 and using explicit expressions for differential operators in curvilinear",

    "this leads to a special choice of weighted hilbert spaces below .",
