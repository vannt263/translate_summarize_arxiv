    "<S> we build two analytical models , the continuum field model and the halo model , to calculate the igm xrb mean flux , angular auto correlation and cross correlation with galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the igm may contribute a significant fraction to the unresolved soft xrb flux and correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we calibrated non - gaussian errors estimated against our @xmath0 moving mesh hydro simulation and estimate that the rosat all sky survey plus sloan galaxy photometric redshift survey would allow a @xmath1 accuracy in the igm xrb - galaxy cross correlation power spectrum measurement for @xmath2 and a @xmath3 accuracy in the redshift resolved x - ray emissivity - galaxy cross correlation power spectrum measurement for @xmath4 . at small scales , </S>",
    "<S> non - gravitational heating , e.g. feedback , dominates over gravity and leaves unique signatures in the igm xrb , which allows a comparable accuracy in the measurement of the amount of non - gravitational heating and the length scales where non - gravitational energy balances gravity . </S>"
