    "recently , the lattice boltzmann(lb ) method got substantial progress and has been regarded as a promising alternative for simulating many complex phenomena in various fields@xcite . unlike the macroscopic computational fluid dynamics or the microscopic molecular dynamics , the lb uses a mesoscopic discrete boltzmann equation to describe the fluid system . because of its intrinsic kinetic nature , the lb contains more physical connotation than navier - stokes or euler equations based on the continuum hypothesis@xcite . from the chapmann - enskog analysis , the latter can be derived from the former under the hydrodynamic limit .    although having achieved great success in simulating incompressible fluids , the application of lb to high - speed compressible flows still needs substantial effort .",
