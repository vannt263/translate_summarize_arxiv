    "the interaction among neutral atoms is equivalent to a range zero in the limit of @xmath2 . for identical bosonic atoms , either the efimov effect  @xcite or the thomas collapse  @xcite can happen when the ratio between @xmath0 and the range goes to infinity",
    "this is the scaling limit , where the three - boson properties can be determined just by two scales : the dimer binding energy ( or virtual dimer energy ) and the shallow trimer binding energy  @xcite .",
    "recently , bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has been obtained with trapped ultra - cold atomic gases .",
    "losses of atoms in bec can occur due to three - atom recombination processes , which are measured in several cases : @xmath3na@xmath4  @xcite , @xmath5rb@xmath4  @xcite and @xmath6rb@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the value of the three - body recombination coefficient , together with the corresponding two - body scattering length , allow us to predict the energy of the shallow trimer bound state for such systems in a trap , as we describe in sect .",
    "another aspect related to the three - body recombination process , supported by experimental observations , is a possible enhancement due to quantum coherence ( laser effect ) , which may happen in a special situation of fast changes of @xmath0 . in sect .",

    "is calculated within a renormalized scheme for three particles interacting through pairwise dirac - delta interaction  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath1 are shown to be in the interval @xmath8 for large @xmath0 .",
    "the contribution of a deep - bound state to the prediction , in the case of @xmath6rb@xmath7 , for a particular trap , is shown to be relatively small .",
    "also , using the predicted energies of the triatomic molecules in ultra - cold traps the sizes of the trimers @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be estimated . in this case",
    ", a universal scaling function gives the mean - square radii as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the root - mean - square distance between two atoms in a triatomic molecule is estimated to be 0.8@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the atomic mass  @xcite .",
    "the rate of three free bosons to recombine , forming a dimer and one remaining particle , is given in the limit of zero energy , by the recombination coefficient@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "when @xmath15 , the recombination parameter @xmath14 oscillates between zero and a maximum value , which is a function of @xmath0 , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath16 ) , @xcite ( @xmath17 ) and @xcite ( @xmath18 ) .    by using a general scaling procedure ,",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that one can express the functional dependence of @xmath14 in terms of the two and three - body energies , @xmath19 , considering that , for large scattering lengths one has @xmath20 .",
    "the scaling form of @xmath14 , with explicit @xmath21 dependence , is @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 depends on the interaction at short distances .",
    "next , considering the calculation of the scaling function , with the subtracted form of the faddeev equations  @xcite , and considering the relation between the transition matrix elements and the three - body recombination coefficient at zero energy , it was derived the functional dependence of @xmath14 in terms of the ratio @xmath25 ( see fig . 1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling limit is well approached in the calculations , with the maximum @xmath14 occurring at the threshold ( @xmath26 ) and when @xmath270.38  @xcite , such that between two consecutive maximum of @xmath14 we have @xmath28 .    using the experimental values @xmath29 , for a few atomic species @xmath30",
    ", one can obtain two possible values of the weakly bound triatomic molecular states that are consistent with the universal scaling plot that was derived . the predicted trimer",
    "binding energies are given in table 1 , in milikelvins , in respect to the threshold , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , considering the central values of the experimental dimensionless recombination parameters .",
    ".for the atomic species @xmath30 , it is shown in the 4th and 5th columns the predicted trimer binding energies , in respect to the threshold . @xmath29 and @xmath33 are respectively given in the 2nd and 3rd column .",
    "for @xmath5rb@xmath34 , the recombination process was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for noncondensed ( @xmath35 ) and condensed ( @xmath36 ) trapped atoms . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the phenomenon of enhancement in the magnitude of the three - body recombination coefficient gives an indication that may be a laser - like effect is occurring in the experiment of ref .",
    "our picture suggests that for very short time scales ( time ranges varying from 0 up to 100 @xmath37s ) the three - body recombination processes produce shallow dimers and a third atom ( burst effect ) in many - boson states .",
    "the coherent production of shallow dimers occurs for very short rise times and disappears for longer ones , producing the strange effect reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , of a decreasing dissipation from the condensate for long rise times .",
    "this effect is brought to the mean - field calculation by the enhanced values of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath38 , which can be approximately given by the parameterization @xmath39 such parametrization is convenient to study the remaining number of atoms in @xmath6rb bec as a function of the scaled rise time of the applied magnetic pulse , for fixed hold times , with the parameters considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where the magnetic field during the hold time is @xmath40 156.7 g ) .",
    "the results of our model calculation describes the observed behavior of the remaining number of atoms ( see fig .",
    "3 of ref .",
    "in the present communication , we report recent results that we have obtained by considering the three - body recombination processes in ultracold or condensed atomic gases . from the experimental values of the recombination coefficient together with the corresponding two - body scattering length , for atomic systems in a trap , we are able to predict energies of the shallow trimer bound state for a few atomic systems . to obtain the scaling function corresponding to the dependence of the dimensionless recombination parameter with the shallow trimer binding energy",
    ", we use a zero range model which is valid for large scattering lengths .",
    "we point out that , at least one experimental result for @xmath5rb@xmath41 is outside the interval of theoretical vacuum values of @xmath14 , which may indicate that some particular physics is present in that experiment .",
    "we also observe that , when considering the special situation of fast variations of the two - body scattering length , near a feshbach resonance , the experimental results can be put consistent with a mean field description , if one allows a strong enhancement of the three - body recombination process motivated by a possible quantum coherence phenomena in the production of dimers ( laser effect ) .",
    "however , certainly one has to go beyond the mean - field description with only condensed atoms , to be able to implement the coherence effect in a defined way .",
    "such a mean - field theory should describe simultaneously the dynamics of the condensed atoms , the remaining atoms and the dimers , which is within the scope of a future investigation .",
