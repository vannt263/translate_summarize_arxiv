    "much of what we know about the universe at high redshift arises from observations of the rest - frame ultraviolet emission of distant galaxies that is accessible from the ground at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "for this reason , significant effort has been devoted over the past several years to improve our understanding of the star formation history and dust attenuation in galaxies drawn from ultraviolet surveys .",
    "recent progress in this area has come mainly from studies of a sample of 57 nearby starburst galaxies , for which a wide range of observations were compiled by @xcite . in particular , for these galaxies there is a remarkably tight correlation between ratio of total far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities , , and ultraviolet spectral slope , @xmath0 , which is referred to as the ` infrared excess ( irx)-ultraviolet ( uv ) ' relation ( here @xmath0 is defined by a power - law fit of the form @xmath1 to the spectrum at wavelengths @xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite find that the  relation allows reliable estimates of the attenuation by dust at ultraviolet wavelengths , , from either  or @xmath0 .",
    "this relation , if universal , represents our best hope to estimate the attenuation by dust and hence the star formation rates of high - redshift galaxies , for which the rest - frame optical and infrared emission can not be observed at present .",
    "the main uncertainty affecting the  relation is that it has been established only for starburst galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite has compiled a small sample of nearby , more quiescent galaxies drawn from ultraviolet observations with various satellites ( here we use the term ` quiescent ' to describe the broad class of star - forming galaxies between active starburst and dormant early - type galaxies ) .",
    "his results suggest that quiescent galaxies deviate from the  relation for starburst galaxies , in the sense that quiescent galaxies tend to have ` redder ' ultraviolet spectra at fixed .",
    "this implies that the simple @xcite recipe to estimate from either  or @xmath0 may not hold for all galaxy types .",
    "the results of @xcite raise several questions . can star formation history alone account for the distribution of galaxies in the diagram ? or do the galaxies have different dust properties ? @xcite have developed a simple dust model , based on an idealized prescription of the main features of the ( clumpy ) interstellar medium ( ism ) , which allows one to interpret the  relation and the emission - line properties of starburst galaxies in terms of star formation rate and dust content .",
    "this model accounts for the different attenuation affecting young and old stars in a galaxy , because of the dispersal of the ( giant molecular ) clouds in which stars form . using this model , @xcite",
    "show that the tight  relation for starburst galaxies can be understood most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content .",
    "clearly , to gain insight into the origin of the  relation for different types of galaxies , we require further observations and modelling of not only the ultraviolet and infrared luminosities , but also other observable quantities with distinct dependences on dust content and star formation history .    in this paper , we compile a new sample of 115 nearby , non - seyfert galaxies spanning a wide range of star formation activities , from starburst to nearly dormant , to explore the physical parameters driving the location of a galaxy in the  diagram .",
    "our sample is drawn from ultraviolet observations with various satellites .",
    "we combine these observations with infrared observations and , for a subset of the galaxies , with optical spectroscopy from various sources .",
    "we examine , in particular , the 4000    spectral discontinuity and the  emission equivalent width , which are good indicators of star formation activity , and the  ratio , which is a good indicator of attenuation by dust . based on these data alone",
    ", it appears that the broadening of the relation for quiescent star - forming galaxies is most likely driven by star formation history .",
    "we combine the simple dust model of @xcite with the population synthesis code of @xcite and show that this model can account for the ultraviolet and far - infrared properties of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the model allows us to understand why the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates is the most likely ` second ' parameter that , in combination with dust content , determines the position of a galaxy in the  diagram . in section 2 below , we compile our galaxy sample and investigate the origin of the  relation from an observational viewpoint .",
    "in section 3 , we interpret the  relation using the model .",
    "we explore the implications of our results for estimates of the ultraviolet attenuation in galaxies in section4 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section5 .",
    "in this section , we re - examine the  relation from an observational viewpoint .",
    "we combine ultraviolet observations from various satellites with observations from the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) to compile a new sample of nearby , non - seyfert galaxies spanning a wide range of star formation activities in the  diagram .",
    "we explore how the position of a galaxy in this diagram depends on observable properties with distinct dependences on dust content and star formation history .",
    "we compile a new sample of nearby , non - seyfert galaxies spanning a wide range of star formation activities , using available observations with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) , the _ orbiting astronomical observatory _ ( _ oao _ ) and the _ astronomical netherlands satellite _ ( _ ans _ ) .",
    "we first extract all ( non - seyfert ) spiral , elliptical , irregular and emission - line galaxies ( classes 80 , 81 , 82 and 88 ) from the _ iue _ newly - extracted spectra ( ines version 3.0 ) archive .",
    "the spectra in this database extend over two wavelength domains , corresponding to the far- ( 11501980   ) and near - ultraviolet ( 18503350   ) spectrographs on - board _ iue_. we reject galaxies with only near - ultraviolet spectra , for which the ultraviolet spectral slope can not be measured reliably .",
    "when both the far- and near - ultraviolet spectra are available for a galaxy , we merge them to form a single ultraviolet spectrum encompassing the range from 1150 to 3350    ( the spectra usually agree to within a few percent in the overlapping region around 19001950 ) .",
    "we remove foreground galactic extinction using the dust maps of @xcite and the galactic extinction curve of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we co - add the spectra of galaxies observed multiple times to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . for the ultraviolet spectral slope to be measured with reasonable accuracy , a minimum signal - to - noise ratio per pixel of 3 is required ( see appendix ) .",
    "a total of 110 galaxies with both far- and near - ultraviolet spectra and 185 galaxies with only far - ultraviolet spectra satisfy this cut in signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we require two additional conditions to include galaxies in our final sample : that optical photometry be available to estimate the ultraviolet aperture correction , and that _ iras _ 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m observations be available to estimate the total luminosity reradiated by dust .",
    "the above sample of 295 galaxies includes the 57 starburst galaxies with optical angular diameters less than @xmath4 studied by @xcite , for which most of the concentrated ultraviolet emission could be observed within the @xmath5 _ iue _ aperture .",
    "_ iras _ 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m observations are available for 50 of the meurer et al",
    ". galaxies , which we include in our final sample . for other galaxies , reasonable ultraviolet aperture corrections may be derived as a function of the effective optical radius and morphological type ( ) . morphological types are known for _ iue _ galaxies , but effective optical radii must be obtained from independent observations .",
    "we thus cross - correlate the above sample of 238 _ iue _ galaxies not included in the @xcite sample with the data release one of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr1 ; @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", we obtain effective @xmath6-band radii for 41 galaxies ( with typical , i.e. median @xmath7 ) , for which we compute ultraviolet aperture corrections using the prescription of .",
    "the corrections vary from galaxy to galaxy , with a mean logarithmic ratio of corrected - to - observed ultraviolet fluxes of @xmath8 .",
    "only 33 of these galaxies have available _ iras _ 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m observations and can be included in our final sample .",
    "these typically have morphological types earlier than the starburst galaxies of the @xcite ( sa - sc versus sc - im , although some starburst galaxies are also present ) and similar absolute @xmath9-band magnitudes , @xmath10 ( we adopt a hubble constant @xmath11kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 ) .",
    "we supplement this sample with ( non - seyfert ) galaxies for which multi - band ultraviolet imaging with _ ans _ and _ oao _ is available from the compilation of . in the spectral range of interest to us ,",
    "the galaxies observed with _",
    "ans _ were imaged at 1550 , 1800 , 2200 and 2500   through a fixed aperture of @xmath13 .",
    "those observed with _",
    "were imaged at 1550 , 1910 and 2460   through a fixed circular aperture of @xmath14 diameter . of the 95 galaxies observed with _",
    "ans _ in the compilation , 34 have available _ iras _ 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m observations .",
    "we reject 5 galaxies with optical diameters larger than @xmath15 , for which the ultraviolet emission does not appear to be clearly concentrated within the _ ans _ aperture , and 2 galaxies with larger - aperture imaging available from _ oao _ ( see below ) .",
    "the remaining 27 galaxies have typical morphological types sb - sd and absolute @xmath9-band magnitudes similar to those of the galaxies in the _ iue _ sample , @xmath16 .",
    "of the 36 galaxies with _ oao _ imaging , 11 have available _ iras _ 25 , 60 and 100@xmath3 m observations .",
    "we reject 6 galaxies with optical diameters larger than @xmath17 .",
    "we thus retain only 5 galaxies with _ oao _ imaging in our final sample , two sc galaxies with @xmath18 , two sd galaxies with @xmath19 and an i m galaxy with @xmath20 .",
    "our final sample contains 115 galaxies with both ultraviolet and infrared data , of which 83 were observed with _ iue _ , 27 with _ ans _ and 5 with _ oao_. about half are starburst galaxies ( most belonging to the @xcite sample ) , while the other half are earlier - type , more quiescent galaxies spanning a similar range of absolute @xmath9-band magnitudes .",
    "we compute ultraviolet spectral slopes for all the galaxies in our sample . @xcite",
    "define the ultraviolet spectral slope @xmath0 by a power - law fit of the form @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the flux per unit wavelength ) to the spectrum in ten continuum bands in the range @xmath23   .",
    "we can not use this definition here , because it does not apply to galaxies for which only multi - band ultraviolet imaging is available .",
    "instead , we adopt the following definition of the ultraviolet spectral slope for all the galaxies in our sample , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the effective wavelengths of the far- ( 13501800   ) and near - ultraviolet ( 18003000   ) filters on board the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ , @xcite ) , and  and are the mean flux densities ( per unit wavelength ) through these filters . in the appendix , we use a reference sample of 110 _ iue _ spectra to calibrate the conversions between  and the ultraviolet spectral slopes estimated from observations with different satellites .",
    "we show that , in particular , ultraviolet spectral slopes estimated from _",
    "ans _ and _ oao _ imaging observations can be converted into  with an rms uncertainty of only @xmath27 .",
    "this is similar to the uncertainty introduced in  by the lack of near - ultraviolet spectra for some _ iue _ galaxies in our sample .",
    "for all the galaxies in our sample , we compute the ultraviolet flux as @xmath28 , as described in the appendix .    to estimate the total far - infrared flux @xmath29 from the observed _ iras _ flux densities @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we appeal to the recent prescription of @xcite .",
    "this is based on model fits to the spectra of a large sample of nearby , normal ( i.e. non - seyfert ) star - forming galaxies across the whole wavelength range from 3 to 850@xmath3 m .",
    "we use equation  ( 5 ) of dale & helou to compute @xmath29 ( @xmath33 in their notation ) from @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath32 . for reference , for the _ iue _ starburst galaxies in our sample , the values of @xmath29 computed in this way are typically 50% larger than those estimated by @xcite from only @xmath35 and @xmath36 using the older prescription of helou et al .",
    "( 1988 ; see also @xcite ) . neglecting possible anisotropies ( section4 ) , we equate the ratio of total far - infrared to ultraviolet fluxes @xmath37 to the corresponding luminosity ratio .",
    "fig.[irx ] shows  as a function of  for the 115 galaxies in our sample .",
    "different symbols distinguish the 50 starburst galaxies studied by meurer et al .",
    "( 1999 , solid dots ) and the ( typically more quiescent ) galaxies observed with _",
    "iue_+sdss ( stars ) , _ ans _ ( open triangles ) and _ oao _ ( filled triangles ) . to a first , rough approximation ,  is a function of  for the whole sample . as found previously by meurer et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1999 ) , the two quantities are tightly correlated for starburst galaxies , for which the typical scatter at fixed  amounts to a factor of less than 2 in .",
    "the main novelty introduced by the inclusion of more quiescent galaxies in our sample is an increase of the scatter to a factor of more than 3 toward lower   values at fixed .",
    "lies substantially above the  relation for starburst galaxies .",
    "this is not unexpected , since our sample of galaxies drawn from ultraviolet surveys ( with typical infrared luminosities @xmath38 ) does not include ` luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies ' , which tend to have larger than starburst galaxies at fixed  ( presumably because of the heavy obscuration of the sources of ultraviolet radiation ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "the effect is real , as the observational scatter is much larger than the typical ( i.e. median ) measurement errors ( which are shown in the lower right corner of fig.[irx ] ) .",
    "we note that the _ shape _ of the  relation does not appear to be affected by the inclusion of quiescent galaxies in our sample .",
    "what are the main physical parameters driving the relation between ultraviolet spectral slope and ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities for star - forming galaxies ?",
    "@xcite show that , for starburst galaxies , the tight relation between  and  can be understood most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies .",
    "the inclusion of quiesent star - forming galaxies in fig.[irx ] reveals that a ` second parameter ' tends to broaden the relation .",
    "we may begin by identifying this second parameter as the perpendicular distance from the mean  relation for starburst galaxies .",
    "following @xcite , we define the mean relation for starburst galaxies by a least - squares fit of the type @xmath39 to the observations of the 50 starburst galaxies in our sample .",
    "the result is shown by the solid line in fig.[irx ] .",
    "we can compute the perpendicular ( i.e. shortest ) distance  from each point in the  diagram to this line .",
    "we adopt the convention of negative  for galaxies with  lower than the mean value for starburst galaxies at fixed  ( see fig.[irx ] ) .",
    "we expect the second parameter affecting the  relation to be connected to star formation history , since the relation becomes broader when quiescent star - forming galaxies are considered in addition to starburst galaxies .",
    "it is thus natural to explore how observed quantities with different dependences on the star formation history correlate with .",
    "we first consider the 4000 spectral discontinuity index , defined as the ratio of the average flux densities in the narrow bands 38503950   and 40004100   ( @xcite ) .",
    "this index depends somewhat on metallicity but correlates more with the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates in galaxies , and hence , it is a valuable indicator of the history of star formation ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , the narrowness of the bands used to compute  makes it largely insensitive to attenuation by dust .",
    "medium - resolution spectra ( 39 fwhm ) of 64 galaxies in our sample ( 35 starburst and 29 quiescent star - forming ) are available from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "fig.[dpobs]a shows  measured from these spectra as a function of the perpendicular distance  from the mean starburst  relation .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient is @xmath40 , indicating that the correlation between  and  is significant at the @xmath41 level for this sample size .",
    "this result is remarkable , as it is direct observational evidence that star formation history is relevant to the second parameter affecting the  relation .",
    "another observable quantity that is sensitive to the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates is the  emission equivalent width  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is the ratio of the   emission - line luminosity produced by young massive stars to the continuum luminosity per unit wavelength produced by older stars at @xmath42 . in fig.[dpobs]b",
    ", we show as a function of  for 59 galaxies ( 31 starburst and 28 quiescent star - forming ) in our sample ( we adopt the convention of positive equivalent width for emission ) .",
    "the  emission equivalent widths were measured from the same optical spectra as above following the procedure outlined in section2 of @xcite , which allows accurate correction for stellar absorption .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient in this case is @xmath43 , indicating that the correlation between  and  is significant at the @xmath44 level for the sample size .",
    "we note that dust can reduce  through the absorption of ionizing photons . however , the effect is modest for quiescent star - forming galaxies , typically only 2030 per cent , and can not account for the trend seen in fig.[dpobs]b ( @xcite ) .",
    "taken together , figs[dpobs]a and b show that two different tracers of the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates ,  and , correlate with .",
    "this is strong evidence that the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates could be the second parameter affecting the  relation .    in an attempt to further understand the relative influence of star formation history and attenuation by dust on the  relation , we plot other properties of the galaxies against  in figs[dpobs]c and d : the ratio of the _ iras _ @xmath31 and @xmath32 flux densities and the ratio of the  and  emission line luminosities .",
    "the 60100ratio , available for all 115 galaxies in our sample , depends on the relative contributions by young and old stars to dust heating in a galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is an indirect tracer of the star formation history that also depends on the dust content ( and potentially the spatial distribution of dust relative to stars ) .",
    "the  ratio , available for 48 galaxies ( 29 starburst and 19 quiescent star - forming ) from the same optical spectra as above , is strongly sensitive to attenuation by dust but not to the past history of star formation .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficients are @xmath45 for the relation between 60100  and  and @xmath46 for that between  and . for the different numbers of galaxies in each case",
    ", this implies that the correlation between 60100  and  is significant at the @xmath44 level , while there appears to be little or no correlation between  and .",
    "these findings reinforce our contention that the second parameter affecting the  relation is primarily star formation history rather than dust content .",
    "based on the observational evidence above , we conclude that , while dust content is the primary driver of the relation for starburst galaxies , the broadening of the relation for quiescent star - forming galaxies is most likely driven by star formation history , and in particular the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates . in the next section , we show that this observational result can be understood in the framework of a simple model for the production of starlight and its transfer through the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies .",
    "in this section , we explore the physical origin of the  relation from a more theoretical standpoint . we appeal to a simple model for the production of starlight and its transfer through the interstellar medium in galaxies .",
    "the model is based on a combination of the @xcite population synthesis code and the @xcite prescription for the absorption of starlight by dust .",
    "the charlot & fall model relies on an idealized description of the main features of the ism .",
    "stars are assumed to form in interstellar ` birth clouds ' ( i.e. giant molecular clouds ) .",
    "after @xmath47yr , young stars disrupt their birth clouds and migrate into the ` ambient ism ' .",
    "the ` effective absorption ' curve describing the attenuation of photons emitted in all directions by stars of age @xmath48 in a galaxy is given by the simple formula @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the total effective @xmath51-band optical depth seen by young stars .",
    "the adjustable parameter @xmath3 defines the fraction of the total effective absorption optical depth contributed by the ambient interstellar medium ( @xmath52 on average , with substantial scatter ) .",
    "in addition , a fraction @xmath53 of the effective absorption optical depth @xmath54 of the birth clouds is assumed to arise from the  regions ionized by young stars in the inner parts of these clouds .",
    "we note that , in the case of optically thick birth clouds , the ultraviolet radiation escaping from a galaxy is produced by stars older than @xmath55yr , while the total far - infrared luminosity is produced by stars of all ages .",
    "@xcite used their model to interpret the relations between ultraviolet spectral slope , ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and  ratio for the starburst galaxies in the @xcite sample ( section  2 ) .",
    "they showed that the finite lifetime of the birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving the apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum radiation in these galaxies .",
    "they also showed that the  relation can be understood most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies .",
    "for simplicity , @xcite",
    "limited their study to models with constant star formation rates and young ages , as appropriate to interpret observations of starburst galaxies .",
    "the results of section2 above suggest that star formation history plays an important role in defining the  relation for more quiescent galaxies . to investigate the dependence of the   relation on star formation history , we assume that the star formation rate varies with time as @xmath56 from @xmath57 to the present galaxy age @xmath58 .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 is the inverse time - scale of star formation . for simplicity ,",
    "all models are assumed for the moment to have fixed solar metallicity .",
    "our main goal is to identify the model parameter that most simply accounts for the offset of normal , quiescent star - forming galaxies from the mean  relation for starburst galaxies in fig.[irx ] . to do this",
    ", we must explore the influence of each primary model parameter ( , @xmath59 ,  and @xmath3 ) on observable quantities available for galaxies in our sample , i.e. the ultraviolet spectral slope , the ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the 4000 discontinuity .",
    "the influence of  and @xmath3 on  and  can be inferred from the results presented in figure2 of @xcite : these parameters , in particular the effective dust absorption optical depth in the ambient ism , @xmath60 , control the position of a galaxy _ along _ the  relation .",
    "the narrow - band spectral index  is only weakly sensitive to variations in  and @xmath3 ( section2 ) .",
    "we find that the influence of the star formation history on the  relation through the parameters  and @xmath59 is best described in terms of the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates .",
    "this is defined by @xmath61 for the expression of @xmath62 in equation  ( [ sfr ] ) , we have @xmath63 for reference , a galaxy with constant star formation rate ( @xmath64 ) has @xmath65 at all ages .",

    "the sequences are plotted as solid lines at ages when the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates is larger than @xmath69 and as dashed lines at greater ages , down to @xmath70 . from @xmath65 ( age @xmath57 ) to @xmath69 , the distance from the mean starburst relation increases as @xmath71 decreases along the model sequences , models with @xmath72 occupying regions of the diagram populated by more quiescent galaxies .",
    "this behavior arises mainly from an increase in  as @xmath71 decreases .",
    "models with @xmath73 are dominated by stellar populations with intrinsically redder spectra and hence larger ultraviolet spectral slopes than starburst galaxies .",
    "we note that , for @xmath74 , all models in fig.[irxbpar]a follow a similar path in the  diagram . for @xmath75 , the evolution in the  diagram",
    "depends more strongly on the adopted time - scale of star formation . at fixed @xmath71 ,  is larger in models with short time - scales of star formation ( large @xmath59 ) , which contain a smaller proportion of ultraviolet - bright stars than models with extended star formation . in this @xmath71 range ,",
    "increases at late ages because of the contribution to dust heating by the optical radiation from old stars ( section4 ) .",
    "we note that models with small @xmath71 ` returning ' at late ages to the mean relation for starburst galaxies are considerably fainter than starburst galaxies and have intrinsically red optical spectra .",
    "the similarity for @xmath76 between models with different @xmath59 in the  diagram prompts us to plot , in fig.[irxbpar]b ,  as a function of  for sequences of models with different dust content ( i.e. different ) , for two ratios of present to past - averaged star formation rates , @xmath77 and 0.3 . for simplicity , we assume that the fraction of the total effective absorption optical depth contributed by the ambient ism is fixed at the standard value @xmath68 in all models .",
    "the striking result of fig.[irxbpar]b is that the model sequences with constant @xmath71 are remarkably parallel to the mean  relation for starburst galaxies , the @xmath69 sequence being offset toward the region of the diagram populated by quiescent star - forming galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the observational evidence from figs[dpobs]a and b that , while dust content is the primary driver of the  relation , the broadening of the relation for quiescent star - forming galaxies is most likely driven by star formation history .",
    "this result does not depend on the specific combination of @xmath59 and @xmath78 used to compute models with @xmath69 in fig.[irxbpar]b .",
    "we find that , for @xmath79 , sequences of models with different dust content are also parallel to the mean  relation for starburst galaxies .",
    "however , as expected from fig.[irxbpar]a , the location of the sequences in this @xmath71range depends sensitively on the choices of @xmath59 and @xmath78 ( see also section4 ) .",
    "figs[irxbpar]a and b suggest that models with simple continuous star formation histories can not easily reproduce the observations of galaxies lying at the largest perpendicular distances from the mean starburst  relation in our sample , unless very short time - scales of star formation ( @xmath80 ) and very small ratios of present to past - averaged star formation rates ( @xmath81 ) are invoked .",
    "such parameters are not typical of quiescent star - forming galaxies . in fig.[irxbpar]c",
    ", we show  as a function of   for models with a star formation time - scale parameter @xmath82 , more typical of a spiral galaxy , which undergo an extra burst of star formation of duration @xmath83yr at the age of 6gyr , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we show the time evolution of these models for bursts representing 3 , 10 and 30 per cent of the total mass of stars formed by the continuous model over 13.5gyr .",
    "when the burst starts , each model first joins the mean  relation for starburst galaxies . shortly after the burst ends ,  and hence  drop rapidly because of the dispersal of the ( optically thick ) birth clouds of the last stars formed during the burst .",
    "then ,  and  increase again as the ultraviolet light from these stars fades and reddens .",
    "a maximum in  is reached about 0.51gyr after the burst ended .",
    "the subsequent evolution toward smaller , as the underlying continuous star formation again starts to dominate the production of the ultraviolet light , is remarkable for two reasons .",
    "first , it is very slow , implying that the models spend several gigayears in the region of the diagram populated by galaxies far away from the mean starburst   relation .",
    "second , the @xmath71 parameter is only slightly lower than that of the undisturbed continuous model and hence typical of quiescent star - forming galaxies ( note that this conserves the trend of decreasing @xmath71 with increasing distance from the mean starburst relation ) .",
    "thus , models including minor bursts of star formation on top of continuous star formation histories can account in a natural way for the observations of galaxies at large distances from the mean starburst relation in the  diagram .",
    "the simple model described above provides a natural framework for understanding the physical origin of the  diagram . as shown in fig.[irxbpar ] , this model can account for the observational evidence from section2 that , while dust content is the primary driver of the  relation for starburst galaxies , the broadening of the relation for quiescent star - forming galaxies is most likely driven by star formation history , and in particular the @xmath71 parameter .",
    "these results do not depend sensitively on the population synthesis code used for computing the production of starlight in the model .",
    "we have checked that adopting the pgase population synthesis code (; version 2.0 ) instead of the @xcite code has a negligible influence on the results of fig.[irxbpar ] .",
    "it is worth noting that other effects , such as anisotropic emission from galaxies and spatial distribution of the dust , can potentially affect the positions of galaxies in the  diagram .",
    "the inclination angles available for 59 quiescent star - forming galaxies observed with _",
    "iue_+sdss , _ ans _ and _ oao _ in our sample span the full range from 0 to 90 degrees and do not exhibit any specific trend with perpendicular distance from the mean  starburst relation .",
    "therefore , we do not expect orientation effects to play a major role in the broadening of the  relation for these galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that , for some combinations of optical properties and spatial distributions of the dust in their model , it is possible to produce  ratios lower than observed for starburst galaxies at large ultraviolet spectral slopes .",
    "however , the results in their figures 6 and 13 indicate that such models could not account for the low ratios of quiescent star - forming galaxies with small  in our sample .",
    "changes in the spatial distribution of the dust also do not provide a natural explanation for the strong drop in  equivalent width with increasing distance from the mean starburst  relation in fig.[dpobs]b ( see figure 6c of @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that , although orientation and dust geometry may have minor effects on the positions of galaxies in the  diagram , they do not seem responsible for the overall broadening of the  relation for quiescent star - forming galaxies in our sample .",
    "this broadening can be most simply understood as a sequence in the star formation histories of the galaxies .",
    "the results presented in the previous sections have important implications for estimates of the ultraviolet attenuation  and hence of star formation rates in galaxies . @xcite",
    "derive simple formulae for estimating  from either the ultraviolet spectral slope or the ratio of far - infrared to ultraviolet luminosities on the basis of the tight  relation for starburst galaxies .",
    "the results of sections2 and 3 above suggest that these formulae can not be straightforwardly applied to more quiescent galaxies .",
    "we can use the model described in section3 to estimate the accuracy to which  can be constrained in galaxies of different types . a way to assess",
    "this is to investigate the relations between ,  and  for a library of models encompassing a wide range of physically plausible star formation histories and dust contents .",
    "we thus generate a library of monte carlo realizations of different star formation histories similar to that used by @xcite to interpret the  and index strengths of a complete sample of over @xmath84 sdss galaxies .",
    "the main requirement for the model library is to include broad enough ranges of star formation histories and dust contents to ensure a wide coverage of the  diagram .",
    "we have checked that the results presented below do not depend sensitively on the detailed parametrization of the models . for simplicity , we follow @xcite and parametrize each star formation history in terms of two components : an underlying continuous model with a star formation law given by equation  ( [ sfr ] ) , and random bursts superimposed on this continuous model . over the interval from 0 to 1  gyr@xmath12 .",
    "random bursts occur with equal probability at all times until .",
    "they are parametrized in terms of the ratio between the mass of stars formed in the burst and the total mass of stars formed by the continuous model over the time .",
    "the ratio is taken to be distributed logarithmically from 0.03 to 4.0 . during a burst ,",
    "stars form at a constant rate for a time distributed uniformly in the range @xmath85@xmath86 years .",
    "the burst probability is set so that 50 per cent of the galaxies in the library have experienced a burst in the past 2 gyr ( see @xcite ) . ] for the purpose of the present analysis , we retain only models with ratios of present to past - averaged star formation rates larger than 0.03 . for the attenuation by dust ,",
    "we adopt a broad distribution of  with a peak around 1.5 and a broad distribution in @xmath3 with a peak around 0.3 .",
    "this is consistent with the dust properties derived from the  ratios and broad - band optical magnitudes of the above sample of @xmath84 sdss galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we distribute our models logarithmically in metallicity from 0.1 to 2 times solar .",
    "our final library consists of 95,000 different models .",
    "fig.[modelib ] shows  as a function of  for these models . in the upper panel , we have divided the  plane into bins and coded each bin with a different colour to reflect the average ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates of the simulated galaxies that fall into it . as found in section3 above",
    ", sequences of galaxies with different dust contents corresponding to different @xmath71 lie parallel to the mean  relation for starburst galaxies . in the lower panel of fig.[modelib ] , we have coded each bin in the  plane with a different colour to reflect the average ultraviolet attenuation  for the galaxies that fall into it .",
    "it is remarkable that sequences of models with different star formation histories corresponding to different  are nearly perpendicular to the @xmath87-axis in this diagram .",

    ", we have explored functional fits of in terms of these parameters using the models in our library .",
    "we find that the dependence of  on  is well approximated by two linear relations with a change in slope at some characteristic turn - around point ( corresponding to @xmath88 ) .",

    "the accuracy of the  estimates obtained from this formula depends on whether or not independent information is available on the ratio of present to past - averaged star formation rates .",
