    "this work is motivated by two technology trends in wireless cellular networks  @xcite : direct _ device - to - device ( d2d ) _ communications  @xcite and _ machine - type communications ( mtc ) _ or _ machine - to - machine ( m2 m ) _ communications  @xcite .",
    "d2d communication refers to the direct links between the wireless devices using the same spectrum and air interface as in cellular communications .",
    "m2 m involves a large number of low - rate low - power _ machine - type devices ( mtds ) _ , attached to the cellular network , enabling various applications , such as asset / health monitoring , smart grid communications , large - scale environmental sensing , etc .",
    "recently , several potential synergies between d2d and m2 m have been investigated  @xcite , aiming to increase the spectral reuse , range and coverage . in  @xcite these synergies where explored in the context of group - based operations , i.e. of a d2d - enabled cellular device that acts as a clusterhead for a group of mtds . in the uplink",
    "the clusterhead aggregates and forwards the gathered requests , data packets and status information from mtc devices to the connected 3gpp base station ( bs ) . in the downlink , the cluster head relays management messages and data packets from the bs to the mtds in the group .",
    "the use of d2d communications reduces the signaling congestion on the air interface and the network management load , which goes in - line with the spirit of the group - based management defined by 3gpp  @xcite . in  @xcite it",
    "was considered how direct communication within a cluster of devices can improve the performance of a conventional cellular system , by leveraging the selection between direct d2d and infrastructure relaying . in  @xcite ,",
    "the impact of the mtds on the cellular network is mitigated by randomly deploying data collectors to gather the traffic from the mtds . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors use a queueing model and coalition game formulation to analyze a scenario where the mtds are able to transmit to a macro or small - cell bs , or perform relay transmission .",
    "one of the observation was that the overall throughput of the mtds is higher if they have a low duty cycle .",
    "standardization considers d2d under the name proximity services ( prose )  @xcite , where among several other use cases , it highlights the use case in which a cellular device improves the coverage by acting as a relay on behalf of one or more other cellular devices that are outside the network range . from architecture viewpoint , d2d relaying in prose is referred to as _ range extension _ and is specific to public safety use cases  @xcite .",
    "the report  @xcite , besides providing design aspects for the physical and the upper layers , it also states that one of the requirements is the support of a large number of concurrently participating prose - enabled users .",
    ", receives simultaneously , in the same time and frequency resource , the transmissions from the base station @xmath0 and from the machine - type devices @xmath7 associated with @xmath1 .",
    "the black devices are mtds whose signals are not decoded by @xmath1 and create background non - cancelable interference to @xmath1 . ]",
    "a motivating scenario for this work is the one in which one or multiple mtds are attached to the cellular network through a d2d connection to a more capable device .",
    "for example , one can think health sensors as mtds that are attached to the body and should supply data to the cellular network about the monitored user .",
    "each sensor is capable to communicate directly with the cellular infrastructure ; however , if the person has a smartphone at disposal , the sensor uses a d2d link to transmit the data to the smartphone .",
    "speaking in more general terms , in our scenario , the d2d link is used by an m2 m device to send uplink traffic to another , more capable device .",
    "the latter may aggregate the m2 m traffic from one or multiple m2 m devices and then send it in the uplink to the bs .",
    "the architecture in which the m2 m traffic is locally aggregated to a more capable device rather than being sent directly over a wide - area connection has at least two advantages .",
    "first , the uplink power can be lowered .",
    "second , there are less m2 m devices that contend directly to get uplink resources at the bs .",
    "the latter is important if we consider a massive number of m2 m devices in a single cell , such that they can not be served if activated approximately at the same time .",
    "however , using d2d links and traffic aggregation , the resource sharing occurs locally , among a relatively lower number of m2 m devices .",
    "[ fig : scenario ] depicts out the network - assisted d2d solution scenario  @xcite , which enables concurrent use of the same communication resource by mtds and normal cellular devices .",
    "the m2 m connection is assumed to have a fixed , low rate @xmath3 .",
    "we also consider downlink traffic that is sent simultaneously with the d2d transmission .",
    "the downlink traffic is not necessarily a m2 m traffic and therefore the rate is adaptable , aiming to maximize the downlink throughput according with the channel conditions .",
    "our scenario combines the following four aspects in a d2d setting : ( 1 ) the underlay of _ downlink _ cellular communications  @xcite ; ( 2 ) the use of interference cancellation techniques  @xcite ; ( 3 ) the use of d2d to support a fixed and _ low - rate m2 m _",
    "connection  @xcite and ( 4 ) considers the case of partially available channel state information at the transmitter ( csit )  @xcite .    we show that , despite the activation of the mtds transmission and the fact that the interfering channel @xmath8 is not known , it is still possible for the bs @xmath0 to select a positive downlink rate for the cellular link @xmath4 that experiences zero outage . in other words ,",
    "the downlink signal is always decoded by @xmath1 , regardless of the strength of the interfering channel from @xmath7 to @xmath1 .",
    "the most interesting aspect of it is that @xmath0 only needs to know the instantaneous channel @xmath4 , but it does not need to know anything about the channel @xmath8 , not even the channel statistics .",
    "we show that @xmath0 needs only to know the mtd rate @xmath3 , which is assumed fixed and a priori known by all .",
    "intuitively , this is possible because , for fixed @xmath3 , if the link @xmath8 is weak , then the interference from @xmath7 is treated as noise , but if it is very strong , then the signal from @xmath7 is decoded by @xmath1 and thus the interference cancelled .",
    "the maximal zero - outage downlink rate occurs in the transition between these two regimes .",
    "we first consider the full decoding region of a multiple access channel , referred to as joint - user decoding ( jd ) , and prove a closed - form formula of the maximal zero - outage downlink rate when there are @xmath2 mtds attached to @xmath1 .",
    "for the special case @xmath5 , we also consider a simpler , single - user decoding ( sd ) , where @xmath1 needs to use only single - user decoding .",
    "this work is a generalization of the scenario first presented in  @xcite , where the m2 m and d2d coexistence was analyzed in a different network topology and assumptions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : systemmodel ] we present the system model , followed by section  [ sec : zerooutagerateupperbound ] , where we derive the maximal zero outage downlink rate in both jd and sd . in section  [ sec : performanceanalysis ] , we provide analytical bounds and approximations for the performance metrics using stochastic geometry tools . in section  [ sec : numerical results ] , we provide the comparison between the analytical bounds and approximations and the monte carlo simulations results .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "[ fig : scenario ] depicts the scenario , focused on the cellular user @xmath1 that receives downlink traffic from a bs denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "there are @xmath2 mtds associated with @xmath1 s transmission .",
    "] , denoted by @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "each device transmits to @xmath1 during the downlink transmission of @xmath0 , such that @xmath1 observes a multiple access channel ( mac ) with @xmath11 transmitters : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the complex gains of the channels @xmath4 and @xmath15 , respectively . @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "are given respectively by the circular zero - mean gaussian complex signal transmitted by the @xmath0 , @xmath18 and @xmath9 nodes , such that the respective variances are @xmath19 = p_b$ ] and @xmath20 = p_{m}$ ] , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 represent the constant power levels used by @xmath0 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath23 is a complex gaussian variable that contains the noise as well as the gaussian - approximated interference from the other mtds not associated with @xmath1 .",
    "we assume @xmath24=\\tilde{\\sigma}^2 $ ] and in section  [ sec : performanceanalysis ] we will explicitly address the modeling of the interference .    the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath25 for the signal transmitted from node @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , to @xmath1 is defined as @xmath28 the channel coefficient @xmath29 contains the path loss and the fading , and where @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "all links are assumed to be non - line - of - sight and characterized by block rayleigh fading , such that both the channel fading gains and aggregated interference do not vary during a slot in which a single packet is sent .",
    "the model of the path loss and fading is presented in section  [ sec : performanceanalysis ] .",
    "all transmissions have normalized bandwidth of @xmath32 hz , therefore the time duration can be measured in number of symbols .",
    "all transmitters use capacity - achieving gaussian codebooks , such that if a link has a snr of @xmath33 in a given slot , then the maximal achievable rate is @xmath34 similarly , for a given rate @xmath35 we can compute the minimal required snr @xmath36 that the link should have in order for the receiver to decode the signal successfully in absence of other interfering signals .",
    "this is given as : @xmath37 the downlink rate @xmath38 can be adapted from slot to slot , while each mtd uses always a constant rate @xmath3 .",
    "when there is no danger of causing confusion and for the sake of brevity , we will sometimes refer to @xmath36 as `` rate '' .",
    "further , we will denote the snr of the @xmath9 mtd simply as @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 knows the instantaneous channel state information ( csi ) of the @xmath4 link , represented by the knowledge of @xmath40 .",
    "the most interesting assumption is that @xmath0 does not have any knowledge of the channel realization or channel statistics of the link @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath0 only knows the rate @xmath3 employed by the mtds , which can be expressed as @xmath41 .",
    "we note that @xmath1 estimates the channel realizations from all links associated with the transmissions that it decodes , i.e. @xmath1 has csi at the receiver , obtained through e.g. unique preambles of the transmitting mtds and @xmath0 .",
    "we start with the case @xmath5 and show how to select the maximal downlink rate @xmath38 , for given @xmath40 , such that the signal sent from the @xmath0 experiences zero - outage , i.e. @xmath1 is able to decode it with probability @xmath32 , regardless of the interference caused by the mtds .",
    "the intuition why such a rate exists can be explained as follows .",
    "if the interference from @xmath42 is weak , then @xmath43 is low and this interference should be treated as noise . as @xmath43 grows while @xmath3 ( i.e. @xmath44 ) stays fixed , then the mtd signal becomes decodable , such that it can be removed .",
    "hence , there are two operating regimes for the decoder at @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that @xmath0 can always select a positive rate @xmath38 that does not result in outage , although @xmath0 does not even know the operating regime of the decoder of @xmath1 .",
    "we denote this decoding setting as joint user decoding ( jd ) .    in a model of a standard multiple access channel ( mac )",
    "the assumption is that the receiver should decode successfully the signals of all the transmitters . in our case",
    ", @xmath1 is the receiver of two signals with rates @xmath38 and @xmath45 , such that the mac inequalities are : @xmath46    : ( a ) is decoded while treating the mtd transmission as noise ; ( b ) is jointly decoded with the transmission from the mtd ; ( c ) is decoded in the presence of noise , after the transmission from the mtd has been decoded and subtracted from the composite signal . ]",
    "our objective is different from a standard mac treatment , since @xmath3 is fixed and we need to analyze the decodability of @xmath38 , regardless of whether @xmath3 is decodable .",
    "[ fig : jdregime ] depicts the three working regimes of the joint decoder .",
    "if @xmath47 , then the first inequality in ( [ eq : macinequalities ] ) is violated , such that the signal from @xmath42 is treated as noise and the maximal achievable downlink rate is : @xmath48 on the other hand , when @xmath49 then there are two options : ( a ) either continue to treat the signal from @xmath42 as noise and use  ( [ eq : treatgmasnoise ] ) to determine the maximal @xmath38 or ( b ) employ the mac inequalities  ( [ eq : macinequalities ] ) , which leads to the following : @xmath50 however , note that if for given @xmath49 the expression  ( [ eq : treatgmasnoise ] ) leads to a higher bound on @xmath38 compared to  ( [ eq : decodegm ] ) , then @xmath1 should treat the signal from @xmath42 as noise ( but we will see that this is not the case ) . with a slight abuse of notation , we can define @xmath51 as the maximal achievable @xmath38 for given @xmath52 , which can then be written compactly as : @xmath53     when using joint user decoding ( jd ) given known @xmath40 that does not put the @xmath4 link in outage . ]",
    "[ fig : rateregionjd_pob ] depicts how this function looks like . when @xmath54 , @xmath55 decreases , since a larger @xmath52 means a larger noise , corresponding to regime depicted in figure  [ fig : jdregime](a ) .",
    "after @xmath43 reaches @xmath44 , @xmath55 starts to increase , corresponding to regime depicted in figure  [ fig : jdregime](b ) .",
    "finally , when the link @xmath56 becomes too strong @xmath57 , the downlink rate reaches its maximal possible value @xmath58 where the interference effect from @xmath56 vanishes , corresponding to regime depicted in figure  [ fig : jdregime](c ) .",

    "now let @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath66 implies : @xmath67 furthermore , @xmath68 where both ( a ) and ( b ) follow from @xmath49 . from ( [ eq : cgammabvsnoise1 ] ) and ( b ) in ( [ eq : cgammab - gammamvsnoise ] ) it follows that : @xmath69 while from @xmath70 and ( a ) in ( [ eq : cgammab - gammamvsnoise ] ) it follows that : @xmath71 we have thus proved that @xmath72 is always decodable , regardless of the value of @xmath52 . on the other hand , from (",

    "it is easily checked that @xmath74 is continuous , since if @xmath52 is treated as noise , the achievable rate for @xmath75 is @xmath72 .",
    "a final remark is in order .",
    "the previous lemma shows that it is possible for @xmath1 to decode the signal from @xmath0 , but it only indirectly focuses on _ how _ @xmath1 does it .",
    "we refer again to the three regions on fig .",
    "[ fig : rateregionjd_pob ] .",
    "when @xmath76 , @xmath1 treats the signal from @xmath42 as noise .",
    "when @xmath77 , @xmath1 jointly decodes the signals from @xmath0 and @xmath42 and this is arguably the most complex regime of operation ; we will therefore consider a simplified receiver in section  [ sec : successiveuserdecoding ] .",
    "finally , when @xmath78 , @xmath1 decodes first the signal from @xmath42 , subtracts it , and proceeds to decode the signal of @xmath0 using single - user decoding . note that it is not necessary for @xmath0 to be aware in which decoding regime does @xmath1 operate , it only matters that @xmath1 can decode @xmath38 .      when multiple mtds are associated with a single device @xmath1",
    ", then @xmath1 observes a multiple access channel of @xmath79 users .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the insights of the proof for the case @xmath5 in order to state and prove the maximal downlink rate @xmath38 that can always be decoded by @xmath1 , irrespective of the instantaneous channel gains @xmath80 .    in order to provide an intuition ,",
    "let us assume that there are @xmath81 mtds with @xmath52 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "both mtds transmit by using the same rate @xmath83 .",
    "if both snrs are very low , such that @xmath47 and @xmath84 , then both signals should be treated as noise , such that the maximal achievable rate for @xmath38 would be @xmath85 let both snrs increase and reach @xmath86 .",
    "then one might think , following the argument in the proof of lemma  [ prop : gammab_jud ] , that this is the point where both mtd signals become decodable .",
    "this would lead to a rate @xmath87 which should be the desired rate with zero outage .",
    "however , this argument is flawed .",
    "the reason is that in the multiple access channel consisting of @xmath42 and @xmath88 there are three inequalities that need to be satisfied in order to have both signals decoded .",
    "the third inequality is : @xmath89 the reader can easily check that this is violated when @xmath86 .",
    "hence , we need to look for the minimal value of @xmath38 by considering the joint decodability of both signals . in order to satisfy ( [ eq : thirdinequalitym1m2 ] ) with equality , the following needs to hold : @xmath90 thus , if we set @xmath91 , then all three inequalities of the multiple access channel ( with @xmath42 and @xmath88 as transmitters ) are satisfied .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that the maximal downlink rate that has zero probability of outage is specified by @xmath92 this conjecture is proved in its general form through the following theorem :    [ thm : gammab_nm>1 ] let there be @xmath2 mtds , each sending at rate @xmath3 and @xmath25 is the snr of the link @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath0 know @xmath3 and the snr @xmath40 , but none of the snrs @xmath93 .",
    "then the maximal downlink transmission rate that is always decodable by @xmath1 is @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath41 .    the proof is given in appendix  [ sec : proofofgammab_nm>1 ] .",
    "an interesting side effect of the derived zero outage downlink rate bounds is how they affect the outage of the mtds links towards @xmath1 . in the case of joint decoding ( jd ) , all inequalities that involve @xmath38 must be satisfied , due to the assumed decodability of @xmath38 , such that it follows that the decodability of each individual @xmath9 does not depend on the transmission from @xmath0 . in other words , we can calculate the probability of outage for the mtds by considering only the multiple access channel of @xmath2 users , which contains only the mtds as transmitters , but not @xmath0 .",
    "we now consider the case in which @xmath1 applies single - user decoding ( sd ) in each step , treating the yet - to - be - decoded user as a noise .    :",
    "( a ) is decoded while treating the mtd transmission as noise ; ( b ) is decoded while treating the mtd transmission as noise , due to the single - user decoding ; ( c ) is decoded in the presence of noise , after the transmission from the mtd has been decoded and subtracted from the the composite signal . ]",
    "we treat first the case @xmath5 , where we show how to select the maximal downlink rate for given @xmath40 that guarantees that there is no outage .",
    "recall that there are three operating regions of the jd receiver for @xmath96 .",
    "when sd is applied , there are only two decoding options , depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : sdregime ] :    * if the link @xmath56 is weak , then @xmath43 is low and the signal from @xmath0 should be decoded by treating the signal from @xmath42 as noise . this regime is depicted in fig .",

    "[ fig : sdregime](b ) . *",
    "if the link @xmath56 is very strong , given that the mtd rate is fixed to @xmath3 , then the signal from @xmath42 is decoded , subtracted and a `` clean '' signal of @xmath0 is decoded at the maximal possible rate @xmath97 .",
    "it can be shown that the signal from @xmath42 is decodable and thus the link @xmath56 can be treated as strong when @xmath98 .",
    "this regime is depicted in fig .",

    "stated precisely , @xmath106 is the supremum of the zero - outage @xmath38 .",
    "clearly , the zero outage rate in the sd setting is much lower than the one in the jd setting .",
    "analogous to the case of jd , it is natural to ask what happens when @xmath6 and still assuming that @xmath0 is ignorant about @xmath110 , where @xmath111 .",

    "since single - user decoding is used , the signal of @xmath88 should be decoded first , treating the signals of @xmath42 and @xmath0 as a noise .",
    "let us consider only the case @xmath115 . here",

    "but , since @xmath116 it follows that both the signals from @xmath42 and @xmath88 should be treated as noise .",
    "however , in that case the rate that guarantees no outage of the downlink signal should be chosen : @xmath117 which goes arbitrarily close to zero as @xmath118 increase .",
    "thus the maximal zero - outage rate is zero .",
    "since @xmath119 does not increase with @xmath2 , it follows that the claim of the proposition is true for any @xmath6 .",
    "the last proposition reveals that joint decoding is instrumental in preserving a nonzero rate when the interfering channels @xmath110 are unknown .",
    "the derived zero - outage rates for both jd and sd , show that @xmath0 is not required to have csit from the mtd - u links",
    ". therefore , this information does not need to be exchanged prior to connection establishment , neither during the time while the communications are active . nevertheless , there are other signaling exchanges that need to be accounted for , as we discuss in the following .    first , it is the time synchronization , which can be accomplished by each device listening to the downlink control signaling and possibly some other timing adjustments .",
    "depending on the synchronization schemes in place it might correspond to extra cooperation overhead .",
    "second , the cellular receiver needs to be able to estimate the channels of the active transmitters over the mac , i.e. the channels @xmath8 of the transmitting mtds and the channel @xmath4 .",
    "this can be achieved by having dedicated preambles for each mtd that is associated with a given cellular receiver @xmath1 , as well as a dedicated preamble used by @xmath0 for downlink transmission .    since all mtds use a single codebook that is known both at the cellular user @xmath1 as well as at the base station @xmath0",
    ", there is no need to operationally exchange information on the mtd codebooks .",
    "an open question remains how to design a practical joint decoding scheme where one or multiple ( when @xmath6 ) links have a fixed rate .",
    "we reiterate the fact that the existence of single mtd codebook enables efficient design of the joint decoder .",
    "finally , it should be noted that zero - outage downlink transmission is possible because the interference power that is subject to variation comes from the devices that send at fixed rates and whose signals can be decoded if their interference is sufficiently strong .",
    "however , if there is an external source of variable interference that is not decodable , regardless of how large the interference power is , then it is not possible to have zero - outage downlink transmissions .",
    "the reason is that , to achieve zero outage , the receiver needs to know the instantaneous mac region while that is not the case if there is an external variable interference . in practice",
    ", the receiver can have an estimate upper bound on the power coming from external interference and operate with a reduced ( pessimistic ) version of the mac region .",

    "overall , our approach shows that underlaying during the downlink transmission is a viable alternative when the multiple access channels created in such a setting are fully utilized at the downlink cellular receiver .",
    "one of the most interesting issues for future research is how to design a practical joint decoder at the cellular receiver that takes advantage of the fact that the codebooks of the mtds are fixed , while the number of active mtds can vary .",
