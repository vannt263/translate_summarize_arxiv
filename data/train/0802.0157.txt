    "scalar fields have attracted a great deal of attention in cosmology , since the discovery that such a field can act as an `` effective '' cosmological constant in driving inflation @xcite . from this first break - trough , which aroused from the simplest conceivable model , i.e. that of a non self - interacting field , the research on scalar field spacetimes has been constantly growing , and quite more general scenarios have been considered , such as scalar fields coupled with perfect fluids , non - minimal couplings , and alternate theories of gravity @xcite    a scalar field spacetime can be viewed , like other matter models coupled with gravity such as perfect fluids , as a solution of the einstein field equations which depends on the choice of the equation of state for the matter . in the case of the scalar field , the role of the equation of state is played by the self - interaction potential @xmath0 , which is equal to zero in the `` standard '' inflationary solution . for several reasons , however , it is difficult to believe that this function vanishes .",
    "for instance , dimensional reduction of fundamental theories to four dimensions typically gives rise to self - interacting scalar fields with exponential potentials , coupled to four - dimensional gravity .",
    "therefore exponential potentials have been widely considered in the literature ( see @xcite and references therein ) also with the aim of uncovering possible large - scale observable effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course , however , at the present status of our knowledge the specific functional form of @xmath0 is quite unsure and , as a consequence , it would be optimal to classify the dynamical behavior of the spacetimes in dependance of all the possible choices of the potential function .",
    "relevant attempts have been made also in this more general direction .",
    "actually , the application of dynamical systems techniques has proven very useful and , due mainly to the works @xcite , we know the dynamical behavior of scalar field spacetimes for a wide class of _ non - negative _ potentials ; for such potentials therefore , as will be explained below , the contribution of the present paper relies in a simplification and completion of known results .",
    "non negativity of the potential means that the energy density of the scalar field has a positive lower bound .",
    "however , in many issues and especially when string theory comes into play , it becomes relevant to inspect spacetimes in which the potential still has a lower bound but this bound is negative . from the physical point of view , it should be noted that , although care must be given to the fact that local positivity of energy density might be violated in these spacetimes , under certain somewhat general conditions potentials of this kind generate solutions with positive total energy @xcite .",
    "in particular , of course , a constant negative potential generates an `` equilibrium '' state which is just the anti de sitter solution ( ads ) ; therefore , a potential with a negative minimum generates a class of spacetimes which have an ads `` equilibrium '' ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we thus study the dynamical behavior of frw scalar field cosmological models , imposing only very general conditions on the scalar field potential ; our hypotheses essentially reduce to ask the potential to be bounded from below and divergent when the field diverges . within this quite general framework , we give a unified treatment of all the relevant known cases - such as asymptotically polynomial and exponential behaviors - as well as its completion to a much wider set of possible , physically sensible potentials , also in presence of negative ( i.e. ads ) minima .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our treatment can be applied to the `` reverse '' problem as well , i.e. to homogeneous scalar field collapse .",
    "this issue is treated in companion papers @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we formulate the field equations as a first order , regular dynamical system for the scalar field , its time derivative , and the scale factor .",
    "then , we study in full generality the behavior of the trajectories of this system in dependance of the properties of the potential function . finally , the issue of recollapse and that of stability of ads spacetimes are addressed .",
    "in particular , we show that that anti desitter solutions are the only solutions such that @xmath1 goes to a critical point of @xmath2 with negative critical value .",
    "einstein s field equations for the robertson  walker model @xmath3,\\ ] ] coupled with the stress  energy tensor @xmath4 are given by @xmath5 @xmath6 in the unknown functions @xmath7 .",
    "these equations imply @xmath8 we transform the above second order system  into a first order system introducing the additional variables @xmath9",
    ". we must exclude solutions such that @xmath10 constant on some interval but @xmath11 .",
    "] , so that we are sure that holds due to the vanishing of the term in brackets .",
    "therefore @xmath12 solves the regular system @xmath13 to see that the converse also holds true , we define the function @xmath14 and argue as follows . given a solution @xmath15 of",
    " , then @xmath16 , the derivative of @xmath17 along the solution , satisfies the differential equation @xmath18 that yields @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , we set @xmath20 where @xmath21 if @xmath22 , and @xmath23 if @xmath24",
    ". then the identity @xmath25 holds , where @xmath26 , and so @xmath27 and @xmath28 solve  , from which follows .",
    "we stress some features of the above approach : first , the system obtained is regular , with equilibrium points given by @xmath29 such that @xmath30 ( notice that @xmath31 ) , that physically correspond to desitter universe .",
    "given a solution @xmath15 , then @xmath32 is the time reversed solution .",
    "moreover , the system represents solutions of _ all _ robertson  walker cosmologies : indeed , from , the set @xmath33 is invariant by the flow , and by local uniqueness this ensures that the sign of @xmath34 is invariant along the flow ; from we deduce that solutions with @xmath34 positive , null , or negative , represent scalar field cosmologies with @xmath35 respectively . from the sign of @xmath36",
    "one can tell whether , at the instant @xmath37 , the solution is collapsing ( @xmath38 ) or expanding ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "in this section we consider initially expanding spacetimes , i.e. solutions such that @xmath40 .",
    "we suppose that the potential @xmath2 is a @xmath41 function , such that @xmath42 .",
    "we will suppose that critical points of @xmath0 are isolated , and they are either minimum points or nondegenerate maximum points .",
    "we also impose the weak energy condition to be satisfied at initial time , i.e. @xmath43 .",
    "of course , this is not sufficient for the w.e.c . to be satisfied along the evolution , since @xmath2 can attain also negative values .",
    "it is useful to introduce the energy function @xmath44 in such a way that ",
    "imply @xmath45 if we let the solution evolve , either there exists @xmath46 such that @xmath47 , or @xmath48 for all @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the maximal interval of definition of the solution . in the latter case ,",
    "from we deduce that @xmath51 and moreover , recalling , @xmath52 .",
    "notice also that @xmath53 is bounded from below since @xmath2 is , and this implies that both @xmath27 and @xmath54 are bounded .",
    "supposing @xmath36 always positive during the evolution , let us consider separately the cases @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "in the first case @xmath57 decreases , since and imply @xmath58 and so @xmath57 also is bounded . on the other side , @xmath56 implies @xmath59 and so @xmath57 is bounded again . in any case",
    "the solution lives in a compact set , and this means that @xmath60 , and it is easily proven that it converges to an equilibrium point @xmath29 of the system .    translated into the original formulation , we deduce that if an originally expanding solution does not recollapse , then it is regular for all times , the scalar @xmath1 converges to a critical point @xmath61 of the potential @xmath0 , with nonnegative critical value , and @xmath62 .",
    "an example is sketched in figure [ fig : dyna2 ] , when the phase portrait for the system  is sketched , for a potential that has two local minima , one with positive critical value , the other one with negative critical value .",
    "in the first case , every solution starting nearby the critical point @xmath63 approaches it , regardless of the curvature ( @xmath64 , or 1 ) . in the second case , the negative minimum determines an intersection between the two branches of the set @xmath65 , that acts as a `` tunnel '' allowing solution such that @xmath55 and starting with @xmath39 to recollapse .",
    "the recollapse problem is an interesting feature of these cosmological models that deserves to be further investigated ( see section [ sec : rec ] ) . at the moment",
    ", we observe that  but a simple inspection of also  implies that solutions with @xmath66 may recollapse only if they violate the w.e.c . , and , by the aforesaid , that occurs only if @xmath0 can attain negative values .",
    "we will turn back on this situation later when we will examine stability of anti de sitter model .",
    "now we examine stability of the equilibria @xmath29 as expanding solutions , where @xmath61 is a critical point of the functional and @xmath67 .",
    "recall that , by the assumptions made on @xmath2 , @xmath61 is either a minimum , or a non degenerate maximum .",
    "let us now briefly review the second situation : here , one can simply linearize the system  to find that eigenvalues are always real , and one of them is always positive , and one always negative , which results in the existence of a 1- or 2-dimensional unstable manifold at the equilibrium point , and then , up to a zero  measure set of initial data , the scalar field do not approach the maximum .",
    "now , consider the case when @xmath61 is local minimum for @xmath0 , with non negative critical value . if @xmath61 is a non degenerate critical value , asymptotic stability of the equilibrium",
    "is found simply using the linearized flow of  , and therefore solutions with initial data near the equilibrium point approach it , regardless the case @xmath68 under consideration . here , we want to extend to the case @xmath61 is possibly degenerate .",
    "let us begin considering the situation @xmath69 , in the open topologies @xmath55 .",
    "let us consider first the case @xmath70 is _ strictly _ positive .",
    "we call @xmath71 a regular value such that @xmath61 is the only critical point in the connected component of @xmath72-\\infty,\\bar v])$ ] containing @xmath61 , and let us consider a solution @xmath15 with initial data such that @xmath73 , and let @xmath74 .",
    "we define @xmath75 to be the connected component of the set @xmath76,\\,\\epsilon(\\phi , v)\\in[2v(\\phi_*),2\\bar v]\\}$ ] containing the equilibrium point @xmath77 .",
    "it is easy to see , using and , that @xmath75 is compact , and positively invariant by the flow .",
    "so , let us consider a solution with initial data in @xmath75 . applying lasalle s invariance theorem @xcite to the functions @xmath34 and @xmath78",
    ", we see that the solution must be such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 . but",
    "@xmath57 is strictly bounded away from zero in @xmath75 , then both @xmath34 and @xmath81 must go to zero , which means that the solution approaches the equilibrium point . since the critical value is strictly positive , then says that the scale factor @xmath28 diverges at infinity like @xmath82 .    if @xmath83 , the above argument can be easily adapted . in this case",
    "the set @xmath76,\\,\\epsilon(\\phi , v)\\in[2v(\\phi_*),2\\bar v]\\}$ ] is connected , and we choose @xmath75 to be its subset characterized by the property @xmath84 .",
    "the only point in @xmath75 with @xmath85 is exactly the equilibrium point , and so if @xmath86 ( recall @xmath57 is monotone ) the solution is forced to approach the equilibrium .",
    "if by contradiction @xmath36 had a strictly positive limit , we can argue as before to find @xmath87 and @xmath88 and so @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , when the minimum is non degenerate , then the couple @xmath90 has an oscillatory behavior .",
    "this fact was already pointed out by rendall for the flat case @xcite , but it actually takes place also when @xmath66 . indeed , taking @xmath91 for sake of simplicity , and using the variable change @xmath92 , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , with @xmath95 , then the equation for @xmath96 reads @xmath97 and since both @xmath98 and @xmath57 go to zero , we deduce that @xmath99 , and this implies the oscillatory behavior of @xmath1 ( and @xmath81 ) .",
    "an example of this is sketched in figure [ fig : dyna3 ]    then , it remains proven that every solution of flat or negatively curved robertson ",
    "walker cosmology with initial data near the local minimum of the potential expands forever approaching this minimum , and the velocity of the scalar field vanishes at infinity .",
    "if @xmath56 , we must adapt the above argument , since now we do not have a priori information on monotony of @xmath57 ( see ) .",
    "as before , we start from the case @xmath100 , and take @xmath101 and initial data such that @xmath102 , whereas now @xmath103 will be a negative value to determine in such a way that it acts as a lower bound for @xmath34 .",
    "supposing that initial data are taken near the equilibrium , then @xmath57 starts positive ; since @xmath104 , and imply that @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "last relation , in particular , shows that @xmath107 and this means that @xmath27 is forced to stay in the potential well @xmath108 .",
    "then @xmath109 that is @xmath110 then , chosen @xmath103 sufficiently small such that @xmath111 , we have that @xmath112",
    ". therefore , we can apply again lasalle s invariance theorem as in the case @xmath55 and exploit the fact that @xmath57 is bounded away from zero .",
    "all in all , a result of stability of local minima of @xmath2 with positive critical value holds also in the positively curved robertson  walker cosmologies .",
    "this result , however , can not be extended as before to the case @xmath83 , because the equilibrium is such that @xmath113 , and so nearby solutions may recollapse ( i.e. @xmath57 can change sign ) .",
    "in this section we give some answer to the recollapsing solutions problem sketched before , specifically in the open topology cosmologies , and address the question of stability of anti de sitter solutions with respect to perturbations in the robertson ",
    "walker cosmologies .",
    "let us consider a solution of  with @xmath114 . since the sign of @xmath34 is invariant along the flow , we know that @xmath115 implies , using , that @xmath36 is monotone decreasing .",
    "if the potential @xmath2 is nonnegative , we already know from previous section that no recollapse will take place , and the solution will expand for all times .",
    "so , let @xmath116 be such that @xmath72-\\infty,\\bar v])$ ] has a connected component containing only a critical point @xmath117 which is a local minimum with negative critical value . taking initial data such that @xmath73 , then @xmath78 and @xmath34 will decrease until @xmath57 remains positive , and the solution is forced to remain in the ( compact ) set such that @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119 .",
    "but there are no equilibrium points to approach in this set , which means that there must be a time @xmath120 when @xmath47 , and the solution recollapse ( notice that this happens violating w.e.c . ) .    among these solutions",
    ", we can consider anti desitter models , which occur when @xmath121 , and @xmath122 .",
    "let us call @xmath123 ; then takes the form @xmath124 that integrates to give @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the constant of integration .",
    "then @xmath36 diverges to @xmath127 in a finite time @xmath128 , and so by @xmath129 , and by , @xmath28 goes to zero , but this is actually a `` false '' singularity , that does not correspond to a divergence of stress energy tensor which instead remains finite , since @xmath81 and @xmath1 are constant .    in order to investigate stability of these solutions , we choose initial data @xmath130 near @xmath131 , and suppose that @xmath15 is a solution of  , defined in an interval @xmath50 , such that @xmath132 , @xmath133",
    ". then @xmath36 diverges to @xmath127 as @xmath134 .",
    "indeed , by , and recalling @xmath135 , @xmath36 is eventually decreasing , but if @xmath36 admits a finite value it would be bounded , so that @xmath60 and @xmath136 would tend to a negative value , which can not happen .",
    "this fact implies , again , that @xmath28 goes to zero , that means , using , that @xmath137 now let us consider equation , and call @xmath138 the ( bounded ) function @xmath139",
    ". then it must be @xmath140 which can be integrated to give a diverging solution , once we prove that @xmath141 .",
    "indeed , one can consider situations where @xmath142 , but if @xmath122 for all time , would give @xmath143 for all time , that means @xmath144 , obtaining anti desitter model once again . then @xmath145 can be taken nonzero without loss of generality , and this results in a diverging solution @xmath54 , which is in contradiction with the assumption @xmath146 bounded .",
    "we conclude that anti desitter solutions are the only solutions of  such that @xmath1 goes to a critical point of @xmath2 with negative critical value .",
    "we analysed here the dynamics of homogeneous robertson  walker cosmological models with a self - interacting scalar field source within a quite general class of ( physically valid ) potentials @xmath2 , essentially requiring only the function @xmath0 to be bounded from below and divergent when the field diverges .",
    "the analysis has been carried out by casting the problem as a regular dynamical system whose solutions describe the possible robertson walker cosmologies together with the scalar field evolution .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the expanding ( cosmological ) solutions depends crucially on the sign and the extrema of the function @xmath0 .",
    "first of all , if @xmath0 is positive , the scalar field always approaches the minimum and the solutions do never re - collapse .",
    "this result extends and completes already existing results , for instance for exponential potentials , and holds also for the special case of vanishing @xmath0 at the minimum if the topology is not closed .",
    "the situation complicates drastically for potentials with a negative lower bound .",
    "indeed , solutions which are close to the negative minimum are repulsed ; from the cosmological point of view , the corresponding universes re - collapse .",
    "the unique exception is the solutions which `` sits '' on the negative minimum , which of course is the anti de sitter space - time . in this sense , ads turns out to be unstable within homogeneous scalar fields cosmologies .",
    "the phase space in case of several extrema can be sketched using as an example a potential with a positive maximum and one negative and one positive minimum .",
    "clearly , from the results above , the phase space contains ever expanding solutions approaching the positive minimum , and recollapsing solutions .",
    "the two sets are separated by solutions for which the scalar field tends to the maximum of the potential .",
    "it can be easily shown however that the initial data leading to such a situation form a two - dimensional surface , and therefore these data , besides being of course unstable , are not generic .",
