    "the purpose of this contribution is to summarize the constraints on supersymmetric models from various experimental results . due to the large wealth of experimental searches for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) and phenomenological studies on supersymmetry ( susy ) it is impossible to cover all of them in this short review .",
    "thus the author apologizes that many valuable studies are not mentioned or cited in this report .    to set the scene ,",
    "a short review of the most widely studied susy models is given in the next section .",
    "the following sections discuss constraints on the parameter space of these models from high energy colliders , electroweak precision data , flavor and higgs physics , and cosmology , respectively .",
    "finally , some qualitative comments on more general susy models are presented before the summary .",
    "the most extensively studied susy model is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , with the particle content listed in table  [ mssm ] . in addition",
    "the mssm imposes r - parity , assigning @xmath0 for the higgs boson , gauge bosons , leptons , and quarks , and @xmath1 for their supersymmetric partners ( neutralinos , charginos , gluino , sleptons , and squarks ) . as a result",
    "the superpotential has the form @xmath2 for a general introduction to the mssm and notational definitions , see _",
    "g . _ ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in the major part of this work , an even more minimal version of the mssm is assumed where the ckm matrix is the only source of cp violation and flavor violation . in other words ,",
    "the susy breaking parameters are assumed to be real and flavor blind .",
    ".particle content of the mssm [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tevlim ]    the mssm parameter space is also constrained indirectly by the lower limit on the mass of a sm - like higgs boson from lep searches , @xmath4 @xcite . in the mssm",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass can be calculated as a function of other parameters . the leading tree - level and one - loop contributions",
    "are given by @xmath5 + ... , \\qquad x_t = a_t - \\frac{\\mu}{\\tan\\beta } , \\label{hfor}\\ ] ] where the dots stand for higher - order corrections . to be compatible with the lep limit , the terms in eq .",
    "( [ hfor ] ) need to be large so that at least one of the following conditions must be met :    * @xmath6 to maximize the tree - level term @xmath7 , * large average stop mass , @xmath8 , * large stop mixing to enhance the @xmath9 term .    in extended models with extra singlets ( nmssm , nmssm ) or gauge groups ( umssm ) the constraints on the susy parameter space from the @xmath10 limit are much less severe due to new positive tree - level contributions to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "loop corrections from susy particles affect the predictions for electroweak precision observables . much effort has been invested in calculating the radiative corrections from susy loops .",
    "the current state of the art in the mssm encompasses complete one - loop corrections @xcite and leading two - loop corrections of order @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite . for the nmssm and other extensions",
    "only partial one - loop results are known .",
    "the most important quantities that have been measured with high precision and that receive sizable corrections from new physics are :    * the @xmath13-boson mass @xmath14 , which is determined from the muon decay width by including the relevant radiative corrections for the process @xmath15 . * the effective weak mixing angle of the @xmath16 boson , defined through the effective vector and axial vector couplings of the @xmath16 boson on the @xmath16 resonance , @xmath17 .",
    "the effective mixing angle can be defined for all fermion flavors although the numerical differences are small except for the @xmath18 vertex . * the total @xmath16-boson width , @xmath19 , and the total @xmath16 peak cross section @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "both of these quantities are closely related to the coupling combination @xmath21 . * the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath22 .    by performing a fit of the mssm predictions for these quantities to the experimentally determined values @xcite one finds in general good agreement for light sleptons and gauginos .",
    "the reason for this is two - fold : _",
    "( i ) _ in the sm the best fit to the electroweak precision observables corresponds to a higgs mass of @xmath23 , which creates a tension with the lower limit from direct searches , @xmath24 . the new contributions from slepton - gaugino loops can push the best - fit higgs mass to values @xmath25 , thus improving the overall goodness - of - fit . _ ( ii ) _ susy loop contributions from sleptons and gauginos can account for the 3.3@xmath26 discrepancy between the sm prediction and the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath27 @xcite .    the results of a @xmath28 fit for the msugra / cmssm , gmsb , and amsb scenarios are shown in fig .",
    "[ ewsusy ] .",
    "the plots show the best fit @xmath28 as a function of the mass of the neutralino @xmath29 , which has a dominant wino or higgsino component in these scenarios . as evident from the figure , in all three scenarios a light neutralino with @xmath30 is preferred , while neutralino masses above 1  tev are strongly disfavored .",
    "rare decays of heavy flavor mesons are very sensitive to new physics effects . for susy models these effects",
    "are enhanced for large values of @xmath31 since the yukawa couplings of the down - type fermions become large , @xmath32 .",
    "schematically , the dependence of rare @xmath33 decays on @xmath31 in the mssm reads @xmath34 & \\sim \\frac{\\tan^6\\beta}{m_a^4 } , \\\\ { \\rm br}[b_u \\to \\tau\\nu ] & \\sim \\biggl [ 1-\\frac{m_b^2}{m_a^2 } \\tan^2\\beta \\biggr ] ^2 , \\\\ { \\rm br}[b \\to s\\gamma ] & \\sim 1 + a\\tan\\beta+b\\tan\\beta / m_a^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath33 are coefficient that depend on other susy parameters in a non - trivial way .    in the region of large @xmath31 ,",
    "the production cross section for the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath36 at hadron colliders is also increased , @xmath37 \\sim \\tan^2\\beta,\\ ] ] establishing an intricate relationship between heavy - flavor and higgs observables with respect to the susy parameter space @xcite .",
    "the negative searches of the @xmath36 boson at the tevatron @xcite exclude the parameter region of large @xmath31 and small @xmath38 , with very little dependence on other susy parameters .",
    "similarly , the current experimental upper limit on br@xmath39 $ ] is most important for large @xmath31 and small @xmath38 , although with some dependence on other variables , @xmath40 . depending on the value of these quantities",
    "the constraint from br@xmath39 $ ] on the susy parameter space can be stronger or weaker than the bound from @xmath36 searches .",
    "the measurement of br@xmath41 $ ] , in good agreement with the sm , allows either the region of small @xmath42 or of large @xmath42 ( although the latter is severely limited by the previous two observables ) , while intermediate values of @xmath43 are disfavored .",
    "finally , br@xmath44 $ ] varies relatively mildly as a function of @xmath38 , but it places both an lower and upper bound on @xmath31 .",
    "however , the prediction of br@xmath44 $ ] is affected by many susy parameters so that quantitative conclusions depend quite strongly on the scenario .    the flavor physics and higgs constraints mentioned above",
    "are summarized in fig .",
    "[ bh ] for the mssm .",
    "note that while the @xmath33-physics observables seem to impose very severe limits on @xmath38 and @xmath31 these bounds depend substantially on other susy parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , which for the purpose of this analysis is assumed to be a common mass for all squarks .",
    "the most robust , scenario - independent constraint comes from @xmath36 searches which can be expressed roughly as @xmath49 .",
    "the derivation of bounds on the susy parameter space from cosmology depends on many details of the susy model as well as the history of the universe and might be impacted by theoretical uncertainties that have not been quantified so far .",
    "nevertheless it is illustrative to study some of the constraints since even at a qualitative level they affect the parameter structure of the model .",
    "for conserved r - parity , the lsp is a stable particle and could provide a good cold dark matter candidate as long as it is neutral and weakly interacting . within the standard cosmological model it is possible to calculate the expected relic dark matter density for a given susy model , although often the results depend on many model parameters .",
    "however typically only certain corners of the parameter space give good agreement with the measured value from the cosmic microwave background , @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "there are three main possibilities for lsps as viable dark matter candidates in the mssm :    * _ lightest neutralino @xmath51 : _ if the lightest neutralino has a dominant bino component , annihilation into gauge bosons is strongly suppressed .",
    "thus , to be compatible with the observed dark matter density , one of the following enhancement mechanisms for the annihilation cross section needs to be present : * * light sleptons , @xmath52 , together with @xmath53 lead to a sufficiently large t - channel contribution .",
    "this parameter region is often called the _ `` bulk '' region_. * * co - annihilation : if the mass difference to the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nslp ) @xmath54 is small , @xmath55 , both particles annihilate in parallel in the early universe .",
    "a large @xmath56 co - annihilation cross section can then compensate for a small @xmath57 annihilation rate . *",
    "* resonant annihilation : if the mass of the neutralino is close to half of the mass of a possible bosonic s - channel resonance , @xmath58 , neutralino pair annihilation can proceed efficiently through this resonance .",
    "+ alternatively , the neutralino @xmath51 could be an admixture with sizable wino and/or higgsino components . in this case",
    ", the @xmath57 annihilation rate into gauge boson naturally has the right order of magnitude for @xmath59 . *",
    "_ sneutrino @xmath60 : _ it has been known for many years that the l - sneutrino @xmath61 can not be the dominant source of dark matter since it would lead to a collision rate with ordinary matter that is much larger than the current bounds from direct detection experiments . however , as indicated by the observation of neutrino oscillations , it is likely that also l- and r - sneutrinos mix with each other .",
    "a sneutrino with a dominant r - sneutrino ( @xmath62 ) component would constitute a good dark matter candidate in agreement with all constraints for 10 gev @xmath63 1 tev @xcite . * _ gravitino @xmath64 : _ gravitino dark matter can be produced in two ways , see _",
    "_ @xcite : * * gravitinos can be produced non - thermally from decays of the nlsp @xmath54 .",
    "late decays of the nlsp can lead to entropy overproduction and thus hot dark matter in disagreement with large scale structure formation .",
    "since @xmath65 \\propto     \\frac{m_{\\tilde{x}}^5}{m_{\\tilde{g}}^2 }      \\biggl(1-\\frac{m_{\\tilde{g}}^2}{m_{\\tilde{x}}^2}\\biggr)^4\\ ] ] this places a lower bound @xmath66 .",
    "if this bound is satisfied the correct relic abundance can be obtained for gravitino masses in the range @xmath67 @xcite . * * alternatively , gravitinos can be produced thermally directly from the hot plasma in the early universe .",
    "when produced from thermal equilibrium the gravitino abundance is much too large ( `` gravitino problem '' ) .",
    "therefore the reheating temperature @xmath68 of the universe is required to be much smaller than the gravitino equilibrium temperature . in this case",
    "non - equilibrium thermal production is viable for @xmath69 , depending on the exact value of @xmath68 .      if the lsp is a gravitino the energy released from nlsp decays can be problematic for successful big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "hadronic and electromagnetic showers emitted by the nlsp decays can dissociate light element nuclei and thus shift the predicted ratios of element abundances .",
    "for the nlsp to disrupt bbn , the nlsp lifetime has to be @xmath70  s. therefore this constraint excludes small nlsp masses and large gravitino masses .    for @xmath71 as nlsp",
    ", the detailed constraints are shown in fig .",
    "[ bbn ] @xcite .",
    "depending on assumptions in the evaluation of the primordial nuclei abundances the bbn constraints place an upper bound @xmath72500 gev .      new physics beyond the sm",
    "is needed to explain the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe .",
    "the two most well - known mechanisms are leptogenesis and electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "_ leptogenesis _ generates the particle - antiparticle asymmetry through the decay of long - lived heavy neutrinos @xmath73 or sneutrinos @xmath62 .",
    "this mechanisms imposes strong constraints on the masses , mixings and cp phases of the right - chiral ( s)neutrino sector , but if @xmath74 it is in general not testable by collider experiments . in _ electroweak baryogenesis _ , on the other hand , the matter asymmetry is created by the electroweak phase transition if it is strongly first order and involves cp - violating currents .    in the mssm",
    "a strong first order phase transition is only realizable if one of the stops is light , @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass bound , @xmath76 then requires the other stop to be much heavier , @xmath77 . in singlet extensions ( nmssm / nmssm ) the strength of the electroweak phase transition",
    "is increased by the new higgs - singlet couplings and no special values for the stop masses are needed @xcite .",
    "cp - violating currents can originate from the chargino / neutralino sector both in the mssm and nmssm / nmssm .",
    "however , due to strong limits on electric dipole moments of the electron and neutrino , such cp phases are only allowed for very large masses of the first generation sfermions , @xmath78 . in the nmssm / nmssm",
    "the cp phase responsible for baryogenesis can also be implemented in the higgs sector , leading to weaker constraints from electric dipole moments @xcite .",
    "neutralinos @xmath51 that are almost exclusively bino and have negligible wino and higgsino components are not constrained by collider data .",
    "the only relevant bounds come from astrophysics and cosmology @xcite :    * for conserved r - parity a lower bound @xmath79 has to be imposed to avoid dark matter overproduction .",
    "* independent of r - parity conservation , very light neutralinos can contribute to supernova cooling for moderately light selectrons , @xmath80 .",
    "the observations from sn  1987a thus lead to a lower limit @xmath81 in this case .",
    "however , for @xmath82 no constraint on the neutralino mass can be derived from supernova cooling .",
    "* very light neutralinos have a large free - streaming length and thus can jeopardize structure formation .",
    "this consideration excludes values of @xmath83 between 1  ev and 1  kev .    in summary , limits on light bino - like",
    "@xmath51 are very weak and @xmath83 is largely unconstrained .",
    "in this section the assumptions of r - parity conservation , minimal flavor violation and cp conservation will be relaxed one at the time . as a result ,",
    "many bounds on the mssm parameter space become weaker or disappear altogether .",
    "the sfermion soft breaking parameters can introduce new sources of flavor violation , in particular leading to potentially large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "fcncs are strongly constrained by @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 mixing , rare @xmath33 decays , and limits on lepton flavor violating processes such as @xmath87 , @xmath88 conversion , _ etc .",
    "_ however , if new flavor violating terms are introduced in the 2nd and 3rd generation only , flavor mixing sfermion mass terms as large as @xmath89 are still allowed by present data @xcite .",
    "complex cp phases in the gaugino sector and in the parameters of the 1st generation sfermions are strongly constrained by electric dipole moments ( see previous section ) .",
    "sizable cp violation is however allowed in the higgs sector and the sector of the 3rd generation sfermions .      without r - parity conservation",
    "the mssm superpotential is extended by the following couplings : @xmath90 the product of baryon - number violating and lepton - number violating couplings is strongly constrained by proton decay , _ i.@xmath3e .",
    "_ latexmath:[$|\\lambda''_{ijk}\\lambda_{ijk}| ,    explained by discrete symmetries while still allowing some non - zero r - parity violating couplings . in the absence of @xmath33-violating terms the @xmath92-violating interactions are mainly constrained by data on neutrino masses , leading to @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "if r - parity is violated the lsp is not stable and the signatures for susy particles production at colliders are dramatically altered . as a result ,",
    "experimental bounds for several susy particles becomes much weaker .",
    "in particular one finds @xmath94 gev @xcite , @xmath95 gev , @xmath96 gev @xcite , and @xmath97 gev @xcite .",
    "due to the complexity of the susy parameters space ( even in the mssm with r - parity conservation , minimal flavor violation and cp conservation ) and the large number of experimental results it is difficult to summarize all constraints in a simple picture . in table",
    "[ summ ] a rough overview of the main limits from direct sparticle and higgs searches , as well as electroweak precision data and flavor physics is attempted .",

    "the nmssm limits also apply for the nmssm and umssm . a ``",
