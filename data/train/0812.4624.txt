    "inflation is nowadays a well established paradigm , consistent with all the observations , that solves most of the puzzles of the hot big bang model in a very simple and elegant way .",
    "it is able to explain not only the homogeneity and isotropy of the present universe on large scales , but also the generation of almost scale invariant primordial perturbations that give rise to the structure formation @xcite .",
    "however , the naturalness of inflation is directly related to the origin of the inflaton .",
    "most of the inflationary models proposed so far require the introduction of new degrees of freedom to drive inflation .",
    "the nature of the inflaton is completely unknown , and its role could be played by any candidate able to imitate a scalar condensate ( tipically in the slow - roll regime ) , such as a fundamental scalar field , a fermionic or vector condensate , or even higher order terms of the curvature invariants .",
    "the number of particle physics motivated candidates is as big as the number of extensions of the standard model ( grand unified theories , supersymmetry , extra dimensions , etc . ) , where it is not very difficult to find a field that could play the role of the inflaton  @xcite .",
    "in addition , given a model we must find a graceful exit to inflation and a mechanism to bring the universe from a cold and empty post - inflationary state to the highly entropic and thermal friedmann universe  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the theory of reheating is also far from being complete , since not only the details , but even the overall picture , depend crucially on the different microphysical models .",
    "it seems difficult to study the details of reheating in each concrete model without the experimental knowledge of the strength of the interactions among the inflaton and the matter fields . because of this , most of the work until now has focussed on models encoding the different mechanisms that could play a role in the process , with the strength of the couplings set essentially by hand .",
    "the relative importance of each one of these mechanisms can only be clarified in light of an underlying particle physics model , able to provide us with the couplings among the inflaton and matter fields . from this point of view",
    "it is very difficult to single out a given model of inflation , and even more difficult to understand the details of the reheating process via the experimental access to the couplings .",
    "we may be very far away from understanding the microphysical mechanisms responsible for inflation , but maybe the natural candidate for being the inflaton was already there long ago .",
    "if we do not want to introduce new dynamical degrees of freedom in the theory , apart from those present in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , and at the same time we require lorentz and gauge invariance , we are left with just one possibility : the higgs field .",
    "early models of inflation in terms of a higgs - like scalar field @xmath2 with a quartic self - interaction potential @xmath3 need an extremely small coupling constant @xmath4 @xcite , and are also nowadays excluded at around @xmath5 by the present observational data @xcite .",
    "however , the sm - based inflation may be rescued from these difficulties replacing the usual einstein - hilbert action by a non - minimal coupling of the higgs field to the ricci scalar @xcite , in a scalar - tensor theory fashion @xmath6 the induced gravity ( @xmath7 ) action is indeed the most natural generalization of the standard model in a curved spacetime , given the relevance of the non - minimal coupling to gravity for renormalizing the theory @xcite .",
    "it belongs to a group of theories known as scalar - tensor theories , originally introduced by brans and dicke @xcite to explain the origin of the masses . in those theories",
    "not only the active masses but also the gravitational constant @xmath8 , are determined by the distribution of matter and energy throughout the universe , in a clear connection with the mach principle .",
    "the interaction that gives rise to the masses should be the gravitational one , since gravity couples to all particles , _",
    "i.e. _ to their masses or energies .",
    "the gravitational constant @xmath8 in these theories is replaced by a scalar function that permeates the whole space - time and interacts with all the ordinary matter content , determining how the later moves through space and time .",
    "any measurements of an object s mass depends therefore on the local value of this new field .",
    "the successful higgs mechanism lies precisely in the same direction of the original mach s idea of producing mass by a gravitational - like interaction .",
    "the role of the higgs field in the standard model is basically to provide the inertial mass of all matter fields through the local spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "the higgs boson couples to all the particles in the standard model in a very specific way , with a strengh proportional to their masses @xcite , and mediates a scalar gravitational interaction of yukawa type  @xcite , between those particles which become massive as a consequence of the local spontaneous symmetry breaking . according to the equivalence principle",
    ", it seems natural to identify the gravitational and particle physics approaches to the origin of the masses . from this point of view",
    ", the induced gravity action ( [ ig ] ) would be an indication of a connection between the higgs , gravity and inertia .",
    "indeed , the action ( [ ig ] ) is , at least at the classical level , just a different representation of the starobinsky s model of inflation @xcite , where inflation is entirely a property of the gravitational sector .",
    "both representations of the same theory are simply related by a legendre transformation .",
    "this fact , together with the possibility of having an inflationary expansion of the universe , makes the model extremely appealing .",
    "unfortunately , the induced gravity model can not be accepted as a completely satisfactory inflationary scenario , since the gauge bosons acquire a constant mass in the einstein frame and totally decouple from the higgs - inflaton field @xcite , which translates into an inefficient reheating of the universe .",
    "notice however that the action ( [ ig ] ) is not the most general one that can be written in a nontrivial background . as was shown in @xcite the simultaneous existence of a reduced _ bare _ planck mass @xmath9 and a non - minimal coupling of a symmetry breaking field to the scalar curvature @xmath10 avoid the decoupling of the gauge bosons and can give rise to an inflationary expansion of the universe together with a potentially successful reheating .",
    "in this paper we initiate the study of the reheating process in the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the symmetry breaking field is the standard model higgs , strongly non - minimally coupled to gravity and playing the role of the inflaton .",
    "the novelty and great advantage of this model is its connection with a well - known microphysical mechanism , hopefully accessible in the near future accelerator experiments .",
    "the measurement of the higgs mass will complete the list of the couplings of the standard model and , therefore , one should be able to study all the details of the reheating mechanism .",
    "this makes the model under consideration extremely interesting and , potentially , predictive .",
    "reheating in the context of scalar - tensor theories has been studied , in the hartree approximation by ref .",
    "@xcite , and perturbatively by ref .",
    "@xcite , but without the higgs boson playing the role of the inflaton , and therefore without an explicit coupling of the fundamental scalar field to matter .    studying the details of reheating in this higgs - inflaton scenario ,",
    "we have put special attention to the relative impact of the different mechanisms that can take place .",
    "we have found that the universe does not reheat immediately through perturbative decays , but rather initiate a complex procces in which perturbative and non - perturbative effects are mixed .",
    "the higgs condensate starts oscillating around the minimum of its potential , producing @xmath1 and @xmath0 gauge bosons due to violation of the so called adiabaticity condition . during each semi",
    "- oscillation , the non - perturbatively created gauge bosons decay ( perturbatively ) into fermions .",
    "this decay prevents the development of the usual parametric resonance , since bosons do not accumulate significantly at the beginning .",
    "the energy transferred to the decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe within a few oscillations , and therefore the resonance effects will eventually dominate over the perturbative decays . around the same time , the backreaction from the gauge bosons into the higgs condensate will also start to be significant .",
    "soon afterwards , the universe is filled with the remnant condensate of the higgs and a non - thermal distribution of fermions and bosons ( those of the sm ) , which redshift as radiation and matter , respectively .",
    "we end the paper computing the distribution of the energy budget among all the species present at the time of backreaction . from there on until thermalization , the evolution of the system is highly non - linear and non - perturbative , and will require a careful study via numerical simulations , to be described in a future publication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ higgssector ]",
    "we present the model with the higgs field non - minimally coupled to the scalar curvature , transform it into a new frame where the action takes the usual einstein - hilbert form , and derive an approximate inflationary potential . in section  [ mattersector ]",
    "we study the effect of the conformal transformation in the matter sector , including the interaction among the higgs , vector bosons and fermions .",
    "section  [ reheating ] is devoted to the analysis of the different reheating mechanisms , both perturbative and non - perturbative , that can take place , leaving for section  [ stimulateddecays ] the analysis of the combined effect of parametric resonance and perturbative decays .",
    "we then study the backreaction of the produced particles on the higgs oscillations and the end of preheating in section  [ backreaction ] .",
    "finally the conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the glashow - weinberg - salam @xcite action is divided into four parts : a fermion sector @xmath11 which includes the kinetic terms for the fermions and their interaction with the gauge bosons , a gauge sector @xmath12 , including the kinetic terms for the intermediate bosons as well as the gauge fixing and faddeev - popov terms , a spontaneous symmetry breaking sector @xmath13 , with a higgs potential and the kinetic term for the higgs field including its interaction with the gauge fields , and finally , a yukawa sector @xmath14 , with the interaction among the higgs and the fermions of the standard model , @xmath15 the simplest versions of this lagrangian in curved spacetime follow the principles of general covariance and locality for both matter and gravitational sectors . to preserve the fundamental features of the original theory in flat space - time",

    "the number of possible terms in the action is unbounded even in this case and some additional restrictions are needed .",
    "a natural requirement could be renormalizability and simplicity .",

    "on the other hand , the relativistic nature of the fermions and the decrease of their production rate with the expansion , as @xmath340 , would tend to decrease such a ratio .",

    "initially , the perturbative decay will prevent the resonance to be effective .",
    "however , after a certain number of oscillations ( a number that we will estimate next ) , the resonant effect will overtake the perturbative decays and parametric resonance will be developed as usual , as if the produced bosons would not decay perturbatively during each semi - oscillation .    in order to estimate the time in which the perturbative decays stop blocking the parametric resonance effect , we can evaluate numerically when the expression @xmath447 becomes subdominant versus @xmath448 .",
    "in particular , we can evaluate the ratios , for either @xmath0 or @xmath1 @xmath449 for the fastest growing mode @xmath450  ( [ pico ] ) , and find the number of semi - oscillations @xmath451 for which the previous ratio becomes greater than one , @xmath452 .",

    "therefore , the _ combined preheating _ of the @xmath0 bosons is much faster driven into the parametric - like behaviour , while the evolution of the @xmath1 bosons is much more affected by the perturbative decays , delaying ( or even completely preventing ) the development of parametric resonance . obviously , after a dozen of oscillations , the transfer of energy from the inflaton to the gauge bosons will be completely dominated by the channel into the @xmath0 bosons , since by that moment they will be fully resonant while the @xmath1 bosons will still severely affected by their perturbative decay .    finally , to conclude this section and achieve an overall complete picture of all the details , let us also estimate the transfer of energy from the inflaton to the gauge bosons . in particular , the total energy transferred to them just after the @xmath252-th scattering , @xmath456 , is given simply by @xmath457 where we have used the fact that the gauge bosons are non - relativistic and have 3 polarizations .",

    "this means that our analytical estimates of these transfers were biased , and a careful numerical study of the process is required . beyond backreaction",
    ", the strength of the resonance very quickly decreases due to the increased frequency of oscillations of the higgs .",
    "eventually , the broad resonance driving the production of gauge bosons and thus their decay into sm particles becomes a narrow resonance and finally shuts off . from then on ,",
    "the inflaton will oscillate like a matter field while the produced particle will redshift as radiation , its effect on the expansion becoming negligible after a few hundred oscillations .",
    "we have studied the different stages of reheating after inflation in a model where the role of the inflaton is played by the higgs field of the standard model of particle physics with a non - minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "inflation in this model takes place at the gut scale , along the lines of the starobinsky model of inflation since a conformal transformation makes these two models indistinguishable from the point of view of inflation .",
    "the usual difficulty with large self couplings of the higgs is tamed here by the inclusion of a large non - minimal coupling to gravity , @xmath463 , which nevertheless does not leave any signature at low ( electroweak ) scales due to the fact that the higgs field acquires a vacuum expectation value and does not evolve at present , while the local spacetime curvature is negligible .    the advantage of this model of inflation for the study or reheating after inflation is that all the couplings of the higgs - inflaton to matter fields are known at the electroweak scale , and can be extrapolated to the gut scale using the renormalization group equations , and therefore one can study in detail the process of reheating of the universe , without having to impose ad hoc assumptions about their values .",
    "the surprise is that the process becomes more complicated than expected , and a series of subsequent stages take place , where essentially all different types of particle production mechanisms at preheating occur .",
    "moreover , since the standard model couplings of the higgs to gauge and matter fields are non - negligible , nor are their couplings among themselves , the process of non - perturbative decay via parametric resonance is mixed with the usual perturbative decays of the decay products , which complicates things significantly .",
    "inflation ends at values of the higgs field of order the planck scale and goes through a brief stage of tachyonic preheating soon after the end of inflation .",
    "the passage is so short that particle production is not significant at that stage .",
    "the same occurs with the production at the inflection point .",
    "finally the higgs - inflaton field starts oscillating around the minimum of its potential with a curvature scale of order @xmath464 gev . at this stage ,",
    "particle production occurs whenever the higgs passes through zero , creating mostly vector gauge bosons @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these gauge bosons acquire a large mass while the higgs increases towards maximum amplitude and start to decay into all standard model leptons and quarks within half a higgs oscillation , rapidly depleting the occupation numbers of gauge bosons , like in instant preheating .",
    "however , the fraction of energy of the higgs that goes into sm particles is still very small compared with the energy in the oscillations , and therefore the non - perturbative decay is slow .",
    "this implies that a relatively large number of oscillations take place before a significant amount of energy is transferred to the gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "the amplitude of higgs boson oscillations decreases as the universe expands in a matter - like dominated stage with zero pressure .",
    "eventually , this amplitude is small enough that the gauge boson masses are not large enough for inducing a quick decay of the gauge bosons and these start to build up their occupation numbers very rapidly via parametric amplification .",
    "the question whether this effect can give rise to the production of a significant gravitational wave background ( gwb ) potentially observable today remains to be addressed .",
    "several papers have studied recently such an issue in the chaotic and hybrid models of inflation  @xcite , but in the present model , we do nt have simply a parametric resonance phenomena but a combined preheating effect which , perhaps , could modify the properties of such a gwb .",
    "similar arguments would affect also the production of magnetic fields at preheating  @xcite or even electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "after about a hundred oscillations the gauge bosons produced backreact on the higgs field and the resonant production of particles stops .",
    "the higgs field acquires a large mass via its interaction with the gauge condensate and preheating ends . from there on , both higgses and gauge fields decay perturbatively until their energy is transferred to sm particles .",
    "since the stage after backreaction is very non - linear and non - perturbative , it can not be solved analytically and we have to resort to numerical studies in the lattice . we leave the description of our numerical studies to a future publication .    : upon completion of this paper , we received through the arxiv the preprint of bezrukov et al .",
    "@xcite , where they also study preheating in the @xmath465msm .",
    "although the formalism is common to both , our conclusions are somewhat different from those of ref .",
    "we find that the higgs decay into gauge bosons is significantly faster , and that backreaction occurs much before thermalization .",

    "<S> we study the details of preheating in an inflationary scenario in which the standard model higgs , strongly non - minimally coupled to gravity , plays the role of the inflaton . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the universe does not reheat immediately through perturbative decays , but rather initiate a complex process in which perturbative and non - perturbative effects are mixed . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs condensate starts oscillating around the minimum of its potential , producing @xmath0 and @xmath1 gauge bosons non - perturbatively , due to violation of the so called adiabaticity condition . </S>",
    "<S> however , during each semi - oscillation , the created gauge bosons partially decay ( perturbatively ) into fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of the gauge bosons prevents the development of parametric resonance , since bosons can not accumulate significantly at the beginning . </S>",
    "<S> however , the energy transferred to the decay products of the bosons is not enough to reheat the universe , so after about a hundred oscillations , the resonance effects will eventually dominate over the perturbative decays . around the same time </S>",
    "<S> ( or slightly earlier ) , backreaction from the gauge bosons into the higgs condensate will also start to be significant . </S>",
    "<S> soon afterwards , the universe is filled with the remnant condensate of the higgs and a non - thermal distribution of fermions and bosons ( those of the sm ) , which redshift as radiation and matter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the distribution of the energy budget among all the species present at the time of backreaction . from there on until thermalization , </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the system is highly non - linear and non - perturbative , and will require a careful study via numerical simulations .    </S>",
