    "the hera - b experiment is a hadronic b - factory at desy , operating presently under lhc - like conditions , five years before startup of lhc .",
    "the muon detection system in hera - b is made up of three different types of gas proportional chambers : tube , pad and pixel  @xcite .",
    "the readout of the chambers is based on the asd-8 amplifier shaper discriminator chip developed by the university of pennsylvania  @xcite .",
    "strong restrictions on the gas choice are imposed by the harsh operating conditions .",
    "in addition to the high radiation load , resulting in an accumulated charge on a wire of up to 200 mc / cm per year , the muon chambers have to withstand the presence of heavily ionizing particles , neutrons , and low energy gammas .",
    "the first level trigger requires high hit efficiency and fast signal collection within the 96  ns time interval between two consecutive bunch crossings .    in section 2 , the requirements and limitations of the choice of gases for the muon system",
    "are explained and the chamber characteristics studied with several fast @xmath9-based mixtures are discussed .",
    "the overview of aging results from laboratory setups and experimental detectors for binary and ternary mixtures of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 is presented in section 3 . since it is not clear how to extrapolate aging results from laboratory setups , when irradiating a small region of the wire , to large areas of irradiation with hadronic particles , we have studied aging properties of aluminum proportional chambers operated with @xmath0 and @xmath1 mixtures with @xmath6 and @xmath10 sources and in 100  mev @xmath8-beam .",
    "the results of these aging tests performed in a variety of conditions are summarized in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "large area gaseous detectors operated under high intensity particle fluxes impose new requirements for gas selection .",
    "the hera - b muon system , with a total gas volume of 8  @xmath11 , puts rather stringent constraints on the gaseous medium to be used : extremely low aging , high sparkproofness , good electrical properties ( high drift velocity @xmath12 , convenient operating electric field e / p ) , good chemical properties ( non - flammable , non - poisonous ) . since it is necessary to replenish part of the gas to avoid contamination by air , the cost of the component gases is also an important issue for gas selection .    for a minimum working voltage ,",
    "noble gases are usually chosen since they require the lowest electric field intensities for avalanche formation .",
    "however , photons limit the attainable gas amplification in the @xmath2-operated counters to @xmath13 without encountering a permanent discharge induced by the photon - feedback mechanism taking place at the cathode . this problem can be remedied by the addition of gases , such as hydrocarbons , alcohols , @xmath5 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "these molecular additives act like quenchers and improve the operational stability of the counter by absorption of ultraviolet photons from the multiplication process , de - excitation of @xmath2 atoms  @xcite , and by the charge transfer mechanism prevent the neutralization of argon ions at the cathode , thus reducing electron emission through predissociation of quench gas ions  @xcite",
    ". some of the polyatomic gases will also effectively increase the total ionization by the penning effect .",
    "moreover , in pure @xmath2 the electron drift velocity is @xmath16 times lower than in @xmath3 , although their elastic cross sections are nearly identical .",
    "however , the addition of even small quantities ( @xmath170.1@xmath18 ) of a molecular gas increases the drift velocity in argon threefold and also alters the shape dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath19  @xcite . in general",
    ", the drift velocity @xmath12 varies inversely with the product of the total scattering cross - section @xmath20 and the square root of the mean electron energy @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the fast gas mixtures were achieved by adding to @xmath2 a polyatomic gas  ( usually a hydrocarbon or @xmath5 ) which effectively shifts the low energy part of the electron distribution function into the region of the ramsauer - townsend  ( r - t ) minimum , located at @xmath17 0.5  ev , of the momentum transfer and total electron scattering cross - section of @xmath2 .",
    "the cooling of the electron swarm occurs as the energetic electrons quickly transfer their energy to rotational and vibrational modes of the polyatomic gas , whose scattering cross - section has a large inelastic component to the right of the r - t minimum .",
    "furthermore , the cooling effect of a given gas in a high electric field gas amplification region need not be the same as it s cooling effect in the lower electric field drift region . as was shown in  @xcite , the very similar effects observed in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mixtures in the avalanche region are contrasted with different properties of these gases in the lower electric fields : @xmath5 is a much cooler gas than @xmath3 in the drift region , as is evidenced by the measured diffusion coefficients  @xcite .",
    "these results open the possibility of choosing a gas mixture to separately optimize the desired drift and gain behavior in a particular application .",
    "almost twenty years ago , @xmath4 has been proposed for high rate environments as a most effective additive to raise the drift velocity in noble gases .",
    "this gas obtains its large drift velocity because of the sizeable ramsauer - townsend dip in the elastic cross - section which coincides with a very large vibrational inelastic cross - section  @xcite . for the @xmath9(90:10 )",
    "mixture the electron drift velocity was found to exceed 10  cm/@xmath24 , which is twice as fast as for the conventional mixture @xmath22(90:10 )  @xcite .",
    "further increase of the @xmath4 fraction in @xmath9 mixtures tends to push the maximum drift velocity to the higher field region , but when the percentage of @xmath4 becomes larger than 20  @xmath18 , the @xmath12 is the same whatever the mixture , indicating that it s mainly controlled by the @xmath4 cross section  @xcite . the lower vibrational modes , as well as the lower - lying negative ion states of @xmath4 as compared to @xmath3 , may account for the superior drift properties of the @xmath9 mixtures compared to @xmath22  @xcite .    however , all binary @xmath9 mixtures have rather poor energy resolution , compared to @xmath22 , due to the production of negative ions  @xcite .",
    "the dissociative attachment processes in @xmath4 are the only mechanisms leading to negative ion ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) formation , via two broad and overlapping resonances located between 4.5 and 10  ev  @xcite , and can cause serious inefficiencies in the collection of electrons and degrade the position resolution .",
    "the main evidence for the electron attachment is the direct measurement of the effective ionization coefficient @xmath27 ; where @xmath8 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the electron impact ionization and electron attachment coefficients .",
    "the negative values of @xmath29 were observed in the drift region in pure @xmath4 , @xmath9(80:20 ) and @xmath30(80:18:2 ) mixtures .",
    "very interestingly , the electron thermalizing properties effected by substituting 10  @xmath18 of @xmath4 in the @xmath9(80:20 ) by 10  @xmath18 of @xmath5 virtually eliminates the electron attachment in @xmath31(80:10:10 ) mixture  @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the small @xmath4 quenching cross - sections of metastable @xmath2-states  @xcite , the @xmath9 mixtures are not sufficiently self - quenching and show an intolerable level of afterpulsing even at moderate gas amplifications  ( see also section 2.1 ) .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath2/hydrocarbon mixtures , where no significant afterpulsing was observed so far at moderate gas gains . at the same time , some of the @xmath23 mixtures are known to suffer from a low sparkproofness  @xcite , since the quenching ability of @xmath5 is smaller than that of hydrocarbons .",

    "these results are taken from refs .  @xcite . as can be seen from the curves ,",
    "the @xmath33 mixtures are significantly faster than @xmath34 for any given value of @xmath19",
    ". the use of @xmath0 could be more preferable for high - rate proportional chamber applications than @xmath33 mixtures , since the former shows fast rises in the drift velocity for the relatively low fields , with respect to the latter , and the mobilities of @xmath35 ions in @xmath2 are much higher than those in @xmath4 , which is desirable in terms of space charge effects  @xcite .",
    "an additional disadvantage of the @xmath33 mixture is the necessity to operate at high electric fields @xmath19 for a sufficient gas gain , resulting in exceedingly high voltages in the chamber .",
    "this could introduce a problem of electrostatic instability of anode wires in large chambers .",
    "furthermore , considerations of cost and safety led us to consider @xmath32 mixtures as a reasonable compromise between many experimental requirements .",
    "an optimization of the exact proportions of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 in the mixture was performed using the magboltz and garfield simulation programs . as a result of simulation , @xmath32 ( 74:20:6 ) and another mixture with a reduced @xmath3 content @xmath32 ( 67:30:3 )",
    "were chosen for muon detector operation .",
    "unfortunately , mixtures with hydrocarbons have a tendency to cause polymerization effects , while @xmath5 quencher has been proven to give a much longer lifetimes . however",
    ", addition of @xmath5 appreciably changes the drift properties of the @xmath31 mixture , compared to the case of @xmath32 ; reduces the maximum drift velocity , and shifts it to the higher field region .",
    "in practice , we chose @xmath31(65:30:5 ) mixture , as a fall back gas , if the aging criterion becomes dominant .    finally , in the @xmath32 ( 74:20:6 ) , @xmath32 ( 67:30:3 ) and @xmath31 ( 65:30:5 ) mixtures , electron attachment processes may complicate gas performance .",
    "however , the primary ionization in the chamber cell is large enough and more than compensates for any losses due to electron attachment , especially since only hit information is processed in the muon detector .      in this paper",
    ", we address the problem of gas selection and present the measured data only for tube chambers .",
    "the tube chamber is a closed - cell proportional wire chamber made from an aluminum profile  ( wall thickness 2  mm ) with a drift cell 14  @xmath36  12  mm@xmath37 in cross section .",
    "5 shows the schematic drawing of the tube chamber .",
    "a gold - plated tungsten wire of 45  @xmath38 m diameter and a length of nearly 3  m is stretched inside each cell and fixed mechanically with pins at the end of the chamber . in order to prevent efficiency losses due to dead spaces between cells ,",
    "the tube chamber consists of two layers , each having 16 drift cells , shifted with respect to each other by half a cell size .",
    "( 100,50 ) ( 40.0,8.0 )    ( 30,6 ) figure 5 : schematic drawing of the tube chamber .",
    "dimensions are ( 40,0 ) indicated in units of mm .",
    "firstly , we have collected the @xmath6 spectra for each mixture under study : @xmath0 ( 74:20:6 ) , @xmath0 ( 67:30:3 ) and @xmath1 ( 65:30:5 ) with a goal of inferring the response to minimum ionizing particles .",
    "measured pulse heights were converted to avalanche sizes , which correspond to the total number of electrons in the avalanche .",
    "the gas gain value can be obtained by dividing the observed pulse size by @xmath17 200 , the average number of primary electrons , if the mixture has no electron attachment .",
    "2 shows the total avalanche size increasing in an exponential manner with the high voltage , within the limits of the proportional region .",
    "it has been shown previously  @xcite that the onset of secondary gas effects such as space charge saturation may be detected as a break in the expected scaling of the gas gain with respect both to anode surface field and to gradient of the electric field near the wire .",
    "it should be noted that for these data taken with an @xmath6 source with its fixed initial charge ( @xmath17200 electrons ) , a particular value of gas gain is equivalent to a definite value of the total charge in the avalanche .",
    "space charge effects depend on the total avalanche size and distribution of the positive ion cloud .",
    "hence , these numerical results can not be automatically applied to other ionization sources with different magnitudes or distributions of the initial charge .",
    "secondly , the tube chamber characteristics have been studied on the 3  gev electron test beam at desy .",
    "the beam intensity was @xmath17  1  @xmath39 .",
    "the trigger was initiated by a coincidence of four beam - defining scintillator counters , between which the chamber was positioned . then , the number of events with at least one hit in the double layer chamber , within the 96  ns , versus the number of triggered events yields an efficiency .",
    "3 shows the measured efficiency for the mixtures being studied , as a function of high voltage .",
    "this figure demonstrates , that the actual efficiency is approximately 100  @xmath18 for the double layer chamber .",
    "however , for a single layer the usage of @xmath1(65:30:5 ) mixture results in about 7  @xmath18 of signals registered outside the 96  ns ( for perpendicular tracks ) , while in @xmath0 mixture nearly all signals are collected within the 96  ns . fig . 4 presents singles ( untriggered ) counting rates for a tube chamber cell as a function of high voltage . from these curves , wide high voltage plateaus for a stable and efficient operation with the @xmath0(74:20:6 ) , @xmath0(67:30:3 ) and @xmath1(65:30:5 ) gases are observed , where the counting rate is roughly uniform . real afterpulses and multiple hits of asd-8 per signal",
    "both contribute to the rise in singles rate curves , above the nominal beam intensity , with increasing high voltage . in comparison ,",
    "@xmath9(70:30 ) mixture will not guarantee stable and efficient operation over sufficient high - voltage range in the tube chambers .",
    "the difference in singles rate curves , and correspondingly in detection efficiency , between @xmath9(70:30 ) and @xmath0(67:30:3 ) may be attributed to the enhanced gas electron production efficiency and smaller electron attachment for the latter mixture . in addition ,",
    "onset of secondary avalanches in @xmath9 limit the maximum operating voltage to 2.5  kv  ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , thus causing a drastic decrease in the counting rate plateau width .    the results presented here justify the choice of @xmath0 ( 74:20:6 ) , @xmath0 ( 67:30:3 ) and @xmath1 ( 65:30:5 ) gases for muon detection with high efficiency .",
    "aging effects in proportional wire chambers , a permanent degradation of operating characteristics under sustained irradiation , has been and remains the main limitation to their use in high - rate experiments  @xcite .",
    "many processes are expected to occur simultaneously in the gaseous discharges surrounding the wire and it is nearly impossible to obtain a quantitative chemical description in each particular case .",
    "there is much experimental information , excellently summarized in  @xcite , that suggests the wire chambers lifetime could be affected , and in some cases dramatically , by the nature and purity of the gas mixture , materials used in contact with the gas , by different additives , and trace contaminants .",
    "while the specific reactions responsible for wire chamber aging are extremely complex , a qualitative description of the aging phenomena in different gases could be obtained from similarities between chemical processes in wire chamber avalanches and those that occur in the better - understood low - pressure rf - plasmas  @xcite . during wire avalanches many molecules",
    "break up by collisions with electrons , de - excitation of atoms , and uv - photon absorption processes .",
    "whereas most ionization processes require electron energies greater than 10  ev , the breaking of the chemical bonds in molecules and formation of free radicals requires only 3 - 4  ev , and could lead to a large abundance of free radicals over the ions in the wire avalanches .",
    "similar to plasma polymerization  @xcite , a free - radical polymerization seems to be the most appropriate mechanism of the wire chamber aging .",
    "since free radicals are chemically very active they will either recombine back to original molecules or other volatile species , or form new cross - linked molecular structures , which could react further to produce chain - like polymers of increasing molecular weight , thus lowering the volatility of the resulting product .",
    "when the growing of polymerized chain becomes large enough for condensation to occur , it will diffuse to the electrode surface .",
    "the polymer deposition mechanism can be conceived as a phenomenon that occurs whenever the gaseous species fails to bounce back on collision with a electrode surface , including a surface of particles already formed in the gas discharges .",
    "initially the polymer could be held to the surface very weakly , unless some additional chemical reaction takes place between the polymer atoms and atoms of the wire material .",
    "furthermore , many free radicals are expected to have permanent or induced dipole moments ; therefore , electrostatic attraction to a wire could play a significant role in the polymer deposition process .",
    "thus , aging effects in gaseous detectors would lead to deposition of thin , very high quality polymers on the anode wires , and would result in a loss of the gas gain and degradation of ionization measurements .",
    "deposits on cathodes can induce discharges by secondary electron emission ( or malter effect  @xcite ) , and would lead to chamber breakdown .",
    "traditionally , the aging rate was parameterized as a normalized gas gain loss  @xcite :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is an initial gas gain , @xmath42 is the loss of gas gain after collected charge @xmath43 per unit length .",
    "the parameterization used above implicitly assumes that the gain drop depends linearly on the charge collected per unit length of the wire , and that the aging rate is only a function of the total collected charge , independent of gas gain and radiation intensity . in reality , this assumption is not fulfilled .",
    "several examples in the literature  @xcite clearly indicate that the degree of aging for a given radiation dose could also depend upon the mode of operation , being larger for smaller current densities , other conditions being held constant .",
    "these observations raise a question on the relevance of aging results , obtained in accelerated aging tests with extremely high current densities , extrapolated to normal conditions .",
    "moreover , aging studies of atlas muon drift tubes , have shown a strong dependence of the aging rate on the mode of operation ( irradiation rate , high voltage ) and size of the irradiated area  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been found that the aging rate in the hera - b honeycomb tracker chambers varies substantially , when changing from @xmath44 irradiation to heavy ionizing particles  ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "this paper presents evidence that the aging rate for irradiation with 5.9  kev @xmath7-rays and 100  mev @xmath8 s may differ by more than two orders of magnitude  ( see sections 4 and 5 ) .",
    "furthermore , it was recently reported in  @xcite and it will be shown in a subsequent paper  @xcite , that the rate of polymer deposition could also be affected by the mode of operation , size of the irradiated area and water addition .",
    "these results exclude the possibility to extrapolate aging rates obtained in the laboratory setups by irradiating a small region of the wire to the large areas of irradiation in hadronic environment .",
    "therefore , for each particular case , the final decision for long - term stability of operation should be taken only after obtaining similar performance in conditions as close as possible to real ones .      over the last few decades ,",
    "an impressive variety of experimental data has been accumulated and it is not feasible to go through all published results .",
    "in addition , new results make doubtful the quantitative comparison of aging properties , realized at very different conditions .",
    "therefore , we will present below only a brief summary of the most recent data , focusing on the binary and ternary mixtures , containing @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "there are a lot of reports that clearly indicate premature aging in @xmath22 filled wire chambers exposed to intense radiation  @xcite .",
    "the polymerization of @xmath3 is attributed to the hydrogen deficiency of radicals and their ability to make bonds with hydrocarbon molecules  @xcite , leading to the buildup of deposits on the anode wires , which usually contain carbon and lighter elements .",
    "attempts were made to replace the organic quenchers with more stable ones , such as @xmath5 .",
    "however , the gradual decomposition of @xmath5 in @xmath23 mixtures also takes place and stable operation was found to be possible up to charges of 0.5 - 0.7  @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , carbon dioxide is also known for its carbon buildup , which occurs specifically at the cathode  @xcite , however , this carbon layer did not affect the performance of the drift tubes  @xcite .",
    "another effect , which is enhanced in @xmath23 mixtures compared to gases containing hydrocarbon quenchers , is the spurious counting rate  ( noise ) , that presumably comes from the spikes on the wires .",
    "this noise can be cured by the addition of water vapor to the drift gas  @xcite .",
    "the aging studies in the ternary mixtures @xmath46 indicate the dependence of the aging rate on the particular set of operating conditions , in some cases being smaller for larger @xmath3 content in the mixture  @xcite .",
    "the stable operation far beyond 0.6  @xmath45 was observed for @xmath47 ( 94:3:2:1 ) + 1200  @xmath48 of @xmath14 mixture , however , some conditions where found were only a tenth of nominal lifetime was achieved  @xcite . moreover , for the @xmath47 mixture , measurements have shown that their sensitivity to aging decreases with decreasing @xmath3 and increasing @xmath5 content .",
    "the use of gases having @xmath4 as a component was found to be attractive in the plasma processes , since the @xmath4 is an ideal source for a variety of reactive neutral and ionic fragment atoms and molecules , and especially neutral fluor , which is a desirable active species in etching processes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 molecule is relatively inert in its electronic ground state , but all excited electronic states of @xmath4 and @xmath49 ion lead to dissociation .",
    "below the onset of electronic excitations , which is rather high - 12.5  ev , collisions of electrons with @xmath4 molecule lead to elastic scattering , vibrational excitation and dissociative attachment . above this energy ,",
    "dissociation of the @xmath4 into neutrals or charged fragments becomes significant  @xcite .",
    "actually , in plasma environment @xmath4-based gases are used for both etching and deposition processes , the distinction being made by the gas and its amount with which @xmath4 is mixed .",
    "the balance between these processes is called competitive ablation and polymerization. in general , the addition of oxygenated species shifts the chemistry of @xmath4 plasmas toward etching , while the addition of hydrogenated species shifts the chemistry toward polymerization  @xcite . for example , the polymer formation by @xmath4 plasmas in the presence of @xmath3 was observed  @xcite .    in the wire chamber operation ,",
    "the usage of @xmath4 is also quite controversial .",
    "many studies have demonstrated excellent aging properties , up to 10  @xmath45 , of @xmath50 ( 80:20 ) avalanches  @xcite , which also has an ability to etch both silicon - based  @xcite and hydrocarbon  @xcite deposits from the previously aged gold - plated wires .",
    "however , another proportions of @xmath4 and isobutane could totally change the chemical reactions on the surface of the anode wire .",
    "heavy carbonaceous deposits were formed on the gold - plated wires irradiated in the mixtures @xmath50 ( 95:5 ) and @xmath50 ( 20:80 ) .",
    "the absence of fluorocarbon deposits on the anode wires indicates that the deposits were formed only from @xmath51 , without incorporation of @xmath52 fragments .",
    "details of the chemical model and aging results in the @xmath50 are presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "another gas observed to form heavy carbonaceous anode deposits was @xmath53(95:5 )  @xcite . at the same time , the 4 @xmath18 addition of @xmath4 has been shown to inhibit anode damage in @xmath54(50:50 ) mixture up to the doses of 1.5  @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "aging studies have been also performed with the @xmath33 ( 90:10 ) gas mixture and no deterioration was found up to 1.9  c / cm of the wire  @xcite .",
    "finally , it should be noted , that most of the aging studies in the @xmath4/hydrocarbon mixtures , were performed by irradiating a small region of the wire under well controlled laboratory conditions . at the same time , several painful experiences with aging are known from the high energy experiments .",
    "the d0 muon drift chambers , filled with @xmath32(80:10:10 ) undergo a fast aging when operated in a radiation environment .",
    "vapors from a glue used in the construction were deposited on the wires in a sheath , with the deposition rate proportional to accumulated charge  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , operation in the high - rate hadronic hera - b environment showed that the aging rate could depend on the type of ionization and size of the irradiated area  @xcite .",
    "the severe anode and cathode aging effects were observed in the honeycomb chambers tested in the hera - b conditions with @xmath33(80:20 ) and @xmath32(74:20:6 ) mixtures after the radiation dose of several @xmath55 per @xmath56 of the wire .",
    "this effect was surprising since the chambers were proved to be immune a very large @xmath7-ray doses , up to the 5  c / cm of the wire .",
    "the aging properties of the gas mixtures @xmath57 , which by analogy with plasma experiments should provide etching environments in the wire avalanches , have been also widely investigated over the past years .",
    "the radiation tests of the atlas straw tubes using @xmath58 mixture showed no signs of aging for a integrated charge of up to 8  @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed examination of anode wires and straw walls ( cathode ) after irradiation had shown evidence for the etching processes on both surfaces  @xcite .",
    "another interesting phenomena was found in straw tubes irradiated under exceedingly high current densities in @xmath58 mixture .",
    "after an accumulated charge of 9  @xmath59 the ` anode swelling effect ' was observed , where destruction of gold coating of the gold - plated tungsten wires , followed by the tungsten oxidation  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was also reported  @xcite , that under a high radiation intensity in @xmath1 ( 65:30:5 ) mixture , gold - plating of tungsten wires can be etched away completely exposing the tungsten .",
    "however , the addition of water to the @xmath1 ( 65:30:5 ) was found to reduce the rate of etching processes , and the honeycomb chambers were able to survive radiation doses of up to 2  @xmath45 .",
    "the chemical etching processes in the @xmath1 are likely to be responsible for the enhanced removal of the diamond coating observed in msgc - gem chambers  @xcite .",
    "amazingly , extremely rapid aging has been observed for pure @xmath4 and in @xmath60(50:40:10 ) mixture , which were expected to have strong etching abilities  @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the aging process was related to chemical processes at the cathode , where trace fluorocarbon deposits were found .",
    "this type of aging phenomena was found to be cathode - material - dependent , and resulted in a loss of gas gain rather than in a self - sustained discharge .",
    "for the latter case , although @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 elements were observed on the anode wire , it is likely that the rapid aging was as a result of the same ( cathode phenomenon ) observed in pure @xmath4 .",
    "the fluorination of the anode wires , found after exposure in @xmath60(50:40:10 ) avalanches , can cause anode aging in addition to cathode effects  @xcite .",
    "a further phenomena due to the consistency of the cathode surfaces was observed in atlas aluminum drift tubes operated in @xmath64 ( 94.5:0.5:2:3 ) . here , no change in gas gain for the tubes was found up to an accumulated charge of 5  @xmath45 . however , the increased count rate at the beginning of the tests , due to afterpulses in this gas at high gains decreased with the time to the level , when no significant afterpulsing was observed .",
    "this reduction was suggested to be due to the increased layer of fluor and oxygen found at the cathode  @xcite .",
    "similar effects were also found during the long - term irradiation of drift tubes with stainless steel cathodes in pure @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "these aging results clearly demonstrate that the presence of large amounts of @xmath4 in the mixture does not necessarily ensure good aging properties .",
    "moreover , perfluorocarbons represent the most extreme case of ablation competing with polymer formation .",
    "therefore , all attempts to improve the aging performance of the mixtures by adding @xmath4 must be tested in the actual environment .",
    "an abundance of literature exists describing the effect of certain additives with oxygen - containing groups , like water , alcohol , methylal , oxygen .",
    "these components , added to the mixture in small concentrations , usually ( but not always ) extend the chamber lifetime , especially against the polymerization of hydrocarbons .",
    "of special interest is the addition of water vapors , that has been found to suppress effectively polymerization in wire chambers  @xcite , to prevent malter breakdowns  @xcite , or even to restore the original operation in aged counters  @xcite ; a few hundred to a few thousand @xmath48 of water are generally used .",
    "the most natural mechanism by which water impedes malter breakdowns and significantly improves the analog response of the aged counters comes from the fact that water tends to increase the conductivity of the damaged electrodes  @xcite .",
    "in addition , water could effectively suppress the secondary photon - mediated phenomena , if the uv photons from carbon excitations are responsible for the photoionization at the cathode  @xcite . at the same time , the exact mechanism by which water stops or reduces the aging rate in wire chambers is not clearly understood .",
    "one possible explanation could be gained from the similarities with plasma chemistry , where water acts like a blocking agent of the chain growth mechanism , reacting with polymer precursors , thereby decreasing the concentration of free radicals available for polymerization  @xcite .",
    "another explanation is that water , due to its large dipole moment , could effectively slow - down electrons in the avalanches making the mixture ` cooler ' . in this case , aging effects resulting from free radical polymerization would be reduced , since fewer radicals would be formed in the wire avalanches . finally , it is well established , that aging effects in the wire chambers , even when they are entirely due to polymerization of gas mixture components can be accelerated by the discharges  ( glow discharges of sparks ) and photoelectric feedback  @xcite .",
    "these effects are strongly dependent on the quality and type of the electrodes : surfaces of anode wire or cathode could be rather imperfect , thus , ` triggering ' polymerization in wire chambers .",
    "known remedies for aging in this case are also water and alcohols , which may prolong the lifetime considerably .",
    "furthermore , aging can be initiated by the trace contaminants such as @xmath65 , halogens  ( other than @xmath4 ) , sulfur , phthalats , benzine rings , which are either initially present in the gas , or result from outgassing of solid materials in contact with gas .",
    "the detailed summary of the influence of commonly used materials on aging properties may be found in  @xcite . when constructing large systems , one should before to certify the gas purity and chemical reactivity of various materials in order to avoid the presence of bad molecules in contact with the active gas volume .",

    "the irradiated area was limited by a collimator to about 30  mm of the wire for the @xmath6 source and to 10  mm for the @xmath10 source . while the @xmath6 5.9  kev @xmath7-rays produce an ionization cluster in the chamber cell , corresponding to @xmath17  200 primary electrons , the @xmath10 source provides 3.54  mev electrons from the decay of @xmath67 , which leaves an ionization track with @xmath17  90 primary electrons per cm .",
    "the degree of aging was determined quantitatively by comparing @xmath6 spectra , measured at the irradiated and reference positions of the wire , using the same electronics chain .",
    "this method removed problems arising from the @xmath6 peak position movement due to changes in the pressure , the temperature , and gas mixture itself .",
    "the total collected charge was determined by integrating continuously the recorded anode current .",
    "the gas flow rate was 1  liter / hour for all tests .",

    "for irradiation with the @xmath10 source , the high voltages for operation in @xmath0 ( 67:30:3 )  ( @xmath1 ( 65:30:5 ) ) mixtures were set to 2690  v ( 2790  v ) , corresponding to current densities of 1.2  @xmath69 ( 0.9  @xmath69 ) .",
    "the different current densities for the irradiation of @xmath0 ( 67:30:3 ) and @xmath1 ( 65:30:5 ) mixtures is attributed to the reduced source strength for the latter case , due to the larger thickness of @xmath66 foil used as a cathode above the irradiated region of the wire .",
    "the high voltages used during the aging studies already exceed the proportional mode of gas amplification , therefore , events with higher pulse heights than those in the proportional mode also appear at these voltages .",

    "such a rate of gas gain losses could be acceptable for the long - term operation of the muon chambers in hera - b .",
    "however , after a collected charge @xmath17 1  @xmath59 significant self - sustained dark current appeared in addition to those normally associated with radiation .",
    "this dark current persisted even after the removal of the radiation source , but it was totally quenched , either by a large increase in the gas flow rate , from 1  liter / hour to 10  liters / hour  ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , or by turning off the high voltage .",
    "this phenomena is associated with the polymer coating and subsequent charge buildup on the cathode surface , by a mechanism similar to the well known malter discharge  @xcite .",
    "irradiation with the @xmath10 source of @xmath0 ( 67:30:3 ) and @xmath1 ( 65:30:5 ) mixtures led to @xmath72 values consistent with zero  ( see fig .",
    "such promising aging behavior make these gases suitable candidates for use in the tube chambers .",
    "unfortunately , as will be reported in section 5 , the aging results , obtained in the high - rate hadronic environment when irradiating a large area chamber differ significantly from those described above .",
    "after the tests with radioactive sources , aging studies with the @xmath0 ( 74:20:6 ) mixture were carried out by irradiating a single layer tube chamber in a 100  mev @xmath8-beam in karlsruhe  ( see fig . 8) . due to the small range of the 100  mev @xmath8 s in aluminum , the thickness of the @xmath66-wall",
    "was reduced to @xmath17 200  @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath8-beam intensity was almost uniform over the beam area 8  @xmath36  8  @xmath74 .",
    "this allowed a constant irradiation of four wires fully , and , in addition , two wires were exposed over half of their cell width .",
    "all wires were equipped for analog readout .",
    "furthermore , for one of wires , which we will call a ` reference wire ' , two holes were made in the chamber wall - within the region of irradiation and outside of it .",
    "both holes were closed with kapton foil . for the ` reference wire ' , it was possible to measure the degree of aging by comparing the @xmath6 spectra at the two positions of the same wire .    a premixed gas mixture of @xmath0(74:20:6 )",
    "was transported by stainless - steel tubes connected directly to the tube chamber inlet and outlet .",
    "the gas flow was in serial inside a chamber from one cell to another , with the flow rate about 6  liters / hour .",
    "the operating voltage was set to 2.35 kv , corresponding to a gas gain @xmath75 , measured with @xmath6 @xmath7-rays . the radiation intensity varied during the aging studies by a factor of 3 , thus excluding any possibility to investigate aging behavior as a function of rate .",
    "therefore , the current densities were in the range @xmath17  250  na / cm up to 750  na / cm . by monitoring the chamber current , the total collected charge was determined",
    ".    since the average energy losses of @xmath8-particles in the chamber cell are much larger than those of @xmath7-rays , the same avalanche size as that for @xmath7-rays is obtained at a lower voltage . in practice , at an applied voltage of 2.35  kv , the total charge released from @xmath8-particles was measured to be a factor of 10 - 15 larger than that corresponding to a 5.9  kev @xmath7-ray localized energy deposition in proportional mode . moreover , the signals from @xmath8 s at this voltage were also accompanied by self - quenching streamer discharges , observed in several percent of the events at this voltage .",
    "this may be explained by the fact that since the transformation from proportional to streamer mode depends upon the primary ionization density  @xcite , heavily ionizing particles should enter the self - quenching streamer mode at lower voltages than @xmath6 @xmath7-rays and minimum ionizing particles .",

    "all other irradiated wires were also studied on the electron beam .",
    "wires that have been exposed to a charge of 280  @xmath76 were found to be heavily damaged , showing an efficiency at the level of  @xmath171  @xmath18 - 10  @xmath18 for the nominal operating high voltage 2.35  kv .",

    "after the beam tests , the chamber was opened for inspection and both anode wires and cathodes surfaces were analyzed , using microscope and later scanning electron microscopy  ( sem ) .",

    "examination of all damaged wires by sem revealed deposits , containing carbon and fluorine as the only detectable elements , thus confirming the presence of a polymer coating .",

    "10 shows , as an example , the sem of the ` reference wire ' after the accumulated charge of 60  @xmath76 . new wires and wires which were exposed to the irradiated gas , but",
    "not irradiated themself , showed peaks only from au .",
    "unfortunately , this method is unable to detect hydrogen , so hydrocarbons registered as a carbon alone and are also trapped in the polymer coating .",
    "sem analysis of the cathode surface composition in the irradiated region of the wire after exposure to 280  @xmath76 was also performed .",
    "translation of peak areas into atomic abundances indicates that the top layer of the cathode consists mainly of @xmath66(@xmath79 ) with some traces of carbon and oxygen  ( see fig .",
    "a direct means of investigating the radiation - initiated spark discharges was to separate anode and cathode effects by combining new and aged portions of the tube chamber . when the cathodes of the tubes that had been previously aged were restrung with the new anode wires , the breakdown knee in the singles rate displaced to the higher voltages",
    ". therefore , one reason for the discharges are some local deposits on the anode wires  ( conductive ` whiskers ' ) .",
    "it was reported by holland  @xcite , that the properties of polymer films can be electrically conductive or insulating according to the carbon to hydrogen ratio and a degree of cross - linking .",
    "if a coating is primarily carbon , rather than normal polymers , the conductivity will be much higher . at the same time , the energy and amount of particle bombardment on the surface can very easily change the composition and therefore conductivity .",
    "hydrogen can be easily removed by ion bombardment , so heavy bombardment leads to a more carbonaceous than polymer - like deposit , which may be relevant for the case of irradiation with @xmath8-particles .",
    "experimental conditions at hera - b impose very strong requirements for the gaseous detectors .",
    "the high radiation load of the hera - b experiment results in an accumulated charge of up to 200  @xmath76 in the tube chambers .",
    "the chamber signals , which are used to form the trigger , must be collected in less than the 96  ns between bunch crossings .",
    "a short description of the criteria which are relevant for the choice of gases in the hera - b muon detector are discussed and the tube chamber characteristics studied for several @xmath9-based mixtures are reported",
    ". however , the main criteria for the choice of the gases are the aging properties . in this paper ,",
    "the brief summary of the most recent data focusing on the binary and ternary mixtures , containing @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 is presented .",
    "although , @xmath4 gas has been widely used over the last ten years , the results from it s usage in the drift tubes are quite controversial .",
    "the aging results reported in this paper demonstrate that the aging rate for irradiation with 5.9  kev @xmath7-rays and 100  mev @xmath8 s may differ by more than two orders of magnitude . despite the negligible gas gain loss measured after the long - term irradiation with @xmath6 @xmath7-rays , rapid aging effects observed with @xmath8-particles completely ruled out @xmath0 ( 74:20:6 ) mixture as a candidate for operation in the hera - b high radiation environment , where at least part of the ionization is deposited by heavily ionizing particles .",
    "moreover , from these results it is evident that from the accumulated charge alone , it is not possible to combine the data from the different radiation sources into one consistent model .",
    "therefore , as long as the data from different aging tests can not be combined properly , it is very difficult to give an extrapolation about the lifetime in the real detector . in order to find a link between results in different setups",
