    "since the discovery of carbon nanotubes in the early 1990s@xcite , the field has witnessed an immense growth . due to the small diameter ( @xmath3 nm ) , nanotubes are ideal candidates to study one - dimensional electrical transport phenomena , even at room temperature . in particular ,",
    "single - walled carbon nanotubes , which consist of a single layer of graphene sheet wrapped up to form a seamless tube@xcite , possess exceptional electrical properties , such as high current carrying capability@xcite and excellent carrier mobility@xcite . both theory and experiments have demonstrated that these tubes can be either metallic or semiconducting , depending on the chirality of their atomic structure with respect to the tube axis . using semiconducting nanotubes , carbon nanotube field effect transistors ( cnfets )",
    "have been first realized and reported in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "these early cnfets , however , showed poor device characteristics .",
    "since then , remarkable progress has been made to improve the performance of cnfets by approaches such as : ( 1 ) reducing the gate oxide thickness@xcite ; ( 2 ) adopting high-@xmath4 dielectrics for the gate oxide@xcite ; ( 3 ) using electrolyte as the gate @xcite ; ( 4 ) reducing contact resistance by choosing proper contact metals@xcite or post - process treatments@xcite .",
    "these techniques have significantly advanced cnfet devices to exhibit characteristics rivaling those of state - of - the - art si - based mosfets . with the scaling limit of conventional cmos in sight@xcite ,",
    "carbon nanotubes show great promise among the materials investigated so far for post - si technology .",
    "most cnfets studied so far have adopted a back - gate , top - contact geometry ( see @xcite and @xcite for a review ) , as shown in fig.[thinoxcnfet](a ) . in this back - gate configuration ,",
    "the nanotubes are dispersed or grown on a conducting substrate covered by an insulating layer .",
    "two metal contacts are deposited on the nanotube to serve as source and drain electrodes , while the conducting substrate is the gate electrode in this three - terminal device .",
    "this cnfet structure , albeit simple , has been extensively studied to provide invaluable insights and understanding of fundamental properties of nanotubes .",
    "however , these cnfets are found to possess several unfavorable features that severely constrain their usefulness in vital applications such as cmos - like circuits . in order to address the disadvantages of a simple back - gated cnfet , in this report we present a novel device concept for cnfets . in particular , our device design is capable of producing pure @xmath0- and/or @xmath1-type cnfets with improved off - state performance and abrupt switching behavior close to theoretical limits .",
    "first we review important electrical characteristics of the back - gated cnfet as shown in fig.[thinoxcnfet](a ) .",
    "the understanding of operation principles and physics of this device is indispensable in order to obtain desired functionality and further improvements .",
    "figure[thinoxcnfet](b ) shows the subthreshold characteristics , the drain current @xmath5 measured as a function of gate voltage @xmath6 , of a back - gated cnfet for different drain voltages ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "for all the measurements presented in this report , the source electrode is grounded .",
    "this cnfet device is fabricated on a heavily @xmath1-doped si substrate covered by a thin layer ( 10-nm thick ) of thermally - grown sio@xmath8 with titanium ( ti ) contacts . in fig.[thinoxcnfet](b ) , two distinct features are observed .",
    "first , as the gate voltage increases from negative values , the current decreases , reaching a minimum value of @xmath9 , and @xmath10a for @xmath11 , -0.4 , and -0.7v , respectively , and then rises again , exhibiting an ambipolar transistor characteristic .",
    "second , as the drain bias becomes more negative , the minimum current @xmath12 increases exponentially and the gate voltage corresponding to this minimum current shifts to more negative values , showing a strong @xmath13-dependent @xmath12 .    in order to understand the results of fig.[thinoxcnfet](b ) , figures[bands2](a ) and ( b ) depict schematic band diagrams of a cnfet for negative and positive @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "we note that , different from a conventional mosfet , switching of a cnfet is dominated by the modulation of schottky barriers ( sbs ) formed at the nanotube / metal contacts@xcite .",
    "as indicated in figs.[bands2](a ) and ( b ) , at sufficiently negative and positive gate voltages , schottky barriers are effectively thinned to enable hole injection ( @xmath14 ) from the source and electron injection ( @xmath15 ) from the drain contact into the nanotube , respectively .",
    "compared to the tunneling phenomena in a 3d bulk device , this tunneling current in cnfets can be quite significant because a barrier width ( @xmath16 depletion length @xmath17 ) as small as a couple of nanometers can be obtained for a ultra - thin body object , such as a nanotube , when thin gate dielectrics are used@xcite .",
    "we also notice that in fig.[bands2 ] , there is little band bending in the nanotube body because the carrier mean - free - path in nanotubes can be as long as @xmath18 nm even at room temperature  @xcite , so that carrier transport is nearly ballistic for the nanotube channel length ( @xmath19 nm ) considered here . in fig.[thinoxcnfet](b ) , the left and right current branches with respect to the minimum current @xmath12 are therefore contributions by hole and electron currents , and are referred to in the following as @xmath1- and @xmath0-branches , respectively . at the minimum current @xmath20 , the hole current is equal to the electron current . since the electron current is due to the tunneling at the drain contact , the @xmath0-branch exhibits a much stronger @xmath7 dependence than the @xmath1-branch ( see fig.[bands2 ] for two different @xmath7 ) , resulting in a @xmath6 shift of the @xmath0-branch as a function of @xmath7 and a strongly @xmath13-dependent @xmath12 as shown in fig.[thinoxcnfet](b ) .",
    "all these electrical characteristics of cnfets have been studied previously , and detailed discussions can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "both simulations and experimental results have shown that the switching performance of cnfets , measured by the inverse subthreshold slope @xmath21 , and the on - state current can be improved by decreasing the gate oxide thickness@xcite .",
    "however , the enhanced gate control in a cnfet always also results in a higher @xmath12 with a more pronounced @xmath7 dependence as explained before@xcite .",
    "in addition , from application s point of view , both @xmath0 and @xmath1-type transistors with unipolar characteristics are required for cmos - like logic circuits , while thin - oxide cnfets are usually ambipolar , as shown in fig.[thinoxcnfet](b ) . in order to advance nanotubes for future transistor technology",
    ", these disadvantages associated with vertical scaling have to be overcome .",
    "we have recently demonstrated the conversion of an ambipolar cnfet to a unipolar transistor using a partially - gated structure where a trench is created near one of the contacts to eliminate drain leakage@xcite .",
    "however , it was also found that this partially - gated structure results in a reduced on - current and is not suitable for scaling to small lateral lengths due to fringing field impacts .    in this report , we present a novel device concept for cnfets using dual gates to eliminate ambipolar characteristics and create pure @xmath0- and/or @xmath1-type devices with excellent off - state performance and a steep subthreshold swing .",
    "this is achieved by a combination of electrostatic and/or chemical doping along the tube channel . by introducing a distinct @xmath22 or @xmath23 band structure along the nanotube (",
    "where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 represent an @xmath0-doped , a @xmath1-doped , and an undoped ( intrinsic ) nanotube segment , respectively ) , we have successfully modified the switching mechanism of our cnfet@xcite . instead of contact switching by modulating schottky barriers",
    ", our device operates by varying the band potential in the middle portion of the nanotube body , called bulk - switching , and achieves an inverse subthreshold slope @xmath26mv / dec , the smallest value reported for cnfets to date .",
    "furthermore , this unique device structure affords aggressive gate length scaling without deteriorated device performance .",
    "figure[dblgate ] shows the sem image as well as the device cross - section of a cnfet with the proposed dual - gate structure@xcite .",
    "different from the back - gated cnfet shown in fig.[thinoxcnfet](a ) , the dual - gate cnfet possesses an additional al gate electrode placed underneath the nanotube between the source and drain contacts . to fabricate the dual - gate cnfet ,",
    "the al gate ( 20-nm thick and @xmath27-nm wide ) is first deposited on a @xmath1-doped si substrate covered with 10-nm - thick sio@xmath8 , followed by the oxidation of al metal in moisturized oxygen at @xmath28c for 1.5 hours to form a thin layer of al@xmath8o@xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) . both c - v and ellipsometry measurements of the al@xmath8o@xmath29 layer indicate an oxide thickness of about 4 nm , in agreement to the result reported in ref .",
    "nanotubes produced by laser ablation  @xcite with an average diameter of @xmath31 nm are then spun onto the substrate from solution . finally , source / drain contacts made of ti are deposited on the nanotube , each with a spacing of @xmath27 nm relative to the al gate . for the following discussions , the al gate region is denoted as region b , and the area between the al gate and the source / drain contacts are denoted as regions a ( see fig.[dblgate ] ) .    in our design ,",
    "the al gate is the primary gate that governs the electrostatics and the switching of the nanotube bulk channel in region b , while the schottky barriers at the nanotube / metal contacts are controlled by the si back gate ( substrate ) , which also prevents the electrostatics in region a from being influenced by the al gate .",
    "it was previously observed that carrier injection at the contacts may still be modulated by a middle gate due to fringing field impacts@xcite . to verify that the schottky barriers at the contacts are not affected by the al gate voltages in our design , figure[bgfloating ]",
    "shows the measured current as a function of al gate voltage @xmath32 when the si back gate @xmath33 is kept floating .",
    "we find that our device is always off with a low current in the noise level ( @xmath34pa ) , independent of @xmath32 , indicating an insignificant impact of the al gate fields at the contact regions .",
    "the result in fig.[bgfloating ] implies that our cnfet can operate as a bulk - switched transistor rather than an sb - cnfet since the switching using the al gate does not impact the contact schottky barriers .",
    "cnfets with potential profiles similar to our device have been previously fabricated by using one or more middle gates on top of the nanotube@xcite . in those cnfets",
    ", the nanotube is sandwiched between the top gate(s ) and the back gate , and the back gate field still contributes to the electrostatics inside the nanotube , resulting in a lower efficiency of the top gate when the back gate is kept at any constant voltage@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the nanotube potential of region b in our design is exclusively determined by the al gate because the al metal layer screens the field from the si gate , giving rise to an ideal switching behavior .",
    "another important advantage of our design is the possibility of introducing a well - defined chemical doping profile along the nanotube to further tailor transistor characteristics ( see sec.[sec : chemical ] ) , while no chemical doping profile can be easily introduced in a completely top - gated cnfet .      in this section",
    "we present electrical characteristics of our dual - gate cnfets at various gate voltage ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) configurations .",
    "in particular , we utilize electrostatic doping effects in cnfets to eliminate ambipolar characteristics in an sb - cnfet and to obtain a bulk - switched transistor possessing a tunable polarity ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , steep subthreshold swing , excellent off - state performance , and suppressed @xmath7 dependence@xcite .",
    "this is achieved by a distinct @xmath23 or @xmath22 band profile in our dual - gate cnfet .",
    "figure[npbranch](a ) shows the subthreshold swing of a dual - gate cnfet at @xmath35v when the two gate voltages are equal ( @xmath36 ) . in this gate voltage configuration ,",
    "the device is essentially equivalent to a standard back - gated cnfet as shown in fig.[thinoxcnfet](a ) , and the switching behavior is mainly determined by the schottky barriers at the contacts , resulting in the expected ambipolar behavior . in fig.[npbranch](a ) , the off - current @xmath12 is below our instrument sensitivity level ( @xmath37a)@xcite . the dual - gate cnfet possesses drastically different subthreshold characteristics ( @xmath5 measured as a function of @xmath32 ) when the si gate voltage @xmath33 is kept constant . as shown in fig.[npbranch](b ) , the same dual - gate cnfet exhibits clear @xmath1 and @xmath0-type unipolar properties for @xmath38v ( @xmath39 ) and + 1.6v ( @xmath40 ) , respectively . in fig.[npbranch](b ) , positive ( + 0.6v ) and negative ( -0.6v ) drain voltages are used for @xmath0-type and @xmath1-type branches , respectively , in order to illustrate regular @xmath0 and @xmath1-fet device operations .",
    "this @xmath1-fet ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath0-fet ( @xmath42 ) behavior of the dual - gate cnfet can be understood by the schematic band diagrams shown in figs.[bands3](a ) and ( b ) , respectively . for a sufficiently negative ( or positive ) si gate voltage ,",
    "the schottky barriers are thinned enough to allow for hole ( or electron ) tunneling from the metal contacts into the nanotube channel , and regions a become electrostatically doped as @xmath1-type ( or @xmath0-type ) , resulting in a @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) band profile that allows only hole ( or electron ) transport in the nanotube channel . the dual - gate cnfet is switched on and off by varying the al gate voltage that alters the barrier height for carrier transport across region b. in this configuration , regions a serve as extended source and drain , and our device operates in a fashion similar to a conventional mosfet through bulk - switching in region b. we note that for si mosfets , transistors with electrically - induced source / drain regions have been fabricated by using additional side gates  @xcite , and our dual - gate structure is reminiscent of the straddle - gate si mosfets demonstrated by tiwari et al  @xcite .",
    "the results in fig.[npbranch](b ) are in drastic contrast to the ambipolar behavior of the same device shown in fig.[npbranch](a ) , proving the successful elimination of ambipolar characteristics and the first experimental demonstration of controlling the cnfet polarity by means of electrostatic effects .",
    "it is interesting to note the @xmath0-fet branch in fig.[npbranch](b ) exhibits a non - monotonic behavior with the current rising for @xmath43v , as indicated by the circle in fig.[npbranch](b ) .",
    "this feature is due to band - to - band tunneling that occurs when the two gate voltages are different enough such that the valence band in region b is higher than the conduction band in regions a ( or vice versa ) .",
    "further discussion of this band - to - band tunneling phenomenon is reported elsewhere@xcite .    in our dual - gate cnfets",
    ", the si back gate plays an important role in determining the type of majority carrier and the device on - current . in order to study",
    "the impact of the si gate voltage on the device performance , figure[variousvbg](a ) shows the subthreshold characteristics of a dual - gate cnfet for different si back gate voltages @xmath33 , with particular emphasis on the @xmath1-fet branches ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we first note that for @xmath45v , the on - current is relatively low because the current is limited by the carrier injection at the schottky barriers rather than the barrier in region b. for @xmath46v , in particular , @xmath5 is independent of @xmath32 and the device is essentially off for the entire @xmath32 range , indicating the schottky barrier at the contact prohibits carrier emission for this si gate voltage . as @xmath33 becomes more negative , the schottky barrier becomes thinner to facilitate hole injection , giving rise to a higher on - current . at sufficiently negative @xmath33 ( @xmath47v ) ,",
    "the device operates as an enhancement - mode @xmath1-fet with a negative threshold voltage and an inverse subthreshold slope @xmath26mv / dec .",
    "we note that this @xmath48 value is the smallest slope reported for cnfets to date , and is close to the theoretical minimum value of @xmath49mv / dec attainable for conventional mosfets at room temperature ( where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are the boltzmann constant , temperature , and electron charge , respectively ) . in comparison",
    ", the same device possesses @xmath53mv / dec when operated as an sb - cnfet with @xmath54 ( see fig.[variousvbg](b ) ) .",
    "the results indicate that in addition to the elimination of ambipolar characteristics , a steeper subthreshold swing can also be obtained in our devices due to bulk - switching enabled by the distinct dual - gate design .",
    "the nearly - ideal @xmath48 value ( 63mv / dec ) measured for our dual - gate cnfet suggests a gate efficiency close to 1 , which is made possible by the dual back gate design that allows exclusive al gate control in region b. we further note that in addition to the factors that affect the inverse subthreshold slope @xmath48 for conventional mosfets , the @xmath48 value of our dual - gate cnfets also depends on tunneling properties at the schottky barriers , as explained in the following .    in the vicinity of the schottky barriers in regions",
    "a , the carrier energy distribution @xmath55 is proportional to the product of @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the tunneling probability through the schottky barrier and @xmath58 is the fermi - dirac distribution in the metal at temperature @xmath51 . as carriers travel away from the contact , inelastic scattering processes such as electron - phonon interaction will thermalize the carrier distribution back to the equilibrium distribution characterized by the ambient temperature @xmath51 , which is the important parameter in deriving the theoretical value of @xmath59 .",
    "however , at low fields , the carrier mean - free - path in cnfets can be as long as half a micrometer and the transport is essentially ballistic over the entire region a ( @xmath27 nm ) . without an effective mechanism @xcite to relax the non - equilibrium carrier energy distribution , the carriers arriving at the barrier in region b possess the same distribution as @xmath55 , which can , in principle , deviate significantly from a well - tempered fermi - dirac distribution if the tunneling probability @xmath57 is highly energy - dependent . since tunneling through",
    "a schottky barrier always favors higher energy carriers , the effective temperature @xmath60 of the carrier distribution @xmath55 is higher than the lattice temperature @xmath51@xcite , causing a larger @xmath48 value than @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , from the aspect of device performance , a schottky barrier with @xmath62 constant ( @xmath63 ) is important not only for a high on - current , but also essential to obtain an inverse subthreshold slope close to 60mv / dec at room temperature .    we have also studied the @xmath7 dependence of our device performance , as shown in fig.[variousvds ] for the measured subthreshold characteristics of a dual - gate cnfet at different drain voltages . in fig.[variousvds ] , the si back gate @xmath33 is always kept at -4v , and the device exhibits @xmath1-fet characteristics . compared to the results in fig.[thinoxcnfet](b ) , the subthreshold swing of the dual - gate cnfet exhibits a much weaker dependence on the drain voltage @xmath7 .",
    "the dual - gate cnfet possesses a very low @xmath64fa , and @xmath12 is almost independent of @xmath7 .",
    "this dramatic improvement of off - state performance for dual - gate cnfets is not unexpected because the minority carrier injection from the drain electrode is effectively eliminated by the distinct @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) band profile in our design ( see fig.[bands3 ] ) .",
    "by using a novel dual - gate structure , we have successfully modified the switching mechanism of a cnfet from schottky barrier modulation to bulk - channel switching , resulting in a unipolar transistor with tunable polarity , excellent subthreshold slopes , and drastically improved off - state .      in the previous section ,",
    "we have demonstrated cnfets with improved performance due to a distinct @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) potential profile along the nanotube by means of electrostatic doping in selected areas ( i.e.  regions a ) . by varying the si back gate voltage ,",
    "the polarity of the dual - gate cnfet can be readily tuned .",
    "the role of the si back gate , in principle , can be replaced by introducing proper chemical dopants into regions a in order to achieve the same band bending profile .",
    "the use of chemical dopants in regions a is attractive because the device can be operated with the back gate grounded ( @xmath65 ) or ultimately without the presence of any back gate , which is essential for high frequency applications to minimize parasitic capacitances .",
    "controlled @xmath0-type chemical doping of nanotubes has been accomplished previously by using alkali metals or air - stable polymers to create @xmath0-type transistors@xcite and @xmath66 devices@xcite . however , in those devices , gating always occurs over the entire nanotube .",
    "based on the dual - gate cnfet design , next we discuss our results on chemical doping in conjunction with electrostatic doping . in particular , @xmath0-type chemical dopants are used here to obtain an @xmath23 doping profile along the nanotube .    in order to obtain a chemical doping profile along the tube , a resist layer consisting of hsq is patterned on top of the al gate area of a dual - gate cnfet .",
    "hsq ( hydrogen silsesquioxane ) is a negative resist for e - beam lithography , and is compatible with our chemical doping processes for nanotubes .",
    "figure[dblgate_hsq ] shows the sem image and the schematic cross - section of a dual - gate cnfet patterned with a layer of hsq resist .",
    "the hsq layer protects the nanotube segment ( region b in fig.[dblgate_hsq ] ) from being influenced by chemical dopants , so that a @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) chemical doping profile can be obtained with respect to regions a and b. in our design , the al gate and the hsq layer permit independent electrostatic and chemical doping profiles along the tube channel .",
    "after the hsq patterning , figure[p2n](a ) shows measured @xmath5 vs.@xmath32 of a dual - gate cnfet ( ti / pd contact ) at different @xmath33 prior to any chemical doping treatment@xcite .",
    "we note that this device operates as a @xmath1-fet even for @xmath67 , suggesting that this cnfet was unintentionally @xmath1-doped during the fabrication process@xcite .",
    "however , figure[p2n](a ) also points out an important fact which is that the nanotube segment in region b is not subject to this unintentional @xmath1-doping because the cnfet is still in the off state at @xmath68v .",
    "therefore , this cnfet possesses a @xmath22 doping profile due to the unintentional @xmath1-doping effect after the hsq patterning .",
    "the device is then dipped in an ethanol solution containing 25wt% of pei for 4 hours , followed by an ethanol rinse .",
    "here we use pei ( polyethylene imine ) , an @xmath0-type dopant for nanotubes@xcite , to demonstrate chemical doping effects in our devices .",
    "figure[p2n](b ) shows the measured subthreshold characteristics of the same cnfet after pei doping , exhibiting a drastically different behavior from that of the original device shown in fig.[p2n](a ) .",
    "the clear @xmath0-fet characteristics for @xmath69v shown in fig.[p2n](b ) indicate successful @xmath1-fet to @xmath0-fet conversion by doping regions a with pei .",
    "one important feature observed in figs.[p2n](a ) and ( b ) is that both @xmath1-fet and @xmath0-fet devices before and after pei doping operate as enhancement - mode transistors with threshold voltages @xmath70 of about -0.7v and + 0.4 v , respectively .",
    "this is due to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 chemical doping profile enabled by the hsq resist layer . without our distinct doping profile , the threshold voltage would shift with increasing doping level , resulting in a depletion - mode transistor at high doping levels@xcite .    the operation of the dual - gate cnfet with a chemical doping profile can be understood by the band structures depicted in fig.[doped_band3 ] .",
    "we note that since the area covered by hsq resist ( region b ) is narrower than the al gate ( region b ) , there exists an additional band bending within region b where both the al gate and the chemical dopants are effective .",
    "this additional step in the potential profile has little effect on the transistor performance because the switching behavior is mainly determined by the total barrier height rather than the detail structure of the barrier .",
    "band - to - band tunneling currents , on the other hand , may be substantially suppressed because of this step - like band structure in region b.",
    "last , we present simulation results for our dual - gate cnfets . in the simulation , we consider a cnfet consisting of a nanotube connected to two semi - infinite source / drain metallic contacts , forming schottky barriers . the dual - gate structure is explicitly taken into account by three gate segments between the contacts , and is characterized by lengths @xmath71 and @xmath72 for regions a and b , respectively .",
    "the charge in and the current through the cnfet is calculated self - consistently using the non - equilibrium green s function formalism together with a modified 1d possion equation .",
    "a quadratic dispersion relation is assumed in the conduction and valence band .",
    "further details regarding the simulation can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "figure[exp_sim ] shows both measured and simulated subthreshold characteristics of a dual - gate cnfet ( without chemical doping ) at different si back gate voltages@xcite . in the simulation",
    ", we assumed a nanotube energy gap @xmath73 of 1.0ev@xcite and a schottky barrier height @xmath74ev for holes . in fig.[exp_sim ] , the simulated current @xmath5 as a function of al gate voltages @xmath75 exhibits excellent agreement with measured data over a wide range of @xmath32 for various si back gate voltages .",
    "in particular , both experiment and simulation yield an inverse subthreshold slope @xmath48 close to 60mv / dec for sufficiently negative @xmath33 values , confirming the bulk - switching phenomena in our devices .",
    "it is noteworthy that as @xmath76 varies , the simulated curves @xmath77 also show good quantitative agreements with experimental data in terms of @xmath78 .",
    "the on - current decreases with increasing @xmath33 because the schottky barriers at the contact limit the maximum current through the device .",
    "the height of the schottky barrier is determined by the nanotube band gap and the work function of the contact metal .",
    "it is expected that by using nanotubes of larger diameters and choosing proper metals for contact electrodes ( e.g.  pd ) , the schottky barriers can be effectively lowered to achieve an on - current as high as 25@xmath79a  @xcite .",
    "the agreement between experiment and simulation results is encouraging because it not only marks the quality of the model used here , but also provides compelling evidence for the operation concept of dual - gate cnfets .",
    "since the regions a of our dual - gate cnfet resembles the extended source and drain in a conventional mosfet structure , the switching speed of the dual - gate cnfet is mainly determined by the active gate in region b. for high - frequency applications , this active gate length @xmath72 of region b determines the transit time for an electron / hole travelling from source to drain .",
    "therefore , although the entire length between the metal source / drain contacts is @xmath80 , it is @xmath72 , rather than @xmath81 , that is the critical parameter in terms of lateral scaling to improve performance . in order to minimize parasitic capacitances for high - frequency applications",
    ", we have also demonstrated that the si back gate in regions a can be replaced by using chemical dopants , although future studies are needed to quantify the correlation between the doping level and the obtained fermi level shift .",
    "in conclusion , we have fabricated cnfets with a novel dual - gate structure in order to achieve a distinct @xmath22 or @xmath23 doping profile along the nanotube .",
    "the @xmath22 or @xmath23 doping scheme , obtained by electrostatic and/or chemical doping effects , eliminates the ambipolar characteristics and , for the first time , creates pure @xmath1 or @xmath0-type enhancement - mode cnfets with a controllable polarity for thin gate oxides .",
    "compared to previous sb - cnfets where the schottky barriers dominate the switching behavior , these dual - gate cnfets are bulk - switched devices , showing the steepest subthreshold slope reported to date .",
    "the good agreement between experiment and simulation further corroborates the novel device operation concept of the dual - gate structure .",
