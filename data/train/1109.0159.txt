    "in this section , i summarize the basic features of entangled states and reduced density matrices and illustrate them with examples . for further details , see e.g. the short review @xcite .",
    "entanglement is a notion which goes back to 1935 when it was introduced by schrdinger in a series of three articles ( in german , the german word is `` verschrnkung '' ) @xcite . at the same time",
    "einstein , podolski and rosen discussed their famous `` gedankenexperiment '' , in which they considered two particles with fixed total momentum and relative distance .",
    "nowadays this is usually formulated with two spins , and this is also where one encounters entanglement first .",
    "entanglement has to do with the features of quantum states and the information contained in wave functions . for a long time",
    ", it was a topic discussed mostly in quantum optics and for systems with few degrees of freedom .    in the last 25 years ,",
    "however , it has seen a revival with input from very different areas , namely    * the theory of black holes * the numerical investigation of quantum chains * the field of quantum information    in these cases one always deals with large systems and many degrees of freedom .    in entanglement investigations ,",
    "one asks the following _ question _ :    * given a total system in a certain quantum state @xmath0 * divide it ( in space , or in hilbert space ) in two parts ( bipartition ) * how are the two parts coupled in @xmath0 ?",
    "this is more general than looking at , say , a two - point correlation function .",
    "and there is a general way to answer this question , namely one can bring @xmath0 into a standard form , which displays the coupling .",
    "this is the _",
    "schmidt decomposition _ which we will discuss in a moment . to obtain it in practice",
    ", one uses quantities which determine all properties of a subsystem , namely _ reduced density matrices _ ( rdm s ) .",
    "they also contain the information on the entanglement and will be the basic _ tool _ throughout the lectures .",
    "the _ states _ we will study are the ground states of models which , on the one hand , are solvable and , on the other hand , have a physical significance , like tight - binding ( hopping ) models or spin chains . as in other contexts , they serve as points of orientation which allow to study the features of the problem and to develop a feeling and an overall picture .",
    "my own interest arose in connection with the dmrg , where the entanglement turned out to be crucial for the performance of the method .",
    "entanglement continues to play a role also in other algorithms and their design , and in this respect it has quite practical implications .",
    "but in these lectures , we shall be concerned essentially with the theory .",
    "consider a quantum system in state @xmath0 and divide it into two parts 1 and 2",
    ". then one can write @xmath1 where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are orthonormal bases in the two hilbert spaces .",
    "+ note that one has a double sum and that the matrix @xmath4 is in general rectangular , since the dimensions of the hilbert spaces can differ .",
    "nevertheless one can obtain a diagonal form via the so - called singular - value decomposition @xmath5 where @xmath6 is square and unitary , @xmath7 diagonal and @xmath8 rectangular with orthonormal rows .",
    "this gives @xmath9 combining @xmath2 with @xmath6 and @xmath10 with @xmath8 one obtains with @xmath11 @xmath12 this is called the schmidt decomposition ( schmidt 1907 ) @xcite . for the history see section 1.7 .",
    "it has the following features    * single sum , limited by the smaller hilbert space * new orthonormal sets @xmath13 in both parts * @xmath14 if @xmath0 is normalized * entanglement encoded in the @xmath15 * limiting cases + @xmath16 for @xmath17 : only one term , product state , no entanglement + @xmath18 for all @xmath19 : all terms equal weight , maximal entanglement    this refers to a particular bipartition and one can investigate different partitions to obtain a complete picture .",
    "some standard bipartitions for one - dimensional systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometries ] .",
    "we give here examples for the schmidt decomposition in three different systems .",

    "as to the entanglement , assume that @xmath0 has the schmidt form ( [ schmidt ] ) .",

    "this form will be encountered permanently in the following . * the @xmath66 should not be confused with e.g. the one - particle density matrices , which are simple correlation functions .",
    "usually , one starts in a basis where @xmath0 has the form ( [ state ] )",
    ". then @xmath72 and taking the trace with the @xmath3 gives @xmath61 and @xmath73 thus @xmath74 contains the square hermitian matrix @xmath75 and similarly @xmath76 contains @xmath77 .",

    "the matrix @xmath80 is then @xmath81 and one obtains @xmath82 since the trace is one , the eigenvalues are given by @xmath83 the state is entangled if @xmath84 , i.e. if @xmath85 .",
    "this includes the state @xmath86 in section 1.3 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the density - matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) is a numerical procedure , which was introduced by steven white in 1992 @xcite and makes direct use of the schmidt decomposition and the reduced density matrices . for a review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum chain , e.g. a spin one - half model , with open ends .",
    "then in the simplest variant , the following steps take place , compare fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg ] .",
    "\\(0 ) start + begin with a small system of 5 - 10 sites .",
    "+ calculate the ground state _ exactly_. + ( 1 ) schmidt decomposition + divide into two halves .",

    "+ truncation error : sum of the discarded weights @xmath91 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) enlargement + insert ( two ) additional sites in the center .",
    "+ form new hamiltonian in the basis of kept and additional states .",
    "+ calculate ground state .",
    "+ go back to ( 1 ) and repeat .",
    "+        for this procedure , the form of the schmidt spectra is crucial . to have a good performance ,",
    "a rapid drop of the @xmath90 is necessary such that only a small number of schmidt states has to be kept . in terms of entanglement",
    ", the state must be _",
    "weakly entangled_. this is satisfied for non - critical chains . for an ising model in a transverse field , such a small number as 16 schmidt states gives already a fantastic accuracy for the ground - state energy .",
    "it is therefore important to understand the features of rdm spectra and this leads directly to the study of solvable cases , which is the topic of these lectures .",
    "the full rdm spectra give the clearest impression of the entanglement in a bipartite system .",
    "but it is also desirable to have a simple measure through one number .",
    "since the eigenvalues of the rdm s can be viewed as probabilities , one can take the usual entropy , as used in probability theory , to characterize the @xmath90 .",
    "this gives the ( von neumannn ) entanglement entropy @xmath92 which is the common entanglement measure for bipartitions .",
    "it has the following properties    * @xmath93 since the spectra are equal .",
    "one can talk of _ the _ entanglement entropy .",

    "a related measure is the rnyi entropy @xmath100 where @xmath19 can also be non - integer .",

    "expand the exponential function to obtain @xmath105 .",
    "the rnyi entropy is somewhat simpler to calculate , since it contains only a power of @xmath66 .",
    "the important point is that both entropies measure a _ mutual connection _ and will , in general , _ not _ be proportional to the size of a subsystem as usual thermodynamic entropies are .",
    "erhard schmidt ( 1876 - 1959 ) obtained his phd in 1905 with hilbert in gttingen and was professor at the berlin university 1917 - 1950 .",
    "he is most widely known by the orthogonalization procedure bearing his name .",
    "the work linking him to the quantum problems discussed here , appeared in 1907 in the prestigeous journal `` mathematische annalen '' @xcite .",
    "it was based on his thesis and dealt with coupled integral equations with a non - symmetric kernel @xmath106 .    in abstract notation , and changing his parameter @xmath107 to @xmath108 , the equations were @xmath109 he deduced a spectral representation for @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the eigenfunctions of the symmetric kernels @xmath114 and @xmath115 with common eigenvalue @xmath116 @xmath117 one sees that the kernel @xmath106 corresponds to the total wave function , which for two degrees of freedom is @xmath118 .",
    "moreover , one sees that he already worked with the quantities which in the present context are called reduced density matrices . and finally , he discussed best approximations for the kernel based on keeping the terms with largest weights , which is the same recipe as used in the dmrg .",
    "the representation of a wave function @xmath118 in this way was discussed in a paper by schrdinger in 1935 @xcite . at that time",
    ", unsymmetric kernels were already well - known in mathematics , so he referred not to schmidt but to the textbook by courant and hilbert .",
    "the specialists will notice that the equations ( [ hist1 ] ) , ( [ hist3 ] ) with @xmath119 and @xmath120 are just the ones appearing in the famous paper by lieb , schultz and mattis ( 1961 ) @xcite where they diagonalize a quadratic form in fermions .",
    "before we start the discussion of the free - particle models , which will be the focus of these lectures , let me list the quantum states for which one can obtain explicit results for bipartite rdm s and thus for the entanglement    * ground states of free - fermion or free - boson systems * ground states of certain integrable models * ground states of conformally invariant models * ground states which have matrix - product form or other simple structures    an example of the last case was the ferromagnetic ground state in section 1.3 .",
    "consider models where the hamiltonian is a quadratic form in fermionic or bosonic operators and defined on a lattice .",
    "two standard examples are    * fermionic hopping models with conserved particle number @xmath121 * coupled oscillators with eigenfrequency @xmath122 @xmath123 + \\frac { 1}{4 } \\sum_{m , n } k_{m , n } ( x_m- x_n)^2 \\label{oscillators}\\ ] ]    for such free - particle models , the reduced density matrices for the ground state can be written @xmath124 here @xmath125 is the number of sites in subsystem @xmath67 and the operators @xmath126 , @xmath127 are fermionic or bosonic creation and annihilation operators for single - particle states with eigenvalues @xmath128 . the @xmath129 s",

    "nevertheless , the entanglement problem has been reduced to that of a certain hamiltonian and its thermodynamic properties .",

    "this amounts to another stretching of the coordinate @xmath152 .",
    "* result    @xmath153    this is the form announced above .",

    "however , one sees that the calculation involves a number of steps and is already somewhat tedious for the simple case treated above .",
    "it is therefore fortunate that another much simpler approach exists which we will discuss for fermions @xcite .",

    "in such a state , all many - particle correlation functions factorize into products of one - particle functions . for example , @xmath156 if all sites are in the same subsystem , a calculation using the reduced density matrix must give the same result .",

    "moreover , i return once more to possible relations between the entanglement hamiltonian and the real one and finally give a short summary .      if a quantum state changes in time , this will in general affect the entanglement properties . however , the change must be more than a mere phase factor .",

    "the curve for slow switching rises on average _",
    "linearly_. the interpretation is that here the disconnected system has enough time to `` recover '' and thereby the entanglement gain repeats itself after each new connection .",
    "the problem can be treated analytically in a continuum model @xcite .    in general",
    ", one can express @xmath27 in terms of the ( time - dependent ) cumulants of the probability distribution @xmath453 to transfer @xmath19 particles .",
