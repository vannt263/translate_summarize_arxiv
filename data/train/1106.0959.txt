    "the following procedure has been used .",
    "one transmission peak of the fpc1 cavity is tuned to coincide with the doppler - free absorption resonance on the 5@xmath75 transition obtained in the auxiliary cell , and then the laser frequency is locked to the next transmission fpc1 peak , which is red - detuned on a free spectral range of the cavity .",

    "the signal - to - noise ratio is estimated using an averaged amplitude of the fluorescence signal normalized on the rms voltage observed for off - resonant laser frequencies .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] demonstrates the derived atomic density dependence of the detected fluorescence when intensities of the 780 nm and 776 nm beams in the center of the cell are equal approximately 180 mw/@xmath67 and 300 mw/@xmath67 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the fluorescence signal grows steadily with atomic density .",
    "linear fit to experimental data presented in double - logarithmic scale reveals that the directly observed fluorescence signal is practically proportional to atomic density , while the lock - in processed signal grows slightly faster .",
    "the amplitude and frequency noise of laser light and frequency noise of the detection system limit the detection capability of the method .",
    "signal averaging can increase the signal - to - noise ratio ; however , a number of averaging is limited by frequency stability of the both lasers .",
    "taking into account the fwhm of fluorescence resonances ( @xmath786 mhz ) and the typical drift of the fp cavity reference resonance due to temperature and pressure instability ( 0.4 mhz / sec ) , we can conclude that averaging the signal over 32 periods of 50 hz scans of the 776 nm laser is tolerable because during this time interval ( 0.64 sec ) the drift of the 780 nm laser stabilized over the fp cavity is less than 5% of the fwhm of the fluorescence resonance .",
    "thus , averaging results in more than 10-fold reduction of the noise uncorrelated with laser scanning and at the same time does not significantly distort the width of recorded spectra .    in order to be in linear regime of the pmt for the whole range of atomic densities ,",
    "blue fluorescence is recorded at the lowest available pmt voltage .",
    "higher pmt voltage within certain limits can also improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "at least 200-fold increase of the signal under the same noise level can be obtained in our experimental conditions . altogether with averaging the signal",
    "this could allow us to detect atomic density lower than @xmath79  @xmath32 .",
    "an estimation for the volume of the interaction zone , which in our case is 0.35 @xmath32 , leads to a conclusion that a detection threshold is approximately @xmath80 atoms .",
    "an improvement of the detection capability can be accessed by applying an amplitude modulation and a lock - in amplification .",
    "our estimations based on measured spectra of the amplitude noise of fluorescence signals show that signal - to - noise ratio can be increased by a factor of 750 and 2000 for the integration time of 100 ms and the modulation frequency of 700 hz and 10 khz , respectively .",
    "ultimately the detection threshold is reduced to approximately 1000 rb atoms in the interaction volume .",
    "this result can be further improved primarily by better collection of emitted blue fluorescence ( in our case the collection efficiency is approximately 1.8% ) and longer , up to minutes , signal averaging accessible by better laser stability .",
    "optical pumping through the @xmath81 line could increase a number of atoms on a resonant sublevel and therefore increase the fluorescence signal intensity .",
    "as doppler - free fluorescence resonances occur when the sum frequency of the two lasers ( @xmath21 + @xmath22 ) is equal to frequencies of the @xmath11 transitions , they can be used as a reference for sum frequency stabilization using a single servo system .",
    "the similar idea has been implemented with two independent lasers locked to a narrow cpt - type absorption resonance ( @xmath82-resonance ) , which is also has the two - photon origin , however , in that case the locking results in differential frequency stabilization @xcite .",
    "the sum - frequency locking of two lasers can be implemented using a standard locking technique based on the frequency modulation and the lock - in amplification and one of the sub - doppler fluorescence resonances shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "it makes no difference whether the feedback applied to the 780 nm or 776 nm lasers and which laser is modulated .",
    "the sum frequency ( @xmath21 + @xmath22 ) can be stabilized even if one laser is free running .",
    "once the lock is engaged the servo system compensates random frequency excursions of the free - running laser by changing correspondingly the frequency of the stabilized laser to keep the sum frequency fixed .    to demonstrate the direct sum frequency stabilization using one servo system ,",
    "the 780 nm laser is approximately 600 mhz blue detuned from the @xmath83 transition in @xmath29rb , while frequency of the 776 nm laser is tuned in a such way that an excitation of @xmath29rb atoms to the @xmath84 level occurs .    using a pid servo system which provides only slow feedback ( from dc to  1  khz ) to the piezo - electric transducer that controls the 780 nm laser cavity , the sum frequency instability estimated from the error signal approximately equals to 240 khz .",
    "this value corresponds to the relative instability @xmath85 + @xmath86 of @xmath87 .",
    "the sum frequency instability can be essentially reduced by a proper optimization of the reference line and by locking of the free - running laser to a tunable fp cavity .",
    "the suggested and demonstrated sum frequency stabilization could be useful for rydberg atoms excitation experiments @xcite and in intervening spectral regions devoid of strong atomic transitions . as the blue fluorescence signal depends on frequency detuning ,",
    "this can then be used to derive an absolute frequency of the 780  nm laser in the vicinity of the rb @xmath24 line .",
    "it is envisaged that this could form a basis for an additional level locking scheme based on the amplitude of the fluorescence resonance .",
