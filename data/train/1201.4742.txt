    "recent observational data indicate that our universe is currently in accelerated phase @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of the acceleration , a large number of possible mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of the dark energy .",
    "general relativity in its standard form can not explain the accelerated expansion without extra terms or components , which have been gathered under the name of dark energy .",
    "there are various proposals to construct an acceptable dark energy model , such as : a scalar field with quintessence - like or phantom - like behavior @xcite , spinor , ( non-)abelian vector theory , cosmological constant , fluid with a complicated equation of state , and higher dimensions @xcite . as a result",
    ", we have a number of competing scenarios which to describe late - time acceleration . working in framework of one of the above proposals ,",
    "we are forced to introduce the following extra cosmological components : inflaton , a dark component and dark matter .",
    "we concentrate on the modified gravity @xcite , which represents a classical generalization of general relativity ( modifications of the hilbert - einstein action by introducing different functions of the ricci scalar @xcite or gauss - bonnet invariant @xcite ) , should consistently describe the early - time inflation and late - time acceleration , without the introduction of any other dark component .    in the present work",
    "we will focus on the gauss - bonnet gravity , where the gravitational action includes functions of the gauss - bonnet invariant @xmath0 it is interesting , that the theory of this type is closely related to higher order string curvature corrections @xcite .",
    "the starting action is @xmath1\\ .\\ ] ]    here @xmath2 is the gauss - bonnet invariant ( [ i2 ] ) and the scalar field @xmath3 is canonical in ( [ gbany1 ] ) .",

    "one may rewrite the action ( [ nlgb1 ] ) in a local form : @xmath16 in fact , from the @xmath3-equation we find @xmath17 . by substituting this expression into ( [ nlgb3 ] )",
    ", we reobtain ( [ nlgb1 ] ) .    thus , by studying @xmath12 - gravity",
    ", we are also exploring several other models .",
    "note that in some cases , @xmath12 or even @xmath18 ) gravity maybe transformed to @xmath19 gravity @xcite .",
    "the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite give the bounds to the value of the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath20 , which is the ratio of the pressure of the dark energy to the energy density of it , in the range of -1.11 < @xmath20 < -0.86 .",
    "this could be consistent if the dark energy is a cosmological constant with @xmath20 = -1 and therefore our universe seems to approach asymptotically de sitter universe .    although the accelerating expansions seem to be de sitter type , the possibility that the current acceleration could be quintessence type , in which @xmath20 > -1 , or phantom type , in which @xmath20 < -1 , is not completely excluded .",
    "it is often assumed that the early universe started from the singular point often called big bang . however , if the current ( or future ) universe enters the quintessence / phantom stage , it may evolve to the finite - time future singularity depending on the specific model under consideration and the value of the effective eos parameter ( big rip ) @xcite .",
    "an elegant solution to this problem has been recently proposed @xcite under the form of the so - called little rip cosmology which appears to be a realistic alternative to the @xmath21cdm model .",

    "in this paper we construct a series of cosmological models which describe the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the models in framework of the modified gauss - bonnet gravity are constructed by the reconstruction method .",
    "constructed models are of the effective phantom type and do not lead to a singularity in the future ( little rip models ) .",
    "an explicit form of the action leading to such a model within the framework of gravity @xmath55 and @xmath142 is obtained .",
    "the solution contains special function , which can be removed by choosing the constant of integration .",
    "the resulting action consists of three terms , each of which plays a role at the definite stage of the evolution of the universe . since the last term represents the difference between the functions of the same order , and this order of these functions is maximal , it has double the lead - with the average values and tends to infinity .",
    "in addition we construct a model describing the little rip in the multivariate gauss - bonnet theory with dilaton , when visible , and additional spaces are maximally symmetric .",
    "little rip models provide an evolution for the universe intermediate between asymptotic de sitter expansion and models with a big rip singularity .",
    "therefore , the method of reconstruction models were built describing the de sitter space and space with the metric [ big_rip1 ] , which refers to the phantom type and has a singularity of the future .",
    "for all constructed models @xmath143 ( except destter model ) and therefore they belong to the phantom type . for models of the effective phantom energy conditions are always broken .",
    "such behavior is typical for the little rip models @xcite      we can continue to explore these theories and consider stability of solutions",
    ". however , as shown by work @xcite little rip solutions are stable and can be expected and received from our paper solutions will have the same property .",
