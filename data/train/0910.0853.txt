    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) has long been proposed to play a vital role in galaxy evolution in clusters , through ram pressure and turbulent / viscous stripping of the galactic cold gas ( e.g. , gunn & gott 1972 ; nulsen 1982 ; quilis et al . 2000 ) .",
    "as the halo gas and the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) is depleted in the stripping process , the galactic star formation will eventually be shut down and blue disk galaxies may turn into red galaxies ( e.g. , quilis et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the removal of the cold ism also affects the accretion history of the central smbh .",
    "stripping of the ism of the disk galaxies in clusters has been extensively studied in simulations recently , with better resolution and more physics included ( e.g. , abadi et al .",
    "1999 ; stevens et al . 1999 ; quilis et al . 2000 ; schulz & struck 2001 ; bekki & couch 2003 ; roediger & hensler 2005 ; kapferer et al .",
    "these simulations show that stripping has a significant impact on galaxy evolution ( e.g. , disk truncation , formation of flocculent arms , build - up of a central bulge and enhanced star formation in the inner disk at the early stage of the interaction ) .    besides the impact on galaxy evolution , another significant question related to stripping is the evolution of the stripped ism .",
    "after the cold ism is removed from the galaxy , the general wisdom is that the stripped gas is mixed with the icm through evaporation eventually .",
    "however , it is now known that a fraction of the stripped ism turns into new stars in the galactic halo or the intracluster space , as revealed from observations ( e.g. , sun et al .",
    "2007b , s07 hereafter ) and simulations ( e.g. , vollmer et al .",
    "2001b ; schulz & struck 2001 ; kronberger et al . 2008 ; kapferer et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the stripped cold ism , if it can survive long enough to reach the cluster center , can effectively heat the cluster core via ram - pressure drag , which makes gravitational heating by accretion a possible way to offset cooling ( dekel & birnboim 2008 argued for 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 clumps ) .",
    "current hi observations of cluster spiral galaxies still fail to detect most of the hi gas missing from hi - deficient spiral galaxies in the intracluster space ( e.g. , vollmer & huchtmeier 2007 ) , which implies that the bulk of the stripped hi gas has been heated out of the cold phase .",
    "however , little is known about the details of mixing , as the actual strength of heat conductivity and viscosity is poorly known . how quickly is the stripped cold ism heated and mixed with the icm ? what observational signature will evaporation and mixing produce ?",
    "what fraction of the stripped cold ism turns into new stars ?",
    "the mixing of the stripped cold ism with the hot icm will produce multi - phase gas .",
    "depending on the poorly known details of mixing , prominent soft x - ray emission may be produced , as well as h@xmath4 emission . in this `` unified model '' for tails of cluster",
    "late - type galaxies , x - ray and h@xmath4 tails are simply manifestations of the cold ism tail in the mixing process .",
    "therefore , one can better understand mixing and the relevant micro - physics from multi - wavelength data , e.g. , the amount of missing hi gas and the amount of the stripped gas in hotter phases .",
    "obviously , a central problem is the energy transfer in the multi - phase gas , which is also a significant question for large cool cores in clusters .",
    "moreover , the wake behind the galaxy produced by stripping provides a way to constrain the icm viscosity ( e.g. , sun et al .",
    "2006 , s06 hereafter ; roediger & br@xmath8ggen 2008a ) .",
    "various dynamic features , e.g. , bow shocks , tails and vortices , can be produced in stripping ( e.g. , stevens et al .",
    "1999 ; schulz & struck 2001 ; roediger et al . 2006 ; roediger & br@xmath8ggen 2008b , rb08 hereafter ; tonnesen & bryan 2009 ) .",
    "observational evidence of stripping of cluster late - type galaxies is present in hi and h@xmath4 observations , either through hi deficiency or tails ( e.g. , giovanelli & haynes 1985 ; gavazzi et al .",
    "2001b ; kenney et al .",
    "2004 ; oosterloo & van gorkom 2005 ; chung et al . 2007 ; yagi et al . 2007 ; s07 ) .",
    "x - ray tails of late - type cluster galaxies have only been detected recently : c153 in a2125 at @xmath9=0.253 ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ) , and ugc  6697 in a1367 at @xmath9=0.022 ( sun & vikhlinin 2005 ) . however , there are only @xmath0 60 counts from c153 so the x - ray extension is not unambiguous ( wang et al .",
    "the  data show that the x - ray tail of ugc  6697 may extend to @xmath0 90 kpc from the nucleus but most of the x - ray emission is within the galaxy .",
    "moreover , the galaxy has a peculiar morphology and a tidal tail .",
    "its complex kinematic behavior , revealed from the velocity map , implies the existence of a second galaxy hidden behind the main galaxy ( gavazzi et al .",
    "thus , ugc  6697 is a very complicated system where tidal interaction is important .",
    "there is also a wide tail ( 67 kpc@xmath1090 kpc ) of the spiral ngc  6872 in the 0.5 kev pavo group ( machacek et al .",
    "2005 ) , but it is uncertain how it was formed as the tail terminates on the dominant early - type galaxy of the group . the brightest known x - ray tail behind a cluster late - type galaxy is  in the closest rich cluster a3627 ( s06 ) , with @xmath0 80% of the x - ray emission beyond the galactic halo .",
    "one should be aware that strong x - ray tails of late - type galaxies are rare ( e.g. , none in virgo , see section 7.1 ) .",
    "we have done a blind search of strong x - ray tails in nearby clusters ( @xmath11 ) by extending our previous  work ( sun et al .",
    "2007a ) to the current  and  archives .",
    "despite extensive cluster data in the archives , e.g. , mosaic fields of @xmath0 2 deg@xmath12 around the perseus and coma clusters with , only two more x - ray tails of cluster late - type galaxies were found .",
    "one is also in a3627 ( ) and will be discussed in this paper .",
    "the other one is ngc  4848 in the coma cluster ( finoguenov et al .",
    "2004 ) that was recently observed for 29 ks by",
    ". however , both x - ray tails are shorter ( 40 - 50 kpc ) and 2.4 - 5.5 times fainter than s tail .",
    "thus , the proximity of , the high flux and the large length of its x - ray tail makes it the best target for detailed analysis and comparison with simulations .",
    "one should not confuse x - ray tails of early - type galaxies with those of late - type galaxies .",
    "early - type galaxies in clusters have abundant x - ray ism but little or no cold ism .",
    "there are some x - ray tails of early - type galaxies reported ( e.g. , machacek et al .",
    "2006 ; sun et al . 2007 ; randall et al . 2009 ) .",
    "their x - ray tails are composed of the stripped hot ism and do not co - exist with cold gas .",
    "a3627 is the closest massive cluster ( @xmath9=0.0163 , @xmath13 = 925 km / s and @xmath14=6 kev ) rivaling coma and perseus in mass and galaxy content ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1996 ; woudt et al . 2008 ) .",

    "2004 ) is close to the average velocity in a3627 ( 4871@xmath1654 km  s@xmath3 , woudt et al .",
    "2008 ) so most of its motion is probably in the plane of sky .",
    "if  is on a radial orbit , its real distance to the cluster center should be close to the projected distance .",
    "there is no sign of a galaxy merger and no strong tidal features around .",
    "s06 found a long x - ray tail behind , in both  ( 14 ks ) and  data ( mos : 18 ks , pn : 12 ks ) .",
    "the tail extends to at least 70 kpc from the galaxy with a length - to - width ratio of @xmath0 10 .",

    "no flares of particle background were found .",
    "there are also no flares in the light curve of the i2+i3 chips .",

    "in the spectral analysis , a lower energy cutoff of 0.4 kev ( for the bi data ) and 0.5 kev ( for the fi data ) is used to minimize the effects of calibration uncertainties at low energy .",

    "we obtained optical spectra of the emission - line objects identified by s07 with gmos on the  south ( program i d : 2008a - q50 ) . because the field is crowded with interesting sources , three masks had to be used with some sources covered in more than one mask .",
    "observations with the first mask were done on may 3 , 2008 ( airmass : 1.18 - 1.22 , seeing : @xmath34 ) . two exposures ( 20 minutes each ) were taken , with a central wavelength difference of 60   in order to cover the inter - chip gaps .",

    "we used 1@xmath29 slits for all sources .",
    "as queued observations , we used the calibration data of ltt4364 taken on the photometric night of may 27 , 2008 for the relative flux calibration .",
    "the gmos data were reduced with the gemini iraf package ( version 1.9.1 ) .",
    "we generally followed the standard procedures .",
    "besides the accompanying cuar arc data , we also used the night sky lines for the wavelength calibration .",
    "the latter procedure is the key to derive consistent velocities for the same source from different exposures . in this paper",
    ", we present only the velocity information and briefly discuss the nature of these sources ( hii regions ) .",
    "the detailed properties of these hii regions will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "the 0.6 - 2.0 kev  count image is shown in figure 1 , with point sources removed .",
    "the image was smoothed to enhance extended low surface brightness features . compared with images from short  and exposures ,",
    "a secondary tail is clearly visible to the south of the main tail .",
    "some substructures are also revealed , including a `` protrusion '' from the main tail and two sharp bends in the main tail . also in figure 1 , the x - ray contours from the adaptively smoothed image ( exposure corrected , not the one in the left panel ) are overlaid on the h@xmath4+continuum image from the southern observatory for astrophysical research ( soar ) .",
    "we also show the  image of the cluster and a composite color image of s tails ( figure 2 ) . in the following sections , we discuss the spatial and spectral properties of s tails .",
    "the observed soft x - ray emission of the tails most likely comes from the interfaces between the hot icm and the cold stripped ism .",
    "although there are no data for the cold atomic and molecular gas ( note the data on the pah emission and the warm molecular h@xmath20 , sivanandam et al .",
    "2010 ) , the x - ray surface brightness of the tails reveals a great deal about the stripped ism .",
    "the surface brightness of the tails is quantitatively examined .",
    "we first derived the 0.6 - 2 kev surface brightness profiles across some parts of the tails and the leading edge .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , both tails are narrow but highly significant features above the local background .",
    "even the `` protrusion '' is a 4.1 @xmath31 feature .",
    "the leading edge ( or the contact discontinuity ) is very sharp , corresponding to the h@xmath4 edge ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the gap between two tails has a similar surface brightness as the local background ( fig . 3b and 3c ) .",
    "for the front part of the gap , the surface brightness is ( 6.26@xmath160.30)@xmath37 cnts s@xmath3 kpc@xmath38 , while the local background is ( 5.88@xmath160.27)@xmath37 cnts s@xmath3 kpc@xmath38 .",
    "the low surface brightness of the gap has implications for the 3d structure of the stripped ism tail .",
    "one possibility for the observed double tails is the projection effect of one broad cold ism tail . according to this interpretation",
    ", the 3d structure of the soft x - ray emission might be a cylindrical shell that produces double tails in the projected surface brightness .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , such a configuration fails to simultaneously account for both the low surface brightness of the gap and the observed widths of two tails .",
    "the observed emission level between tails is similar to that outside tails . basically , the width of the cylindrical shell required to make the central emission dim also makes each peak unacceptably narrow in relation to the observed profiles .",
    "thus , the two x - ray tails are most likely detached .",
    "this is also supported by the  data ( sivanandam et al .",
    "the 8 @xmath22 m pah emission only appears in the first 20 kpc of the main tail .",
    "the irs data only cover a small field downstream but no enhanced warm h@xmath20 emission is present at the front part of the gap . eventually we need hi and co data to better reveal the distribution of the cold ism downstream of .    in principle , the surface brightness profiles along the tails reflect the stripping history . as shown in figure 5",
    ", both tails have wiggles and substructures along the ( time ) axis .",
    "however , the unknown conversion from the x - ray emission to the mass of the stripped ism ( filling factor , detail of the emission spectra , etc . ) makes this difficult with only the x - ray data .",
    "a more complete picture can be obtained with the hi and co data . from figure 5 , the total linear length of the whole tail system is at least 4.2@xmath39 or 80 kpc .",
    "we also measured the widths of the main tail in four segments ( before sharp bends ) and the widths of the secondary tail in two segments .",
    "the model is composed of a gaussian and a flat local background .",
    "as shown in figure 6 , the widths of both tails do not increase with the distance from the galaxy .",
    "this conflicts with simulations ( e.g. , rb08 ; kapferer et al .",
    "2009 ) , as further discussed in section 7.2 .",
    "if  is moving supersonically , a bow shock may form .",
    "the local sound speed is 1263 ( @xmath14 / 6 kev)@xmath40 km / s . for a mach number of 1.1 - 3 ,",
    "the predicted position of the bow shock is 20@xmath41 from the leading edge ( or the contact discontinuity ) .",
    "no such shock front is detected in the  exposure",
    ". the enhanced surface brightness would be much weaker in projection on the sky , especially if  is farther from the cluster center than the projected position .      with this deep  exposure , for the first time",
    "spatially - resolved spectroscopy can be done for x - ray stripping tails of a cluster late - type galaxy .",
    "we measured gas temperatures in five regions of the main tail and two regions of the secondary tail ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the background is from the local source - free regions .",
    "a single apec model with galactic absorption was used .",
    "we emphasize that the measured temperatures are only spectroscopic temperatures as the intrinsically multi - phase gas is fitted with a single-@xmath14 model .",
    "in fact , a hard x - ray excess generally exists in the spectral fits , which implies the existence of hotter components . however with limited statistics , we elected to keep the spectral model simple . as shown in figure 7 , the variations of spectroscopic temperatures along both tails are small .",
    "in fact , both tails have consistent temperatures .",
    "since temperatures derived from individual regions are similar , the total spectrum of two tails ( still excluding the `` head '' region ) was also examined with several models ( figure 8 and table 1 ) .",
    "this observation collects 3444 net counts from the thermal gas of the two tails in the 0.5 - 3 kev band .",
    "while the fit with a single-@xmath14 model is acceptable , the addition of a second component ( either another thermal component or a power - law component ) produces better fits .",
    "we also tried the xspec model cemekl , which allows a power - law distribution of the emission measure for multi-@xmath14 gas .",
    "we consider the spectral results shown in table 1 as evidence for multi - phase gas , especially as the single-@xmath14 model produces a very low abundance . adding another or more thermal components can increase the abundance to the solar value .",
    "nevertheless , the double apec or the cemekl models are no more than a phenomenological way to describe the data .",
    "it is still unclear what emergent spectrum mixing will produce .",
    "there are more complications , like the non - equilibrium ionization effect and the intrinsic absorption .",
    "generally , ionization equilibrium requires the collisional ionization parameter @xmath42 @xmath43 s. for @xmath44 @xmath43 , @xmath45 3 - 32 myr , which is comparable to the age of the x - ray tails .",
    "the x - ray gas mass of the tails can be estimated .",
    "the main uncertainties are the geometry ( or the filling factor ) of the x - ray emitting gas and the abundance of the gas .",
    "the filling factor of the soft x - ray emitting gas depends on the mass and configuration of the stripped cold ism gas in the tails .",
    "the soft x - rays may originate from the interfaces between the ambient hot icm and the stripped cold ism .",
    "a fragmented cold ism tail has larger surface area so the filling factor of the soft x - ray emitting gas would be larger .",
    "both uncertainties can be constrained by the assumed pressure equilibrium with the ambient icm . in the following ,",
    "we present the estimates from the one-@xmath14 fit , the two-@xmath14 fit and the cemekl fit .",
    "we assume both the main tail and the secondary tail are cylinders with a length of 80 kpc and radii of 3.9 kpc and 3.4 kpc respectively .",
    "the `` head '' and `` protrusion '' regions are not included . with the result from the one-@xmath14 fit ( the first row of table 1 ) ,",
    "the total x - ray gas mass is 2.0@xmath46 @xmath47 m@xmath7 , where @xmath48 is the filling factor of the soft x - ray emitting gas .",
    "if the estimate is done on the same individual regions as the spectral analysis ( figure 7 ) , the total gas mass only decreases by 3% .",
    "the electron density ranges from 0.0080 @xmath49 @xmath43 to 0.017 @xmath49 @xmath43 along the tails . however , the abundance of the x - ray gas is too low for the one-@xmath14 fit , which results in gas densities that are too high .",
    "the ambient icm electron density and temperature in the projected position of s tails is @xmath50 @xmath43 and 6.3 kev respectively .",
    "this puts an upper limit of 0.010 @xmath43 on the electron density of the tail gas ( for a temperature of 0.8 kev ) if pressure equilibrium is assumed .",
    "thus , the one-@xmath14 model is not sufficient .",
    "do the two-@xmath14 fit and the cemekl fit produce more reasonable results ?",
    "we first used the result in the fourth row of table 1 , where the abundance of the lower temperature component is fixed at the solar value and the abundance of the higher temperature component is fixed at the value of the surrounding icm .",
    "assuming pressure equilibrium between these two components , it is found that the hotter component occupies 97% of the volume of the soft x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the electron density of the cool and hot components is 0.018 @xmath49 @xmath43 and 0.0071 @xmath49 @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the total x - ray gas mass is 1.4@xmath46 @xmath47 m@xmath7 .",
    "however , the gas pressure in the tail is @xmath0 50% higher than the maximum icm pressure of the surroundings .",
    "this problem can not be solved by increasing the abundance of the hotter component in the spectral fit , which will further increase the ism pressure .",
    "we then tried the cemekl fit ( the eighth row of table 1 ) .",
    "however , the x - ray tail is at least 3.2 times over - pressured to the surrounding icm , under an isobaric condition .",
    "the total x - ray gas mass is 1.1@xmath46 m@xmath7 .",
    "therefore , either these models are not adequate , or there is dynamic pressure ( e.g. , turbulence ) besides the thermal pressure . without better understanding of the tail spectrum and the contribution of the cold ism in the tails , it is difficult to much improve the above estimates .",
    "we summarize s properties from the current data in table 2 , along with those of  ( section 6 ) .",
    "we also examined the spectral properties of the icm around s tails .",
    "we followed the same approach as used in sun ( 2009 ) for eso  137 - 006 to determine the local soft x - ray background that is dominated by the galactic emission ( note the galactic latitude of -7 deg ) . with",
    "the soft x - ray background determined , icm temperatures were determined in 12 regions around s x - ray tails ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the projected icm temperature is about 6 kev around s tails .",
    "region # 8 has the lowest temperature , which implies the presence of a faint ism component in that region .",
    "indeed , the 0.6 - 2 kev surface brightness at region # 8 is a bit higher than that in regions # 11 and # 13 , ( 5.53@xmath160.13)@xmath37 cnts s@xmath3 kpc@xmath38 vs. ( 5.23@xmath160.10)@xmath37 cnts s@xmath3 kpc@xmath38 .",
    "region # 7 may include some small `` protrusions '' from both tails ( figure 1 ) , which can explain its relatively lower temperature than regions # 2 - # 6 .",
    "the icm abundance can also be determined from a simultaneous fit to the spectra of all regions , 0.20@xmath160.06 solar .",

    "( 2008 ) interpreted it as the consequence of the aspherical potential of m86 and m86 s orbit .",
    "m86 is an early - type galaxy so its potential structure is different from s and its tail is only composed of the stripped hot ism .",

    "ngc  4438 is @xmath0 3 times more luminous than  in the @xmath77 band .",
    "its truncated halo should be larger than s ( @xmath0 15 kpc in radius , s07 ) , also because the virgo cluster is less massive than a3627 . the features in ngc  4438 only extend to @xmath0 11 kpc from the nucleus , clearly within its halo .",
    "the other late - type galaxy in the proximity , ngc  4388 , has many h@xmath4 filaments and a spectacular hi tail ( yoshida et al .",
    "2002 ; oosterloo & van gorkom 2005 ) .",
    "a faint x - ray extension can be traced to @xmath0 14 kpc from the nucleus in the direction of the hi tail , from the  and  data .",
    "there is also an x - ray extension to east in the disk plane , which creates the appearance of double tails ( randall et al .",
    "ngc  4388 is @xmath0 1.5 times more luminous than  in the @xmath77 band so similar to ngc  4438 , its x - ray tail is still within its halo .",
    "thus , we do not consider the one - sided x - ray features in ngc  4438 and ngc  4388 to be x - ray double tails based upon the current data .",
    "they are clearly much fainter than s tails , especially given s much larger distance ( @xmath0 4.3 times ) and the much higher absorption to the direction of .",
    "we can also define strong x - ray tails as one - sided features outside of the tidal truncation radius of the galactic halo ( like the tails of  and ) , in order to distinguish them from the weak x - ray tails of ngc  4438 and ngc  4388 .",
    "the observed x - ray emission of the tails is likely from the interfaces of the hot icm and the cold stripped ism , reflecting the multi - phase nature of mixing .",
    "although the detailed mixing process that determines the emergent x - ray spectra is poorly understood , the observed tail temperature may be related to the mass - weighted temperature that is usually adopted in simulations , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and we assume that @xmath80 . for the x - ray tails of  and",
    ", @xmath81 if we assume @xmath82 is the observed spectroscopic temperature .",
    "however , it is easy to find out that the mass - weighted temperature is always larger than the spectroscopic temperature derived by fitting the observed spectra with a single-@xmath14 model ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we examined this with the cemekl and apec models . for the cemekl model , @xmath84 .",
    "assuming an isobaric condition and for @xmath85 -1 ,    @xmath86    for @xmath85 -0.5 , 1/3 @xmath87 .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume that @xmath88 .",

    "for example , @xmath83 = 0.5 - 1 kev when -0.5 @xmath90 0.5 , while @xmath82 = 2 - 3.6 kev for @xmath91 = 6 kev .",
    "this is not surprising as @xmath83 is mainly determined by the centroid of the iron - l hump at low temperatures , which biases @xmath83 low .",
    "as long as there are significant emission components at @xmath14 = 0.4 - 2 kev , the iron - l hump will be strong to make @xmath83 deviated from @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , the parameter @xmath4 in the cemekl model may reflect the age of the x - ray tail .",
    "our simulations indeed show that @xmath83 increases monotonously with @xmath4 . from the cemekl",
    "fits to the spectra of  and , s stripping event may indeed be older .",
    "the above simple estimate implies that @xmath83 is a certain fraction of the icm temperature .",
    "the luminosity of the x - ray tail should also increase with the magnitude of the ambient icm pressure , under an isobaric condition .",
    "thus , the x - ray tails of late - type galaxies in groups and the outskirts of poor clusters may have temperatures ( e.g. , @xmath92 0.4 kev ) and densities too low to be bright in the  and  energy bands .",
    "this helps to explain the paucity of strong x - ray tails of late - type galaxies in nearby clusters ( e.g. , sun et al .",
    "other factors include the generally high cluster background and the small number of late - type galaxies in the  field of nearby clusters as the covered cluster volume is small .    with the above scenario ,",
    "the x - ray tail of a late - type galaxy is simply the manifestation of its cold ism tail embedded in the hot icm .",

    "soft x - ray emission of the tail may only be bright in high - pressure environment .",
    "we also understand little about the details of mixing . it may be related to the mean free path of particles and the coherence length of the magnetic field , which would introduce a radial dependence on the efficiency of mixing . nevertheless , we first need better data to update the venn diagram shown in figure 15",
    ".    deep x - ray data alone , like s , can reveal some thermal history of the stripped ism .",
    "one surprise from s x - ray data is the constancy of the spectroscopic temperatures along both tails ( figure 7 ) .",
    "indeed extra care is required to interpret this spectroscopic temperature as it is mainly determined by the centroid of the combined iron - l humps from multi-@xmath99 gas .",
    "nevertheless , the possible spectral difference between s tails and s tail is intriguing .",
    "this difference , if confirmed , combined with the temperature constancy of s tails , puts a constraint on the heating timescale of the stripped cold ism . clearly the knowledge of the hi / co gas distribution in these two galaxies will help to tighten the constraint , although it is certain that this timescale depends on the icm temperature .",

    "the simulated x - ray tails are also very clumpy , with widths generally increasing with the distance from the galaxy .",
    "the flash simulations also produce longer tails than observed in this work , but are difficult to compare with the x - ray data directly .",
    "as rb08 pointed out , the observed tail length depends on the mass - loss per orbital length , which is the highest in poor clusters as galaxies in rich clusters move too fast and the ram pressure in groups is not high enough",
    ". the flash simulations also show tail flaring ( i.e. increasing width with distance from the galaxy downstream ) in all cases .",
    "the velocity perpendicular to the direction of the ram pressure comes from the random motion of the icm , the disk rotation and turbulence in the wake . for a rotation velocity of 100 km / s over 50 myr ,",
    "the offset is 5 kpc , which is not small in s case as its tails are narrow .",

    "the radius of the remaining h@xmath4 disk and the galactic x - ray emission is only @xmath0 1.7 kpc ( s07 ) .",
    "thus , the reynold number is on the order of unity which implies a laminar flow .",
    "of course the presence of magnetic field would increase the reynold number . in the simulations by kapferer",
    "( 2009 ) , a bright spot in the x - ray images is always found at distances of a few tens of kpc from the galaxy , caused by compressional heating .",
    "this feature can be compared with the bright spot in the main tail ( figure 1 and 5 ) . however , the location of this feature is generally too far from the galaxy in simulations with high ambient pressure .",
    "such a bright spot is also not observed in the secondary tail .",
    "the most obvious question about s x - ray tails is why are there double tails .",
    "the simplest explanation is to involve another dwarf galaxy forming a pair with .",
    "this was in fact simulated by kapferer et al .",

    "the x - ray gas mass of the secondary tail is 40% - 50% of the mass of the main tail , assuming the same filling factors of the x - ray gas .",
    "if we simply take the ratio of their x - ray gas masses as the ratio of their ism gas masses , the stellar mass of this assumed dwarf that is responsible for the secondary tail should be @xmath0 30% of s stellar mass , from the ism mass - stellar mass relation summarized by blanton & moustakas ( 2009 ) .",
    "such a galaxy should be easily detected , at least through the tidal tails and bridge it causes even if it hides behind .",

    "the discovery of two separated stripping tails from one galaxy presents a challenge to our understanding of stripping . in simulations ( e.g. , rb08 ; kapferer et al .",
    "2009 ; tonnesen & bryan 2009 ) , cold ism is removed from the sides of the disk or through holes and is quickly mixed to form one clumpy tail because of disk rotation , momentum transferred from the icm and turbulence in the wake , especially if projected on the plane of sky .",
    "perhaps we should begin to consider more realistic ism distributions in the galaxy .",
    "optical images clearly show the presence of two thick spiral arms , one to the north and the other one to the south ( s07 ; better shown in the  images ) .",
    "maybe the two x - ray tails correspond to stripping of molecular gas concentrated around these two spiral arms .",
    "co images of nearby face - on spiral galaxies indeed show that molecular gas distribution follows major spiral arms in many cases ( e.g. , kuno et al . 2007 ) .",
    "this is also generally true for hi gas ( e.g. , adler & westpfahl 1996 ) . for",
    ", we present a simple cartoon in figure 16 .",
    "the north arm is apparently the trailing arm where stripping is easier so a brighter x - ray tail is produced .",
    "the south arm is the leading arm so gas removal there is more difficult as most gas would be pushed inwards to deeper galactic potential first .",
    "this also explains the fact that more intracluster hii regions ( at @xmath104 15 kpc from the nucleus ) are found around the main tail while the numbers of hii regions in the halo are similar at two sides .",
    "the curvature of the secondary tail may come from the galactic rotation , which is high enough to cause the observed offset .",
    "the main tail may also be curved in 3d but appears straight in projection .",
    "the rather regular wake structure may imply significant viscosity . on the other hand , draping of the icm magnetic field ( e.g. , dursi & pfrommer 2008 ) can also inhibit the motion of the stripped ism perpendicular to the direction of ram pressure .    in summary",
    ", it remains to be seen whether simulations can reproduce the double x - ray tails of  as observed , and the gas properties in other bands ( h@xmath4 and h@xmath20 at least ) .",
    "we also emphasize that the comparison between data and simulations is not trivial and straightforward .",
    "observationally we need deeper data at multiple wavelengths . for simulations ,",
    "mock data need to be produced with sensitivities matching the actual observations .",
    "uncertainties in the viscosity , heat conduction , cooling and stellar feedback should be explored with different runs .",
    "eventually we need to compare the multi - wavelength data ( hi , co , ir , optical and x - rays ) with the mock data in the same band . besides the simple comparison of morphology , a lot of details of the tail properties ( e.g. , temperature distribution , filling factors of the gas in different phases and energy transfer between gas in different phases ) can be better examined .      the new observations of , for the first time , unambiguously confirm the active star formation in the cold ism stripped by the icm ram pressure .",
    "as emphasized in s07 , s immediate surroundings are devoid of bright galaxies .",
    "there are only two galaxies that are within 4 mag of  in the @xmath61 band , within 100 kpc from the end of s x - ray tail ( g1 and g2 in figure 1 of s07 ) .",
    "their redshifts are unknown and they are 1.9 - 2.7 mag fainter than  in the @xmath61 band .",
    "there is also no such galaxy within 70 kpc from the nucleus of .",
    "both g1 and g2 are undisturbed and there are no tidal features between  and g1 ( or g2 ) .",
    "our  data do not reveal another dwarf galaxy near  ( paper iv , in preparation ) .",
    "the velocity map of the hii regions also shows no extra component , besides s rotation pattern .",
    "it is also known that the cluster potential is not the main factor for stripping ( s07 ; sivanandam et al .",
    "2010 ) , although it indeed affects the size of s dark matter halo .",
    "thus , we conclude that icm ram pressure is responsible for the stripping of the ism . in our case ,",
    "the ambient pressure is even high enough to remove some molecular gas from the galaxy .",
    "the hi gas has typical pressures of @xmath105 k @xmath43 , while the pressure in the core of a starless giant molecular cloud can be higher than @xmath106 k @xmath43 . the ambient total thermal pressure ( electron + ions )",
    "is 1.3@xmath107 k @xmath43 for @xmath52 = 10@xmath53 @xmath43 and @xmath14=6 kev , while the ram pressure is 3.2@xmath107 k @xmath43 for @xmath52 = 10@xmath53 @xmath43 and @xmath54 = 1500 km / s .    after removing the cold ism from the galaxy ,",
    "the key for the intracluster star formation is that the stripped ism must be able to cool , likely aided by shocks and the absence of the uv radiation field that is strong on the disk plane .",
    "intracluster star formation in the stripped ism was first suggested in simulations ( schulz & struck 2001 ; vollmer et al .",
    "schulz & struck ( 2001 ) even suggested formation of dwarf galaxies in this mode . in the new gadget-2/sph simulations by kronberger et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and kapferer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , new stars are formed in the stripped ism , forming @xmath0 1 kpc structures with masses of up to 10@xmath108 m@xmath7 individually to hundreds of kpc downstream of the galaxy .",
    "however , all simulations suffer from uncertainties in transport processes like viscosity and heat conduction , which are important for determining the heating rate .    more evidence of intracluster star formation ,",
    "either hii regions or blue star clusters , has been revealed recently ( e.g. , lee et al . 2000 ; gerhard et al .",
    "2002 ; cortese et al . 2004 ; cortese et al . 2007 ; yoshida et al .",
    "they are only at one side of the galaxy . in some cases",
    ", tidal interaction may be important ( e.g. , lee et al . 2000 ) .",
    "but they all lack unambiguous associations with gaseous tails .",
    "we especially highlight the growing number of examples of one - sided blue stellar filaments and star clusters behind cluster galaxies , which includes two galaxies in a2667 and a1689 at @xmath109 0.2 ( cortese et al .",
    "2007 ) and a dwarf galaxy rb  199 in the coma cluster ( yoshida et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the connection between the first two galaxies at @xmath110 with  was discussed in s07 . in the case of rb  199 , yoshida et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found narrow blue filaments , knots , h@xmath4 filaments and clouds extending to 80 kpc from the galaxy in one side .",
    "it is a rather remarkable case as the galaxy is much fainter than all previous galaxies , with a stellar mass of @xmath111 m@xmath7 .",
    "the stellar mass of the downstream structures is @xmath112 m@xmath7 , which is @xmath0 10% of the galactic mass .",
    "yoshida et al . ( 2008 ) also favored a mechanism similar to what we suggested for in s07 .",
    "these three examples may imply a rather common evolution stage for cluster late - type galaxies .",
    "as the stage with bright blue stellar trails is short ( @xmath55 200 myr ) , more similar examples are expected only in large surveys .",
    "if we assume that intracluster star formation happens in the stripped ism of every cluster spiral , can this mode contribute a significant fraction of the intracluster light ?",
    "the answer depends on the mass fraction of intracluster stars formed out of the stripped ism ( or the star formation efficiency ) .",
    "s07 gave a rough estimate of @xmath0 1% , which may only be a lower estimate as blue stellar filaments and clusters ( not shining in h@xmath4 ) are not counted . while a detailed account of the total stellar mass downstream of  is the aim of paper iv , here we take 1% as a lower limit .",
    "if the efficiency of the intracluster star formation is only 1% , the intracluster light contributed from star formation in stripped ism is small , given the mass fraction of the intracluster light to the total stellar light in clusters ( @xmath0 20% , likely depending on the halo mass , e.g. , krick & bernstein 2007 ) .",
    "however , the case of rb  199 implies a fraction of @xmath0 10% , if the original ism in rb  199 had a mass comparable to its stellar mass ( e.g. , blanton & moustakas 2009 ) . in the simulations by kronberger et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and kapferer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , 7% - 12% of the initial ism turns into new stars in the wake . if an efficiency of 10% is adopted , the intracluster light contributed by ram pressure stripping is a significant fraction of the total intracluster light .",
    "however , this efficiency may not be too high given the star formation efficiency in galaxies .",
    "in galactic disks , @xmath0 1% of gas is converted to stars per free - fall time ( e.g. , leroy et al . 2008 ) . in 100 myr ( a typical orbital time in the disks ) , @xmath0 6% of gas is converted to stars ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ; leroy et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we note that 100 myr is also about the orbital time of the residual h@xmath4 disk ( @xmath0 1.7 kpc radius with an orbital velocity of @xmath0 100 km / s ) and close to the age of the x - ray tails .",
    "clearly , a lot of work is required to constrain the intracluster star formation efficiency .",
    "the efficiency may also change with the mass of the host galaxy as more stars are formed inside the halo of more massive galaxies . in principle , the ratio of the intracluster snia to the other types can also inform us the significance of intracluster star formation .    as active star formation is confirmed downstream of the galaxy , the discovery of ulxs is not a surprise . as we estimated in section 5.2 , the total luminosity of ulxs can be consistent with the expectation from the intracluster star formation rate .",
    "the space density of x - ray point sources also traces the strength of the star formation , stronger in the halo and weaker around the unbound tail . a similar system may be the high - velocity system of ngc  1275 .",

    "the whole tail system exhibits intriguing regularity ( almost constant tail widths , constant spectroscopic temperatures and well separated tails not twisted together ) and some complexity ( substructures ) .",
