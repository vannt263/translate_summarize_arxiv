    "the development of molecular scale electronic devices has attracted a great deal of interest in the past decade , although major experimental and theoretical challenges still exist .",
    "@xcite to date precise experimental control of molecular conformation is lacking , resulting in large uncertainties in the measured conductance . on the theory side , while the green s function ( gf ) method has achieved many successes in describing electron transport at the meso @xcite and molecular @xcite scales , issues such as dynamical electron correlation and large electron - phonon coupling effects @xcite are far from fully resolved .",
    "it is therefore desirable to exploit alternative approaches for comparison with the mainstream gf calculations . in this paper , we describe a first step towards this goal by computing how an electron propagates through a molecular junction in real time , based on the time - dependent density functional theory @xcite ( tddft ) .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite with the kohn - sham reference kinetic energy functional of a fictitious non - interacting electron system @xcite is a leading method for treating many electrons in solids and molecules . @xcite . while initially formulated to describe only the electronic ground state @xcite , it has been rigorously extended by runge and gross @xcite to treat time - dependent , driven systems ( excited states ) .",
    "tddft is therefore a natural theoretical platform for studying electron conduction at the nanoscale .",
    "there are two flavors in which tddft is implemented .",
    "one is direct numerical integration @xcite of the time - dependent kohn - sham ( tdks ) equations .",
    "the other is a _ gedanken experiment _ of the former with an added assumption of infinitesimal time - dependent perturbation , so a linear response function may be first derived in closed form @xcite , which is then evaluated numerically .",
    "these two implementations should give exactly the same result when the external perturbation field is infinitesimal .",
    "the latter implementation can be computationally more efficient once the linear - response function has been analytically derived , while the former can treat non - infinitesimal perturbations and arbitrary initial states .",
    "a key step of the tddft dynamics is updating of the kohn - sham effective potential by the present _ excited - state _ charge density @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "this is what sets tddft apart from the ground - state dft estimate of excitation energies , even when tddft is applied in its crudest , so - called adiabatic approximation , @xcite whereby the same exchange - correlation density functional form as the ground - state dft calculation is used ( for example , the so - called tdlda approximation uses exactly the same ceperley - alder - perdew - zunger functional @xcite as the ground - state lda calculation . )",
    "this difference in excitation energies comes about because in a ground - state dft calculation , a virtual orbital such as lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) experiences an effective potential due to @xmath3 electrons occupying the lowest @xmath3 orbitals ; whereas in a tddft calculation , if one electron is excited to a lumo - like orbital , it sees @xmath4 electrons occupying the lowest @xmath4 orbitals , plus its own charge density . also , the excitation energy is defined by the collective reaction of this coupled dynamical system to time - dependent perturbation ( pole in the response function ) @xcite , rather than simple algebraic differences between present virtual and occupied orbital energies . for rather involved reasons beyond what is discussed here , tddft under the adiabatic approximation gives significantly improved excitation spectra @xcite , although there are still much to be desired .",
    "further systematic improvements to tddft such as current density functional @xcite and self - interaction correction @xcite have already made great strides .    presently , most electronic conductance calculations based on the landauer transmission formalism @xcite have assumed a static molecular geometry . in the landauer picture ,",
    "dissipation of the conducting electron energy is assumed to take place in the metallic leads ( electron reservoirs ) , not in the narrow molecular junction ( channel ) itself .",
    "@xcite inelastic scattering , however , does occur in the molecular junctions themselves , the effects appearing as peaks or dips in the measured inelastic electron tunneling spectra ( iets ) @xcite at molecular vibrational eigen - frequencies . since heating is always an important concern for high - density electronics , and because molecular junctions tend to be mechanically more fragile compared to larger , semiconductor - based devices , the issue of electron - phonon coupling warrants detailed calculations @xcite ( here we use the word phonon to denote general vibrations when there is no translational symmetry ) . in the case of long @xmath5-conjugated polymer chain junctions , strong electron - phonon coupling may even lead to new elementary excitations and spin or charge carriers , called soliton / polaron @xcite , where the electronic excitation is so entangled with phonon excitation that separation is no longer possible .    in view of the above background",
    ", there is a need for efficient tddft implementations that can treat complex electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions in the time domain .",
    "linear - response type analytic derivations can become very cumbersome , and for some problems @xcite may be entirely infeasible",
    ". a direct time - stepping method @xcite analogous to molecular dynamics for electrons as well as ions may be more flexible and intuitive in treating some of these highly complex and coupled problems , _ if _ the computational costs can be managed .",
    "such a direct time - stepping code also can be used to double - check the correctness of analytic approaches such as the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method and electron - phonon scattering calculations @xcite , most of which explicitly or implicitly use the same set of tddft approximations ( most often an adiabatic approximation such as tdlda ) .",
    "two issues are of utmost importance when it comes to computational cost : choice of basis and pseudopotential . for ground - state dft calculations that involve a significant number of metal atoms ( e.g. surface catalysis ) ,",
    "the method that tends to achieve the best cost - performance compromise is the ultrasoft pseudopotential ( uspp ) @xcite with planewave basis , and an independent and theoretically more rigorous formulation , the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) @xcite method .",
    "compared to the more traditional norm - conserving pseudopotential approaches , uspp / paw achieve dramatic cost savings for first - row @xmath6- and @xmath7-elements , with minimal loss of accuracy .",
    "uspp / paw are the workhorses in popular codes such as vasp @xcite and dacapo @xcite .",
    "we note that similar to surface catalysis problems , metal - molecule interaction at contact is the key for electron conduction across molecular junctions",
    ". therefore it seems reasonable to explore how tddft , specifically tdks under the adiabatic approximation , performs in the uspp / paw framework , which may achieve similar cost - performance benefits .",
    "this is the main distinction between our approach and the software package octopus @xcite , a ground - breaking tddft program with direct time stepping , but which uses norm - conserving troullier - martins ( tm ) pseudopotential @xcite , and real - space grids .",
    "we will address the theoretical formulation of td - uspp ( td - paw ) in sec .",
    "ii , and the numerical implementation of td - uspp in the direct time - stepping flavor in sec .",
    "iii .    to validate that the direct time - integration uspp - tddft algorithm indeed works ,",
    "we calculate the optical absorption spectra of sodium dimer and benzene molecule in sec .",
    "iv and compare them with experimental results and other tdlda calculations .",
    "as an application , we perform a computer experiment in sec .",
    "v which is a verbatim implementation of the original landauer picture @xcite .",
    "an electron wave pack comes from the left metallic lead ( 1d au chain ) with an energy that is exactly the fermi energy of the metal ( the fermi electron ) , and undergoes scattering by the molecular junction ( benzene-(1,4)-dithiolate , or bdt ) .",
    "the probability of electron transmission is carefully analyzed in density vs. @xmath8 plots .",
    "the point of this exercise is to check the stability and accuracy of the time integrator , rather than to obtain new results about the au - bdt - au junction conductance .",
    "we check the transmission probability thus obtained with simple estimate from complex band structure calculations @xcite , and green s function calculations at small bias voltages . both seem to be consistent with our calculations .",
    "lastly , we give a brief summary in sec . vi .",
    "the key idea of uspp / paw @xcite is a mapping of the true valence electron wavefunction @xmath9 to a pseudowavefunction @xmath10 : @xmath11 , like in any pseudopotential scheme .",
    "however , by discarding the requirement that @xmath10 must be norm - conserved ( @xmath12 ) while matching @xmath9 outside the pseudopotential cutoff , a greater smoothness of @xmath10 in the core region can be achieved ; and therefore less planewaves are required to represent @xmath10 . in order for the physics to still work ,",
    "one must define augmentation charges in the core region , and solve a generalized eigenvalue problem @xmath13 instead of the traditional eigenvalue problem , where @xmath14 is a hermitian and positive definite operator .",
    "@xmath14 specifies the fundamental measure of the linear hilbert space of pseudowavefunctions .",
    "physically meaningful inner product between two pseudowavefunctions is always @xmath15 instead of @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , @xmath17 between the eigenfunctions of ( [ uspp - ks ] ) because it is actually not physically meaningful , but @xmath18 is .",
    "( please note that @xmath19 is used to denote the true wavefunction with nodal structure , and @xmath20 to denote pseudowavefunction , which are opposite in some papers . )",
    "@xmath21 consists of the kinetic energy operator @xmath22 , ionic local pseudopotential @xmath23 , ionic nonlocal pseudopotential @xmath24 , hartree potential @xmath25 , and exchange - correlation potential @xmath26 , @xmath27 the @xmath14 operator is given by @xmath28 is the angular momentum channel number , and @xmath29 labels the ions .",
    "@xmath14 contains contributions from all ions in the supercell , just as the total pseudopotential operator @xmath30 , which is the sum of pseudopotential operators of all ions . in above ,",
    "the projector function @xmath31 of atom @xmath29 s channel @xmath32 is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ion position , and @xmath35 vanishes outside the pseudopotential cutoff .",
    "these projector functions appear in the nonlocal pseudopotential @xmath36 the coefficients @xmath37 are the unscreened scattering strengths , while the coefficients @xmath38 need to be self - consistently updated with the electron density @xmath39 in which @xmath40 is the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "@xmath41 is the charge augmentation function , i.e. , the difference between the true wavefunction charge ( interference ) and the pseudocharge for selected channels , @xmath42 which vanishes outside the cutoff .",
    "there is also @xmath43 terms in eq .",
    "( [ q_charge ] ) are evaluated using two different grids , a sparse grid for the wavefunctions @xmath44 and a dense grid for the augmentation functions @xmath41 .",
    "ultrasoft pseudopotentials are thus fully specified by the functions @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath37 , and @xmath47 .",
    "forces on ions and internal stress on the supercell can be derived analytically using linear response theory @xcite .    to extend the above ground - state uspp formalism to the time - dependent case",
    ", we note that the @xmath14 operator in ( [ uspp - ks ] ) depends on the ionic positions @xmath48 only and _ not _ on the electronic charge density . in the case that the ions are not moving ,",
    "the following dynamical equations are equivalent : @xmath49 whereby we have replaced the @xmath50 in ( [ uspp - ks ] ) by the @xmath51 operator , and @xmath52 is updated using the time - dependent @xmath1 .",
    "however when the ions are moving , @xmath53 with difference proportional to the ionic velocities . to resolve this ambiguity",
    ", we note that @xmath14 can be split as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a unitary operator , @xmath56 , and we can rewrite ( [ uspp - ks ] ) as @xmath57 referring to the paw formulation @xcite , we can select @xmath55 such that @xmath58 is the paw transformation operator @xmath59 that maps the pseudowavefunction to the true wavefunction .",
    "so we can rewrite ( [ uspp - intermediate ] ) as , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is then the true all - electron hamiltonian ( with core - level electrons frozen ) . in the all - electron tddft procedure ,",
    "the above @xmath50 is replaced by the @xmath62 operator .",
    "it is thus clear that a physically meaningful td - uspp equation in the case of moving ions should be @xmath63 or @xmath64 in the equivalent paw notation , it is simply , @xmath65 or , in pseudized form amenable to numerical calculations , @xmath66 differentiating ( [ paw_transformation ] ) , there is , @xmath67 and so we can define and calculate @xmath68 operator , similar to analytic force calculation @xcite . the td - uspp / td - paw equation therefore can be rearranged as , @xmath69 with @xmath70 proportional to the ionic velocities .",
    "it is basically the same as traditional tddft equation , but taking into account the moving spatial `` gauge '' due to ion motion . as such",
    "it can be used to model electron - phonon coupling @xcite , cluster dynamics under strong laser field @xcite , etc .",
    ", as long as the pseudopotential cores are not overlapping , and the core - level electrons are not excited .    at each timestep , one should update @xmath1 as @xmath71 note that while @xmath72 may be an eigenstate if we start from the ground - state wavefunctions , @xmath73 generally is no longer so with the external field turned on .",
    "@xmath74 is therefore merely used as a label based on the initial state rather than an eigenstate label at @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 on the other hand always maintains its initial value , @xmath77 , for a particular simulation run .",
    "one may define projection operator @xmath78 belonging to atom @xmath29 : @xmath79 @xmath78 spatially has finite support , and so is @xmath80 therefore @xmath81 in ( [ poperator ] ) is , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the electron momentum operator . unfortunately @xmath81 and therefore @xmath70 are not hermitian operators .",
    "this means that the numerical algorithm for integrating ( [ td - uspp - paw ] ) may be different from the special case of immobile ions : @xmath84 even if the same time - stepping algorithm is used , the error estimates would be different . in section iii",
    "we discuss algorithms for integrating ( [ td - uspp - immobile ] ) only , and postpone detailed discussion of integration algorithm and error estimates for coupled ion - electron dynamics ( [ td - uspp - paw ] ) under uspp to a later paper .",

    "algebraic expansions of different order are then performed on the above propagator , leading to various numerical time - stepping algorithms .      to first - order accuracy in time",

    "although the explicit scheme ( [ expliciteuler ] ) is less expensive computationally , our test runs indicate that it always diverges numerically .",
    "the reason is that ( [ td - uspp - immobile ] ) has poles on the imaginary axis , which are marginally outside of the stability domain ( @xmath90 ) of the explicit algorithm .",

    "since this is a first - order algorithm , neither choice would influence the order of the local truncation error . through numerical tests we found that the implicit time differentiation in ( [ impliciteuler ] ) already imparts sufficient stability that the @xmath92 operator is not needed .",

    "we solve ( [ impliciteuler - rearranged - final ] ) iteratively using matrix - free linear equation solvers such as the conjugate gradient method .",
    "starting from the wavefunction of a previous timestep , we find that typically it takes about three to five conjugate gradient steps to achieve sufficiently convergent update .    one serious drawback of this algorithm is that norm conservation of the wavefunction @xmath94 is not satisfied exactly , even if there is perfect floating - point operation accuracy .",
    "so one has to renormalize the wavefunction after several timesteps .",
    "we find the following crank - nicolson expansion @xcite of propagator ( [ td - uspp - immobile - propagator ] ) @xmath95 stable enough for practical use .",
    "the norm of the wavefunction is conserved explicitly in the absence of roundoff errors , because of the spectral identity @xmath96 therefore ( [ td - uspp - norm - conservation ] ) is satisfied in an ideal numerical computation , and in practice one does not have to renormalize the wavefunctions in thousands of timesteps .",
    "writing out the ( [ td - uspp - first - order - crank - nicolson - expansion ] ) expansion explicitly , we have : @xmath97\\psi_{n }      ( t+\\delta t ) = \\left [ \\hat{s } - \\frac{i}{2\\hbar } \\hat{h}(t ) \\delta      t\\right ] \\psi_{n}(t ) .",
