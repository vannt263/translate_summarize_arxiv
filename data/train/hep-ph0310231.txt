    "the @xmath10 reaction is important in the analysis of the low energy @xmath11 scattering because of its role as a major inelastic process .",
    "since the pion mass is small owing to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , the contribution of the @xmath12 channel is observed even around the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "many theoretical approaches have been taken to study this reaction : for example , the phenomenological model using effective lagrangian  @xcite and a series of systematic analyses based on the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "also , the several kinds of global fits of the experimental data have been performed  @xcite .",
    "these studies show that the @xmath10 reaction is useful to extract some important aspects of hadron physics .",
    "the @xmath13 scattering length is obtained by using the @xmath10 data . furthermore valuable information taken from the @xmath10 reaction",
    "benefits the study of baryon resonances which have a considerable influence on this reaction .",
    "in particular , the contribution of @xmath0 is remarkable around the threshold region .",
    "because @xmath14(1232 ) contributes to the @xmath10 reaction through three typical interactions , i.e. , the @xmath15 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 interactions , the information of these interactions can be accessible through the analysis of this reaction .",
    "however the @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions have not been taken seriously in the theoretical analyses so far .",
    "these interactions are not included in ref .",
    "@xcite , and their contributions to the @xmath7 channel are shown to be negligible in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , many types of interactions including the @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions are considered in the global fits  @xcite , but their individual roles in each channel of the @xmath10 reaction are not discussed . the @xmath2 and @xmath3 interactions still remain controversial in contrast to the well known @xmath15 interaction .",
    "chiral symmetry is a key to systematic understanding of the pion related reactions including the @xmath10 reaction .",
    "this symmetry has been accepted as a fundamental concept in the hadron physics due to the successes of the various low energy theorems  @xcite and the chiral perturbation theory in the threshold region  @xcite .",
    "these studies are based on spontaneous broken chiral symmetry , where the pions are considered as the nambu - goldstone bosons realized by this symmetry breaking .",
    "recently , a general framework analyzing hadron reactions has been developed by yamagishi and zahed  @xcite on the basis of chiral symmetry .",
    "this framework introduces a new type of reduction formula , i.e. the chiral reduction formula , which manifests a requirement of chiral symmetry satisfied by the invariant amplitudes not only for the threshold region but for the resonance region .",
    "it is worth noting that the chiral reduction formula offers the ward identity satisfied by the quantum amplitudes without relying on any model or expansion scheme at the beginning .",
    "this identity allows us to take a flexible and consistent view , which is free from restrictions given by specific model , of the theoretical approach to resonances  @xcite .    in this paper , applying the chiral reduction formula to the invariant amplitude of the @xmath16 reaction , we try to clarify the contribution of @xmath0 in this reaction to tree level .",
