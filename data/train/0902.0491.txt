    "the oncoming limits of conventional downscaling of field - effect transistors have strengthened the need for innovative device architectures.@xcite in this context , the use of mechanical strains has become an attractive solution to improve the electrical performances by enhancing the carrier mobility.@xcite as a matter of fact , strain engineering techniques such as the growth of a contact etch stop layer ( cesl),@xcite or si channels strained by sige source and drain extensions are now widely spread in the semiconductor industry . more generally , the electronic properties of strained si@xmath4ge@xmath5 layers grown on si@xmath6ge@xmath7 buffers are attracting much attention.@xcite these heterostructures , that can be integrated into si - based electronics and photonics , indeed offer the opportunity to tune the band gap of the active layer .",
    "the modeling of the electrical properties of such devices requires a detailed description of the effects of strains on the band structure . over the past decades",
    ", the _ ab initio _ methods such as the density functional theory@xcite ( dft ) have provided comprehensive information about the deformation potentials of semiconductors.@xcite however , such _ ab initio _ methods require heavy computational resources and are not , therefore , suitable for the calculation of the transport properties of large systems .",
    "for that reason , the physics and electronic device community is actively developing more efficient semi - empirical approaches , such as the @xmath8,@xcite the empirical pseudopotential@xcite or the tight - binding@xcite ( tb ) methods , that can work out the electronic structure of strained semiconductors devices . among these semi - empirical approaches ,",
    "the tb method has long proved successful in predicting the electronic properties of semiconductor nanostructures such as nanocrystals or nanowires .",
    "the use of an atomic orbitals basis set with interactions limited to a few nearest neighbors indeed allows the calculation of the wave functions of million atom systems.@xcite the tb method is also well suited to quantum transport calculations,@xcite and to the atomic scale description of , e.g. , impurities@xcite or electron - phonon coupling.@xcite in this respect , the first nearest neighbors @xmath0 model is one of the most accurate and efficient tb description of semiconductor materials.@xcite    the effects of strains are accounted for in tb models through the bond length dependence of the nearest neighbor parameters @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 being two orbitals on different atoms ) , which is usually fitted to a power law:@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath3 is the distance between the two atoms in the strained crystal and @xmath13 is the equilibrium distance . although some hydrostatic and uniaxial deformation potentials can be reproduced that way,@xcite much better accuracy can be achieved with the introduction of strain - dependent on - site parameters.@xcite indeed , hydrostatic strain shifts the average potential@xcite in the crystal , while uniaxial and shear strains split the @xmath2 or @xmath3 orbitals of a given atom . in their original @xmath0 parametrization , jancu _",
    "et al._@xcite therefore introduced a term that lifts the degeneracy between the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 orbitals under uniaxial @xmath17 strain .",
    "jancu and voisin later generalized this approach to uniaxial @xmath18 strain.@xcite these hamiltonians , however , feature the macroscopic strains @xmath19 , whose expression as a function of the atomic positions ( the basic input of the tb method ) is not univocal .",
    "et al._@xcite therefore introduced position - dependent orbital energies in the @xmath0 hamiltonian .",
    "they could reproduce that way the valence band deformation potentials @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but did not really improve on @xmath22 .",
    "this limitation is a consequence of the `` diagonal '' assumption made in that model .",
    "uniaxial @xmath23 strain indeed leaves , for example , the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 orbitals of a given atom equivalent .",
    "it however couples these orbitals off the diagonal of the hamiltonian .    in this paper , we discuss a model for the on - site matrix elements of the @xmath0 tb model , based on an explicit expression for the crystal field , assuming that the total potential is the sum of central , atomic contributions.@xcite it features off - diagonal couplings between different orbitals , and is able to reproduce the effects of arbitrary strains on the band energies and effective masses at all relevant k - points .",
    "it only involves a few additional parameters , is fully consistent with the symmetries of the crystal , and is free from any ambiguity that might arise from the introduction of the macroscopic strains @xmath19 in an atomistic description .",
    "we present this model in section [ sectionmodel ] , then discuss its properties in section [ sectiondiscussion ] .",
    "finally , we apply this model to silicon , germanium and their alloys , which are the most relevant materials for microelectronics , in section [ sectionapplications ] .",
    "we provide detailed comparisons with _ ab initio _ data on strained si , ge and sige , and discuss two important problems : the increase of the longitudinal effective mass under shear strains ( missing in previous tb models ) , and the description of random alloys .",
    "in this section , we introduce the model for the on - site matrix elements of the @xmath0 tight - binding hamiltonian . for the sake of simplicity , we focus on a homogeneously strained diamond or zinc - blende crystal , the application to arbitrary strains and other crystal structures being straightforward .",

    "approximation , the potential experienced by the orbitals of atom @xmath30 on sublattice 1 is therefore : @xmath31 this potential shifts the energy of the orbitals and couples them one to each other in the strained crystal . in particular , @xmath32 might lift the degeneracy between the @xmath2 or between the @xmath3 orbitals of the atom .",
    "our model is actually based on a first - order expansion of the on - site matrix elements of the potential @xmath32 as a function of the atomic positions . in the following ,",

    "however , only 9 of them appeared to have significant impact on the electronic structure of strained si and ge around the band gap ( see table [ tableparamssigestrains ] for a list ) .",

    "the reasons are twofold : first , the orbitals hidden behind orthogonal tb models are much more complex than usually assumed when discussing the sign of the interactions .",
    "the radial parts must indeed have at least one zero to fulfill ( near ) orthogonality relations with the neighboring atoms .",
    "second , some deformation potentials , such as @xmath21 and @xmath143 , are independent on the first ( but not on the second ) nearest neighbor harisson parameters ( @xmath21 , for example depends , on @xmath139 and @xmath85 only ) .",
    "the on - site parameters will therefore likely renormalize the missing long - range interactions beyond their `` bare '' definition given in section [ subsectionp ] and appendix [ appendixcouplings ] .",
    "the renormalization of long - range interactions into first nearest neighbor and on - site terms is underlying every short - range tb model and is a key of their success .",
