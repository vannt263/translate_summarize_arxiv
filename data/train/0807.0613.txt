    "contacts between surfaces are central to a wide range of technologies and present an interesting array of fundamental issues .",
    "contact behavior may involve phenomena as diverse as adhesion , friction , bonding , wear and fracture .",
    "most contact problems are intrinsically multiscale ; involving atomic bonding , nano - scale asperities , defect nucleation , elastic and plastic deformation , surface roughness , far - field loading , etc .",
    "the atomistic or nano - scale regime is particularly relevant since this is the length scale at which the first contact between rough surfaces occurs .",
    "furthermore , recent technological applications like micro electro mechanical systems  @xcite ( mems ) use mechanical contacts that are only a few micrometers large , such that nanoscale contact physics plays an even greater role .",
    "because of its large electrical conductivity , gold has become a popular material for electrical contacts .",
    "nevertheless , its application to micro - contact technology like mems switches has been hindered by a lack of reliability .",
    "extensive surface damage leads to failure of some gold contact devices after only several million open / close cycles .  @xcite the resulting surface damage has been studied experimentally with atomic force microscopes in order to understand the effect of adhesion , thermal dissipation and contamination .",
    "@xcite alloying au with other metals results in increased hardness , but also in increased resistivity .",
    "@xcite atomic - level simulations  @xcite and experimental observations@xcite have shown that the separation of gold contacts is accompanied by substantial plastic deformation , leading to ductile material separation with considerable material transfer from one side of the contact to the other .",
    "this results in significant contact surface morphology evolution in each cycle .",
    "other pure metals , like ruthenium , have recently been used to build metal contacts in mems switches .",
    "ruthenium contacts have proven to be more reliable , routinely surviving millions of cycles without significant degradation of the contacts .",
    "@xcite while au contacts have been the focus of several atomistic simulations , to our knowledge , there have been no atomistic simulation studies of contact between ru surfaces .",
    "therefore , we do not know whether the fundamental contact evolution mechanisms observed in au occur for other metals generally , and to the important case of ru , in particular .",
    "information of this type can help guide the development of future generations of mems contact switches .",
    "a comparison of au and ru contact behavior is also interesting because the crystal structures of ru ( hexagonal closed packed ) and au ( face centered cubic ) differ : this can lead to fundamental differences in crystal plasticity .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation is a powerful tool for studying adhesion , defect formation and deformation on the nano - scale level ( that of asperities in mems contacts ) . the first step in performing large scale molecular dynamics simulation of ru is to establish an appropriate interatomic potential .",
    "we have investigated several potentials for ru available from the literature , but encountered problems with each of sufficient magnitude to make them inappropriate for contact simulations . in this article , we develop a new embedded atom method  @xcite ( eam ) type potential for ru .",
    "we implement this potential in our molecular dynamics simulations of asperity contact and separation .",
    "the main focus of this paper is a comparison of how asperity contacts form and separate in gold and in ruthenium .",
    "in order to understand the formation and separation of nanoscale asperity contacts , we employ the molecular dynamics ( md ) technique  @xcite to simulate the accompanying atom - scale dynamics . in md , the motion of the atoms",
    "are simulated by solving newton s equations of motion for each atom in the simulation cell .",
    "the molecular dynamics were carried out at a constant pressure and temperature .",
    "this was done using the nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite and barostat  @xcite with a time step of @xmath0=0.0025  ps . in the contact experiments , we simulate two substrates , of roughly 15 close - packed planes , facing one another .",
    "these correspond to the ( 0001 ) planes of the ru hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) lattice and to ( 111 ) planes of the au face centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice . on one of the substrates we place an asperity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] .",
    "the top two layers in the upper substrate and the bottom two in the lower substrate were kept rigid in order to prevent the two substrates from rotating and to fix the relative displacement of the two substrates in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are enforced in the @xmath2 and @xmath3-directions .",
    "the simulation cell contains  35,000 atoms . in the present simulations ,",
    "an anisotropic isobaric ensemble is used at zero lateral pressure to maintain constant ( zero ) stress in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions .",
    "these boundary conditions were chosen to model a periodic surface while allowing the system to expand or contract in the @xmath2 and @xmath3-directions , as it would if the substrates were of finite extent in these directions .",
    "our first step in preparing the system is to construct a cube - shaped asperity with 8 close packed layers on the upper surface of the bottom substrate .",
    "second , we anneal the asperity by increasing the temperature from 3 k to 1700 k in 100 ps .",
    "next , we quench the system back to 3 k within 100 ps , and finally we increase the temperature to 600 k or 300k in 100 ps , for ru and au , respectively . the system is then quenched to the target temperature that may differ from the above values .",
    "this approach allows the asperity shape to evolve towards one that is relaxed away from its initial cubical shape .",
    "the resultant ru asperity at 300 k is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell ] .",
    "after the asperity annealing is completed , we displace the upper substrate toward the lower substrate at a constant velocity of 0.07 @xmath4 ( 7 m / s ) , while holding the lower substrate fixed ( i.e. , we hold the two atomic layers at the bottom of the lower substrate fixed ) . when the distance between the top of the upper substrate and the bottom of the lower substrate is 1.37 nm and 1.23 nm , for ru and au , respectively , the sign of the velocity of the upper substrate is reversed .",
    "the simulation continues until the upper and lower substrates are completely separated .",
    "the substrate velocity used here corresponds to that in a mems switch operating at @xmath5 ghz .",
    "the @xmath1-component of the force on the upper substrate is calculated during the simulation in order to determine the force - displacement relation for the contact simulation system .",
    "we investigate the formation of defects using the order parameter recently developed by  @xcite .",
    "the gold interatomic potential employed in the present study is an embedded atom method ( eam ) type potential developed by  @xcite .",
    "this potential provides a reasonable description of both bulk and surface phenomena and was used previously in contact simulation experiments .",
    "@xcite    we examined several potentials for ruthenium that were available in the literature . for the present simulations , we were looking for a potential that reproduces the elastic constants and cohesive energy of ru , and also gives stacking fault energy and surface energies that are in reasonable agreement with experiment . stacking fault energies play an important role in plastic deformation and",
    "surface energy determines the work of adhesion - both key elements in contact formation and separation phenomena .",
    "@xcite developed two different eam ( finnis - sinclair ) potentials for ru .",
    "the stacking fault energies were @xmath6= 13 @xmath7 $ ] in one version and @xmath6= 30.54 @xmath7 $ ] in the other .",
    "both of these differ significantly from the experimental value of @xmath6= 53.8 @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "hence , this potential is unsuitable for our contact simulations .",
    "while modified embedded atom method ( meam ) potentials  @xcite have significantly more flexibility , the meam potentials fail to produce a stable hcp crystal , as noted previously by  @xcite .",
    "we confirmed this via md simulations , which showed that application of a small strain destabilized the hexagonal close packed lattice of meam ru .",
    "@xcite developed an eam potential for ru , but did not include ( or calculate ) the surface and stacking fault energies .",

    "note that lattice constants , surface energy @xmath8 and basal stacking fault energy @xmath6 are in very good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "@xcite we obtained larger differences between our calculated values and experimental values of the other properties .",
    "in particular , we determine the melting point of this ru potential to be @xmath10 k , using the coexistence method .",
    "@xcite while this is low compared with the experimental value for ru @xmath11 k , this is not a problem since all simulations were performed at temperatures less than a quarter of the melting temperature . overall the potential is much better suited for contact simulations than previous potentials .",
    "furthermore , we performed a series of md simulations using this potential over a wide range of temperatures in order to insure that the hcp structure is stable at finite temperatures .",
    "these simulations were performed on a perfect crystal containing 4800 ru atoms and using periodic boundary conditions in all three directions , where the periodic lengths were free to adjust to insure zero stress in the system .",
    "the hcp structure was found to be stable from low temperature up to the melting point .",
    "figures  [ fig : rufd300 ] shows the force - displacement curves for the ru contact simulations at temperature t=300 k and t=600 k. the two force - displacement curves have many features in common .",
    "the zero of the displacement corresponds to the first contact between the top substrate and the asperity ; at large separation ( initially negative displacement ) , the force is zero .",
    "as the two substrates approach each other , the force becomes negative because of the short range attractive interactions between the atoms on the opposing substrate surfaces ( this is determined by the interaction range of the interatomic potentials ) .",
    "this attraction elastically stretches the two materials and there is a jump - to - contact .  @xcite",
    "as the displacement increases beyond this point , the material goes into compression .",
    "there is an approximately linear rise in the force with displacement , punctuated by a series of relatively sharp drops .",
    "the linear increase between the drops corresponds to elastic compression .",
    "the sharp drops correspond to defect generation or annihilation events ( see below ) . when the sign of the velocity changes , the system begins to unload from the compressed state .",
    "the unloading is initially characterized by linear elastic regions with a few jumps . eventually , the force reaches a minimum ( i.e. , a maximum tensile stress ) , following which the tensile stress slowly decreases to zero over a long displacement range . in this region , the overall force - displacement trend is also interrupted by sharp jumps .",
    "the two substrates separate at larger ( negative ) displacement than that at which the initial contact occurred ( i.e. , zero displacement ) .",
    "the magnitude of the displacement necessary to separate the two substrates is much larger in the high temperature simulation than for the low temperature one , suggesting that the material is much more ductile ( larger strain to failure ) at high temperature than at low temperature .",
    "this interpretation is easily confirmed by reference to the morphologies observed during deformation at @xmath12 k and @xmath13 k shown in fig .",

    "before we begin the examination of the atomic configuration and how it evolves during contact and contact separation , we first remind the reader of the hcp structure , as viewed in the projection employed in many of the images in the remainder of the paper . figure  [ fig : sc ] shows the hcp structure viewed along the @xmath14 $ ] direction ( i.e. , the @xmath15 plane ) .",
