    "a pulsar loses most of its rotational energy in a relativistic wind which , when confined , may be observable as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "pwn are our main diagnostics of the pulsar wind and its environment , but at radio wavelengths , just seven pulsars are known to have definite pwn .",
    "all these pulsars are young ( six are younger than 20000  kyr ) , have high spin - down luminosities ( @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 ) and are associated with supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "the obvious question to ask is whether there are radio pwn around other pulsars .",
    "however , finding such pwn presents an observational challenge , because the expected faint and/or compact sources might be masked by emission from their associated pulsars .",
    "the results of a systematic survey for radio pwn have been reported recently by frail & scharringhausen ( 1997 , hereafter fs97 ) .",
    "they used the very large array ( vla ) at 8.3  ghz and at 08 resolution , reasoning that this choice of observing parameters would allow them to best separate out any pwn from its associated pulsar .",
    "fs97 observed 35 pulsars , quite sensibly choosing pulsars with a high @xmath2 or space velocity .",
    "however , they failed to detect any pwn down to a 5@xmath3 sensitivity of 0.2  mjy  beam@xmath1 .",
    "fs97 concluded that only young energetic pulsars produce observable radio pwn , but could not rule out that they had simply resolved out any nebular emission .",
    "the results of fs97 have prompted us to search for pwn at southern declinations using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "rather than just image the pulsar and surrounds , we have used the technique of _ pulsar gating _ , in which data are recorded at high time resolution so that images can be made in which the pulsar has been `` switched off '' ( see figure  [ fig_1055_on_off ] ) .",
    "we observed five pulsars , at significantly lower frequency ( 1.3  ghz ) and resolution ( @xmath4 ) than did fs97 . because we can gate out the pulsar , our choice of observing parameters results in a surface brightness sensitivity _ 200 times fainter _  than that achieved by fs97 .",
    "of the five pulsars we observed with the atca , we were successful in finding a pwn associated with psr  b090649 , but saw no nebular emission towards psrs b104658 , b105552 , j11056107 or b161050 .",
    "results on psr  b090649 have been reported by gaensler et al ( 1998 ) , while the other pulsars will be discussed fully by stappers et al ( 1998 ) . here",
    "we review some of the highlights of this study .      with a characteristic age of just 7.4  kyr , and a high @xmath2 of @xmath5  erg  s@xmath1 ,",
    "psr  b161050 is a prime candidate for powering a radio pwn .",
    "however a gated image shows no pwn down to a 5@xmath3 limit of 1  mjy  beam@xmath1 .",
    "psr  b161050 is similar in its age , magnetic field strength and @xmath2 to psrs  b175724 and b1853 + 01 , both of which generate prominent pwn with bow - shock morphologies .",
    "a bow - shock pwn is confined by the ram pressure , @xmath6 , resulting from the relative motion of the pulsar with respect to the ism .",
    "the lack of a pwn associated with b161050 suggests that @xmath6 in this case is much less than for psrs  b175724 and b1853 + 01 , and we thus infer for b161050 a space - velocity @xmath7  , where @xmath8  @xmath9 is the ambient density .",
    "an association between psr  b161050 and the nearby snr kes  32 has been claimed by caraveo ( 1993 ) , but implies a projected velocity for the pulsar @xmath103600  .",
    "this can only be reconciled with our result if @xmath11  @xmath9 , in which case kes  32 itself should not be visible .",
    "furthermore , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig_1610_field ] the region is a complex one , containing three spiral arms , at least three snrs and eight known pulsars .",
    "thus spatial proximity alone is hardly compelling evidence for a pulsar / snr association .",
    "finally , if psr  b161050 indeed has this high inferred space velocity , then one might expect significant distortion of kes  32 where it was penetrated by the pulsar ( as is seen in the case of g5.41.2 and psr  b175724 ) .",
    "however the appropriate part of the shell shows no such effect . from all these results ,",
    "we can conclude that psr  b161050 is _ not _  associated with snr  kes  32 , nor with any other known remnant .",
    "the lack of an associated snr for such a young pulsar implies an ambient density @xmath12  @xmath9 ( e.g.kafatos et al 1980 ) , which is consistent with the lack of a radio pwn for typical pulsar space velocities .",
    "psr  b105552 is a comparatively old pulsar ( @xmath13  kyr ) with a moderate spin - down luminosity ( @xmath14  erg  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "an extended radio pwn was reported by combi et al ( 1997 ) using observations with a 30  m single dish , while in hard x - rays an extended clumpy pwn is seen by _ asca _",
    "( shibata et al 1997 ) .",
    "our gated atca data show no radio pwn associated with psr  b105552 on any spatial scale ( see figures  [ fig_1055_on_off ] and [ fig_1055_asca_atca ] ) .",
    "our observations certainly have the sensitivity and @xmath15 coverage to detect the radio nebula of combi et al ( 1997 ) , and we conclude that the source they claim as a pwn is clearly spurious and is a result of confusion , typical when small single dishes are pointed at complex regions .    in figure  [ fig_1055_asca_atca ]",
    "we show an overlay between radio and x - ray images of the region .",
    "the clumps of x - ray emission , claimed by shibata et al ( 1997 ) to be part of an extended pwn , coincide with radio point sources , and also correspond to x - ray point sources in _ rosat _  data ( w. becker , these proceedings ) .",
    "thus we think it more likely that the apparent x - ray pwn corresponds to emission from unrelated background sources .",
    "psr  b090649 is a relatively young ( @xmath16  kyr ) and energetic ( @xmath17  erg  s@xmath1 ) pulsar .",
    "gated atca observations result in the image shown in figure  [ fig_0906 ] , in which an off - pulse source can be seen at the position of the pulsar .",
    "this source is extended and has no detectable polarisation , and we conclude that it is best interpreted as a bow - shock pwn associated with psr  b090649 .",
    "a possible trail extends behind the pwn , with an axis of symmetry which aligns with the direction along which the pwn is extended .    using a projected space velocity for b090649 of @xmath1860  ( johnston et al 1998 ) ,",
    "pressure balance arguments can be used to infer an ambient density @xmath19  @xmath9 .",
    "thus the ram pressure which confines this pwn results mainly from the high ambient density , rather than from the pulsar velocity .",
    "psr  b090649 is the oldest pulsar yet to be associated with a radio pwn ; it is also worth noting that this pwn is 100 times fainter than could have been detected by fs97 .",
    "pulsar - gating with the atca has allowed us to carry out a deep search for radio pwn around five pulsars .",
    "no pwn was found for psrs b104658 , b105552 , b11056107 or b161050 . from these results",
    ", we argue that psr  b161050 is not associated with snr  kes  32 , and also conclude that there is no evidence to support previous claims of radio and x - ray nebulae associated with psr  b105552 .",
    "we successfully detected a faint pwn around psr  b090649 .",
    "this pwn seems quite different from other bow - shock pwn , in that it is associated with a low velocity pulsar in a dense medium .",
    "our results bear out the expectation that only pulsars with a high @xmath2 will produce radio pwn .",
    "data on known pwn suggest that a minimum ram pressure @xmath20  ( ) @xmath21  @xmath9 is required to confine the wind sufficiently to produce observable radio emission .",
    "our small survey clearly demonstrates that there are severe selection effects associated with previous searches for radio pwn .",
    "there may well be an undiscovered population of faint pwn similar to that found around psr  b090649 , and we intend to follow up on this possibility by using pulsar - gating on the vla to observe a large number of sources .",
    "apart from finding new and interesting pwn , we hope to use the results of such a survey to properly constrain the minimum @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath22 required to produce a radio pwn .",
    "bmg is grateful to the local organising committee , the science foundation for physics within the university of sydney , the r.  and m.  bentwich scholarship and the james kentley memorial scholarship for financial assistance in attending this workshop .",
    "the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro ."
