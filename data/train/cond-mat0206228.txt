    "the ability to produce large , unexpected changes represents one of the most remarkable dynamical features of complex systems @xcite .",
    "examples include crashes in financial markets , jams in traffic and data networks , and the collapse of the immune system in humans .",
    "the large changes arising in real - world systems might be exogenous and hence triggered by some event in the environment which is external to the system - however the most intriguing case concerns the _ endogenous _ large changes which seem to arise ` out of nowhere ' and can not be blamed on any particular external cause .",
    "the bursting of the dot - com bubble around april 2000 represents a recent finance - related example of an endogenous large change .",
    "the practical motivation for studying large changes or so - called ` extreme events ' is obvious : they are rare , but the damage they cause can be catastrophic .",
    "present practice in assessing the risk of such events is purely statistical @xcite .",
    "this has two shortcomings .",
    "first , these events are rare and hence reliable statistics are difficult to determine .",
    "second , large events such as crashes arise from subtle temporal correlations in the time - series and hence can last over many time - steps . such changes are therefore not easily captured by examining probability distribution functions involving a fixed number of time - steps  @xcite .",
    "the academic motivation is equally strong , since large changes provide a visible demonstration of the system s internal dynamics and correlations .",
    "reference  @xcite quotes bacon from novum organum : `` whoever knows the ways of nature will more easily notice her deviations ; and , on the other hand , whoever knows her deviations will more accurately describe her ways '' . in short , the largest changes will tend to ` scrape the barrel ' in some way : hence they may provide new insight into the structure of the barrel ( i.e. the system ) and contents ( i.e. the constituent parts and their interactions ) .    in this paper , we examine large changes using a simple , yet highly non - trivial , model for a complex system comprising a population of objects or ` agents ' repeatedly competing for a limited global resource . in particular , we study the many possible paths the multi - agent system may take in the vicinity of a possible large change .",
    "this ` many - worlds ' view allows us not only to predict the start and end of a large change in this system , but also to investigate how such a large change might be avoided .",
    "we find that the system can be ` immunized ' : by provoking a small response today , the future robustness of the system against large changes can be boosted .",
    "agent - based models are becoming a standard tool for investigating complex system behavior across many disciplines@xcite .",
    "typically each agent has access to a limited set of recent global outcomes of the system ; she then combines this information with her limited strategy set , chosen randomly at the start of the game ( i.e. quenched disorder ) in order to decide an action at the given timestep .",
    "these decisions by the @xmath3 agents feed back to generate the system s output .",
    "the minority game ( mg ) introduced by challet and zhang@xcite offers possibly the simplest paradigm for such a complex , adaptive system and has therefore been the subject of much research activity @xcite .",
    "most studies of the mg have focused on a calculation of both time and configuration ( i.e. quenched disorder ) averaged quantities - in particular the ` volatility ' @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the standard deviation of the number of agents taking a given decision .",
    "our previous work has shown that the variation of this averaged @xmath5 as a function of memory size @xmath6 can be quantitatively explained in terms of ` crowd - anticrowd ' collective behavior @xcite . in common with other mg theories @xcite ,",
    "our crowd - anticrowd theory implicitly assumes both time - averaging and configuration - averaging .",
    "the approach of studying realization - averaged quantities is standard in physics .",
    "it yields meaningful results for a wide range of physical systems because of the natural self - averaging which occurs in many - particle systems over the time - scales and length - scales of a typical experiment .",
    "however it is arguably of limited use in the study of real - world complex systems .",
    "this is because the observed evolution of a complex system only provides a _ single _ realization of the many possible paths that the dynamics can take . a financial market , for example",
    ", evolves with the knowledge that a crash happened at a specific moment in the past : there is a definite pre- and post - crash dynamics which will tend to condition the possible future paths .",
    "for example , the future behavior of the financial markets is dictated in part by the spectre of the recent dot - com boom and bust . in the context of human evolution ,",
    "social revolutions dominate the subsequent dynamics within a society .",
    "consequently one would gain little insight into the present state of the world by including all possible scenarios from the past , such as ones where the dinosaurs did not become extinct or ones where us did not gain independence . with this in mind , we have recently introduced two alternative theoretical approaches to analyse the mg , both of which focus on the dynamics for a _ single _ realization of the quenched disorder . the first approach @xcite views the mg as a stochastically perturbed deterministic system .",
    "averaging over the sources of stochasticity , in particular the coin - tosses used to break ties in strategy scores , yields a set of deterministic mapping equations @xcite . hence , in this system any particular realization of the quenched disorder will give rise to a single path for the future dynamics . the second approach takes a complementary , stochastic viewpoint based on a markov chain analysis @xcite .",
    "it is this latter theoretical approach which we will build upon in the present paper , focusing on the effect that the stochasticity can have in creating alternative future paths in the system s evolution .",
    "a further distinguishing feature of the present work is therefore its ` many worlds ' view of the future evolution of a multi - agent system .",
    "the underlying motivation for such an approach is our desire to understand the degree to which information about an upcoming large change is already ` encoded ' in the system , and hence the degree to which the large change itself might be avoidable .",
    "the basic mg @xcite comprises an odd number of agents @xmath7 ( e.g. traders or drivers ) choosing repeatedly between option 0 ( e.g. sell or choose route 0 ) and option 1 ( e.g. buy or choose route 1 ) .",
    "the winners are those in the minority group ; e.g. sellers win if there is an excess of buyers , drivers choosing route 0 encounter less traffic if most other drivers choose route 1 .",
    "the outcome at each timestep represents the winning decision , 0 or 1 .",
    "a common bit - string of the @xmath6 most recent outcomes is made available to the agents at each timestep @xcite .",
    "the agents randomly pick @xmath8 strategies at the beginning of the game , with repetitions allowed .",
    "this initial strategy allocation represents a quenched disorder .",
    "each strategy is a bit - string of length @xmath9 which predicts the next outcome for each of the @xmath9 possible histories . after each turn",
    ", the agent assigns one ( virtual ) point to each strategy which would have predicted the correct outcome . at each turn of the game",
    ", the agent uses the most successful strategy , i.e. the one with the most virtual points , among her @xmath8 strategies .",
    "any ties between equally successful strategies are resolved by the toss of a coin .",
    "our grand canonical minority game ( gcmg ) was first presented in ref .",
    "the main generalizations from the basic mg are as follows : ( i ) an agent only participates if she possesses a strategy that has a score equal to , or greater than , a predefined threshold @xmath10 , and ( ii ) the strategy performance is only recorded over the previous @xmath11 timesteps .",
    "the gcmg hence incorporates the following real - world effects : ( i ) agents ( e.g. traders ) only participate if they have a certain level of confidence in the strategies that they possess , and ( ii ) the agents will tend to forget ( or consider irrelevant ) results that lie too far back in history .",
    "these seemingly trivial modifications of the basic mg yield a dynamical system with surprisingly rich dynamics .",
    "these dynamics depend strongly on whether the participants are fed real ( as opposed to random ) history strings , and on the nature of the quenched disorder corresponding to the initial conditions .",
    "we focus on the low @xmath6 regime because of the richer dynamics , however our formalism can be applied for all @xmath6 .",
    "the number of agents holding a particular combination of strategies can be written as a @xmath12 ( @xmath8 terms ) dimensional tensor @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the total number of available strategies . for @xmath15 strategies per agent ,",
    "this is simply a @xmath16 matrix where the entry @xmath17 represents the number of agents who picked strategy @xmath18 and then @xmath19 .",
    "the strategy labels are given by the decimal representation of the strategy plus unity , for example the strategy 0101 for @xmath20 has strategy label 5 + 1=6 .",
    "this quenched disorder @xmath21 is fixed at the beginning of the game and is written using the full strategy space @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath22 describes the prediction of strategy @xmath23 given the history @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the decimal number corresponding to the @xmath6-bit binary history string @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath26 denotes a prediction of option ` 0 ' while @xmath27 denotes a prediction of option ` 1 ' .    as discussed in sec .",
    "i , we are interested in the detailed dynamics of the game for a given realization of the initial quenched disorder @xmath21 .",
    "hence we imagine that a particular @xmath21 has already been chosen .",
    "since the game involves a coin - toss to break ties in strategy scores , this stochasticity also means that different runs for a given @xmath21 will also differ - we return to this point below . the number of traders making decision @xmath28 ( the ` instantaneous crowd ' ) minus the number of traders making decision @xmath29 ( the ` instantaneous anticrowd ' ) defines the net ` attendance ' @xmath30 $ ] at a given timestep @xmath31 of the game .",
    "this attendance @xmath32 $ ] is made up of two groups of traders at any one timestep @xcite :    \\(a ) @xmath33 $ ] traders who act in a ` decided ' way , i.e. they do not require the toss of a coin to decide which option to choose .",
    "this is because they have one strategy that is better than their other playable strategies , or because their highest - scoring strategies are tied _ but _ give the same response as each other to the history @xmath34 at that turn of the game .",
    "\\(b ) @xmath35 $ ] traders who act in an ` undecided ' way , i.e. they require the toss of a coin to decide which option to choose .",
    "this is because they have two ( or more ) tied , highest - scoring strategies _ and _ these give different responses to the history @xmath34 at that turn of the game .",
    "hence the attendance at timestep @xmath31 is given by @xmath36=a_{d}[t]+a_{u}[t]\\ \\ \\ .\\ ] ] the state of the game at the beginning of timestep @xmath31 depends on the strategy score vector @xmath37  and history @xmath34 .",
    "henceforth we will drop the variable @xmath31 from the notation , but note that it remains an implicit variable through the time - dependence of @xmath38 and @xmath25 .",
    "we also focus on @xmath15 strategies per agent , although the formalism can be generalized in a straightforward way . at timestep @xmath31 , @xmath39 is given exactly by @xmath40)\\mathrm{h}[s_{r}-r]\\underline{\\underline{\\psi } } % _ { r , r^{^{\\prime } } } \\ ] ] where the symmetrized matrix @xmath41 with @xmath42 representing the quenched disorder .",

    "having obtained @xmath53and @xmath54 , it is now possible to calculate the probability @xmath55 that the next winning decision is a 0 , given knowledge of @xmath38  and @xmath25 .",
    "this probability is given as follows : @xmath56)\\ ] ] we note that eqs .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) represent a generalization to the gcmg , of the equations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the basic mg within the markov chain formalism .",
    "the dynamics of the gcmg are rich , and exhibit large changes @xcite . here",
    "we look in detail at a typical ( randomly - chosen ) large change . in particular",
    "we are going to look at the many paths along which the system can evolve , starting well before the large change itself .",
    "the quenched disorder is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "the exact numerical form of @xmath57 is too cumbersome to show but can be obtained from the authors .",
    "the initial conditions are defined by the score vector @xmath38  and the corresponding history state @xmath25 . for the purpose of calculating the values of @xmath38 and @xmath25  in subsequent timesteps",
    ", we also define the last @xmath58  winning outcomes of the gcmg .",
    "the specific initial conditions employed were taken from a typical run of the game , once initial transients had disappeared .",
    "equation ( 5 )  states the probability that the next winning outcome is a 0 , given knowledge of @xmath38  and @xmath25 .",
    "it is possible to go further than this , by stating the mean attendance given that the attendance is positive ( i.e. winning decision of 0 ) and/or the mean attendance given that the attendance is negative ( i.e. winning decision of 1 ) .",
    "note that given astate of @xmath38  and @xmath25 , @xmath55 may be greater than 0 but less than 1 , and as such both winning decisions are possible for this state .",
    "if however @xmath55 has a value of 0 or 1 , then there is only one winning decision via which the complex system may evolve at that time - step .",
    "the system is therefore deterministic at this time - step .",
    "there are several scenarios for @xmath59  and @xmath46  that can be examined .",
    "if @xmath60 and @xmath61  then the price change is given by the value of @xmath59 , hence only one winning outcome is possible . if @xmath62 and @xmath63 , then the winning outcome has equal probability of being 0 or 1 . in this case",
    "the recorded attendance is zero : however the two possible winning outcomes are noted for the purpose of calculating the outcomes for subsequent timesteps . if @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then the attendance @xmath66 can take @xmath67 possible values , each with their associated probabilities calculated using simple binomial theory in a similar way to eq .",
    "the magnitude of the attendance at @xmath68 has no significance for the future states of the system at times @xmath69 .",
    "only information concerning the sign of the attendance is carried forward , via the winning outcome .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to record the attendance for that timestep as being the average possible value , i.e. @xmath70 if @xmath71 and @xmath65 .",
    "showing all @xmath67 possible price changes will not provide us with any extra useful information concerning the system - instead , showing the average value will enable us to present a less cluttered image of the many worlds ( see later ) . if @xmath64 and @xmath72 , then both winning outcomes 0 and 1 are possible .",
    "for ease of calculation we shall approximate the binomial distribution in @xmath48 using a normal distribution .",
    "hence we can extract two possible values for the attendance : one corresponding to a winning outcome of 0 , and the other a winning outcome of 1 . to calculate these attendances ,",
    "one should split the normal distribution into two parts with the dividing line at the point of cut - off in terms of determining the winning outcome .",
    "if the winning outcome is to be a 0 , then the corresponding attendance contributed by @xmath46 becomes the first moment of the distribution above the cut - off .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of this scenario , and indicates the two corresponding attendances that are to be calculated .",
    "we  define a ` path ' as the trajectory of the complex system during one possible run of the game .",
    "the game is set up with @xmath73 agents , each with two @xmath74 strategies scored over the last @xmath75 timesteps .",
    "the agents have identical confidence levels given by @xmath76 .",
    "figure 2a shows all 949 different paths in terms of the cumulative attendance ( e.g. price in a financial market ) . that this complex system can take over 56 timesteps , starting from the given initial conditions .",
    "figure 2b indicates the probabilities of occurrence of the paths in one run of the game , as a function of the paths end points .",
    "figure 2c shows a measure of the spread in price - increment between all the different paths as a function of time .",
    "this measure of the spread in price - increment is defined as follows : @xmath77 p(x_{i})\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the price change between neighboring timesteps for a price path denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "the probability that path @xmath78occurs , given the initial conditions , is given by @xmath80 .",
    "we note that for the basic mg , @xmath81  would take a value of @xmath82 if the attendances were random . in the present gcmg case ,",
    "the random limit would be larger due to the fluctuation in the total number of agents playing at a given time - step .",
    "it becomes very difficult to resolve the different paths in fig .",
    "2a after timestep 40 , even though it is only the average , historically - distinct paths which have been shown .",
    "the thick line shows the weighted average of _ all _ these paths .",
    "[ equation ( 5 ) allows us to calculate the probability of each path being the actual path taken in a single run of the game ] .",
    "it is easy to identify by eye that a large change ( i.e. so - called drawdown or crash ) occurs between time - steps 33 and 50 .",
    "figure 2c shows that @xmath81  takes a very small value at the start of the crash : this signifies that the price - changes are similar at this point in time , in terms of the direction and size of movement , for the large majority of separate paths .",
    "similarly at the end of the crash the quantity @xmath81 takes a very large value , signifying a point in time where there is great disparity in the sign and size of price - changes between separate paths .",
    "we note that @xmath81  is zero for the first 12 steps , since there is only one path possible up until timestep 13 .",
    "figure 2c demonstrates that it is possible to identify the start of a crash ahead of time , by the collective movements of the ` parallel worlds ' . in the case",
    "shown , the start of the crash is indicated by the collective crashes of the large majority of the many parallel worlds . furthermore , it is possible in this system to identify the point in time when the system is released from the crash by observing when there is significant disparity between the parallel - world path movements . starting from a time 33 steps prior to the start of the crash , it can be seen that a crash is highly likely .    despite being highly likely ,",
    "such a crash is not however inevitable . in order to gain insight into how the crash may be managed , reduced or even avoided",
    ", we now turn to investigate the differences between the paths which perform better / worse than the many - world average .",
    "we will take ` better than ' as being a path that has an end value that is numerically greater than that of the mean at timestep 56 ( c.f .",
    "2a ) - similarly for ` worse than ' .",
    "hence we shall split up the paths into these two corresponding groups : better - than - the - mean shall be labelled set a , and worse - than - the - mean shall be labelled set b.    figure 3a shows the probability tree of a path belonging to set a , for the first 33 timesteps . each branching in this figure corresponds to a branching in fig .",
    "2a . measuring the cumulative sign of attendance ( i.e. price in a financial market ) at timestep 33 ,",
    "one gets three values for the particular initial conditions : @xmath29 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "it is interesting to segregate those paths that have a cumulative movement of @xmath29 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , and plot the equivalent graphs to those shown in fig .",
    "3a together with their weighted means .",
    "figure 3b shows those paths with a net movement of @xmath29 .",
    "figure 3c shows those paths with a net movement of @xmath83 .",
    "figure 3d shows those with a net movement of @xmath84 .",
    "the mean probability of ending up as a member of set a is _ greater _ for those paths with a net movement of @xmath83 as compared to those with @xmath84 . similarly , the mean probability of ending up as a member of set a is _ greater _ for those paths with a net movement of @xmath29 as compared to those with @xmath83 .",
    "we next compare weighted histograms of the cumulative _ sign _ of attendance during a period prior to the crash , and during a period after the crash .",
    "this will reinforce our findings concerning the differences between the paths in set a and set b. to do this , we set the period prior to the crash as timesteps 11 to 35 , and the period after the crash as timesteps 36 to 56 .",
    "figure 4a shows the histogram for set a prior to the crash .",
    "figure 4b shows the histogram for set b prior to the crash .",
    "it can be seen that the paths in set b generally have _ greater _ cumulative signs of attendance than the paths in set a. figure 4c shows the histogram for set a after the crash , while fig .",
    "4d shows the histogram for set b also after the crash .",
    "now the paths in set b generally have _ smaller _ cumulative signs of attendance than the paths in set a.    we now examine the occurrence of ( m+1)-bit words contained in the sequence of winning outcomes during the period from timestep 11 to 35 , for the paths in set a and set b. [ studying the occurrence of ( m+1)-bit words is equivalent to studying the occurrence of a 0 or a 1 following an m - bit history ] .",
    "figure 5 shows the frequency of occurrence of an ( m+1)-bit word for set a , divided by that for set b. this indicates how much more likely a particular ( m+1)-bit word is in set a as compared to set b , prior to the crash .",
    "hence it is just over twice as likely that 000 will be followed by a 0 in a path belonging to set a , as compared to a path belonging to set b. the period preceding the crash can therefore be seen as one of ` imbalance ' or ` tension ' , which is subsequently released by the crash .",
    "figure 6 shows an @xmath74 de - bruijn graph @xcite .",
    "the edges represent transitions between history states .",
    "transitions having peak values above @xmath85 in fig . 5 , are shown with darker arrows .",
    "transitions that are particularly weak are represented by dashed arrows .",
    "the paths which are members of set a , i.e. those which perform _ better _ than the mean , tend to have more _ down _ movements in their history prior to the crash .",
    "by contrast , those paths which are members of set b , i.e. those which perform _ worse _ than the mean , tend to have more _ up _ movements in their history prior to the crash .",
    "if one therefore wanted to avoid the crash in a run of the game , then it would be wise to force the system to undergo _ down _ movements prior to the crash , so as to relax the build up of any unwanted bias in the strategy scores .",
    "this would then keep the system to the left - hand side of the de - bruijn graph where the arrows are darker , as seen in figure 6 .",
    "a controlling force or ` complex systems manager ' could intervene at moments where there is little cost in order to manipulate a winning outcome , i.e. at time - steps where it may require as little as one agent to change the path of the system . in this way",
    "the controlling force could avoid the crash with minimal effort or investment .",
    "this result that a large change can be prevented by creating an earlier , smaller movement _ in the same direction _ , reminds us of the idea of ` immunization ' .",
    "injecting a small amount of a virus provokes a minor response which ` primes ' the system s defences against a much larger , and potentially fatal , response later on . in the same way ,",
    "a small crash induced today , can be used to prevent a much larger crash from arising later on .",
    "it has recently been shown that the large endogenous changes which arise in the gcmg complex system , exhibit a degree of predictability @xcite .",
    "information signaling an increased threat of a large change is ` encoded ' in the system s microstructure well in advance .",
    "the present results for the gcmg are therefore consistent with these earlier findings @xcite . in real - world complex systems",
    ", such encoding would clearly be far more complicated to unravel .",
    "however there is the hope that _ if _ the system is viewed with the right ` spectacles ' , such signals might be uncovered .",
    "we refer the reader to the large body of work of sornette et al .",
    "( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) for the fascinating proposal of a log - periodic signature prior to large changes in a range of physical and natural systems , including financial markets .",
    "finally , we would like to draw attention to the nature of the large change studied in this paper .",
    "this event is described by a convergence of the many ` world lines ' which project into the immediate future .",
    "this convergence arises in spite of the stochastic fluctuations which occur along each ` world line ' .",
    "it is this effect that gives the system its predictability , and enables us to identify the birth of the crash .",
    "we note that if an observer was limited to knowledge of just a single ` world line ' , then little could be said about the crash s appearance until it became completely obvious .",
    "irrespective of the fact that a crash arose , there is arguably a more fundamental ` event ' which occurred in the system s dynamics .",
    "this ` event ' is the seemingly spontaneous convergence of the diversity of world - lines into the same direction .",
    "this convergence underlies the robustness of the resulting large change and hence the inevitability of the crash - in short the crash happened because of ` fate ' as opposed to chance .",
    "this leads us to speculate that an ` event ' in which a wide range of world - lines converge , may be fairly universal in complex systems , and nature in general . in short",
    ", the reality that is observed in the physical world might correspond to robust ` events ' involving convergence of world - lines , and as such is relatively unaffected by external noise / fluctuations .",
    "we have investigated large changes in the grand canonical minority game ( gcmg ) .",
    "the gcmg provides a simple , yet highly non - trivial , model for a complex system comprising a population of objects or ` agents ' repeatedly competing for a limited global resource .",
    "we have focused on the many possible paths the multi - agent system may take in the vicinity of a possible large change .",
    "this ` many - worlds ' view allowed us not only to predict the start and end of a large change , but also to investigate how such a large change might be avoided .",
    "we uncover the remarkable result that the complex system can be ` immunized ' in order to protect it against large changes .",
    "in particular we find that by provoking a small response today in the system , we can protect it against much larger responses in the future .",
