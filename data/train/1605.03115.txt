    "the production and the culture of microalgae play a growing industrial and commercial role ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , and the references therein ) .",
    "their relationship with renewable energy and sustainable development should also be emphasized ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding cultivation systems , which are called _ photobioreactors _ , or _ pbr _ , give rise to challenging control questions which have already attracted a lot of attention .",
    "most of the existing academic publications are model - based ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite@xcite ) . among the various control techniques , which are often nonlinear , optimal control @xcite , predictive control ( @xcite ) , adaptive control ( @xcite ) , feedback linearization ( @xcite ) , and the use of partial differential equations @xcite are perhaps the most popular ones .",
    "although those papers are quite promising , they suffer from the great difficulty of deriving a `` good '' mathematical modeling of the bioprocess ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "it is due to    1 .",
    "its inherent complexity , 2 .",
    "its uncertain and time - varying characteristics since a life process has to be taken into account .",
    "this communication is introducing therefore a new _ model - free control _ setting @xcite , which is moreover rather easy to implement both from software @xcite and hardware @xcite standpoints .",
    "there are many concrete applications , including some patents .",
    "we select here for obvious reasons publications that are related to biotechnology : @xcite@xcite .",
    "the performances of this approach are compared to those achieved by an input - output ( i / o ) feedback linearization , which is among the most widely used control design in the academic literature on bioreactors @xcite .",
    "the cultivation of the microalgae _ chlamydomonas reinhardtii _ is considered here . the biomass concentration will be regulated to a target value , determined so that a high level of biomass productivity is achieved .",
    "the influence of light fluctuation on the reference tracking is also taken into account .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system and its modeling are presented in section [ sect.model ] .",
    "section [ sect.control ] displays two control strategies : an i / o feedback linearizing control and a model - free one .",
    "these strategies include two steps : ( i ) the choice of the setpoint that leads to a high biomass productivity , ( ii ) the regulation of the system around this setpoint .",
    "numerical results are provided and discussed in section [ sect.simulation ] .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are developed in section [ sect.conclusion ] .",
    "in the continuous operation of pbr , the reactor is continuously fed with the liquid medium culture with nutrients ; the rate of outflow is equal to the rate of inflow ( @xmath0 ) and the culture volume ( @xmath1 ) remains constant .",
    "the manipulated variable in this case is the dilution rate ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the microorganism population grows in the medium consuming nutrients ( dissolved co@xmath3 , nitrogen , phosphorus ) . in autotrophic conditions ,",
    "the solely carbon source is co@xmath3 , which is provided continuously by air enriched co@xmath3 bubbled in the liquid medium ; its injection depends on the ph , which is maintained at the growth optimum value @xcite . by this way ,",
    "all liquid nutrients are provided in sufficient quantities for avoiding mineral limitations .",
    "the main factor governing the growth is the light which is the energy source for the growth .",
    "pbr surface is lighted artificially or naturally . for a given pbr geometry , light intensity distribution in the cultivation medium",
    "depends on biomass concentration as well as on optical properties of the microalgae , which are determined by their shape and pigment content . in continuous , mineral nonlimiting cultivation conditions , the only limiting factor is the photon flux density received by the culture . improving the light availability is thus a crucial aspect of biomass growth and process productivity .",
    "a low amount of light would decrease the growth .",
    "this is due to lack of energy necessary to fixate carbone .",
    "excessive irradiance on the other hand would induce inhibition phenomena .",
    "dynamic models describing the behavior of microalgae cultures are usually a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "they are mainly deduced from mass balance considerations on both liquid and gaseous phases @xcite . in an `` optimal '' system ensuring nonlimiting conditions with respect to the liquid nutrients and environmental conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , temperature and ph , the rate of photosynthesis and productivity are determined by the light availability @xcite . in this case , the model is represented by one differential equation expressing biomass concentration dynamics , coupled with algebraic equations giving light profile into the culture bulk ( radiative model ) and kinetic law yielding local photosynthetic responses by expressing growth rate as a function of local irradiance in the bulk depth .",
    "different kinetic models are presented in the literature @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "a predictive model from @xcite has been used as benchmark for our controllers .",
    "the mass balance model of a continuous well - stirred pbr for biomass concentration @xmath4 , in kg / m@xmath5 , is as follows :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the growth rate ( kg / m@xmath5/h ) and @xmath8 the dilution rate ( h@xmath9 ) .",
    "the kinetic model proposed by @xcite predicts photosynthesis and respiration of microalgae from an energetic analysis .    the biomass growth rate @xmath7 is stoichiometrically linked to the net oxygen evolution rate @xmath10 :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the c - molar mass for the biomass ( g mol@xmath9 ) and @xmath13 the stoichiometric coefficient .",
    "@xmath10 is calculated with : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total reactor depth , @xmath16 is the depth of the reactor in rectangular coordinates ( since the pbr here is rectangular .",
    "the pbr considered here was presented in detail in @xcite ) , and @xmath17 represents the local specific rate of o@xmath3 production and consumption in the reactor depth ( in mol@xmath18/kg@xmath19/h ) .",
    "it is the result of photosynthetic production and respiration consumption , on which evolution depends on the local irradiance : @xmath20 where    * @xmath21 is the local irradiance , * @xmath22 is the maximum value of the energetic yield , * @xmath23 is the mass absorption coefficient , linked to the pigment content , * @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are stoichiometric yield expressed from the stochiometric equation of biomass synthesis , * @xmath27 is the half saturation constant of photosynthesis , describing photosynthesis saturation with increasing light , * @xmath28 is the respiration inhibition constant , describing the decrease of respiration in light .",
    "most of the model parameters are constant , except @xmath27 and @xmath28 for which independent oxygen or fluorescence measurements are used for proposing values , which are strain dependent .",
    "the two - flux model can then be used to model the irradiance @xmath21 and the following formulation of irradiance distribution can be employed @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the two - flux extinction coefficient , and @xmath31 the linear scattering modulus .",
    "@xmath32 is the backward scattering fraction ( dimensionless ) .",
    "@xmath33 , the mass scattering coefficients ( m@xmath34 kg@xmath9 ) , and @xmath23 are chosen as a function of @xmath35 , the incident light intensity .",
    "these optical properties are strain dependent and vary with growth conditions .",
    "empirical formulae deduced from experiments in a wide range of incident light conditions @xcite have been used here ( see table [ tab.modelecomplet ] ) .",
    ".model parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        for simplicity s sake , let us restrict ourselves to siso systems .",
    "the unknown global description of the plant is replaced by the _ ultra - local model _ : @xmath36 where :    * the control and output variables are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , * the derivation order of @xmath38 is @xmath39 like in most concrete situations , * @xmath40 is chosen by the practitioner such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are of the same magnitude",
    ".    the following comments might be useful :    * equation is only valid during a short time lapse . it must be continuously updated , *",
    "@xmath43 is estimated via the knowledge of the control and output variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 , * @xmath43 subsumes not only the unknown structure of the system , which most of the time will be nonlinear , but also of any disturbance .",

    "ip_,@xmath44 where :    * @xmath45 is the tracking error , * @xmath46 is a usual tuning gain .    combining and yields : @xmath47 where @xmath43 does not appear anymore .",
    "the tuning of @xmath46 is therefore quite straightforward .",
    "this is a major benefit when compared to the tuning of `` classic '' pids ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , and the references therein )",
    ". some more comments may be useful :    * see @xcite for a connection with stability margins . * equations and render pointless any formal checking of the closed - loop system behavior ( compare , _",
    "e.g. _ , with @xcite ) .",

    "rewrite by using the well - known notations from operational calculus : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a constant .",
    "we get rid of the initial condition @xmath51 by multiplying both sides on the left by @xmath52 : @xmath53 noise attenuation is achieved by multiplying both sides on the left by @xmath54 .",
    "it yields in the time domain the realtime estimate , thanks to the equivalence between @xmath52 and the multiplication by @xmath55 , @xmath56 where @xmath57 might be quite small .",
    "this integral , which is a low pass filter , may of course be replaced in practice by a classic digital filter .",
    "close the loop with the ip .",

    "first , the two control laws are compared in the case of a piecewise - constant light intensity with the following profile : @xmath59 > from and fig . [ fig.setpoints ] , the biomass concentration reference value is deduced .",
    "it is piecewise constant : it varies from 0.17 to 0.38 kg / m@xmath5 at time @xmath60 hours .",
    "the biomass concentration at initial time is @xmath4(0)=0.17 kg / m@xmath5 , and the simulation duration is set to @xmath61 hours .",
    "the output is assumed to be measured with a sampling time @xmath62 min and to be corrupted by an additive zero - mean white gaussian noise with a standard deviation of about @xmath39% .",
    "the model - is used for the plant , whereas the simplified model - is considered for the model - based controller .",
    "the tuning parameters of the control law are as follows : @xmath63 for the model - based law and @xmath64 for the model - free one .",
    "the control laws are implemented using a zero - order hold .",
    "the control input @xmath8 satisfies the constraints @xmath65 . for the robustness study , only the uncertainty on the variable @xmath66 is considered , since the latter is the most influential parameter .",
    "three cases are considered : @xmath66=0.14 ( nominal value ) , @xmath66=0.21 and @xmath66=0.07  h@xmath9 .",
    "these values are chosen from the confidence interval on this variable @xcite .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - c1 ] .",
    "the two control laws achieve the tracking of the reference biomass concentration , with similar time responses .",
    "first , the control is canceled , _",
    "i.e. _ , the system operates in the batch mode , so that the biomass concentration reaches almost the reference value .",
    "then , after about @xmath67 hours , the control input switches to a continuous mode and a dilution is applied so that the output is maintained at the desired value . at time",
    "@xmath60 hours onwards , the reference value decreases to 0.17  kg / m@xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the controllers apply a higher dilution rate to dilute the culture and attain the new reference value ( after about 5 h ) .",
    "then , the dilution rate reaches a constant value that maintains the output at this new reference .",
    "it can be noticed that the model - based controller is sensitive to the value of the parameter @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , the reference tracking presents an offset in this case .",
    "the response with the model - free controller on the other hand is offset - free .",
    "its robustness is highlighted .",
    "the controllers are now compared in the case of a constant biomass concentration setpoint @xmath68 kg / m@xmath5 , with a time - varying incident light intensity .",
    "the latter is assumed to follow a profile depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - c2p ] , _ i.e. _ , it is chosen in order to be similar to a day / night cycle of a solar light except the minimum level of incident light , which has been set to 100 @xmath69mol / m@xmath34/s , here .",
    "the controllers tuning parameters and the simulation conditions are similar to those considered in section [ cas1 ] .",
    "simulation results , illustrated by fig . [ fig - c2 ] , show that despite the light variation , considered here as a disturbance , the two control laws maintain the output at its reference value .",
    "indeed , the dilution rate is modified , according to the incident light profile . nevertheless , the model - free controller performs better than the model - based one .",
    "the model - based controller is again sensitive to the uncertainty of @xmath66 .",
    "its drawback is here also underlined .",
    "the model - free control strategy yields better performances than the model - based one , in terms of    * setpoint tracking and robustness with respect to model uncertainties , * no modeling perequisite , _",
    "i.e. _ , * * only the output variable needs to be known , * * the estimation of the state variables becomes useless , * easy and costless implementation .",
    "an experimental set - up and the control of the specific growth rate for insuring a high level of biomass growth are now being developed .",
    "they will hopefully be presented soon .",
