    "mean - field models with effective interactions like the skyrme force @xcite or the gogny force @xcite , are widely applied to various fields in nuclear physics with great success .",
    "the relativistic mean field theory is also applied to many nuclear systems successfully @xcite .",
    "these models are based on the single - particle picture of the nuclear many - body system . in this picture",
    ", a nucleon in a nucleus is moving in a nuclear mean field made by other nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the single - particle picture is known to be appropriate in the wide range of nuclear phenomena since the establishment of the shell model @xcite .",
    "usually , the effective interactions used in nuclear mean - field models only have the central and ls parts as the nuclear two - body interactions .",
    "they do not have the tensor part .",
    "however , the tensor force is known to be very important in the structure of nuclei @xcite . the tensor force is mainly mediated by the pion , which is one of the most important meson since yukawa proposed it as a mediator of the nuclear force @xcite .",
    "many studies have demonstrated that the tensor force gives large attractive energy in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the shell model calculation shows that the tensor force can produce about a half of single - particle _ ls _ splittings in light nuclei @xcite .",
    "these facts show that the tensor force is an essential ingredient of the structure of light nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the tensor force plays an important role in the saturation mechanism of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that the tensor force may have an important effect also on the structure of nuclei in the heavy mass region .",
    "the importance of the tensor force mentioned above inspires us to treat the tensor force seriously even in a mean - field model .",
    "many people , however , believe that the effect of the tensor force can be treated by renormalizing the central and ls parts of the effective two - body interaction .",
    "this renormalization is founded by the g - matrix theory , where the effective interaction is made by renormalizing the central and ls forces to include the effect of the tensor force together with the short - range correlation . in the g - matrix theory ,",
    "the effective tensor force is weakened and treated simply as the residual interaction .",
    "the main part of the tensor force is included in the @xmath0e part of the central force .",
    "we see the importance of the tensor force by comparing the theoretical results for nuclear matter and the alpha particle . in nuclear matter ,",
    "the ratio of the energy contribution from the @xmath0e part of the effective interaction and that from @xmath1e is nearly equal to 1 , but in the alpha particle , this ratio increases to about 1.5 @xcite .",
    "this enhancement of the energy contribution from the @xmath0e component indicates that the effect of the tensor force is larger in the alpha particle than in nuclear matter , and the tensor force should be more important in finite nuclei than in nuclear matter .",
    "there are some hartree - fock calculations using the nuclear forces which include the tensor force @xcite or the pion @xcite explicitly .",
    "they show that the tensor force gives a large contribution to the _ ls _ splitting of single - particle states especially in the spin - unsaturated nuclei .",
    "in contrast to the conventional mean - field calculations , we recently proposed a new method to treat the pion in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory @xcite .",
    "because the pion is a pseudoscalar meson , a single - particle state of a nucleon in a nuclear mean - field should change its parity when the nucleon emits or absorbs a pion .",
    "it suggests that we can incorporate the pion into the rmf theory by introducing parity - mixed single - particle states .",
    "the idea of the parity - mixed single - particle state was already discussed in the references @xcite many years ago . in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we applied this idea in the rmf theory and found that the pion mean field becomes finite , due to which the correlation induced by the pion is appropriately taken into account . this result",
    "is not restricted to a relativistic framework .",
    "we can treat the tensor force by the introduction of the parity - mixed single - particle states in a non - relativistic framework also .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to apply the same idea in a non - relativistic mean - field model and see the effect of the tensor force in the alpha particle .",
    "we make two major improvements compared to the previous study in the treatment of a nuclear many - body system .",
    "the first improvement is straightforward as coming from the isovector character of the pion . because the pion is a isovector meson , a single - particle state in a mean field changes its charge state when it emits or absorbs a charged pion",
    "this fact indicates that the isovector nature of the pion can be treated by introducing charge - mixed single - particle states , which have both proton and neutron components .",
    "the dominant part of the tensor force is @xmath2-type and therefore this improvement is important when we treat the tensor force .",
    "the second improvement is related with the restoration of symmetry .",
    "we mix the parities and the charges into a single - particle state .",
    "a total wave function made from the single - particle states with the parity and charge mixings does not have a good parity and a definite charge number .",
    "therefore we need to perform the parity projection and the charge ( number ) projection to obtain a total wave function having a good parity and a definite charge number . by performing the projections",
    "we can pick up the 2-particle2-hole , the 4-particle4-hole , @xmath3 correlations , which are induced by the tensor force for the ground state of even - even mass nuclei @xcite , and are important in the binding mechanism from light nuclei to nuclear matter .",
    "we may think of performing the charge and parity projections after we obtain a total wave function assuming the charge and parity mixings ( projection after variation ) . because the effect of the tensor force is strong and affect the binding mechanism of nuclei largely , we need to treat the restoration of the parity and charge symmetries carefully .",
    "therefore , in a more sophisticated way , we should first perform the parity and charge projections , and then take a variation of the energy expectation value which is evaluated with the projected total wave function ( variation after projection ( vap ) ) . in the present study we perform calculations for the alpha particle in the vap scheme and show that the vap scheme is needed to treat the tensor force more appropriately .",
    "we should note that the present framework is not a simple mean - field model because we effectively superpose many slater determinants by performing the projections . in this sense ,",
    "our framework is a kind of descriptions beyond the mean field @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section  [ sec : cpphf ] , we will formulate the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock method . in section  [",
    "sec : result ] we will apply the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock method to the alpha particle to show the effectiveness of our method . in the last section we will give the summary .",
    "we present the charge- and parity - projected hartree - fock ( cpphf ) method . in the cpphf method",
    ", we construct a total wave function with single - particle states with the parity and charge mixings .",
    "a single - particle wave function with the charge and parity mixings in the spherical case is written as , @xmath4 this wave function consists of four terms , each of which has a positive or negative parity , and a charge number , 1 or 0 ( proton or neutron ) . here ,",
    "the radial wave functions @xmath5 s depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath6 , the isospin wave functions are denoted as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 for proton and @xmath9 for neutron ) , and @xmath10 is the eigenfunction of total spin @xmath11 . in the spherical case with the parity and charge mixings ,",

    "two angular wave functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related to each other as @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the pauli spin operator and @xmath18 is the unit radial vector . because @xmath19 is a @xmath20 operator , @xmath14 and @xmath21 have the same total angular momentum @xmath12 but different orbital angular momenta , _",

    "the symbol @xmath23 is introduced to label the single - particle states with the same @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in the cpphf method , @xmath23 does not correspond to the node quantum number because of the parity and charge mixings .",
    "we take a slater determinant made from the charge- and parity - mixed single - particle states as an intrinsic wave function for a nucleus with the mass number @xmath24 : @xmath25 here , @xmath26 denotes @xmath23 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 in ( [ eq : spwf ] ) and @xmath27 is the antisymmetrization operator . as already mentioned above , @xmath28 does not have a good parity and a definite charge number .",

    "we have applied the cpphf equation to the alpha particle and shown that the cpphf method is able to treat the strong tensor correlation . the variation after projection is very important to obtain the tensor correlation in the present framework , because the mixing of parity and charge does not occur if the parity and charge projections are not performed before variation .",
