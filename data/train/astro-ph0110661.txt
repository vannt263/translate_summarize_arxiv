    "the differences in the scales are most dramatic for young and metal@xmath0rich clusters which were not used to determine either calibration . some theoretical work ( e.g. , jorgensen , et al .",

    "an additional uncertainty in the calibration of @xmath11 to [ fe / h ] is the assumption of a galactic [ ca / fe ] vs.  [ fe / h ] relationship .",

    "since ca comes primarily from type ii supernovae and fe comes from both type ii and type ia supernovae ( e.g. , carney , b.w .  [ 1996 ] ) , the ratio of these elements will depend upon the sfh and chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
