    "the only other way for the f - curve to be contracted is if the spine is given positive degree but varying the cross - ratio of its attaching points no longer yields a 1-dimensional family of orbit closures .",
    "since we can assume each orbit closure is full - dimensional , this occurs precisely when the configuration of points in @xmath1 is supported on a collection of at most @xmath312 points , and we claim this occurs precisely when the second inequality in this proposition is satisfied . since the weight on the @xmath276 leg is @xmath311 , the inequality @xmath313 is equivalent to the @xmath276 leg having degree @xmath314 by the same argument as in the proof of proposition [ prop : cont ] .",

    "recall that for symmetric linearization @xmath8 we denote the polarization on @xmath15 by @xmath373 .",
    "the line bundle @xmath37 is nef and @xmath35-invariant , so it spans a ray in @xmath374 .",

    "each linearly independent curve contracted by @xmath24 forces @xmath37 to lie on a face of the symmetric nef cone of one higher codimension .",

    "this is automatic for @xmath406 , and for @xmath407 we must verify @xmath408 .",
    "this latter inequality boils down to @xmath409 , which holds even without the hypothesis that @xmath410 .",
    "thus we have verified that the family of @xmath411 curves is contracted by @xmath24 when @xmath378 .",
    "the remaining cases ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definitions 7.1 and 9.1 ) are similar .",
    "@xmath412      we immediately derive two results from theorem [ thm : cb ] and the work leading up to it .",
    "one is that since @xmath413 and @xmath37 span the same ray in @xmath29 and the former spans an extremal ray in the symmetric nef cone , the latter must do so as well .",
    "this is stated formally in corollary [ cor : extremal ] .",
    "a second consequence is that @xmath413 and @xmath37 contract the same set of f - curves , but proposition [ prop : symcont ] completely describes that set of curves , so we see that the list in proposition [ prop : cont2 ] must be complete as well :    [ cor : cont ] the complete linear system @xmath355 does not contract any further f - curves than those listed in proposition [ prop : cont2 ] .",
    "a third consequence is described in the following section .",
    "the gale transform , sometimes called _ association _ , is a classical construction associating to a configuration of @xmath0 sufficiently general points in @xmath1 , up to projectivity , a configuration of @xmath0 general points in @xmath52 , up to projectivity . in (",
    "* corollary iii.1 ) this was extended , using git , to partial compactifications of the space of general configurations , yielding an isomorphism of git quotients @xmath414 where @xmath8 denotes a symmetric linearization .",
    "note that the space of linearizations on the left - hand side is the hypersimplex @xmath415 , whereas on the right - hand side it is the hypersimplex @xmath416 .",
    "however , these two polytopes are naturally isomorphic : the former is the convex hull of all @xmath417 vectors in @xmath418 with 1 occurring in @xmath339 entries and the latter is the convex hull of those with 0 occurring in @xmath339 entries . under this identification",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the above isomorphism of git quotients applies for arbitrary linearizations , not just symmetric ones . by (",
    "* corollary 2.3.14 ) the gale transform extends to chow quotients as well .",
    "perhaps the easiest way to describe the gale transform is in terms of grassmannians via the gelfand - macpherson correspondence @xcite . for both chow and git quotients",
    "there is an isomorphism @xmath419 coming from the fact that both sides may be viewed as double quotients of the same space @xcite . indeed ,",
    "@xmath420 acts on the space of matrices @xmath421 by scaling each column , and @xmath422 acts on the left by multiplication .",
    "the quotient by the torus first then @xmath422 is the left - hand side of this isomorphism , and the quotient by @xmath422 then the torus is the right - hand side . in this framework",
    "the gale transform may then be viewed as an isomorphism @xmath423 which is obtained by simply taking orthogonal complements .",
    "one sees immediately from this description that the gale transform is involutive .",
    "as is described in @xcite , goppa recognized that the gale transform of a configuration of @xmath0 distinct points supported on a rational normal curve in @xmath1 is a configuration supported on a rational normal curve in @xmath52 .",
    "he did this in the context of algebraic coding theory to show that the dual of a goppa code is a goppa code .",
    "thus the image under the gale transform of @xmath98 is contained in @xmath424 , and for the same reason it sends @xmath424 to a subset of @xmath98 .",
    "but the gale transform is an involutive isomorphism so the arrows in the top row of the following commutative diagram must be isomorphisms : @xmath425 \\ar[r ] & u_{n - d-2,n}/\\text{sl}_{n - d-1 } \\ar[r ] \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] & u_{d , n}/\\text{sl}_{d+1 } \\ar@{^{(}->}[d ] \\\\",

    "therefore , goppa s result extends to quasi - veronese curves : the gale transform of a configuration supported on a quasi - veronese curve lies on a quasi - veronese curve .",
    "note that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 3.2 ) it is shown that goppa s result extends to gorenstein curves , but our quasi - veronese curves include examples of non - gorenstein curves .",
    "for instance , a spatial triple point as in figure [ fig : cubic ] is not gorenstein .",
    "it is well - known that conformal blocks satisfy @xmath47 .",
    "one way to see this is by the symmetry of the dynkin diagram @xmath427 for @xmath31 . from theorem [ thm : cb ]",
    "it then follows that if @xmath428 @xmath429 then the pulled - back symmetric polarizations @xmath430 and @xmath431 span the same ray in @xmath29 . thus @xmath432 and @xmath433 have the same stein factorizations up to a finite map , so the normalizations of their images are isomorphic : @xmath434 this proves corollary [ cor : gale ] .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we believe ( though have been unable to prove ) that the morphisms in theorem [ thm : morphism ] have connected fibers",
    ". if this is the case , then the above git quotients are normal so we get an isomorphism @xmath435 .",
    "therefore , with this assumption on the fibers we derive the same quasi - veronese generalization of goppa s result about the gale transform as above .",
    "consider configurations of @xmath436 points in @xmath97 . here",
    "the source and target are the same , so the gale transform provides an involution @xmath437 fixed points of this automorphism are called _ self - associated _ configurations .",
