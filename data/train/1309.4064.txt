    "projectile multifragmentation is a practical tool for producing exotic nuclei in the laboratory and remains a very active field of research both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this theoretical paper deals with one aspect of projectile fragmentation .",
    "there are many theoretical models for projectile multifragmentation : we will not try to give an exhaustive list .",
    "a few are : the statistical multifragmentation model(smm ) @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for application of smm to projectile fragmentation ) , ; heavy ion phase space exploration ( hipse ) model @xcite ( see also @xcite for an application ) ; antisymmetrised molecular dynamics ( amd ) model @xcite ( see also @xcite for applications ) ; the abrasion- ablation model of gaimard - schmidt - brohm @xcite , the epax@xcite model and others .    in recent times we proposed a model @xcite for projectile fragmentation whose predictions were compared with many experimental data with good success . in contrast with the models mentioned above our model uses the concept of temperature .",
    "the concept of temperature is quite familiar in heavy ion physics , whether to describe the physics of participants ( where the temperature can be very high ) or the physics of spectators ( where the temperature is expected to be much lower ) .",
    "the `` nuclear caloric curve '' was much researched as a signature of phase transition in nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "temperature of an emitting zone is often computed using the `` albergo '' formula @xcite .",
    "thus temperature is a useful concept in projectile spectator physics .",
    "our model has three parts . to start with we need an abrasion cross - section . for a given impact parameter , this",
    "was calculated using straight line trajectories for the projectile and the target leading to a definite mass and shape to the projectile like fragment ( plf ) .",
    "the plf created will not be at zero temperature .",
    "let us label the mass of the plf by @xmath0 , the mass of the projectile by @xmath1 .",
    "it was conjectured that that the temperature of the plf is a universal function of the wound @xmath2 .",
    "this was parameterized as @xcite : @xmath34.5mev\\ ] ] a select set of experimental data from sn on sn collisions @xcite were used in @xcite to arrive at the numbers above .",
    "the formula was seen to give very reasonable fits for many experimental data not only for sn on sn but other pairs of ions also .",
    "the objective of the present work is solely to investigate if we can arrive at the numbers generated by this simple parametrization from a microscopic theory .",
    "we may call this temperature the primordial temperature .",
    "the complete model does not stop here of course and many more steps are needed to calculate observables . we then postulate that this hot nuclear system will expand and break up into all possible composites dictated solely by phase space .",
    "this is the canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting hot composites will further evolve by two - body sequential decays leading to the final products measured by experiments .",
    "experimental results for many pairs of ions in the beam energy range 140 mev / n to 1 gev / n were fitted quite well by this model @xcite .",
    "our sole objective here is to estimate the value of the temperature of the plf when it is formed .",
    "we estimated this in a geometric model @xcite .",
    "as the numerical methods used for the geometric model will be extended to a dynamical transport model , we need to review the geometric model first .",
    "conceptually the geometric model is simple but the calculations are non - trivial .",
    "we assume that the size and shape of the plf is given by straight line cuts and that divisions between participants and spectators are very clean this excludes low beam energy .",
    "experiments at michigan used 140mev / n .",
    "we made an ad - hoc assumption that we can use straight line cuts at this beam energy and higher ; lower energy was not attempted . in the geometric model",
    ", some parts of the projectile are removed , which leaves the plf with a crooked shape .",
    "nuclear structure effects ascribe to this shape an excitation energy .",
    "we now use the ctm @xcite . in that model for",
    "a given mass and temperature one can compute the excitation energy per nucleon .",
    "we reverse the procedure to go from excitation energy to temperature .",
    "note that in the geometric model the beam energy does not enter the calculation , the only assumption being that it is large enough for straight line trajectories to be valid .    in later sections we try to estimate the plf temperature from a transport model boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) calculation .",
    "these are the principal results of this work .",
    "these calculations can be used for many purposes but we restrict ourselves only to the objective of trying to deduce a temperature for the plf .",
    "we start by choosing an impact paramater and boost one nucleus in its ground state towards the other nucleus also in its ground state . throughout this work",
    ", semi - classical physics is used .",
    "we use thomas - fermi(tf ) solutions for ground states .",
    "complete details of our procedure for tf solutions plus the choice of the interactions are given in ref .",
    "the kinetic energy density is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the phase space density .",
    "since we are looking for lowest energy we take , at each @xmath6 , @xmath7 to be non - zero from 0 to some maximum @xmath8 .",
    "thus we will have @xmath9\\ ] ] the factor 4 is due to spin - isospin degeneracy and using the spherical symmetry of the tf solution we have dropped the vector sign on @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to @xmath12^{2/3}\\int \\rho(r)^{5/3}d^3r\\ ] ] for potential energy we take @xmath13 the first two terms on the right hand side of the above equation are zero range skyrme interactions . the third which is a finite range term",
    "is often suppressed and the constants @xmath14 are chosen to fit nuclear matter equilibrium density , binding energy per nucleon and compressibility . in heavy ion collisions , for most purposes , this will be adequate but for what we seek here , possibly a small excitation energy , this is wholly inadequate .",
    "thomas - fermi solution is obtained by minimizing @xmath15 .",
    "with only zero range force , @xmath16 can be taken to be a constant which goes abruptly to zero at some @xmath17 fixed by the total number of nucleons .",
    "now if @xmath18 is chosen to minimize the energy then , a nucleus , at this density with a cubic shape is as good as a spherical nucleus . besides the minimum energy nucleus will have a sharp edge , not a realistic density distribution .",
    "this problem does not arise in quantum mechanical treatment with skyrme interaction . including a finite range potential in tf one recovers a more realistic density distribution for the ground state and one regains the nuclear structure effects which will contribute to excitation the plf .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thomas - fermi solutions for relevant nuclei were constructed with following force parameters .",
    "the constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( eq.4 ) were taken to be @xmath21=-1533.6 mev @xmath22 , @xmath23=2805.3 mev @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "for the finite range potential we chose an yukawa : @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 with @xmath28=-668.65 mev and @xmath29=0.45979 fm .",
    "binding energies and density profiles for many finite nuclei with these parameters ( and several others ) are given in ref .",
    "these have been used in the past to construct tf solutions which collide in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "we use the method of test particles to evaluate excitation energies of a plf with any given shape .",
    "the method of test particles is well - known from use of buu models for heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "earlier applications were made by wong @xcite .",
    "we will use the method of test particles for the geometric model and as well as for buu calculations in the later sections .",
    "we first construct a tf solution using iterative techniques @xcite .",
    "the tf phase space distribution will then be modeled by choosing test particles with appropriate positions and momenta using monte - carlo . in most of this work",
    "we consider 100 test particles ( @xmath30 ) for each nucleon .",
    "for example , the phase space distribution of @xmath31ni is described by 5800 test particles .",
    "a plf can be constructed by removing a set of test particles . which test particles will be removed depends upon collision geometry envisaged .",
    "for example , consider central collision of @xmath31ni on @xmath32be .",
    "let @xmath33 to be the beam direction . for impact parameter @xmath34=0",
    "we remove all test particles in @xmath31ni whose distance from the center of mass of @xmath31ni has @xmath35 where @xmath36 fm is the half radius of @xmath37 .",
    "the cases of non - zero impact parameter can be similarly considered .",
    "we want to point out that this procedure of removing test particles from the projectile may produce an error if the target is small and/or for very peripheral collisions even if both the target and the projectile are heavy . there can be transparency when small amounts of nuclear matter are traversed .",
    "however this prescription of removing test particles from the projectile when they are in the way of the target produces very definite predictions .",
    "the transparency problem is treated well in the transport model that we will get into later .",
    "continuing with the geometric model , we assume that the shape and momentum distribution of the plf can be described by removing some test particles as described above .",
    "of course this plf will undergo many more changes later but all we are concerned with is the energy of the system at the time of `` separation '' .",
    "since the plf now is an isolated system , the energy will be conserved . of course the coulomb force from the participants",
    "will continue to be felt by the plf .",
    "but the major effect of this will be on overall translation of the plf and all we are interested in is intrinsic energy .",
    "we now describe how we calculate the energy of this `` crooked '' shape object .",
    "the mass number of the plf is the sum of the number of test particles remaining divided by @xmath38 .",
    "similarly the total kinetic energy of the plf is the sum of kinetic energies of the remaining teat particles divided by @xmath38 .",
    "evaluating potential energy requires much more work .",
    "we need a smooth density to be generated by positions of test particles .",
    "we use the method of lenk and pandharipande to obtain this smooth density .",
    "other methods are possible @xcite . experience has shown that vlasov propagation with lenk - pandharipande prescription conserves energy and momenta very well @xcite .",
    "for the geometric model time propagation is not needed .",
    "we will need that for buu calculations in later sections .",
    "the configuration space is divided into cubic lattices .",
    "the lattice points are @xmath39 fm apart .",
    "thus the configuration space is discretized into boxes of size @xmath40@xmath22 .",
    "density at lattice point @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 the form factor is @xmath43 where @xmath44 the advantage of this form factor is detailed in @xcite so we will not enter that discussion here . in this work we have always used @xmath39=1 fm and @xmath45=1",
    "it remains to state how we evaluate the potential energy term ( eq.(5 ) ) .",
    "the zero range skyrme interaction contributions are very simple .",
    "for example the first term is calculated by using @xmath46 with our choice @xmath40=1 @xmath22 . for the third term in eq.(5 ) ( the yukawa term ) is rewritten as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the potential at @xmath6 due to the yukawa , i.e.,@xmath49 .",
    "the calculation of yukawa ( and/or coulomb ) potential due to a charge distribution which is specified at points of cubic lattices is very non - trivial and involves iterative procedure .",
    "this has been used a great deal in applications involving time - dependent hartree - fock theory .",
    "we will just give the references @xcite .",
    "we also found an unpublished msu report very helpful @xcite .    with this method",
    "we can calculate the total energy of the plf .",
    "however we are interested in excitation energy of the system which requires us to find the ground state energy of the plf which has lost some nucleons from the projectile .",
    "we can use tf theory to find this .",
    "the iterative tf solution also gives the ground state energy .",
    "but then we will be using two different methods for evaluating energies , one for the plf crooked shape and a different one for the plf ground state . although the results are quite close , it is more consistent to use the same prescription for ground state energy and excitation energy .",
    "hence , even for the ground state energy we generate test particles and go through the same procedure as for the plf with crooked shape .",
    "however we are not finished yet .",
    "the canonical thermodynamic model ( ctm ) uses temperature .",
    "however for a given temperature , mass number and charge , the average excitation energy per nucleon can be can be calculated @xcite . given an excitation energy this can be used to deduce a temperature for the plf mass .",
    "results of the geometric model can be found in a recent publication @xcite .",
