    "ab initio nuclear structure theory has undergone an amazing development over the past few years , strengthening its role for our understanding of nuclear structure properties on the basis of the strong interaction physics .",
    "one of the most active frontiers is the extension of ab initio theories towards heavier nuclei , i.e. , beyond the limit around mid p - shell that was characteristic for ab initio approaches a decade ago @xcite . on the one hand , existing many - body frameworks , such as the no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite or quantum monte carlo methods @xcite , have been improved and extended towards heavier systems . a specific example is the importance truncated ncsm ( it - ncsm ) @xcite , which extends the domain of ncsm - type calculations into the lower sd - shell . on the other hand , a new generation of many - body methods",
    "have been introduced to ab initio nuclear theory , such as coupled - cluster theory @xcite , self - consistent green s function methods @xcite , or the in - medium similarity renormalization group @xcite , aiming directly at medium - mass nuclei . in many of the recent applications two - nucleon ( nn ) and three - nucleon ( 3n ) interactions from chiral effective field theory ( eft )",
    "are being used as starting point and connection to the underlying physics of the strong interaction @xcite . in comparison to the more phenomenological realistic hamiltonians used a decade ago , chiral eft offers a consistent and systematically improvable approach to two- , three- , and multi - nucleon interactions as well as the corresponding electromagnetic and weak operators . from the point of view of nuclear structure observables in light nuclei , already the present generation of chiral nn+3n interaction provides a quantitative description comparable to the best previous realisitc hamiltonians @xcite .    when pushing the ab initio frontier to nuclei beyond the lower p - shell ,",
    "a particular challenge is the proper inclusion of the 3n interaction at all stages of the calculation .",
    "part of this challenge is the computation and handling of the 3n matrix elements entering the many - body calculations for large model spaces .",
    "the huge number of @xmath1-scheme 3n matrix elements that need to be stored in memory limited the range of previous ncsm calculations @xcite .",
    "new developments regarding the computation and handling of 3n matrix elements are mandatory to extend the ab initio frontier beyond the lower p - shell .",
    "similarly , the unitary transformations that are used to enhance the convergence behavior of the many - body calculations have to be extended to the 3n sector . in many of the recent ab initio applications",
    "the similarity renormalization group ( srg ) is used , since its formal extension to 3n and multi - nucleon interactions is straightforward @xcite .",
    "however , the various truncations , e.g. , regarding the model spaces used for the numerical solution of the srg flow equations or the particle rank of the induced many - body contributions , need to be validated .",
    "the uncertainties associated with these truncations are expected to become more significant with increasing particle number . finally , the many - body approach has to be extended to efficiently include the 3n contributions . in the case of the ncsm",
    "this step is straightforward , for methods like coupled - cluster theory it requires a non - trivial extension of the formalism @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can resort to controlled approximations , such as the normal - ordering approximation discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , to partially include 3n interactions while avoiding extensions of the formalism beyond the level of two - body interactions .    in this technical paper",
    "we discuss a chain of key developments enabling the consistent inclusion of chiral 3n interactions into ab initio calculations beyond the lower p - shell , by addressing each of the challenges mentioned above . in sec .",
    "[ sec : me ] we discuss the computation of 3n matrix elements starting from a harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis formulated in three - body jacobi coordinates .",
    "we discuss the transformation of the 3n matrix elements to the @xmath0-coupled scheme first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is used as input for the many - body calculation in conjunction with an efficient on - the - fly decoupling to the @xmath1-scheme . in sec .",
    "[ sec : srg ] we discuss the consistent srg evolution of the hamiltonian at the three - body level .",
    "we focus on the evolution in a ho representation and introduce new tools , such as the frequency conversion , to overcome limitations of the ho model space . in sec .",
    "[ sec : itncsm ] we discuss the it - ncsm with explicit 3n interactions and discuss threshold extrapolations of energies and spectroscopic observables .    utilizing these tools , in sec .",
    "[ sec : prop ] , we critically assess the role of various truncations introduced in the srg - transformed hamiltonian .",
    "we show ways to remedy truncation errors resulting from the srg model space and analyze the emergence and the origin of induced beyond-3n interactions .",
    "we show that reducing the initial chiral cutoff of the 3n interaction quickly suppresses the srg - induced beyond-3n contributions leading to an srg - evolved hamiltonian with acceptable truncation uncertainties that was already adopted in several applications to medium - mass nuclei @xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : comp ] we compare our results to a recent ncsm study @xcite using a more conventional toolchain and discuss different model - space extrapolations .",
    "the basic input for any many - body approach using a basis expansion within a truncated many - body hilbert space are appropriate matrix elements of the hamiltonian . in the context of the ncsm",
    ", the underlying basis is given by the eigenstates of the spherical harmonic oscillator ( ho ) , either in the form of @xmath2-body slater - determinants of single - particle ho states , the so - called @xmath1-scheme , or in the form of relative ho states with respect to @xmath2-body jacobi coordinates .",
    "we will focus on the @xmath1-scheme formulation , since it is much more convenient when going beyond the lightest nuclei  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is more universal and directly applies to other many - body schemes , such as hartree - fock calculations , general configuration interaction approaches , or the coupled - cluster method .    for an @xmath1-scheme calculation",
    "a hamiltonian containing nn and 3n interactions enters in terms of two- and three - body matrix elements with respect to slater determinants of two and three ho single - particle states .",
    "a prerequisite for a many - body calculation is that these matrix elements can be computed and stored efficiently for sufficiently large basis sizes .",
    "the computation of these @xmath1-scheme matrix elements typically involves a multi - step process , which is well established for the two - body matrix elements of the nn interaction .",
    "the starting point is an initial representation of the interaction .",
    "typically , one starts with either an operator representation of the interaction or , more conveniently , with a basis representation in a partial - wave decomposed relative - momentum basis @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the relative momentum of the nucleon pair and @xmath5 are the standard @xmath6-coupled partial - wave quantum numbers including total isospin @xmath7 and isospin projection @xmath8 .",
    "this basis representation approach has been established as a standard for the chiral nn interactions  @xcite . in a first step ,",
    "we compute relative ho matrix elements for the basis @xmath9 with radial ho quantum number @xmath10 using a simple basis transformation . in a second step , the relative ho matrix elements can be converted through a talmi - moshinsky transformation plus angular momentum recouplings @xcite into @xmath1-scheme matrix elements with respect to the antisymmetrized two - body states @xmath11 with single - particle ho quantum numbers . in order to reduce the storage requirements for the two - body matrix elements and to exploit the symmetries of the two - body interaction , one generally does not store @xmath1-scheme matrix elements directly , but a simple @xmath0-coupled form with respect to the basis states @xmath12 .",
    "the decoupling to pure @xmath1-scheme matrix elements is done on the fly during the many - body calculation .",
    "for the 3n interaction , we follow the exactly same route , though each of the steps is significantly more involved .",
    "again , the 3n interaction is initially given in an operator form or in a partial - wave decomposed jacobi - momentum basis . in a first step , the latter can be transformed into a partial - wave jacobi - coordinate ho basis , which also gives an easy handle on antisymmetrization .",
    "then in a second step , we could transform from jacobi to @xmath1-scheme ho matrix elements through a sequence of two talmi - moshinsky transformations and recouplings .",
    "this strategy was used in previous large - scale applications of chiral 3n interaction in the ncsm , see e.g. ref .",
    "we propose to use @xmath0-coupled three - body matrix elements for a more efficient storage and retrieval combined with an on - the - fly decoupling during the many - body calculation  @xcite , in complete analogy to the standard procedure for two - body matrix elements .",
    "we will discuss the details and the advantages of this scheme in the following .",
    "for the chiral 3n interaction , the computation of initial partial - wave decomposed relative matrix elements can be challenging already . to be specific , we consider three - body matrix elements with respect to the two jacobi momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the three - body system , defined by  @xcite @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 are the single - particle momenta of the three nucleons .",
    "the jacobi momentum @xmath17 characterizing the center - of - mass motion is irrelevant for the description of the intrinsic dynamics .",
    "we systematically use numeric indices for quantities defined with respect to relative jacobi coordinates and latin indices for quantities defined with respect to single - particle coordinates .",
    "for example , @xmath18 denotes a relative orbital angular - momentum quantum number with respect to the first jacobi coordinate @xmath13 , whereas @xmath19 denotes a single - particle orbital angular momentum . as a general rule",
    ", we use capital letters for angular momentum , spin and isospin quantum numbers that involve more than one particle and lower - case letters for single - particle quantum numbers .",
    "the starting point for the following calculation is a partial - wave representation of the jacobi - momentum basis in the three - nucleon system . using a @xmath20-coupling scheme for the two total angular momenta @xmath21 and @xmath22 associated with the jacobi momenta @xmath23 and @xmath24 we write the basis states as @xmath25 j_{12 } ; ( t_1 { \\ensuremath{\\tfrac{1}{2 } } } )",

    "we omit the projection quantum numbers @xmath27 and @xmath28 for brevity .",
    "note that these basis states have a well - defined transposition symmetry only with respect to the particles @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we will discuss the complete antisymmetrization in the context of the jacobi - ho matrix elements in sec .",
    "[ sec:3nme_jacobiho ] .",
    "the computation of matrix elements of the chiral 3n interaction in this basis is the first step . for 3n interactions at n@xmath31lo",
    "there are only five different momentum - spin - isospin structures , for which a partial wave decomposition can be performed explicitly .",
    "this is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite for different formulations of the regulators .",
    "for the chiral 3n interaction at n@xmath32lo  the situation changes radically .",
    "recently , the derivation of cartesian momentum - space structures of the 3n interaction at n@xmath32lo  was completed  @xcite . in view of the many different momentum - spin - isospin operators involved ,",
    "a manual partial - wave decomposition is hardly feasible .",
    "therefore , an automatized partial - wave decomposition was recently proposed by skibiski et al .",
    "@xcite , which uses numerical integrations over five angular variables to extract partial - wave jacobi - momentum matrix elements . as a result tabulated numerical values of the matrix elements on a four - dimensional grid of jacobi momenta will be available for subsequent calculations .",
    "the partial - wave decomposition is computationally quite expensive and there is an ongoing collaborative effort within the lenpic collaboration to generate those matrix elements for the chiral interaction at n@xmath32lo  for use in nuclear structure calculations .      when aiming at many - body calculations using an ho basis , it is convenient to transform the three - body jacobi matrix elements into an ho representation right away .",

    "@xcite we denote antisymmetrized jacobi - ho states as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the principal ho quantum number of the jacobi - ho state , @xmath41 is the total angular momentum and parity of the relative motion and @xmath42 the total isospin .",

    "@xcite . instead of precomputing @xmath1-scheme matrix elements , we only precompute and store the @xmath0-coupled matrix elements defined by eq .  .",
    "all the computationally demanding steps of the transformation are still done in the precompute phase . however , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : memoryneeds ] , the storage needed for the @xmath0-coupled matrix elements is reduced by up to three orders of magnitude . for an @xmath85 p - shell calculation",
    "only @xmath89 gb of storage is needed for the three - body matrix elements in single precision .",
    "the price to pay for this gain is the on - the - fly decoupling   of the three - body matrix elements during the many - body calculation .",
    "we have optimized the storage scheme for the @xmath0-coupled matrix elements to facilitate a fast and cache - optimized on - the - fly decoupling : we store the values of the matrix elements in a one - dimensional vector .",
    "the order and position of the matrix elements is defined via a fixed loop - order for all quantum numbers of the @xmath0-coupled matrix elements .",
    "the six outer loops are defined by the quantum numbers @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 of the single - particle orbitals , where we exploit antisymmetry and hermeticity .",
    "the six inner loops are defined by the coupled quantum numbers @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath57 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath7 in this specific order .",
    "the three innermost isospin loops run over all 5 possible combinations of the isospin quantum numbers and can be unrolled manually .",

    "both , the storage of the resulting @xmath0-coupled matrix elements and the caching of the @xmath7 coefficients requires similar and substantial amounts of memory , as illustrated in fig .",

    "for present cpu - based architectures the storage of @xmath0-coupled matrix elements combined with the one - the - fly decoupling to the @xmath1-scheme seems to be the optimal compromise .",
    "although the interactions from chiral eft are comparatively soft due to the momentum - space cutoff used to regularize the chiral interactions , it is still difficult to converge ncsm - type calculations beyond the lightest nuclei . therefore , additional transformations are used to enhance the convergence behavior of the many - body calculation .",
    "the two transformation methods that have been successfully used with 3n interactions are the okubo - lee - suzuki ( ols ) similarity transformation  @xcite and the similarity renormalization group ( srg )  @xcite .",
    "the ols transformation aims at a complete decoupling of a specific many - body model space from the excluded space  as a result the similarity - transformed hamiltonian depends on basis , model - space size and nucleus . the srg transformation in its standard formulation  @xcite aims at a generic decoupling of low - momentum or low - energy states from high - lying states and leads to a universal , model - space- and nucleus - independent hamiltonian .",
    "this has significant practical advantages , since the same transformed interaction can be used in different many - body approaches , from simple hartree - fock - type approaches to coupled - cluster theory and the ncsm .",

    "@xmath36 the hamiltonian approaches this fixed point and , thus , it is evolving into a band - diagonal structure with respect to the eigenbasis of the kinetic energy , i.e. , momentum eigenstates .",
    "for this specific generator it makes sense to associate the flow parameter @xmath36 with a momentum scale @xmath113 as its often done in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the generator   is not connected to a specific choice of nucleus or basis used in the subsequent many - body calculations .",
    "it only reflects the generic goal of decoupling low- and high - momentum components of the model space through a unitary transformation that preserves the complete information of the initial hamiltonian .    owing to its flexibility",
    ", the srg framework can also be adapted to other decoupling scenarios .",
    "considering the @xmath2-body ground state of a specific nucleus one can design srg generators that decouple a reference state , e.g. , a simple hartree - fock determinant representing the nucleus under consideration , from all particle - hole excitations .",
    "once a complete decoupling is achieved , the energy expectation value of the reference state yields the exact ground - state energy , since , e.g. , a full configuration interaction calculation would not admix any particle - hole excitation to this state anymore . in order to handle the srg evolution in @xmath2-body space ,",
    "one can use normal - ordering with respect to the reference state to derive evolution equations for the normal - ordered zero- one- and two - body terms of the hamiltonian , which are an approximation to the full @xmath2-body evolution .",

    "all the above equations are general operator relations in an @xmath2-body hilbert space or even fock space . in order to solve them numerically",
    "we have to switch to a basis representation in a hilbert space and we will typically not be able to handle the solution in @xmath2-body space .",
    "we have to rely on solutions of the flow equations in few - nucleon spaces to construct the evolved hamiltonian .",
    "this limitation becomes a potential problem since the unitary transformation induces many - body contributions to the evolved operators that go beyond the particle rank of the initial operator .",
    "if we assume an initial hamiltonian containing a two - nucleon interaction , then it is evident from eqs .   and   that an ( infinitesimal ) step of the flow evolution will induce irreducible operator contributions beyond the two - body level . at any finite flow parameter @xmath36 the evolved hamiltonian contains irreducible operator contributions to all particle numbers",

    "we conclude that starting from mid - p - shell , srg - induced 4n interactions ( or even higher - order contributions ) start to have an impact on ground - state energies as soon as we include the standard chiral 3n interaction in the initial hamiltonian . at this moment",

    "present medium - mass approaches , e.g. , coupled - cluster theory , typically work in model spaces obtained from a finite set of hartree - fock single - particle states , which are not compatible with the @xmath84 truncation of the 3n matrix elements .",
