    "scattering processes at high energy hadron colliders can be classified as either hard or soft .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the underlying theory for all such processes , but the approach and level of understanding is very different for the two cases . for hard processes , e.g. higgs boson or high @xmath1 jet production , the rates and event properties can be predicted with good precision using perturbation theory . for soft processes ,",
    "e.g. the total cross section , the underlying event etc . , the rates and properties are dominated by non - perturbative qcd effects , which are less well understood . for many hard processes , soft interactions",
    "are occurring along with the hard interactions and their effects must be understood for comparisons to be made to perturbative predictions .",
    "an understanding of the rates and characteristics of predictions for hard processes , both signals and backgrounds , using perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is crucial for both the tevatron and lhc .    in this review article",
    ", we will develop the perturbative framework for the calculation of hard scattering processes .",
    "we will undertake to provide both a reasonably rigorous development of the formalism of hard scattering of quarks and gluons as well as an intuitive understanding of the physics behind the scattering .",
    "we will emphasize the role of logarithmic corrections as well as power counting in @xmath0 in order to understand the behaviour of hard scattering processes .",
    "we will include `` rules of thumb '' as well as `` official recommendations '' , and where possible will seek to dispel some myths .",
    "we will also discuss the impact of soft processes on the measurements of hard scattering processes .",
    "given the limitations of space , we will concentrate on a few processes , mostly inclusive jet , @xmath2 production , and @xmath3jets , but the lessons should be useful for other processes at the tevatron and lhc as well . as a bonus feature , this paper is accompanied by a `` benchmark website ''  , where updates and more detailed discussions than are possible in this limited space will be available .",
    "we will refer to this website on several occasions in the course of this review article .    in section  [ sec : formalism",
    "] , we introduce the hard scattering formalism and the qcd factorization theorem . in section",
    "[ sec : partonxsecs ] , we apply this formalism to some basic processes at leading order , next - to - leading order and next - to - next - to - leading order .",
    "section  [ sec : pdfs ] provides a detailed discussion of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and global pdf fits and in section  [ sec : tevatron ] we compare the predictions of pqcd to measurements at the tevatron .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec : lhc ] , we provide some benchmarks and predictions for measurements to be performed at the lhc .",
    "in this section we will discuss in more detail how the qcd factorization theorem can be used to calculate a wide variety of hard scattering cross sections in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "for simplicity we will restrict our attention to leading - order processes and calculations ; the extension of the formalism to more complicated processes and to include higher - order perturbative contributions will be discussed in sections  [ sec : partonxsecs ] and  [ sec : lhc ] .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the factorization theorem .",
    "it was first pointed out by drell and yan @xcite more than 30 years ago that parton model ideas developed for deep inelastic scattering could be extended to certain processes in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the paradigm process was the production of a massive lepton pair by quark - antiquark annihilation  the drell  yan process  and it was postulated that the hadronic cross section @xmath4 could be obtained by weighting the subprocess cross section @xmath5 for @xmath6 with the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath7 extracted from deep inelastic scattering : @xmath8 where for the drell  yan process , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the domain of validity is the asymptotic `` scaling '' limit ( the analogue of the bjorken scaling limit in deep inelastic scattering ) @xmath11 , @xmath12 fixed .",
    "the good agreement between theoretical predictions and the measured cross sections provided confirmation of the parton model formalism , and allowed for the first time a rigorous , quantitative treatment of certain hadronic cross sections .",
    "studies were extended to other `` hard scattering '' processes , for example the production of hadrons and photons with large transverse momentum , with equally successful results .",
    "problems , however , appeared to arise when perturbative corrections from real and virtual gluon emission were calculated .",
    "large logarithms from gluons emitted collinear with the incoming quarks appeared to spoil the convergence of the perturbative expansion .",
    "it was subsequently realized that these logarithms were the same as those that arise in deep inelastic scattering structure function calculations , and could therefore be absorbed , via the dglap equations , in the definition of the parton distributions , giving rise to logarithmic violations of scaling .",
    "the key point was that _ all _ logarithms appearing in the drell  yan corrections could be factored into renormalized parton distributions in this way , and _",
    "factorization theorems _ which showed that this was a general feature of hard scattering processes were derived  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the leading logarithm corrections , simply becomes : @xmath13 corresponding to the structure depicted in figure  [ basicstruct ] .",
    "the @xmath14 that appears in the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) is a large momentum scale that characterizes the hard scattering , e.g. @xmath15 , @xmath16 , ... .",
    "changes to the @xmath14 scale of @xmath17 , e.g. @xmath18 are equivalent in this leading logarithm approximation .",
    "the final step in the theoretical development was the recognition that the _ finite _ corrections left behind after the logarithms had been factored were not universal and had to be calculated separately for each process , giving rise to perturbative @xmath19 corrections to the leading logarithm cross section of .",
    "schematically @xmath20_{ab\\to x } \\ . \\label{signlo}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 is the _ factorization scale _ , which can be thought of as the scale that separates the long- and short - distance physics , and @xmath22 is the _ renormalization scale _ for the qcd running coupling .",
    "formally , the cross section calculated to all orders in perturbation theory is invariant under changes in these parameters , the @xmath23 and @xmath24 dependence of the coefficients , e.g. @xmath25 , exactly compensating the explicit scale dependence of the parton distributions and the coupling constant .",
    "this compensation becomes more exact as more terms are included in the perturbation series , as will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : scaledep ] . in the absence of a complete set of higher order corrections ,",
    "it is necessary to make a specific choice for the two scales in order to make cross section predictions .",
    "different choices will yield different ( numerical ) results , a reflection of the uncertainty in the prediction due to unknown higher order corrections , see section  3 . to avoid unnaturally large logarithms reappearing in the perturbation series it is sensible to choose @xmath21 and @xmath22 values of the order of the typical momentum scales of the hard scattering process , and @xmath26 is also often assumed . for the drell - yan process , for example , the standard choice is @xmath27 , the mass of the lepton pair .",
    "the recipe for using the above leading - order formalism to calculate a cross section for a given ( inclusive ) final state @xmath28anything is very simple : ( i ) identify the leading - order partonic process that contributes to @xmath29 , ( ii ) calculate the corresponding @xmath30 , ( iii ) combine with an appropriate combination ( or combinations ) of pdfs for the initial - state partons @xmath31 and @xmath32 , ( iv ) make a specific choice for the scales @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and ( v ) perform a numerical integration over the variables @xmath33 , @xmath34 and any other phase - space variables associated with the final state @xmath29 .",
    "some simple examples are    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     first , a few general statements : in general , signatures for new physics will involve high @xmath1 leptons and jets ( especially @xmath32 jets ) and missing transverse momentum .",
    "thus , backgrounds to new physics will tend to involve ( multiple ) vector boson production ( with jets ) and @xmath35 pair production ( with jets ) .",
    "the best manner in which to understand the normalization of a cross section is to measure it ; however the rates for some of the complex final states listed here may be limited and ( at least in the early days ) must be calculated from nlo theory . as discussed at length previously , nlo is the first order at which both the normalization and shape can be calculated with any degree of confidence .",
    "we now turn to a detailed look at each of these processes :    * @xmath36  + jet : one of the most promising channels for higgs boson production in the low mass range is through the @xmath37 channel , with the @xmath38 s decaying semi - leptonically .",
    "it is useful to look both in the @xmath39 exclusive channel , along with the @xmath39+jet channel .",
    "the calculation of @xmath40+jet will be especially important in understanding the background to the latter .",
    "* @xmath41  jets : a measurement of vector boson fusion ( vbf ) production of the higgs boson will allow the determination of the higgs coupling to vector bosons .",
    "one of the key signatures for this process is the presence of forward - backward tagging jets .",
    "thus , qcd production of @xmath42 + 2 jets must be understood , especially as the rates for the two are comparable in the kinematic regions of interest . *",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 + 2 jets : both of these processes serve as background to @xmath45 , where the higgs boson decays into a @xmath46 pair .",
    "the rate for @xmath47 is much greater than that for @xmath48 and thus , even if 3 @xmath32-tags are required , there may be a significant chance for the heavy flavour mistag of a @xmath47 event to contribute to the background . *",
    "@xmath49 : such a signature serves as non - resonant background to @xmath35 production as well as to possible new physics .",
    "* @xmath50  jets : the process serves as a background to vbf production of a higgs boson .",
    "* @xmath51  jets : the process serves as background for @xmath35 production where one of the jets may not be reconstructed , as well as for various new physics signatures involving leptons , jets and missing transverse momentum .",
    "* @xmath52 : the process serves as a background for various new physics subprocesses such as susy tri - lepton production .",
    "work on ( at least ) the processes 1 .",
    "to 4 . of table  [ wishlist ] is already in progress by several groups , and clearly all of them aim at a setup which allows for a straightforward application to other processes     from an experimentalist s point - of - view , the nlo calculations discussed thus far may be used to understand changes in normalization and/or shape that occur for a given process when going from lo to nlo  @xcite . as discussed previously , direct comparisons to the data require either a determination of parton - to - hadron corrections for the theory or hadron - to - parton corrections for the data  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , for multi - parton final states it is also necessary to model the effects of jet algorithms , when two or more partons may be combined into one jet .      here",
    "we discuss some of the standard model benchmark cross sections at the lhc .",
    "a lack of space will keep the discussion short , but a more complete treatment can be found at the benchmark website and also in the cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite physics technical design reports .      as discussed in section  [ sec : formalism ] , hard interactions at hadron - hadron colliders consist of a hard collision of two incoming partons along with softer interactions from the remaining partons in the colliding hadrons ( `` the underlying event energy '' ) .",
    "the underlying event will affect almost all measurements of physics processes at the lhc .",
    "some predictions for the underlying event charged multiplicities and charged momentum sum ( defined in section  [ sec : tevatron ] ) at the lhc are shown in figures  [ fig : ue_lhc ] and  [ fig : ue_lhc_pt ]",

    "the colour factor for the gluon is greater than that for the quark and the phase space available for gluon radiation for @xmath119 gluons is much larger due to the @xmath120 pole in the splitting function .",
    "the production of a higgs boson through the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) process is important , first of all , as a discovery channel and second , as a way of measuring the higgs couplings to @xmath38 and @xmath53 bosons .",
    "there are backgrounds to this process from ( 1 ) higgs@xmath121  jet production through @xmath74 fusion and ( 2 ) @xmath122  jet production , where the @xmath53 decays into @xmath123 pairs ( one of the primary search modes for higgs production from vbf )  @xcite .",

    "the rate for additional jets to be produced between the two tagging jets is high for the background processes   @xcite .",
    "the colourless exchange in the hard scattering in vbf leads to a suppression of extra jets in the central rapidity region .",
    "thus , as discussed earlier , a veto on extra jets in the central region is effective at decreasing the background to vbf production of the higgs boson .",
    "the increase of the centre - of - mass energy to @xmath128  tev at the lhc will result in a dramatically larger accessible kinematic range .",
    "inclusive jet cross sections can be measured out to transverse momentum values of order @xmath105  tev in the central region and @xmath129  tev in the forward region .",
    "the predictions with the cteq6.1 central pdfs and the @xmath107 error pdfs are shown in figure  [ fig : lhc_jet ] and  [ fig : lhc_ratios ] for three different rapidity regions  @xcite .",

    "measurements of the jet cross section over the full rapidity range at the lhc will serve to further constrain the high @xmath54 gluon pdf and distinguish between possible new physics and uncertainties in pdfs .",
    "it is useful to plot the @xmath132-factors ( the ratio of the nlo to lo cross sections ) for the three different rapidity intervals shown above . as discussed previously in section  [ sec : kfac ] , the value of the @xmath132-factor is a scale - dependent quantity ; the @xmath132-factors shown in figure  [ fig : kfactors ] are calculated with the nominal scale of @xmath130 .",

    "the @xmath132-factor is within @xmath102 of unity for the observable range .",
    "there are no new parton - parton subprocesses that contribute at nlo but not at lo .",
    "thus a lo prediction , using the nlo cteq6.1 pdfs , will reproduce fairly closely the nlo calculation . for rapidities between @xmath65 and @xmath66 ,",
    "the @xmath132-factor is within @xmath133 of unity , dropping below one at higher transverse momentum . for forward rapidities ,",
    "the @xmath132-factor drops almost immediately below one , due to the behaviour of the high-@xmath54 pdfs that contribute to the cross section in this region .",
    "there is nothing wrong with the nlo prediction in this region ; its relationship to the lo cross section has just changed due to the kinematics .",
    "lo predictions in this region will provide an overestimate of the nlo cross section .",
    "we saw in section  [ sec : corrections ] that jets in the upper range of transverse momentum values at the tevatron were very collimated .",
    "this will be even more the case at the lhc , where in the multi - tev range , a large fraction of the jet s momentum will be contained in a single calorimeter tower .",
    "jet events at the lhc will be much more active than events in a similar @xmath1 range at the tevatron .",
    "the majority of the dijet production for the transverse momentum range less than @xmath65  tev will be with a @xmath74 initial state . as discussed previously , the larger colour factor associated with the gluon and the greater phase space available at the lhc for gluon emission will result in an increased production of additional soft jets .",
    "in addition , there is an increased probability for the production of `` mini - jets '' from multiple - parton scattering among the spectator partons . at full design luminosity , on",
    "the order of @xmath134 additional minimum bias interactions will be present at each crossing .",
    "such events , either singly or in combination , may create additional jets . as a result",
    ", the minimum jet transverse momentum requirement may need to be increased for most analyses ; in addition , it may be advantageous to use smaller cone sizes than used for similar analyses at the tevatron .    as discussed above",
    ", the lhc will produce jets at transverse momenta far larger than the @xmath38 mass .",
    "thus , virtual electroweak corrections of the form @xmath135 , where @xmath136 , may become important . for example , at @xmath137  tev , @xmath138 .",
    "these double logs are a result of the lack of cancellation between real and virtual @xmath38 emission in higher order calculations and may become competitive in size with nlo qcd corrections . the impact of a subset of the full ew corrections ( i.e. those involving virtual electroweak boson emission only ) reaches of the order of @xmath139 at @xmath105  tev , as shown in figure  [ fig : lhc_logs ] below  @xcite .",
    "this is an indication that all standard model corrections , and not just those from higher order qcd , need to be understood in order to correctly interpret any new physics that may be present at the lhc .",
    "the lhc will present an unprecedented potential for the discovery of new physics .",
    "thus , it is even more important to understand both the possible production mechanisms for the new physics and the standard model backgrounds for their signals .",
    "the experiences gained at the tevatron , and the phenomenological tools developed in the last few years , will serve as a basis towards the establishment of the relevant standard model benchmarks at the lhc . in this paper , we have put together a primer to aid this establishment .    for convenience ,",
