    "wireless sensor networks are used for detection or classification , whether for surveillance , environmental monitoring , or any of the myriad other application domains that are emerging in the age of big data . in many such applications , the likelihood functions of the hypotheses , e.g. ,  the presence or absence of a particular physical phenomenon ,",
    "are not known before the sensor network is deployed ; in these applications , the sensor network requires training prior to operation via supervised learning @xcite .",
    "the resulting classification accuracy improves with the number of measurements taken during training  @xcite , but increasing length of the training stage further reduces the limited battery capacity for the operational stage .",
    "therefore , the amount of resources expended during training mediates operational lifetime and accuracy of the sensor network . the energy consumption of sensor nodes , and thus the lifetime of the network , is dominated by energy expended on communication .",
    "node transmissions in wireless sensor networks are commonly regulated by the carrier - sense multiple - access ( csma ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this algorithm is implemented in tinyos , a popular open source operating system for wireless sensor networks , and is part of the ieee 802.15.4 standard for wireless sensor network communication @xcite .",
    "nodes using csma access the medium in a distributed manner , and wait some random back - off time between successive transmissions .    in this paper",
    "we consider a scenario where a set of measurements and classification is required every time unit .",
    "only nodes that are active at that time perform a measurement and transmit the result , so the number of measurements collected varies over time . we develop and analyze a model of sensor networks that perform supervised classification _ in situ _ , using the fisher discriminant analysis ( fda ) learning algorithm , with a training stage and an operational stage enabled by csma .",
    "the specific analysis of focus is the relationship between operational accuracy and lifetime , which we show to be of a fundamentally different character than for the case of detection with known likelihood functions , due to overfitting . in characterizing operational classification accuracy ( in contrast to classification accuracy on training samples ) , we make use of generalization approximations for fda developed by raudys et al .  @xcite .",
    "battery capacity is characterized by the number of transmissions ( and thus measurements ) that can be performed , whether they be during training or operation . as every measurement corresponds to one transmission",
    ", the expected network lifetime is inversely proportional to the node throughput in our model .",
    "the performance measures of interest are the classification accuracy and operational lifetime , which is the lifetime spent in the operational stage , not in the training stage .",
    "the two main parameters available for configuring the sensor network are the csma back - off rates ( the reciprocal of the mean back - off time ) , and the fraction of the lifetime spent in the training stage .    as the back - off rates of the nodes increase , states with many actively transmitting nodes are more likely .",
    "this requires more energy consumption , and also affect classification accuracy .",
    "classification accuracy is not monotonically increasing in the number of active nodes due to the phenomenon of overfitting , as we discuss in @xcite .",
    "we also show that operational accuracy as a function of back - off rate exhibits the hallmarks of overfitting in one regime , but in another regime , has a behavior quite different than any behavior usually encountered in statistical learning @xcite .",
    "the analysis of supervised classification for sensor networks in the researcg literature is limited @xcite : investigations have been predominantly concerned with the detection case where the likelihood functions are known",
    ". moreover , sensor network research tends to separate learning issues from the communication aspect .",
    "there are several works that model csma communication in sensor networks generally , e.g.  @xcite and references therein , but not with the supervised classification application as part of the formulation .",
    "cross - layer work that does consider the networking issues together with a detection or estimation application , e.g. ,  the correlation - based collaborative mac protocol @xcite , is again focused on the case with known likelihoods .",
    "so although fda and the performance of csma - like algorithms has been widely studied in the research literature , we are the first to jointly consider classification accuracy and communication aspects of wireless sensor networks .",
    "we consider both the case of statistically independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "measurements from different nodes , and the case of measurements exhibiting correlation that depends on the spatial distance between the nodes .",
    "having i.i.d .",
    "measurements is a common simplifying assumption in wireless sensor network detection @xcite .",
    "a model with spatially - correlated measurements is much closer to reality in most applications @xcite .",
    "we assume that the learning algorithm has no prior information on the distribution and correlation of the measurements ; the fda has to estimate means and covariances as part of the training stage .",
    "the spatial correlation is encoded via a gauss  markov random field ( gmrf ) model .",
    "the csma model under consideration was first introduced in the 1980s in the context of packet radio networks  @xcite and was later applied to networks based on the ieee 802.11 standard  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been used to study so - called adaptive csma algorithms , where the back - off rate of the nodes changes with their congestion level  @xcite .",
    "although the representation of binary exponential back - off mechanism in the above - mentioned models is far less detailed than in the landmark work of bianchi  @xcite and similar results focusing on sensor networks , e.g. ,  @xcite , the general interference graph offers greater versatility and covers a broad range of topologies .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fda ] , we describe the setup of the sensor network system from the fda supervised classification perspective and in section  [ sec : csma ] , we describe the setup of the sensor network system from the csma communication perspective . in section",
    "[ sec : relation ] we derive the relationship between operational lifetime and accuracy , and section  [ sec : example ] presents numerical results of lifetime and accuracy for two special cases , illustrating the complicated balancing act that is involved .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] provides a discussion and several ideas for future directions of research .",
    "consider a sensor network consisting of @xmath0 sensor nodes each taking a scalar measurement combined into a joint measurement vector @xmath1 . in the general",
    "supervised classification problem , we are given @xmath2 sample pairs @xmath3 known as the training set , with measurement @xmath4 and the class label or hypothesis @xmath5 .",
    "the training samples are acquired by the network after deployment and before the operational stage .",
    "the availability of labels for the training measurements is an assumption made in @xcite as well .",
    "once the training set is acquired , the samples are used to learn a classification function or decision rule @xmath6 that will accurately classify new unseen and unlabeled samples @xmath7 from the same distribution from which the training set was drawn .    in this paper , we focus on a simple , classical decision rule @xmath8 , the fisher discriminant analysis classifier @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the conditional sample means and covariances of the @xmath2 training samples . the fisher discriminant analysis rule is a plug - in classifier that follows from the likelihood ratio test for optimal signal detection between gaussian signals with the same covariance and different means .",
    "the rule is applied in the operational stage of the sensor network to classify new observations .    given the fda decision rule , we would like to characterize its performance , specifically its classification accuracy as it generalizes to new unseen samples in the operational stage .",
    "generalization accuracy , however , is a functional of the underlying data distribution @xmath15 , and we must first specify a probability distribution of the sensor measurements .",
    "we employ the same gmrf statistical model for sensor measurements as @xcite .",
    "that is , the @xmath0 sensor nodes are deployed on the plane with spatial locations @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the likelihoods of the two hypotheses are gaussian : @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the prior probabilities of the hypotheses are equal : @xmath20 = \\pr[\\mathssf{y } = 1 ] = 1/2 $ ] . for simplicity of exposition @xmath21 ( the vector of all zeroes ) and @xmath22 ( the vector of all ones ) .",
    "the covariance structure is based on the euclidean nearest neighbor graph of the sensors : the ( undirected ) nearest neighbor graph contains an edge between sensor @xmath23 and sensor @xmath24 if sensor @xmath23 is the nearest neighbor of sensor @xmath24 or if sensor @xmath24 is the nearest neighbor of sensor @xmath23 .",
    "the set of edges in the nearest neighbor graph is denoted @xmath25 .",
    "the diagonal elements of @xmath26 are all equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the elements of @xmath26 corresponding to edges in the nearest neighbor graph are : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a decreasing function that encodes correlation decay with distance .",
    "the inverse covariance matrix @xmath30 is used to specify the remaining elements .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath31 corresponding to sensor pairs @xmath32 that do not have an edge in the nearest neighbor graph are zero , i.e. @xmath33 we also consider the case of i.i.d .",
    "observations in the paper , in which case @xmath34 for @xmath35 and @xmath36 otherwise .",
    "a highly accurate approximation of generalization accuracy @xmath37 $ ] for the fda decision rule as described above is found in @xcite .",
    "based on @xcite , this approximation is given as @xmath38^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\right ) , \\quad m > n,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the gaussian cumulative distribution function and @xmath40 is known as the mahalanobis distance @xmath41 in case @xmath42 there are insufficient training samples for accurate classification and we have @xmath43 . in the i.i.d .",
    "case , @xmath44 simplifies to @xmath45 .",
    "the csma algorithm is an example of a random - access algorithm , where nodes decide for themselves when to transmit , based on local information only .",
    "we assume that the @xmath46 nodes share the wireless medium according to a csma - type protocol .",
    "the network is described by an undirected conflict graph @xmath47 , where the set of vertices @xmath48 represents the nodes of the network and the set of edges @xmath49 indicates which pairs of nodes can not activate simultaneously .",
    "for ease of presentation we assume that the conflict graph is the same as the nearest neighbor graph introduced in section  [ sec : fda ] .",
    "nodes that are neighbors in the conflict graph are prevented from simultaneous activity by the carrier - sensing mechanism .",
    "an inactive node is said to be blocked whenever any of its neighbors is active , and unblocked otherwise .",
    "the transmission times of node  @xmath23 are independent and exponentially distributed with unit mean .",
    "when node  @xmath23 is blocked it remains silent until all its neighbors are inactive , at which point it tries to activate after an exponentially distributed back - off time with mean @xmath50 .",
    "the set @xmath51 of all feasible joint activity states of the network in this case corresponds to the incidence vectors of all independent sets of the conflict graph .",
    "let the network state at time  @xmath52 be denoted by @xmath53 , with @xmath54 indicating whether node  @xmath23 is active at time  @xmath52 ( @xmath55 ) or not ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "then @xmath57 is a markov process which is fully specified by the state space @xmath51 and the transition rates @xmath58 here @xmath59 denotes the vector of length @xmath46 with all zeroes except for a 1 at position @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath60 is reversible ( see  @xcite ) , the following product - form stationary distribution @xmath61 exists : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the normalization constant that makes @xmath61 a probability measure .    the rate @xmath64 at which sensor node  @xmath23 makes observations ( or , alternatively , the rate at which it does transmissions ) is referred to as the throughput of this node , and may be written as @xmath65 sensor nodes rely on batteries for energy , and we assume that all nodes have a battery that allows them to make @xmath66 transmissions each before their battery is drained .",
    "consequently , the expected lifetime of a node can be written as @xmath67 the activity process in the training stage is the same as in the operational stage .",
    "we denote by @xmath68 the fraction of the battery capacity that is dedicated to training the sensor network . so the testing lifetime of node  @xmath23 is @xmath69 , and the operational lifetime ( the quantity we would like to be large ) is : @xmath70    the model we have specified is fully general for any @xmath0-node conflict graph .",
    "we work with this general model throughout the remainder of the paper , but also focus on two illustrative special cases .",
    "the two special cases of the csma network we consider are an @xmath0-node network where all networks are disjoint and a three - node linear network .",
    "first , consider an @xmath0-node network where all nodes can be active simultaneously .",
    "this corresponds to an interference graph with an empty edge set @xmath71 .",
    "we have @xmath72 and set @xmath73 so the stationary distribution   simplifies to @xmath74 the stationary probability of any particular state only depends on the number of active nodes in that state and on the back - off rate @xmath75 .",
    "thus , for notational convenience , we introduce @xmath76 as the stationary probability of being in any state with @xmath77 active nodes , and we write @xmath78 which follows since there are @xmath79 different activity states with @xmath77 nodes transmitting .    with equal back - off rates and disjoint nodes ,",
    "the stationary throughput   is the same for all nodes @xmath80 moreover , all nodes have the same lifetime , and the operational lifetime of the network may be written as @xmath81",
    "consider the three - node network where the nodes are positioned such that the carrier - sensing mechanism prevents node  2 from activating while either node 1 or node 3 is active . nodes 1 and 3 can be active simultaneously , but their observations are correlated .",
    "the network can take five possible states @xmath82 using   we compute the following stationary probabilities : @xmath83    in order to make sure that all nodes have the same throughput and lifetime , we fix some parameter @xmath84 and choose @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "so node  2 has a shorter mean back - off time in order to compensate for its disadvantageous position in the network , and all nodes have throughput ( see  @xcite ) @xmath87 and operational lifetime @xmath88 the normalization constant with these back - off rates is given by @xmath89",
    "we are now in position to combine the fda model from section  [ sec : fda ] and the csma model presented in section  [ sec : csma ] to derive the relationship between generalization accuracy and operational lifetime .",
    "this is mediated by two parameters : the back - off rate @xmath75 or @xmath90 and the fraction of the lifetime spent in the training stage @xmath91 .",
    "due to the interference constraints and the intermittent nature of csma communications , not all nodes produce and validly communicate measurements at all times .",
    "so the training samples are acquired under different activity states @xmath92 . thus studying the relationship between accuracy and lifetime",
    "is not simply a matter of joining the corresponding expressions   and  .",
    "this issue of incomplete data due to the activity process can be addressed in several ways , including data imputation @xcite .",
    "although various elaborate schemes are available , they come at the cost of additional computation , communication , and coordination that are at a premium in the sensor network setting . instead , we choose to model the classification by having separately learned classifiers for different activity states . in the operational stage",
    "the appropriate classifier is used for prediction based on the activity state of the measurements . in this setup ,",
    "we associate with each state @xmath93 a number of training samples @xmath94 then we compute the overall generalization accuracy as the weighted sum of the individual generalization accuracies for each pattern according to their stationary probabilities : @xmath95^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath61 the stationary distribution   and @xmath96 as in  .",
    "we now compute the generalization accuracies for the two special cases introduced in section  [ sec : csma ] with the gmrf of the measurements having the same graph structure as the csma network .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : csma ] for a set of @xmath0 disjoint nodes , all patterns with @xmath77 active nodes have the same stationary probability @xmath76 given in , and all nodes have equal throughput   and lifetime  .",
    "we denote by @xmath97 the number of training samples for patterns with @xmath77 active nodes , and by summing   over all states with @xmath77 active nodes , we write @xmath98 as discussed in section  [ sec : fda ] , with i.i.d .",
    "measurements from @xmath0 sensors , the squared mahalanobis distance is @xmath45 .",
    "thus , with @xmath77 active sensors , the squared mahalanobis distance is @xmath99 . substituting the expression for the stationary distribution   and the number of training samples   into the expression for the generalization accuracy   we obtain @xmath100^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\right).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]      recall from section  [ sec : three - node ] that the three - node network has 5 feasible states .",
    "the four non - empty states have squared mahalanobis distance @xmath101 note that since @xmath102 , the mahalanobis distance of the larger state is larger than that of the states with only one node active , and is more valuable .",
    "evaluating   we obtain an expression for the number of training samples for each state : @xmath103    by weighting the individual generalization accuracies  , we obtain @xmath104^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}}\\right ) + \\\\",

    "in section  [ sec : relation ] we derived the operational lifetime @xmath105 , the number of training samples @xmath106 and the operational classification accuracy @xmath107 for a wireless sensor network with random - access communication as a function of the back - off rate @xmath75 and the fraction of the lifetime spent in training @xmath91 .",
    "here we numerically evaluate these quantities for the special cases of independent nodes and the three - node linear network .",
    "we include a comparison to the bayes optimal detector with known likelihood functions and see that the accuracy behavior is markedly different .",
    "additionally , we see that there are two different regimes in the accuracy behavior as a function of the back - off rate , the second regime different than that usually seen in statistical learning .",
    "the overall behavior is unique due to the combination of csma and fda .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath108 independent nodes with @xmath109 transmissions allowed by the battery per node .",
    "the sensor measurement noise variance is set to @xmath110 .",
    "other parameter settings produce qualitatively similar results .",
    "first , in fig .  [ fig : indep_unu ] , we plot the operational lifetime @xmath105 as a function of the back - off rate @xmath75 for a fixed lifetime fraction devoted to training : @xmath111 .",
    "the non - monotonicity of the classification accuracy in the back - off rates makes an analytic approach to optimization difficult , and an alternative solution would be to approximate the expression for the detection accuracy   with some convex function .",
    "this would reduce the complexity of numerical optimization , and may even allow for analytical results .",
    "the effect of overfitting for medium back - off rates can be mitigated by choosing different back - off rates of the training stage and operational stage .",
    "for example , choosing larger back - off rates during training should increase the number of samples for states with many active nodes , thus reducing the risk of overfitting .",
    "although this would simultaneously reduce the number of samples for smaller states , the risk of overfitting is not as high there due to the smaller number of active nodes .    another direction for future",
    "research is to model temporal correlation in the sensor measurements in addition to spatial correlation . in the present work ,",
    "successive measurements in time are assumed independent , but including temporal correlation is more realistic @xcite . if temporal correlation is part of the sensing and classification model , its interaction with the temporal back - off mechanism may produce quite interesting phenomena . a markov model for temporal correlation could be analyzed together with the markov activity process of the csma model .",
    "finally , we also mention that asymptotic analysis is of interest in the future study of this cross - layer supervised learning and random - access communication setup .",
    "developing expressions for the three - node dependent network , e.g. , and , requires us to keep track of many details ; larger networks will require us to keep track of many more . by performing an asymptotic analysis of an increasing number of randomly placed sensor nodes with constant density in @xcite ,",
    "we are able to eliminate many such details in the sensor network generalization error using geometric probability @xcite . having now set forth this extended model with csma communication , similar asymptotic analysis using geometric probability is certainly warranted .",
