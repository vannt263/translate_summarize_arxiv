    "the first generation of stars , or the so - called population iii.1 stars ( pop iii.1 stars ; oshea et al . 2008 ) , are formed out of the primordial pristine gas with a small ionization degree ( @xmath5 ) left from the cosmic recombination ( peebles 1968 ; sasaki & takahara 1993 ) . within minihalos with @xmath6 ,",
    "the collapse of primordial clouds is induced by the h@xmath7 cooling , which sets a characteristic mass - scale of dense cores at several @xmath8 ( bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ; abel , bryan , & norman 2002 ) . inside these cores",
    ", protostars eventually form as a result of further graviational collapse by the h@xmath7 cooling ( omukai & nishi 1998 ; yoshida , omukai , & hernquist 2008 ) .",
    "although the exact value of final stellar mass is still elusive , it is speculated that the stars grow massive ( @xmath9 several @xmath10 ) owing to combined effects of high accretion rate and low opacity in primordial gas ( omukai & palla 2003 ; bromm & loeb 2004 ; mckee & tan 2008 ; hosokawa et al .",

    "stars formed under influences of radiative / mechanical feedbacks from pre - existing stars are expected to have a different characteristic mass - scale from that of the pop iii.1 stars , and thus the terminology of pop iii.2 stars have been proposed to specify them ( oshea et al .",
    "2008 ) . among various feedback mechanisms , e.g. ,",
    "photodissociation by the stellar far - ultraviolet radiation ( omukai 2001 ; oshea & norman 2008 ) , the sweeping by supernova blast waves ( mackey , bromm , & hernquist 2003 ; salvaterra , ferrara , & schneider 2004 ; machida et al . 2005 ) , one of the most well - studied is the case of star formation in relic hii regions of the first stars ( oshea et al .",
    "2005 ; nagakura & omukai 2005 ; machida , omukai & matsumoto 2009 ) .",
    "the massive first stars ionize the surrounding material by uv radiation ( e.g. , kitayama et al .",
    "2004 ) . except two ranges ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) in mass",
    ", they end their lives rather quietly without supernova explosions ( heger & woosley 2002 ; umeda & nomoto 2002 ) . in those relic hii regions ,",
    "the recombination proceeds in timescale @xmath13 yrs and the gas condenses again to form next - generation stars ( yoshida et al .",
    "such pre - ionized primordial - gas follows a different thermal evolution from the pristine primordial gas of pop iii.1 star formation ( uehara & inutsuka 2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ) . in the pre - ionized gas ,",
    "more h@xmath7 ( with molecular fraction @xmath14 ) than in the pristine gas ( @xmath15 ) forms via the electron - catalyzed reaction , @xmath16 and thus its cooling lowers the temerature below the minimum attainable in the pristine gas ( @xmath17 200k ) .",
    "in such a cold gas , hd fractionation is strongly favored via the exothermic ( with energy difference @xmath18k ) reaction @xmath19 and the resultant hd cooling further lowers the temperature to a few tens k , close to the cmb temperature in the high - redshift universe , @xmath20 . those hd - cooling clouds fragment into dense cores of a few 10@xmath21 , which bear stars at their centers incorporating a large part of the material in the cores ( yoshida , omukai & hernquist 2007 ; mcgreer & bryan 2008 ) .",
    "namely , the history of ionization in a low - density medium , or `` pre - ionization '' , has a large effect on the subsequent thermal evolution of the metal - free gas , and possibly changes the characteristic stellar mass .    for metal - enriched clouds ,",
    "the pre - ionization effect has not been explored comprehensively so far .",
    "some previous studies , though , indicate that it has indeed effects on the thermal evolution at least in some range of metallicity .",
    "for example , in the initially un - ionized cases with metallicity [ z / h ] @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mass fraction of metals in the medium .",
    "] cooling by fine - structure transitions of carbon and oxygen lowers the temperature below the minimum value attainable solely by the h@xmath7 cooling in the pristine gas ( @xmath17 200k at @xmath25 ) ( omukai 2000 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ) . on the other hand , from the pre - ionized initial condition ,",
    "the minimum temperature attainable does not change so much from that in the primordial gas even for metallicity as much as [ z / h]@xmath26 ( jappsen et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the pre - ionization effect in the metal - free gas is largely due to the hd formation and cooling .",
    "hd is also known to be quite susceptible to irradiation of fuv as well as ionization by the cosmic rays .",
    "for example , even in the pre - ionized gas , existence of only a weak fuv field prevents hd formation and its cooling ( yoshida , omukai , & hernquist 2007b ; wolcott - green & haiman 2010 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "a certain amount of cosmic - ray ( cr ) irradiation ( with a few % of the energy density in the present - day galactic disk ) enables hd formation / cooling in an initially un - ionized cloud ( stacy & bromm 2007 ) .    in this paper , we study whether the pre - ionization affects the subsequent thermal evolution of low - metallicity clouds under a variety of intensities of the external fuv and cr fields",
    ". we also aim to clarify the density range where the thermal evolution is influenced by the external fuv and cr irradiation .",
    "the current prefered theory expects that transition from the pop iii massive star formation mode to the pop ii / i low - mass star mode is caused by the modification of thermal evolution due to the accumulation of metals in the star - forming gas , albeit the exact value of the critical metallicity is still in dispute ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ; dopcke et al .",
    "however , if the influences of environmental parameters , e.g. , pre - ionization or external radiation fields , remain until high density where the fragmentation and low - mass core formation occur , we also need to care about those parameters in studying fragmentation properties of low - metallicity clouds and thus the problem would become highly complex .    our calculations here , fortunately , revealed that the pre - ionization alters the thermal evolution only in low density except cases with very low - metallicity ( [ z / h ] @xmath27 ) and under the low - fuv ( @xmath28)/cr fields ( @xmath29 of the present - day galactic disk levels ) .",
    "in addition , with a given metellicity , all the temperature evolution tracks with diffrent fuv / cr intensities converge before the density range where efficient cooling by dust triggers the cloud fragmentation .",
    "this demonstrates that in studying evolution of the dense cores , we need not care about the past ionization history except in the limited circumstances .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we describe the method of calculation and input physics in our model . in sec . 3 ,",
    "the results for temperature evolution of low - metallicity clouds are presented and analysed . finally , in sec . 4",
    ", we conclude the paper by summarizing our findings .",
    "we calculate the thermal evolution of low - metallicity clouds by using a one - zone model , which is based on that by omukai ( 2000 ) and omukai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but with some modifications , including ( i ) chemical reaction network and its rate coefficients are updated and ( ii ) effects of fuv and cr irradiation , specifically , heating by photoelectric emission of dust grains and by cr ionization , and photo- and cr - induced chemical reactions , are added .",
    "the physical quantities , i.e. , temperature , density , chemical fraction , etc . , calculated in this model are regarded as those at the center of the cloud .",
    "the quantities calculated by this model are known to reproduce well the central evolution by hydrodynamical calculations for low - metallicity clouds ( omukai , hosokawa , & yoshida 2010 ) as well as for primordial clouds under fuv irradiation ( shang , bryan , & haiman 2010 ) .    without strong magnetic or turbulent supports , the dynamical collapse of self - gravitating clouds",
    "is well described by the larson - penston type similarity solution ( larson 1969 ; penston 1968 ) . during the collapse ,",
    "the cloud developes the core - envelope structure with homogeneous central region of nearly the jeans length in size and the envelope where the density decreases with radius as @xmath30 . by mimicking the above property of the larson - penston solution",
    ", we assume the density increases by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of the gas , and the collapse timescale @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the ratio of pressure gradient to gravity and given as a function of the effective equation of state ( see omukai et al .",
    "the temperature evolution is followed by solving the energy equation : @xmath35 where the specific thermal energy is written as @xmath36 with the ratio of specific heat @xmath37 , the temperature @xmath38 , and the mean molecular weight @xmath39 , and , on the right - hand side , @xmath40 is the pressure @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the net cooling rate per unit mass .",
    "the cooling processes included in @xmath42 are the radiative cooling by the h ly@xmath43 transition , fine - structure line transitions of [ cii ] , [ ci ] , and [ oi ] , and rotational ( and also vibrational for h@xmath7 ) transitions of molecules h@xmath44 , hd , co , oh , and h@xmath7o . in calculating the h@xmath7 cooling rate , we also include the h@xmath7-e and h@xmath7-h@xmath45 collisional transitions in addition to the h@xmath7-h and h@xmath7-h@xmath7 collisions since , in a highly ionized gas , collisions with electrons and protons can potentially dominate the h@xmath7 excitation ( glover & abel 2008 ) .",

    "the heating rates by photoelectric emission of dust grains and by cr ionization are taken from wolfire et al .",
    ".    the chemical reactions among species composed of elements h , he , c , and o are solved .",
    "we consider the following 50 species as in omukai et al.(2005 ) : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "( 2007 ) , we take those involving the above 50 species only , but excluding the collider reactions , which become important only in higher density than our calculated range . for overlapping reactions between the two compilations , we use the rate coefficient presented in glover & abel ( 2008 ) .",

    "the temperature begins to fall down when the h@xmath7 self - shielding against the photodissociation becomes effective for [ z / h]@xmath142 . with high enough metallicity [ z / h]@xmath143 , the fine - structure - line cooling causes the temperature decrease before the h@xmath7 is self - shielded .    as discussed in sec .",
    "3.1 , without an fuv field , the thermal evolution of low - metallicity gas ( [ z / h ] @xmath27 ) bifurcates according to its initial ionization state .",

    "with higher fuv intensity ( @xmath145 ) , however , the temperatures in un - ionized and pre - ionized cases quickly converge each other during the initial temperature - decreasing phase .",
    "the dependence on the initial ionization state immediately disappears . this is because sufficient hd for cooling is not formed in either un - ionized nor pre - ionized case : even in the pre - ionized cases , h@xmath7 photodissociation by fuv field prevents the gas to cool @xmath146 150k , thereby quenching hd formation , which proceeds only in the low - temperature environments . for [ z / h ] @xmath147 , as in no uv cases , the minimum temperatures are the same for pre-/ un - ionized cases and no effect of pre - ionization",

    "the cosmic - ray ionization as high as @xmath161 in terms of the primary ionization rate , or @xmath162 of the solar neiborhood level , enables hd formation / cooling even in the un - ionized gas , thereby eliminating the pre - ionization effects even in very low - metallicity cases .",
    "the convergence of thermal evolution at high density has important consequence on the mass - scale of forming stars . in the framework of dynamical fragmentation , clouds fragments during efficient cooling phase , where the temperature decreases with density , while fragmentation hardly occurs in the temperature - increasing phase ( larson 1985 , 2005 ; li et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the characteristic fragmentation mass - scales are thus set by the jeans mass at the local minima of temperature .",

    "since the location of the first lower - density temperature minimum is vulnerable to the external fuv radiation , the fragmentation mass - scale owing to the line cooling can vary from cloud to cloud depending on the intensity of surrounding fuv field . on the other hand , as the temperature evolution depends neither on the pre - ionization nor external fuv radiation for @xmath169 , the location of the temperature minimum by the dust cooling is robust .",

    "<S> we study effects of the fully ionized initial state , or pre - ionization , on the subsequent thermal evolution of low - metallicity clouds under various intensities of the external far - ultraviolet(fuv ) and cosmic - ray(cr ) fields . </S>",
    "<S> the pre - ionization significantly affects the thermal and dynamical evolution of metal - free clouds without fuv / crs by way of efficient hd formation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the pre - ionization effect on the thermal evolution is limited in very low - density regime for more metal - enriched clouds ( [ z / h ] @xmath0 ) or those under modest fuv ( @xmath1 ) or cr field ( @xmath2 of the present - day galactic disk levels ) . in any case , for @xmath3 , neither the initial ionization state nor the irradiating fuv strength affect the thermal evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the dust cooling is an important mechanism for making sub - solar mass fragments in low - metallicity gas . </S>",
    "<S> since this fragmentation occurs at the temperature minimum by the dust cooling at @xmath4 , this process is not vulnerable either to initial ionization state or external radiation . </S>"
