    "it was first noted in ref .",
    "therefore , in fact , these integrals can be easily taken . in the electrodynamics",
    "this can be partially explained by a method , based on substituting solutions of ward or slavnov  taylor identities into the schwinger ",

    "however , for a complete proof it is necessary to propose existence of a new identity for the green functions , which origin is so far unclear @xcite .",
    "a similar identity @xcite also appears in calculating a contribution of the matter superfields in a non - abelian theory .",
    "it exists because integrals , defining the two - point green function are reduced to total derivatives .",

    "because the fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not interact with the quantum gauge field , they contribute only to the one - loop ( including subtraction ) diagrams .",
    "it is important to note that the factor @xmath53 in action ( [ b_action ] ) is the same as in action for the gauge fixing terms ( [ gauge_fixing ] ) .",
    "the gauge fixing breaks the invariance of the action under the quantum gauge transformations ( [ quantum_transformations ] ) , but there is a remaining invariance under the brst - transformations .",
    "the brst - invariance leads to the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities , which relate vertex functions of the quantum gauge field and ghosts . however , all these fields are present only in loops",
    ". later we will introduce such a regularization that the brst - invariance is broken , but background invariance ( [ background_transformations ] ) remains unbroken . then a result of the calculation is surely gauge invariant ( in a sense of the invariance under the background gauge transformations ) .",
    "a more complicated question is if it is possible to construct the renormalized effective action , which satisfies the slavnov  taylor identities .",
    "a possibility of using noninvariant regularizations was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . according to these papers , to construct the effective action , satisfying the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities , it is necessary to use a special subtraction scheme , cancelling noninvariant terms in each order of the perturbation theory . with the background field method",
    "this scheme is slightly simplified , because the background gauge invariance guarantees , for example , the transversality of the two - point green function for the gauge field .",
    "nevertheless , as earlier , there are additional subtractions in the green functions , containing the ghost fields .    however , it is necessary to clear up if using this regularization affects the result of calculating the gell - mann  low function , which is investigated in this paper . to answer this question , as a starting point",
    "we will use the following statement : if we fix a normalization point @xmath54 and impose in this point the boundary condition for the renormalized two - point green function @xmath55 , then the two - point green function is uniquely determined and does not depend on both a way of renormalization and a regularization .",
    "for example , if two different regularizations are used , then    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the renormalized coupling constants at the scale @xmath6 , and the renormalized two - point green functions , obtained in the first and in the second regularization respectively . setting @xmath59 in eq .",
    "( [ d_equality ] ) it is possible to find the dependence @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , two different regularizations differ in a finite renormalization of the coupling constant .",
    "we note that such a renormalization can be gauge dependent and causes the gauge dependence of the effective action divergent part in a sufficiently large order of the perturbation theory .",
    "however , the gell - mann  low function , which we will calculate below in this paper , does not depend on such finite renormalization , because ( setting @xmath61 )    @xmath62    therefore , the gell - mann  low function does not depend on a regularization .",
    "in particular , a regularization can break the brst - invariance , provided the renormalized action is obtained by subtractions , restoring the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities .",
    "the gell - mann  low function is gauge independent , because the dependence of the rhs on the gauge is factorized to the gauge dependence of the @xmath1-function argument .",
    "therefore , using a regularization , breaking the brst - invariance , is possible . in particular",
    ", we will add the term    @xmath63    to action ( [ background_action ] ) .    proposed way of the regularization and gauge fixing preserves both invariance under the supersymmetry transformations and the invariance under transformations ( [ background_transformations ] ) . as a consequence , the effective action , calculated with the background field method , will be invariant under both supersymmetry and gauge transformations .",
    "we note that the regularization , described here , is different from a method , proposed in ref .",
