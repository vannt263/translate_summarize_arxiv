    "this paper reviews and extends previous work in which we derived the existence of an equity premium and the validity of a capital asset pricing model ( capm ) from a purely game - theoretic hypothesis of market efficiency , without assuming the existence of probabilities for security prices .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider only two securities , a stock @xmath0 and a traded market index @xmath1 .",
    "we also make the following simplifying assumptions :    * trading in @xmath0 and @xmath1 continues indefinitely .",
    "( the time horizon is infinite . ) * the prices of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are always positive and continuous . *",
    "the interest rate is zero .",
    "all these assumptions can be relaxed .",
    "our mathematical results have a practical interpretation if one adopts the hypothesis that the index @xmath1 is efficient , in the sense that a strategy for trading in @xmath0 and @xmath1 will not multiply the capital it risks by a factor many times larger than what would be achieved by buying and holding @xmath1 .",
    "we call this the _ efficient index hypothesis ( eih ) for @xmath1_.    a typical mathematical result in this paper asserts the existence of a trading strategy that will multiply the capital it risks by a factor many times larger than what would be achieved by buying and holding @xmath1 unless the price trajectories of @xmath0 and @xmath1 have a particular property .",
    "here are some properties we consider :    * @xmath1 grows at a rate determined by its volatility .",
    "( this is the equity premium . ) * @xmath1 has the properties of geometric brownian motion when time is appropriately rescaled .",
    "* @xmath0 obeys a capm with respect to @xmath1 .    in each case",
    ", we prove the existence of a trading strategy that beats @xmath1 by a large factor if the property does not hold .",
    "if you subscribe to the eih for @xmath1 , then you expect the property to hold .",
    "our eih is explained more fully in section  [ sec : eih ] , where we specify the trading strategies we consider , define an extended class of approximate capital processes ( supermartingales ) , and state the associated definition of upper probability .",
    "an upper probability measures how little initial capital must be risked to obtain unit capital if an event happens and thus how unlikely that event is .",
    "we study the index @xmath1 in sections  [ sec : existence-1][sec : epm ] . in section",
    "[ sec : existence-1 ] we define @xmath1 s cumulative growth rate and relative quadratic variation ; these exist in a strong sense under the eih : the trader can become infinitely rich as soon as they cease to exist . in sections",
    "[ sec : ep ] and  [ sec : epm ] we consider strategies for trading in @xmath1 and show that under the eih it grows at a rate determined by its relative quadratic variation .",
    "this growth is the equity premium .",
    "section  [ sec : existence-2 ] continues section  [ sec : existence-1 ] by defining quantities involving both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ sec : capm ] then derives a capm that relates these quantities to each other and includes most of our results about the equity premium as special cases .",
    "one purpose of this paper is to clarify the relation between two different methods that we used in previous work .",
    "we first established a probability - free capm fifteen years ago ; essentially , our version was the conjunction of a probability - free version of the standard capm and a probability - free expression for the equity premium .",
    "we did this first in discrete time @xcite , and then we extended the argument to continuous time using nonstandard analysis @xcite .",
    "the method used in those papers involved mixing , in a certain sense , the price paths of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( in the case of capm ) or mixing @xmath1 and cash ( in the case of the equity premium ) .",
    "ten years later , without using nonstandard analysis , one of us derived a probability - free version of the dubins ",
    "schwarz theorem @xcite , effectively reducing the probability - free setting to the bachelier model , which for positive prices becomes the black ",
    "scholes model after a time change . and",
    "the black  scholes model allows us to use standard probabilistic tools , including girsanov s theorem , to obtain a stronger form of our version of the capm @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply and compare the two methods , mixing @xcite and probabilistic @xcite , implementing them both without using nonstandard analysis . in section  [ sec : epm ] , we study the equity premium using the mixing method , and in section  [ sec : ep ] , we study it using the probabilistic method in combination with the probability - free dubins  schwarz theorem .",
    "the results from the probabilistic method are stronger than those from the mixing method , in the sense that they assert higher lower probabilities for the approximations formalizing the equity premium phenomenon , but the difference is not great . since the probability - free dubins ",
    "schwarz theorem is only applicable to one security , we can not apply the probabilistic method to the capm , which involves both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we use the mixing method to obtain our version of the capm in section  [ sec : capm ] .",
    "the sample space of this paper is the set @xmath2 of all pairs @xmath3 of positive continuous functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "each @xmath6 will be identified with the function @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 , @xmath9 . intuitively , @xmath1 is the price path of an index and @xmath0 is that of a stock or another financial security .",
