    "the wealth of high resolution data provided by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)@xcite@xcite has confirmed to very good approximation the standard cosmological picture , which predicts a statistically isotropic gaussian random cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations . despite this success ,",
    "several large - scale anomalies in the cmb have been reported including indications of non - gaussianity,@xcite@xcite evidences for a north - south asymmetry,@xcite and the so - called `` low-@xmath0 anomalies '' such as the surprisingly small values of the cmb quadrupole and octopole moments,@xcite and the alignment of the quadrupole and octupole moments,@xcite@xcite ( in this connection see ref .  )",
    "whose direction has been suggested to extend to the higher multipoles@xcite ( see also ref .   for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "in addition , there are also indications for a preferred axis of symmetry or directions of maximum asymmetry.@xcite@xcite    the possible origins of such unexpected anomalous features of cmb are at present the object of intense investigation , with several potential explanations , including unsubtracted foreground contamination and/or systematics,@xcite unconsidered local effects , @xcite other mechanisms to break statistical isotropy,@xcite and also extra - galactic origin ( see refs .  ,  ,   and   for details , and ref .   for recent related references ) . if they turn out to have a cosmological nature , however , they could have far reaching consequences for our understanding of the universe , in particular for the above - mentioned standard cosmological scenario .",
    "recently we proposed@xcite a new directional indicator @xmath1 , based on pair angular separation histogram ( pash),@xcite to measure large - angle anisotropy in the wmap data .",
    "an important feature of our indicator is that it can be used to generate a sky map of large - angles anisotropies from cmb temperature fluctuations maps .",
    "we have produced and studied in details @xmath2maps generated from the full - sky lilc,@xcite ` cleaned ' toh,@xcite and co - added@xcite wmap maps , and found a statistically significant preferred direction in these wmap maps , which agrees with the preferred asymmetry axes recently reported.@xcite these results were found to be robust with respect to the choice of the full - sky wmap cmb maps employed . however , since full - sky maps are known to have residual foreground contamination@xcite and complicated noise properties,@xcite their choice in the `` low-@xmath0 '' studies is not a consensus.@xcite thus , the question arises as to whether our results hold for cut - sky maps .",
    "our main aim here , which extends and complements our previous work,@xcite is to address this question by considering the lilc map with a kp2 sky cut . to this end , in the next section we give an account of our large - angle anisotropy indicator , while in the last section we apply our indicator to the lilc map with a kp2 sky cut , and present our main results and conclusions .",
    "for a detailed discussion of the indicator briefly presented in this section we refer the readers to ref .  .",
    "the key point in the construction of our indicator is that a homogeneous distribution of points on a two - sphere @xmath3 is seen by an observer at the center of @xmath3 as isotropically distributed , and therefore deviations from homogeneity in this distribution give rise to anisotropies for this observer .",
    "mutatis mutandis , since in cmb studies the celestial sphere is discretized into a set of equal size pixels , with a temperature fluctuation associated to each pixel , the idea in the cmb context is then to construct an indicator that measures deviation from homogeneity in the distribution of pixels with similar temperature .",
    "the first step towards the construction of this indicator is subdivide a given cmb map into a number of submaps , each consisting of equal number of pixels with similar temperatures .",
    "the next step is to devise an indicator to measure the deviation from a homogeneous distribution of these pixels .",
    "the construction of our indicator , @xmath1 is based on angular separation histograms ( pash ) , which are obtained by counting the number of pairs of pixels whose angular separation @xmath4 lies within small sub - intervals ( bins ) @xmath5 $ ] , of length @xmath6 , where @xmath7 \\ ; , \\quad   i=1,2 , \\dots , n_{bins}\\ ; , \\quad\\ ] ] with the bin centers at @xmath8 . the pash is then defined as the following normalized function @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total number of pixels in the submap , @xmath11 is the number of pairs of pixels with separation @xmath12 , and where the normalization condition @xmath13 holds .",
    "now , for a distribution of @xmath10 pixels in the sky sphere @xmath3 one can compute the expected number of pairs , @xmath14 with angular separation @xmath15 . from this quantity one",
    "obtains the normalized expected pair angular separation histogram ( epash ) , which is clearly given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total number of pairs of pixels , @xmath18 is the probability that a pair of objects can be separated by an angular distance that lies in the interval @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the corresponding probability density , and where the coefficient of the summation is a normalization factor .",
    "equation  ( [ defepash ] ) makes it clear that the epash @xmath21 gives the distribution of probability of finding pairs of points on the sky sphere with any angular separation @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "all angular separations @xmath23 are allowed , and the corresponding probability distribution can be calculated to give@xcite @xmath24 this is the limit of a statistically isotropic distribution of points in @xmath3 as the number of points go to infinity .",
    "one can thus quantify anisotropy by calculating the departure of the mean observed probability distribution @xmath25 from it , namely @xmath26 .",
    "] we denote the difference between the mean pash ( mpash ) , @xmath27 , calculated from the observational data , and the epash @xmath28 , obtained from an statistically isotropic distribution of pixels , as @xmath29 in practice , the expected @xmath28 for a statistically isotropic map is obtained simply by scrambling a cmb map multiple times , and averaging over the resulting histograms .",
    "lastly , to quantify anisotropy , we distill the histogram @xmath30 into a single number , by defining the indicator @xmath31 as the variance of @xmath32 ( which has zero mean ) , namely @xmath33    calculating @xmath34 for the whole celestial sphere would yield a global measure of anisotropy . to obtain a directional indicator",
    ", we can instead calculate both mpash and epash for spherical - shaped caps .",
    "the indicator @xmath34 can then be viewed as a ( non - local ) measure of the anisotropy in the direction of the center of the cap .",
    "thus , by construction , @xmath35 measures the deviation from isotropy in a given direction , i.e. how the observed distribution of points deviates from a statistically isotropic one .",
    "the epash for a cap of aperture @xmath36 can also be calculated in a closed form,@xcite but in practice one approximates @xmath37 by the mpash @xmath38 of the statistically isotropic distribution of pixels . ]    since @xmath34 is a discrete scalar function defined on @xmath3 , it can be expanded in spherical harmonics , and its power spectrum @xmath39 can be calculated , namely @xmath40 it then follows that if a large - angle asymmetry is present in the cmb temperature distribution , it should significantly affect the @xmath2map on the corresponding angular scales ( low-@xmath0 multipoles ) .    in the next section",
    ", we shall generate the @xmath2maps from lilc map with a kp2 sky cut , study its main features , and make a comparison with our previous results for the full - sky cmb maps.@xcite",
    "given that the large - scale angular correlations are nonlocal , @xmath41 , calculated over a @xmath42-radius cap centered at @xmath43 , can be though of as a measure of the anisotropy in the direction @xmath43 . in our previous",
    "work@xcite the strategy was to obtain @xmath34 for a set of 12,288 caps of radius @xmath42 co - centered with the same number of pixels generated by healpix with @xmath44 , evenly covering the entire celestial sphere .",
    "the resulting directional map of anisotropy was the so - called @xmath2map .",
    "we applied this new anisotropy indicator to three cmb wmap maps : the lilc@xcite and the toh@xcite maps ( which are two differently foreground cleaned full - sky maps resulting from the combination of the five frequency bands : k , ka , q , v , and w cmb maps measured by the wmap satellite ) , and the co - added map , which is a weighted combination of the q , v , and w wmap maps .",
    "the resulting @xmath2map were found to be anisotropic .",
    "briefly , there is a prominent spot with very high @xmath34 on the southeastern corner , with a well defined maximum at @xmath45 , which is close ( by @xmath46 ) to the direction recently indicated in ref .  .",
    "it was further shown ( by a standard spherical harmonics expansion ) that the lilc @xmath2map deviates from isotropy in a statistically significant way , with anomalously high ( @xmath47 cl ) dipole , quadrupole and octupole components ( see figs . 3 and 4 of ref .  ) .",
    "the higher components on the other hand fall within the expected values .",
    "this clearly indicates that the lilc map is not statistically isotropic .",
    "finally , we noted that the quadrupole component has a very peculiar shape , being very symmetric around an axis slightly off the galactic north - south .",
    "indeed , @xmath48 of the total power in @xmath49 comes from an axisymmetric component in the direction @xmath50 , somewhat close to the axes of symmetry of the temperature quadrupole and octupole found in ref .",
    "( about @xmath51 from both ) .    as previously mentioned , however , there is no consensus as to whether the full sky cleaned maps available are indeed free of significant galactic contamination .",
    "the question then arises as to whether one should study the full sky maps or confine the analysis to regions where such contamination is small .    in view of the lack of consensus on how to perform the data analysis",
    ", here we examine the robustness of our previous results by investigating the lilc map after the application of the kp2 mask ( hereafter the lilc - kp2 map ) , which discards the temperature fluctuations of 15.3% of the total number of pixels , mainly concentrated around the galactic plane .",
    "note that some of the caps with centers close to but outside the kp2 mask would still overlap with the mask itself .",
    "if the intersection region is too large the @xmath34 value would be largely an artifact os the masking procedure .",
    "on the other hand , if we were to exclude all caps were any overlapping occurs , we would lose information on over half of the sky . to achieve a balance , we shall disregard caps that obey either of the following criteria :    * have the cap center within the kp2 mask , and * have over @xmath52 of pixels within the kp2 mask .    with this critical value of @xmath52 for the maximum number of overlapping pixels typically the value of @xmath34 calculated for the same cap in both the lilc and lilc - kp2 maps differ by less than 10% .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , there is a spot of very high @xmath34 in the southeastern corner of the map , which coincides in both direction and magnitude with the one found in the full lilc @xmath2map.@xcite the fact that this spot lies well outside the region of significant galactic contamination suggests it is not the result of galactic contamination .",
    "the possibility remains , however , that it is caused by some unaccounted foreground contamination .",
    "such contamination however would unlikely to affect the different frequency bands in exactly the same way . to verify whether this is the case",
    ", we calculated the @xmath2map for the q , v and w bands separately , along with the co - added map@xcite , which is considered the most reliable map for cmb studies@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting maps are almost identical , supporting the result that foreground contamination may not account for the previously reported@xcite large scale anisotropy .     the @xmath2map for the lilc - kp2 map .",
    "this result was obtained by calculating @xmath34 for spherical caps with aperture @xmath53 , following the criteria outlined above.,width=226,height=124 ]     the @xmath2map for the wmap s q- , v- and w- bands , along with the combined co - added map , using the kp2 mask . in all maps the high @xmath34 value is apparent.,width=434,height=264 ]    several new smaller high @xmath34 spots are also in evidence near the mask region , but they are probably just artifacts of the masking procedure . as discussed in@xcite",
    "the main features of the resulting @xmath2map are robust with respect to the number of spherical caps used to cover the celestial sphere or the cap aperture @xmath54 .",
    "to obtain more quantitative information about the observed anisotropy , we followed the procedure of our previous work and calculated the power spectrum of the lilc - kp2 @xmath2map using the anafast subroutine in healpix@xcite .",
    "since we are now dealing with an incomplete sphere , the spherical harmonics are no longer orthogonal , and the values obtained must be handled with care .",
    "the @xmath55 values are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , along with the corresponding full sky values for comparison .",
    "it is clear that the dipole component of the @xmath2map is even larger for the lilc - kp2 than for the full sky lilc .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of an axis of asymmetry , again confirming our earlier results .",
    "the direction of the @xmath2map dipole changes , however , from @xmath56 in the full sky map to @xmath57 , in the lilc - kp2 map , a difference of @xmath58 .",
    "the quadrupole and octupole components on the other hand are comparatively smaller in the lilc - kp2 map , probably due to the fact that many of the high @xmath34 structures other than the large spot in the southeastern quadrant are now excluded by the kp2 mask .",
    "the power spectrum of the lilc - kp2 ( black dots ) and lilc ( grey dots ) @xmath2maps for @xmath59 . for comparison , the average @xmath2map power spectrum for a set of statistically isotropic full skies",
    "is shown ( solid curve within the grey band ) , along with its @xmath60 confidence limits ( dashed curves).,width=377,height=226 ]    another feature missing from the lilc - kp2 @xmath2map is the peculiar shape of the quadrupole component observed in the full sky map . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath48 of the total power in @xmath49 comes from an axisymmetric component in the direction @xmath50 , which may be related to the observed alignment of the temperature quadrupole and octupole .",
    "we have shown that a large scale anisotropy , roughly resembling an axis of asymmetry , remains a feature of the cmb sky even if the regions where galactic contamination is large are not taken into account .",
    "its essential dipolar nature in particular is a very robust feature , and is consistent with other axes reported in the literature obtained using different methods .",
    "this strongly suggests that either the observable universe is intrinsically anisotropic , or that there are other , subtler forms of foreground contamination that have not yet been taken into account . among the proposed explanations for the global preferred direction ,",
    "it has been suggested that it could be due to a non - trivial topology of the spatial section of the universe  @xcite ( for more details on cosmic topology see the review articles refs .  , and , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "if topology is indeed the origin , the indicator @xmath61 is promising in distinguishing between different topologies , as has been demonstrated by computer simulations in ref .  .",
    "these are very exciting possibilities , and are worthy of further investigation .",
    "we thank cnpq , pci - cbpf / cnpq , pci - inpe / cnpq - mct and pparc for the grants under which this work was carried out .",
    "we acknowledge use of the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) . some of the results in this paper have been derived using the healpix package .",

    "<S> thus , here we performed the same analysis for a map where regions with high foreground contamination were removed . </S>",
