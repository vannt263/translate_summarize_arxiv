    "modifications of gravity provide one way to explain the observed expansion of the universe .",
    "one such proposed theory is the _",
    "f(r ) _ class of models , which contain relatively simple modifications to general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "this particular model incorporates the chameleon mechanism  @xcite that screens the fifth force in high density regions while leaving it unscreened in low density regions , strengthening the force of gravity .    studying these underdense regions , called voids ,",
    "could provide a way to test _",
    "f(r ) _ gravity .",
    "already voids have been used as a potential diagnostic for examining other models , such as coupled dark energy  @xcite .",
    "so far , current void - based studies of modified gravity  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have only focused on predictions for present - day conditions and ignored realistic survey effects . in this work",
    ", we mimic upcoming galaxy redshift surveys such as euclid  @xcite and provide an initial estimate of the constraining power of void statistics .",
    "we analyzed six simulation realizations from @xcite .",
    "three models with differing values for structure formation in the universe , expressed by @xmath4 with values @xmath5 ( f4 ) , @xmath6 ( f5 ) , and @xmath7 ( f6 ) , were examined in addition to general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "each simulation box contained @xmath8 dark matter particles and had a cubic volume of 1.5 @xmath9gpc  per side . for analysis we selected snapshots at redshifts @xmath10 and @xmath11 and subsampled the dm particles to a mean density of @xmath12 per cubic @xmath9mpc .",
    "this choice of redshift , density , and volume is designed to represent a typical space - based galaxy survey such as euclid . finally , we perturbed particle positions according to their peculiar velocities .",
    "we chose to ignore the effects of galaxy bias , as @xcite demonstrated that watershed void properties are relatively insensitive to bias .",
    "voids were identified using the publicly available void identification and examination ( vide ) toolkit @xcite , which uses a substantially modified version of zobov @xcite . for this work , voids must be larger than the mean particle separation ( in our case , @xmath13@xmath9mpc ) and have central densities higher than 0.2 of the mean particle density @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : numberfunc ] shows the cumulative number function from @xmath1cdm   and _ f(r ) _ simulations at redshifts @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "we can see that f4 clearly contains larger voids than in the @xmath1cdm  simulation at both redshifts .",
    "with weaker coupling strengths , one will notice that at high redshift , f5 and f6 are not able to separate from gr . at lower redshift ,",
    "the f5 model becomes distinguishable at roughly the three sigma level from gr at radii as small as 35 @xmath9mpc .",
    "even the f6 model around 45 @xmath9mpc  separates from gr , albeit by a relatively small amount .",
    "the gain in large voids is balanced by a loss of small voids , implying that the fifth force is accelerating the dissipation of interior void walls .",
    "these features align with what one would reasonably expect to see from the @xmath15 models . at higher redshift ,",
    "the voids have not yet emptied out .",
    "until the local densities pass a low enough threshold , the fifth force will remain screened , making the @xmath15 models appear identical to gr .",
    "simultaneously , the modified gravity mechanism only affects particle acceleration , and so the differences grow larger with time .",
    "thus the strongest force , f4 , produces the greatest number of large voids .",
    "an initial fisher forecast places the constraint on measuring @xmath16 at roughly @xmath3 , indicating that for stronger fifth forces , a detection may well be possible , especially at lower redshift where there is more statistical power ."
