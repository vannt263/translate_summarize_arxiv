    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the top quark is predicted to decay almost exclusively to a @xmath1 boson and a @xmath3 quark , and the @xmath2 coupling is supposed to be purely v - a .",
    "however , physics beyond the sm could be visible in the top decays by changing the branching fraction of the top quark , or by altering the @xmath2 coupling",
    ". this would be the case for example with a fourth generation of quarks or supersymmetric particles .",
    "a precise measurement of the top and @xmath1 properties can be used to probe such models of new physics .",
    "we will first describe the extraction of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath0 .",
    "then we will present the measurement of the @xmath1 helicity , and the constraints on anomalous couplings at the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "the extraction of @xmath0can be done both from the @xmath4decays and the single top production . in the @xmath4decays , @xmath0can be extracted if the ckm matrix unitarity is assumed .",
    "since the single top production is directly proportional to @xmath0 , it can be extracted directly from the cross - section measurement without such assumptions , but the precision reached is lower because of the small statistics available .      using @xmath4events we can perform a measurement of @xmath5  which is defined as : @xmath6 where q = d , s , b .",
    "the extraction of @xmath0can be done by assuming @xmath7 .",
    "we then have : @xmath8 .",
    "the measurement has been performed recently at d0 with a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.4 fb@xmath9 , both in the semileptonic ( @xmath10+jets ) and dileptonic ( @xmath11 ) channels .",
    "the selected events contain high energetic jets ( at least 2 in the @xmath11 channel , at least 3 in the @xmath10+jets channel ) and lepton(s ) ( exactly one for @xmath10+jets and two for the @xmath11 channel ) . in the @xmath10+jets channel , an additional cut on the missing transverse energy",
    "is applied to reject the background , which is mostly composed of @xmath1+jets and multijet events . in the dilepton channel ,",
    "a topological selection is applied , based on the missing @xmath12 significance of the event , and the scalar sum of the transverse energies of the leptons and leading jet .",
    "the measurement relies on the identification of b - jets , which is done with a neural network algorithm ( nn ) using the impact parameters of the tracks associated to jets and the properties of secondary vertices . in the @xmath11 channel ,",
    "the nn is applied to the two leading jets , and the lowest output of the two is kept to build templates . in the @xmath10+jets channel ,",
    "the number of jets passing a cut on the nn output is counted .",
    "this requirement has an efficiency of 55 @xmath13 4@xmath14 for b - jets and of 1.5 @xmath13 0.1 @xmath14 for light jets .",
    "three decay modes of the @xmath4pair are simulated using pythia : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "templates are built for each of these decay channels and the background ( see figure  [ fig : templates ] ) , and data is fitted to the templates using a binned likelihood .",
    "a nuisance parameter approach is used to take into account the systematic uncertainties .    :",
    "number of identified b - jets in the @xmath10 + 3jets ( left ) and @xmath10 + 4 jets channels ( middle ) , and output of the b identification algorithm for the @xmath11 channel ( right ) . ]    the @xmath4production cross - section and @xmath5 were simultaneously extracted with this method .",
    "d0 obtains  @xcite : @xmath19 ( stat+syst ) pb and @xmath20 ( stat+syst ) . using the modified frequentist feldman - cousins method , the interval in @xmath0at",
    "the 95@xmath14 confidence level was derived : 0.90  @xmath21  0.99 .",
    "cdf obtained a result using a similar method with 160 pb@xmath9 of integrated luminosity  @xcite : @xmath22 ( stat ) @xmath23 ( syst ) , and @xmath24 0.78 at 95@xmath14 c.l .",
    "this measurement can be performed by assuming the sm single - top cross - sections , a branching fraction of @xmath25 of 1 and the v - a coupling at the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "the tevatron combination using results of d0 and cdf with 2.3 to 3.2 fb@xmath9 of luminosity yields  @xcite : + @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the 95@xmath14 c.l .",

    "the @xmath1 boson has three distincts polarizations : it can be longitudinal , left- or right - handed . because of",
    "the v - a coupling at the @xmath2 vertex and the small mass of the @xmath3 quark compared to the top quark mass , b - quarks from top decays are almost only left - handed . since the angular momentum is conserved at the vertex , almost no right - handed @xmath1 bosons are produced from a top decay . in the sm , the different helicity fractions",
    "are predicted to be : @xmath30 ( longitudinal ) , @xmath31 ( right - handed ) and @xmath32 ( left - handed )  @xcite . to measure these fractions ,",
    "two main methods are used : a template method and a matrix element method .",
    "the template method has been used by cdf in the @xmath11 channel with 5.1 fb@xmath9 and by d0 in the @xmath10+jets and @xmath11 channels with 5.4 fb@xmath9 .",
    "both measurements use the @xmath33 variable which is very sensitive to the helicity , and where @xmath34 is defined as the angle between the direction of the incoming top and the charged lepton or down - type quark in the @xmath1 rest - frame ( see figure  [ fig : wtemp ] ) .",

    "the probability for each event to correspond to a certain set of parameters ( @xmath35,@xmath36 ) is computed , by integrating over the pdf , the jet transfer functions , and the matrix element which is proportional to the helicity fractions .",

    "the most general lagrangian including operators up to dimension five can be written as : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the @xmath1 boson mass and four - momentum , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are left- and right - handed vector components ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are left- and right - handed tensor components ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . the sm predicts : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "two couplings are investigated simultaneously : @xmath57 and one of the anomalous ones , the others being set to zero .    for the single - top , multivariate discriminants ( bayesian neural networks ) have been used to distinguish between signals obtained from the different couplings .",
    "inputs to these discriminants are kinematic variables such as the lepton and jets four - vectors , the missing @xmath12 and b - tagging informations .",
