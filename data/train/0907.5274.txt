    "extra dimensional field theory and string theory with magnetic fluxes can lead to interesting models  @xcite .",

    "the number of zero modes , that is , the generation number , is determined by the magnitude of magnetic flux .",
    "their zero - mode profiles are non - trivially quasi - localized .",
    "such a behavior of zero - mode wavefunctions can lead to suppressed couplings when zero - modes are quasi - localized far away each other . that would be useful to realize e.g. suppressed yukawa couplings for light quarks and leptons .",
    "on the other hand , when their localized points are close to each other , their couplings would be of @xmath0 and that would be useful to explain e.g. the top yukawa coupling .",
    "furthermore , those localizing points on the torus background have a certain symmetry and it would become an origin of non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries  @xcite . furthermore , certain moduli can be stabilized by introducing magnetic fluxes  @xcite .",

    "magnetic backgrounds associated with orbifolds  @xcite and wilson lines can also derive several interesting aspects and some of them have been studied .",
    "effects of wilson lines on the torus with magnetic fluxes are gauge symmetry breaking and shift of wavefunction profiles .",

    "adjoint matter fields remain massless on the torus with magnetic fluxes , those are projected out on the orbifold  .",
    "these differences lead to phenomenologically interesting aspects  @xcite .",

    "we study zero - modes under such a background and their phenomenological aspects .",
    "section 4 is devoted to conclusion and discussion .",
    "here , let us study 6d field theory with magnetic fluxes and wilson lines .",
    "the two extra dimensions are compactified on @xmath1 , whose area and complex structure are denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we use the coordinates @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) for @xmath1 , while @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denote four dimensional uncompactified space - time , @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , we often use the complex coordinate , @xmath9 .",
    "the boundary conditions on @xmath1 are represented by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "first , let us study @xmath12 theory .",
    "we consider the fermion field @xmath13 with @xmath12 charge , @xmath14 , and it satisfies the dirac equation , @xmath15 with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denote the 6d gamma matrices and @xmath18 denote @xmath12 gauge vectors .",
    "the fermion field @xmath19 , the vector fields @xmath18 ( @xmath20 ) are decomposed as @xmath21 with @xmath5 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 correspond to 4d vector fields and scalar fields , respectively . here , the modes with @xmath24 correspond to zero - modes , while the others correspond to massive modes .",
    "since we concentrate on zero - modes , we omit the subscript corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the following form of magnetic flux on @xmath1 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an integer  @xcite",
    ". such magnetic flux can be obtained from the vector potential , @xmath27 this form of the vector potential satisfies the following relations , @xmath28 furthermore , these can be represented as the following gauge transformations , @xmath29 where @xmath30 then , the fermion field @xmath31 with the charge @xmath14 must satisfy @xmath32 here and hereafter , we use the @xmath12 charge normalization that all charges of matter fields are equal to integers and the minimum charge is @xmath33 .",
    "the internal part @xmath34 of the fermion zero - modes is two - component spinor , @xmath35 and we choose the gamma matrix for @xmath1 , @xmath36 then , the dirac equations for zero - modes become @xmath37    when @xmath38 , the component @xmath39 has @xmath40 independent zero - modes and their wavefunctions are written as @xcite @xmath41 \\left ( mz , m \\tau \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a normalization factor , @xmath43 denotes the flavor index , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 \\left ( \\nu , \\mu \\right )   & = &   \\sum_n \\exp\\left [ \\pi i     ( n+a)^2 \\mu + 2 \\pi i ( n+a)(\\nu + b)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , the jacobi theta - function . note that @xmath46 .",
    "they satisfy the orthonormal condition , @xmath47 furthermore , for @xmath38 , the other component @xmath48 has no zero - modes . as a result",
    ", we can realize a chiral spectrum .    on the other hand , when @xmath49 , the component @xmath48 has @xmath50 independent zero - modes , but the other component @xmath39 has no zero - modes .",
    "one of important properties of zero - mode wavefunctions is that we can decompose a product of two zero - mode wavefunctions as follows  @xcite , @xmath51    now , let us introduce wilson lines .",
    "the dirac equations of the zero - modes are modified by the wilson line background , @xmath52 as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are real constants .",
    "that is , we can introduce the wilson line background , @xmath52 by replacing @xmath56 in ( [ eq : chi ] ) as  @xcite @xmath57 because of this wilson line , the number of zero - modes does not change , but their wavefunctions are replaced as @xmath58    in general , yukawa couplings are computed by the overlap integral of three zero - mode profiles , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the corresponding coupling in the higher dimensional theory .",
    "concretely , when wilson lines are vanishing , the overlap integral of @xmath64 for @xmath65 is given  @xcite @xmath66 where the gauge invariance requires the third wavefuction must be @xmath67 with the magnetic flux @xmath65 , but not @xmath68 .",

    "( [ eq : yukawa-2 ] ) and ( [ eq : yukawa - wl ] ) , the number of the kronecker delta is defined modulo @xmath71 and the kronecker delta leads to the selection rule for allowed couplings as @xmath72 where @xmath73 are integers .",
    "when @xmath74 , the above constraint becomes @xmath75 that implies that we can define @xmath76 charge for zero - modes and the allowed couplings are controlled by such a @xmath76 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath76 transformation can be written as  @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 . furthermore",
    ", 4d effective theory has a cyclic permutation symmetry @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath26 is a universal integer , that is , another @xmath76 symmetry .",

    "its diagonal elements are written as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 these symmetries are also available for higher order couplings .",
    "furthermore , when we consider vanishing wilson lines , the @xmath85 twist symmetry is enhanced by the symmetry , @xmath86 and such @xmath85 can be written as @xmath87 then , the permutation symmetry is enhanced from @xmath76 to @xmath88 , and the total symmetry becomes @xmath89 .",
    "for example , when @xmath90 , we can realize @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ".    it would be useful to consider @xmath93 theory from the phenomenological viewpoint .",
    "we consider the fermion field @xmath13 with @xmath93 charges , @xmath94 .",
    "we assume the following form of @xmath95 magnetic flux on @xmath1 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is integer , but there is no magnetic flux in @xmath98 . on top of that , we introduce wilson lines @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath95 and @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "the zero - mode equations are written as @xmath101 then , the number of zero - modes is obtained as @xmath102 and their wavefunctions are written as @xmath103 where @xmath104 . here",
    "we give a few comments .",
    "all of modes with @xmath105 become massive and there do not appear zero - modes with @xmath105 . for @xmath106 , zero - modes with @xmath107 appear and",
    "the number of zero - modes is independent of @xmath108 .",
    "obviously , when we introduce wilson lines @xmath99 and/or @xmath100 without magnetic flux @xmath109 , zero - modes do not appear .",
    "the shift of wavefunctions depends on @xmath110 and the charge @xmath108 .",
    "note that although @xmath111 , wilson lines @xmath112 and charges @xmath108 for @xmath98 are also important . and",
    "charges @xmath108 for @xmath98 are in a sense more important than wilson lines @xmath113 and charges @xmath114 for @xmath95 , because the shift of wavefunctions ( [ eq : wl - shift-2 ] ) depends on @xmath108 . ]    the above aspects of magnetic fluxes and wilson lines are phenomenologically interesting .",
    "we consider 6d super yang - mills theory with non - abelian gauge group @xmath115 .",
    "we introduce a magnetic flux @xmath109 along a cartan direction of @xmath115 .",
    "then , the gauge group breaks to @xmath116 without reducing the rank .",
    "furthermore , there appear the massless fermion fields @xmath117 , which correspond to the gaugino fields for the broken gauge group part and have the fundamental representation of @xmath118 and non - vanishing @xmath95 charge .",
    "furthermore , we introduce wilson line along a cartan direction of @xmath118 . then , the gauge group is broken to @xmath119 without reducing the rank .",
    "the gaugino fields corresponding to the broken gauge part in @xmath118 do not remain as massless modes , but they gain masses due to the wilson line @xmath98 .",
    "however , the fermion fields @xmath117 remain still massless with the same degeneracy .",
    "let us explain more on this aspect .",
    "suppose that we introduce magnetic fluxes in a model with a larger group @xmath115 such that they break @xmath115 to a gut group like @xmath120 and this model include three families of matter fields like @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "their yukawa couplings are computed by the overlap integral of three zero - mode profiles as eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa ] ) .",
    "we obtain the gut relation among yukawa coupling matrices when wavefunction profiles of matter fields in @xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) are degenerate like eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa-2 ] ) .",
    "then , we introduce a wilson line along @xmath123 , which breaks @xmath120 to @xmath124 . because of wilson lines , @xmath120 gauge bosons except the @xmath124 gauge bosons become massive and the corresponding gaugino fields become massive",
    ". however , three families of @xmath121 and @xmath122 matter fields remain massless .",
    "importantly , this wilson line resolves the degeneracy of wavefunction profiles of left - handed quarks , right - handed up - sector quarks and right - handed charged leptons in @xmath121 and right - handed down - sector quarks and left - handed charged leptons in @xmath122 as figure [ fig : wl-10 ] . that is , the gut relation among yukawa coupling matrices is deformed . as an illustrating model , we study the pati - salam model in the next subsection .        here",
    "we study effects due to discrete values of wilson lines such as @xmath125 with @xmath126 integer .",
    "we find @xmath127 thus , the effect of discrete wilson lines @xmath125 is to replace the @xmath43-th zero - mode by the @xmath128-th zero - mode up to @xmath129 .",
    "however , when we consider 3-point and higher order couplings , the gauge invariance requires that the sum of wilson lines of matter fields should vanish , that is , @xmath130 for allowed n - point couplings .",
    "thus , the part @xmath129 is irrelevant to 4d effective theory and the resultant 4d effective theory is the equivalent even when we introduce @xmath125 .",
    "similarly , introducing the wilson lines @xmath131 with @xmath126 integer leads to the equivalent 4d effective theory .      as an illustrating model",
    ", we consider the pati - salam model .",
    "we start with 10d n=1 @xmath132 super yang - mills theory with the lagrangian @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "we compactify the extra 6 dimensions on @xmath135 , and we denote the complex coordinate for the @xmath136-th @xmath137 by @xmath138 , where @xmath139 . then , we introduce the following form of magnetic fluxes , @xmath140 in the gauge space , where @xmath141 are the unit matrices of rank @xmath142 , @xmath143 are integers .",
    "we assume that the above background preserves 4d n=1 supersymmetry ( susy ) . here , we denote @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "this magnetic flux breaks the gauge group @xmath132 to @xmath146 , that is the pati - salam gauge group up to @xmath12 factors .",
    "the gauge sector corresponds to 4d n=4 susy vector multiplet , that is , there are @xmath146 n=1 vector multiplet and three adjoint chiral multiplets . in addition",
    ", there appear bifundamental matter fields like @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , and their numbers of zero - modes are equal to @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "when @xmath153 is negative , that implies their conjugate matter fields appear with the degeneracy @xmath154 .",
    "the fields @xmath147 and @xmath148 correspond to left - handed and right - handed matter fields , respectively , while @xmath149 corresponds to up and down higgs ( higgsino ) fields .",
    "for example , we can realize three families by @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "that leads to @xmath157 or 24 . at any rate , the flavor structure",
    "is determined by the first @xmath158 in such a model .",
    "explicitly , the zero - mode wavefunctions of both @xmath147 and @xmath148 are obtained as @xmath159 their yukawa matrices are constrained by the pati - salam gauge symmetry , that is , up - sector quarks , down - sector quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos have the same yukawa matrices with higgs fields . even with such a constraint , one could derive realistic quark / lepton masses and mixing angles , because this model has many higgs fields and their vacuum expectation values generically break the up - down symmetry .",
    "we introduce wilson lines in @xmath160 and @xmath161 such that @xmath160 breaks to @xmath162 and @xmath161 breaks @xmath163 .",
    "then , the gauge group becomes the standard gauge group up to @xmath12 factors .",
    "furthermore , the profiles of left - handed quarks and leptons in @xmath147 shift differently because of wilson lines .",
    "similarly , right - handed up - sector quarks , down - sector quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos in @xmath148 shift differently .",
    "the flavor structure is determined by the first @xmath158 .",
    "thus , when we introduce wilson lines the second or third torus , the resultant yukawa matrices are constrained by the @xmath164 . for example",
    ", we introduce wilson lines on @xmath165 .",
    "then , zero - mode profiles of quarks , @xmath166 and leptons @xmath167 split as @xmath168 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the wilson lines to break @xmath169 and @xmath170 , respectively . those wilson lines just change the overall factors of yukawa matrices , but ratios among elements in one yukawa matrix do not change .",
    "also we can introduce wilson lines along the same @xmath12 directions as the magnetic fluxes ( [ toronbg ] ) , but they do not deform the up - down symmetry of yukawa matrices , either .",
    "on the other hand , when we introduce wilson lines on the first @xmath158 , the zero - mode wavefunctions split as @xmath171 in this case , the flavor structure is deviated from the @xmath164 relation , that is , mass ratios and mixing angles can change .",
    "also we can introduce wilson lines @xmath99 to @xmath165 and @xmath100 to @xmath158 .",
    "then we realize @xmath172    indeed , this behavior is well - known in the intersecting d - brane models , which are t - duals of magnetized d - brane models . in the intersecting d - brane side ,",
    "introduction of wilson lines corresponds to split d - branes . by splitting d - branes , the gauge group breaks as @xmath173 , but the number of massless bi - fundamental modes does not change , although they decompose because of the gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "here , we study orbifold models with magnetic fluxes and wilson lines . the @xmath174 orbifold is constructed by identifying @xmath175 on @xmath1 .",
    "we also embed the @xmath85 twist into the gauge space as @xmath176 .",
    "note that under the @xmath85 twist , magnetic flux background is invariant .",
    "that is , we have no constraint on magnetic fluxes due to orbifolding .",
    "furthermore , zero - mode wavefunctions satisfy @xmath177 note that @xmath178 .",
    "hence , the @xmath85 eigenstates are written as @xcite @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath181 for @xmath182 are the @xmath85 eigenstates with the @xmath85 even parity .",
    "either of @xmath183 and @xmath184 is projected out by the orbifold projection .",
    "odd wavefunctions can also correspond to massless modes in the magnetic flux background , although on the orbifold without magnetic flux odd modes always correspond to massive modes , but not massless modes . before orbifolding , the number of zero - modes is equal to the magnetic flux @xmath185 .",
    "for example , we have to choose @xmath186 in order to realize the three families . on the other hand",
    ", the number of zero - modes on the orbifold also depends on the boundary conditions under the @xmath85 twist , even or odd functions . for @xmath187 even , the number of zero - modes with even ( odd ) functions are equal to @xmath188 @xmath189 . for @xmath187 odd , the number of zero - modes with even and odd functions are equal to @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "these results are shown in table 1 .",
    "for example , when we choose even ( odd ) functions , the three families can be realized for @xmath192 and 5 ( 7 and 8) .",
    "thus , we can obtain various three - family models in magnetized orbifold models and those have richer flavor structure than torus models with magnetic fluxes .",

    "the @xmath76 symmetry ( [ eq : z ] ) is not commutable for @xmath245 odd .",
    "however , when @xmath245 even , the @xmath85 symmetry , which is generated by @xmath246 is commutable with @xmath243 and another @xmath85 symmetry , which is generated by @xmath247 , is also commutable with @xmath243 .",
    "for example , when @xmath248 , the generators , @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 are written as @xmath252 here , the @xmath250 and @xmath251 generators also commute with each other . similarly , when @xmath253 even , the unbroken flavor symmetry would be obtained as @xmath254 . on the other hand , when @xmath255 , the generators , @xmath249 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 are written as @xmath258 where @xmath259 . here",
    ", the @xmath256 and @xmath257 generators do not commute with each other .",
    "thus , unbroken flavor symmetries are non - abelian .",
    "similarly , when @xmath260 odd , non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries would remain .",
    "when we introduce the above wilson lines , the @xmath195 gauge symmetry is broken at the same time as the @xmath76 symmetry breaking for ( [ eq : z ] ) .",
    "thus , we may expect that some non - trivial linear combinations of broken @xmath76 and @xmath195 would remain .",
    "however , only the @xmath85 symmetry , which is already included above , seems to remain e.g. in the states ( [ eq : z2-state ] ) .",
    "when we consider more complicated models , a new type of flavor symmetries , which are linear combinations of broken flavor symmetries and gauge symmetries , may remain .",
    "hence it would be interesting to investigate such models .",
    "we have studied torus / orbifold models with magnetic fluxes and wilson lines .",
    "these backgrounds lead to various different aspects like the number of zero - modes , their profiles , breaking patterns of flavor symmetries , etc . using these backgrounds",
    ", it would be quite interesting to construct concrete models .",
    "we would study them elsewhere .",
    "in addition to continuous wilson lines , we can introduce discrete wilson lines on the orbifold without magnetic fluxes , which break the gauge group without reducing its rank .",
    "it is quite important to study the possibility for introducing discrete wilson lines in the magnetic background and study their phenomenological implications .",
    "furthermore , it is also important to analyze ( systematically ) which types of backgrounds and boundary conditions are possible in generic case .",
