    "can be unraveled in phononic thermal systems  @xcite , even to pump heat against the temperature bias .",
    "the prototype to describe nanoscale heat transfer mediated by the quantum junction is the nonequilibrium spin - boson model ( nesb )  @xcite , which was originally proposed in the study of quantum dissipation  @xcite .",
    "the nesb is composed of a two - level system ( tls , i.e. , qubit ) interacting with two bosonic thermal baths under temperature bias .",
    "many methods have been proposed to study the microscopic mechanism of quantum heat transfer in the nesb .",
    "particularly , the redfield approach has been extensively applied to analyze the weak qubit - bath coupling regime , mainly due to the effective expression and clear physical picture  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of two thermal baths to the heat flux is additively , which means that only the incoherently resonant heat - exchange processes between the tls and baths are considered .",
    "as such , the limitation of the redfield approach is exposed in the strong quit - bath coupling regime , where the heat flux is nonlinearly dependent on the system - bath coupling strength . in sharp contrast , the nonequilibrium nonteracting - blip approximation ( niba ) is applicable in the strong coupling limit to analytically treat multi - phonon involved processes  @xcite , where the nonadditive and cooperative phonon transfer processes are included .",
    "particularly , the appearance of turnover behavior of heat transfer as a function of system - bath coupling strength in nesb was confirmed by niba , as well as by the multilayer multiconfiguration hartree  @xcite , quantum monte carlo schemes  @xcite and nonequilibrium green function  @xcite .",
    "recently , the nonequilibrium polaron transformed redfield equation ( ne - ptre ) has been proposed to analytically unify steady state heat flux in the weak and strong coupling limits , and the parity classified transfer processes are unravelled  @xcite .    from the dynamical control perspective ,",
    "the time - dependent modulation of heat transfer in nesb has also attracted tremendous attention , enriching the transfer mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the typical realization of the dynamical modulation is the adiabatic quantum pump , which was originally proposed by d. j. thouless to study the effect of quantization induced berry phase on the closed system transport  @xcite . in analogy , as the nesb is adiabatically and periodically driven by control parameters ( e.g. , bath temperatures ) , a geometric - phase induced heat flow will contribute to the heat transfer  @xcite . in the weak system - bath coupling limit ,",
    "it is irrelevant with the coupling strength at resonance  @xcite . whereas the counterpart in the strong coupling limit becomes strictly zero  @xcite .",
    "thus , the question is naturally raised : can we propose an analytical approach to unify the geometric - phase induced heat flux in the weak and strong coupling limits ? in the present paper , by including the full counting statistics , we introduce a generalized ne - ptre to analyze the geometric - phase induced heat flux in the nesb .",

    "( [ jgeoma ] ) , which is excellently agreeable with the numerical result as @xmath208 , shown in the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](b ) . if the system - bath couplings are identically selected as @xmath209 , the relation between the coupling strength and the energy bias is expressed as @xmath210 , which is consistent with the numerical result in fig .  2 at ref .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the geometric - phase induced heat pump in the nonequilibrium spin - boson model by periodically modulating temperatures of two thermal baths , which is beyond the traditional redfield and nonequilibrium niba schemes . by developing nonequilibrium polaron - transformed redfield equation ( ne - ptre ) approach in the context of full counting statistics ,",
    "the cumulant generating function is clearly demonstrated , which is contributed by both the dynamical and geometric phases . in absence of the external driving field , the influence of qubit energy bias on the steady state heat flux and the corresponding noise power were analytically analyzed .",
    "when in the weak and moderate coupling regimes , the energy bias was found to monotonically enhance both the steady state heat flux and the noise power . while in the strong coupling regime , these two observables become independent on the energy bias .",
    "this clearly demonstrates the same role of the energy bias in affecting the heat flux and the noise power .",
    "then , we analyzed geometric heat pump at resonance by varying qubit - bath coupling strength in a wide regime . in the weak system - bath coupling limit ,",
    "geometric heat flux is positive finite , which is equivalent to the counterpart within redfield scheme .",
    "as the coupling strength increases , geometric heat flux shows monotonic decrease , and finally approaches strictly zero , which is identical with the result based on nonequilibrium niba .",
    "we also studied the geometric heat pump at the off - resonant condition .",
    "it was found that geometric heat pump decreases quickly as the qubit - bath coupling increases , and shows reversal behavior in the strong coupling regime .",
    "moreover , the analytical relations of the heat flux with the system - bath coupling and the energy bias are obtained .",
    "the results based on the ne - ptre also show consistency with the counterparts from the redfield and nonequilibrium niba schemes , in the weak and strong coupling regimes , respectively .",
    "hence , we conclude that this unified theory is applicable to obtain the geometric heat flux in the nonequilibrium spin - boson model , both at resonance and off - reosonance .",
    "moreover , we turned to analyze the influence of the qubit energy bias on the geometric heat pump .",
    "geometric heat flux is negatively enhanced in the strong qubit - bath coupling regime , which is in sharp contrast to the counterpart in the weak coupling case , exhibiting positive increase .",
    "we hope that these results should have broad implications for smart control of energy transfer in low - dimensional nanodevices .",
