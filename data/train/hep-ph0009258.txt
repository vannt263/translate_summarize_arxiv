    "<S> we study @xmath0 and @xmath1 production and the influence of nuclear shadowing at lhc and rhic energies . we find a significant reduction in the production cross section of both charm and bottom at rhic and lhc . </S>",
    "<S> bound states such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 are suppressed by this reduction in the charm production cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath3 suppression may not be useful as a signature for the quark gluon plasma .    </S>",
    "<S> as lattice qcd results indicated , hadronic matter probably undergoes a phase transition into a deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , provided a temperature about 200 mev or an energy density @xmath4 2 gev/@xmath5 is reached @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high energy heavy - ion colliders at rhic ( au - au at @xmath6=200 gev ) and lhc ( pb - pb at @xmath6=5.5 tev ) will provide the best opportunity to study the formation and evolution of quark - gluon plasma @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as qgp exists only for a very short time ( several fermi ) in a small volume ( @xmath4 100 @xmath5 ) , a direct detection of this state of matter is not possible . </S>",
    "<S> thus various indirect signatures have to be used for its detection . </S>",
    "<S> the prominent ones among the suggested signatures are @xmath3 suppression @xcite , strangeness enhancement @xcite , dilepton and photon production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although these signatures are proposed , it is not easy to make a concrete calculation of them for these experiments . </S>",
    "<S> many uncertainties , both theoretical and experimental , exist which make it very difficult to claim the existence of the quark - gluon plasma based on the measurement of these signatures . at the present experiment at sps most of the signatures </S>",
    "<S> can be explained by alternative methods without assuming the existence of quark - gluon plasma . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will study the impact of such non - qgp sources on the production of @xmath7 at rhic and lhc energies .    </S>",
    "<S> we mention here that due to the presence of nuclear , quark - gluon and hadronic medium a correct computation of @xmath3 suppression in ultra relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhic ) becomes extremely difficult . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight here the major uncertainties associated with the calculation of @xmath7 suppression . </S>",
    "<S> first of all one has to understand the production of @xmath7 in nuclear collisions before addressing its suppressions . </S>",
    "<S> the main uncertainty lies in the accurate determination of the non - perturbative matrix element for @xmath7 production from the @xmath8 pair . before a decade ago one used to use the colour singlet model for @xmath7 production at high energy hadronic collisions where it is assumed that the @xmath8 is produced directly as a colour singlet state which forms the @xmath7 bound state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the colour singlet model failed to describe the high momenta @xmath7 production data at the cdf experiment @xcite . an effective qcd formalism based on non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics </S>",
    "<S> was developed where one assumes that the @xmath9 is formed as a colour octet state which finally emits a soft gluon to form a colour singlet @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model ( known as colour octet model ) is very successful in explaining the @xmath7 production data at the cdf experiment at fermi lab @xcite . in this model </S>",
    "<S> the non - perturbative matrix element for @xmath7 formation from @xmath9 is determined from the experiment . however , it is not at all clear how to obtain this non - perturbative matrix element for high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the complication arises due to the presence of a nuclear / quark - gluon medium . </S>",
    "<S> the second uncertainty lies in the accurate determination of the nuclear partonic structure function used to compute @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> once these two issues are solved then one can compute @xmath7 production in high energy heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we will address here how significantly the heavy quark production cross section is changed when modified nuclear partonic structure functions are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this will have a direct impact on the quarkonium production cross section in high energy heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc .    before proceeding to our calculation </S>",
    "<S> we briefly mention some of the other effects which must be considered for a correct calculation of @xmath7 suppression . </S>",
    "<S> first of all we mention that the space - time evolution of quark - gluon plasma in ultra relativistic heavy - ion collisions is described in various stages , namely ; 1 ) pre - equilibrium , 2 ) equilibrium and 3 ) hadronization . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath8 is formed , it travels in pre - equilibrium stage of the quark - gluon plasma </S>",
    "<S> . the charm quarks scatter with the light quarks and gluons in the medium and hence change the energy , momentum and separation of the @xmath9 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> it is not easy to keep track of all the interactions a charm quark encounters during its propagation in the non - equilibrium medium . </S>",
    "<S> this is because a correct description of non - equilibrium space - time evolution of the quarks and gluons formed in nuclear collisions is not solved accurately . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if a @xmath7 is formed , then its interaction with quarks and gluons in non - equilibrium medium has also to be taken into account . in the equilibrium stage </S>",
    "<S> one can argue that they are screened . </S>",
    "<S> but a real dynamical screening argument has to be given . </S>",
    "<S> the screening argument given in @xcite is valid for a static plasma as calculations were done in lattice qcd which assumes a static temperature . in heavy - ion collisions the temperature is local and space - time dependent and </S>",
    "<S> a screening calculation involving local space - time dependent temperature is not available . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 also interacts with the hadrons in the hadronic phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence all these effects have to be considered in the study of @xmath7 suppression at rhic and lhc .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address one of the above issues , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ we compute heavy - quark production at rhic and lhc by taking modifications of the nuclear partonic distribution functions into account . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of nuclear parton distribution functions ( _ i.e , _ @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) has been observed in various experiments @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the quark and gluon structure functions of the nucleus ( nucleon ) , @xmath14 is the momentum fraction of the parton , and @xmath15 is the momentum transfer in deep inelastic lepton nucleus ( nucleon ) scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we take the modified parton distribution functions from a previous study @xcite , where it has been shown that there is a strong shadowing of the parton distribution functions at low @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of parton fusion was first formulated in @xcite and later proven in @xcite to appear when the total transverse size 1/q of the partons in a nucleon becomes larger than the proton radius to yield a transverse overlapping within a unit of rapidity @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the fusion correction in the free nucleon turns out to be significant only for unusually small values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the case of heavy nuclei of a @xmath4 200 , the parton recombination is strongly increased ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this strong shadowing is expected to reduce the heavy quark production significantly . </S>",
    "<S> we incorporate this feature of gluon shadowing in the calculation of @xmath9 production at rhic and lhc heavy - ion collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> we use perturbative qcd methods to compute charm and bottom production at rhic and lhc nuclear collisions . </S>",
    "<S> as we are interested in comparing the results of heavy - quark production using unshadowed and shadowed parton distributions we will not do a next - to - leading order calculation for @xmath17 production . for our purpose </S>",
    "<S> we consider the leading order gluon fusion process @xmath18 for heavy quark - antiquark pair production . for simplicity a k factor </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 2 can be multiplied with this leading order cross section to consider higher order processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon fusion process is dominant at high energy hadron - hadron collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the squared amplitude for the above leading order process is given by @xcite :    @xmath19,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where m is the mass of the heavy quark @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the mandelstam variables @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are defined by @xmath24 with the four - momenta @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 of the incident and the scattered particles respectively . using the amplitude for the @xmath29 process </S>",
    "<S> , the partonic cross section can be written as @xmath30 assuming @xmath31 @xcite , the @xmath32 can be taken out of the @xmath22 integration to find @xmath33\\ ] ] with @xmath34 this cross section in the partonic level can be used to compute the @xmath17 production cross section in hadronic collisions by using the parton distribution functions inside the hadron . the total cross section for @xmath35 production per nucleon in aa collision </S>",
    "<S> is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the gluon structure function of a bound nucleon inside the nucleus @xmath39 . on these equations nuclear shadowing effects in @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> will have an influence , as the nuclear structure functions are reduced in comparison to free nucleon structure functions at low @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the shadowing version of parton distribution functions in a bound nucleon from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( with a = 208 ) together with the grv98 set of gluon distribution functions for a free nucleon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling constant @xmath40 used in the above equation is also taken from @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we mention here that our calculation is based on primary hard collisions of partons . </S>",
    "<S> these primary hard collisions also produce a huge number of jets and minijets at rhic and lhc energies . unlike in pp collisions these minijets </S>",
    "<S> suffer from secondary collisions because they are large in number . </S>",
    "<S> secondary collisions among these primarily produced minijets bring the system towards equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary collisions among these minijets can also produce additional @xmath9 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be checked whether this heavy quark production is small or large due to their large masses . </S>",
    "<S> it can be argued that the secondary charm production is very small for an equilibrium quark - gluon plasma because the production rate behaves like @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the early pre - equilibrium stage of the quark - gluon plasma , the average energy carried by a parton is large and hence their secondary collisions can produce significant secondary @xmath8 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> one needs a real calculation by using non - equilibrium distribution of the minijet plasma at rhic and lhc to see whether the secondary @xmath8 pair production becomes larger / smaller than the primary charm production . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary charm production calculation is very important because a huge production of secondary charm may suggest an enhancement of @xmath7 at rhic and lhc rather than its suppression . in any case , the shadowing will also decrease the minijet production @xcite . in such situations the minijet temperature will also be reduced which in turn will decrease secondary charm production . </S>",
    "<S> hence as far as shadowing of initial parton distributions is concerned , it decreases both primary and secondary charm productions . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we will present results of the cross section for heavy quark - antiquark pair production from primary partonic collisions at different center of mass energies to observe the effect of shadowing on quarkonium production .    in fig.1 we present the cross section ( in mb ) for heavy quark / anti - quark pair production at rhic energy as a function of the heavy - quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line is obtained by using no - shadowing gluon distribution functions , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e , _ we have used @xmath42 , with @xmath43 taken from the grv98 parametrization @xcite ( note that @xmath38 used in eq . ( [ g ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is the distribution function of a bound nucleon inside a nucleus a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be mentioned that our results are with respect to the nucleon - nucleon scattering in nuclear collisions . to estimate the total cross section in nucleus - nucleus collisions </S>",
    "<S> , one has to multiply our results by @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is obtained by using strong shadowing of gluons at high energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the shadowing in gluon distribution function decreases the heavy quark production cross section significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of charm quark production cross section at rhic and lhc is interesting because the suppression of @xmath7 may be due to the shadowing of the initial gluon distribution functions inside the nucleus rather than existence of qgp . </S>",
    "<S> however , before making any conclusions , one has to compute @xmath7 production by using a suitable model for hadronization . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , one has to compute secondary charm quarks which are produced from the rescattering of minijets being formed in high energy heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted the ratio of heavy - quark production cross sections with and without shadowing in the same figure . </S>",
    "<S> this is represented by the dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> our results cover both charm and bottom quark production at rhic . in future rhic will provide an opportunity to measure open charm production .    in fig.2 we present the cross section for heavy quark / anti - quark pair production at lhc energy as a function of the heavy - quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> we present our results up to @xmath45 200 gev which covers charm , bottom and top quark production at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> dotted , dashed and solid lines correspond to the same situation as in fig.1 . the difference in charm and bottom quark production at lhc </S>",
    "<S> is found to be much larger than that at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen from the figure that the shadowing effect on charm production is much larger than that on bottom production . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio is close to 1 for the production of the top quark .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.3 we present the @xmath8 production cross section as a function of @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted line is for the case without shadowing , and the solid line is with shadowing of gluons . it can be seen that the @xmath8 production cross section at rhic for both cases is not much different . however , the difference becomes quite large when the calculation is repeated for very high energy nuclear collisions . at lhc energy </S>",
    "<S> the reduction in the cross section is quite large , about a factor of 10 . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for @xmath47 production at different energies , see fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> we mention here that our results are obtained from the leading order partonic scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> our results can be multiplied by a k factor ( @xmath4 2 ) to take higher order processes into account .    to summarize , </S>",
    "<S> we have computed heavy quark / anti - quark pair production cross sections per nucleon - nucleon collision in rhic and lhc heavy - ion collisions with shadowing of parton structure functions taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the shadowing of parton distribution functions significantly decreases the production cross section of heavy quarks at lhc . </S>",
    "<S> at rhic energy this difference is not very large but still significant . </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain the total charm production at rhic and lhc from these cross sections via the relation @xmath48 , where the glauber geometrical factor @xmath49 for the impact parameter b=0 fm . </S>",
    "<S> this geometrical factor represents the total number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in central aa collisions , which behaves like @xmath50 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the difference of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections for shadowing and no shadowing at rhic is not large , there is a significant difference in the total number of charm and bottom quarks for the two versions of shadowing . </S>",
    "<S> this has a direct impact on quarkonium and open charm production at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that a reduction of the charm quark cross section due to shadowing is very significant because @xmath7 suppression might occur due to the depletion of the initial gluon distribution functions rather than due to the existence of a quark - gluon plasma or due to the presence of hadronic medium .    </S>",
