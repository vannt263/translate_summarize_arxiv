    "interfacial free energies between a crystal or liquid in contact with a solid wall are a key determinant of several interfacial phenomena such as wetting  @xcite , adhesion and heterogeneous nucleation  @xcite . however , they are difficult to determine in experiments and very few results are available in the literature  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . therefore , molecular simulation techniques such as molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite play an important role to elucidate interfacial phenomena . since",
    "molecular simulations can be used to determine the same thermodynamic quantity via various computational strategies , reliable estimates of the desired quantities are obtained by comparing the results obtained from the different methods . in this work , our objective is to employ several different computational techniques for obtaining reliable estimates of the wall - liquid and wall - crystal interfacial free energies , in the following denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .    in order to calculate @xmath0 , mechanical techniques can be employed to compute the interfacial tension from the pressure anisotropy ( pa )  @xcite .",
    "several authors have used this technique to calculate @xmath2 for both hard - sphere @xcite and lennard - jones ( lj ) systems @xcite . since",
    ", in general , the interfacial tension is not equal to the interfacial free energy  @xcite , except in case of a liquid in contact with a static wall , the mechanical approach fails in situations involving liquid in contact with a wall consisting of a `` fully interacting solid phase ''  @xcite or for a crystal in contact with a solid wall  @xcite .",
    "another drawback is the massive computational effort needed to obtain reliable results , since the interfacial tension being the difference of the normal and tangential pressure profiles is very sensitive to small numerical errors  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the pa method , thermodynamic integration ( ti ) techniques  @xcite are applicable to a wider class of systems including systems where the liquid interacts with an elastic wall or for wall - crystal interfaces .",
    "various ti schemes have been proposed for the calculation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and applied to systems modelled by hard - sphere , lj or other soft interaction potentials  @xcite .",
    "while the ti method is simple to understand and easy to implement in md or mc simulations , care has to be taken that the switching protocol that transforms the initial to the final state is reversible and does not lead to any hysteresis . as a result ,",
    "the computational load can be considerable .",
    "a less computationally expensive method , which does not require the constraint of a reversible switching protocol , is the non - equilibrium work method . in 1997 , jarzynski showed that one can extract the equilibrium free energy difference between two states from an exponential average of the non - equilibrium work performed on the system during a transformation from one state to another  @xcite .",
    "however , to obtain an accurate estimate of the free energy difference using the jarzynski equality ( je ) , the tail of the work probability distribution must be well sampled , which is possible only if an extremely large number of independent runs are performed  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in general , a direct application of the jarzynski equality leads to a significant bias and variance in the free energy estimates  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that one can overcome this disadvantage by carrying out both forward and backward transformations between the two states and then estimating the equilibrium free energy difference using the bennett acceptance ratio ( bar )  @xcite .",
    "the bar method has been applied to obtain the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy for both hard sphere and lj systems  @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge there have been no studies where non - equilibrium work approaches have been used to compute @xmath4 or @xmath1 .",
    "if interfacial free energies are needed at many points along a coexistence curve , say , the ti and bar methods would both be computationally expensive .",
    "recently , laird and others have obtained @xmath0 for a hard - sphere system by integrating along a pressure curve  @xcite and the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy for lj systems as a function of temperature along the coexistence curve  @xcite using the  gibbs - cahn integration \" method .",
    "this technique is based on adsorption equations derived by cahn  @xcite to extend gibbs s interfacial thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the  gibbs - cahn integration \" ( gc ) method requires that the values for the interfacial free energy is already known at one point along the curve , then at the remaining points the free energies can be determined by integrating along the curve . while , laird and davidchack computed @xmath0 for hard spheres in contact with a hard wall , there have been no corresponding studies for lj systems .",
    "although , the above described methods can be employed to determine @xmath0 and @xmath1 , _ a priori _ it is not known which technique yields the most accurate results . to investigate this issue",
    ", we use different computational methods to arrive at reliable estimates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 and also discuss the computational efficiency of each method . to this end",
    ", we compute @xmath1 and @xmath0 for a lj system in contact with solid walls from non - equilibrium work measurements using the je and bar methods and compare the results with a ti scheme devised in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the interfacial free energies are computed for both a bulk lj liquid and a bulk lj face centred cubic crystal oriented along the ( 111 ) direction .",
    "we consider two kinds of solid walls : one is a flat structureless wall and the other one is a structured wall consisting of particles rigidly attached to fcc lattice sites with the ( 111 ) orientation of the wall in contact with the system . in this work ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are obtained by our ti scheme and non - equilibrium work methods ; the wall - liquid interfacial free energy , @xmath0 is also determined via the gc method as well as the pa technique .",
    "results from the four different approaches are compared with each other .",
    "if in addition to the wall - liquid and wall - crystal interfacial free energies , one has knowledge about the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy , @xmath5 , a direct determination of the degree of wetting of a solid surface by a substance can be obtained from young s equation  @xcite , @xmath6 with @xmath7 the contact angle .",

    "the structured wall was constructed from an ideal fcc crystal with the ( 111 ) orientation along the @xmath31 direction and with an integer number of unit cells that fit exactly into the simulation cell .",
    "the reason for choosing @xmath32 different from @xmath33 was to obtain a large parameter range with respect to the energy scale @xmath34 and the lattice constant of the wall @xmath35 [ where @xmath36 , @xmath37 being the density of the structured wall ] , providing the possibility of incomplete wetting conditions . in the case of @xmath38 , complete wetting would be more likely than partial wetting , even for moderate interaction strengths between the wall and the lj system .",
    "the @xmath11 identical lj particles are enclosed within a simulation cell of size @xmath39 , with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath40 and @xmath41 directions .",
    "our simulations are carried out in the @xmath42 ensemble with the total density @xmath43 kept constant . along the @xmath31 direction",
    "the particles are confined by the walls such that there are two planar wall - liquid ( or wall - crystal ) interfaces with a total area of @xmath44 and with the gibbs dividing surface located at the surface of the wall .",
    "the width of the structured wall is chosen large enough to avoid lj particles on opposite sides of the wall from interacting with each other since the determination of interfacial free energy is built on the assumption of two independent wall - liquid ( or wall - crystal ) interfaces .    in our earlier work",
    "@xcite on computing @xmath45 and @xmath3 for structured walls via ti , we adopted a scheme which consists of two steps .",
    "first , a bulk lj system with periodic boundary conditions is transformed into a state where the lj system is in contact with flat walls on either side in the @xmath31 direction .",
    "then , in the second step , the flat walls are reversibly transformed into structured walls .",
    "the structureless flat wall ( fw ) was also taken to be a purely repulsive potential interacting along the @xmath31 direction with the lj particles and is described by a wca potential , @xmath46 \\times w(z ) \\label{eq : ufwallwca}\\ ] ] for @xmath47 and zero otherwise .",
    "note that for @xmath48 the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are identical to those chosen for @xmath33 .",
    "the variable @xmath49 denotes the distance between a particle @xmath13 at @xmath50 to one of the flat walls at @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "the function @xmath53 ensures that @xmath48 goes smoothly to zero at @xmath54 and is given by @xmath55 with the dimensionless parameter @xmath56 .",
    "below , results for @xmath2 and @xmath3 for both the flat and structured wall cases are presented .",
    "when a system is transformed from one equilibrium state to another , the total work @xmath57 performed on the system is larger than the free energy difference , @xmath58 , between the states , @xmath59 this inequality holds because some of the work is always dissipated as heat , i.e. @xmath60 with @xmath61 the dissipated work .",
    "the equality @xmath62 holds when the process is reversible such that the dissipated work goes to zero .",
    "this reversible work is essentially what one computes in the ti method where one changes the switching parameter infinitely slowly such that the transformation is reversible . as a result , the ti method yields the free energy difference between a desired state and some reference state  @xcite .",
    "usually a parameter which couples to the interaction potential is gradually changed such that the reference state is reversibly transformed into the final state of interest .    to calculate the interfacial free energy of the lj system in contact with a structured wall ,",
    "the ti scheme is carried out in two steps . in the first step ,",
    "a bulk lj system without walls and periodic boundary conditions in all directions is reversibly transformed into a lj system in contact with a structureless flat wall along the @xmath31 direction . in the second step",
    ", the flat wall interacting with the lj system is reversibly transformed into a structured wall . calculating the total free energy difference @xmath58 combined from the two steps yields the required interfacial free energy , defined as @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 representing the helmholtz free energies of the inhomogeneous system and the bulk phase of the system , respectively .",
    "for details we refer the reader to our earlier work  @xcite . in both steps of our ti scheme the transformation from one equilibrium state to another is carried out by gradually changing a switching parameter @xmath66 , which couples directly to the interaction potential .",
    "although the ti method yields reliable values for interfacial free energies , it is computationally expensive so as to ensure reversibility . in principle",
    ", the switching protocol needs to be infinitely slow when computing the free energy difference from a sequential change of the switching parameter or by carrying out simultaneous simulations at many independent values of the switching parameter between the initial and final states , so as to prevent any hysteresis or numerical integration errors resulting from a non - smooth thermodynamic integrand . besides , in many cases a reversible ti path might be difficult to construct .",
    "a less computationally expensive method , which is independent of the reversibility of the switching protocol is the non - equilibrium work method .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : seclaw ] ) shows that the free energy difference between two equilibrium states can only be obtained from a reversible transformation between them .",
    "however , in 1997 jarzynski  @xcite proposed an equality , now known as the jarzynski equality , that allows to extract free energy differences between two states even if the transformation from the initial to the final state proceeds via a non - equilibrium process .",
    "the jarzynski equality ( je ) can be written as @xmath68 with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 : boltzmann constant , @xmath71 : temperature ) and the work @xmath72 here , the hamiltonian @xmath73 [ see eq .",
    "( 7 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite and accompanying text for details regarding the hamiltonian ] depends on the parameter @xmath66 that provides the switching from state to state ; @xmath74 is the rate at which the parameter @xmath66 is changed to transform one state to another .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) starts from an equilibrium state at time @xmath75 to a final state at the switching time @xmath76 . in a simulation",
    ", the free energy difference between the initial and the finite state is estimated by @xmath77 with @xmath78 the number of independent runs and @xmath79 the value of the work , obtained from the @xmath13th run . the estimate @xmath80 approaches the exact free energy difference @xmath58 for @xmath81 .    for slow transformations ( @xmath82 ) ,",
    "the system is in quasi static equilibrium at each instant throughout the transformation and the switching process reduces to a conventional ti .",
    "however , for finite switching times @xmath83 , the system is in a non - equilibrium state and while the je holds irrespective of the duration @xmath83 over which the switching parameter is varied , its practical utility is limited since the exponential work average depends on how well the tail of the work probability distribution with work values that are less than the equilibrium free energy difference are sampled  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the je is a practical tool to obtain free energy differences only for slow switching processes where the system remains close to equilibrium at each instant during the transformation .",
    "in such a situation , the average work converges to @xmath58 within a reasonable number of independent runs .",
    "however , for fast switching times , the exponentially averaged work exhibits a huge bias in comparison to the equilibrium free energy difference and is also accompanied by a large standard deviation  @xcite .",
    "shirts _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that a good convergence toward @xmath58 can be obtained by carrying out simulations with both forward as well as reverse switching runs .",
    "in the reverse runs , the final state is transformed into the initial state by following a mirror image of the forward switching protocol . using the bennett acceptance ratio ( bar ) method  @xcite",
    ", the free energy difference is finally obtained from the following transcendental equation , @xmath84 }   - \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{r } } \\frac{1 } { 1+\\exp [ -\\frac{w - \\delta f}{k_bt } ] } = 0 \\label{eq : bar}\\ ] ] that can be solved via the newton - raphson method  @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bar ] ) , @xmath85 and @xmath86 represent respectively the forward and reverse switching processes and @xmath87 and @xmath88 refer respectively to the number of forward and reverse switching trajectories . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case @xmath89 .",
    "it has been shown that the bar method leads to the minimum bias and variance when computing the free energy difference via non - equilibrium work methods  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the bar method crucially depends on the switching time @xmath83 used to transform the initial state to the final state .",
    "a large switching time will make the method inefficient , while an extremely short @xmath83 will lead to a bias in the free energy estimate . the optimal switching time is not known beforehand .",
    "hence , we will use both the je and bar methods with the same parametrization as in the ti scheme and with three different switching times ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 in reduced units ) to compute the interfacial free energies and compare our results to the ti method .",
    "corresponding to the first step in the ti , the forward switching process transforms the bulk lj system into that in contact with impenetrable flat walls in the @xmath31 direction . for this step",
    "the reverse process consists of gradually switching off of the flat walls in contact with the system to revert back to the bulk liquid or crystal with periodic boundary condition in all directions .",
    "similarly , corresponding to the second ti step , the forward switching process consists of a lj system in contact with a flat wall being transformed to one in contact with the structured wall . in the reverse process",
    ", the structured walls are gradually switched off and the flat walls switched on , such that a liquid or crystal in contact only with a flat wall is obtained as the final state .      while the non - equilibrium work method might be computationally advantageous compared to the ti scheme , it is still inefficient if one needs to compute the interfacial free energies at many points along a coexistence curve .",
    "carrying out simulations at each point would be cumbersome and require a huge computational effort .",
    "in such cases it is computationally advantageous to use the `` gibbs - cahn integration '' method , where a differential equation is solved to obtain interfacial free energies along a coexistence curve if the value at one point on the curve is known beforehand from the ti or bar method .",
    "the gibbs - cahn integration method has been used to obtain the interfacial free energy of a hard - sphere fluid in contact with a flat wall  @xcite , the crystal - liquid interfacial free energy for lj systems  @xcite , and the crystal - vapor and crystal - liquid interfacial free energies for metallic systems  @xcite . in this work ,",

    "the gibbs - cahn integration method is most useful when interfacial free energies are needed along a parameter space where an intensive thermodynamic variable such as pressure or temperature is varied .",
    "since for structured wall interfaces we compute the interfacial free energies as a function of the wall density and interaction strength between the bulk phase and wall , the gc method is not suitable for such cases .",
