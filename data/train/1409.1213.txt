    "jets are a common feature of high energy astrophysical sources powered by accretion onto compact objects .",
    "grb jets are thought to be the most extreme in terms of typical power ( 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath1 ) and of lorentz factor ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "long grbs are thought to follow the gravitational collapse of massive stars which form a rotating black hole with a bipolar jet along its rotational axis .",
    "the large isotropic equivalent energy @xmath9 of the prompt emission can exceed a solar mass rest energy , unless the radiation is collimated ( tan , matzner & mckee 2001 ) . the observed steepening of the afterglow flux light curve a few days after the burst is interpreted as the direct evidence of the presence of collimation .",
    "it has been typically assumed that grbs have a _ uniform jet _ ( uj ) : the energy and ejecta velocity are constant , within the jet aperture , and zero outside the jet opening angle ( i.e. sharp  edged jet ) . during the afterglow phase , when the emission is produced by the deceleration of the relativistic jet by the interstellar medium , a steepening of the observed afterglow flux",
    "is predicted when @xmath10 ( rhoads 1997 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "the measure of the time of this break ( @xmath11 ) has been used to infer the jet opening angle @xmath12 which results distributed in the 1@xmath1310@xmath13 range .",
    "intriguingly , the true energetic of grbs ( i.e. accounting for their collimation ) clusters around a typical value @xmath14@xmath15 erg with a dispersion of less than a decade ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) , correlating with the peak energy of the prompt emission spectrum @xmath16 ( ghirlanda et al . 2004 ; nava et al .",
    "such typical value for the true energy of grbs is also directly probed by late time radio observations ( frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 ; frail et al .",
    "2005 ; shivvers & berger 2011 ) . for small jet angles ,",
    "the collimation corrected @xmath17 .",
    "the small dispersion of  led to the idea that the jet is not uniform , but _ structured _",
    ", where @xmath18 is the angular distance from the jet axis , and coincides with the viewing angle @xmath19 .",
    "this scenario assumes that what we believed to be the jet angle @xmath12 is actually the viewing angle @xmath19 .",
    "this can lead to a unification scheme in which all bursts are basically equal , but appear different only because they are seen under different angles .",
    "if the dependence of the burst energetics on @xmath18 is @xmath20 , one recovers the finding of frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of the clustering of .",
    "these grbs with a universal structured jet ( sj ) were first proposed by lipunov , postnov & prokhorov ( 2001 ) and then studied by rossi , lazzati & rees ( 2002 ) and zhang & meszaros ( 2002 ) .",
    "some structure to the jet power and velocity could be imprinted , within the collapsar model , by the interaction of the jet with the star ( e.g. zhang , woosley & mac fadyen 2003 ; zhang , woosley & heger 2004 ; lazzati & begelman 2005 ; morsony , lazzati & begelman 2010 ; levinson & eichler 2003 ; lyutikov & blandford 2002 ) or instead the sj could have an  external \" origin ( ghisellini et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "direct tests of the sj model with available data , e.g. the search for a possible anti correlation between  and  ( perna , sari & frail 2003 ; lloyd  ronning , dai & zhang 2004 ) or the statistical studies of the flux cumulative distribution of large grb samples in the sj model , did not provide definite evidence for this model ( nakar , granot & guetta 2004 ; cui , liang & lu 2005 ) .",
    "however , the presence of a structured jet is invoked to interpret some grbs with a double jet break in their afterglow light curves ( e.g. grb 991216  frail et al .",
    "2000 ; grb 030329  berger et al .",
    "2003 , sheth et al . 2003",
    "; grb 021004 - starling et al .",
    "2005 ) . in these cases ,",
    "a  discrete \" sj model composed by a narrow jet surrounded by a wider cone was proposed ( peng , koenigl & granot 2005 ) , possibly due to the interaction of the jet with the star cocoon ( ramirez  ruiz , celotti & rees 2002 ; vlahkis , peng & koenigl 2003 ; lazzati & begelman 2005 ) .",
    "several grb properties are affected by the jet structure : the achromatic break   in the afterglow light curve is smoother in the sj model and it is related to @xmath19 rather than @xmath12 ( zhang & meszaros 2002 ) ; different degree of polarization of the afterglow emission ( rossi et al . 2004 ; lazzati et al . 2004 ) and different luminosity functions ( and grb rates ) are expected in the two scenarios .",
    "the jet break measurements are hampered by the necessity of a follow up of the afterglow emission until late times , by the smoothing induced by viewing angle effects ( e.g. van eerten & macfadyen 2012 ) and by the contamination of the afterglow emission at late times by the possible supernova and host galaxy emission ( e.g. ghirlanda et al . 2007 ) . despite all these diagnostics , there is no concluding evidence yet of the real jet structure . on the other hand , the increasing number of bursts with measured redshift allows to estimate the luminosity function of grbs with increasing confidence .",
    "we show in this paper how the jet structure affects the observed luminosity function .",
    "the most recent studies of the grb luminosity function are by wanderman & piran 2010 with a relatively large grb sample , and by salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2012 ) with a relatively small but complete grb sample .",
    "grbs with measured redshift have typical isotropic equivalent luminosities in the range @xmath21 erg s@xmath1 . at lower luminosities",
    "the detection rate drops to only a few events which are , however , representative of a large local density of grbs ( e.g. soderberg et al . 2006 ; pian et al .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that these latter events could belong to a different grb population ( e.g. virgili et al .",
    "2009 ; daigne & mochkovitch 2007 ) .      in this paper",
    "we first consider the low luminosity grbs to discuss if they can be accounted for by the extrapolation of the luminosity function ( lf ) describing high luminosity grbs (  2 ) . in this case",
    "we would have a luminosity function ( lf ) extending over 7 orders of magnitude to be compared with different models .",
    "then we study four different possibilities :    1 .",
    "first we consider the simplest model : all jets are uniform , with the same @xmath12 and are seen always on  axis , but we assume that the jet had to punch the progenitor star before emerging , and in so doing it must spend @xmath22 erg . we derive the predicted lf in this case , and compare it to the data (  3.1.1 ) .",
    "then we allow @xmath12 to vary as a function of the observed luminosity , but we still assume that all bursts are seen on  axis .",
    "bursts of equal collimation corrected luminosity , but of different @xmath12 will have different isotropically equivalent luminosities @xmath23 ( the smaller @xmath12 , the larger @xmath23 ) .",
    "also in this case we can construct analytically the lf , and we compare it with the data (  3.1.2 ) 3 .",
    "we consider the possibility that ( some ) grbs can be detected even if observed off ",
    "axis , even if the jet is uniform .",
    "in fact any grb will emit not only within @xmath12 , but also outside , even if the corresponding radiation is not as relativistically boosted as the radiation inside the jet cone .",
    "the observable off  axis luminosity depends on the bulk lorentz factor ( the larger @xmath24 , the dimmest the off  axis luminosity ) .",
    "the predicted lf for a single value of @xmath24 and @xmath12 can be derived analytically , allowing for an easy numerical computation of the lf with a distribution of @xmath24 and @xmath12 .",
    "the latter is compared to the data (  3.2 ) .",
    "4 .   finally , we consider structured jets , characterized by a power law dependence of the radiated energy with the angle from the jet axis ( @xmath25 ) to find out if the data are consistent with this scenario , and for which slope @xmath26 (  4 ) .    we discuss our results in  5 . in the paper",
    "we assume a standard flat cosmology with @xmath27 .",
    "the problem of deriving the luminosity function [ lf  @xmath28 of grbs has been approached by different authors ( firmani et al . 2004 ; guetta et al . 2005 ; natarajan et al .",
    "2005 , daigne et al .",
    "2006 , salvaterra & chincarini 2007 ; salvaterra et al . 2009 ; 2012 ) by convolving @xmath29 with the grb formation rate @xmath30 ( proportional to the cosmic star formation rate ) .",
    "the free parameters of the lf can be constrained by fitting the resulting model to the flux distribution of large grb samples ( e.g. the /batse population ) .",
    "note that , in the grb literature , it is customary to consider as cosmic evolution any ( i.e. density , or luminosity , or both ) evolution _ in addition _ to the one related to the evolution of the star formation rate .",
    "the main difficulty of these studies is accounting , in the model , for the selection effects which affect the true grb population detected by any instrument .",
    "recently , salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2012  s12 hereafter ) constructed a flux limited sample of bright grbs detected by /bat which resulted 95% complete in redshift . while the possible evolution of the luminosity function or of the grb formation rate with redshift is still a matter of debate , there seems to be a general consensus on the shape of the lf : @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the break luminosity .",
    "s12 finds @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 erg s@xmath1 ( 68% confidence intervals ) for the case of no evolution of @xmath29 .",

    "they selected a sample of long grbs with spectroscopically measured redshift and isotropic equivalent luminosities @xmath38 erg s@xmath1 detected by bat on board",
    ". the derived lf is represented by a discrete series of data points ( fig .",
    "3 of wp10 ) in eight equal logarithmic bins of luminosity and can be represented by a broken power law with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with the break at @xmath41 erg s@xmath1 ( note that wp10 use @xmath42 , whereas we prefer to adopt @xmath43 ) so that the wp10 slopes are here increased by 1 ) .",
    "these parameter values are consistent with those derived with the  classical \" approach described above .",
    "we normalized the luminosity function at the local grb rate @xmath44 gpc@xmath45 yr@xmath1 ( wp10 ) .",

    "at the low end of the luminosity distribution of grbs , i.e. @xmath48 erg s@xmath1 , there are two events ( grb 980425 and grb 060218 ) which have been detected in the local universe and have been intensively studied as direct evidences of the massive star progenitor of long grbs .",
    "their luminosity is three orders of magnitude smaller than hl bursts , and their rate is larger ( e.g. soderberg et al .",

[ fg1 ] . since @xmath62 has been computed in 2006 , we have also corrected it ( blue asterisk with solid horizontal bar in fig .",
    "[ fg1 ] ) for the larger time interval elapsed since the detection of these two ll events .",
    "these results are consistent with numerical studies : virgili , liang & zhang ( 2009 ) estimate @xmath63=200 gpc@xmath45 yr@xmath1 for events with @xmath60 erg s@xmath1 based on the batse grb population . a slightly larger rate @xmath64700@xmath65360 gpc@xmath45 yr@xmath1 ( shown by the cyan filled square symbol in fig .",

    "due to the increased capability to measure the redshift of long gbrs , we have now better determination of their luminosity function , and indeed the results of different groups and of different methods start to converge .",
    "the lf can be modeled as a broken power law , with slopes @xmath671.21.5 and @xmath68 , and a break above @xmath69 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the degree of cosmic evolution is instead still uncertain ( see e.g. s12 ) . another controversial issue concerns low luminosity grbs .",
    "we have observed very few of them , but their vicinity points to a very large rate . from what we find , they lie on the extrapolation of the luminosity function that describes high luminosity events .",
    "this suggests that ll and hl bursts belong to the same population .",
    "ll bursts have luminosities of @xmath70 erg s@xmath1 and therefore extend the range of observed grb luminosities to seven orders of magnitude .",
    "is this very large range produced by the different intrinsic grb power or is it instead the result of viewing the same intrinsic phenomenon under different lines of sight ?",
    "we here discuss our findings , that are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab2 ] .    * if the jets of grbs are homogeneous and have a typical opening angle , then the observed luminosity is proportional to the energetics of the bursts after it has spent part of its initial energy to punch the progenitor star .",
    "this implies that the lf must be flat at low luminosities , and this contradicts the data .",
    "our conclusion is that we can exclude this simple case .",
    "* we have then examined the case of a homogeneous jet , but with a jet angle that is related to the grb energetics : smaller @xmath12 correspond to larger @xmath9 and @xmath23 .",
    "since low luminosity bursts have larger @xmath12 the probability that they intercept our line of sight is greater then that for high luminosity bursts : therefore the fraction of grbs that we detect at lower luminosities is greater than at large luminosities .",
    "if the  true \" lf is flat , the observed lf is instead decreasing towards larger @xmath23 with a slope that depends on the chosen relation between @xmath12 and @xmath23 .",
    "the latter can be inferred by the observed spectral energy correlations , that yields @xmath71 ( in the case of a circumburst wind density profile ) or @xmath72 ( homogeneous circumburst density ) . in this case",
    "we can obtain a reasonable agreement with the data in the entire luminosity range but the very low luminosities , where the model shows a small deficit .",
    "* in the third case the jet is still homogeneous , but it can be seen also off axis , for viewing angles @xmath73 .",
    "this is possible for @xmath24 not extreme , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg4 ] : the luminosity jump at @xmath74 is more pronounced for larger @xmath24 .",
    "the lf constructed with a single value of @xmath12 and @xmath24 do not fit the data , since they show an upturn at high luminosity instead of a steepening . on the other hand ,",
    "assuming some dispersion of @xmath12 and @xmath24 , we can obtain a reasonable agreement .",
    "the required average values are @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "what is remarkable is that the analytically predicted slope at intermediate luminosities is very close to what seen . *",
    "finally , we have investigated structured jets , of the form @xmath77 beyond a core angle @xmath78 . we have found that a good fit can be obtained , but only if the slope @xmath26 is rather steep , @xmath79 , with a preferred value @xmath80 .",
    "this is much steeper than the value @xmath81 originally proposed to explain the clustering of @xmath82 found by frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "these studies indicate that the jet must have a relatively sharp cut  off .",
    "even if an abrupt one is unphysical ( all the energy contained within @xmath12 , and zero outside ) , the energy must in any case decrease rapidly with the angle from the jet axis , once it it becomes greater than the core angle @xmath78 .",
    "the other important overall conclusion is that although the low luminosity bursts seem not to have enough energy to punch the progenitor star , they can nevertheless understood within the same framework of large luminosity grbs , as long as they have a larger jet angle , or they are seen off  axis . in the first case",
    "we see the little energy leftover after the jet break  out , in the latter case the apparent low luminosity is due to the large viewing angle , but the real energetics of these burst in much greater .",
