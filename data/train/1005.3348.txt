    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite has been useful in understanding time - dependent processes on both sides of the duality . on the gravity side , some insight has been obtained for time - dependent gravitational backgrounds like space - like singularities using the gauge theory dual @xcite .",
    "however , the correspondence has been most successful in the exploration of non - equilibrium properties of strongly coupled field theories at finite temperature and/or finite density using their gravity duals .",
    "the significant results in this area include the well known predictions for linear response functions @xcite . in recent years , however , this approach has been extended to the non - linear domain as well , e.g. in the derivation of non - linear fluid dynamics from gravity @xcite and in the study of thermalization in terms of the dual process of black hole formation @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting class of non - equilibrium problems involves time - dependent couplings or masses which pass through a critical point either at finite temperature or at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "this problem has experimental relevance in cold atom physics and has been studied theoretically in two extreme limits . in the first limit ,",
    "a parameter is changed quickly through a critical point ( a quantum quench ) and the subsequent time evolution is studied @xcite . in the other limit , the parameter changes slowly across a critical point @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "dynamical quantities have universal signatures of the critical point .",
    "there are , however , few conventional analytical tools to investigate such problems",
    ". it would be clearly interesting if gauge - gravity duality can be applied to such situations .    in this paper",
    "we take a small step in this direction .",
    "we investigate the dual bulk dynamics of a class of conformal field theories with time - dependent couplings , starting in an initial vacuum state . in known field theories , this is an interesting problem even when the couplings do not pass through a critical point .",
    "for example , if we start with a _ free _ massive field theory in its vacuum state and suddenly change the mass to a different value , the resulting real time correlation functions become thermal at late time @xcite .",
    "similar behavior can be established in some interacting field theories as well @xcite , but the tools for investigating such phenomena in strongly coupled theories are rather limited .",
    "when the field theory has a gravity ( as opposed to full fledged string ) dual , a time - dependent coupling corresponds to exciting a _ non - normalizable _ mode of the dual bulk field and calculating the time evolution .",
    "this is quite similar to the investigation of cosmological backgrounds in @xcite , forced fluid dynamics @xcite or black hole formation @xcite .",
    "however the class of field theories we consider are considerably simpler , and may have different applications .",
    "these are defect or flavored conformal field theories resulting from probe d - branes in a background space - time of the form of @xmath5 .",
    "such probe branes @xcite have been used to model flavor physics @xcite and quantum critical phenomena : this `` top - down '' approach @xcite is complementary to the `` bottom - up '' approach involving the physics of charged black holes in ads @xcite .",
    "one positive feature of this top - down approach is that in this case the dynamics of the probe branes describe the strongly coupled dynamics of a _ known _ field theory .",
    "furthermore , since the gravitational background is not altered in the probe limit , the entire dynamics is given by the worldvolume dynamics of the probe brane .",
    "solving this dynamics is usually easier than solving einstein equations .    in the following ,",
    "we will find nontrivial time - dependent classical solutions of several kinds of probe branes which represent time - dependent couplings of the dual defect conformal field theories .",
    "we find that the induced worldvolume metric on a large class of such classical solutions have apparent horizons characterized by a temperature in spite of the absence of black hole horizons in the ads bulk metric .",
    "in fact , small fluctuations of the worldvolume fields around these solutions behave like fields in space - times defined by this induced metric . from the point of view of the dual field theory ,",
    "this means that an initial vacuum state can evolve into a thermal state in the presence of time - dependent couplings .",
    "the emergence of apparent and event horizons on the worldvolume is somewhat similar to the emergence of an acoustic horizon for phonons around a supersonic fluid flow @xcite . indeed",
    ", this kind of phenomenon can occur in a large class of non - linear field theories @xcite .",
    "it is very important that in our probe approximation the dual field theory should be regarded as an _",
    "system_. consider such a setup in @xmath6 dual to the four - dimensional @xmath7 super yang - mills ( sym ) which couples to a defect or flavor conformal field theory ( see fig .  [ fig : noneqsystem ] ) .",
    "though the energy supplied by the time - dependent coupling first excites the defect or flavor sector , this energy will finally dissipate into the @xmath7 sym sector due to the interactions between each other . in the bulk description",
    "this means that energy can flow from the probe brane to the bulk gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed we find that typically the worldvolume apparent horizon evolves into an event horizon similar to that of a static black hole space - time only when the time derivative of the classical solution approaches a constant .",
    "in such a case , the long time correlators of fluctuations become thermal with the hawking temperature of the event horizon .",
    "this can be explicitly demonstrated for the cases where the fluctuations can be decoupled . for most cases , these fluctuations are coupled in a non - minimal way .",
    "however , one expects that correlators will still inherit the thermal behavior implied by the background metric .",
    "discussed in section 4 .",
    "the other cases can be interpreted in the same way after obvious modifications.,height=188 ]    in summary , our holographic setups can be regarded as an example of _ non - equilibrium steady states_. one of the most important non - equilibrium properties of our systems is that there are _ two different temperatures _ : one is the bulk temperature @xmath8 which is vanishing for pure ads and the other one is the hawking temperature @xmath9 of the apparent horizon of the induced metric of probe d - branes .",
    "the simplest example in our setups is a probe d - string or f - string extended along the radial direction of @xmath10 . in the dual @xmath7 sym theory",
    "this represents a monopole or a quark . in this case",
    "the relevant class of classical solutions can be found analytically . in these solutions ,",
    "the end - point spins along a direction on the @xmath11 leading to a wave moving along the string towards the poincare horizon . in the dual defect cft",
    "this corresponds to a certain time - dependent coupling of the hypermultiplet fields with @xmath7 vector multiplet fields @xcite .",
    "this generates a r - charge chemical potential only for the hypermultiplet and not for the @xmath7 sym sector . if we start with a static string in the far past and turn on the spin , an apparent horizon develops on the worldsheet .",
    "when the value of the spin approaches a constant at late times , the induced metric coincides with that of the btz metric with an angular coordinate suppressed .",
    "the hawking temperature of the event horizon is proportional to the final angular velocity @xmath12 , given by simply @xmath13 .",
    "fluctuations around this classical solution satisfy simple equations in this background metric leading to correlators which are thermal .",
    "in particular , this leads to a brownian motion of the end point . in the dual field theory",
    "this manifests itself as a brownian motion of the monopole position as well as a brownian motion in the internal space @xmath14 .",
    "when the string extends all the way to the boundary , the mass of the monopole or the quark is infinite .",
    "however terminating the string on a suitable space - filling d7-brane makes the mass finite .",
    "it should be again emphasized that this is a _ non - equilibrium _ situation : it is only the monopole or quark which behaves thermally while the other @xmath7 degrees of freedom are still at zero temperature .",
    "@xmath15 corrections will eventually thermalize the latter - but that requires going beyond the probe approximation .",
    "since we have an _ open _ system , energy can flow into the vector multiplet sector . in a closed system",
    ", we typically expect thermal behavior if the time dependence _ vanishes _ at late times .",
    "in contrast , in our case we need a steady time dependence to achieve thermality since energy can flow out of the defect cft at a constant rate .",
    "such brownian motion behavior has been observed for fluctuations around static strings in the background of ads black holes , i.e. when the field theory is already at some finite temperature @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the parent field theory is at zero temperature - an effective temperature is produced by a time - dependent coupling .",
    "the physics of other probe d - branes is quite similar , but requires a combination of analytical and numerical tools . for d3 ,",
    "d5 and d7-branes in the @xmath16 geometry , we find classical solutions with angular momenta dual to r - charges which lead to induced worldvolume metrics with horizons . for a probe d3-brane , which is dual to a ( @xmath17)-dimensional defect cft",
    ", we calculate the conductivity by turning on a worldvolume gauge field .",
    "there is a finite ac conductivity which arises from dissipation into the @xmath7 degrees of freedom .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed earlier using probe d - branes at finite temperature , i.e. in ads black hole backgrounds @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we observe this behavior in a zero temperature field theory where a time - dependent coupling effectively produces a thermal state . in the d7-brane case",
    ", we can rotate a d7-brane in the standard d3-d7 system @xcite dual to four - dimensional @xmath7 sym with a massive flavor hypermultiplet .",
    "this setup has been already discussed in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a similar analysis for d3-d5 system ) .",
    "this rotation excites a r - charge only in the hypermultiplet sector .",
    "we find that for a sufficiently large r - charge , the induced metric of the probe d7-brane has a horizon which surrounds a cusp - like singularity on the worldvolume .",
    "this structure looks very similar to the structure of the standard black holes in general relativity . as a final example , we holographically describe a time - dependent mass in the defect cft sector dual to a probe d5-brane . we numerically show that an apparent horizon is formed under a time - dependent change of mass , thus describing thermalization of the dual cft .",
    "in free field theory , it is known that the effective temperature after the quench depends on the momenta of each modes since they are decoupled with each other in free field theory @xcite .",
    "however , our holographic result predicts that this picture will be completely changed for the strongly interacting gauge theories . in the latter case _",
    "the different momentum modes observe a common temperature_.    it is also an intriguing problem to associate an entropy to such a d - brane with thermal horizon .",
    "we will show that one holographic candidate for such a entropy is divergent in general except in the lowest - dimensional case i.e. d1-brane case .",
    "we suggest that this might be interpreted as an entanglement entropy when we trace out the @xmath7 sym sector , though we would like to leave its detail for future work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we consider probe d@xmath1-branes which are extended in ads space - time and rotating in a sphere direction . we show that an apparent horizon is always formed in the poincare ads space .",
    "we calculate the energy dissipation in such systems . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the thermal property of the rotating d@xmath1-brane solutions constructed in section 2 .",
    "in particular , we will study brownian motion and thermal correlation functions for a probe d1-brane and the ac conductivity for a d3-brane . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the rotating d7-brane with a mass for flavor hypermultiplet .",
    "we will show that for a sufficiently fast rotation , the induced metric of the probe d7-brane has a horizon . in section 5 , we will give a brief analysis of a holographic dual of a quantum quench caused by a rapid change of a mass parameter in a defect cft .",
    "we consider a particular case of probe d5-brane and numerically show the appearance of an apparent horizon in the time - dependent induced worldvolume metric .",
    "typical setups of ads / cft correspondence are @xmath18 backgrounds in string theory or m - theory , where @xmath19 is the ( @xmath20)-dimensional ads space in poincare coordinates and @xmath21 is a @xmath22-dimensional einstein manifold @xcite . in this paper",
    "we mainly assume the simplest case @xmath23 .",

    "the d - brane systems we would like to consider now are d@xmath1-branes rotating in the @xmath27 directions .",
    "these rotations are dual to non - vanishing r - charges in cft@xmath28 .",
    "the equations of motion require that such d - branes should rotate along the largest circles in @xmath27 .",
    "below we will show that such d - brane systems can be regarded as mini black holes in ads spaces and they describe locally thermal vacua in a probe limit .",
