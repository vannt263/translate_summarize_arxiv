    "in a linear continuous - time dynamical system given by @xmath1 , if @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a real @xmath4 matrix with all eigenvalues distinct and having negative real parts , @xmath5 tends to zero exponentially fast as @xmath6 .",
    "the same phenomenon can be observed in nonlinear system @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 ) in a vicinity of hyperbolic fixed point , as long as the jacobian matrix of @xmath9 evaluated at the fixed point has only distinct eigenvalues with negative real parts .",
    "if , on the other hand , the matrix @xmath3 has degenerate ( repeated ) eigenvalues , the convergence to the fixed point can be polynomial - exponential , that is , of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a polynomial and @xmath12 .",
    "in discrete - time dynamical systems things are quite similar .",
    "for example , the linear system system @xmath13= \\left[\\begin{array}{rc }   0 & 1\\\\   -\\frac{1}{4 } & 1 \\end{array } \\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   x_{n}\\\\   y_{n } \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] is defined by a matrix which has degenerate ( double ) eigenvalue @xmath14 , thus polynomial - exponential ( linear - exponential in this case ) convergence to the fixed point @xmath15 is expected .",
    "indeed , the solution is @xmath16=\\left(\\frac{1}{2 } \\right)^n \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }   1-n & 2n\\\\   -\\frac{n}{2 } & 1+n \\end{array } \\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   x_{0}\\\\   y_{0 } \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] and we can clearly see the aforementioned linear - exponential convergence .",
    "cellular automata are infinitely - dimensional dynamical systems , yet a behaviour similar to hyperbolicity in finite - dimensional systems has been observed in many of them .",
    "in particular , in some binary cellular automata in one dimension , known as _ asymptotic emulators of identity _ , if the initial configuration is drawn from a bernoulli distribution , the expected proportion of ones ( or zeros ) tends to its stationary value exponentially fast @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an example of a probabilistic ca has been recently found @xcite where the density of ones converges to its stationary value in a linear - exponential fashion , just like in the case of degenerate hyperbolic fixed points in finite - dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "could such behaviour be observed in _",
    "deterministic _ ca as well ?",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide an example of such deterministic ca .",
    "we will consider 3-state nearest - neighbour ca obtained from elementary binary ca by `` lifting '' them to 3-states .",
    "what we mean by this is the following construction .",
    "let @xmath17 be a local function of elementary ca satisfying @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and let @xmath20 be defined by @xmath21 this construction ensures that when @xmath22 is restricted to two symbols only , it becomes equivalent to @xmath23 , otherwise it behaves as identity .",

    "we studied dynamics of @xmath22 for a number of elementary rules @xmath23 .",
    "one of the most interesting of them is the case of @xmath23 being elementary ca rule with wolfram number 140 , defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 . as we will see , it actually exhibits degenerate hyperbolicity . in",

    "let the _ density polynomial _ associated with a string @xmath44 be defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of occurrences of symbol @xmath47 in @xmath39",
    ". if @xmath3 is a set of strings , we define density polynomial associated with @xmath3 as @xmath48    one can easily show ( in a manner similar as done in @xcite ) that if one starts with a bi - infinite string of symbols drawn from bernoulli distribution where probabilities of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , then the proportion of sites in state @xmath53 after @xmath0 iterations of rule @xmath27 is given by @xmath54 .",
