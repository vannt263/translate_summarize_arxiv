    "low - dimensional layered organic conductors are a promising class of materials that exhibit high temperature superconductivity . among them , an antiferromagnetic dimer - mott ( dm ) insulator @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 , which shows superconductivity at 14.2 k under high pressure ( @xmath38 gpa ) @xcite , has aroused great interests because its transition temperature is highest among organic superconductors known to date . at ambient pressure , @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 is a dm insulator with an antiferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath4 of 22 k @xcite .",
    "as typically seen in bandwidth - controlled mott transition systems such as @xmath5-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1@xmath6 , where @xmath6 = cu@xmath1(cn)@xmath7 , cu[n(cn)@xmath1](br , cl ) @xcite , @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 also exhibits superconductivity when the antiferromagnetic phase is suppressed by applying pressure .",
    "it has been , therefore , believed that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation plays an essential role in the high-@xmath9 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the crystal structure of @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 consists of an alternating stack of the conductive bedt - ttf layers and insulating icl@xmath1 layers along the @xmath10 axis as shown in fig.1(a ) @xcite .",
    "although the charge transfer between these layers leads to a 3/4-filled band system , due to strong dimerization of two bedt - ttf molecules , the 3/4-filled band splits into bonding and antibonding bands , resulting in an effective half - filled band system [ see figs.1(b ) and 1(c ) ] .",
    "the effective model to describe the electronic state is therefore considered to be the half - filled hubbard model , in which each dimer is regarded as a unit , and charge degrees of freedom inside of dimers are disregarded . according to band structure calculations @xcite",
    ", @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 has a quasi ",
    "one - dimensional ( q1d ) electronic structure with a pair of slightly warped open fermi surfaces owing to the cancelation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 [ see fig.1(b ) ] . this material , however , becomes a mott insulator due to the strong on - dimer coulomb repulsion @xmath13 .",
    "thus , @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 has been considered to be a typical q1d dm insulator with one hole per each dimerized molecules at ambient pressure .    however , unlike @xmath5-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1@xmath6 , the phase diagram of @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 under pressure simply can not be accounted for within the framework of the bandwidth - controlled mott transition system .",
    "recent @xmath14c nmr measurements under pressure up to 3 gpa @xcite have revealed that the antiferromagnetic moment of 1@xmath15/dimer at ambient pressure , which is a hallmark of a dm insulator , decreases to 0.5@xmath15/dimer at 0.6 gpa .",
    "this result implies that the dm insulator picture of @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 may be violated under high pressure . indeed , first - principles band structure calculations @xcite have pointed out that the degree of dimerization is significantly reduced with increasing pressure , suggesting that the electronic structure of @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 changes from the effective half - filled to a 3/4-filled band system under pressure .",
    "in this situation , the effective model should be the 3/4-filled extended hubbard model that takes into account the charge degrees of freedom inside of dimers and interdimer coulomb interactions .",
    "recent theoretical calculations based on the extended hubbard model @xcite have revealed that in weakly dimerized systems both charge and spin fluctuations play an important role in unconventional superconductivity , pointing out the need to revisit the pairing mechanism that drive the high-@xmath9 superconductivity of @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 . since a detailed knowledge of the electronic structure is an essential starting point for understanding the superconducting pairing mechanism , experimental studies on the electronic structure of @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 under high pressure",

    "two small samples with flat surfaces were placed on the culet face of the diamond anvil with a small amount of apiezon m grease . to perform accurate measurements of the reflectivity for tiny samples , synchrotron radiation light at bl43ir in spring-8 was used . in this study , to obtain good hydrostaticity , we used glycerin as the pressure transmitting medium , which produces more hydrostatic pressure than solid media such as kbr and nacl @xcite .",

    "a large anisotropy of the reflectivity is clearly observed , reflecting the strong 1d electronic structure of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 .",

    ", however , a peak structure centered at 3000 @xmath24 becomes sharper , which makes it clearer that the spectra for @xmath22 consists of two bands located at 3000 @xmath24 and 4000 @xmath24 .",
    "in sharp contrast , @xmath30 for @xmath23 exhibits very low conductivity , reflecting the 1d nature of the electronic structure as was expected in the reflectivity spectra .    in a dm insulator",
    ", there are two absorption bands in the mid - ir region : the so - called hubbard and dimer bands corresponding to the inter- and intradimer charge transfers , respectively [ see fig.1(c ) ] .",
    "the excitation energy of the interdimer charge transfer , @xmath31 , is given by the effective on - dimer coulomb interaction , @xmath13 , which causes splitting of the antibonding band .",
    "in the extended hubbard model , the effective on - dimer coulomb interaction , @xmath13 , is represented by @xmath32 , where @xmath17 is the on - molecule coulomb interaction , @xmath18 is the intradimer coulomb interaction , and @xmath33 is the intradimer transfer integral @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the excitation energy of the intradimer charge transfer , @xmath34 , is given by @xmath35 in the strong dimerization limit ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath36 @xmath37 ) .",
    "recent band structure calculations based on the maximally localized wannier orbitals ( mlwo ) for a series of dimerized hall - filled organic salts @xcite have a remarkable development in estimates of model parameters .",
    "the calculations based on the mlwo for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 have estimated the intradimer charge transfer @xmath35 @xmath38 @xmath39 to be 500 mev ( which corresponds to approximately 4000 @xmath24 ) , showing an excellent agreement with the experimental value of 4000 @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the band at 4000 @xmath24 is assigned to the dimer band . on the other hand ,",
    "the band at 3000 @xmath24 is characterized by the sharpness ; it s much sharper than that of the 2d @xmath5-type system @xcite , which reflects the narrow density of states in the 1d mott insulator @xcite .",
    "this fact strongly supports that the band at 4000 @xmath24 is assigned to the hubbard band . in the strong dimerization limit , the central frequency of the hubbard band becomes smaller than that of the dimer band [ see fig.4(e ) for details ] .",
    "therefore , the present result that the excitation energy of the hubbard band transition is lower than that of the dimer band transition indicates that @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 is located in the strong dimerization regime at ambient pressure .      in order to elucidate the pressure evolution of @xmath30 ,",
    "the polarized reflectivity measurements under high pressure were performed by using a dac . in a dac , the reflectivity is measured at a sample / diamond interface , not at a sample / vacuum interface [ see fig.2(b ) ] .",
    "therefore the large refractive index of diamond ( @xmath32.4 ) makes a difference between the spectra measured in a dac and vacuum , @xmath40 and @xmath28 ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "in addition to this , multiple reflections in a thin layer of apiezon m grease between the sample and diamond also affects the @xmath40 spectra .",
    "our analysis considering the above corrections have shown that the thickness of the thin layer of apiezon m grease is about 300 - 400 nm .",
    "figure2(a ) shows the @xmath40 spectra for @xmath22 expected from @xmath28 measured in vacuum at ambient pressure , which well reproduces @xmath40 actually measured at a low pressure of 0.54 gpa [ see fig.2(c ) ] .    .",

    "( b ) optical conductivity spectra obtained from the fitting analysis for @xmath23 .",
    "the spectra are offset for clarity . ]    to extract @xmath30 from the measured @xmath40 spectra , we fit @xmath40 to a lorentz oscillator model ( see appendix for details ) .",
    "we show examples of the fitting for @xmath22 and @xmath41 in figs.2(c)-(f ) and fig.3(a ) , respectively .",
    "the measured @xmath40 is well reproduced by two lorentz oscillators in the mid - ir region , as well as several sharp phonons below @xmath31500 @xmath24 in the case of @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding optical conductivity spectra for @xmath22 and @xmath41 obtained from the fitting analysis are shown in figs.2(g)-(j ) and fig.3(b ) , respectively . at 0.54 gpa ,",
    "@xmath30 for @xmath22 exhibits very similar behavior to that of ambient pressure ; the hubbard and dimer bands have been observed in the mid - ir region .",
    "with further increase in pressure , the hubbard band becomes broader as shown in figs.2(h)-(j ) , but the central frequency does nt change so much with pressure . in sharp contrast , the dimer band shifts to much lower frequencies between 0.54 gpa and 2.9 gpa , and with increasing pressure the spectral weight ( sw ) becomes much larger .          to clarify the pressure evolutions of the hubbard and dimer bands , we plot the pressure dependence of the central frequencies and sws of each band in figs.4(a ) and 4(b ) . between 0.54 gpa and 2.9 gpa ,",
    "the central frequency of the dimer band rapidly decreases .",
    "in contrast , the pressure dependence of the hubbard band is gentle compared to that of the dimer band . as a result , above 2.9 gpa , the central frequency of the dimer band becomes lower than that of the hubbard band .",
    "as mentioned above , in the strong dimerization limit , the central frequency of the hubbard band should be smaller than that of the dimer band .",
    "the present result therefore indicates that the simple dm insulator picture of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 has been violated above 2.9 gpa .",
    "recent theoretical calculations based on the extended hubbard model @xcite have suggested that by weakening the degree of dimerization or by increasing the interdimer coulomb interaction , the dm insulating state can be suppressed and evolve into a co insulating state , where the electronic charge distributions are polarized inside of dimers [ see the schematic phase diagram of fig.4(d ) ] . according to the calculations ,",
    "the intradimer charge transfer corresponding to the dimer band transition significantly softens compared to @xmath42 approaching the phase boundary between the dm and co insulating phases , resulting in a collective excitation @xcite . on the other hand , the hubbard band transition smoothly evolves into a charge transfer excitation induced by the inter - site coulomb interaction @xmath43 , as indeed observed in quarter - filled organic conductors in a co phase @xcite . very importantly , in this situation , the excitation energy of the dimer band transition can be smaller than that of the hubbard band transition .",
    "in the light of this fact , the present result for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 that the excitation energy of the dimer band transition becomes smaller than that of the hubbard band under pressure strongly suggests that the electronic structure of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 changes from effective half - filled to 3/4-filled as a result of weakening of dimerization with increasing pressure .",
    "such a decrease of dimerization under pressure has been discussed also in ( tmttf)@xmath1@xmath6 salts @xcite .    under pressure , in addition to weakening of dimerization , an increase of the bandwidth has been observed .",
    "figure4(c ) shows the pressure dependence of the total sws for @xmath22 and @xmath41 at the lowest temperature . the total sw continuously increases with increasing pressure for both polarization directions , reflecting the increase in the bandwidth due to the increase in the transfer integrals . therefore in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 ,",
    "when the pressure is applied , the system would follow the track as sketched in fig.4(d ) .",
    "what is remarkable here is that the system crosses the vicinity of the co phase , which can be associated with the superconducting pairing mechanism of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 as discussed later . in the case of @xmath5-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1@xmath6",
    ", a slight application of pressure ( @xmath44 0.1 gpa ) induces a mott transition .",
    "thus , the degree of dimerization is almost unchanged in the low - pressure region , so that the system remains in the strong dimerization limit .",
    "indeed , this has been confirmed by the chemical pressure studies for @xmath5-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu[n(cn)@xmath1]br@xmath45cl@xmath46 @xcite , in which the central frequencies of neither the hubbard nor the dimer bands change with @xmath47 , indicating that the system is located far away from the co phase .",
    "another important finding in this study is that the sw for @xmath41 significantly increases with increasing pressure .",
    "the total sw for @xmath41 at 8.5 gpa becomes twice compared to that at ambient pressure , whereas for @xmath22 it increases only by 25% .",
    "consequently , the anisotropy of the total sw becomes smaller .",
    "this result indicates that the dimensionality of the electronic structure of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 evolves from q1d to 2d with increasing pressure .",
    "according to the previous theoretical studies based on the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation including only the on - site coulomb interaction @xcite , with increasing pressure the nesting condition of the fermi surface becomes degraded owing to the dimensional crossover of the fermi surface . as a result , the magnetic structure described by the localized spins in the strongly correlated mott insulating state changes into an itinerant sdw state .",
    "with further increase in pressure , @xmath4 decreases and the antiferromagnetic phase can be suppressed .",
    "finally , unconventional superconductivity with @xmath48-wave symmetry emerges .",
    "thus , the origin of the superconductivity of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 is considered to be associated with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation . however , in the above calculations , intra- and interdimer coulomb interactions are not included .",
    "our present study highlights the 3/4-filled nature of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 under pressure , in which the intradimer charge degrees of freedom and interdimer coulomb interactions become more important .",
    "recent theoretical calculations analyzed by the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and flex based on the extended hubbard model @xcite have pointed out that the superconducting phase appears near the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) phase as well as the sdw phase .",
    "while the extended @xmath49-wave pairing symmetry is favored near the cdw phase , @xmath48-wave superconductivity is realized due to spin fluctuation near the sdw phase . since both superconducting gap",
    "symmetries are classified by @xmath50 irreducible representation , the two superconducting states are cooperative with each other",
    ". then charge fluctuation inside of dimers can enhance the spin - fluctuation induced superconductivity . in this context , the present experimental results for @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 suggest that in addition to antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation , charge fluctuation plays an important role in the high-@xmath9 superconductivity of @xmath2-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 .",
    "finally , we compare the @xmath51-@xmath52 phase diagrams obtained in the present study and the previous resistivity measurements using a cubic anvil cell @xcite .",
    "according to the resistivity measurements , @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 shows superconductivity above @xmath37 gpa , and @xmath9 reaches 14.2 k at 8.2 gpa [ see fig.4(e ) ] .",
    "in the present study , we have focused on the mid - ir region , so we can not discuss details of the electronic structure near the fermi level such as a drude peak .",
    "however , the optical response in the low - energy region below @xmath31000 @xmath24 seems to capture the features associated with the electronic structure near the fermi level . below 2.9 gpa , @xmath40 in the low - energy region",
    "does nt change so much with temperature , reflecting the large optical gap independent of temperature . at 5.9 gpa",
    ", however , @xmath40 in the low - energy region slightly increases with decreasing temperature from room temperature , and below 200 k it decreases with decreasing temperature and becomes temperature - independent below 100 k. this result indicates that the metal - insulator ( mi ) transition at 5.9 gpa occurs at about 200 k , which is consistent with the @xmath51-@xmath52 phase diagram obtained from the resistivity measurements . at 8.5 gpa , @xmath40 in the low - energy region increases with decreasing temperature and exhibits a maximum at 80 k , which suggests that the mi transition occurs at @xmath380 k. this implies that the highest pressure we reached corresponds to about 7 gpa in the @xmath51-@xmath52 phase diagram obtained from the resistivity measurements .",
    "the discrepancy between the present study and the resistivity measurements may come from a difference in the hydrostatic stress conditions .",
    "the magnetic properties of the low - temperature magnetically ordered phase have been investigated up to 3 gpa by the @xmath14c nmr measurements @xcite .",
    "although we measured the optical conductivity down to low temperatures at each pressure , a clear difference in the optical spectra above and below the magnetic transition has not been observed .",
    "this is because the electronic excitations associated with the hubbard and dimer bands are not largely affected by the magnetic order .",
    "the experimental result that there is no large temperature variation at low temperatures in the optical spectra at 2.9 gpa and 5.9 gpa suggests that the system does nt enter an insulating state such as a co phase that drastically changes the electronic structure in the mid - ir region . therefore the antiferromagnetic mott insulating phase or the sdw phase should be realized in the low - temperature region above 3 gpa , as discussed above .",
    "further experimental studies on the magnetic properties under higher pressures are desired .",
    "in summary , we have performed optical conductivity measurements for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 under high pressure . at ambient pressure , two characteristic bands due to intra- and interdimer charge transfers have been observed in the optical spectra only for the polarization along the stacks of bedt - ttf molecules , strongly supporting that this salt is a q1d dm insulator at ambient pressure . with increasing pressure ,",
    "however , the intradimer charge excitation shifts to much lower frequencies as a result of weakening of dimerization , implying that the electronic structure evolves from effective half - filled into 3/4-filled under pressure .",
    "moreover , we have shown that the dimensionality of the electronic structure switches from q1d to 2d , in which the high temperature superconductivity emerges .",
    "these results indicate that the phase diagram of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 is different from that of @xmath5-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1@xmath6 where the superconducting phase appears in the effective half - filled band system .",

    "we show the fitting results for @xmath22 and @xmath41 in figs.2(c)-(f ) and fig.3(a ) , respectively .",

    "however , the direction of polarization and the @xmath26 axis are not perfectly perpendicular to each other , so the same acoustic mode should be observable in the polarization of @xmath41 in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1icl@xmath1 ."

    "<S> , two characteristic bands due to intra- and interdimer charge transfers have been observed in the ir spectra , supporting that this salt is a typical half - filled dm insulator at ambient pressure . with increasing pressure , however , the intradimer charge transfer excitation shifts to much lower energies , indicating that the effective electronic state changes from half - filled to 3/4-filled as a result of weakening of dimerization . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the system approaches a charge - ordered state under high pressure , in which charge degrees of freedom emerge as an important factor . </S>",
