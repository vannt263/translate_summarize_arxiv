    "[ fig : finitet](b ) and ( c ) ] the amplitude of the symmetrically arranged peaks in the clover - like pattern decreases and becomes negative while the height of the anti - symmetrically arranged peaks remains constant .",
    "here , we observe that finite temperatures break the @xmath119 rotation symmetry of the cross - noise pattern . for @xmath120 , the crossed noise also shows a clover - like pattern , but now with negative height for symmetric and positive height for anti - symmetric dot levels .",
    "we attribute the negative cross - correlations for symmetric dot levels @xmath121 to resonant tunneling of electrons and holes . for antisymmetric",
    "dot levels @xmath122 , this resonant tunneling is suppressed and car with zero total cooper pair energy is enhanced , giving rise to positive cross - correlations .    above we found that for @xmath123 the crossed noise is significantly reduced when at least one of the dot levels lies at the chemical potential of the superconductor . for @xmath124 ,",
    "this suppression becomes complete with vanishing crossed noise along the lines @xmath44 and @xmath83 .",
    "for zero temperature , we find the maxima of the clover - like pattern at @xmath132 with amplitude @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "this analytical result is exact for zero temperature .",
    "however , for finite temperatures the crossed noise is still proportional to the majorana energy splitting @xmath11 which is also confirmed by the numerics in fig .",
    "[ fig : noise_em ] where we plot the mbs mediated cross noise as function of @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , we find that the cross correlations vanish for vanishing majorana energy splitting independent of temperature .      for cross correlations induced by the standard superconducting proximity effect , we find for the case @xmath136 a maximum along @xmath137 with amplitude @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "thus , the current cross correlations vanish for @xmath42 similarly to the mbs case .      in the main part of this paper , we investigated the competition between cross correlations mediated by the superconducting proximity effect and mbs .",
    "in this section , we study the effect of additional transverse channels @xmath140 in the nanowire and estimate a critical channel number for which the cross correlations induced by the proximity effect and the mbs are equal .",
    "the coupling hamiltonian between a multichannel wire and a quantum dot can be written as @xmath141 where @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) denotes the annihilation operator for the dot ( wire at site @xmath144 ) and @xmath112 the coupling matrix element .",
    "we decompose the operator @xmath143 into mbs and delocalized states , @xmath145 where @xmath146 denotes the operator for an electron with transverse channel index @xmath147 and longitudinal momentum @xmath148 .",
    "if the energy difference between the subbands is larger than the superconducting gap , we write the coupling hamiltonian eq .   as sum of the coupling between the dot and the mbs and the coupling between the dot and the bogoliubov quasiparticles , @xmath149",
    "hence , we find that the dot - mbs coupling strength is @xmath150 and the dot - quasiparticle coupling strength is @xmath151 .    in the previous subsection , we determined the amplitude of the current cross correlations mediated by mbs and the sc proximity effect . using this result ,",
    "we find that the relative strength of the majorana and the proximity induced cross noise is determined by the ratio of eqs . and .",
    "there , the majorana energy splitting is @xmath152 and the proximity induced pairing potential is @xmath153 where @xmath30 denotes the fermi momentum , @xmath154 the sc gap , and @xmath155 the normal state density of states of the nanowire [ ] . with @xmath111 denoting the fermi velocity and @xmath140 denoting the number of partially occupied transverse channels , this yields @xmath156 for observation of the clover like pattern in the current cross - correlations , we demand that the mbs mediated cross noise is larger than the one mediated by the superconducting proximity effect , i.e. @xmath157 . in this way",
    ", we obtain the condition that @xmath158      we consider the hamiltonian describing a narrow semiconductor nanowire with strong spin - orbit coupling which is predicted to host majorana bound states  [ - ] , @xmath159 where @xmath160 creates an electron at @xmath161 with spin @xmath162 , @xmath163 denotes the effective band mass of the electrons in the nanowire , @xmath164 the chemical potential , @xmath165 the zeeman energy due to an external magnetic field , @xmath166 the rashba velocity related to the spin - orbit coupling , and @xmath154 the proximity induced @xmath33-wave pairing potential .",

    "can be mapped onto the spinless sc hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 10 ) which we use in the main part of this paper .",
    "the effective parameters used in the main part are the result of such a mapping , using realistic parameters for inas and insb nanowires and @xmath171 . without loss of generality , we assume spin polarized quantum dots with spin @xmath172 only . in our numerics we consider a nanowire of length @xmath173 nm and width 70 nm . for the above parameters ,",
    "the superconducting coherence length is @xmath174 nm .      in the following , we study the current cross correlations for different numbers of transverse channels and investigate the effect of both disorder and small changes of the chemical potential on the clover - like pattern found in the main part of the paper .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the influence of small changes of the chemical potential on the current cross correlations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_mu_lines ] , we plot the two lowest quasiparticle energies for hamiltonian eq .  .",

    "such a state always exists if an odd number of subbands is partially occupied . as function of the chemical potential the majorana energy splitting oscillates with period @xmath115 and with energy minima of @xmath176 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscillation ] , we plot the current cross correlations for two values of the chemical potential for which the majorana energy splitting has a local maximum and a local minimum . we find that the patterns in the current cross correlations are very different in the two cases , with a clover - like pattern for @xmath183 and an ellipsoidal pattern for @xmath176 .",
    "this is in full agreement with our findings that the majorana induced current cross correlations are proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we conclude that small variations of the chemical potential can be used as a tool to switch between different patterns of current cross - correlations",
    ". such a switching mechanism does not exist in the topologically trivial phase and is thus a signature for majorana bound states with oscillating majorana energy splitting .",
    "the change of the chemical potential can be realized by applying a global gate voltage .",
    "an alternative route to demonstrate the oscillations is a change of the magnetic field which gives rise to oscillation of periodicity @xmath184 .    above",
    "we have discussed that the proximity induced pairing oscillates as function of @xmath185 which changes when changing the chemical potential . however , for the standard proximity coupling in semiconductor nanowires we do not find a unique fermi momentum because of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "thus the oscillation of the proximity induced pairing potential is smeared out and we always find a non - zero contribution of the superconducting proximity effect to the crossed noise .        due to the finite extension of the nanowire in @xmath190-direction , we expect to find a multi - band system where the bands have a separation of several mev .",
    "for an even number of occupied transverse channels , the wire is in the topologically trivial phase , i.e. the majorana bound states are absent and thus we find a single ellipsoidal cross - noise pattern similar to the one in fig .",
    "4 of the main part of this paper where we studied the current cross correlations through a pair of quantum dots with superconducting pairing . for an odd number of occupied transverse channels , the wire is in the topologically non - trivial phase with majorana end states . in fig .",
    "[ fig : threeband ] , current cross correlations are shown for @xmath188 mev and width 70 nm which corresponds to the three - band case and for @xmath189 mev and width 90 nm which corresponds to the five - band case . in both case",
    ", we still find the characteristic four leaf clover - like pattern in current cross - correlations , similar to the single - band case .",
    "however , the amount of noise for @xmath48 is increased by a factor of @xmath191 in the three - band system as compared to the one - band case , as expected from the estimate eq .  .",
    "this numerical finding confirms our analytical result eq .   that the clover - like pattern is not restricted to the single - band wire and can also be found in multi - band wires .      in this section",
    ", we consider a spatially fluctuating chemical potential with mean value @xmath192 and random variations @xmath193 with @xmath194 . in figs .",

    "the physical conditions under which the diagonalized master equation approach is justified are ( i ) that the bath correlation time is small compared to the relaxation time of the dot - mbs - dot system , i.e. weak coupling between the leads and the dot - mbs - dot system @xmath203 , and ( ii ) that the excitation energies @xmath204 within each parity sector are large compared to @xmath76 [ ] . for @xmath176 , the states with different parity are always degenerate , which should be unproblematic since the coherent superposition between these states is unimportant for electronic transport .",
    "however , for energies @xmath205 , lls find in their eq .",
    "( 16 ) an additional degeneracy of the two lowest lying states in each sector , which is problematic since it violates condition ( ii ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that for the energy spectrum used by lls the diagonalized rate equation approach is not appropriate in the vicinity of this point .    nonetheless , if one forgoes the question of whether the diagonalized master equation approach is applicable , we can compare the single - particle energy spectrum we find by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations with the many - particle energy spectrum discussed by lls when diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the eight - dimensional many - body fock space . since parity is a good quantum number for the isolated dot - mbs - dot system ,",
    "it is possible to decompose the fock space into two four - dimensional subspaces with even and odd parity , and to diagonalize the hamiltonian in each subspace separately .",
    "then , the ground state is given by the vector with lowest energy , and the parity changing excitations are described by many - body wave functions with a parity different from that of the ground state . in particular , for @xmath205 and @xmath206 , lls find in their eq .",
    "( 16 ) that the states for even and odd parity are degenerate , and that each sector has energies @xmath207 .",
    "thus , the excitation energies for parity changing excitations of the ground state are @xmath208 .",
    "in contrast , in our manuscript we use the bdg formalism to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "the bdg formalism is a single - particle formalism based on the single - particle schrdinger equation and describes quasiparticle excitations above the ground state . since the bdg formalism doubles the physical hilbert space , only three out of the six eigenvalues obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( 2 ) are independent solutions .",
    "excited states can be constructed by adding one quasiparticle ( three possible states ) , two quasiparticles ( three possible states ) , or three quasiparticles ( one state ) .",
    "thus , together with the ground state , these states span an eight - dimensional fock space , in agreement with lls . using the bdg formalism",
    ", we find for parameters @xmath205 the single - particle excitation energies @xmath209 , and as a consequence the three - particle excitation energy @xmath210 .",
    "thus , the energy difference between the many - body ground state and parity changing excited states should be @xmath211 , different from the excitation spectrum obtained above by using the energies of lls .",
    "this discrepancy in the energy spectrum casts additional doubt on the results of lls and their interpretation .",
    "in addition , even when using the correct energy spectrum , there exist degeneracies between excited states within each parity sector for the choice of parameters @xmath212 , where the current cross - correlations are strongest .",
    "therefore , it seems that the applicability of the diagonalized rate equation approach to the dot - mbs - dot system is limited .",

    "<S> , @xmath75 has a single peak of height @xmath91 near @xmath48 , with width @xmath76 along the direction @xmath78 , and width @xmath92 along the direction @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the mbs case , there is no additional structure in this peak .    in figure  [ fig : s12_large_swave](b ) , we consider the combined hamiltonian @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a four - leaf clover feature similar to that in the majorana only case , with the center of this feature now having a peak due to the proximity term in @xmath27 . from this , we conclude that the contributions from the proximity effect and the mbs mediated car approximately add up . the relative peak heights in the crossed current correlator reflect the ratio of @xmath94 and @xmath11 .    _ microscopic model_. we complement our calculations by the analysis of a microscopic model for a spinless @xmath0-wave sc with hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath95 where the @xmath96 annihilate a spinless fermion on site @xmath97 with nearest neighbor hopping @xmath98 and nearest neighbor pairing amplitude @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this model describes the low - energy physics of a nanowire in the topologically nontrivial phase . in the numerical analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we use the parameters @xmath100 nm for the wire length , @xmath101 sites , @xmath102 mev , @xmath103 mev , and @xmath104 mev , similar to the parameters used in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these parameter values yield the sc gap @xmath105 mev and the majorana energy splitting @xmath106 mev . for the coupling of the operators @xmath107 and @xmath108 to the dots , we use @xmath109 mev . the results for this model agree very well with those for the effective model eq .  </S>",
    "<S> , see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s12_mbs_low ] and [ fig : s12_mbs_large ] . by introducing a finite wire width </S>",
    "<S> , we generalized this model to multichannel @xmath0-wave scs where the clover - like pattern remains for transverse channel number @xmath110 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath111 is the fermi velocity and @xmath112 the wire - dot coupling strength . for the parameters used in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s12_mbs_large](b ) , this yields the condition @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that the clover - like pattern is robust against disorder of strength @xmath114 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the majorana energy splitting @xmath3 is oscillating as function of the chemical potential with periodicity @xmath115 when neglecting the long - range coulomb interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the minima of @xmath116 are zero , the majorana induced current cross correlations vanish . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the chemical potential can be used to switch the crossed noise between the clover - like pattern [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s12_mbs_large ] ] and the ellipsoidal pattern [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : s12_large_swave ] ] . in the experiment </S>",
    "<S> this variation of the chemical potential can be realized by applying a global gate voltage to the topologically non - trivial sector of the nanowire .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion_. the non - locality of a pair of majorana bound states can be probed by crossed andreev reflection , whose observation is facilitated when suppressing local andreev reflection with the help of two resonant qds . in the case of a weak coupling between qds and leads </S>",
    "<S> , we find a set of discrete transmission resonances . </S>",
    "<S> when at least one of the qd levels is tuned to the chemical potential of the superconductor , a zero - energy majorana state forms in the respective qd , which contributes only weakly to crossed andreev reflection . </S>",
    "<S> this feature survives in the limit of strong dot - lead coupling , giving rise to a clover - like modulation of crossed shot noise as a function of qd energies , which is different from the single peak found without majorana states .    </S>",
