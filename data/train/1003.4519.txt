    "large scale coherent magnetic fields are observed in our milky way and in external galaxies @xcite ; these fields play crucial roles in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium ( ism )  they help to exert pressure to balance ordinary matter against gravity and trigger star formation , they are also responsible for the confinement of cosmic rays , and they can regulate and trace a large scale galactic wind .",
    "therefore , to better understand galaxy evolution , it is necessary to investigate the structure , origin and evolution of galactic magnetic fields .",
    "the primordial theory and the dynamo theory are the two possible explanations for the existence of a galactic scale magnetic field .",
    "these two theories make certain predictions on the symmetry of the large scale magnetic field with respect to the rotation axis and the mid - plane of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the characterization of the overall magnetic field geometry of a galaxy allows one to distinguish between various primordial and dynamo models .",
    "studies of the large scale magnetic field geometry in the milky way have been mainly focused on the disk field symmetry with respect to the rotation axis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even though sight lines towards high galactic latitude may be less turbulent and have less tangled fields than are seen in the galactic plane and hence global field patterns can be identified more easily . the strength and",
    "the symmetry of the vertical , azimuthal and radial components of the galactic magnetic field across the plane can provide us with unique insights on the mechanisms which maintain the galactic magnetic field .",
    "for example , a reversal across the galactic plane , in the azimuthal component of the large - scale magnetic field but not in its vertical component would indicate a field of dipolar structure , which could result from weak differential rotation ( near solid body rotation ) @xcite ; or a substantial primordial field @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is a reversal in the vertical but not the azimuthal component across the mid - plane , it would indicate a field of quadrupolar structure resulting from dynamo action due to differential rotation in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the dynamo theory predicts a weak vertical field compared to the horizontal field on galactic scales . if the measured large - scale vertical field strength is substantially larger , it could imply a primordial component to the galactic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the vertical to horizontal field strength also regulates the confinement of cosmic rays to the galactic disk , which can help us better understand the disk - halo interaction in the milky way .",
    "some information on the large scale structure of the galactic magnetic field can come from optical starlight polarization and radio synchrotron polarization ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a summary ) .",
    "a series of papers : @xcite found that towards the south galactic pole , the polarization of stars traces a field orientation along @xmath9 of 80@xmath10 which is parallel to the local spiral arm field , while the same field direction could not be traced towards the north galactic pole .",
    "most of our knowledge of the geometry of the large - scale galactic magnetic field to date comes from the faraday rotation measure of distant extragalactic radio sources ( egss ) and pulsars .",
    "faraday rotation is a birefringence effect when linearly polarized light travels through a magnetized media .",
    "the plane of the polarization rotates through an angle @xmath11@xmath12 ( in radians ) given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wavelength of the radiation measured in meters and rm is the rotation measure , defined as the integral of the line of sight magnetic field @xmath15 ( in @xmath8 g ) weighted by the thermal electron density @xmath16 ( in @xmath17 ) over a line - of - sight line element @xmath18@xmath19 ( in pc ) .",
    "@xmath20 the sign of the rm gives the direction of the line of sight component of the average field : a negative rm represents a magnetic field whose line of sight component is directed away from us . with independent knowledge of the thermal electron density",
    ", one can determine the average line - of - sight magnetic field strength .",
    "faraday rotation is complementary to other measurement techniques since rms provide the direction of the magnetic field , while most other techniques ( apart from zeeman splitting ) provide the field orientation , but not its direction .",
    "high latitude magnetic fields in the milky way have been investigated using rms of egss by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they all found a strong antisymmetric rm pattern between the northern and southern galactic hemispheres .",
    "these authors attribute the pattern to a horizontal magnetic field that reverses direction above and below the galactic plane . @xcite and",
    "@xcite estimated the local vertical magnetic field strength to be @xmath21 0.3 @xmath8 g , pointing from the south to the north galactic pole assuming a priori a dipolar field geometry . a wavelet analysis on an all sky rm catalogue presented by @xcite found that the rm distribution at the largest scales is shifted to negative latitudes , indicative of a stronger magnetic field in the southern hemisphere and hence the possible existence of an antisymmetric halo magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , local distortions such as that of a parker instability loop can not be ruled out . a dipolar halo field",
    "is also suggested by @xcite , who demonstrated that an oppositely directed torus - like halo field above and below the galactic plane and a symmetric disk field provide a reasonable fit to the latitude extension of the canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) rm measurements , but it is unclear if this model can predict rms that are consistent with observations for all ranges of @xmath9 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite found that the halo field might not be anti - symmetric globally since a halo field that reverses across the plane only towards the inner galaxy provides a better fit to the wmap 22ghz all sky polarization map and an all - sky catalogue of @xmath21 1,400 rms of egss .",
    "recently , @xcite used egs rms calculated from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) catalogue , a 1.4ghz continuum survey of the entire sky north of dec=@xmath2340@xmath10 , to derive a vertical field strength of 0.30 @xmath24 0.03 @xmath8 g for @xmath22@xmath250@xmath10 pointing from the south pole towards the north pole and a field strength of 0.14 @xmath24 0.02 @xmath8 g for @xmath22@xmath260@xmath10 pointing from the north towards the south pole .",
    "this new result is incompatible with the simple dipolar field model concluded in earlier studies",
    ".    the current knowledge of the parity of the galactic magnetic field is based on the sparse all - sky rm measurements and their potential unreliable values because they were derived using polarization angles at only a few and sometimes widely separated wavelengths .",
    "moreover , most conclusions were drawn using low - latitude rms which are likely to be contaminated by turbulence and tangled fields in the galactic disk . in this paper",
    ", we present an accurate rotation measure survey of more than 1,000 polarized extragalactic sources previously identified in the nvss catalogue towards both the north and the south galactic poles at a sampling density of approximately 1 source / deg@xmath27 .",

    "to measure the vertical magnetic field at the location of the sun , rms along many sight lines towards the galactic poles are desired . since there is only one pulsar with known rm towards each of the galactic poles ( see   [ subsection : vertical ] ) , one has to rely on rms of egss to measure the high latitude galactic magnetic fields . to avoid the inefficiency of conducting a blind survey",
    ", we applied appropriate filters to the nvss catalogue @xcite to yield a target list consists of highly polarized compact egss near the galactic poles , towards which one can measure rms . in order to determine rms as accurately and precisely as possible , we chose to observe point - like extragalactic sources with a signal to noise ratio in linear polarization of at least 8 . to allow for a reasonable observing time per source , we set our polarized flux threshold at 4 mjy .",
    "a rough estimation shows that a vertical magnetic field of strength 0.2 @xmath8 g and a total column density of thermal electrons towards the galactic poles of @xmath21 25 pc @xmath28 @xcite would produce a rm of magnitude 4 rad m@xmath2 .",
    "since the intrinsic rm dispersion of extragalactic sources is roughly 15 rad m@xmath2 @xcite , one needs approximately 500 sources to detect the predicted rm signal at a decent signal - to - noise level . the polarized flux cutoff at 4 mjy and the need of @xmath21 500 egss requires us to select sources down to a galactic latitude @xmath29@xmath22@xmath29 of 77@xmath10 in the nvss catalogue .",
    "rm of egss towards the north galactic pole were acquired at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) over the period 2006 july 23rd to august 20th using the 9a=96 m array configuration spanning baselines from 96 m to 2760 m ; with 8 20-mhz frequency bands ( each band is composed of 64 channels of width 0.3125 mhz ) centered on each of 1381mhz and 1713mhz .",

    "a source with known polarization , one or both of 3c286 and 3c138 was observed for absolute polarization angle calibration .    the nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) was used for data edition and calibration .",
    "aips is designed to process interferometric data for telescopes with circular feeds while the wsrt consists of orthogonal linear feeds @xcite .",
    "therefore , to properly calibrate and reduce wsrt data in aips requires various non - standard procedures , such as relabeling the stokes parameters .",
    "these calibration steps are described in details in the aips reduction cookbook for wsrt data .",

    "the wham data towards the cap regions are used to search for correlations between em and rm in   [ subsection : nps ] .",
    "traditionally , the rm of an egs is calculated by a linear least square fit of the unwrapped polarization position angle @xmath12 @xmath50 as a function of the square of the wavelength . however , since the polarization angle can wrap around n@xmath38 , there exists multiple rms that provide equally good least square fits to the observed angle versus @xmath14@xmath27 relation .",
    "we have used the faraday rotation measure synthesis , first presented by @xcite and more recently illustrated in @xcite and @xcite , to obtain reliable rms of the observed egss .",
    "this method is equivalent to taking the fourier transform of the complex polarization vector measured at each frequency channel .",

    "this can cause serious problems when attempting to extract the correct rm . to enable accurate extraction of both the rm and the polarized flux , we have deconvolved the complex faraday depth spectrum using the clean algorithm as described by @xcite ( also see the appendix in * ? ? ?",
    "we have adopted a gain factor of 0.1 and we stop cleaning once the residual peak falls below 4 times the noise level in the final spectrum .",
    "the value of rm and the polarized intensity of the egs is calculated by fitting a parabola to the peak(s ) of the deconvolved faraday depth power spectrum .",

    "the atca observation has relatively low sensitivity but small @xmath52 , while the wsrt observation has better sensitivity but larger @xmath52 .",
    "this results in comparable rm errors for both the northern and southern data sets .",
    "we have verified , using several sources with steep/ shallow spectra in our sample , that the spectral index has little effect on the location of the faraday dispersion function peak @xcite .",
    "we therefore choose not to include spectral index effect in our rm computation/ deconvolution procedure .",
    "we have followed the above steps to derive rms of egss towards the north galactic cap using the 20 cm wsrt data . for sight lines towards the south galactic cap ,",
    "rms were first computed using only the 20 cm atca data .",
    "if the source appears to have a well behaved faraday depth spectrum with a single rm component , we then add in the 13 cm atca data to achieve better rm precision .",
    "this step requires the assumption that the same rm component dominates at both 13 and 20 cm . to minimize the potential systematics ( such as calibration errors )",
    "introduced when we calculate the rms using both bands , we have rejected sources that have rm values derived from the 20 cm only data that are at 2@xmath34 level different from those obtained using both bands . we have also discarded sources with polarization detection signal - to - noise ratio below 8 and with polarized fraction greater than 30 @xmath47 .",
    "the least square fit and faraday depth spectra plots of two example egss are shown in fig  [ fig : rmfit ] .",
    "since the frequency setup for the atca observations leaves a larger gap in @xmath54 space than the wsrt observations , it leads to higher side lobe levels seen in the atca faraday depth spectrum . for bright polarized sources ( as the two example egss ) , the least square fit and the rm synthesis method should yield converging results .",
    "as the faraday rotation phenomenon is a line - of - sight effect , the observed rm is the sum of all the rm contributions along a sight line .",
    "this includes the intrinsic rm which originates in the magneto - ionic environment at the radio source ; the rm produced in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) or any intervener(s ) ; that produced by the milky way s large scale and small scale field ; as well as that produced by the ionosphere .",
    "the rm contribution from the igm is negligible  cosmological faraday rotation measure has an estimated upper limit of @xmath21 2 rad m@xmath2 assuming that the cosmological magnetic field and electron density is homogenous @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if these two quantities vary on scales much smaller than the hubble scale , then no cosmological imprint to the all sky rm is expected as it would average out to be zero .    as global positioning system ( gps )",
    "data were not available to monitor the real time ionospheric activity during the observations at the atca and the wsrt , we can only rely on theoretical models to estimate the contribution of ionospheric rm to the observed rms .",
    "we note that theoretical predictions do not take into account of sudden and temporal ionospheric changes .",
    "we have used the international geomagnetic reference field ( igrf ) model @xcite , along with the international reference ionosphere ( iri ) 2007 @xcite to estimate the ionospheric rm during the observations .",
    "it has been found that the ionospheric rm above the atca is negative ( geomagnetic field points away from the center of the earth ) and that above the wsrt is positive ( geomagnetic field points towards the center of the earth ) with a magnitude @xmath42 1 rad m@xmath2 , which is consistent with the estimation reported by @xcite .",
    "the variation of ionospheric rm along a certain ra and dec over the course of the observation is also @xmath42 1 rad m@xmath2 .",
    "this can be verified by computing the rm of a bright polarized egs as a function of time over the observing run .",
    "we find that the rm stays constant as a function of time within its error . to account for the rm uncertainties introduced by faraday rotation from the ionosphere ,",
    "we have added a systematic error of 1 rad m@xmath2 in quadrature to the rm measurement error for all sources .",
    "the rm derivation procedures described in the previous section produced 472 reliable rms towards the north galactic pole ( 94 % of the total number of observed sources ) and 341 ( 72 % of the total number of observed sources ) towards the south .",
    "the source coordinates , rms , rm uncertainties , and their flux information are listed in table  [ table : northrms ] and  [ table : southrms ] for sources towards the north and the south cap respectively . to help visualizing the distribution of rms towards the galactic caps , we present the histograms of the unfiltered rms in fig  [ fig : histo ] .",

    ", we will address how outliers and anomalous rm regions were identified .",
    "we do so to ensure that the rms towards the galactic caps are representative of the large scale milky way foreground with minimal contributions from elsewhere along the sight line .",
    "we have visually inspected multi - wavelength images towards the galactic caps to look for possible features seen at other wavelengths that might be associated with rm structures . in particular , we have examined the following maps : the hi neutral hydrogen map @xcite ; the dust map @xcite ; the rosat all sky survey x - ray map @xcite ; the 408 mhz total synchrotron intensity map @xcite ; the 1.4 ghz polarized synchrotron emission map ( north : @xcite , south : @xcite ) , and the h@xmath35 all sky composite map @xcite .",
    "we note that the coma cluster ( the brightest x - ray feature in the rosat all sky x - ray image towards the north galactic cap ) is located only 2@xmath10 away from the galactic pole . according to @xcite",

    "the linear correlation coefficient between rm and @xmath55 is @xmath21 0.04 towards the north galactic cap and @xmath21 0.03 towards the south galactic cap hence there is little support for correlations between em and rm towards the galactic poles .",
    "it is not surprising , however , to find rm and em uncorrelated .",
    "as em is proportional to the electron density squared , it is more sensitive to high density regions ; while rm is proportional to just the electron density , thus it has more contributions from diffuse low density regions that occupy greater line - of - sight path lengths .",
    "magnetic field reversals along the line of sight can also remove any possible correlations between rm and em .",
    "all these effects work towards decoupling the measured rm and em along a particular sight line .",
    "besides excluding features at other wavelengths that might contribute to the observed rms , one also has to remove sources in the sample with high intrinsic rms .",
    "typical radio galaxies at a few ghz are generally dominated by their bright radio lobes which are thought to have small intrinsic faraday rotation measures ( see for example , * ? ? ?",

    "a classical mean - field dynamo favors even field symmetry ( a quadrupolar field ) , in which the toroidal component is symmetric across the mid - plane while the vertical component reverses direction @xcite . for a weakly differentially rotating galaxy , or a halo , odd field symmetry ( a dipolar field )",
    "is preferred , in which the toroidal component reverses direction across mid - plane while the vertical component does not @xcite . however , numerical simulations carried out by @xcite found comparable growth rates of the odd and the even symmetry modes , suggesting that the present galactic magnetic field might be of mixed parity rather than of pure even or odd parity .",
    "as mentioned in   [ section : introduction ] , studies of the milky way s field parity have yielded diverging results , possibly because they focus on different galactic latitude ranges and because it is difficult to distinguish local magneto - ionic effects from a genuine large scale field .",
    "the most convincing piece of work is the wavelet analysis of all sky rms conducted by @xcite .",
    "they found that the local magnetic field has an even parity  the horizontal field component does not reverse direction across the galactic plane . if the milky way s large scale field is indeed quadrupolar in nature , then one expects the vertical magnetic field to reverse direction across the mid - plane . on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite concluded from an all sky smoothed rm map that the rm distribution towards the inner galaxy is anti - symmetric across the galactic plane .",
    "the authors attribute this to a large scale dipolar field .",
    "if this is the case , then one expects the vertical magnetic field to have the same direction above and below the galactic plane . in   [ subsection : vertical ] , we found that the vertical field is consistent with zero for @xmath22@xmath26 + 77@xmath10 and that @xmath72 = @xmath300.31 @xmath24 0.03 @xmath8 g for @xmath22@xmath25 - 77@xmath10 .",
    "this is inconsistent with either a quadrupole or a dipole large scale field configuration . even though a simple disk dynamo can produce a vertical field strength comparable to that being observed towards the south cap",
    ", it can not explain the observed vertical field geometry .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the mean field dynamo can operate in the halo of a rotating galaxy since the mean helicity ( the @xmath35-effect ) of gaseous halos are non - zero due to galactic fountains / parker instabilities .",
    "the dominant mode is an axisymmetric field with odd parity with respect to the galactic disk ; this is of the opposite parity from the mode excited by the dynamo action in the galactic disk . the asymmetric rm pattern that we see towards the north / south galactic hemisphere seems to support this idea . in particular , the shift of rm structure on the largest scales to @xmath22=@xmath2315@xmath10 found by @xcite can be explained by a dipolar field in the halo of the galaxy such that the vertical magnetic field from the disk and the halo add up in the southern hemisphere .",
    "@xcite were able to obtain a reasonable fit to the latitude extension of cgps measurements using an asymmetric halo field plus a symmetric disk field .",
    "more recently , @xcite found that mid - latitude nvss rms can be well fitted with a @xmath21 0.4 @xmath8 g toroidal halo field that reverses direction across the mid - plane . if indeed an anti - symmetric halo field and a symmetric disk field co - exist in the milky way , then on the side of the galactic disk ( in this case @xmath22@xmath260@xmath10 ) , the vertical component of the halo field and that of the disk field would partly cancel out , as they are oppositely directed .",
    "these two vertical components would add up on the other side of the disk ( @xmath22@xmath250@xmath10 ) .",
    "depending on the relative vertical field strength between the halo / disk field and their extension above / below the disk , it is not impossible that they can cancel each other out exactly towards the northern hemisphere resulting in a net rm that is consistent with zero .",
    "however , this theory has been challenged by numerical work .",
    "@xcite showed that the halo dynamo requires more than a hubble time to reach the steady state configuration and thus the field that one observes at this moment might merely be a transient field of mixed parity .",
    "@xcite solved the mean field dynamo equations for a system with a disk and a halo dynamo .",
    "these authors were not able to produce any co - existing system of a dipole - like halo field and a quadrupole - like disk field ; instead , one always dominates over the other , though @xcite acknowledged that using a larger turbulence diffusivity ratio between the halo and the disk might mitigate the problem .",
    "we conclude that the observed vertical magnetic field geometry towards the galactic poles is not consistent with predictions from a pure disk dynamo .",
    "a separate halo dynamo of odd parity could potentially account for the observed vertical magnetic fields at high latitude but until now no numerical simulation has successfully produced a co - existing disk and halo fields of opposite parity in a steady state .",
    "the competing theory to the dynamo origin of galactic magnetic fields is that of primordial origin . the primordial field theory suggests the following :",
    "if the igm field is frozen into the gas , then the total magnetic field would be enhanced by a few orders of magnitude as gas clouds collapse to form a protogalaxy .",
    "this relic field would then be modified by the differential rotation of the galaxy , producing the present day galactic magnetic fields ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the component of the seed field parallel to the galactic disk can be removed diffusively and through large scale flow , but the component of the magnetic field parallel to the rotation axis of the galaxy is trapped @xcite .",
    "since galactic rotation is symmetric with respect to the plane , one expects the azimuthal component of such a field to reverse its direction across the mid - plane while the vertical component preserves its direction , thus resulting in a dipolar type field @xcite .",
    "the strength of a vertical galactic magnetic field of primordial origin depends highly on the initial orientation of the intergalactic seed field with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "the collapsed gas that forms the proto - galaxy could potentially increase its strength by two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this small field is preserved until the present day since the total vertical magnetic flux is conserved .",
    "the concept of a primordial field may be overly simplistic because galactic disks probably build up over time through mergers and infall .",
    "the addition of new material can add new magnetic flux , but whatever flux is added is subject to the constraints described above .",
    "the observed vertical field geometry is not consistent with that from a pure dipole field of primordial origin : the vertical field from the south galactic pole is directed toward us , while the vertical field toward the north galactic pole is consistent with zero .",
    "therefore , we can not attribute the observed vertical magnetic field to a primordial field alone .",
    "in   [ subsection : rmsf ] , we have shown that the rm sfs are flat , implying that no specific scale is associated with the observed rm pattern towards the north and the south galactic caps . in this section",
    ", we will place limits on turbulence properties at high @xmath56 as well as estimate the random magnetic field strength using a plane - parallel free electron density model .",
    "if we assume that the observed rm of an egs is the sum of only its intrinsic rm and the rm produced by the magneto - ionic medium in the milky way , then the observed structure function is the superposition of the intrinsic rm structure function and that of the foreground .",
    "the sf of intrinsic rms of egss is expected to be flat , because intrinsic rm of independent egss are uncorrelated with each other , at a saturation level of 2@xmath103 . on the other hand ,",
    "a turbulent galactic foreground with an outer scale @xmath104 and and an inner scale @xmath105 would produce a sf that rises between @xmath106 and @xmath107 and saturates beyond @xmath104 at 2@xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the variance of rm due to random magnetic fields or variations in electron density in the foreground ism .",
    "fig  [ fig : rmsf ] shows that the observed rm structure function towards both galactic caps saturates at roughly 170 rad@xmath27 m@xmath68 , which corresponds to @xmath110 @xmath21 9 rad m@xmath2 .",
    "this is then also the upper limit of @xmath109 .",
    "the flatness of the observe rm sfs suggests that intrinsic rm of egss dominate the sf , although one can not rule out the possibility that the outer scale of turbulence in the galactic ism is below the smallest angular scale probed .",
    "this result is consistent with previous turbulence studies towards the north galactic pole carried out by @xcite and @xcite who both found flat rm structure functions on scales greater than 1@xmath10 - 2@xmath10 and concluded that the intrinsic egs rm dominates the sf .",
    "however , they have reported a saturation level at log(sf@xmath111 ) @xmath21 2.8 which implies a larger total rm standard deviation ( @xmath21 16 rad m@xmath2 ) than what we have measured .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to the different methods used to handle the rm measurement errors in computing the sf .",
    "it is unclear if the sf of rm measurement errors was subtracted from the measured sf in these previous works .",
    "also , rm outliers in the sample and inaccurate rms can lead to offsets in the sf .",
    "we note that the sfs computed by @xcite and by @xcite were all based on a relatively small number of egss ( 52 sources at @xmath22 @xmath26 + 60@xmath10 in @xcite and 35 sources at @xmath22 @xmath26 + 70@xmath10 in @xcite ) , sparsely sampled towards a large region near the pole .",
    "next , we use the coherent vertical magnetic field strength derived in   [ subsection : vertical ] and properties of turbulence in the galactic halo to estimate the random magnetic field strength at high galactic latitude .",
    "we construct a cell model similar to those used to estimate the random field in the inner galaxy @xcite , the large magellanic cloud @xcite and the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",
