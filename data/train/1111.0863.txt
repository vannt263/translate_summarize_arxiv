    "weak interaction experiments with neutrino energies around 1 gev are quite sensitive to the neutrino oscillation parameters and as a consequence many experiments like miniboone , sciboone , k2k , t2k , no@xmath2a , etc .",
    "explore this energy range .",
    "although many interesting results can be obtained without a detailed knowledge of the various processes used for the neutrino detection or the neutrino flux , a reliable estimate of the @xmath3n cross section for various processes is mandatory to carry out a precise analysis of the measurements .    among these processes ,",
    "strangeness conserving ( @xmath4 ) weak interactions involving quasielastic production of leptons induced by charged as well as neutral weak currents have been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "much work has also been done to understand one pion production in the weak sector  @xcite .",
    "there are other inelastic reactions like hyperon and kaon production ( @xmath5 ) that could also be measured even at quite low energies . however ,",
    "very few calculations study these processes  @xcite .",
    "this is partly justified by their small cross sections due to the cabibbo suppression . as a result of this situation ,",
    "the monte carlo generators used in the analysis of the current experiments apply models that are not well suited to describe the strangeness production at low energies .",
    "neut , for example , used by super - kamiokande , k2k , sciboone and t2k , only considers associated production of kaons within a model based on the excitation and later decay of baryonic resonances and from deep inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "similarly , other neutrino event generators like neugen  @xcite , nuance  @xcite ( see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and genie  @xcite do not consider single hyperon / kaon production .",
    "recently we have studied single kaon production induced by neutrinos at low and intermediate energies  @xcite using chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6pt ) .",
    "we found that up to e@xmath7 gev , single kaon production dominates over the associated production of kaons along with hyperons which is mainly due to its lower threshold energy .",
    "in this work , we extend our model to include weak single antikaon production off nucleons .",
    "the theoretical model is necessarily more complicated than for kaons because resonant mechanisms , absent for the kaon case , could be relevant .",
    "on the other hand , the threshold for associated antikaon production corresponds to the @xmath8 channel and it is much higher than for the kaon case ( ky ) .",
    "this implies that the process we study is the dominant source of antikaons for a wide range of energies",
    ".    the study may be useful in the analysis of antineutrino experiments at miner@xmath2a , no@xmath2a , t2k and others .",

    "in fact , the lowest energy antikaon associate production , ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) , has a quite high threshold ( @xmath102 gev ) and thus , it leads to even smaller cross sections in the range of energies we have explored .",
