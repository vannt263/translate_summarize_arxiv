    "the _ finite volume method _ ( fvm ) attracted a lot of attentions during the past several decades , we refer to @xcite and the references cited therein for an incomplete list of references . due to the local conservation of numerical fluxes , the capability to deal with the problems on the domains with complex geometries , and other advantages",
    ", fvm has a wide range of applications in scientific and engineering computations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there have been many studies of the mathematical theory for fvm , see , e.g. , @xcite and the monographs @xcite .",
    "however , much attention has been paid to linear fvm schemes(see e.g. , @xcite ) , high order fvm schemes have not been investigated as much or as satisfactorily as linear fvm schemes .",
    "moreover , the analysis of high order fvm schemes are often done case by case . for instances ,",
    "earlier works on quadratic fvm schemes can be traced back to @xcite , high order fvms for 1d elliptic equations were derived in @xcite , and high order fvms on rectangular meshes were derived and analyzed in @xcite , the quadratic fvm schemes on triangular meshes have also been intensively studied by @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , no analysis of fvm scheme of an arbitrary order has been published yet .    in this paper , we study a family of any order fvm schemes in the one - dimensional setting . instead of a case - by - case study as in the literature for quadratic and cubic fvm schemes ,",
    "we adopt a unified approach to establish the inf - sup condition .",
    "earlier works(see , e.g. @xcite ) utilized element - wise analysis to prove that the bilinear form resulting from fvm is positive definite , which is a stronger property than the inf - sup condition .",
    "hence , some assumption is needed for the mesh , such as quasi - uniformity and shape - regularity ( in 2d ) .",
    "the major difference here is that we prove only the inf - sup condition ( instead of positive definiteness of the bilinear form ) and there is no mesh condition attached . with help of the inf - sup condition ,",
    "we obtain the optimal rate of convergence in both the @xmath3 and @xmath0 norms .    in this paper",
    ", we also study the superconvergence property of our fvm schemes . note that while the superconvergence theory of _ finite element methods _ ( fem )",
    "has reached its maturity ( @xcite ) , the superconvergence analysis of fvm has also been focused on the linear schemes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper , it is shown that for a 1d general elliptic equation , the superconvergence behavior of fvm is similar to that of the counterpart finite element method . for instances ,",
    "the convergence rate at nodal points is @xmath1 , the rate at interior lobatto points ( defined in section 4 ) is @xmath4 , the convergence rate of the derivative error at gauss points is @xmath5 . while in some special cases , some surprising superconvergence results have been found and proved .",
    "that is , the convergence rate of the derivative error at all gauss points can reach @xmath4 or @xmath1 , depending on the coefficient of the elliptic equations . the derivative convergence rate @xmath1 doubles the global optimal rate @xmath6 , which is much better than the counterpart finite element method s @xmath5 rate ; the derivative convergence rate @xmath4 is one order higher than the counterpart finite element method s @xmath5 .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows . in section 2",
    "we present an arbitrary order fvm scheme for elliptic equations in one - dimensional setting .",
    "in particular , we use the gauss points of order @xmath7 to construct the control volumes and choose the trial space as the lagrange finite element of @xmath2th order with the interpolation points being the lobatto points of order @xmath2 . in section 3",
    "we provide a unified proof for the inf - sup condition and establish the optimal convergence rate both under @xmath3 and @xmath0 norms . in section 4 ,",
    "we study the superconvergence property at some special points of our fvm schemes of any order . in section 5 , a post - processing technique based on superconvergence results in the section 4",
    "is proposed to recover the derivative of the solution .",
