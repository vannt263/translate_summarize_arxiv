    "in the dirty boson problem , the combined effect of disorder and two - particle interaction yields an intriguing interplay between localization and superfluidity @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the dirty boson problem was first studied with superfluid helium in porous media like aerosol glasses ( vycor ) , where the pores are modeled by statistically distributed local scatterers @xcite . in bose gases disorder appears either naturally as , e.g. , in magnetic wire traps @xcite , where imperfections of the wire itself can induce local disorder , or it may be created artificially and controllably as , e.g. , by using laser speckle fields @xcite . a set - up more in the spirit of condensed matter physics relies on a bose gas with impurity atoms of another species trapped in a deep optical lattice , so the latter represent randomly distributed scatterers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an incommensurate optical lattice can provide a pseudo - random potential for an ultracold bose gas @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the dirty boson problem can be treated , in principle , via two complementary approaches .",
    "the first one applies the bogoliubov theory @xcite and treats disorder , quantum , and thermal fluctuations perturbatively , which is only valid in systems with sufficiently small random potential and interaction strength at low enough temperatures @xcite . with this",
    "it was found that a weak random disorder potential leads to a depletion of both the condensate and the superfluid density due to the localization of bosons in the respective minima of the random potential .",
    "this seminal huang - meng theory was later on extended in different research directions .",
    "results for the shift of the velocity of sound as well as for its damping due to collisions with the external field are worked out in ref .",
    "furthermore , the original special case of a delta - correlated random potential was generalized to experimentally more realistic disorder correlations with a finite correlation length , which model , for instance , the pore size dependence of vycor glass .",
    "a gaussian correlation was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas laser speckles are treated in refs .",
    "also the disorder - induced shift of the critical temperature for the homogeneous case was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which also has implications for a harmonic confinement @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that dirty dipolar bose gases yield even at zero temperature characteristic directional dependences for thermodynamic quantities due to the anisotropy emerging of superfluidity .",
    "the recent perturbative work @xcite studies even in detail the impact of the external random potential upon the quantum fluctuations .",
    "despite all these many theoretical predictions of the huang - meng theory , which also affect the collective excitations frequencies of harmonically trapped dirty bosons @xcite , so far no experiment has tested them quantitatively .    on the other hand ,",
    "the dirty boson problem was also tackled non - perturbatively in different ways .",
    "a major result is that increase in the disorder strength at zero temperature yields a first - order quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a bose - glass phase , where in the latter all particles reside in the respective minima of the random potential .",
    "this prediction is achieved for three dimensions by solving the underlying gross - pitaevskii equation with a random phase approximation @xcite , as well as by a stochastic self - consistent mean - field approach using two chemical potentials , one for the condensate and one for the excited particles @xcite .",
    "dual to that , the non - perturbative approach of refs .",
    "@xcite investigates energetically shape and size of the local minicondensates in the disorder landscape and deduces from that , for a decreasing disorder strength , when the bose - glass phase becomes unstable and goes over into the superfluid . at finite temperatures the location of superfluid , bose - glass , and normal phase in the phase diagram",
    "was qualitatively analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a hartree - fock mean - field theory with the replica method .",
    "also monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations have been applied to study the dirty boson problem .",
    "diffusion mc in ref .",
    "@xcite obtained the surprising result that a strong enough disorder yields a superfluid density larger than the condensate density .",
    "furthermore , worm algorithm mc @xcite was able to determine the dynamic critical exponent of the quantum phase transition from the bose - glass to the superfluid in two dimensions .",
    "all those previous theoretical investigations mainly focus on the possible emergence of the bose - glass phase and its elusive properties for homogeneous dirty bosons .",
    "experimentally , however , ultracold quantum gases have to be confined with the help of a harmonic trapping potential .",
    "therefore , in case of trapped dirty bosons , there is a lack of knowledge concerning the bose - glass region , where the bosons within the harmonic trap localize in the respective minima of the superimposed random potential .",
    "the present paper works out in detail a theoretical approach how to describe this localization of bosons within a harmonic confinement in a systematic way . to this end",
    "we extend the hartree - fock mean - field theory of ref .",
    "@xcite for a three - dimensional weakly interacting homogeneous bose gas in a delta - correlated disorder potential to the experimentally relevant trapping confinement via a semi - classical approximation and to a general number of spatial dimensions . by doing so ,",
    "we work out , in particular , all the respective technical details which were omitted for brevity in ref .  @xcite . in the following",
    "we start in section ii with introducing the functional integral representation of the partition function for a trapped weakly interacting bose gas in a disorder potential at finite temperature . applying the replica method in section iii",
    "allows to eliminate the random potential right away at the expense of introducing disorder - induced interactions between different replica fields , which are nonlocal in both space and time .",
    "then we work out a hartree - fock mean - field theory for this model in section iv . after specializing to replica symmetry in section v ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a delta - correlated disorder potential and contact interaction potential for the dirty boson model in section vi .",
    "the underlying free energy is obtained in section vii . from it",
    "we determine via extremization the underlying self - consistency equations for the three components of the particle density , namely the condensate density , the thermal density , and the density of fragmented local bose - einstein condensates within the respective minima of the random potential landscape .",
    "the case of three dimensions is treated in section viii , whereas one spatial dimension is dealt with in section ix .",
    "note that the two - dimensional case is not treated in this paper , since our mean - field theory turns out to diverge in two dimensions , so both a regularization and a subsequent renormalization is needed , which goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the statistical description of a disorder potential , which is central for describing the dirty boson problem , as well as the disorder ensemble average in appendix a. finally , appendix b defines the order parameters for the superfluid and the bose - glass phase via off - diagonal long - range order of corresponding correlation functions .",
    "we start by considering the model of an @xmath0-dimensional bose gas in an arbitrary trap @xmath1 and a general interaction potential @xmath2 at finite temperature @xmath3 in @xmath0 spatial dimensions .",
    "the starting point is the functional integral for the grand - canonical partition function    @xmath4/\\hslash},\\label{eq : z}\\ ] ]    where the integration is performed over all bose fields @xmath5 which are periodic in imaginary time @xmath6 , i.e.,@xmath7 .",

    "furthermore , @xmath12 denotes a generally correlated disorder landscape , whose statistical properties are explained in detail in appendix a.    note that , in order to guarantee the normal ordering within the functional integral , we should work with adjoint fields @xmath13 with a shifted imaginary time @xmath14 with @xmath15 which is infinitesimally later than the imaginary time @xmath6 of the fields @xmath16 .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity , we mainly use in the following the notation @xmath17 and emphasize the normal ordering only when it is indispensable .",
    "a standard method to deal with disorder problems is the replica method @xcite . instead of treating the actual problem ,",
    "one looks at @xmath18 copies of the system , then analytically continues the replicated system to the limit @xmath19 . as the concrete realization of the disorder potential @xmath12",
    "is not known , the free energy of the system @xmath20 is defined as the free energy for fixed disorder potential averaged over all its realizations @xmath21 where @xmath22 corresponds to the disorder average over many realizations . in general it is not possible to explicitly evaluate expression ( [ f ] ) , as @xmath23 the replica method is provided by investigating the @xmath24 power of the grand - canonical partition function @xmath25 in the limit @xmath26 , which yields for the replicated partition function @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we deduce for the free energy ( [ f ] )    @xmath28    the fact that all @xmath18 replicas are identical simplifies the calculation further as we will show below . the @xmath18-fold replication of the partition function of the disordered bose gas in eq . and a subsequent averaging with respect to the disorder potential @xmath12 results in : @xmath29\\psi_{\\alpha}({\\bf x},\\tau)\\right.\\right.\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\left.+\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{x}'\\psi_{\\alpha}^{\\ast}\\left(\\mathbf{x},\\tau\\right)\\psi_{\\alpha}\\left(\\mathbf{x},\\tau\\right)v^{({\\rm int})}({\\bf x - x'})\\psi_{\\alpha}^{\\ast}\\left(\\mathbf{x'},\\tau\\right)\\psi_{\\alpha}\\left(\\mathbf{x'},\\tau\\right)\\right\\ } \\bigg\\}\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\times\\overline{\\exp\\left\\ { \\int d\\mathbf{x}\\,\\frac{-1}{\\hbar}\\int_{0}^{\\hbar\\beta}d\\tau\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{\\mathcal{n}}\\psi_{\\alpha}^{*}({\\bf x},\\tau)\\psi_{\\alpha}({\\bf x},\\tau)u({\\bf x})\\right\\ } } \\,,\\label{zp26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the replica fields with the replica index @xmath32 .",
    "the remaining disorder ensemble average of the exponential function can be performed exactly on a formal level explained in appendix a. indeed , comparing expressions ( [ zp26 ] ) and ( [ zp10 ] ) shows that averaging with respect to the disorder potential @xmath12 corresponds to the generating functional ( [ zp12 ] ) with the auxiliary current field : @xmath33 therefore , the disordered bose gas is described by the disorder averaged , replicated grand - canonical partition function @xmath34/\\hbar},\\label{zp24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the following replica action @xmath35 & = & \\int_{0}^{\\hbar\\beta}d\\tau\\int d\\mathbf{x}\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{\\mathcal{n}}\\,\\left\\ { \\psi_{\\alpha}^{*}({\\bf x},\\tau)\\left[\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau}-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}{\\bf \\delta}+v({\\bf x})-\\mu\\right]\\psi_{\\alpha}({\\bf x},\\tau)\\right.\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\left.+\\frac{1}{2}\\int d\\mathbf{x}'\\psi_{\\alpha}^{\\ast}\\left(\\mathbf{x},\\tau\\right)\\psi_{\\alpha}\\left(\\mathbf{x},\\tau\\right)v^{({\\rm int})}({\\bf x - x'})\\psi_{\\alpha}^{\\ast}\\left(\\mathbf{x'},\\tau\\right)\\psi_{\\alpha}\\left(\\mathbf{x'},\\tau\\right)\\right\\ } \\nonumber \\\\   &   & + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{i!}\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\hbar}\\right)^{i-1}\\int_{0}^{\\hbar\\beta}d\\tau_{1}\\cdots\\int_{0}^{\\hbar\\beta}d\\tau_{i}\\int d\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\cdots\\int d\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\nonumber \\\\   &   & \\times\\sum_{\\alpha_{1}=1}^{\\mathcal{n}}\\cdots\\sum_{\\alpha_{i}=1}^{\\mathcal{n}}d^{\\left(i\\right)}(\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{x}_{i})\\left|\\psi_{\\alpha_{1}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\tau_{1}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\cdots\\left|\\psi_{\\alpha_{i}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i},\\tau_{i}\\right)\\right|^{2},\\label{zp29}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denote the respective cumulants of the disorder potential , see appendix a. for any experimental realistic disorder potential the dominant cumulant is of second order , as we assume , without loss of generality , that the first cumulant vanishes according to .",

    "now we apply standard methods for developing a self - consistent mean - field approximation @xcite in order to derive hartree - fock mean - field equations for the bose gas in a random potential . to this end",
