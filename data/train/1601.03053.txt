    "performing stellar archeology on white dwarfs , by far the most common stellar remnant , provides valuable information for not only understanding stellar evolution and mass loss but also galactic evolution .",
    "one of the fundamental relations in the analysis of white dwarfs is the initial - final mass relation ( hereafter ifmr ) , where the masses of white dwarfs are compared directly to the zero - age main sequence mass of their progenitors .",
    "this semi - empirical relation is critical to our understanding of integrated mass - loss over the lifetime of a star and how it changes with stellar mass .",
    "the ifmr has a variety of additional applications including predicting type ia supernovae rates ( pritchet et  al .",
    "2008 ; greggio 2010 ) and overall stellar feedback in galaxy models ( agertz & kravtsov 2014 ) , interpreting the white dwarf luminosity function ( cataln et  al .",
    "2008 ) , and providing a technique for measuring the age of the galactic halo ( kalirai 2013 ) .",
    "analysis of the ifmr began with weidemann ( 1977 ) , where it was shown that the models of the time greatly underestimated the observed stellar mass loss .",
    "subsequent work on the ifmr by a number of groups ( see weidemann 2000 for review ) resulted in a broad but sparsely populated relation that showed a clear trend with higher - mass main sequence stars producing increasingly more massive white dwarfs . in the past 15 years",
    "the amount of ifmr data has greatly increased ( e.g. , claver et  al .",

    "2009 ; williams et  al .  2009 ; dobbie & baxter 2010 ; dobbie et  al .  2012 ) .",
    "these newer data retain the general trend of the previous ifmr work , but the scatter in the data remains significant .",
    "the source of this scatter may be attributable to several factors including the possible stochastic nature of mass loss , effects from variation in metallicity or environment , or systematic differences between the studies .",
    "one important systematic is the challenge in defining the ages of the clusters these white dwarfs belong to , which creates uncertainty in the derived lifetimes of their progenitor stars .",
    "cummings et  al .",
    "( 2015 ; hereafter paper i ) began to analyze the important intermediate - mass ifmr ( progenitor masses of 3 - 4 m@xmath1 ) from the rich ngc 2099 ( m37 ) .",
    "this work strengthened the observational evidence that in this mass range the ifmr is steep , where the final white dwarf mass increases more rapidly with increasing progenitor mass .",
    "comparison to the rich population of comparable mass white dwarfs in both the hyades and praesepe from kalirai et  al .",
    "( 2014 ) showed strongly consistent ifmrs .",
    "this consistency also suggests that across this mass range the slightly metal - rich progenitor stars from the hyades and praesepe ( [ fe / h]@xmath00.15 ) have no significant increase in mass - loss rates compared to those in the solar metallicity ngc 2099 .    expanding beyond paper i",
    ", we now look at the challenging higher - mass region ( m@xmath4 of 46.5 m@xmath1 ) of the ifmr by focusing on white dwarfs in younger clusters .",
    "while younger clusters do not provide a broad mass range of white dwarfs , they provide several important advantages . first , the highest - mass white dwarfs are the most compact and lowest luminosity , and because they form first they remain bright only in the youngest clusters ( @xmath5 200 myr ) .",
    "second , the cooling rates are far more rapid in young and hot white dwarfs and , as a result , errors in temperature lead to far smaller errors in both cooling age and luminosity . third , high - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath20.9 m@xmath1 ) may be prone to be ejected from their parent population clusters , either due to dynamical interactions or potential velocity kicks due to asymmetric mass loss during their formation ( fellhauer et  al .  2003 ;",
    "tremblay et  al .",
    "therefore , the probability of finding high - mass white dwarfs still within their cluster population may decrease with age .",
    "these three reasons are why younger clusters provide far more advantages in analyzing high - mass white dwarfs with the best precision .    in this paper",
    "we begin our analysis with the rich , young , and nearby cluster ngc 2323 ( m50 ) .",
    "based on population analysis , kalirai et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) find that it is approximately three times as rich as the pleiades , making it an excellent environment to search for the rare remnants of higher - mass stars .",
    "additionally , to expand our sample we self - consistently reanalyze publicly available data on all published high - mass white dwarfs from clusters ( pleiades [ m45 ] , ngc 2516 , ngc 2287 , ngc 3532 , and ngc 2168 [ m35 ] ) and sirius b. to further limit systematics , we also self - consistently analyze the cluster parameters for all of the parent cluster populations based on published high - quality ubv photometry .",
    "to look at the broader picture , we connect these high - mass data to the moderate - mass data from paper i and further analyze the broader characteristics of the ifmr .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows , in section 2 we discuss the spectroscopic white dwarf observations of ngc 2323 , the publicly available data we have used , and our reduction and analysis techniques . in section 3",
    "we discuss the ubv photometry based cluster parameters for our six open clusters being analyzed . in section 4",
    "we discuss the cluster membership of our white dwarf candidates in ngc 2323 . in section 5",
    "we discuss the high - mass ifmr and compare to the intermediate - mass ( 34 m@xmath1 progenitors ) ifmr from paper i. in section 6 we summarize our study .",
    "based on the deep bv photometric observations of ngc 2323 ( kalirai et  al .",
    "2003 ) with the canada - france - hawaii telescope and the cfh12k mosaic camera , a sample of white dwarf candidates in ngc 2323 were spectroscopically observed at keck i using the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( lris ; oke et  al .",
    "1995 ) . in total , 10 of these candidates had sufficient signal to properly analyze their characteristics .",
    "the 400/3400 grism was used with 1 \" slits giving a spectral resolution of @xmath06  , which provides us the wavelength coverage of @xmath03000 to 5750  and a series of 5 balmer lines ( h@xmath6 , h@xmath7 , h@xmath8 , h@xmath9 , and h8 ) .",

    "were observed each night .",
    "three independent lris masks were used in 2008 to observe white dwarfs candidates from ngc 2323 .",
    "mask 1 was observed for 40 minutes , mask 2 was observed for 40 minutes , and mask 3 was observed for 2 hours and 40 minutes . in 2011 , individual longslit observations were performed for five different white dwarf candidates in ngc 2323 ranging from 20 minutes to 1 hour and 50 minutes .",
    "lastly , in 2015 an additional 70 minutes was acquired on wd11 , which is a white dwarf candidate of interest that only had 20 minutes of observation in 2011 .",
    "we have reduced and flux calibrated our lris observations using the idl based xidl pipeline .",
    "of our total observed sample of 10 white dwarfs candidates , eight are da white dwarfs and wd23 and wd38 have no clear spectral features .    to provide additional high - mass white dwarfs for comparison we have taken from the vlt archive the observations of seven white dwarf members of ngc 3532 , three white dwarf members of ngc 2287 , and four white dwarf members of ngc 2516 ( based on observations made with eso telescopes under program ids : 079.d-0490(a ) ; 080.d-0654(a ) ; 084.d-1097(a ) ; pi : dobbie ) .",

    "( 2009 ) .",
    "we have performed our own reductions and analyses of these data from both the vlt and keck , but we do not redetermine their membership status in this paper .",
    "the vlt data were reduced using the standard iraf techniques for reduction of longslit data , while the keck data were reduced using the same xidl pipeline used to analyze our ngc 2323 data . as a test for our vlt data reduction , we were provided with the published spectrum of white dwarf j0646 - 203 ( ngc 2287 - 4 ) ( p.d .",

    "this is consistent with the systematic effects of differing core composition , which grow as white dwarfs cool further . ]",
    "a discussion of our adopted models is warranted .",
    "first , we do not adopt the more recent white dwarf atmospheric models of tremblay et  al .",
    "( 2013 ) because those focus only on 3d modeling of convective atmospheres ( @xmath2914,000 k ) , and our current analysis looks hot fully radiative white dwarfs . for our cooling models , while the fontaine et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) models are widely used , we should acknowledge two limitations they have .",
    "first , they assume a 50/50 carbon and oxygen core composition , which based on full stellar evolutionary models is not accurate ( e.g. , romero et  al .",
    "the effect of this on the calculated cooling ages can be important , but for the relatively young white dwarfs we are analyzing this effect remains small .",
    "second , these cooling models do not begin at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( hereafter agb ) and instead begin at a t@xmath10 of @xmath060,000 k. in comparison , the widely used wood ( 1995 ) co cooling models do begin at the tip of the agb and they do not adopt a simple 50/50 carbon and oxygen core composition . unfortunately , their co core models have an upper mass limit of 1.0 m@xmath1 , which limits their application in our analysis but they provide an important test for systematics . in figure 1",
    "we compare the cooling ages from the fontaine et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) co core models at 1.0 m@xmath1 to both the co and pure - carbon core models of wood ( 1995 ) and the basti co models from salaris et  al .",
    "the basti co cooling models adopted c / o ratio profiles based on the basti scaled solar stellar evolution models . the lower panel of figure 1 shows that at high t@xmath30@xmath2845,000 k all of the differences between these models never result in cooling age differences of more than 1.5 myr .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 similarly shows that at cooler temperatures 30,000@xmath5t@xmath10@xmath540,000 k the co models , irrespective of their adopted c / o ratios or starting points , all give strong agreement in cooling ages , but the systematic effects introduced from pure carbon core models ( @xmath010 myr ) are now clearly seen .    for ultramassive white dwarfs ,",
    "the mass at which they transition to one white dwarfs remains uncertain , and it also likely depends on metallicity ( doherty et  al .",
    "here we have adopted a somewhat conservative 1.10 m@xmath1 , but we note that the models of garcia - berro et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue that it may be as low as 1.05 m@xmath1 .",
    "reassuringly , in this mass range the co and one cooling ages at constant mass are consistent for such young white dwarfs , but for these white dwarfs the dependence of the mass - radius relationship on core - composition is very important .",
    "for example , applying the gravities of white dwarfs in the mass range of 1.05 to 1.10 m@xmath1 ( based on co - core models ) to the one models derives masses @xmath00.05 m@xmath1 lower and places them all below 1.05 m@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to adopt 1.10 m@xmath1 as the transition mass .        in table 1",
    "we present our white dwarf parameters for the eight da white dwarfs from ngc 2323 . for clarity in table 1",
    "we have distinguished between members and nonmembers , where membership is based on our comparisons of model based and observed photometry in addition to comparisons of cooling ages to the cluster age ( see our detailed discussion of membership in section 4 ) .",
    "additionally , we have considered s / n ( per resolution element ) and the resulting errors given in table 1 .",
    "the wd22 and wd30 spectra have low s / n and mass errors greater than 0.1 m@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , their parameters are presented for reference but have been cut from our final analysis .",
    "this is because their membership determinations are unreliable , but their low masses do suggest they are field white dwarfs .",
    "with ifmr analysis , the parameters of the star clusters are as critical as the white dwarfs themselves .",
    "this is particularly true for the highest - mass white dwarfs , where the derived masses of their progenitors change rapidly with evolutionary time .",
    "uniform photometric data sets are not available for these six clusters . but in paper i we showed that for ngc 2099 , the adopted isochrones and fitting techniques had as large , if not larger , of an effect on its cluster parameters as did any systematics between the cluster s different photometry sets .",
    "this is best illustrated by the systematic effects on derived cluster ages , where the yi et  al .",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter y@xmath3 ) and the ventura et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) isochrones both gave our final adopted age of 520 myr for ngc 2099 .",
    "the parsec version 1.2s isochrones ( bressan et  al .",
    "2012 ) derived a comparable age of 540 myr , and lastly the girardi et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) and bertelli et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) isochrones both gave significantly younger ages of 445 myr .",
    "between these isochrone sets there is nearly a 100 myr range of derived ages when using identical photometry , and further systematics can be introduced based on how the isochrones are fit to the data .    in this paper",
    "we have redetermined as uniformly as possible the reddenings , distance moduli , and ages for these six clusters using available high - quality ubv photometry that covers up to the full turnoff .",
    "the y@xmath3 isochrones provide our final adopted cluster ages , but to broaden our results we also determine ages with the parsec isochrones .",
    "these two isochrones give only slightly different cluster ages , but in these younger clusters the masses of the progenitor stars have a far more significant dependence on evolutionary time , and even a 20 myr systematic has a significant effect on our results .      in our cluster",
    "photometric analysis we first make use of color - color diagrams ( b - v vs u - b ) , which provide direct photometric information on the cluster reddening . the photometric metallicity can also be derived but it is quite sensitive to systematics in u magnitude , a concern considering the typically more complex standardization process for u magnitudes and the varying sources of our photometry",
    "therefore , in the case of the pleiades , ngc 2168 , and ngc 2516 we consider more detailed spectroscopic metallicities , but for ngc 2287 , ngc 2323 , and ngc 3532 we will simply adopt solar metallicity .",
    "however , we note that these adopted metallicities do show strong consistency with the observed photometry .",
    "our color - color analysis adopts two techniques , the first is semi - empirical and based on the hyades fiducial and the second is based directly on the y@xmath3 isochrones , which reach to higher masses than those available in the hyades fiducial . for both methods",
    "the reddening relation adopted is that of cardelli et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) and the metallicity correction is based on that of the y@xmath3 isochrones .",
    "the methods using the hyades fiducial have been developed in deliyannis et  al .",
    "( in prep ) , where the fiducial was derived from single - star cluster members ( see perryman et  al .  1998 ) .",
    "the hyades ubv photometry of johnson & knuckles ( 1955 ) was adopted with a cluster [ fe / h ] of + 0.15 and e(b - v ) of 0 .",
    "the pleiades provides a good example for our color - color analysis techniques . in the left panel of figure 2",
    "we have plotted the photoelectric ubv photometry from johnson & mitchell ( 1958 ) with several reddening curves based on the hyades fiducial , and we have applied a metallicity of [ fe / h]=0.01 ( z=0.0185 ) to match the reddening insensitive region where all of the reddening curves intersect near b - v of 0.6 .",
    "fitting by eye the blueward color - color trend we find that a reddening curve of e(b - v)=0.03@xmath170.02 matches the pleiades ubv photometry the best . both this reddening and metallicity are consistent with the typically derived values and spectroscopic analyses of the pleiades ( e.g. , [ fe / h]=0.01@xmath170.02 schuler et  al .",
    "2010 ; [ fe / h]=0.03@xmath170.02@xmath170.05 soderblom et  al .",
    "2009 ) we also note that the hyades fiducial ends at b - v@xmath00.1 , where the older hyades turnoff occurs .",
    "in the right panel of figure 2 we fit the higher - mass stars bluer than b - v=0.0 with three different 135 myr y@xmath3 isochrones of differing metallicity .",
    "all three metallicities fit a reddening of e(b - v)=0.03 in these bluest stars .",
    "this demonstrates that these higher - mass stars create a nearly linear trend that is insensitive to variations in metallicity .",
    "we note that the position of this blue linear trend is also insensitive to cluster age , where as we look at older clusters the trend only shortens in length and does not shift its position .",
    "therefore , this linear trend s position provides a reliable reddening measurement independent of all other cluster parameters .        in the upper left panel of figure 3",
    "we compare directly our hyades fiducial fit and our y@xmath3 fit for the pleiades .",
    "there are systematic differences that are noted in the b - v range of 0.1 - 0.3 , where it appears that the y@xmath3 isochrones are too blue in u - b relative to both the data and the hyades fiducial .",
    "however , when adopting a y@xmath3 isochrone with an age consistent to the hyades ( 650 myr ; not shown ) the isochrone is nearly identical to that of the hyades fiducial , so at these younger ages the isochrones appear to overestimate the u flux at this intermediate color range . at all other colors",
    "this does not seem to be a concern because , reassuringly , both the hyades fiducial and the y@xmath3 isochrones find the same reddening in their respective regions , and they also agree in the region sensitive to metallicity ( b - v@xmath00.6 ) and redder . in regard to the parsec isochrones , they are not independently considered in our color - color analysis because their u - b colors do not fit the observations .",
    "a key advantage to color - color analysis is that it can be used to clean young cluster turnoffs .",
    "dating younger clusters is prone to several difficulties , including that turnoffs are relatively sparse even in the richest clusters and that these higher - mass turnoff stars have high binarity fraction ( kouwenhoven et al .",
    "2007 ) . additionally , many higher - mass stars fall into the peculiar groups of blue stragglers or be stars .",
    "for example , mermilliod 1982a , 1982b , and ahumada & lapasset ( 2007 ) found that several of the brightest stars in the clusters being analyzed in this paper are blue stragglers that are far too blue or too bright , if not both , for their age .",
    "lu et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) modeled the formation of blue stragglers on the short time scales necessary in these young clusters and found that they can rapidly be created through binary mass transfer . identifying these peculiar stars",
    "can greatly improve the fit of the turnoff ages of these younger clusters .",
    "mermilliod 1982b do find that when plotted in color - color space be stars deviate from the approximately linear trend of the ",
    "normal \" high - mass stars .",
    "additionally , several of our clusters may have variable reddening , and fitting this high - mass linear trend identifies the richest group of cluster stars with consistent reddening . in the pleiades shown in the upper - left panel of figure 3",
    ", we mark in red the high - mass stars consistent with the trend , and several stars deviate from this trend that are likely peculiar .",
    "however , we do acknowledge that the brightest star in the pleiades , alcyone , does not deviate from this trend .",
    "alcyone is a multiple system and has several peculiar characteristics like spectral emission and rapid rotation ( hoffleit & jaschek 1991 ) and is commonly referred to as both a blue straggler and be dwarf .",
    "this suggests that while this color - color method does identify many problematic stars , it does not remove all peculiar stars .    in the upper right panel of figure 3",
    "we have similarly plotted the ngc 2323 ubv photometry from claria et  al .",
    "we fit the bluest stars and see that independent of an assumed metallicity , we find a large reddening of e(b - v)=0.23@xmath170.06 at ( b - v)@xmath31=0 , where we deem this reddening large enough to account for the color dependence of reddening ( see fernie 1963 and our discussion in paper i ) .",

    "lawds11 is an extreme outlier with a far longer cooling time than the other members of ngc 2168 , giving it a massive progenitor . for clusters in the rich galactic plane , contamination from common field white dwarfs",
    "is expected and likely explains this white dwarf .",
    "proper motions may be necessary to further constrain its membership , but in our current analysis and ifmr fits we do not consider lawds11 .    in our initial analysis from paper i",
    ", we demonstrated that the intermediate - mass white dwarfs ( 0.70.9 m@xmath1 ) create a steep ifmr slope . with the continued adoption of y@xmath3 ages in this paper , which systematically derive older ages in young clusters , we find",
    "there is no meaningful change in slope at higher masses and the data appears to be defined well with a weighted linear relation : @xmath89 the linear nature of the ifmr across such a broad range ( 36.5 m@xmath4 ) is of interest .",
    "for example , this may suggest we can extrapolate to derive the progenitor of a chandrasekhar mass limit white dwarf to be @xmath07.75 m@xmath1 , but the still limited data at the highest masses and the remaining uncertainties in the evolutionary models suggests this is unreliable .",
    "furthermore , in theoretical models a moderate turnover in the slope of the ifmr is predicted near initial mass of 4 m@xmath1 ( e.g. , marigo & girardi 2007 and meng et  al .",
    "this predicted turnover is the result of the second dredge - up , which only occurs in stars of @xmath04 m@xmath1 and higher .",
    "this diminishes their core mass and hence their final white dwarf mass .",
    "a comparable turnover could still be lost in our data s remaining scatter , causing further problems with a linear extrapolation . in figure 9",
    "we more closely analyze the residuals of this linear data fit .        to illustrate the importance of our adopted isochrones ,",
    "the right panel of figure 8 shows a clear turnover in the ifmr near an initial mass of 4 m@xmath1 when adopting parsec isochrone based ages , consistent with theoretical predictions .",
    "we note that while our comparison ifmr data from paper i adopts y@xmath3 isochrone ages , this is not the cause of the strong overturn .",
    "this is because in these older clusters ages from paper i the systematics shift direction and the parsec isochrones give cluster ages 20 myr older than the y@xmath3 isochrones . for the intermediate - mass comparison ifmr",
    "this would increase its slope by @xmath05% , and this would further increase the magnitude of the turnover .",
    "we fit the data based on the parsec ages for our younger clusters with a two - piece linear function with a kink at initial mass of 4 m@xmath1 : @xmath90    this is a strong turnover , one that is stronger than predicted in marigo & girardi ( 2007 ) or meng et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) . taking a moment to focus specifically on ngc 3532 may help to clarify these systematic differences .",
    "this is both because it is the only cluster with progenitors that cover both above and below initial mass of 4 m@xmath1 , and it is the cluster least effected by systematic differences between the y@xmath3 and parsec isochrones .",
    "the ngc 3532 data alone is limited but consistent with an overturn , which suggests the y@xmath3 may be overestimating the ages of the youngest clusters , but the massive progenitors of the pleiades white dwarfs in the right panel of figure 8 conversely suggests that the parsec isochrones may be underestimating the ages of the older clusters .",
    "further work is needed on isochrones and evolutionary times at these higher masses , but for now we continue to adopt our y@xmath3 isochrone results as final .        in figure 10",
    "we compare to multiple empirical ifmrs from weidemann ( 2000 ) , dobbie et  al .",
    "( 2006a ) , cataln et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , casewell et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , kalirai et  al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and salaris et  al .",
    "we find that our relation based on y@xmath3 ages gives that the ifmr is steeper at higher masses than all of these relations besides those of dobbie et  al .",
    "( 2006a ) and cataln et",
    "al.(2008 ) , which have comparable slopes .",
    "our relation is strongly consistent with that of cataln et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) , but the zeropoint of dobbie et  al .",
    "( 2006a ) is @xmath00.05 m@xmath1 lower .",
    "therefore , in comparison to most previous relations , ours predicts that white dwarf mass increases more rapidly with increasing progenitor mass , and that overall mass - loss rates are lower .",
    "this finding is primarily the result of our ages being systematically older due in part to our analysis cleaning the turnoffs of peculiar stars .",
    "additionally , the y@xmath3 isochrones give systematically older ages in comparison to the commonly adopted girardi et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) isochrones .",
    "for example , a consistent turnoff fit to the pleiades with the isochrones of girardi et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) gives a 100 myr age , 35 myr younger than the y@xmath3 isochrones .",
    "the most remarkable difference to previous ifmrs is that the large scatter has significantly decreased by @xmath050% .",
    "this not only illustrates the importance of doing uniform analysis of the white dwarf spectra , but of the consistent examination of the cluster parameters with detailed consideration of peculiar stars in the turnoffs .",
    "our ifmr s relatively smaller scatter also begins to show that while variations in mass - loss rates may still occur during a progenitor s lifetime , in singly evolved stars it is likely quite minor and the previously observed scatter is not indicative of stochastic mass loss .",
    "metallicity dependence of the ifmr is another important parameter to consider , but it will not be quantitatively analysed here with such incomplete metallicity information . for our three clusters pleiades ,",
    "ngc 2168 , and ngc 2516 with spectroscopic metallicity determinations , however , we note that the high - mass white dwarfs from the metal - poor ngc 2168 primarily fall above the mean of the ifmr while the white dwarfs from the slightly metal - rich ngc 2516 fall below the mean .",
    "direct comparison of the ngc 2323 white dwarfs to the rest of our sample shows that they deviate more from the relation than a majority of the others .",
    "individually , their errors in white dwarf mass are large enough to make these deviations not appear significant , but both white dwarfs being so consistent suggests that this deviation may be telling us something . for example , in comparison to the progenitors of the three comparable mass white dwarfs in other clusters ( lb 1497 , ngc 2168-lawds27 , and ngc 2287 - 4 ) , their three progenitors are all higher mass with lb 1497 giving a @xmath01.2 m@xmath1 larger progenitor .",
    "is this indicative of mass - loss variations between these different clusters or remaining systematics ?",
    "for example , a possible explanation for this is that our assumed solar metallicity for ngc 2323 is not appropriate .",
    "a more metal - rich isochrone would give a younger age and help to decrease the observed differences in progenitor masses . or this deviation may simply be the result of potential systematic differences between our adopted photometries , and in general this may be a cause for much of the remaining scatter in our total ifmr . in any case , this new ngc 2323 white dwarf analysis further emphasizes the importance of this nearby , rich , and young open cluster , and of the need for spectroscopic metallicity and precise ubv photometry spanning from its turnoff to its faint white dwarfs .",
    "we have spectroscopically observed a sample of 10 white dwarf candidates in the young and rich ngc 2323 . while we only found that two of these white dwarfs are consistent with membership in ngc 2323 ,",
    "they are both newly discovered high - mass white dwarfs at @xmath01.07 m@xmath1 . to supplement these new white dwarfs",
    "we have reanalyzed all published , publicly available high - mass white dwarfs from the pleiades , ngc 2516 , ngc 2168 , ngc 2287 , and ngc 3532 star clusters and sirius b.    at these higher masses , the inferred progenitor masses are increasingly dependent on the adopted star cluster ages .",
    "therefore , we uniformly analyzed available high - quality ubv photometry for these clusters .",
    "due to the difficulties of analyzing younger cluster ages , we have analyzed both color - color diagrams and color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "the color - color diagrams provide a self - consistent manner to not only determined a cluster reddening but to identify peculiar stars in each cluster s turnoff . with the cleaned turnoffs for each cluster",
    ", we can more precisely determine a cluster age .",
    "in general , we find cluster ages moderately older than those adopted in previous ifmr analyses , and we attribute this both to cluster peculiar stars affecting previous age determinations and the systematically older ages derived from the y@xmath3 and parsec isochrones .    application of our derived white dwarf cooling ages and cluster turnoff ages gives us the progenitor masses for each white dwarf .",
    "the two massive white dwarfs from ngc 2323 at 1.07 m@xmath1 both find remarkably consistent progenitor masses of 4.69 m@xmath1 . with the addition of the publicly available high - mass white dwarfs ,",
    "the derived ifmr is quite clean , and we find that with y@xmath3 ages the ifmr can be well defined by a linear relation from progenitor masses of 3 to 6.5 m@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , adoption of the only moderately younger cluster ages from the parsec isochrones gives a moderate turnover in ifmr slope near initial mass of 4 m@xmath1 . in our current analysis",
    "we continue to adopt the y@xmath3 results , but this draws attention to the work that is needed on evolutionary timescales at these higher masses .",
    "our ifmr also finds a significantly decreased scatter in comparison to recent ifmr work .",
    "this shows that the typically observed scatter in the ifmr is likely not indicative of real variations in mass loss for singly evolved stars , but was the result of remaining systematics .",
    "the ifmr relation is now reassuringly consistent across multiple star clusters .",
    "metallicity , however , still may play an important role , in particular at these higher masses . to further improve the ifmr , not only",
    "are newly discovered high - mass white dwarfs needed , but uniform ubv photometry and spectroscopic metallicity analyses are also needed .",
    "this will further limit systematics that may still remain and give the foundation for detailed quantitative analysis of the metallicity dependence of the ifmr .",
