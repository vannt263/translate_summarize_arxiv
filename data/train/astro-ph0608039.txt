    "stellar bars are recognized as the most important internal factor that redistributes the angular momentum of the baryonic and dark matter components of disk galaxies ( e.g. , weinberg 1985 ; debattista & sellwood 1998 , 2000 ; athanassoula 2002 ; berentzen , shlosman , & jogee 2006 ) , thereby driving their dynamical and secular evolution .",
    "bars efficiently drive gas from the outer disk to the central few hundred parsecs and are observed to feed central starbursts in local galaxies ( elmegreen 1994 ; knapen et al .  1995 ; hunt & malakan 1999 ; jogee et al .",

    "it remains a matter of contention whether large - scale bars relate to agn activity in galaxies , given the reduction by several orders of magnitude needed in the specific angular momentum of gas before it can feed a central black hole , and conflicting observational results ( see review by jogee 2006 and references therein ; also mulchaey & regan 1997 ; knapen et al .",

    "our analysis procedure is schematically illustrated in figure 1 and described in sections 3.1 to 3.4 .",
    "we start with the sample s2 of 180 galaxies imaged in both the @xmath7 and @xmath5 bands ( fig .",
    "we first remove stars from the @xmath7- and @xmath5-band images of each galaxy by replacing them with the average of the sky background using a circular aperture .",
    "we then find the center of the galaxy using the iraf routine ` imcenter ' .",
    "we determine a maximum galaxy semi - major axis length ( @xmath35 ) out to which ellipses will be fitted in each image by finding out where the galaxy isophotes reach the sky level .",
    "we then use the standard iraf task ` ellipse ' to fit ellipses to each image out to @xmath35 .",
    "we employ an iterative wrapper developed by jogee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to run ` ellipse ' up to to 300 times for each object in order to get a good fit across the whole galaxy .",
    "a successful fit is one where the routine is able to fit a ellipse at each radial increment from the center until it reaches @xmath35 .",
    "when using the iraf task ellipse for ellipse fits , the goodness of the best fit is measured by four harmonic amplitudes ( a3 , a4 , b3 , b4 ) , which describe by how much the actual isophote differs from the best - fitting ellipse ( e.g. , jedrzejewski 1987 ) . we have inspected plots of these residuals for representative strongly and weakly barred galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 4314 , ngc 613 , ngc 1187 , ngc 0210 , ngc  1300 , ngc  7479 , ngc  5701 , ngc  4643 , ngc  4548 , ngc  4450 , ngc  3681 , ngc  3275 , ngc  1703 , and ngc  1358 ) . we find that the a3 and b3 residuals are small , typically on the order of a few percent .",
    "values for the a4 and b4 residuals typically range from 2% to 10% , and do not exceed  15% .    from the final fit for each galaxy ,",
    "we generate radial profiles of surface brightness ( sb ) , ellipticity ( @xmath36 ) , and position angle ( pa ) .",
    "the fitted ellipses are over - plotted onto the galaxy images to generate overlays .",
    "examples of the radial plots and overlays are shown in figures 2 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "for each galaxy , an interactive visualization tool ( jogee et al .",
    "2004 ) is used to display both the radial profile and the overlays in order to perform an extra inspection of the fits .",
    "of the 180 galaxies in sample s2 , 179 ( 99% ) and 169 ( 94% ) were successfully fitted in the @xmath5 and @xmath7 band , respectively .",
    "of the 11 galaxies that could not be fitted in the @xmath7 band , five had strong morphological distortions and seem to be interacting ; one had a very bright , saturated star with leakage ; and five had no clearly defined center .",
    "the latter five galaxies were all of later hubble type ( sbc and sc ) , and had very flat or irregular surface brightness profiles in the @xmath7 band .",
    "further analyses to characterize inclined , unbarred , and barred disks in @xmath25 3.2 were then restricted to the sample s3 of 169 galaxies with successful fits in both the @xmath7 and @xmath5 bands ( fig .",
    "1 ) .      for sample s3 ,",
    "we use the @xmath7-band images , rather than the @xmath5-band images , to identify and characterize the outer disk because the former are deeper and trace the disk farther out . from the radial profiles generated by ellipse - fitting the @xmath7-band image",
    ", we measure the ellipticity ( @xmath37 ) and pa ( pa@xmath38 ) of the outer disk .",
    "the outer disk inclination , @xmath39 , is derived from @xmath37 using cos(@xmath39 )  =  ( 1  -  @xmath37 ) .",
    "of the 169 galaxies in sample s3 , we find 33 ( 20% ) galaxies with disk inclination @xmath40 and classify them as ` inclined ' .",
    "they are listed in the lower part of table 1 .",
    "figure 2 shows an example of the @xmath7-band radial profile and ellipse overlays for an inclined galaxy .",
    "we only use the final sample s4 ( fig .",
    "1 ) of 136 moderately inclined ( @xmath41  60@xmath42 ) spirals to further characterize the properties of bars ( e.g. , size , ellipticity , frequency ) and disks in @xmath25 3.33.4 .",
    "such an inclination cutoff is routinely applied in morphological studies because projection effects make it very difficult to reliably trace structural features in a galaxy that is close to edge - on .",
    "the exclusion of highly inclined galaxies does not bias the distribution of hubble types , as shown in figure 3a , where the hubble types of samples s3 and s4 are compared .",
    "the absolute @xmath31-band magnitudes ( @xmath43 ) of both sample s3 and s4 cover the range -18 to -23 , with most galaxies lying in the range @xmath44  -20 to -22 ( fig .",
    "3b ) .      in @xmath25 3.4 ,",
    "we use the _ deprojected _ radial profiles of ( sb , @xmath36 , pa ) to characterize the intrinsic properties of bars and disks in sample s4 .",
    "however , we also decide to first perform the analysis on the _ observed _ radial profiles _ before _ deprojecting them to face - on .",
    "there are several reasons for this dual approach of deriving bar properties both before and after deprojection .",
    "first , it is useful to have bar properties ( e.g. , frequency , strength as characterized by ellipse - fitting , size ) prior to deprojection to compare directly to studies at intermediate redshifts ( jogee et al .",
    "2004 , elmegreen et al .",
    "2004 , zheng et al .",
    "2005 ) , where deprojection is not done for several reasons , including the difficulty in accurately measuring the pa of the line of nodes and the inclination of the outer disk in noisy images of distant galaxies .",
    "second , by having bar properties both before and after deprojection , we are able to assess whether deprojection makes a substantial difference to the statistical distributions of bar properties",
    ". a large difference would raise concerns for intermediate redshift studies or even for large nearby studies where deprojection is often not carried out .    for sample s4 , we use the observed radial profiles of ( sb , @xmath36 , pa ) and the ellipse overlays to classify galaxies as ` unbarred ' ( fig .",
    "4 ) or ` barred ' ( fig .",
    "5 ) , according to the following quantitative criteria .",
    "a galaxy is classified as barred if the radial variation of ellipticity and pa follows the behavior that is expected based on the dominant orbits of a barred potential .",
    "specifically the following conditions must be satisfied before a galaxy is deemed to be barred : ( 1 )  the ellipticity , @xmath36 , increases steadily to a global maximum , @xmath14 , greater than 0.25 , while the pa value remains constant ( within 10@xmath42 ) .",
    "this criterion is based on the fact that the main bar - supporting orbits , namely the ` @xmath45 ' family of orbits , can be modeled by concentric ellipses with a constant pa as a function of radius in the bar region ( athanassoula 1992a ) .",
    "the requirement that the pa must remain constant in the bar region is important for excluding other spurious elliptical features that may mimic a bar signature in their ellipticity profile .",
    "( 2 )  then , at the transition from the bar to the disk region , the ellipticity , @xmath36 , must drop by at least 0.1 , and the pa usually changes .",
    "this criterion is justified by the fact that we expect a transition from the highly eccentric @xmath45 orbits near the bar end to the more circular orbits in the disk .",
    "we also note that the drop in ellipticity by 0.1 at the transition from bar to disk has been shown to work well in identifying bars ( e.g. , knapen et al .",
    "2000 ; laine et al .  2002 ; jogee et al .  2002a , 2002b , 2004 ) .",
    "what are the limitations of criteria ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in identifying bars ?",
    "we note that the ` constant pa ' criterion that we use to identify bars may cause us to miss some weak bars at optical wavelengths due to the following reason . in weak bars ,",
    "the shock loci and corresponding dust lanes on the leading edge of the bar are curved ( athanassoula 1992b ) . in optical images of weak bars",
    ", these curved dust lanes may cause the pa to twist or vary slightly along the bar , thereby preventing the ` constant pa ' criterion from being met . in the case of very strong bars , the ` constant pa ' criterion is a good one and isophotal twist is not an issue , because such bars have strong shocks and straight dust lanes along their leading edges ( athanassoula 1992b ) . in order to gauge how many bars we might be missing because of the ` constant pa ' criterion",
    ", we identify galaxies that show a pa twist accompanied by an ellipticity maximum .",
    "it turns out that only a small fraction ( @xmath3  7% ) of galaxies show this effect .",
    "we also note that criterion ( 1 ) requires the peak ellipticity ( @xmath46 ) over the pa plateau to be greater than 0.25 before we call a feature a bar .",
    "we picked 0.25 for the practical reason that structures with lower ellipticities are quite round and not always readily distinguishable from disks .",
    "nonetheless , one may be tempted to ask whether we would find more bars if this arbitrary limit of 0.25 were to be lowered , and whether there is a population of low - ellipticity ( e.g. , @xmath47  0.100.25 ) bars that we might miss .",
    "we investigated this question using the osubsgs sample , and find that there is no increase in the number of bars if the limiting value for @xmath14 in criterion ( 1 ) were to be lowered from 0.25 to 0.10 .",
    "the reason for this becomes clear later , in figure 13 , which shows that the number of bars already starts to drop rapidly for ellipticities below 0.40 , such that by the time we reach @xmath14 of 0.25 , we are already probing the tail end of bar distributions .",
    "in addition to classifying galaxies as ` barred ' and ` unbarred ' , we also use the radial profiles to derive the structural properties of the bar and disk .",
    "specifically , for all galaxies , we measure the ellipticity , pa , and semi - major axis of the outer disk ( @xmath37 , pa@xmath38 , @xmath48 ) . for galaxies classified as ` barred ' , we also measure the maximum ellipticity ( @xmath46 ) , the pa , and the semi - major axis of the bar .",
    "we will discuss in @xmath25  4.3 how the maximum bar ellipticity ( @xmath14 ) constrains the bar strength . here",
    ", we discuss the question of how to locate the end of the bar in order to measure the bar semi - major axis .",
    "there has been some discussion in the literature as to whether the bar end should be defined as the radius ( @xmath16 ) where the bar ellipticity is a maximum , or as the radius where the pa changes abruptly at the transition from the bar to the disk . from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "several early simulations ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992a ; oneill & dubinski 2003 ) show that the definition of bar length based on ` peak ellipticity ' can underestimate the true extent of the bar .",
    "recently , martinez - valpuesta , shlosman , & heller ( 2006 ) have performed a systematic study of the radius ( @xmath16 ) of maximum bar ellipticity and the bar length .",
    "they show that there is a very good correspondence between two independent methods to determine the bar size : ellipse fitting and orbital analysis .",
    "the orbital analysis has involved finding the largest ( jacobi ) energy @xmath45 orbit in the bar that is still stable . the ellipse fitting becomes better if the size of the bar is given by the radius where the ellipticity declines by 15% from its maximal value .    in his empirical study of bar sizes using ellipse fits , erwin ( 2005 )",
    "argues that using the pa signature to define the bar size provides an upper limit , and that the two measures of bar length are very well correlated .",
    "however , he finds that it is harder to unambiguously measure the bar size from the pa criterion and that the definition of bar size based on peak ellipticity is more readily applied consistently to a large number of different galaxy morphologies ( erwin 2005 ) . in this study , we have adopted the first approach .",
    "we use the semi major axis ( @xmath16 ) where the maximum bar ellipticity occurs as a measure of the bar length .",
    "we caution that this may underestimate the bar length in some galaxies .",
    "however , a visual comparison of @xmath16 with the images of our galaxies suggests that @xmath16 does a reasonable job in most cases .      for sample s4",
    ", we use the inclination , @xmath39 , and the pa of the outer disk ( determined in @xmath25 3.2 ) to _ analytically _ deproject the observed @xmath5 and @xmath7 band radial profiles of ( @xmath36 , pa ) to face - on .",
    "we perform the analytical deprojection using a code developed by laine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and used previously in laine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and jogee et al .",
    "( 2002a , b ) .",
    "it should be noted that the deprojection formula used in the code only strictly applies to infinitesimally thin structures , and may be inaccurate near the galaxy center in the vicinity of the bulge .",
    "however , it is a reasonable approximation in the region of interest where large - scale bars reside .",
    "figure 6 shows an example of the deprojected radial profiles of ngc 4548 in the @xmath7 and @xmath5 bands overlaid on the observed profiles .",
    "we note that the process of analytically deprojecting the radial _ profiles _ to face - on after ellipse - fitting the observed ( i.e , un - deprojected ) images is analogous to the process of first deprojecting the observed _ images _ to face - on , and then ellipse - fitting the deprojected images in order to generate face - on radial _ profiles_. the two methods should yield the same results unless the images are very noisy .",
    "we verified this expectation with the following steps .",
    "( 1 ) we deproject the _ images _ of several galaxies using the multichannel image reconstruction , image analysis and display ( miriad ) routine ` deproject ' .",
    "the routine takes as input the observed image , the galaxy center , the inclination @xmath39 and pa of the outer disk , and outputs the deprojected image ; ( 2 ) we then fit ellipses to these deprojected images using the procedure outlined in @xmath25  3.1 , and generate face - on radial profiles of sb , @xmath36 , and pa ; ( 3 ) these face - on radial profiles generated from the deprojected images , are compared with the deprojected radial profiles derived analytically from the the observed profile .",
    "there is good agreement in all cases , showing that we are not noise limited .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 7 for the @xmath7 band image of ngc 4548 .",
    "the observed and deprojected images are shown in the left panel . in the right panel ,",
    "three radial profiles are plotted : the observed radial profile derived by fitting ellipses to the observed image is plotted as stars ; the deprojected radial profile derived analytically from the observed profile is plotted as squares ; and the face - on radial profile derived by fitting ellipses to the deprojected image is plotted as triangles .",
    "there is good agreement between the squares and the triangles .",
    "the deprojected profiles provide an accurate characterization of the ` intrinsic ' or face - on properties of disks and bars . for all galaxies in s4",
    ", we therefore use the analytically deprojected @xmath7 and @xmath5 radial profiles to classify galaxies as ` barred ' or ` unbarred ' , according to the criteria outlined in @xmath25 3.3 .",
    "we also re - measure the bar ellipticity ( @xmath46 ) , semi - major axis ( @xmath49 ) , and disk size @xmath48 from the deprojected radial profile . in the rest of this paper , many of these deprojected quantities will be compared to those derived before deprojection ( @xmath25 3.3 ) in order to gauge the impact of deprojection .",
    "table 2 and figure 8 show the bar fraction ( defined as the fraction of spiral galaxies that are barred ) for the @xmath7 and @xmath5 bands , both before ( @xmath25  3.3 ) and after deprojection ( @xmath25  3.4 ) .",
    "the results are based on sample s4 of 136 moderately inclined ( @xmath50 ) spirals ( @xmath25  3.2 ) .",
    "the sample is dominated by galaxies with @xmath44  -20 to -22 .",
    "we find a deprojected bar fraction of 60% in the @xmath5 band and a lower fraction of 44% in the @xmath7-band images , which likely miss bars obscured by dust and star formation .",
    "our results that 60% of spirals are barred in the infrared confirms the preponderance of bars among spirals in the local universe .",
    "our @xmath5-band bar fraction of @xmath3  60% is in agreement with the nir bar fraction of 59% ( menendez - delmestre et al .",

    "why is there a 12% deviation ?",
    "the eskridge et al .  ( 2000 ) paper does not give ` barred ' or ` unbarred ' classifications for individual galaxies , so we can not make a case by case comparison with that study . however , in a subsequent paper , eskridge et al .",

    "we conclude that , as might be intuitively expected , the differences between visual and quantitative classifications of bars are strongest for systems that visually appear as ` weakly barred ' .",
    "how does our study compare with other quantitative studies ?",
    "we find that our reported @xmath5-band bar fraction of 60% agrees with that of laurikainen et al .",

    "we present a more detailed comparison of our bar ellipticity and fraction with other studies in @xmath25  4.3 .",
    "another important result is that deprojection does not make any significant changes to the global bar fraction , when dealing with the fairly large osubsgs sample .",
    "as shown by table 2 and figure 8 , the @xmath7- and @xmath5-band bar fractions are 45% and 58% before deprojection , and change by only a factor of 0.97 and 1.03 , respectively , after deprojection .",
    "we suggest several reasons for the small impact of projection effects .",
    "first , this study uses only moderately inclined ( @xmath51  60@xmath42 ) galaxies where projection effects are less severe than in highly inclined systems .",
    "second , projection effects produce large changes in the morphology of a galaxy only when the disk inclination , @xmath39 , is significant _ and _ the difference in pa between the bar and the disk major axes is close to 90@xmath42 . from a statistical point of view , these two conditions are unlikely to occur simultaneously in a dominant fraction of the sample .",
    "these arguments are supported by figures 9a and 9b , which show that the galaxy classes assigned prior to deprojection are in no way biased by the galaxy inclination , @xmath39 : both barred and unbarred galaxies span a similar range in @xmath39 . furthermore ,",
    "even the bar ellipticity @xmath14 measured before deprojection is uncorrelated with @xmath39 ( figs .",
    "9c and 9d ) .",
    "the fact that the bar fraction in large samples is similar before and after deprojection is encouraging for large studies of bars at intermediate redshift ( e.g. , jogee et al .",
    "2004 , elmegreen et al .",
    "2004 , zheng et al .  2005 ) , where deprojection is not done because of the difficulty in accurately measuring the pa of the line of nodes and the inclination of the outer disk in noisy images of distant galaxies .",
    "as outlined in @xmath25 3.1 , we use the semi major axis @xmath16 , where the bar ellipticity is a maximum , as a measure of the bar length .",
    "we caution that this may underestimate the bar length in some galaxies .",
    "however , a visual comparison of @xmath16 with the images of our galaxies suggests that @xmath16 does a reasonable job in most cases .",
    "the distributions of bar sizes or semi - major axes ( @xmath16 ) before and after deprojection are shown for the @xmath7 and @xmath5 bands in figure 10 . some bars",
    "do appear larger after deprojection , but from a statistical point of view , deprojection does not have a substantial effect on the bar size distribution .",
    "for example , the mean bar size in the @xmath5 band before deprojection is 3.4 kpc and after deprojection it is 4.0 kpc .",
    "sizes of large - scale bars in the local universe lie in the range @xmath3  1 to 14 kpc , with most ( 68% in @xmath7 and 76% in @xmath5 ) bars having @xmath52 5 kpc , and @xmath3  50% of them clustering with @xmath16 in the range 2 to 5 kpc",
    ". if such a distribution of bar sizes is present at a redshift @xmath8  1 , where @xmath53 corresponds to 8.0 kpc , then only observations with angular resolutions superior to @xmath54 can adequately resolve the majority of bars .",
    "this is relevant for assessing the relative effectiveness of current nir capabilities , such as nicmos , and those of future planned missions , such as wfc3 , in detecting high redshift bars in the nir band over wide fields .    in figure 11",
    ", we plot the bar size versus the disk size before and after deprojection .",
    "the bar size is measured from the @xmath5 band , whose low extinction enables more accurate measurement than in the optical .",
    "the disk is measured from the @xmath7-band image , which is deeper than the @xmath5 band and traces the disk further out ( @xmath25 3.2 ) . both before and after deprojection",
    ", we find that bar and disk sizes are correlated with an average slope of @xmath3  0.9 , albeit with a large scatter of several kpc in bar size at a given disk size .",
    "figure 12 shows the observed bar semi - major axis distribution normalized to @xmath17 ( the radius in arcseconds of the isophote , where the surface brightness equals 25 mag arcsec@xmath55 ) of the disk .",
    "@xmath17 values are obtained from the nearby bright galaxies catalogue ( tully 1988 ; hereafter nbg ) , except for ngc 6753 , 6782 , 5078 , 6907 , 7814 , and eso 142 - 19 , which are from the rc3 .",

    "furthermore , the prevalence of chaotic orbits between the 4:1 and the corotation resonance ( cr ) would naturally lead bars to end somewhere between the two resonances . if bars end very near the cr as is found observationally ( e.g. , merrifield & kuijken 1995 ; debattista et al .",
    "2002 ; aguerri et al .",
    "2003 ) , then our result that ( @xmath16/@xmath17 ) is generally well below 1.0 suggests that the cr of disk galaxies lies well inside their @xmath17 radius .",
    "furthermore , the correlation between bar and disk sizes and the narrow range in ( @xmath16/@xmath17 ) suggests that the growths of the bar and disk may be intimately tied .",
    "the term ` bar strength ' is not well defined in the literature .",
    "various measures of bar strength are used and each measure has some benefits and trade - offs .",
    "these measures include the @xmath26 method ( block et al .  2002 ; buta et al .  2003 ; buta et al .",
    "2005 ) , the maximum ellipticity of the bar , bar / interbar contrasts , fourier decomposition techniques ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "1996 ) , and visual estimates of strength ( e.g. , martin 1995 ; eskridge et al .",

    "the @xmath26 method ( block et al .  2002 ; buta et al .",
    "2003 ; buta et al .",
    "2005 ) directly measures the gravitational torque exerted by the bar , but it measures the torque at only one point along the bar .",
    "the @xmath26 method depends on the scale height of the disk and the ability to derive a reliable model for the potential using images .",
    "it is hard to apply this method to a large number of intermediate redshift galaxies due to resolution and signal - to - noise limitations . in the bar / interbar contrast method used by elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1985 ) and elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , the bar strength is characterized by the ratio of the peak surface brightness in the bar region to the minimum surface brightness in the interbar region .",
    "the fourier decomposition method also used by elmegreen & elmegreen ( 1985 ) and elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is similar to the @xmath56 method .",
    "it characterizes bar strength by measuring the relative amplitudes of the fourier components of the bar .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the m=2 mode determines the strength of a bar .    in studies where",
    "ellipse fits are used to characterize bars , the maximum ellipticity of the bar ( @xmath14 ) is used as a measure of bar strength ( e.g. , athanassoula 1992a ; martin 1995 ; wozniak et al .  1995 ;",
    "jogee et al .  1999 , 2002a , b ; knapen et al .",
    "2000 ; laine et al .  2002 ) .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that the bar ellipticity can be estimated without making any assumptions about the mass to light ratio of the galaxy or its scale height .",
    "it can also be applied to local galaxies as well as galaxies out to intermediate redshifts ( @xmath1  0.21.0 ; jogee et al .",
    "2004 , elmegreen et al .",
    "there are also several theoretical reasons that support the use of the maximum bar ellipticity as a measure of bar strength .",
    "shen & sellwood ( 2004 ) compare bar strength in n - body simulations , as characterized by the @xmath57  =  2 fourier components and the peak ellipticity .",
    "they find that the ellipticity is very well correlated to bar strength estimator @xmath58 , where @xmath58 is the relative amplitude of the bisymmetric ( @xmath57  =  2 ) fourier component of the mass density averaged over a certain inner radial range where the bar dominates .",
    "in addition , from an observational standpoint , laurikainen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find that , on average , the gravitational torque , @xmath26 , and @xmath14 are correlated for @xmath59  0.6 . for higher @xmath14 values , the relation appears to flatten out although the small number of galaxies precludes a firm conclusion .    nonetheless , if we deem that a measure of bar strength should give an indication of the gas inflow rate that a bar drives via gravitational torques , then the maximum ellipticity of the bar ( @xmath14 ) is only a _ partial _ measure of the bar strength . both the mass and shape of the bar influence the magnitude of the gravitational torque at each point along the bar .",
    "the peak bar ellipticity describes the shape of the bar , but does not directly measure its mass or luminosity .",
    "while bearing this caveat in mind , we use the maximum bar ellipticity @xmath14 as a partial measure of the bar strength in this study .",
    "figure 13 shows the observed and deprojected distributions of bar strength as characterized by @xmath14 from ellipse - fits in the @xmath7 ( figs .",
    "13a , c ) and @xmath5 bands ( figs .",
    "13b , d ) .",
    "it is striking that only a very small proportion ( 7% in @xmath7 ; 10% in @xmath5 ) of bars are very weak with 0.25  @xmath15  0.40 , while the majority of bars ( 70% in @xmath7 ; 71% in @xmath5 ) have moderate to high strengths as characterized by @xmath14 , with 0.50  @xmath15  0.75 .",
    "this point is further illustrated in figure 14 , which is a generalized plot of the fraction of disks with ` strong ' and ` weak ' bars .",
    "it shows how the fraction of spiral galaxies that host bars with ellipticities ( @xmath60 ) changes as we vary @xmath61 .",
    "as we increase @xmath61 from 0.35 to 0.45 , 0.55 , and 0.75 , the deprojected bar fraction in the @xmath7 band falls from 43% to 39% , 34% , and 7% , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the bar fraction in the @xmath5 band falls from 59% to 47% , 30% , and 1% , respectively .",
    "the flattening of the curve around @xmath62  0.40 shows that the majority of bars have @xmath14 above this value .",
    "this has implications for theoretical models that address the robustness of bars , and we refer the reader to @xmath25  4.6 for a discussion .    how do our results on bar strength as characterized by the maximum bar ellipticity @xmath14 from ellipse - fitting compare with those of buta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who use the @xmath63 parameter ? at first glance , the results may seem contradictory : they conclude that 40% of the galaxies in the osubsgs @xmath5 band have ` weakly barred ' or unbarred states ( @xmath64 ) , whereas we find that only 6% of galaxies have ` weak ' bars with @xmath65 in the @xmath5 band after deprojection .",
    "however , it should be noted that buta et al .",
    "( 2005 ) group unbarred and weakly barred galaxies together .",
    "their cited fraction of 40% for weak and unbarred states is , in fact , fully consistent with the fraction ( 46% ) that we find when we group together unbarred galaxies ( 40% ) and ` weakly barred ' galaxies ( 6% ) .",
    "how do the bar classes and bar strengths from ellipse - fits , as derived by our quantitative method ( @xmath25  3.3 ) , compare with the rc3 bar classes based on visual inspection of optical @xmath7 images ( de vaucouleurs et al .",

    "clearly , only a small fraction ( 41% or 19/46 ) of galaxies with rc3 bar class ` ab ' qualify as barred in @xmath7-band images , according to our quantitative criteria ( @xmath25  3.3 ) .",
    "we visually inspected the remaining 27 galaxies that fail to qualify in order to investigate why they do not .",
    "we found that for 17 of them , we could not identify a bar feature in the @xmath7-band image , even by eye .",
    "for the remaining 10 , we could visually see a somewhat elongated feature , but it does not satisfy the ellipticity and pa criteria outlined in @xmath25  3.3 . another interesting point highlighted by figure 15",
    "is that while the mean bar strength ( as characterized by @xmath66 ) is higher for rc3 visual class ` b ' than for class ` ab ' , the two classes have significant overlap in the range @xmath67  0.50.7 .",
    "thus , rc3 bar types should be used with caution and may be misleading .",
    "it is also noteworthy that figure 13 shows no evidence for bimodality in the distribution of bar strength , as characterized by @xmath14 from ellipse fits , in the @xmath7 or @xmath5 bands , in agreement with buta et al .",
    "what about the bimodality claimed in earlier studies by abraham & merrifield ( 2000 ) and whyte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ? both of these studies used the parameter @xmath24 to characterize the ellipticity of the most elliptical feature of a galaxy , and measure @xmath24 for both barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "they report no bimodality in @xmath24 among barred galaxies , which is consistent with our findings that @xmath14 shows no bimodality among barred galaxies .",
    "the only bimodality that they report in @xmath24 is between barred and unbarred galaxies .",
    "it is unclear how robust this bimodality is since whyte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report a bimodality that is much weaker than the one seen by abraham & merrifield ( 2000 ) .",
    "the authors assigned this weakening to the larger sample size used by whyte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at any rate",
    ", we can not make any direct comparison with their bimodality results involving unbarred galaxies , since we measure @xmath14 in barred galaxies , but not in unbarred galaxies .",
    "the reason for this selective measurement is rooted in our rigorous approach for identifying a bar . in the study of abraham & merrifield ( 2000 ) and whyte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , a bar is simply considered as the innermost feature whose isophote has the highest ellipticity . in contrast , we use a rigorous approach for identifying a bar : we call a feature a bar only if its radial variation of ellipticity and pa follows the behavior expected based on the dominant orbits of a barred potential , as outlined in @xmath25  3.3 .",
    "we measure the maximum bar ellipticity @xmath14 only for those features that qualify as a bar .",
    "figure 16 shows how the fraction of barred disks varies across different hubble types in sample s4 .",

    "important factors influencing the bar include the triaxiality of the dm halo in which it lies ( e.g. , berentzen , shlosman , & jogee 2006 ) ; the amount of angular momentum that the dm halo can absorb ( athanassoula 2003 ) ; the central mass concentrations ( cmcs ) present in the inner few hundred pc ( e.g. , shen & sellwood 2004 ; athanassoula et al .",
    "2005 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .  2006 ; debattista et al .",
    "2006 ) ; and the distribution and amount of gas in the disk ( e.g , shlosman & noguchi 1993 ; bournaud et al .",
    "2002 , 2005 ; debattista et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this section",
    ", we compare our empirical results to different simulations in order to constrain theoretical scenarios .",
    "we note , however , that most simulations do not yet fully incorporate the effects of star formation and feedback , which can impact the evolution of the disk in important ways .",
    "dubinski ( 1994 ) showed that the triaxiality of dm halos is diluted by baryonic dissipation .",
    "recent simulations by berentzen , shlosman , & jogee ( 2006 ) find that bars embedded in triaxial non - rotating dm halos can only survive if the inner halo ellipticity is washed out .",
    "otherwise , the interaction between the bar and the dm halo induces chaotic orbits and destroys the bar . in the present paper ,",
    "our findings that the majority ( 60% ) of spirals are barred in the infrared ( @xmath25  4.1 ) , and that these bars have primarily moderate to high strengths , as characterized by the maximum bar ellipticity @xmath14 ( 0.50  @xmath15  0.80 ; @xmath25  4.3 ) , suggest that dm halos of most present - day spirals are close to axisymmetric , with a maximum equatorial axial ratio of @xmath3  0.9 in potential .",
    "these limits may change slightly if one allows the dm halo to have a figure of rotation .",
    "these results are consistent with kazantzidis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who find that in the very early stages of disk formation , the settling of the dissipative baryonic component within a triaxial halo strongly dilutes the triaxiality to such values .",
    "berentzen & shlosman ( 2006 ) also report that a growing disk is responsible for washing out the halo prolateness ( in the disk plane ) and for diluting its flatness over a period of time comparable to the disk growth .",
    "the cmc typically refers to the mass present within the inner hundred or few hundred pc .",
    "a large or more centrally concentrated cmc can weaken a bar amplitude by changing the orbital structure of a barred potential and inducing chaotic orbits .",
    "most recent simulations ( e.g. , athanassoula et al .  2005 ; shen & sellwood 2004 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .  2006 ; debattista et al .",
    "2006 ) find that bars are more robust than previously thought : in order to produce any significant reduction in bar strength , the ratio @xmath75  @xmath3  ( @xmath76/@xmath77 ) , where @xmath76 is the mass of the cmc in the inner few hundred pc , and @xmath77 is the disk mass , must be very large , at least 10% .",
    "such large values are only of academic interest and are not realized in present - day galaxies , as we discuss below .    in present - day galaxies , the components that contribute to the cmc in the inner few hundred pc consist of super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) central dense stellar clusters , gaseous concentrations , and the inner parts of bulges .",
    "smbhs have typical masses in the range 10@xmath7810@xmath79  @xmath80 and tend to scale as 0.001 of the bulge mass ; gaseous concentrations range from 10@xmath8110@xmath79  @xmath80 in the central 500 to 1000 pc radius ( e.g. , jogee et al .",
    "2005 ) ; and central dense stellar clusters typically have masses in the range 10@xmath7810@xmath82  @xmath80 .",
    "these components typically lead to @xmath75 values that are much lower than 10% .",
    "this suggests that cmcs that exist in present - day galaxies are not large enough to produce any significant reduction in bar strength .",
    "our results are consistent with these expectations and with simulations that support robust bars .",
    "we found that the majority ( @xmath3  71%80% ) of bars have moderate to high strengths , as characterized by @xmath14 from ellipse - fitting ( 0.50  @xmath15  0.80 ) .",
    "we also found that the bar fraction ( @xmath3  60% ) and mean bar strength , as characterized by ellipse fits ( @xmath83  0.5 ) , is relatively constant across rc3 hubble types sa to scd ( @xmath25  4.4 ) , although the latter encompasses a wide range of gas mass fractions , cmc masses , and cmc components .",
    "gas can affect the formation and evolution of a bar in different ways , depending on its distribution and clumpiness . in the case of an unbarred disk ,",
    "the accretion of cold gas makes the disk more massive , dynamically colder , and therefore more bar unstable ( e.g. , bournaud et al .",
    "however , in the case of very gas - rich disks , the gas can become clumpy , and the effect of dynamical friction on massive gas clumps at low radii can heat the disk and prevent it from forming the bar ( e.g. , shlosman & noguchi 1993 ) . in the case of a disk that is already barred , the bar exerts gravitational torques that drive gas located outside the corotation resonance ( cr ) outward , and drive gas located between the cr and inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) inward .",
    "most simulations to date ( e.g. , debattista et al .  2006 ; berentzen & shlosman in preparation ; curir et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest that gas inflows in present - day galaxies do not readily destroy bars .",
    "for instance , simulations ( e.g. , debattista et al .  2006 ) , can only destroy the bar when there are large gas inflows that build a very massive , soft cmc , of order 20% of the mass of the total baryonic ( gas and stars ) disk .",
    "furthermore , the simulations also suggest that gas which sinks into the center can become bar supporting if it forms stars .",
    "as discussed above , cmcs as large as 10% or 20% are not realized in present - day galaxies and the simulations therefore imply that gas inflows in present - day galaxies do not readily destroy bars . in the very early universe ,",
    "if extreme gas inflows and extreme cmcs are realized , the evolution of bars might be different .",
    "we note that simulations of bar - driven gas inflow by bournaud et al .",
    "( 2005 ) yield widely different predictions from those discussed above .",
    "the simulations of bournaud et al .",
    "( 2005 ) appear to destroy a bar even with a gas mass fraction ( gmf ) that is as low as 5% to 7% . here",
    ", the gmf is defined as the ratio of gas mass to the total mass of the stellar disk .",
    "a gmf of order 5% is easily met in present - day galaxies and these simulations would suggest , therefore , that strong bars in present - day galaxies are easily destroyed by bar - driven gas inflows ( bournaud et al .",
    "there is clearly a stark difference between the predictions of these simulations and the ones outlined in the previous paragraph .",
    "part of the reason why the simulations yield such different results might lie in the way the dm halo is modeled and the assumed ratio of dm halo mass to disk mass .",
    "the dm halo is live and dominates over the disk mass in debattista et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , while it is rigid and less massive than the disk in bournaud et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "what do our observational results suggest ?",
    "we found that at @xmath1  0 , only a small fraction ( @xmath3  7%10% ) of bars are very weak ( 0.25  @xmath15  0.40 ) , while the majority ( @xmath3  71%80% ) of bars have moderate to high strengths ( as characterized by the maximum bar ellipticity @xmath14 ) , with 0.50  @xmath84  0.80 .",
    "we also do not see any sign of bimodality in bar strength , as characterized by @xmath14 from ellipse fits .",

    "our results do not necessarily rule out models where bars are easily destroyed by bar - driven gas inflows .",
    "they do , however , imply that if such an easy destruction occurs , then there must be a very efficient mechanism that not only regenerates bars on a short timescale ( e.g. , block et al .",
    "2002 ; bournaud et al .",
    "2002 ) , but is also very well tuned to the bar destruction rate so that it can reproduce the observed constant optical bar fraction in bright galaxies over the last 8 gyr ( jogee et al .  2004 ; elmegreen et al .  2004 ;  @xmath25  4.5 ) .",
    "with the advent of high redshift @xmath0 surveys , such as the tadpole field , gems , goods , and cosmos , which trace bars in the rest - frame optical band out to @xmath1  1 , it becomes increasingly important to provide a reference baseline for bars at @xmath1  0 in the optical band .",
    "motivated by these considerations , we characterize the frequency and structural properties of bars at @xmath1  0 in the optical and nir bands , by ellipse - fitting the @xmath7 and @xmath5 images of 180 spirals in the osubsgs ( eskridge et al .",

    "<S> critical insights on galaxy evolution stem from the study of bars . with the advent of high redshift @xmath0 surveys that trace bars in the rest - frame optical band out to @xmath1  1 </S>",
    "<S> , it becomes increasingly important to provide a reference baseline for bars at @xmath1  0 in the optical band . </S>",
    "<S> we present results on bars at @xmath1  0 in the optical and near - infrared bands , based on 180 spirals in the osubsgs survey . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) the deprojected bar fraction at @xmath1  0 is @xmath2  @xmath3  60%  @xmath4  6% in the near - infrared @xmath5 band , and @xmath6@xmath3  44%  @xmath4  6% in the optical @xmath7-band images . the latter likely miss bars obscured by dust and star formation . ( 2 )  the results before and after deprojection are similar , which is encouraging for high redshift studies that forego deprojection . ( 3 ) studies of bars at @xmath8  0.21.0 ( lookback times of 38 gyr ) have reported an optical bar fraction of @xmath9@xmath3  30% @xmath4 6% , after applying cutoffs in absolute magnitude ( @xmath10 - 19.3 ) , bar size ( @xmath11 1.5 kpc ) , and bar ellipticity ( @xmath12  0.4 ) in order to ensure a complete sample , adequate spatial resolution , and reliable bar identification out to @xmath1  1 . applying these exact cutoffs in magnitude , bar size , and bar ellipticity to the osubsgs data yields a comparable optical @xmath7-band bar fraction at @xmath1  0 of @xmath13@xmath3  34%  @xmath4  6% . </S>",
    "<S> this rules out scenarios where the optical bar fraction in bright disks declines strongly with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) we investigate bar strengths at @xmath8  0 using the maximum bar ellipticity ( @xmath14 ) as a guide . </S>",
    "<S> most ( @xmath3  70% ) bars have moderate to high ellipticity ( 0.50  @xmath15  0.75 ) , and only a small fraction ( 7%10% ) have 0.25  @xmath15  0.40 . </S>",
    "<S> there is no bimodality in the distribution of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5-band bar fraction and @xmath14 show no substantial variation across rc3 hubble types sa to scd . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 )  rc3 bar types should be used with caution . </S>",
    "<S> many galaxies with rc3 types ` ab ' turn out to be unbarred and rc3 bar classes ` b ' and ` ab ' have a significant overlap in @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 6 )  most ( 68% in @xmath7 and 76% in @xmath5 ) bars have sizes below 5 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> bar and disk sizes correlate , and the ratio ( @xmath16/@xmath17 ) lies primarily in the range 0.1 to 0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the growth of bars and disks is intimately tied . </S>"
