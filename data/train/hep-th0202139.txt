    "the open @xcite has so far resisted all the attempts to find analytically its solutions corresponding to the true closed string vacuum or lower dimensional d - branes . on the other hand",
    "the solutions are known numerically @xcite and provide a good evidence for the sen s tachyon conjectures @xcite . the vacuum ( vsft ) @xcite , designed to describe the physics around the true tachyon vacuum has been conjectured to have purely ghost kinetic term , which then allows for some exact calculations .",
    "canonical choice of a ghost kinetic term has been recently proposed by gaiotto , rastelli , sen and zwiebach @xcite based on some earlier results of hata and kawano @xcite .",
    "it has been further discussed by okuyama @xcite .",
    "generic feature of pure ghost kinetic terms in vsft is that they allow for simple construction of solutions in terms of projectors in the matter part of the algebra .",
    "it has been proved that such solutions indeed have the right ratios of tensions to be interpreted as d - branes @xcite .",
    "to determine however the absolute normalization turned out to be quite problematic .",
    "as we will show , on general grounds one should expect some sort of divergences in the normalization of the action . to deal with the problem , the authors of @xcite added a small term to the kinetic operator proportional to @xmath0 . with this regularization they observed that the numerical solution in the limit of removed regulator approaches a new type of a projector , called butterfly projector",
    "the poetic name comes from the shape of the surface which represents these kind of states in the conformal field theory .",
    "some properties of these states were also reported in @xcite . for other very recent development in the vsft see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we would like to get more insight into the problem of classical solutions and butterfly states in vsft by an extension of the analysis of our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to study implications of anomalous symmetries of the witten s vertex for classical solutions of the action .",
    "these techniques turn out to be remarkably useful in this new context .",
    "they show that in the vacuum one inevitably encounters some sort of singularities . for the regularized version of the theory we obtain infinite set of nontrivial identities which",
    ", as we show , are fulfilled for the simplest butterfly state .",
    "the identities are so constraining , that among all well defined surface states they uniquely pick up one particular state , which even happens to be a projector .",
    "it would be rather interesting if one could derive more identities which would then determine the projector uniquely in the the whole hilbert space , not necessarily in the subspace of surface states .",
    "it turns out to be possible to express any well defined surface state as a reparametrization of the vacuum in the form [ ufek ] u_f = e^k , which greatly simplifies calculations of some star products . here",
    "@xmath1 stands for some linear combination of the generators @xmath2 , which are known to act as exterior derivatives in the algebra .",
    "this fact has been shown in a recent paper @xcite for wedge states .",
    "it allowed to determine the star products of wedge states purely algebraically , without thinking much about gluing surfaces and various coordinate systems .",
    "particularly interesting class of states is the one of the form _ e^k .",
    "if the limit exists , then it gives states which are invariant under the reparametrization @xmath1 , i.e. they are annihilated by @xmath1 .",
    "these states are natural candidates for being projectors .",
    "for example the simplest butterfly surface state [ butt2 ] e^-l_2 = _ - e^k_2 is a projector .",
    "on the other hand the opposite limit [ butt2f ] e^+l_2 = _ + e^k_2 . is not a projector , we call it a ` false butterfly ' state",
    ". these kind of states ( [ butt2],[butt2f ] ) can be naturally generalized by replacing @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we study the consequences of the anomalous symmetries of the witten s three vertex for the classical solutions of the ordinary , vacuum and regulated vacuum theories .",
    "we derive an infinite set of identities , which as we show are obeyed by the simplest butterfly state .",
    "we then show in section 3 , that the butterfly states and their generalization are indeed projectors .",
    "we manage also to calculate the star product @xmath5 for arbitrary @xmath6 $ ] . in section 4",
    "we prove the uniqueness of the solution of the set of identities among the surface states . as a corollary",
    "we obtain a formula ( [ ufek ] ) .",
    "appendices contain some useful formulas for the exponentials of the virasoro operators , conservation laws for butterfly states and some numerical results for illustrative purposes .",
    "related work on butterfly states with some small overlaps with our work has been done independently by gaiotto , rastelli , sen and zwiebach and should appear simultaneously in @xcite .",
    "to start with , we shall recall first some identities for the tachyon condensate found in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "the action of witten s @xcite takes a nice form of chern - simons action @xmath7=-\\frac{1}{\\alpha ' g_o^2 } \\left ( \\frac 12 \\aver{\\phi , q \\phi } + \\frac 13 \\aver{\\phi,\\phi*\\phi } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the usual string brst operator .",
    "the star multiplication is given by a three vertex @xmath9 @xcite which satisfies various identities @xcite .",
    "for our purposes the most important are [ ansyms ] _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 ( l_-n^x(i ) - l_n^x(i ) ) & = & 3 k_n^x , + _ i=1 ^ 3 ( l_-n^gh(i ) - l_n^gh(i ) ) & = & -3 k_n^x , + _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 ( j_-n^(i ) + j_n^(i ) ) & = & 3 ( h_n^gh + 3_n,0 ) , valid for @xmath10 even and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote matter or ghost virasoro operators and @xmath13 are ghost current generators .",
    "the constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath10 even are given explicitly by k_n^x & = & ( -1)^n2 , + h_n^gh & = & - ( -1)^n2 .",
    "taking the variation of the action ( [ action ] ) under the infinitesimal variations of the @xmath16 [ variations ] & = & ( l_-n^x - l_n^x - k_n^x ) , + & = & ( j_-n + j_n - h_n^gh - 3_n,0 ) we see that they leave the cubic term in the action invariant . on the other hand",
    "we know that the total action should also be invariant , as long as @xmath16 satisfies equations of motion . combining these two facts we get from the kinetic term [ anids ] [ q , l_n^x ] & = & -k_n^x q , + [ q , j_n ] & = & h_n^gh q .",
    "these identities in the siegel gauge simplify to [ anidssiegel ] c_0 l_n^x & = & 1n k_n^x c_0 l_0^tot , + c_0 ( n j_n + l_n^tot ) & = & -h_n^gh c_0 l_0^tot , where @xmath17 is the total virasoro generator .",
    "they can be further rewritten as [ anidssiegel2 ] c_0 l_n^x & = & + ( -1)^ k , + c_0 l_n^gh & = & - ( -1)^ k , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are virasoro operators of the twisted ghost conformal field theory @xcite with central charge @xmath20 . note that the operators @xmath21 are singlets under the @xmath22 symmetry in the siegel gauge , discussed in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the vacuum ( vsft ) is that when the witten s is expanded around the nonperturbative vacuum , its action can be again written in the form @xmath23=-\\kappa_0 \\left ( \\frac 12 \\aver{\\psi , \\qq \\psi } + \\frac 13 \\aver{\\psi,\\psi*\\psi } \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the fluctuation around the new vacuum after suitable reparametrization and @xmath25 is some new brst - like operator which is nilpotent , acts as a derivation of the algebra and is conjectured to be purely ghost .",
    "recently it has been argued @xcite , that there are certain singular reparametrizations which lead naturally to one particular kinetic operator [ q - grsz ] = c_0 + _ k=1^(-1)^k ( c_2k + c_-2k ) .",
    "the major advantage of vsft with the purely ghost kinetic operator @xmath25 is that it allows for constructing d - branes in terms of projectors of the algebra .",
    "they have been shown exactly , using the methods of boundary conformal field theory and fock space oscillators , to have the right ratios of tensions @xcite .",
    "what is still missing , is to show that there is a solution corresponding to the original unstable d25-brane with the right tension .",
    "we will see that the analysis of the constraints analogous to those discussed in the previous subsection can shed some light on the nature of this d25-brane solution .",
    "let @xmath26 be a stationary point of the action ( [ vsftaction ] ) , i.e. a solution of the equations of motion @xmath27 .",
    "then the identities read [ anidsvsft ] [ , l_n^x ] & = & -k_n^x , + [ , l_n^gh ] & = & k_n^x , + [ , j_n ] & = & h_n^gh . for a generic @xmath25 which is purely ghost , the first equation implies that = 0 .",
    "it seems therefore to show that the tension of the d25-brane and of any other soliton is zero .",
    "the same conclusion follows for the particular choice ( [ q - grsz ] ) also from a combination of the second and third identity of ( [ anidsvsft ] ) in the siegel gauge .",
    "so , does this mean that the vsft can not describe finite tension d25-branes ?",
    "no , the argument merely shows that for the soliton solutions things become singular and one must be very careful . in the scenario advocated in @xcite for the emergence of purely ghost kinetic operator in vsft ,",
    "the constant @xmath28 in front of the action becomes naturally singular .",
    "when the action is carefully regularized we may hope to get the right finite answer .",
    "one might be curious whether the above argument definitely rules out the possibility that one day we find completely regular vsft action with purely ghost kinetic term and with finite action solutions . as a possible example of what could happen , the following toy version of vsft has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "suppose we start with a string field of ghost number zero and consider an operator @xmath29 , which is a dimension zero primary of ghost number three .",
    "take an action of the form [ ghn0sft ] s =  [ 12 ( y(i)+y(-i ) ) + 13 ( y(i)+y(-i ) ) ] . from the argument in @xcite",
    "it follows that for projectors which are surface states in the total virasoro algebra ( the sliver for example ) , the action is finite and equal to @xmath30 .",
    "so where does the argument breaks down ?",
    "it is quite simple to find few places in the case of the butterfly projector = e^-12 l_-2 , discovered in @xcite and discussed in more detail in section [ butterflies ] and in @xcite .",
    "easy check shows , that for example the conservation laws ( [ ansyms ] ) break down . indeed , for @xmath31 & & _",
    "j=1 ^ 3 ( l_-2^x(j ) - l_2^x(j ) ) ( y(i)+y(-i ) ) = + & & 3 k_2^x ( y(i)+y(-i ) ) = - , where @xmath32 is the central charge in the matter sector . in section [ butterflies ] we will see that some things are actually ill defined , for instance the inner product @xmath33 and even the star product @xmath34 itself .",
    "to conclude , our argument rules out possibility of finite action solutions which are sufficiently regular , it allows however for less well behaved solutions as are the projectors .",
    "in @xcite the following regularized action of the vsft in the siegel gauge has been proposed [ regvsftaction ] s_a[]=-_0(a ) ( 12 + 13 ) . the original gauge fixed vsft is recovered in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "it is perhaps curious that the other limit @xmath36 corresponds to the ordinary witten s theory .",
    "one might therefore hope that both actions share some features , and that is indeed true .",
    "let us write the constraints on the solutions to the equation of motion .",
    "since we are in the siegel gauge , we may write only identities based on variations @xmath37 , which preserve the gauge [ anidsregvsft ] c_0 l_n^x & = & ( -1)^ a k , + c_0 ( n j_n + l_n^gh ) & = & - ( -1)^ a k , where k = c_0(1 + 1a l_0 ) .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that in the limit @xmath35 the numerical solution of the equations of motion representing the d25-brane seems to approach the following state [ grszsol ] = e^-12 ( l_-2^x + l_-2^gh ) c_1 .",
    "we will now show that this solution is compatible with the infinite set of identities ( [ anidsregvsft ] ) even for finite @xmath38 .",
    "an immediate question is then , whether the solution ( [ grszsol ] ) is a unique solution of this set of identities .",
    "we will prove in section [ uniqueness ] , that it is indeed unique among the surface states in the deformed cft .",
    "it is most likely not unique among non - surface states , since for example in the limit @xmath39 corresponding to ordinary theory , we have another solution . to deal with non - surface states",
    ", one would almost certainly need more identities , which would differ from ( [ anidsregvsft ] ) by taking expectation values of products of more operators .    to check the identities we have to first regularize the solution ( [ grszsol ] ) = e^ s l_-2^x + s l_-2^gh c_1 keeping @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and let @xmath42 and @xmath43 approach @xmath44 .",
    "notice , that the regularized solution is not necessarily a solution of the regularized action .",
    "we are taking fixed finite @xmath38 and want to show that the identities are obeyed in the limit @xmath45 .",
    "let us focus first on the identity = - , which follows from ( [ anidsregvsft ] ) . by a straightforward calculation , whose details",
    "are given in appendices [ apptransf ] and [ reggrsz ] , we see that we have to require that in our limit [ fixedratio ] = is kept fixed . remarkably , making this single adjustment suffices to show that all other identities ( [ anidsregvsft ] ) are satisfied .",
    "using the formulas collected in appendix [ reggrsz ] we get [ ak ] ak = ( a c_0 + c_0 l_0^tot ) ()^ ^2 . here",
    "it is important , that we take first the limit @xmath45 for fixed @xmath38 , and only at the end when we get @xmath38 independent ratios we may send @xmath35 , if we wish so .",
    "we have also [ buttid ] c_0 l_2k^x & & ( -1)^k ()^ ^2 , + c_0 l_2k^gh & & -(-1)^k ()^ ^2 . the identities ( [ anidsregvsft ] ) now immediately follow from ( [ ak ] ) and ( [ buttid ] ) .",
    "let us make one more remark about the logic here .",
    "we have shown that with a finite regularization @xmath38 of the vsft action , the butterfly state exactly solves the infinite set of identities . in order to prove that , we had to regularize the state as we did .",
    "we have not shown , that it exactly obeys the equations of motion of the regularized theory .",
    "we will see in section [ detailedbutt ] however , that the regularized butterfly approximately solves the equations of motion of the regularized vsft , provided we identify @xmath46 and let it depend on @xmath38 in a definite way .",

    "the surface state associated to the map @xmath50 is defined as a linear functional on the hilbert space , which is just a bra vector , satisfying [ defsurf ] = = , . here",
    "@xmath51 is the operator corresponding to the state @xmath52 through the operator ",
    "state correspondence , and @xmath53 denotes its conformal transformation .",
    "the operators u_f = e^_n0 v_n l_n satisfying f ( z ) = u_f ( z ) u_f^-1 , form a representation of the conformal group on the hilbert space of the worldsheet cft .",

    "using conformal map h(z ) = , which maps the upper half plane with a coordinate @xmath58 one to one onto the unit disk with a coordinate @xmath59 we can evaluate the correlator ( [ defsurf ] ) as _ uhp = _ disk .",
    "the image of the unit upper half disk under the map @xmath60 is called local coordinate patch . for the simplest butterfly surface state corresponding to the map ( [ defbuttmap ] ) with @xmath61 the shape of the local patch",

    "[ figbutt2 ] . recall , that in this coordinate system the local coordinate patch for the sliver state looks just as a sliver .    there is another coordinate system with a coordinate @xmath62 , in which the local patch is mapped to the right half disk . in this coordinate system the star product of surface states",
    "is represented simply by gluing the surfaces with the local patch detached . for the butterfly state ,",
    "the part of the surface without the local patch looks as a butterfly , hence the name . for the sliver the surface in this coordinates looks as a helix of an infinite excess angle .    for general @xmath63 ,",
    "the butterfly states can be expressed explicitly as elements of the verma module ( representation space of the virasoro algebra ) [ buttr2 ] = u_r^e^- l_-2 , where @xmath64 are well known from the studies of wedge states @xcite .",

    "there is one preferred choice however and this is the reason why the first factor on the right hand side of ( [ phigf ] ) is @xmath98 . with this choice",

    "we need thus |z| ( r^-1,r ) r>1 . from what has been said",
    "now follows that the right location of the contour in ( [ ssevoft ] ) is inside the annulus of radii @xmath136 and @xmath137 . to calculate the integrand we need to use the transformation properties of the energy momentum tensor @xmath138 ft(z ) = (f(z))^2 t(f(z ) ) + s[f , z ] , where s[f , z ] = is the schwarzian derivative .",

    "the central charge @xmath89 appearing in the normalization constant @xmath140 might in principle be different from that of the energy momentum tensor we insert , but that is just a trivial extension of our formulas .",

    "even if we regularize the sliver by considering wedge state associated to the map [ wedgemap ] f_r(z ) =  ( z ) for large but finite @xmath63 , this function still has branch cuts starting at @xmath146 and going all the way to infinity .",

    "in fact it can not be deformed in any way to ensure the absolute convergence",

    "whatever @xmath63 independent regularization we decide for , the second term in the limit will not contribute .",
    "therefore a unique contribution comes from the first term ( [ slivid1term ] ) and we find for the sliver @xmath151 [ sliverid ] l_2k = k ( -1)^k , which is clearly different from ( [ qidsimpl ] ) .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath152 , which is divergent has been also calculated in @xcite .",

    "they are strictly speaking true only for @xmath153 and with the prescription that in the first term @xmath58 approaches the unit circle from outside , whereas in the second term from interior .",
    "when contracted with regular states , these stringent conditions can be relaxed to some annulus around the unit circle .    as a consequence of the equations of motion , if the cubic term is invariant under the variation , so has to be also the kinetic term . from",
    "that we find an important relation (2 + z ) t(z ) = 0 , whose unique solution is [ compid ] t(z ) = .",
    "this equation contains as much information as the original set of identities ( [ anids ] ) or ( [ anidsregvsft ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath154 depends on the type of the energy momentum tensor and is also related to the anomaly .",
    "details depend also on whether we are in vacuum or ordinary theory .",
    "now we are going to solve the equation ( [ compid ] ) in the space of surface states discussed in section [ testingids ] .",
    "due to ( [ utu ] ) our problem reduces to the equation [ sgeq ] s[i i f , z ] = , where we denote = e^- c. although the equation ( [ sgeq ] ) looks as a third order nonlinear differential equation we can find easily all its solutions . denoting g(z ) = i i f(z )",
    "we find the solution [ gsol ] g(z ) & = & h ( z^ ) , + g(z ) & = & h ( z ) = , where @xmath155 is an arbitrary @xmath156 map .",

    "the map @xmath155 is parameterized by three real parameters , just as many as the number of parameters necessary to specify the initial conditions of a third order differential equation .",

    "what we can do however , is to find a sequence of approximations @xmath159 for @xmath160 whose limit is @xmath161 and hope that the corresponding sequence of @xmath162 s whose uniqueness we shall prove , have always the same limit .",
    "this is just a technical assumption of smooth dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath78 .",

    "now we are going to determine the surface states , which actually solve our equation ( [ phiifeq ] ) with @xmath169 replaced by @xmath159 .",
    "there are two ways to proceed . based on our results from subsection [ butterex ]",
    ", we could guess and check that ( [ gndef ] ) requires f(z ) = and the limits @xmath167 correspond to the butterfly and false butterfly states .",
    "what about the uniqueness ?",
    "it seems that we are getting more solutions depending on @xmath10 , recall however , that different @xmath10 correspond to different @xmath154 which we take fixed in such a way , that the butterfly state @xmath170 solves the constraint . are there any other solutions ?",
    "we can prove uniqueness of the solution of the equation i i f(z ) = g(z ) for any given @xmath171 by the following reasoning : suppose there is another solution @xmath172 with @xmath173 $ ] such that i i f = i i f. since the operator corresponding to @xmath174 contains only negatively moded virasoro operators , we find @xmath175 and thus @xmath176 modulo some unimportant global rescaling .    an alternative procedure is to recall from @xcite that the map ( [ gndef ] ) is generated by a vector field @xmath177 , which obeys @xmath178 .",

    "this follows from the fact , that the function @xmath186 is generated by some @xmath1 and from the fact that @xmath187 is holomorphic around @xmath188 and hence the corresponding operator acts trivially on @xmath183 .",

    "solutions of the regularized version of vsft constructed by adding a term @xmath189 to the kinetic operator obey such a constraint , which among all the surface states admits unique solution which is just the simplest butterfly projector .",
