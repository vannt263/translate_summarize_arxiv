    "the current  @xcite and planed  @xcite set of accelerator - based neutrino experiments use extremely intense neutrino beamlines for precise measurements of the observed neutrino mass splitting and mixing angles and detailed experimental study of the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the data of these experiments will greatly extend the statistics due to extremely intense neutrino beamline .",
    "in this situation , the statistical uncertainties should be negligible as compared to systematic errors .",
    "an important source of systematic uncertainties is related to the neutrino - nucleus @xmath3 cross sections .",
    "the neutrino beams of high intensity cover the few - gev energy range . in this energy regime ,",
    "the dominant contribution to @xmath4 cross section comes from charged - current ( cc ) quasielastic ( qe ) scattering and resonance production processes . in the long - base line",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments near and far detectors are used to normalize the neutrino flux at production and to search for the neutrino oscillation effects . while many unknown quantities are eliminated in these experiments by considering ratios of far to near events ,",
    "the cancellation is not complete due to differences in neutrino flux and backgrounds in the near and far detectors .",
    "thus , in order to permit precision oscillation measurements it is important to have an accurate characterization of the ccqe differential cross sections over wide span neutrino energies .    the current data on ccqe scattering come from a variety of experiment operating at differing energies and with different nuclei . the existing data on ( anti)neutrino ccqe scattering come mostly from bubble chamber experiments , which suffer from small statistic . in general",
    ", the experimental execution and data interpretation are non - trivial for several reason .",
    "neutrino beams typically span a wide energy range .",
    "the neutrino flux itself is often poorly known and a background from resonance processes are frequently significant and it is difficult for separating from the ccqe signal . therefore the total qe cross sections measured in different experiments with accuracy of 20 - 40% and even within such large uncertainties some results contradict each other .",
    "the difference between the total quasielastic cross sections , calculated within the framework of various models  @xcite is lower than the spread in data .",
    "more information about neutrino - nuclear ccqe interaction can be obtained from the analysis of the charged - current qe event distributions and @xmath5 differential cross sections as functions of @xmath6 ( squared four - momentum transfer )  @xcite .",
    "the shape of these distributions is sensitive to the @xmath6 dependence of two vector , @xmath7 , one axial - vector @xmath8 form factors and nuclear effects .",
    "the vector form factors are well - known from electron scattering . for the axial - vector form",
    "factors the dipole parametrization with one free parameter @xmath0 ( axial mass ) is mainly used .",
    "this parameter controls the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath8 , and ultimately , the normalization of the predicted cross sections .",
    "the dipole parametrization has no strict theoretical basis and the choice of this parametrization is made by the analogy with electroproduction . to describe the nuclear effects ,",
    "neutrino ccqe models typically employ a relativistic fermi gas model ( rfgm )  @xcite in which the nucleons with a flat nucleon momentum distribution up to the same fermi momentum @xmath9 and nuclear binding energy @xmath10 .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath0 extract from the ( anti)neutrino ccqe scattering data , i.e. from the analysis of the shape of the @xmath6- distributions and from the direct measurements of the total cross sections .",
    "they show very wide spread from roughly 0.7 to 1.2 gev and the resulting world - average @xmath11 gev  @xcite .",
    "several experiments have recently reported new results on ccqe scattering from high - statistics data samples with intense , well - understood neutrino beams . the nomad experiment  @xcite observe an @xmath0 value and cross section ( from data taken on carbon ) consistent with prior world - average .",
    "however , data of  @xcite and  @xcite ( preliminary result ) , collected on carbon , oxygen , and iron targets , have indicated a somewhat larger value for @xmath0 ( by @xmath12 ) . in these experiments",
    "the shape of the @xmath6-distribution was analyzed .",
    "this data show a disagreement with the rfgm predictions .",
    "the data samples exhibit deficit in the region of low @xmath13 ( gev / c)@xmath14 ( so - called low- @xmath6 problem ) . as it is known the comparison with the low - energy qe electron - nucleus scattering data ,",
    "the rfgm description of this region is not accurate enough  @xcite . in the region of high-@xmath6 the data excess",
    "is observed , and value of @xmath0 , obtained from a fit to the measured data , is higher than the results of the previous experiments .",
    "the collection of existing results remains puzzling .",
    "the next experiments minerva  @xcite and microboone  @xcite as well as t2k  @xcite and nova  @xcite near detectors will be able to make more precise measurements of the ccqe cross sections in a wide range of energies and for various nuclear targets .",
    "the uncertainties in the theoretical description of the quasielastic neutrino - nucleus scattering could be considerably reduced if new model - independent absolute differential cross section could be provided .",
    "the first measurement of the flux - integrated double - differential cross section ( in muon energy and angle ) for ccqe scattering on carbon has been produced in miniboone experiment  @xcite .",
    "this cross section contains the most complete and model - independent information that is available from miniboone for the ccqe process .",
    "the aim of this work is to test the rfgm and relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) predictions against the miniboone data  @xcite . in the framework of these approaches",
    "we extract the values of axial mass from the measured flux - integrated @xmath5 cross section .",
    "then , we calculate with extracted values of @xmath0 the flux - integrated differential and flux - unfolded total cross sections and compare the results with data .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we present briefly the rdwia model and discuss the flux - averaged and flux - integrated differential cross sections .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "we consider neutrino charged - current qe exclusive @xmath15 and inclusive @xmath16 scattering off nuclei in the one - w - boson exchange approximation . here",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the initial and final lepton momenta , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the initial and final target momenta , @xmath21 is the ejectile nucleon momentum , @xmath22 is the momentum transfer carried by the virtual w - boson , and @xmath23 is the w - boson virtually .      the formalism of charged - current qe exclusive and inclusive reactions is described in  @xcite .",
    "all the nuclear structure information and final state interaction effects ( fsi ) are contained in the weak cc nuclear tensors @xmath24 , which are given by bilinear product of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear cc operator @xmath25 between the initial nucleus state @xmath26 and the final state @xmath27 as @xmath28 where the sum is taken over undetected states .",
    "we describe ccqe neutrino - nuclear scattering in the impulse approximation ( ia ) , assuming that the incoming neutrino interacts with only one nucleon , which is subsequently emitted , while the remaining ( a-1 ) nucleons in the target are spectators . the nuclear current is written as the sum of single - nucleon currents .",
    "then , the nuclear matrix element in eq.([eq3 ] ) takes the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the vertex function , @xmath31 is the recoil - corrected momentum transfer , @xmath32 is the invariant mass , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are relativistic bound - state and outgoing wave functions .    the single - nucleon charged current has @xmath35 structure @xmath36 . for a free - nucleon vertex function",
    "@xmath37 we use the cc2 vector current vertex function @xmath38 .",
    "the weak vector form factors are related to the corresponding electromagnetic ones for protons and neutrons by the hypothesis of the conserved vector current .",
    "we use the approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite on the nucleon form factors . because the bound nucleons are off shell we employ the de forest prescription  @xcite and coulomb gauge for off - shell vector current vertex @xmath38 .",
    "the vector - axial and pseudoscalar form factors are parametrized as a dipole with the axial - vector mass , which controls the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath39 , and ultimately , the normalization of the predicted cross section .    according to the jlab data  @xcite the occupancy of the independent particle shell - model ( ipsm ) orbitals of @xmath40c equals on average 89% . in this work",
    "we assume that the missing strength ( 11% ) can be attributed to the short - range nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath41 ) correlations in the ground state , leading to the appearance of the high - momentum ( hm ) and high - energy component in the nucleon distribution in the target . to estimate this effect in the inclusive cross sections we consider a phenomenological model which incorporates both the single - particle nature of the nucleon spectrum at low energy ( ipsm orbitals ) and the high - energy and high - momentum components due to @xmath41 correlations .    in the independent particle shall model the relativistic wave functions of the bound nucleon states @xmath33 are obtained as the self - consistent ( hartree bogoliubov ) solutions of a dirac equation , derived , within a relativistic mean field approach , from lagrangian containing @xmath42 , and @xmath43 mesons ( the @xmath44 model)@xcite .",
    "we use the nucleon bound - state functions calculated for carbon by the timora code  @xcite with the normalization factors @xmath45 relative to the full occupancy of the ipsm orbitals of @xmath40c : @xmath46=84% , @xmath47=100% , and an average factor of about 89% .",
    "these estimations of the depletion of hole states follow from the rdwia analysis of @xmath40c@xmath48 for @xmath49 ( gev / c)@xmath14  @xcite and are consistent with a direct measurement of the spectral function using @xmath40c@xmath48 in parallel kinematics  @xcite , which observed approximately 0.6 protons in a region attributable to a single - nucleon knockout fromcorrelated cluster . for the outgoing nucleon",
    "the simplest choice is to use plane - wave function @xmath50 , i.e. , no interactions is considered between the ejected nucleon @xmath51 and the residual nucleus b ( pwia - plane - wave impulse approximation ) . for a more realistic description ,",
    "fsi effects should be taken into account . in the rdwia",
    "the distorted - wave function @xmath50 are evaluated as solution of a dirac equation containing a phenomenological relativistic optical potential .",
    "the channel coupling in the fsi  @xcite of the @xmath52 system is taken into account .",
    "the relativistic optical potential consists of a real part which describes the rescattering of the ejected nucleon and of an imaginary part that accounts for absorption of it into unobserved channels .    using the direct pauli reduction method the system of two coupled first - order radial dirac equations",
    "can be reduced to a single second - order schrdinger - like equation for the upper component of dirac wave function @xmath50 .",
    "we use the lea program  @xcite for the numerical calculation of thedistorted wave functions with the edad1 parametrization  @xcite of the relativistic optical potential for carbon .",
    "this code , initially designed for computing exclusive proton - nucleus and electron - nucleus scattering , was successfully tested against a@xmath53 data  @xcite and we adopted this program for neutrino reactions .",
    "a complex optical potential with a nonzero imaginary part generally produces an absorption of the flux . for the exclusive a@xmath54 channel",
    "this reflects the coupling between different open reaction channels .",
    "however , for the inclusive reaction , the total flux must conserve . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the inclusive ccqe neutrino cross section of the exclusive channel a@xmath54 , calculated with only the real part of the optical potential is almost identical to those of the green s function approach  @xcite in which the fsi effects on inclusive reaction a@xmath55 is treated by means of a complex potential and the total flux is conserved .",
    "we calculate the inclusive and total cross sections with the edad1 relativistic optical potential in which only the real part is included .",
    "the inclusive cross sections with the fsi effects in the presence of the short - range @xmath41 correlations were calculated using the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "the contribution of the @xmath41 correlated pairs is evaluated in the pwia model .",
    "we use the general expression for the high - momentum and high - energy part of the spectral function from ref .",
    "@xcite with the parametrization for the nucleon high - momentum distribution from ref .",
    "@xcite , which was renormalized to value of 11% .",
    "the fsi effects for the high - momentum component is estimated by scaling the pwia cross section with @xmath56 function determined in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in neutrino experiments the differential cross sections of ccqe neutrino - nucleus scattering are measured within rather wide ranges of the ( anti)neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "therefore flux - averaged and flux - integrated differential cross sections can be extracted .    because the @xmath57- mode of beams incorporates @xmath57 and @xmath58 spectra the flux - averaged double differential cross section @xmath59 in muon kinetic energy @xmath60 and muon scattering angle @xmath61 is the sum of neutrino and antineutrino cross sections @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are weight functions .",

    "this flux depends on @xmath70 due to the limits of integration in eqs .  ,   and   which are functions of @xmath70 , i.e. @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the double differential cross sections , calculates within the rdwia and rfgm ( with the fermi momentum @xmath73 mev / c and a binding energy @xmath74 mev for carbon ) are shown as functions of neutrino energy .",
    "apparently the ranges @xmath75 $ ] where @xmath76 is not equals to zero are different in the rdwia and rfgm .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath77 is model - dependent and ultimately the weight functions and the cross section @xmath78 depend on nuclear models too .",
    "note that the flux @xmath77 should be used to extract the measured flux - averaged cross section in the _",
    "i , j_-bins of @xmath70 variables ( for example see eq.(3 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "similarly , the flux - averaged @xmath1 cross section can be written as sum @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the muon threshold energy after all cuts for ccqe events selection .",
    "the weight functions in eq .   are defined as follows @xmath82 where @xmath83d\\varepsilon_i\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the neutrino and antineutrino flux which gives the contribution to the measured cross section at the fixed value of @xmath6 .",
    "the flux is a function of @xmath6 because @xmath84 and @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the maximal energy in the ( anti)neutrino spectrum .",
    "the limit @xmath87 , and ultimately the flux @xmath88 depend on nuclear model . as a result",

    "the cross section @xmath5 is defined as @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the muon mass , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the limits of the kinematic allowed @xmath95-range at the fixed value of @xmath6 .",
