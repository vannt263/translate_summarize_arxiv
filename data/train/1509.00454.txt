    "@xcite , it has been shown that the correlation tensor could be utilized to construct entanglement indicators .",
    "the resulting indicators are in the form of nonlinear conditions ( we will show a detailed form in the next section ) , thus such indicators allow detection of entanglement in more classes of quantum states than linear entanglement witnesses .",
    "the study of @xcite was mainly done for multi - qubit systems .",
    "here , we consider pairs of systems , more complicated than qubits . in our approach",
    "we do not study the dynamics of noise , but we concentrate on properties of the state after evolving through a noisy channel .",
    "the white noise usually arises due to imperfections in experimental set up , while a colored noise can appear when multi - particle entanglement is produced via multiple emissions @xcite .",
    "we also analyze the effects of different local noises , modeling random environment and dissipative process @xcite .",
    "a study of this kind was done for qubits in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we study higher dimensions .",
    "we find that in some cases there exist significant differences for noise resistances of entanglement after transferring via various noisy channels .",
    "note that a different approach to obtain the criterion of separability of entangled qutrits in noisy channel is given in @xcite .",
    "another way to certify entanglement is to violate bell inequalities  @xcite . to this end",
    ", we consider collins - gisin - linden - massar - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality of arbitrary dimension @xmath8  @xcite . we calculate critical noise values to vanish a violation of the inequality for noisy entangled states .",
    "we also discuss the fidelity between the initial states and the states which are parametrized by the critical noise values .    finally , we compare difference of critical noise values between the detection of entanglement and the violation of cglmp inequality . such difference or gap",
    "is known as werner gap @xcite .",
    "it points to the fact that the notions of entanglement detection and violations of bell inequalities are not entirely equivalent .",
    "one can see the disparity between them in which one deals with noise admixture to the pure entangled states .",
    "separable states can be described by a fully separable extended correlation tensor , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and each @xmath11 is the @xmath12-dimensional generalized bloch vector of @xmath13th single qudit subsystem . to obtain entanglement conditions we employ a geometrical approach based on correlation functions , which was introduced in ref .",
    "the criterion has the following : the state @xmath14 described by its correlation tensor @xmath15 is entangled , if @xmath16 the scalar product may be defined in various ways , provided it satisfies all required axioms .",
    "however , the simplest choice is @xmath17 in such a case , the maximum of the left - hand side of ( @xmath18 ) can be obtained by the highest generalized schmidt coefficient of the correlation tensor @xmath15 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a @xmath21-dimensional generalized bloch vector which describes a quantum state of @xmath13th subsystem .",
    "note that , for @xmath22 we do not have a bloch sphere .",
    "thus @xmath20 s represent the admissible bloch vectors which represent a physical state .",
    "one can also take the maximum of the left - hand side of  ( @xmath18 ) as the square root of the highest eigenvalue of @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath24 . however , note that @xmath25 and this estimate gives a less robust criterion for entanglement .",
    "still it is technically much easier , and thus we shall use it .",
    "note that , the criterion is based on correlations of measurements and local measurements are enough to detect entanglement .",
    "this makes the method experimentally accessible .",
    "moreover , as we shall see below , for some cases our entanglement indicators require fewer local measurements , not full measurement settings ( i.e. , no necessity of the reconstruction for the density matrix ) . in that sense",
    "it is more efficient scheme than a full state tomography .",
    "we analyze entanglement of bipartite quantum states which are initially pure . for technical reasons we always put them in the schmidt form : @xmath26 we study various noisy channels , i.e. , white , product , colored , local depolarizing and amplitude damping . in some cases",
    ", one can define a critical parameter @xmath27 for the noisy output , of the form @xmath28 , such that for @xmath29 the state @xmath30 is entangled .",
    "the action of a channel on a density matrix of two - qudit can also be written in terms of its operation elements , more precisely @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is an operation element of the channel parametrized by @xmath33 a certain strength parameter to be specified later .",
    "we define this parametrization as @xmath34 defines no noise , just unitary ( local ) evolution , while @xmath35 signifies the maximally noisy state leaving the channel .",

    "the general form of the tensor elements is given in [ a ] .",
    "note that the schmidt form of the state does not imply a diagonal form of the corresponding tensor .",
    "even for a two - qutrit state non - diagonal elements appear .",
    "this is not the case for qubits .",
    "because of , the above reason , calculations of @xmath24 require the diagonalization of the tensor , which is a computationally difficult problem even for small @xmath8 .    for white , product , and colored noises we analytically compute the critical parameter @xmath40 for the maximally entangled states ( diagonal form of the correlation tensor ) of a pair of qudits : @xmath41 we present results for arbitrary @xmath8 and for @xmath42 .",
    "we also analyze all non - maximally entangled pure initial states of qutrits ( @xmath43 ) , parametrized as @xmath44 the study is also done for lower schmidt rank states , for @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48",
