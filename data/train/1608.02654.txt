    "the mass deformed abjm theory @xcite is the theory obtained by deforming the three dimensional @xmath5 @xmath6 superconformal chern - simons theory ( called the abjm theory ) @xcite with a set of relevant operators including mass terms for the bi - fundamental chiral multiplets .",
    "while the abjm theory describes the stack of @xmath1 m2-branes , the mass deformed abjm is expected to describe the bound states of the m2-branes and the m5-branes through the fuzzy sphere configuration given in @xcite .",
    "this theory has special features which makes it worth studying .",
    "one of them is that the theory has the @xmath6 supersymmetry , which is the ( almost ) maximum amount of the supersymmetries in three dimension .",
    "nevertheless this theory is not conformal , hence has non - trivial dynamics and a renormalization group flow .",
    "furthermore , in the large @xmath1 limit this theory will have a gravity dual which should be obtained by a deformation to the gravity dual of the abjm theory corresponding to the mass terms .",
    "therefore , this theory will be one of the basic models to be investigated in the large @xmath1 limit .    to study a supersymmetric field theory ,",
    "we can use the localization technique @xcite which enables us to obtain the exact partition function as well as some supersymmetric correlators .",
    "each of these results is , however , given typically by a matrix model , i.e. an integration over the @xmath7 matrix variables .",
    "it is highly non - trivial to take the large @xmath1 limit in these matrix models .    in this paper , as in our previous work @xcite , we continue to study the partition function @xmath8 of the mass deformed abjm theory on @xmath0 in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "results for the mass deformed abjm theory @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors analyzed the theory by continuing the chern - simons levels @xmath9 and @xmath10 to complex numbers , and obtained the saddle point solution which is different from our solutions discussed in the following sections .",
    "the solution in @xcite may correspond to those discussed in appendix [ sec_anothersol ] .",
    "also , in @xcite we found two solutions in the region of small mass parameter @xmath11 .",
    "we argue that one of them does not satisfy the saddle point equation at a boundary . ]",
    "we find new solution of the large @xmath1 saddle point equation with an arbitrary mass parameter and compute the free energy @xmath12 for the solution . as the free energy even though we consider the theory on @xmath0 .",
    "] we also generalize the ansatz to obtain the free energy @xmath13 @xcite in full extent , and find that the saddle point solution can not exist for the mass parameter larger than a certain critical value . because the classical supergravity on an asymptotically @xmath2 spacetime has @xmath13 , this result strongly suggests that there are no gravity duals for the mass deformed abjm theory on @xmath0 with the mass parameter larger than the critical value .",
    "this result seems surprising , as the critical mass is reached by a finite and relevant deformation from the abjm theory .",
    "nevertheless , we can argue that this phase transition indeed occurs .",
    "if the dimensionless mass parameter @xmath14 , which is the mass parameter normalized by the radius of @xmath0 , is small enough , the free energy @xmath15 will behave as @xmath16 since the theory reduces to the abjm theory in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "the factor @xmath18 can be interpreted as @xmath19 , hence this free energy is consistent with the classical supergravity . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath14 is sufficiently large we can integrate out the bi - fundamental hypermultiplets first in the computation of the partition function . as a result",
    "we will obtain @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , for the new solution we find the free energy scales like @xmath20 ( see and ) .",
    "therefore , there should occurs a phase transition in the interpolating regime , where the gravity dual of the abjm theory will be broken .",
    "the phase transition may be similar to the confinement / deconfinement transition if we regard the change of the mass parameter as a renormalization group flow .",
    "we will discuss this aspect in @xcite .",
    "note that this phase transition is absent in the @xmath21 supersymmetric yang - mills theories on @xmath22 which is an four dimensional analogue of the mass deformed abjm theory .",
    "for this theory in the strong t hooft coupling limit the saddle point solution and the free energy are smooth under the change of the mass parameter @xcite . indeed , the free energy of the @xmath23 supersymmetric yang - mills theory , which is the massless limit of the theory , is @xmath20 also , thus both of the massless and the infinite mass limits are consistent with the gravity duals and can be smoothly connected .",
    "needless to say , further investigations of the phase transition are desirable .",
    "in particular , we should study the vacuum solution in the supergravity corresponding to the mass deformed abjm theory on @xmath0 with an arbitrary mass parameter .",
    "we also expect that this kind of phase transition will occur also in the other theories on @xmath0 describing the m2-branes in various backgrounds such as @xcite .",
    "we hope to report on these in near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the partition function of the mass deformed abjm theory which is expressed as an @xmath24 dimensional integration .",
    "we also write down the saddle point equations to evaluate the large @xmath1 limit of the partition function . in section [ sec_finitek ] and",
    "section [ sec_thooft ] we solve the saddle point equations and determine the free energy @xmath25 , in the large @xmath1 limit for various values of the mass deformation parameter . in section [ sec_finitek ] we consider the problem in the limit @xmath26 with @xmath9 kept finite . in section [ sec_thooft ]",
    "we take the t hooft limit @xmath27 with @xmath28 finite . in both sections",
    "we also evaluate the vacuum expectation values of the @xmath29 bps wilson loops for the saddle point configurations and argue the interpretation of our results .",
    "section [ sec_disc ] is devoted for discussion and comments on future directions . in appendix [ sec_anothersol ]",
    "we comment on another solution to the saddle point equations for finite @xmath9 .",
    "this solution give the free energy which is larger than that obtained in the same parameter regime in section [ sec_finitek ] .",

    "hence in the regime @xmath98 the matter fields can be integrated separately as the massive free hypermultiplets , which gives @xmath99 this precisely reproduces the leading part of the free energy . on the other hand , after integrating out the matter multiplets in the mass deformed abjm theories we are left with the pure chern - simons theory ( with the induces yang - mills terms ) .",
    "the saddle point equations for the shifted eigenvalues @xmath100 and can be interpreted as the saddle point equations for the partition function of this reduced theory .    here",
    "we also comment on the f - theorem @xcite .",

    "we shall further assume that the profile functions @xmath133 and @xmath140 are piecewise continuous in @xmath141 for this choice of the ordering .",
    "we believe that the form ( [ ag ] ) is the most general form which gives @xmath124 . of course , there is no proofs for this , however , there should be non - trivial cancellation of @xmath142 and @xmath143 terms in the free energy in order to obtain @xmath124 , which makes finding other possible forms highly difficult .",
    "we will evaluate the free energy for the configuration ( [ ag ] ) which is indeed @xmath144 .",
    "the chern - simons term , which is proportional to @xmath9 , and the fi term , which is proportional to @xmath75 , are easily evaluated to @xmath145 for other logarithmic terms in the free energy , for example , @xmath146 we will use the decomposition @xmath147 where r(@xmath130 ) is a real function and the one replacing @xmath148 with @xmath149 .",
    "we take @xmath150 .",
    "then , we can see that the terms linear in @xmath151 cancel each others : @xmath152 remaining terms can be evaluated by using a formula ( here dot @xmath153 is the abbreviation for @xmath154 ) : @xmath155 for @xmath156 where @xmath157 @xmath158 and the path @xmath159 is a straight line between @xmath160 and @xmath161 with @xmath162 .",
    "note that the @xmath163 in the formula can be replaced with @xmath164 .",

    "we conclude that the free energy is @xmath172 where @xmath173 such that the condition @xmath174 is satisfied .",
    "] thus , if @xmath175 , then @xmath176 , which is the edge of the bound . ]    in the above derivation of the free energy @xmath117 , the assumption that @xmath177 is monotonically increasing ( after the eigenvalues are rearranged so that the profile functions are piecewise continuous in @xmath130 ) is crucial .",
    "this assumption is violated if the eigenvalue distribution has self - overlapping region after projected onto the real axis . in this case",
