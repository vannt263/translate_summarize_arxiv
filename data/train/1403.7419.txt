    "let @xmath0 be a convex co - compact hyperbolic surface , then this surface has infinite volume , finite genus and a finite number of funnels .",
    "the resolvent of the positive laplacian @xmath1 is usually defined as @xmath2 and on @xmath3 it is analytic in @xmath4 for @xmath5 .",
    "changing the function spaces this resolvent can be meromorphically extended to @xmath6 with poles of finite rank .",
    "the poles of this meromorphic continuation are called the resonances of @xmath7 and the multiplicity of a resonance is defined by the rank of the associated pole .",
    "the set of all resonances on @xmath7 repeated according to multiplicity will be called @xmath8 .",
    "the study of the distribution of resonances on infinite volume hyperbolic surfaces is of interest in number theory ( see e.g. the recent work of bourgain - gamburd - sarnak @xcite on the affine sieve ) as well as in the study of quantum chaos , because these surfaces provide an important model of open , classically chaotic systems ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "since the seminal work of patterson it is known that there is alway one resonance at @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the hausdorff dimension of the limit set @xmath11(see @xcite for @xmath12 and @xcite for @xmath13 ) . for the hyperbolic cylinder even the complete resonance spectrum can be computed , but apart from this special example there are no other explicit formulas for the location of individual resonances .",
    "however , it has been a very fruitful approach to prove coarser results on the distribution of resonances in the complex plane .",
    "for example guillop - lin - zworski @xcite proved a fractal weyl upper bound on the number of resonances near the critical line @xmath14 and naud @xcite the existence of a spectral gap , i.e.of a constant @xmath15 such that @xmath16 such asymptotic results on the resonance distribution have important analogons in theoretical physics @xcite and are even observable experimentally @xcite . despite the big progress in recent years",
    "there are still many open questions and conjectures .",
    "for example it has been conjectured that the fractal weyl upper bound is sharp and that , in the semiclassical limit , i.e.for @xmath17 the spectral gap can be extended to @xmath18 . for a more thorough discussion on recent progress on the distribution of resonances and open questions we refer to @xcite and references therein .    the existence of these open conjectures motivated borthwick to study the resonance spectrum on infinite volume hyperbolic surfaces numerically @xcite and to a great surprise he observed that the resonances on 3-funneled schottky surfaces are often highly ordered and form resonance chains .",
    "it has recently been shown in a numerical study by barkhofen , faure and the author @xcite that these resonance chains can be understood by a generalized zeta function and are related to a clustering of the length spectrum on @xmath7 and that the same kind of resonance chains also appear in various other physical systems ( for details on the significance of resonance chains in physics we refer to @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "_ statement of the results : _ in this article we will show the existence of resonance chains for 3-funneled surfaces by proving explicit formulas for individual resonances in a certain geometrical limit in the teichmller space . a 3-funneled schottky surface of genus zero is up to isometry uniquely defined by three positive real numbers @xmath19 which correspond to the funnel widths i.e.the lengths of the primitive closed geodesics that turns once around one funnel .",
    "the numbers @xmath19 are also called fenchel - nielsen coordinates of the teichmller space of 3-funneled surfaces ( cf .",
    "* section 13.3 ) ) and we will denote these surfaces by @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be positive integers , then we consider for @xmath22 the family of schottky surfaces @xmath23 with a fixed rational ratio of the funnel widths . in the limit @xmath24",
    "the system becomes more and more open and the dimension of the limit set tends to zero @xmath25 .",
    "one observes that in this limit not only the leading resonance at @xmath10 tends to zero but all other resonances do as well . in order to study a meaningful , nontrivial limit of the resonance spectrum , the spectrum has to be rescaled with @xmath26 and we define the set of rescaled resonances as @xmath27 then we obtain the following theorem for the rescaled resonances in the limit @xmath28 .    [ thm : location_res ]",
    "let @xmath29 be positive integers that fulfill a triangle condition i.e.they fulfill the inequality @xmath30 for any permutation of @xmath31 .",
    "let furthermore be @xmath32 and @xmath33 where the zeros are repeated according to the multiplicities .",
    "then for any bounded domain @xmath34 with @xmath35 we have @xmath36    note that @xmath37 can be chosen arbitrarily small , so theorem  [ thm : location_res ] states that a finite number of resonances is determined by @xmath38 at an arbitrary precision for large enough @xmath26 . as @xmath39 is the zero set of a polynomial in @xmath40 , this set naturally forms straight chains in the sense that @xmath41 theorem  [ thm : location_res ] then says that the rescaled resonance spectrum converges against straight resonance chains which are explicitly described by the polynomial @xmath38 .",
    "note that this convergence however only holds for an arbitrarily large but finite number of resonances and one can not suspect theorem  [ thm : location_res ] to hold uniformly for all resonances because this would contradict the fractal weyl conjecture on the number of resonances in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the limit @xmath42 thus can be understood as a limit complementary to the semiclassical limit which holds in the low frequency regime i.e.for a finite number of resonances . and in fact we will see in section  [ sec : num ] that @xmath38 describes the first 50 - 100 resonances already for relatively small values of @xmath43 .    in the proof of theorem  [ thm : location_res ]",
    "a generalized dynamical zeta function will play an important role and we will show that such generalized zeta functions always have an analytic extension .",
    "therefore we introduce @xmath44 as the set of all primitive closed geodesics on @xmath20 , where primitive means that the geodesic is not a repetition of a shorter closed geodesic .",
    "if we additionally denote for a closed geodesic @xmath45 its length by @xmath46 then we can state the following result .",
    "[ thm : gen_zeta_analytic ] let @xmath20 be a schottky surface with three funnels of widths @xmath19 and let @xmath21 .",
    "we define @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the winding number around the funnel of width @xmath49 .",
    "then the generalized zeta function @xmath50 extends to an analytic function on @xmath51 .",
    "similar to an ordinary dynamical zeta function , obtained by a bowen - series transfer operator , this generalized zeta function is equal to the selberg zeta function of @xmath20 for @xmath52 . beside its appearance in the proof of theorem  [ thm : location_res ] this result is also of independent interest as in @xcite it has been numerically shown that for the understanding of the resonance chains for finite @xmath26 these generalized zeta functions are the central object . the numerical algorithms used in @xcite and the interpretation of the results",
    "were also heavily based on the assumption that the generalized zeta function is analytic .",
    "the particularly simple structure of the resonance spectrum in the limit @xmath42 as stated in theorem  [ thm : location_res ] can finally be understood by the following result which states the in the limit @xmath28 the generalized zeta function of theorem  [ thm : gen_zeta_analytic ] is given by the polynomial @xmath38 .",
    "[ thm : rescaled_zeta_limit ] let @xmath29 be positive integers fulfilling the triangle condition .",
    "consider for @xmath22 the family of schottky surfaces @xmath53 then the generalized zeta function of this family of surfaces , as defined in theorem  [ thm : gen_zeta_analytic ] , also depends on the parameter @xmath26 and we denote it by @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath38 is the polynomial defined in ( [ eq : polynomial ] ) , then on any bounded set @xmath55 the rescaled generalized zeta function @xmath56 converges to the polynomial in the sense that @xmath57    the article is organized as follows : first we will recall some basic facts on the definition of schottky surfaces , their resonances and selberg zeta functions in section  [ sec : res_schottky ] . then , in section  [ sec : dyn_zeta ] , we recall the definition of the dynamical zeta function the way they are usually obtained using bowen - series maps and iterated function schemes ( ifs ) .",
    "while this traditional approach is very natural from an algebraic point of view , we will see that it is not natural from the geodesic flow point of view .",
    "section  [ sec : gen_zeta : limit ] will then be dedicated to an iterated function scheme whose dynamical zeta function also contain the selberg zeta function of the schottky surface but that is much better adapted to the geodesic flow .",
    "these _ flow - adapted ifs _ are then used to prove theorem  [ thm : gen_zeta_analytic ] on the analyticity of the generalized zeta functions .",
    "the flow - adapted ifs in addition turn out to be the central ingredient in treating the limit @xmath42 in section  [ sec : geom_limit ] .",
    "the idea in proving theorem  [ thm : location_res ] and theorem  [ thm : rescaled_zeta_limit ] is to write the generalized zeta function as a fredholm determinant of a transfer operator defined by the flow - adapted ifs .",
    "if one then considers the taylor expansion of this fredholm determinant it can be shown using techniques from jenkinson - pollicott @xcite , that in the limit @xmath42 only the first view terms survive .",
    "furthermore all remaining terms become particularly simple and cancel each other to a great extend . from a physical point of view",
    "the proof strategy is to show that the ideas which cvitanovic - eckhardt @xcite introduced under the name `` cycle expansion '' in physics become rigorous in the limit @xmath42 on schottky surfaces .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : num ] we will compare the results with numerical calculations and we will observe that the resonances in the low - frequency regime are already surprisingly well described by @xmath38 for relatively small values of @xmath26 ( @xmath43 ) which illustrates the practical value of theorem  [ thm : location_res ] .    _ acknowledgements : _ i am grateful to frdric faure who proposed to study these geometric limits and motivated me to start this work . the discussions with him were a constant source of inspiration throughout this work .",
    "i am also thankful to david borthwick and pablo ramacher for helpful discussions and corrections of an early stage of this article .",

    "all hyperbolic surfaces can be written as a quotient of the hyperbolic half plane @xmath58 by a discrete subgroup of its orientation preserving isometry group @xmath59",
    ". we will be particularly interested in schottky surfaces which are quotients by certain freely generated groups , called schottky groups .",

    "a _ schottky group _ is then the free group generated by @xmath68 .    with this definition schottky surfaces",
    "are always surfaces of infinite volume without cusps and with a finite number of funnels .",
    "the simplest nontrivial example of schottky surfaces are those surfaces with three funnels of genus zero ( see upper part or figure  [ fig : poinc_bowen_series ] ) . given three positive real numbers @xmath19 a schottky group of such a surface is freely generated by the two hyperbolic elements @xmath69 where the parameter @xmath70 is chosen such that @xmath71 .",
    "we write @xmath72 the parameters @xmath19 coincide with the lengths of the three primitive closed geodesics around the three funnels of the surface @xmath20 ( see the geodesics @xmath73 and @xmath74 in figure  [ fig : poinc_bowen_series ] ) and parametrize uniquely all hyperbolic surfaces of this type .",
    "they are also called fenchel - nielsen coordinates because they are global coordinates on the teichmller space for 3-funneled surfaces of genus zero , i.e.the space of all isometry classes of hyperbolic metrics on this surface ( cf .",
    "* section 13.3 ) ) .",
    "the spectral properties of a general schottky surface @xmath7 are described by the positive laplacian @xmath1 .",

    "the @xmath75-spectrum thus is not a good spectral quantity and it is well known that instead one has to study the resonances of the laplace operator .",
    "these resonances can be defined by the meromorphic continuation of the resolvent which has been shown by mazzeo - melrose @xcite and guillope - zworski @xcite    the resolvent @xmath78 which is defined for @xmath79 and @xmath80 extends to a meromorphic family of operators @xmath81 with poles of finite rank .    by this meromorphic continuation",
    "we can define the set of resonances as @xmath82 surfaces with constant negative curvature have the remarkable property that their resonance spectrum is related to the zeros of their selberg zeta function which we introduce now . if @xmath45 is a closed geodesic on a hyperbolic surface surface @xmath7 we can create longer closed geodesics by simply repeating it .",

    "the result of patterson - perry @xcite which was later generalized to surfaces with cusps by borthwick - judge - perry @xcite ( see also bunke - olbrich @xcite ) relates the resonances to the zeros of the selberg zeta function .",
