    "the standard theoretical framework for superconductivity is known as bcs - eliashberg theory,@xcite and , as catalogued in the cited reviews , accurately describes many experimentally known properties of the so - called conventional superconductors , like pb .",
    "bcs theory itself is almost universal , and confirmation of this theory , achieved with unprecedented accuracy for weak coupling superconductors like aluminium , serves to vindicate the``pairing formalism '' , utilized to construct bcs theory , but does little to confirm the mechanism.@xcite    the mechanism for pairing in conventional superconductors is believed to be virtual phonon exchange , in complete analogy to the virtual photon exchange which is responsible for the direct coulomb interaction between two charged particles .",
    "the primary evidence for this belief comes from a comparison of tunnelling data with the _ deviations _ from bcs theory captured in eliashberg theory , and again , a considerable body of evidence that confirms the virtual phonon exchange mechanism for pairing is described in refs . [ ] .    at a more microscopic level , for the past several decades",
    "the holstein model@xcite has served as the chief paradigm to describe electron - phonon interactions in solids . in part",
    "this paradigm choice has been driven by the physics , and the realization that in the single polaron problem the interaction can be very local and the ( optical ) phonons are well - described by einstein oscillators .",
    "in addition , however , computational techniques for understanding the properties of a polaron have evolved in a manner conducive to lattice models with local interactions ; this has led to an abundance of studies of the properties of this particular model . many of these properties are at odds with the eliashberg description ; early work@xcite using quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods suggested a dominance of charge ordering phenomena in lieu of superconductivity , while more recent work relying on hybrid migdal - eliashberg and dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite provided some reconciliation , though the competitive charge - ordered phase was not included . in any event a programme that begins with a complete understanding of the basic building block for the many - body state , i.e. of the properties of a single electron coupled to phonons , has been at odds with the migdal description , insofar as strongly polaronic properties ensue , even with modest electron - phonon coupling,@xcite particularly when the phonon frequency is small compared to the electronic bandwidth.@xcite    alongside these developments the frhlich model@xcite for electron - phonon interactions describes a screened but long - range interaction between an electron and the ( positively charged ) ions in a crystal .",
    "in fact , it is for this model that much of the early analytical work on the polaron was done.@xcite this model has only one energy scale , the phonon frequency , which makes a comparison with the holstein model , for example , difficult . in the holstein model and other lattice models like it , there are two energy scales , one corresponding to the phonon frequency and the other corresponding to the ( bare ) electron bandwidth .",
    "polaronic effects depend significantly on the ratio of these two energy scales , @xmath0 , sometimes known as the adiabatic ratio . here",
    ", @xmath1 is the bare electron hopping amplitude . until recently,@xcite",
    "much of the work done on microscopic models uses an adiabatic ratio close to unity ; the more physical regime , and the one required by the migdal approximation when many electrons are considered , is @xmath2 .    in an effort to draw comparisons between the short - range holstein model and the longer - range frhlich model , alexandrov and kornilovitch@xcite",
    "defined a frhlich polaron problem on a discrete lattice .",
    "they examined the behaviour of the effective mass as a function of coupling strength , primarily on one and two dimensional lattices .",
    "they concluded that with extended range interactions the effective mass can be much smaller than for the holstein polaron .",
    "thus , a microscopic model with long - range electron - phonon interactions is a possible means of reconciling exact single electron `` building - block '' calculations with the migdal approximation that underlies the eliashberg theory of electron - phonon - mediated superconductivity .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the single electron longer - range interaction studies were carried out with an adiabatic ratio of order unity . here",
    "we wish to re - examine this problem with more physical values of the adiabatic ratio , and extend their calculations@xcite to three dimensions .",
    "we find that while their conclusion that the effective mass can be much smaller than for the holstein model is correct , this statement applies for a very restrictive range of the coupling strength .",
    "we also note that the behaviour in two dimensions is not representative of what occurs in either one or three dimensions .",
    "in fact , even in the perturbative regime , low order perturbation theory is not very accurate .",
    "their initial conclusions are actually more representative for the three dimensional case .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , following ref .",
    "[ ] , we define the model , and we outline the method of solution .",
    "we have exact results for all our calculations , based on refinements of the method introduced by bona et al.@xcite this controlled method of solution becomes somewhat more difficult for three dimensions , but we present converged results for phonon frequencies as low as @xmath3 .",
    "considering that this is achieved in three dimensions , where the electronic bandwidth is @xmath4 , this phonon energy scale represents @xmath5% of the electronic bandwidth .",
    "results are first presented in two dimensions .",
    "we first re - assess some older results,@xcite and note that , even for the standard holstein model , perturbative calculations , either in weak or strong coupling , are actually not very accurate . in weak coupling for example ,",
    "multi - phonon excitations lead to a significantly enhanced effective mass .",
    "this phenomenon is amplified when longer range interactions are included , so in fact we find the conclusions of ref .",
    "[ ] somewhat misleading .",
    "the effective mass does decrease due to longer range interactions in the strong coupling regime , but in two dimensions , the resulting effective mass is still much too high to be relevant for normal ( i.e. non - polaronic ) metals .",
    "the following section treats the three dimensional case , where we find in fact that a lower effective mass , _ to realistic values _ ,",
    "is indeed achieved by including longer range interactions .",
    "however , even here the range of coupling strengths over which this is achieved is very narrow ; in terms of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath6 ( to be defined below ) , this range is very close to unity , and not in the range associated with so - called eliashberg strong coupling superconductors .",
    "we conclude with a summary .",
    "the lattice frhlich ( `` extended holstein '' ) model is defined as@xcite @xmath7 \\nonumber \\\\ & - & g \\omega_e \\sum_{\\langle \\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j } \\rangle }   f ( \\mathbf{j } ) n_{\\mathbf{i } }   ( a_{\\mathbf{i}+\\mathbf{j } } + a_{\\mathbf{i}+\\mathbf{j}}^{\\dagger } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\omega_e \\sum_i a^{\\dagger}_i a_i , \\label{ham1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the range of the interaction is given by @xmath8 in eq .",

    "the other symbols are defined as follows : @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site i , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) creates ( annihilates ) a phonon at site i. the electron number operator is given by @xmath19 , and the spin index has been suppressed since we are dealing with only one electron .",
    "note that the sum over @xmath20 in the electron hopping part of the hamiltonian is over nearest - neighbour sites on the positive side only , to avoid double counting , whereas the sum over @xmath13 in the interaction term in principle includes the on - site term ( @xmath21 along with neighbouring sites in _ all _ directions . in practice , following ref .",
    "[ ] we will terminate the sum at nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "we will use eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) for all dimensions . in reality",
    "this form is motivated by the three dimensional case , where the long range interaction follows a @xmath22 decay . at short distances",
    "a potential divergence is cutoff by the constant ` 1 ' in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ range ] ) ; this corresponds to a characteristic decay length of the lattice spacing , and in principle this can be varied as well . here , for simplicity",
    ", we keep the constant fixed at unity . this hamiltonian contains a dimensionless coupling constant , namely @xmath23 , which becomes most important in the strong coupling regime . in practice",
    "we also define another dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath6 , which becomes important in the weak coupling regime .    specifically for the coupling of the electron to the phonons at the same site we use , following li et al.,@xcite @xmath24 in one and three dimensions , where @xmath25 is the bare electron bandwidth , @xmath26 in 1d and @xmath27 in 3d for the tight binding model on a linear or cubic lattice with nearest neighbour hopping , respectively . in two dimensions we use a definition where the electron density of states at the bottom of the bare band is used [ @xmath28 instead of the average value of the density of states across the entire band [ @xmath29 , so @xmath30 . for the holstein model",
    "the entire coupling would be that of the on - site coupling .    to define the coupling strength for the extended model , @xmath31 , we follow the definitions of alexandrov and kornilovitch,@xcite with the total coupling being the sum of the couplings to the different sites . for example , in two dimensions we obtain the on - site contribution along with four equally weighted nearest neighbour contributions , reduced by @xmath32 ^ 2 = 1/8 $ ] compared to the on - site value : @xmath33    the single polaron problem is solved here with the variational exact diagonalization method described in bona et al@xcite with the same refinements for low frequency calculations as developed by li et al.@xcite the modifications required for the extended model fit nicely into this computational framework , with the cost of a denser hamiltonian matrix , and a hilbert space that grows faster with each application of hamiltonian , compared to similar calculations for the standard ( i.e. on - site ) holstein model .",
    "this rapid growth makes it difficult to converge results using an extended version of the adaptive method of li et al .",
    "we therefore further refined the method by producing a list of the most important basis states for each point in parameter space . starting with a list of basis states from a nearby parameter point",
    "previously diagonalized , or a truncated coherent state from the strong coupling lang - firsov solution@xcite we diagonalized the hamiltonian in this basis .",
    "these basis states in turn were ranked according to the magnitude of their contribution to the ground state , and the top @xmath34 contributions were kept .",
    "we then acted on these @xmath34 states with the hamiltonian to produce more basis states and diagonalized the hamiltonian in this new space .",
    "the resulting eigenvector was then sorted , the top @xmath34 contributions were kept , and the process repeated . once this procedure converged , we sorted one last time , and kept the top @xmath35 states ( @xmath36 ) and did the final diagonalization . while this was a time - consuming calculation , it allowed for much better results with a finite amount of computer memory since it selected out the basis states that were the most important for describing the ground state .",
    "one limit of this method should reduce to weak coupling 2nd order perturbation theory . using straightforward rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory in 2d with on - site and nearest - neighbour interactions only results in a second - order correction to the ground state energy , @xmath37 where @xmath38 $ ] is the bare energy for the nearest - neighbour tight - binding model .",
    "this expression can be evaluated in terms of complete elliptic integrals  for example [ @xmath39 , @xmath40 -4\\pi f_1 { 1 + 2zf_1 \\over 1 + 4f^2_1 } \\biggr\\ } , \\label{rs_per_anal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 , but for most of our perturbation results we have simply evaluated the effective mass numerically .",
    "results are shown for the effective mass in the @xmath42 direction although of course there is a @xmath43 symmetry .",
    "vs. coupling strength @xmath31 , using perturbation theory for both the extended and standard holstein models ; these are compared with results from exact diagonalization , we have used @xmath44 .",

    "the perturbative regime for the 2d holstein model is actually very small .",
    "while the ground state energy from perturbation theory matches the exact ground state energy well , the wavefunction and effective mass do not , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : meff_is_bad_preturbative_2d ] .",
    "perturbation theory does not work very well because the wavefunction , even at weak coupling , needs to include states with multiple phonons , _ especially _ when the phonon frequency is small compared to the electron hopping parameter , @xmath1 .",
    "even for the standard holstein model , restricting our exact diagonalizations to a subspace with a limited number of phonons gives quantitatively inaccurate results for the effective mass , even if the energy was not strongly affected , as illustrated in fig .",

    "again , 2nd order perturbation theory includes at most a single phonon .",
    "@xmath44,width=336,height=336 ]    a second point we wish to make concerning the standard model is that , contrary to what the ( fairly accurate ) results for the ground state energy might imply , the strong coupling solution is not simply the single lang - firsov coherent state : @xmath45 we have done an exact calculation and compare the resulting exact wavefunction to the lang - firsov coherent state in fig .",
    "[ poisson ] .",
    "the exact solution has a large coherent state component which has a peak somewhat shifted from the lang - firsov coherent state .",
    "the really important difference is the contribution of states with phonons that are not on the same site as the electron . while these states do not have a large probability in the overall wavefunction , they are important for calculating an accurate effective mass .",
    "these states increase the size of the phonon cloud so that neighboring sites are `` more prepared '' to receive the electron and thus lower the overall effective mass . using only the lang - firsov coherent state",
    "gives an effective mass that is too high by orders of magnitude .",
    "the same principle reduces the effective mass in the extended model ; a nearest neighbour coupling produces phonons on the neighbouring sites , preparing them to receive the electron and lowering the effective mass .    as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ poisson ] the crucial addition of extended phonons can be grouped with great precision into multiple coherent states , and coherent states modified with a few other phonons .",
    "so , in general , the wave function could be expanded into multiple coherent components : @xmath46 where @xmath20 designates neighbouring sites in all directions .",
    "based on how orderly fig .",
    "[ poisson ] looks one could imagine using a variational approach with these coherent states as well . for this paper , however , we kept with the simple bloch states which though far more numerous are easier to handle as they are guaranteed to be orthogonal : @xmath47 where the @xmath48 are orthonormal product states consisting of and an electron at site @xmath49 and phonons at sites @xmath50 .",

    "the legend shows the distribution of phonons around the electrons for each ` coherent state ' , while the lang - firsov wavefunction only has phonons on the same site as the electron .",
    "lines are a guide to the eye only.,width=355,height=355 ]    the main message of this is that while the standard holstein model may be the simplest polaron model , it s solution is still a fairly complicated many body wavefunction , even in the weak and strong coupling limits . without accurate characterization of this wavefunction it may still be possible to calculate some expectation values , like the ground state energy , accurately , but others , such as the effective mass , need a more precise wavefunction . when measuring expectation values with any numerical method , it is important to converge these values on their own as they may need a much larger basis space than , for example , the ground state energy , to be accurately described .",
    "the first qualitative difference found between the extended and on - site holstein models is at weak coupling . in the standard model",
    ", we find a very slight increase of the effective mass with increasing phonon frequency ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : meffvsomega_23d ] ) , while in the extended model , we find the opposite ; the effective mass decreases as a function of increasing frequency .",
    "note that the analytical result for the effective mass in the adiabatic limit is obtained from perturbation theory , and not from the semi - classical adiabatic calculations.@xcite the adiabatic calculation reveals in weak coupling a regime in which there are _ no _ ion deformations , possibly indicating an effective mass equal to the non - interacting electron mass .",
    "this is incorrect , and perturbation theory calculations correctly yield an effective mass ratio equal to ( @xmath53 ) for the standard holstein model in two dimensions .",

    "quantitatively , the extended holstein model has a larger effective mass at weak coupling , and a smaller effective mass at strong coupling compared to the standard holstein model ( for the same phonon frequency ) .",

    "several points should be made .",
    "first , the crossover from the so - called weak to the so - called strong coupling regime for both standard and extended models is not so clear when @xmath70 , especially for the extended model .",
    "in contrast , the crossover is much better delineated for low phonon frequencies , as is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig : meff_strongcouplingloww_2d ] . the point made in ref .",
    "[ ] , that the extended model results in a lower effective mass is also clear , for @xmath6 values beyond some intermediate coupling strength . at high phonon frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meff_strongcouplinghighw_2d ] ) this means a reduction from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , for example . by any measure this reduction is significant , but somewhat irrelevant , since the effective masses involved , even after reduction , are too high to describe normal state properties .",
    "however , for more realistic ( lower ) phonon frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meff_strongcouplingloww_2d ] ) , both crossovers are sharpened as a function of coupling strength , although less so for the extended model , with the net result that a regime of effective mass reduction remains , and the reduction is enormous , but now the mass is ` lowered ' to values of @xmath73 or higher .",
    "in fact , the clear effect of extended interactions is to _ raise _ the effective mass for most of the parameter regime that is physically relevant.@xcite    to summarize this subsection , the extended holstein model is more realistic than the standard model insofar as it includes longer range interactions .",
    "this does give rise to a coupling regime where the effective mass is lowered , compared to the standard model , but we argue that lowering the effective mass ratio from @xmath74 to @xmath73 is not so relevant . instead , the clear result of increasing the range of interaction is to _ enhance _ the effective mass so that in the so - called weak coupling regime the effective mass is increased due to the longer range interactions .",
    "extended range interactions is therefore _ not _ seen as a means to lower the electron effective mass to reasonable levels in the 2d polaron problem .",
    "however , the effect of long range interactions can be different in three dimensions , and we turn to that question next .",
    "as a function of @xmath31 , with @xmath75 , to compare exact and perturbative results .",
