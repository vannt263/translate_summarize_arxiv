    "ever since the work of hofer  @xcite on the weinstein conjecture for overtwisted contact @xmath1-manifolds , it has been a recurrent theme in symplectic and contact topology that the non - compactness of certain moduli spaces of holomorphic discs translates into the existence of periodic reeb orbits . for recent work in this direction",
    "see for instance  @xcite .",
    "the inspiration for hofer s approach came from eliashberg s method of filling with holomorphic discs  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we gave a detailed discussion of that method in a moduli - theoretic framework .",
    "as had been observed by eliashberg , a filling of the @xmath0-ball @xmath2 by holomorphic discs adapted to a contactomorphism of the boundary @xmath1-sphere @xmath3 yields a simple proof of cerf s theorem that every diffeomorphism of @xmath3 extends to a diffeomorphism of  @xmath2 .    in the present paper we generalise the moduli - theoretic set - up from @xcite to a disc - filling of a symplectic cobordism that has the standard contact @xmath1-sphere @xmath4 as one convex boundary component .",
    "we then show that the corresponding moduli space of holomorphic discs is either compact , in which case the symplectic cobordism has to be the @xmath0-ball , or there is non - compactness caused by bubbling - off of holomorphic discs or breaking , in which case there have to be periodic reeb orbits in the concave boundary of the symplectic cobordism .",
    "energy estimates on the holomorphic discs give rise to estimates on the periods of these reeb orbits .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , a great number of results in @xmath0-dimensional symplectic resp .",
    "@xmath1-dimensional contact topology turn out to be a straightforward consequence of our ` ball theorem ' .",
    "these include :    * existence of periodic reeb orbits on star - shaped hypersurfaces in  @xmath5 , hypersurfaces of contact type , and overtwisted contact @xmath1-manifolds ( rabinowitz , viterbo , hofer ) . * topology of symplectic fillings of @xmath4 ( gromov , eliashberg , mcduff ) . * tightness of weakly symplectically fillable contact structures ( gromov , eliashberg ) . * non - existence of exact lagrangian surfaces in @xmath5 ( gromov ) .",
    "our methods also yield some new results on the existence of contractible periodic reeb orbits .",
    "moreover , our ball theorem allows us to define a symplectic capacity via the periods of reeb orbits on contact type hypersurfaces . a simple computation of this capacity for the @xmath0-ball and the cylinder over the @xmath6-ball leads to a proof of    * symplectic non - squeezing ( gromov ) .",
    "conversely , this capacity can be used to give estimates on the shortest reeb period .",
    "we recover some examples of frauenfelder  ginzburg  schlenk and provide additional information about the periods of contractible orbits .",
    "a precise description of the symplectic cobordisms we are considering is given in section  [ section : ball ] , which also contains the statement of the ball theorem , including a variant for symplectic cobordisms with an exact symplectic form .",
    "various corollaries of the ball theorems , including the ones we just mentioned , will be proved in section  [ section : corollaries ] .",
    "the proof of the ball theorems is given in section  [ section : proof ] , subject to a compactness result for the relevant moduli space of holomorphic discs .",
    "this compactness result is proved in section  [ section : compact ] after a brief discussion of the hofer energy in section  [ section : hofer ] .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the larger part of our compactness proof only involves classical bubbling - off analysis as in  @xcite ; the new aspect here is that we have to deal with bubbling at the boundary . for the interior bubbling - off of spheres we rely on the more sophisticated compactness results from  @xcite . in a final section",
    "we give a brief sketch how the filling with holomorphic discs can be applied to weak symplectic fillings of @xmath7 with its standard contact structure ; as in the case of @xmath3 this allows one to classify such fillings up to diffeomorphism .",
    "the set - up here is parallel to our previous paper  @xcite ; it therefore seems opportune to list some minor corrections to that paper in an appendix to the present one . as in @xcite we write @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the _ closed _ unit disc and upper half - plane , respectively . in @xcite",
    "we extend the results of the present paper to higher dimensions .",
