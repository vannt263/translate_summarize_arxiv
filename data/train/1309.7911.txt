    "recently , it has been shown that bismuth telluride ( bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ) is a topological insulator with a non - degenerate surface state@xcite forming a dirac cone at the @xmath3 point in a bulk band gap .",
    "the appearance of such a surface state is caused by the spin - orbit - induced inversion of the bulk band - gap edges .",
    "low - energy quasiparticles in a two - dimensional electron system formed by the surface - state electrons behave as massless spin - helical dirac fermions.@xcite properties of these quasiparticles depend ultimately on the dispersion of the bulk valence and conduction bands which shape the bulk band - gap edges , especially , within the band - inversion region .",
    "this fact revives the interest in a proper description of the bulk band structure of bismuth telluride.@xcite    being also a narrow gap semiconductor with properties promising for thermoelectric applications,@xcite bismuth telluride has a quite long history of experimental and theoretical band - structure investigations .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations performed during the past few decades@xcite have revealed noticeable discrepancy between theoretical ( 50 - 130 mev ) and experimental@xcite ( 150 - 220 mev ) data on the bulk band gap . from these calculations",
    ", it follows that bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has an indirect band gap with the conduction - band minimum ( cbm ) that occurs along the @xmath4z line and , therefore , has the multiplicity @xmath5 , which disagrees with the experimental finding of @xmath6.@xcite as to the valence - band maximum ( vbm ) , this extremum is located on the z@xmath7f line that belongs to the mirror @xmath8-plane of the brillouin zone ( bz ) ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , which ensures the multiplicity @xmath6 in agreement with the experimental observation.@xcite    -space plane , where the dispersion of the uppermost valence band and the lowest conduction band is treated .",

    "have made the first attempt to answer the question of whether the cbm and vbm locations reported early to be on the @xmath4z and z@xmath7f lines are true extrema . with the use of the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw )",

    "the resulting `` fundamental '' band gap was obtained to be of 61  mev , which is even farther from the aforementioned experimental data than it followed from the previous calculations . additionally , a second - highest vbm ( hereafter referred to as the extremum c ) that is 3.8  mev lower than the first one and a second - lowest cbm ( on the @xmath4z line ) , which is about 50 mev higher than the cbm , have been observed at * * k**=(0.665 , 0.586 , 0.586 ) and * * k**=(0.273 , 0.273 , 0.273 ) , respectively .        in order to improve the theoretical result on the band gap , in ref .   the calculation method of ref .   with the screened - exchange lda ( sx - lda )",

    "the calculations have revealed that the locations of the vbm and the cbm are slightly changed [ ( 0.555,0.397,0.397 ) and ( 0.646,0.549,0.549 ) , respectively ] , while the band gap runs up to 154  mev , which significantly improves the agreement with the experiment .",
    "these results give an insight to what extent the location of the band extrema and the band gap can be sensitive to an approximation to the xc functional . additionally , in ref .",
    "for the first time the effective mass parameters for the holes and the electrons in the vicinity of these `` true '' ( in the sense of the dft band structure explored over the whole mirror plane ) extrema have been calculated . as compared with the available experimental data@xcite and with the effective - mass parameters calculated for the vbm and the cbm found along @xmath4z and z@xmath7f lines , the parameters of ref .",
    "demonstrate impressive improvement .",
    "an investigation aimed at revealing the effect of crystal - structure relaxation on the extrema locations and the energy band gap has been performed in ref .   with the use of the flapw method as implemented in the fleur code@xcite within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of ref .   for the xc functional .",

    "the atomic positions have remained practically unchanged except for the position of te@xmath9 atoms ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . the band gap has grown from the unrelaxed value of 26  mev to 49  mev .",
    "the fact that such a structure optimization has practically doubled the band gap ( as well as the use of the sx - lda instead of the lda ) is an evidence for quite strong dependence of this quantity on lattice parameters . as to location of the extrema , due to the relaxation the cbm has moved from * * k**=(0.652,0.585,0.585 ) to * * k**=(0.673,0.579,0.579 ) .",

    "the second - highest vbm is located at * * k**=(0.67 , 0.58 , 0.58 ) and 11 mev lower in energy than the vbm .",

    ", one more lda study has been performed@xcite with the experimental crystal - structure data reported in ref .  .",
    "the authors of ref .   used the screened korringa - kohn - rostoker method in the atomic sphere approximation within the lda of ref .  .",
    "they have found that the band gap is of 105 mev , and the vbm location is at * * k**=(0.517 , 0.366 , 0.366 ) with @xmath6 , while the cbm is on the @xmath11 line at * * k**=(0.173 , 0.173 , 0.173 ) with @xmath5 . also , from the results presented in ref .  , one can gain insight into an effect of a compression of the lattice in the plane perpendicular to the hexagonal @xmath12 axis on the extrema locations and the band gap .",
    "the authors modeled the compression by replacing the lattice parameter @xmath13 of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 with that of sb@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "such a replacement causes a certain shift of the extrema without changing their multiplicity and an increase of the band gap up to 129 ev .    in ref .",
    ", in addition to the lda calculations the first treatment of @xmath2 corrections to the lda band structure of bismuth telluride has been done ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the authors of ref .   have shown that the @xmath2 corrections increase the band gap up to 0.17 ev .",
    "this means that , similar to the full structure optimization , these corrections have doubled the gap . in these lda+@xmath2 calculations ,",
    "the vbm and the cbm are located away from the symmetry lines [ at * * k**=(0.66 , 0.58 , 0.58 ) and at * * k**=(0.67 , 0.58 , 0.58 ) , respectively ] and have the multiplicity @xmath6 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",

    "lda+@xmath2 values of the effective - mass parameters calculated in ref .",
    "demonstrate closer agreement with the experiment in the case of the in - plane components found for the vbm .",
    "the most of the mentioned theoretical results on the `` true '' positions of the extrema and the corresponding band - gap values are shown in fig .",
    "as is clearly seen from the figure , the lda - based calculations yield quite close but different locations of the corresponding band extrema and unanimously predict an indirect band gap ( except for the case of the @xmath2 calculations of ref .  , where a direct gap is also possible due to the presence of two nearly degenerate maxima of the valence band ) .",
    "in contrast , the gga calculations of ref .   unambiguously point out that bismuth telluride possesses a direct band gap . however , its value is unexpectedly small . as to the multiplicity of the `` true '' extrema , only in ref .",
    "( not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) the cbm is on the @xmath11 line , which leads to @xmath5 that disagrees with experiment .",
    "thus , summing up all the above theoretical results , one can infer that the positions of the extrema , the respective effective - mass parameters , and the band - gap value along with its character ( direct or indirect ) vary substantially with approximations to the xc functional , method for band structure calculations , and crystal - structure parameters .",
    "experimentally , the band gap in bismuth telluride has been determined by different methods . in ref .",
    ", optical measurements have led to an indirect band gap with the zero - temperature extrapolated value of 0.16 ev .",
    "resistivity measurements done in ref .   have revealed the gap of 0.17 ev .",

    ", one can gain an information about the bulk band structure .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "arpes measurements have been done along several lines parallel to the z@xmath7u direction and lying in the mirror plane .",
    "these lines have been chosen to contain positions of the extrema as obtained within flapw - gga calculations performed with the optimized lattice parameters and atomic positions taken from ref .  .",
    "in these calculations , the vbm has been found at the same location as that obtained in ref .  .",
    "the authors of ref .   came to the conclusion that the experimentally observed vbm location is in close agreement with calculations and , as a consequence , that bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has an indirect band gap with a low - limit estimate of @xmath17 mev .    in ref .",
    ", within an arpes study of @xmath18- and @xmath19-type doped bismuth telluride it was found that the band gap is of 0.165  ev , at that arpes measurements of band dispersions along @xmath20 show a minimum of the conduction band at the @xmath3 point .",
    "this minimum is observed practically at the same energy as a bottom of a slightly blurred convex border , where the surface state `` touches '' with the conduction band , which forms an additional ( not clearly seen ) minimum ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "a precursor of such a touch is the bend of the surface - state dispersion and further `` opening up '' of the warped constant - energy contours of the surface state on the @xmath20 line ( see also ref .  ) . as to the vbm , in ref .",
    "this maximum seems to be much closer to @xmath3 on @xmath20 than it comes from ref .  .",
    "a similar situation is observed in ref .  , where the surface electronic structure of an @xmath18-type doped bi@xmath0te@xmath1 has been examined by the arpes .",
    "the photoemission intensity plot along @xmath20 and derived dispersion curves reported in this work show that the cbm is located away from @xmath3 at the parallel momentum @xmath21 @xmath22 that is slightly larger than that of the mentioned bend of the surface state .",
    "as to the vbm , it appears to be not far away from the momentum of the cbm .",
    "the cited experimental results give a quite small scatter of the band - gap values and are in favor of the indirect character of the band gap . as to the band dispersion in the vicinity of the extrema and their positions in the mirror plane of the bz , the effective - mass parameters and the multiplicity of the extrema",
    "are known form shubnikov - de haas investigations done in refs .",
    "and with @xmath18- and @xmath19-doped samples ( correspond to + 30.5 mev and -23.8 mev , respectively ) . a purposeful study of the bulk band - gap edges as , e.g. , in ref .  ,",
    "where an arpes study of bismuth - selenide band structure has been performed by probing a large fraction of * k * space on a dense grid of emission angles and photon energies , has not been done so far .    in this paper , we report a theoretical study of the dispersion of the highest valence and the lowest conduction bands in large fraction of the bz of bulk bismuth telluride . on the same footing , we consider all the aforementioned factors which can lead to changes in the extrema locations and the band - gap value .",
    "we show how the atomic positions , the approximation to the dft - xc functional , the @xmath2 many - body corrections to the dft states affect the extrema location in * k * space , the effective - mass parameters calculated for the vbm and the cbm , and the band gap .",
    "similar to ref .  , in our _ ab initio _ calculations we employ the flapw method as implemented in the fleur code@xcite within both the lda of ref .   and the gga of ref",
    ".   for the xc functional .",
    "the ground - state calculations were carried out with the use of a plane - wave cutoff of @xmath23 bohr@xmath22 , an angular momentum cutoff of @xmath24 , equal muffin - tin radii of 2.79  for bi and te , and a @xmath25 @xmath26-centered @xmath27-point sampling of the bz .",
    "the flapw basis has been extended by conventional local orbitals@xcite to treat semi - core @xmath28-states ( @xmath29 for te and @xmath30 for bi ) .",
    "the energy cutoff between core and valence states was put at -1.4 ha , what corresponds to 78 valence electron in the considered energy window in a rhombohedral bi@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "to more accurately describe high - lying unoccupied states,@xcite one local orbital per angular momentum up to @xmath31 was included for each atom . in all calculations , the fermi level was placed in the middle of the band gap .",

    "the detailed study of the convergence with respect to the number of unoccupied states@xcite has revealed that the band gap at the @xmath26 point decreases with increasing @xmath34 , and the parameters indicated above ensure the @xmath26-point band gap converged within 27 mev .",
    "a move to a denser * k*-pint grid at the fixed @xmath32 causes the decrease of the @xmath26-point gap by 21 mev .",
    "we investigate the behavior of the valence and conduction bands in the mirror plane ( or , more precisely , in the part of this plane shown in fig .",

    "a separate @xmath2 calculation was performed .",
    "on the basis of this mesh , we made a guess of the extrema locations which ware successively defined more accurately by performing @xmath2 calculations on a finer mesh in the vicinity of the guess .",
    "we consider three sets of atomic positions for bi and te atoms in the rhombohedral crystal structure [ see fig .",

    "note that , as follows form our study , the relative position of the cb extrema on energy scale can be affected even by mild temperature effect , which can change the band - gap character ( from indirect to direct ) revealed in the gga(ii)+@xmath2 case .",
    "in conclusion , on the equal footing within density functional theory we analyzed how the atomic positions and the approximation chosen for the xc functional affect bulk band - gap values , locations of valence- and conduction - band extrema in the brillouin zone , and dispersion of these bands in the vicinity of the extrema in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 .",
    "we showed that at fixed atomic positions the lda yields energy differences between the vb and cb extrema , which are systematically smaller than the gga does .",
    "for a given approximation for the xc functional , alterations of the atomic positions upon relaxing at fixed unit - cell volume lead to increasing these differences .",
    "such an increase is accompanied by a steeper dispersion along the @xmath26-z line and by enlarging the band - inversion region in the vicinity of the @xmath26 point . upon relaxing the atomic positions",
    ", the number of the valence - band extrema becomes greater owing to the appearance of a quite extensive vb maximum labeled by x. this maximum is a local one in the gga calculations , whereas in the lda calculations it plays a role of the vbm .",
    "both the gga and the lda results predict the multiplicity of the vbm and the cbm in agreement with the shubnikov - de haas measurements .",
    "the locations of the extrema in the mirror plane of the bz undergo slight changes , whether we move from the gga to the lda or use different sets of the atomic positions . on the dft level",
    ", we thus demonstrated that the examined characteristics of the electronic structure of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 are quite delicate to study with _ ab - initio _ methods .",
    "for each set of the atomic positions considered on the dft level and with different exchange - correlation functionals , we calculated many - body corrections within the one - shot @xmath2 approach .",
    "we showed that at fixed atomic positions the one - shot @xmath2 results depend on the dft reference one - particle band structure .",
    "this dependence is more strongly than in the case of bismuth selenide,@xcite what may stimulate a further study of bismuth telluride but already beyond the one - shot perturbative approach .",
    "we found that for bi@xmath0te@xmath1 the one - shot @xmath2 corrections enlarge the fundamental band gap and bring its value in close agreement with experiment in the case of the relaxed atomic positions and gga reference one - particle band structure .",
    "we have noticed that only the use of the relaxed atomic positions gives adequate @xmath2 results .",
    "for those cases , we demonstrated that in bi@xmath0te@xmath1 as in the conventional semiconductors the band - gap enlargement is mainly caused by `` moving '' the conduction band away from the valence band on the energy scale .",
    "due to the band inversion , the movement apart causes a @xmath26-band - gap reduction without inducing a crucial rearrangement of vb extrema as it occurs in , e.g. , bi@xmath0se@xmath1 , where the vbm shifts from a location in the mirror plane and far from the bz center to @xmath26 . as a consequence",
    ", we can infer that , in general , on the dft level the dispersion of the band - gap edges in bismuth telluride can be described adequately .",
    "this means that , first , in the case of bi@xmath0te@xmath1 there is no strong reason to call for a revision of experimental results which were interpreted on the basis of a dft study .",
    "second , as distinct from the conventional semiconductors , for the three - dimensional topological insulators as a class of materials one can not _ a priori _ say to what effects the @xmath2 corrections may lead .",
    "we have revealed that with the @xmath2 corrections in the relaxed cases the mentioned extremum x that appears on the dft level becomes less evident in the gga - based calculations or disappears if the lda reference one - particle band structure is used . in all the @xmath2 calculations ,",
    "the valence band is represented by the maximum with @xmath6 , which in the mirror plane is located practically at the same point as the conduction - band extremum that is the cbm in the lda - based calculations . in the gga - based calculations with the relaxed atomic positions ,",
    "this extremum is merely 12 mev higher than the global cb minimum located on the @xmath26-z line .    a comparison of the effective - mass tensor parameters calculated for the found extrema with the experimental ones revealed that in general the @xmath2 corrections bring their in better agreement ( especially , in the case of the in - plane components of the tensor ) if the gga reference one - particle band structure is used .",
    "however , the best agreement is reached for the extremum x that is not the vbm in our @xmath2 calculations .",
    "the effective - mass results have also demonstrated that the extremum lying on the @xmath26-z line can not correspond to the cbm as recognized from the shubnikov - de haas measurements .",
    "nevertheless , we stated that on the strength of all the considered electronic - structure characteristics our gga - based @xmath2 calculations performed for the relaxed atomic positions give the most adequate picture of the valence- and conduction - band profile ( including the energy gap between these bands ) in the @xmath61 direction of the two - dimensional brillouin zone , which resembles that coming from available arpes measurements .",
