    "in the seminal experiment by hanbury brown and twiss @xcite thermal light sources ( tls ) have been used to investigate photon correlations and statistical problems as the number of photons in a given time interval or time delays between successive photon counts .",
    "the experiment is widely believed to mark the beginning of quantum optics @xcite . however , since then single photon emitters or entangled photon states have been at the focus in quantum optics due to the belief that quantum optical phenomena require non - classical states .",
    "this changed at the beginning of the century when ghost imaging with pseudothermal light was experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "many quantum optical phenomena using pseudothermal light fields have been observed since @xcite , and quantum interferences have been even demonstrated with true thermal light @xcite . albeit displaying a lower visibility , the signal - to - noise ratio of pseudothermal light fields exceeds typically those of non - classcial fields by orders of magnitude .",
    "pseudo - tls have been realized in different ways .",
    "the most common method employs a single mode laser impinging on a rotating ground glass disk ( rgd ) @xcite . in this case a large number of speckles is produced due to stochastically interfering waves scattered from the granular surface of the rgd which act like many independent pointlike subsources . by rotating the disk",
    "the intensity at a given point fluctuates similarly to the intensity of a true thermal field .",
    "the advantage of such pseudo - tls is that the coherence time can be adjusted by simply varying the angular velocity of the disk .",
    "a different pseudo - tls has been developed recently using a laser beam in combination with a digital micro - mirror device @xcite . here ,",
    "random binary diffraction structures ( having kolmogorov statistics ) are imprinted onto a laser field resulting in a pseudothermal field distribution .    in this paper",
    "we present a new pseudo - tls based on coupling laser light into an optical multimode fiber .",
    "the advantages of the fiber pseudo - tls is its simplicity and low cost , a high directional emission of photons at the fiber output as well as a high flexibility , especially if the source arrangement is to be changed repeatedly .",
    "currently , there is a demand for pseudo - tls as real thermal sources display coherence times on the order of @xmath0 s and radiate polychromatic .",
    "this requires a ) very fast electronics to make interference effects visible and b ) spectral filtering what reduces the count rate @xcite . to overcome these problems",
    "one of the established pseudo - tls described above can be used or the novel fiber pseudo - tls described in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we present a simple model explaining the main features of the fiber pseudo - tls , e.g. , the speckle pattern and the photon statistics observed in the far field . in sect .",
    "3 we show experimental results of two point intensity correlations for one and two fiber pseudo - tls corroborating the anticipated outcome of the pseudo - tls . in sect .",
    "4 we present our conclusions .",
    "the standard description of a monochromatic tls is as follows @xcite : light is produced by a large number of pointlike subsources each emitting independent radiation of the same wavelength but with randomly distributed phase . as a consequence of the superposition of the fields of the many subsources a gaussian field distribution",
    "is obtained , resulting in a boltzmann law for the intensity distribution @xmath1 where @xmath2 indicates a time average over time intervals @xmath3 . here",
    ", @xmath4 is the characteristic coherence time of the tls governed by the dynamics of the phase fluctuations of the different subsources .",
    "note that for a random light source as considered here the intensity average is identical to the sample average since the system is ergodic . +    to describe our fiber pseudo - tls we model the propagation of a monochromatic beam in an optical multimode fiber in a ray picture ( fig.[fig : fiber_model ] ) .",
    "the rays propagate in the fiber due to total internal reflection at the interface fiber core / fiber cladding with refractive index ratio @xmath5 .",
    "total internal reflection occurs up to the critical angle @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , the maximal angle under which light can be coupled into or exit the fiber is given by @xmath7 with @xmath8 the numerical aperture of the fiber .    if coherent light is coupled into the fiber a speckle pattern is observed in the far field behind the fiber due to interference between the many modes sustained by the fiber and superposed behind the fiber exit . since the optical path length of each mode",
    "is determined by the actual geometry of the fiber the light in each mode upon propagation through the fiber acquires a different and random phase with respect to the other modes .",
    "the modes of the fiber thus imitate the behavior of the many subsources of a tls .",
    "the smallest size of a subsource at the fiber outlet is determined by the interference pattern produced by the two rays contrapropagating within the fiber at the critical angle @xcite , with a fringe spacing corresponding to ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fiber_model ] ) @xmath9 with @xmath10 one can estimate the number of subsources of a given mode at the fiber outlet @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the diameter of the fiber core .",
    "the total number of modes in the fiber is approximately given by @xcite @xmath13 by looking at eqs .",
    "( [ number_speckle ] ) and ( [ number_modes ] ) one can see that both quantities are of similar magnitude , i.e. , on the order of @xmath14 for the fibers used in our experiments",
    ". moreover , there are about @xmath15 mode pairs which can interfere leading to a total number of approximately @xmath16 subsources .",
    "the phases of the subsources are determined by the @xmath14 random phases of the contributing modes leading in total to a gaussian field distribution behind the fiber and the observed speckle pattern @xcite .    to derive the corresponding photon statistics we measured the intensity distribution @xmath17 in the far field behind the fiber . to this aim ,",
    "a linearly polarized hene - laser at @xmath18 nm beam was coupled into a standard step index multimode fiber with a core diameter of @xmath19 m and @xmath20 . at a distance @xmath21 cm behind the fiber a monochrome cmos camera with 8-bit pixel depth",
    "was placed to record a large number of images with different speckle patterns .",
    "since the gray values of each pixel of the camera are proportional to the impinging intensity one can obtain @xmath17 by simply producing a normalized histogram of the measured pixel intensities for all images .",
    "note that the linear polarization of the laser light is not maintained during propagation in the multimode fiber .",
    "therefore , a linear polarizer was placed in front of the cmos camera to measure @xmath17  without polarizer one would measure a different distribution , depending on the degree of polarization of the speckle field @xcite .",
    "[ fig : comp_rgd_fiber ] shows the result obtained for @xmath17 under optimal conditions .",
    "additionally the distribution @xmath22 derived from the speckle pattern of a rgd pseudo - tls is plotted .",
    "as the production of pseudothermal light by use of a rgd is well - known , a comparison of @xmath17 to @xmath22 is useful to validate the outcome for our fiber pseudo - tls . in both cases a small deviation from the perfect thermal distribution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity_distr ] ) can be seen as the measured most probable value is slightly different from zero .",
    "the deviation can be explained by the thermal noise of the cmos camera . incorporating this noise to the expected thermal distributions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity_distr ] ) leads to the black ( dashed ) curves displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_rgd_fiber ] .",
    "the curves are in excellent agreement with @xmath17 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding pure thermal statistics - obtained after deconvolving the noise of the camera from the black ( dashed ) curves - is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_rgd_fiber ] ( see red ( solid ) curves ) .",
    "the latter are in excellent agreement with the exponential behaviour of @xmath23 displayed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity_distr ] ) .",
    "our investigations show that the fiber length and the physical deformation of the fiber do not significantly influence the final result .",
    "the experiments unveal further that it is important to use the entire numerical aperture @xmath8 for the laser - fiber coupling as only in this case the maximum amount of modes are excited in the fiber .",
    "we achieved this by increasing the laser beam diameter before coupling the laser into the fiber by use of a microscope objective .",
    "further , it was found that the maximum of modes are excited not by optimizing the transmitted laser power but rather with a slight misalignment of the laser beam with respect to the fiber axis ( and thus less transmitted power ) . in this case",
    "an intensity distribution most close to the thermal distribution @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : intensity_distr ] ) is obtained .",
    "next , we investigated the equal - time two - point intensity correlations for one and two independent fiber pseudo - tls .",
    "the visibility of these functions is a further testbed for the gaussianity and the pseudothermal character of the fields generated by the fiber pseudo - tls .",
    "the equal - time second order intensity correlation function is given by @xcite @xmath24 where the positive and negative frequency parts of the electric field operator , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , take in the far field the form @xmath27^{\\dagger } = \\hat{e}^{(+)}(\\vec{r } ) = \\sum_{l=1}^{2 } e^{i k \\vec{n}\\cdot \\vec{r}_{l } } \\hat{a}_{l } \\ , .",

    "hence , constantly shaking the fibers alters the field composition in the far field behind the fibers , i.e. , a different realization of the speckle pattern is continuously obtained , just as if rotating the ground glass of a rgd pseudo - tls . due to the complex and discontinuous behavior of the field distribution when shaking the fiber ,",
    "the temporal behaviour of the fiber pseudo - tls was not investigated any further . however , for our setup it was found that the speckle pattern changes within a few milliseconds .    in order to record a large amount of different speckle patterns",

    "the experimental outcomes confirm that the fiber pseudo - tls discussed in this paper fulfill the criteria of a gaussian light source .",
    "fiber pseudo - tls have several advantages with respect to other pseudo - tls .",
    "first , they are simple and of low cost using merely a laser system in combination with a short multimode fiber .",
    "further , the light exits the pseudo - tls within the small solid angle given by the numerical aperture of the fiber .",
    "this leads to a high directionality of the emitted light and thus large intensities in the detection plane especially if compared to other pseudo - tls , e.g. , a rgd pseudo - tls which scatters light in almost all of the half space .",
    "this is of particular relevance for experiments working in the low photon counting regime .",
    "finally , the setup displays a high flexibility with respect to the positioning of the sources , e.g. , if higher order intensity correlations of several pseudo - tls are investigated @xcite . as shown in @xcite , one can use many fibers and position them rapidly anew in any desired configuration .",
    "by contrast , in @xcite the @xmath69 pseudo - tls were implemented by use of a rgd pseudo - tls followed by an @xmath69-slit mask .",
    "this setup is static , i.e. , for every new arrangement of sources one has to produce and align a novel slit mask .",
    "potential applications of fiber pseudo - tls are , e.g. , the implementation of franson interferometers @xcite or the simulation of a controlled - not gate @xcite .",
    "fiber pseudo - tls might also prove useful for tasks in quantum imaging or quantum metrology , e.g. , measurements of higher order spatial intensity correlations in irregular arrangements of pseudo - tls in 2d .",
