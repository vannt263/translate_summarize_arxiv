    "the calculation of the hydrodynamics transport coefficients for model systems is a noticeable success of molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite .",
    "the standard method to compute linear transport coefficients by molecular dynamics simulations makes use of the green - kubo formulas @xcite .",
    "based on the dissipation - fluctuation theorem , green - kubo formulas allow to compute linear transport coefficients from dynamical fluctuations of suitably defined microscopic currents at equilibrium . the green - kubo methodology can be easily implemented in a simulation of the equilibrium state and all transport coefficients can be obtained in the same calculations .    an alternative approach to the computation of transport coefficients is to mimic the appropriate non equilibrium state .",
    "this can be generally obtained by applying a suitable external force and measuring the response related to the corresponding transport coefficient .",
    "non equilibrium molecular dynamics ( nemd ) has been developed along these lines already in the early eighties .",
    "it was soon realized that some paradigms of equilibrium molecular dynamics ( emd ) had to be relaxed to mimic non equilibrium processes .",
    "in particular the use of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , a key ingredient of emd to minimize finite size effects , is often incompatible with the non equilibrium state of interest . in many interesting cases the external field acts through the boundaries , for instance a thermal gradient or a velocity gradient , and",
    "the simulation of such system can require abandoning the use of pbc in favor of less convenient boundaries .",
    "this was for instance the case of a systems under the action of a thermal gradient @xcite or in a poiseuille flow @xcite .",
    "non - periodic boundaries however require quite larger systems which had limited the early use of direct non equilibrium methods . to circumvent these limitations",
    "the so called `` synthetic '' nemd algorithms have been developed and extensively used in the exploration of non equilibrium phenomena@xcite .",
    "the general idea behind this class of algorithms is to replace the external force by an effective , pbc compatible , bulk field which , in the limit of vanishing intensity , excites the same response as the original external force . in this way the linear regime can , in principle , be explored without abandoning the use of pbc and therefore avoiding large finite size effects . in the case of",
    "fluid flows this technique requires the use of periodic but moving boundary conditions@xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that , after restoring the use of pbc , the heat produced by the external bulk field must be removed by a `` bulk '' thermostatting mechanism such as for instance a nose - hoover thermostat .",
    "we want to emphasize that the theoretical foundation of this class of algorithm is the linear response theory and their use beyond the linear regime is somewhat arbitrary . in this context",
    "the `` subtraction technique '' @xcite is a very useful tool ( at least for simple systems in which the response time is not longer than the typical lyapunov time ) to perform the vanishing perturbation limit . for almost all transport coefficients a good agreement between gk method and synthetic nemd methods",
    "has been found @xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity makes a noticeable exception . in fig .",
    "[ graf_eta_n ] we show the results of several computations of the bulk viscosity of a lennard - jones fluid close to the triple point .",
    "most of these works adopted the green - kubo method @xcite and found very similar results .",
    "only two nemd calculations have been performed so far @xcite and they both provides values of the bulk viscosity 30%-50% higher than the green - kubo values . note that finite size effects can not explain the observed discrepancies .    in the present work",
    "we reconsider the calculation of the bulk viscosity of the lennard - jones fluid close to the triple point and show that a careful application of the well know doll s synthetic algorithm provides estimates of the bulk viscosity in full agreement with the green - kubo values .",

    "[ sec : results ] we collect our results and in section [ sec : conclusions ] some concluding remarks . in the appendix",
    "we show that , in the linear regime , the synthetic perturbation for the viscosity is , as generally assumed , proportional to the velocity field produced .",
    "the bulk viscosity is one of the transport coefficients introduced in hydrodynamics@xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the fluid is described by classical fields which , in the case of a simple neutral system , are the mass , momentum and energy density fields .",
    "partial differential equations derived from the continuity equation , supplemented by the so called `` constitutive relations '' and by the local equilibrium hypothesis , provide a closed theoretical framework for the evolution of these fields .",

    "as described in the introduction , the alternative route to transport properties is to consider the system subjected to an external perturbation able to mimic the  thermodynamic force \" which excites the appropriate nonequilibrium flux inside the system . in the present case",
    "the `` thermodynamic force '' is the macroscopic velocity gradient , @xmath36 , while the corresponding flux is the deviation of the pressure from its local equilibrium value , @xmath37 - \\bar p$ ] .",
    "the bulk external force to be used in such experiments is known as `` doll s '' perturbation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the required external field .",

    "we will show that , in the linear regime , the macroscopic velocity field @xmath40 induced by this perturbation coincides with imposed external constraint @xmath41 in the long wave - lenght limit @xmath42 once we are able to induce the required hydrodynamic flux , we need a procedure to compute the average of the response on the non equilibrium ensemble .    to this aim we can exploit the `` onsager - kubo '' relation@xcite .",
    "calling @xmath43 the time evolution operator of the perturbed dynamics , the following relation holds for the non equilibrium average of the generic microscopic flux @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the adjoint of @xmath43 and @xmath47 is the ensemble distribution at the time @xmath48 .",
    "if the perturbation is switched on at time @xmath48 from an equilibrium state , @xmath49 is the equilibrium distribution and the onsager - kubo relation ( [ ons - kubo ] ) allows us to compute the required average in a rigorous way . indeed , via standard equilibrium md simulation , we can obtain a set of statistically independent configurations @xmath50 distributed according to @xmath47 . starting from those configurations we can follow the evolution of the system under the perturbed dynamics and obtain the required nonequilibrium average as the average of the evolved observable over the initial distribution according to the onsager - kubo relation .",
    "when a large perturbation is applied a thermostatting mechanism needs to be added to the equation of motion and the response can depend on it .",
    "conversely for vanishingly small perturbations the standard form of linear response theory @xcite holds and the response depends only on the applied perturbation . in this limit",
    "however an additional numerical problem is encountered .",
    "the fluctuations of the microscopic variables are quite large and dominate the response in the limit of vanishing perturbations . in simple systems , where the response time is comparable to the lyapunov time of the exponential divergence of nearby starting trajectories ,",
    "the  subtraction technique \" can be used to extract the signal out of the statistical noise @xcite . if @xmath51 is the evolution operator representing the unperturbed dynamics with @xmath52 , the average values @xmath53 and @xmath54 are equal . on the other hand ,",
    "their variances are very different : the thermal fluctuations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are highly correlated and therefore largely cancel each others .",
    "this is true for times short enough . at large times",
    "the variance of the difference estimator becomes twice the variance of the simple estimator .",
    "as mentioned above , the current associated to the bulk viscosity to be used both in the green - kubo formula or in the nemd experiments depends on the statistical ensemble chosen to conduct the experiment . in all previous equilibrium calculations , as well as in the present one , the microcanonical ensemble was chosen since the current reduces to the pressure tensor fluctuations without the need of evaluating the additional term related to the energy fluctuations .    in nemd ,",
    "the doll s perturbation for the bulk viscosity is a pure contraction or expansion of the volume so that a constant perturbation in time , @xmath57 , will correspond to an exponential contraction / expansion of the volume ( see next subsection ) , obviously an impractical way to extract the bulk viscosity coefficient .",
    "alternatives forms of @xmath12 can be an oscillating function @xmath58 and an impulsive perturbation @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the intensity of the field .",
    "the oscillating form , used in previous nemd calculations , requires thermostatting the nonequilibrium trajectory in order to reach a steady state and the extended form of the current with the energy fluctuation term must be used . on the other hand ,",
    "the impulsive perturbation acts on the system for an infinitesimal time , no thermostatting mechanism is necessary , and the dynamics after the impulse is the equilibrium dynamics for the isolated system .",
    "this fact greatly simplifies the nemd experiment and the form of the flux , eq.([eq : flux ] ) . for each initial configuration @xmath61 , the energy and the volume of the system change from their initial values @xmath62 and @xmath63 of the equilibrium system , to the time independent values @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( note that all replicas undergoes the same volume change ) . in order to obtain the appropriate flux in eq .",

    "such a perturbation excites the desired flux but also changes the thermodynamic state of the system . as a consequence ,",
    "the relevant flux depends on the conditions at which the non equilibrium experiment is conducted and , similarly , the green - kubo formula depends on the equilibrium ensemble used@xcite . at equilibrium",
    "the microcanonical ensemble should be chosen to simplify the green - kubo analysis .",
    "as for the non equilibrium experiments , two different techniques can be applied .",
    "one can apply the _ stationary _ nemd method in which the system is driver toward a stationary non equilibrium state by applying a periodic compression / expansion of the system .",
    "if the heat produced by the external field is removed by a thermostatting mechanism , the steady state can be maintained in time and the bulk viscosity can be estimated as the time average of the relevant flux divided by the perturbation strength . the other possible route is the _ dynamical _ nemd in which a set of statistically uncorrelated replicas of the equilibrium system are subjected for @xmath112 to the perturbation field and the evolution of the ensemble can be followed in time under the perturbed dynamics .",
    "the dynamical method is superior to the stationary method because not only steady state informations can be obtained but also the transient behavior can be fully characterized .",
    "moreover within the _ dynamical _ nemd , the _ subtraction technique _ can be used to perform the zero field strength limit and to extract the value of the linear transport coefficient .",
    "another advantage of the dynamical method is that one can apply an impulsive perturbation rather than a periodic one .",
    "since the system is perturbed for a very short period of time ( one step of our discrete dynamics ) we do not need to introduce a thermostatting mechanism to perform a meaningful experiment . using dynamical nemd with the subtraction technique and an impulsive form of the perturbation",
    ", we were able to explore a large range of perturbation strength and carefully study the small field regime .",
    "we have found a perfect agreement between the nemd and the green - kubo estimates of the bulk viscosity .",
    "these estimates are also in agreement with previous values obtained by the green - kubo formula for various system sizes , while they do not agree with previous nemd studies conducted by the stationary nemd method .",
    "finally , by removing the thermodynamic contribution to the viscosity , we show that the lennard - jones fluid at triple point exhibits a large linear regime , in agreement with the results for the shear viscosity@xcite .",
