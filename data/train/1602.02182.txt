    "quantum impurity problems are relevant to a range of physical phenomena in which strong electron correlations play a key role.@xcite they describe a generic class of systems comprising a few interacting degrees of freedom coupled to a continuum bath of non - interacting conduction electrons . the kondo model@xcite is the simplest exemplar , featuring a single spin-@xmath1 ` impurity ' coupled to a single spinful conduction electron channel . the basic physics can be understood within the renormalization group ( rg ) framework : the effective impurity - bath coupling grows as the temperature / energy scale is reduced .",
    "the rg flow from weak to strong coupling is characterized by the kondo temperature @xmath2 , which sets the scale for onset of strong coupling physics and the dynamical screening of the impurity spin by conduction electrons.@xcite    a detailed understanding of this problem was first obtained using wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg).@xcite the method involves discretization of the conduction electron hamiltonian , and mapping to a 1d tight - binding ` wilson chain ' .",
    "the transformation is defined so that the interacting impurity subsystem couples to one end of the non - interacting wilson chain .",
    "a special form of the discretization is used that ensures exponential decay of hopping matrix elements down the chain.@xcite this energy - scale separation justifies an rg scheme based on successive diagonalization and truncation , starting at the impurity subsystem and working down the chain . at each step , a wilson shell with @xmath3 additional local quantum degrees of freedom couples into the system , but only the lowest @xmath4 eigenstates of the enlarged state space are kept after diagonalization .",
    "this scheme ensures that the fock space of kept states does not increase exponentially with chain length , and allows the physics to be investigated at successively lower energies .    the computational costs of using nrg scale _ exponentially _ with the number of fermionic bands ( distinct flavors ) , @xmath5 , involved in the quantum impurity model .",
    "the power and applicability of nrg would be greatly improved if these numerical costs could be reduced , since _ multi - flavor _",
    "quantum impurity problems appear in a wide range of contexts .",
    "for example , iron impurities in gold are described by a spin-@xmath6 three - channel kondo model;@xcite multiple impurities separated in real - space@xcite or manipulated by stm@xcite necessitate a multi - channel description , as do magnetic nanostructures;@xcite single carbon nanotube quantum dots display entangled spin - orbital su(4 ) kondo physics,@xcite while certain nanotube double dot@xcite and multi - lead semiconductor coupled dot devices@xcite are described by generalized two - channel models ; and nanowire / superconductor heterostructures hosting lead - coupled majorana fermions give rise to effective multi - channel topological kondo models.@xcite furthermore , quantum impurity problems appear as effective local models within dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) for correlated materials .",
    "multi - orbital / band lattice models map to generalized multi - channel impurity problems,@xcite and in cluster extensions of dmft , the number of bands of the effective impurity model scales with the number of cluster sites.@xcite    there is thus much incentive to improve the efficiency of nrg when dealing with multi - flavor models .",
    "the present paper aims to make a contribution towards this goal , by offering a detailed analysis of a recently - proposed scheme of ` interleaving ' the wilson chains for different fermion flavors.@xcite having a purely methodological focus , it is based on well - studied physical models and is particularly addressed at a readership of nrg practitioners .",
    "new physical applications of inrg are left for follow - up projects .    to set the scene , we first briefly summarize why the numerical costs of nrg scale exponentially with @xmath5 . for a given conduction electron discretization , the _ accuracy _ of the calculation is controlled by the number of states _ retained _ or _ kept _ at each step of the iterative rg scheme , @xmath4 . on the other hand , the computational _ cost _ of an nrg run is controlled by the _",
    "total size _ of the hilbert space to be diagonalized at each step , @xmath7 , which is the tensor product of the space of states retained from the previous iteration ( of dimension @xmath4 ) , and the state space of a newly added wilson shell ( of dimension @xmath3 ) .",
    "the computational time for matrix    diagonalization scales as @xmath8 , while the memory required scales as @xmath9 . in wilson s",
    "original ` standard ' nrg formulation@xcite ( snrg ) , the local dimension for a system with @xmath5 distinct fermionic flavors scales exponentially in @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the state space dimension of a single flavor . for a single fermionic level",
    "it follows that @xmath13 , since it can be either occupied or unoccupied .",
    "commonly , quantum impurity models involve @xmath14 channels of _ spinful _ conduction electrons . in this case ,",
    "@xmath15 , such that @xmath16 .    in fact , as the number @xmath5 of flavors increases",
    ", the number @xmath4 of states kept at each step of an nrg calculation must also be increased to maintain the same accuracy ( i.e. ,  the same degree of numerical convergence ) .",
    "we find that for converged snrg calculations , @xmath4 scales roughly exponentially with the number of flavors , which we will indicate by writing @xmath17 .",
    "this scaling property is demonstrated explicitly in this paper .",
    "overall then , @xmath18 depends exponentially on @xmath5 through both @xmath4 and @xmath3 in snrg : @xmath19 this exponential scaling imposes severe limitations on the applicability of snrg to treat quantum impurity problems with several conduction electron channels . in practice ,",
    "unless large symmetries can be exploited , snrg can not be used for problems with more than two spinful channels .",
    "two approaches have been developed to improve the efficiency of nrg applied to multi - channel quantum impurity models .",
    "one approach exploits non - abelian symmetries if present : diagonalization of the nrg hamiltonian at each step can then be done in _ multiplet _ space rather than state space , significantly reducing the matrix sizes and hence computational cost .    from the very first snrg studies of the anderson impurity",
    "model,@xcite it was essential to exploit the su(2 ) spin symmetry so that the calculations could be performed with the limited computational resources available at that time . in ref .  ,",
    "the use of su(2 ) symmetries was incorporated into the framework of the density - matrix ( dm ) nrg,@xcite to obtain dynamical results for a symmetric two - channel model .",
    "finally , a generalized and flexible framework was pioneered in ref .  , which now allows much larger symmetries to be handled , including arbitrary non - abelian symmetries .",
    "the precise gain in computational efficiency with this scheme naturally depends on the specific model and its symmetries ; its scope of application is of course limited when symmetry - breaking perturbations ( such as a magnetic field ) are present .",
    "a second , very different strategy has recently been proposed in ref .  .",
    "this ` interleaved ' nrg ( inrg ) method , described in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec_methods ] , introduces slightly different discretization schemes for conduction bands of different electronic flavors , leading to inequivalent wilson chains ( even for flavors related by symmetries of the bare model ) . for @xmath5 electronic flavors ,",
    "the @xmath5 wilson chains are interleaved to form a single generalized wilson chain,@xcite which still has the required property of exponential energy - scale separation down the chain .",
    "the diagonalization and truncation step in inrg is then done _ separately _",
    "after addition of _ each _ electron flavor , rather than after addition of the entire ` shell ' of @xmath5 flavors , as in snrg . in practice",
    ", we specify the truncation threshold not by fixing the number of states to be kept , but by fixing a truncation energy : all states with higher energies are discarded at every step .",
    "full interleaving leads to a reduction of the local state space from @xmath20 in snrg to @xmath21 in inrg , independent of @xmath5 .",
    "however , it also raises the question as to whether the truncation energy required to reach accurate , well - converged results needs to be changed when switching from snrg to inrg .",
    "one of the main conclusions of the present paper is that it essentially does not change : an extensive comparison of inrg and snrg results , obtained using comparable discretization settings and exploiting the same symmetries for both methods , shows that results of comparable accuracy are obtained if on average the ` same ' truncation energy is used ( see sec .  [ sec : etrunc-1 ] for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "moreover , this implies that the number of states kept at a given step is the same , on average , for both methods : @xmath22 we find that @xmath23 still depends exponentially on @xmath5 , as for snrg .",
    "thus , for inrg , the computational costs are governed by @xmath24 where the first factor @xmath23 is essentially the same as that in for @xmath25 .",
    "however , the exponential dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath5 in the second factor is entirely eliminated in inrg .    as a result , when equivalent settings are used for both methods , inrg yields results of comparable accuracy as snrg at dramatically reduced numerical cost : computation times are smaller by a factor of order @xmath26 , and the required storage resources are smaller by a factor of order @xmath27 .",
    "although @xmath3 is smaller in inrg than snrg , an additional minor cost is incurred in inrg because the interleaved wilson chain is @xmath5 times longer than the standard wilson chain ( resulting in an additional _ linear _ increase in overall computation time with @xmath5 ) .",
    "furthermore , fine tuning of bare parameters is also necessary for effective restoration of broken symmetries in cases where flavor symmetry - breaking is a relevant perturbation , requiring multiple inrg runs ( the exponentially rapid convergence in the number of runs is discussed in sec .  [ sec_tuning ] ) .",
    "the conclusions summarized above are established in this paper by a direct comparison of inrg and snrg for several symmetric quantum impurity problems ( specified in sec .",
    "[ sec_models ] ) with @xmath28 and @xmath29 spinful conduction electron channels . within inrg",
    ", we explore different ways of interleaving the electronic flavors , and exploit all symmetries that remain after interleaving . for each such inrg calculation",
    ", we perform a corresponding snrg calculation using the same symmetries , a comparable discretization choice , and the same average truncation energies ",
    "i.e.  we adopt ` equivalent settings ' .",
    "moreover , for each model , we also perform a set of benchmark calculations exploiting the _ full _ symmetries of the bare model , serving as an absolute reference .",
    "our inrg - snrg comparison for equivalent settings focuses particularly on comparing their _ efficiency _ ( sec .",
    "[ sec_results_efficiency ] ) and their _ accuracy _ ( sec .  [ sec_results_accuracy ] ) .",
    "we determine efficiency by tracking representative cpu times .",
    "we gauge accuracy in two ways : ( i ) deviations of numerically computed physical quantities from certain exact results yield an absolute measure of the accuracy of both methods ; ( ii ) the discarded weight@xcite estimates the degree of numerical convergence of a given nrg run ( see also sec .  [",
    "sec : discweight ] ) .",
    "it may be surprising at first that the accuracy of inrg and snrg are equivalent when using equivalent settings , since inrg involves significantly more truncation steps .",
    "this result can , however , be rationalized by noting that the truncation at each step of inrg is less severe than in snrg ( fewer states are discarded at any given step ) , producing a more fine - grained rg description .",
    "for equivalent settings , inrg clearly outperforms snrg in terms of efficiency because the state space diagonalized at each step is much smaller in inrg .",
    "in fact , for the high - symmetry multiband models studied here , inrg is absolutely competitive even when compared to snrg calculations that exploit the _ full _ symmetry of the model .",
    "this finding greatly increases the scope of possibilities available for nrg treatments of multiband impurity models . for models with high symmetries , _ both _ snrg and inrg can be highly efficient methods .",
    "in such cases , inrg is a viable and technically simple alternative to snrg . for models having lower symmetries ( for example",
    ", when a magnetic field is applied , particle - hole symmetry is broken , or other channel anisotropies are present ) , inrg has a clear advantage over snrg .    in a pure renormalization group ( rg ) sense , the artificial symmetry breaking , of course , is clearly also visible in the resulting energy flow diagrams derived from finite - size spectra.@xcite there , a full rg step , which in snrg requires two iterations ( e.g. ,  to get from one even site to the next even site ) , now requires @xmath30 inrg steps . nevertheless , aside from possible",
    "fine tuning as discussed in sec .",

    "its key idea is to modify the discretization scheme in such a way that energy - scale separation is achieved between all subsites associated with the same supersite , as well as between different supersites .",

    "correspondingly , the characteristic energy scale for subsite @xmath84 of the interleaved wilson chain is now @xmath94 where the requirement @xmath95 ( which follows from @xmath92 ) fixes the prefactor as @xmath96 .",

[ the only exception is seen in panel ( m ) , for @xmath275 and @xmath209 , where the discarded weight differences between snrg ( green circles ) and inrg ( orange circles ) are apparently somewhat larger .",

    "the reason for this is that the spectrum of _ rescaled _ eigenenergies in nrg shows a @xmath68 dependence for higher energies : while rescaling is designed to ensure that the low - energy regime ( dominated by single - particle excitations ) of the rescaled eigenspectrum is almost @xmath68-independent , it stretches apart the high - energy regime ( dominated by many - particle excitations ) .",

    "these phases can be distinguished by physical observables , e.g. ,  the @xmath247 matrix for channel @xmath303 , since @xmath304 and @xmath305 when @xmath306 . in practice ,",
    "a simpler and more direct way to distinguish the two phases involves comparing their nrg fixed point energy level structures , which are indexed differently .",

    "we also find that @xmath307 converges to a specific value on increasing @xmath110 , and is essentially invariant for @xmath308 .",

    "inrg therefore constitutes a more fine - grained rg scheme , in which intermediate state - space truncations do not adversely affect convergence or accuracy .    for models that possess high intrinsic symmetries , snrg is a highly efficient tool for treating multiband quantum impurity problems , because full use can be made of the symmetries .",
    "but in models with lower symmetries , snrg quickly becomes inefficient , and in practice unusable , when more than two spinful conduction electron channels are involved .",
    "we find that inrg is much more efficient than snrg for treating a given model with equivalent settings .",
    "this is the appropriate comparison for systems where bare model flavor symmetries are already broken .",

    "the truncation pattern of snrg , when viewed from the perspective of inrg , amounts to employing the effective truncation energy @xmath314 , shown as the black dashed line : by using a high truncation threshold ( that of the previous iteration , @xmath315 ) for the first @xmath316 subsites , and then dropping to @xmath317 only for the last subsite , all states are effectively kept until the supersite is complete .",
    "viewed from this inrg perspective , the truncation energies of inrg and snrg are the same on average ( green dotted line for supersite @xmath318 ) and the areas under the red solid , black dashed , and green dotted lines are the same , provided @xmath319 and @xmath320 are related via eq .",

    "only when the supersite is complete after adding the last subsite with @xmath93 , the effective absolute trucation energy is reduced to induce the necessary truncation @xmath327 .",

    "eigenbasis @xmath333 within the kept sector , @xmath334 .",
    "hence we employ a strategy analogous to that of ref .  ,",

    "fig .  4 of ref .  ) to estimate the discarded weight .",
    "this leads to a slightly different definition of the discarded weight , as described below .    due to the energy scale separation in nrg , the diagonal weights of the reduced density matrices decrease exponentially when plotted versus their corresponding rescaled eigenenergies ( cf .  colored dots in fig .",

    "this exponential decay shows that the contribution of an nrg state with rescaled energy @xmath337 to the properties of subsequent shells decreases exponentially with @xmath337 .",
    "this justifies the strategy in nrg to keep track of these contributions only up to a threshold energy of @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , by extrapolating the exponential form to energies beyond @xmath110 , the sum of weights associated with all discarded high energy states with @xmath338 can be estimated .",
    "we therefore define the total discarded weight by the following integral ( represented by the shaded grey area in fig .",
    "[ fig_dw ] ) : @xmath339    , of a single nrg run .",
    "colored dots show the diagonal weights of the reduced density matrices in the energy eigenbasis of nrg .",

    "first , a cumulative histogram is constructed of the discrete weights @xmath276 for @xmath347 over all nrg iterations , using coarse - grained energy bins ( e.g. ,  keeping @xmath340 bins in the energy window @xmath341 $ ] ) .",
    "this histogram represents @xmath348 .",
    "a linear fit to its shape on a semi - logarithmic scale then yields @xmath278 , which in turn gives @xmath120 , via .",
    "since @xmath120 depends only on the dimensionless quantity @xmath349 , the result is independent of the choice of energy unit for @xmath110 .    by examining the decay of the discarded weight @xmath123 with increasing @xmath110 , and observing the corresponding convergence of physical quantities , we have found that calculations can be considered converged when @xmath124 .",

    "[ fig_paper_interleaved_1](j)-[fig_paper_interleaved_1](o ) ] .",
    "we note that the numerical value of this threshold is about the square - root of and thus considerably larger than that reported in ref .  , which was obtained using the alternative definition of discarded weight in terms of the eigenspectrum of reduced density matrices .",
    "an important advantage of defining the discarded weight in terms of the energy eigenbasis is that @xmath125 , evaluated at fixed @xmath110 , is rather insensitive to changing the discretization parameter @xmath68 ( we verified this explicitly over a range of @xmath68 typically used in nrg , @xmath350 ) .",
    "we found that @xmath241 generally suffices to obtain well - converged results for physical quantities .",

    "<S> although inrg weakly breaks su(@xmath0 ) channel symmetry ( if present ) , both accuracy and numerical cost are entirely competitive with snrg exploiting full symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> inrg is therefore shown to be a viable and technically simple alternative to snrg for high - symmetry models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , inrg can be used to solve a range of lower - symmetry multiband problems that are inaccessible to snrg . </S>"
