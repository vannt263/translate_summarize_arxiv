    " fashions have changed  ,  in fashion  ,  old - fashioned  are phrases frequently used in the street , on tv or in newspapers .",
    "but what fashion are we talking about ?",
    "the fashion of ideas , artistic fashion or , more prosaically , dress fashion ?",
    "when we talk about fashion , do we consider it to be the result of a creative process ( either intellectual or industrial ) , or a method of communicating a certain  way of life  which would correspond in economics to the level of information ?",
    "in this paper , fashion should be understood as the way a creative process entails new behaviour in a set of consumers , independently of the information structure .",
    "we apply the model to the clothes fashion market . every time a new outlet appears on the market , it can",
    ", under certain specific conditions , invade the market .",
    "hence , the  old  outlet can be completely dominated and disappears .",
    "each creator competes for a finite population of agents .",
    "as is the case for the movie industry or the industry of industrial design , fashion activity depends on the level of creativity of the designers .",
    "it also depends on the level of public recognition of this creativity .",
    "nike certainly shares this assumption , paying michael jordan ( a famous basket ball player in the u.s . )",
    "20 million dollars in 1992 , for endorsing nike running shoes .",
    "fashion does not improve either efficiency or the marginal utility of the consumption .",
    "clothes belong to a class of goods whose functional properties are fundamental in their consumption .",
    "it is easy to understand why i need to buy a dress , or a pair of jeans .",
    "it is harder to explain why i choose adidas shoes , or levi s jeans .",
    "moreover , it seems very difficult for an economist to explain why women ask for short skirts one year , long skirts the year after , and then short skirts again the year after that",
    ". some theoricians may talk of erratic preferences , but the desire to be in fashion could justify janssen and jager s argument @xcite that  ... in satisfying their need for identity , people may change their behaviour without changing their preferences  .    in markets in general and the fashion market in particular",
    ", people are interacting simultaneously , and constantly modifying their decisions .",
    "it is very reminisence of the way atoms interact in inert matter .",
    "galam and moscovici @xcite built a model of group decision making to describe the dynamics of competing effect in updating individual opinions .",
    "de oliveira et al @xcite give some interesting applications of physic tools to study economic and social problems has become more numerous .",
    "social interactions certainly play a major role in the understanding of fashion diffusion process . by social interactions ,  we refer to the idea that the utility or payoff an individual receives from a given action depends directly on the choices of others in that individual s reference group , as opposed to the sort of dependence which occurs through the intermediation of markets  ( brock and durlauf 1995 ) .",
    "hence , we postulate that a consumer maximises his utility when he is dressed like everybody else in his peer group .    in this paper",
    ", we consider that fashion results from the desire both to conform and to differentiate oneself from others .",
    "we also assume that products are disembodied , thus any agent can switch from one brand to another without cost . under these assumptions",
    ", we attempt to explain how , after a certain number of steps , a common unique behaviour can emerge from a finite population with heterogeneous behaviour .",
    "we believe that the structure and organisation of the market are strong factors in the diffusion of fashion .    the fashion sector has changed since the 1950s .",
    "a lot of studies show that this sector was organised into a very simple system until the 1970s ( creation , production , distribution ) .",
    "since the beginning of the1980s , the fashion sector has developed into a quite complex and destructured system , with the emergence of different levels of quality (  fashion off the peg  and  luxury off the peg  ) .",
    "the fashion industry now follows a rationale of  filire  , which implies a multiplication of brands ( with a tough policy of brand protection),and sales levels .",
    "this tough policy of brand protection actually coexists with a high level of market piracy in the design - based industry . for a long time the  legal market",
    " fought hard against this illegal market .",
    "it seems that things have recently changed : an explanation could be in terms of of social welfare .",
    "some recent analyses show how if the counterfeit industry were to disappear it would leave the place open to criminal organization , which would clearly be dangerous for the economy and for society .",
    "according to us , allowing counterfeits can have positive externalities for the main brands .",
    "a high level of piracy can be interpreted as a signal that the product is  fashionable  . in this sense , the illegal market becomes an advertising tool .",
    "the more a brand is counterfeited , the more this brand will be seen by a wide public .",
    "multiplying the levels of quality can also be interpreted as an advertising tool .",
    "the consumer side can be seen as a lattice , in which people have strong cliquishness with their peers , in hierarchic social groups .",
    "hence , the fashion market seems to be extremely hierarchical both on the demand and on the offer side .",
    "proving the existence of a dominant strategy for the creators could help to explain why some fashion goods emerge , where others fail . in what follows , we assume that the aim of a new creator is to invade the fashion market . in other terms , his product must become  the fashion  . in this paper",
    ", we compare the different strategies a brand can use to insure the widest diffusion of its product with the minimum level of investment.we wish to explain why the fashion  filire  is currently so diversified and hierarchically organised , why counterfeits can have positive externalities and why , therefore , creators must influence social interactions by appropriate strategies and facilitate the diffusion of their creation .    * in part 2 * , we focus on a market within which people are anonymous , with homogeneous characteristics.we apply the concept and techniques of real space renormalisation group from physics , in the line of ma @xcite to study the fashion diffusion process within hierarchical structures . in particular , we focus on the necessary conditions for a given brand to be sure to dress the majority of people in a society .    in previous papers , galam found that majority rule voting produces a critical threshold to total power @xcite .",
    "the value of the critical threshold to power is a function of the voting structure , namely the size of voting groups and the number of hierarchical voting levels .",
    "we find here that when producers consider consumers as simply being organised into  reference groups  the presence of counterfeits can be helpful in invading the market .",
    "this result is demonstrated in *  part 3 * where we show that in the case where consumers are anonymous , allowing counterfeits can be an efficient tool to diminish the level of investment . * in part 4 * , people are no longer anonymous .",
    "they are organised into small groups , which can be interpreted as classified social groups with heterogeneous characteristics . in this situation",
    ", people can recognise each other .",
    "we postulate that they are _ a priori _ leaders ( they  make  the fashion ) or followers .",
    "every time a follower imitates a leader , he becomes a leader himself .",
    "we show that invasive creators can avoid counterfeits and minimise their sunk costs if they can identify organised , hierarchic social groups within the society .",
    "* part 5 * deals with setting some quantitative conditions to invade a given market with an already existing set of references groups and leaders .",
    "* last part * concludes .",
    "when sufficient agents in a consumer s social network switch from one product to another , the preferences of this consumer are assumed to follow . but little is said about how this socialisation appears , although some authors as mccauley , rozin and schwartz @xcite speak about cultural transmission . in what follows ,",
    "we show how creators can generate social effects by making useful investments , then use these effects to invest less .    at the beginning of the game ,",
    "all the consumers wear a specific brand , let us say a. in the next period , a new creator b emerges and decides to invade the market . to this end , he makes classical investments such as advertising campaigns , promotions , etc .",
    "now , people can choose between two brands ( a and b ) , representing two tendencies in the fashion .",
    "we assume that each individual wants to be in fashion .",
    "reference groups can be seen as cells that will produce common social behaviour .",
    "the investment made by the new creator will be efficient if it is sufficient to allow a wide diffusion process .    at some stage , we consider all investments from both brands are stopped .",
    "there , we denote by @xmath0 the overall proportion of people wearing the b brand and @xmath1 the corresponding proportion wearing the a brand . from these initial conditions we study the internal dynamics of spreading or disappearence of the new brand b within the population .",
    "the underlying assumption is that each individual wants to be in fashion .",
    "we believe that it is not because they have erratic preferences that people will switch from one fashion good to another , but rather because the maximisation of their utility depends on their level of belongingness to a reference group . consuming the same product as their peers or friends increases this feeling of belongingness .",
    "to achieve this individual goal , we assume that each person goes through a hierarchical imitation process .",
    "each step of this process is related to a reference social group that produces common social behaviour . within this framework ,",
    "every reference group consists of the aggregation of other smaller reference groups .",
    "moreover , it is only when a local fashion is established at one reference group level that the higher reference group level becomes activated , as seen in figure ( 1 ) .",
    "each increase in the reference group size is referenced with a one time unit incrementation .",
    "= 3.4cm=3.4 cm = 3.4 cm      we start from an anonymous situation in which the in - fashion model is driven solely by a simple individual motivation to be like the majority of the people around .",
    "there exists no leader , no intrinsic advantage to one brand over the other , only the majority effect counts .",
    "we assume the population dynamics of fashion awareness to be go within a successive set of reference groups level extending to some factor r where r is an integer which counts how many persons are within the first level of reference groups . then to simplify the equations we postulate",
    "the rescaling of the reference group extension goes also by a factor r. it means people go in fashion first according to a local majority among r persons .",
    "once this step is completed , the in - fashion process goes up to include r groups of r persons each , i.e. , by majority among @xmath2 persons . and so on up to include the whole population .",
    "for instance for @xmath3 we have 100 persons by first reference group level and then it jumps to includes @xmath4 and reach @xmath5 , one million already after 3 levels .    to formalize above scheme",
    "we calculate the probabiliy @xmath6 to have one initial reference group of r persons to have a majority of people wearing the b brand starting from a whole larger population with a @xmath0 proportion of b wearing .",
    "all configurations of r persons having from r persons wearing the b brand down to m ones where @xmath7 for odd r and @xmath8 for even r add to yield a b majority .",
    "the case of equality between the numbers of a and b wearing persons is attributed to the b new brand as a tip to novelty .",
    "accordingly having @xmath0 at @xmath9 leads to @xmath6 at @xmath10 with , @xmath11 where the function @xmath12 determines the renormalized proportion of b wearing persons .",
    "more generally , starting from one reference level @xmath13 with a b proportion @xmath14 leads to the new proportion @xmath15 at level @xmath16 with , @xmath17 simultaneously the a proportion varies according to @xmath18 .      _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ for a creator who wishes to invade the market , an investment threshold exists , below which investing is useless , no matter what the amount of investment .",
    "investing more is also superfluous .",
    "the optimal strategy consists in setting the right level of investment just above the threshold to enable the full market invasion driven by the in fashion process .",

    "in this situation , the best strategy is to allow counterfeits , which will implicitly share the minimum level of investment needed to invade the whole market .",
    "therefore , allowing counterfeits can be a useful strategy when producers are facing an anonymous market , to avoid a total waste of the initial investment .",
    "for instance , considering an investment yielding some initial @xmath41 leads as seen before to zero . at constrast allowing counterfeits to yield some @xmath42 of persons wearing the counterfeits produces an effective proportion of b wearing @xmath43 such that now @xmath44 . in that case the b will invade the market thanks to the counterfeits .",
    "altough it does hold the one hundred percent of the full market it does have make a profitable investment .    in this sense , counterfeits can be considered as a diffusion vector and then , be a useful tool for lowering the threshold .    but this tool can also have dangerous effect .",
    "for example , the counterfeit producer can invade the market , creators never know exactly until where the counterfeits will invest , the presence of a high number of counterfeits can make the brand less attractive for a certain part of the population .",
    "we will now explore whether creators can use other tools to decrease the level of initial investment .",
    "we have already shown that invading a market can have a high cost , or/ and be an inefficient strategy when the threshold is not reached . in this case , creators may be tempted to allow counterfeits in order to decrease their level of investment .",
    "however such a strategy does have also a high cost . on this basis",
    "we suggest another strategic tool consisting in acting on the in - fashion frame itself .    the idea is to modify the value of the unstable threshold which is instrumental in determining the all or nothing investment to invade or disappear from a market . to shift the threshold from the @xmath26 value towards a lower value for the invader means to increase it to the in market brand .",
    "splitting the unstable threshold value into two different values implies to introduce some asymmetry to favor the new coming brand .",
    "this can be done naturaly since we already have introduced a bias in favor of the new brand .",
    "indeed we assume that given a reference group , in case of a tie , equal a and b wearing , the in fashion process leads to choose the new brand as the tip for novelty .",
    "however for large reference group sizes , the occurrence of a tie is very rare and does not have much effect on the overall dynamics . at constrast smaller reference groups will exhibit more often tie situations . therefore to implement our new strategy",
    "requires to decrease the reference size groups .",
