    "the search for new physics(np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is going on at the energy frontier in colliders such as the lhc and at the intensity frontier at high luminosity experiments . in the intensity frontier , the b factories , babar and belle , have produced an enormous quantity of data and there is still a lot of data to be analyzed from both experiments .",
    "the lhcb and belle ii will continue the search for np through precision measurements in the b quark system .",
    "there are a variety of ways in which np in b decays can be observed @xcite . in this np search",
    ", the second and third generation quarks and leptons may be quite special because they are comparatively heavier and could be relatively more sensitive to np . as an example , in certain versions of the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) the couplings of the new higgs bosons are proportional to the masses and so np effects are more pronounced for the heavier generations .",
    "moreover , the constraints on np involving , specially the third generation leptons and quarks , are somewhat weaker allowing for larger np effects @xcite .",
    "the semileptonic decays of b meson to the @xmath5 lepton is mediated by a @xmath6 boson in the sm and it is quite well understood theoretically . in many models of np this decay gets contributions from additional states like new vector bosons , leptoquarks or new scalar particles .",
    "these new states can affect the semileptonic @xmath7 and @xmath8 transitions .",
    "the exclusive decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 are important places to look for np because , being three body decays , they offer a host of observables in the angular distributions of the final state particles .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties of the sm predictions have gone down significantly in recent years because of the developments in heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) .",
    "the experimental situation has also improved a lot since the first observation of the decay @xmath10 in 2007 by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "after 2007 many improved measurements have been reported by both the babar and belle collaborations and the evidence for the decay @xmath9 has also been found @xcite .",
    "recently , the babar collaboration with their full data sample of an integrated luminosity 426 fb@xmath11 has reported the measurements of the quantities @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the light lepton @xmath14 .",
    "the sm predictions for @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xcite @xmath17 which deviate from the babar measurements by 2@xmath18 and 2.7@xmath18 respectively .",
    "the babar collaboration themselves reported a 3.4@xmath18 deviation from sm when the two measurements of eq .",
    "( [ babarnew ] ) are taken together . in this work",
    "we do not include the belle measurements in our average .",
    "these deviations could be sign of np and already certain models of np have been considered to explain the data @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculated various observables in @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays with np using an effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the lagrangian contains two quarks and two leptons scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial vector and tensor operators .",
    "considering subsets of the np operators at a time , the coefficient of these operators can be fixed from the babar measurements and then one can study the effect of these operators on the various observables . in @xcite",
    "we extended the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by providing the full angular distribution with np .",
    "in particular we focused on the cp violating observables which are the triple product ( tp ) asymmetries @xcite . in the sm",
    "these tp s vanish to a very good approximation as the decay is dominated by a single amplitude .",
    "hence , non - zero measurements of these terms are clear signs of np without any hadronic uncertainties .",
    "note , in the presence of np with complex couplings the tp s are non - zero and depend on the form factors .",
    "another probe of cp violation using the decay of the @xmath5 from @xmath9 to multipion decays was recently considered @xcite .    in this work",
    "we include tensor operators in the np effective hamiltonian and study their effects on various observables , particularly focusing on the azimuthal observables , including the triple products .",
    "tensor operators were discussed earlier for these decays in @xcite . in this work , for @xmath3 , we present the full three angle and @xmath4 angular distribution including tensor new physics operators with complex couplings .",
    "this represents the full angular distribution with the most general new physics . in our calculations we focus on the effects of the tensor operators on observables that are sensitive to the azimuthal angle @xmath19 which is the angle between the decay plane of the @xmath20 meson and the off - shell @xmath21 .",
    "the triple products are the term proportional to the @xmath22 in the angular distribution . for completeness",
    "we will also discuss other observables such as the @xmath4 differential distribution as well as the polarization and forward - backward asymmetries .",
    "finally , we note that tensor operators are often accompanied by other operators in specific np models .",
    "hence as an example of tensor operators we consider a leptoquark model that has both tensor and scalar operators .",
    "we study how the presence of the scalar operators modify the predictions of the different observables in the angular distribution .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner . in sec .",
    "2 we set up our formalism where we introduce the effective lagrangian for np with tensor operators and define the various observables in @xmath10 decays . in sec .",
    "3 we present an explicit leptoquark np model where we show how tensor operators may arise and consider a few cases . in sec .",
    "4 we present the numerical predictions which include constraints on the np couplings as well as predictions for the various observables with np in @xmath10 . finally in sec .",
