    "ion or donnan equilibria which exist in the presence of _ semipermeable _ membranes , permeable to small ions and solvent molecules , but not to large ions , have been studied quantitatively during a century  @xcite .",
    "such equilibria are of considerable importance for the theory of dialysis , as well as for the mechanism of cells and general physiology .",
    "semipermeable membranes for modern industrial applications normally represent a polymer or ceramic film ( at least several tens of micrometers thick ) with the array of nanopores or fibers  @xcite . however , there are many examples of a few nanometer thin semipermeable membranes , where the pore diameter is of the order of or larger than the membrane thickness .",
    "these are synthetic liposomes with ion channels  @xcite , stacked graphene oxide nanosheets  @xcite , multilayer shells of polyelectrolyte microcapsules  @xcite , or biological systems including viral capsids  @xcite , cell  @xcite and bacterial  @xcite membranes .",
    "since it was discovered , theories for interpreting donnan equilibria mainly focussed on the case of a single infinitesimally thin membrane  @xcite , or a single vesicle / capsule  @xcite . however",
    ", ion equilibria can play a very important role in processes involving two membranes , such as adhesion  @xcite or long - range electrostatic interactions between them  @xcite .",
    "the quantitative understanding of electrostatic interactions of thin membranes is still challenging .",
    "due to the tremendous complexity of real biological and synthetic membranes , the theory was restricted to very simple model membranes and relied on a number of assumptions and simplifications .",
    "some solutions of the poisson - boltzmann equation ( mean field theory ) are known for charged bearing ionizable groups immersed in the salt reservoirs  @xcite .",
    "the origin of a membrane charge is related to a dissociation of protons into the aqueous solutions , so that the focus of  @xcite was mainly on the role of the ionic strength and ph of the reservoir .",
    "the disjoining pressure was found to be repulsive with the essentially exponential long - range decay .",
    "later work assumed that the membrane is uncharged , and separated by a thin film of salt - free solvent from a charged wall  @xcite or another uncharged membrane  @xcite .",
    "results were not limited by calculations within the poisson - boltzmann theory , and also included the langevin dynamic simulations with explicit ions . the interaction with a wall",
    "was found to be repulsive and exponentially decaying  @xcite .",
    "however , for two interacting membranes the power - law decay of a repulsive disjoning pressure was predicted in the large gap limit  @xcite . in both cases simulations confirmed the validity of the mean - field approach for a monovalent salt reservoir .",
    "recent integral equation study of interactions of two vesicles immersed in an asymmetric electrolyte suggested that only in a case of low valency ions , interactions between vesicles are always repulsive .",
    "however , in large concentration solutions of trivalent co - ions charge correlation effects have been shown to result in short - range attractions between vesicles , so that only a long - range tail of interactions remain repulsive  @xcite .        in this paper",
    "we study the electrostatic interaction of thin semipermeable membranes separated by aqueous electrolyte solutions . in other words ,",

    "let us recall that van - der - waals forces in systems with finite membrane thickness have been studied before  @xcite . by applying this earlier analysis for a situation",
    "when the membrane thickness @xmath1 , we can evaluate the van - der - waals disjoining pressure , @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 is the hamaker constant ) , and conclude that it is of very short - range and much smaller values than expected for an electrostatic pressure .",

    "here we should like to emphasize the key difference from the earlier considered problem of a shell filled with an electrolyte solution , where the number of large ions in the confined spherical volume was fixed  @xcite .",
    "coming back to the formulation of our model , we assume that cations can not permeate through membranes , while anions ( due to entropy reasons ) can leak - out into _ outer _ ( @xmath10 ) infinite reservoirs of a solvent . as a result",

    "note that since no electrolyte is added to the solvent , and the only ions in the outer solution are the leaked - out counterions balancing exactly the excess charge in the film .",
