    "the @xmath15 transition form factors ( tffs ) are key components for the semileptonic decay @xmath16 or the rare penguin - induced flavor - changing - neutral - current decays @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "since the leptons do not participate in strong interaction , the @xmath19-meson semileptonic decays provide much clearer samples than its hadronic decays and are important for studying strong and weak interactions .",
    "those decays provide good platform for studying the @xmath14-meson light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "the qcd light - cone sum rules ( lcsr )  @xcite provides an efficient tool in making predictions for exclusive processes .",
    "this method is based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) near the light cone @xmath20 .",
    "different to the conventional svz sum rules  @xcite , the lcsr expanses the operator over its twists rather than its dimensions . within the framework of lcsr",
    ", all non - perturbative dynamics is parameterized into lcdas instead of the quark and gluon condensates . since its invention ,",
    "the lcsr has been widely adopted for studying @xmath21 light meson decays , cf.refs.@xcite .",
    "it is noted that the lcsrs for @xmath0 tffs @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are applicable for low and intermediate @xmath26 region . here",
    "@xmath27 stands for the momentum transfer between the @xmath19-meson and the @xmath14-meson .",
    "this can be compared with the applicability of high @xmath26 region for the lattice qcd  @xcite and low @xmath26 region for the pqcd  @xcite .",
    "those approaches are complementary to each other , and by combining the results derived from those approaches , one may obtain a full understanding of @xmath0 tffs in whole @xmath26 region . particularly , the lcsr provides a link between the pqcd and the lattice qcd estimations .",
    "thus , a better lcsr prediction with less uncertainties is helpful for a better understanding of those tffs . furthermore , by utilizing the lcsr predictions for @xmath0 tffs , one may inversely get interesting information on the qcd parameters such as the @xmath14-meson lcdas via a detailed comparison with the lattice qcd estimation and the experimentally known hadronic parts .    the meson s lcda , which relates to the matrix elements of the nonlocal light - ray operators sandwiched between the hadronic state and the vacuum , can exhibit all the meson s properties .",
    "it also provides underlying links between the hadronic phenomena at the small and large distances .",
    "the structures of the @xmath14-meson s lcdas are much more complex than the pseudoscalar pion or kaon lcdas .",
    "there are chiral - even or chiral - odd lcdas for the vector @xmath14-meson due to chiral - even and chiral - odd operators in the matrix elements .",
    "the @xmath14-meson has two polarization states , either longitudinal ( @xmath28 ) or transverse ( @xmath29 ) , which may correspond to different twist structures . as suggested by refs.@xcite , it is convenient to rearrange the @xmath14-meson lcdas via a parameter @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "following the idea , a classification of the twist-2 , twist-3 and twist-4 lcdas up to @xmath31-order are collected in table [ da_delta ] .       as has been shown in the body of the text",
    ", the twist-3 and twist-4 lcdas at the @xmath2-order shall provide small contributions to the lcsrs .",
    "thus , we directly adopt the expressions for those higher - twist das , i.e. @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , suggested by refs.@xcite : @xmath37 , \\\\",
