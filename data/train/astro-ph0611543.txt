    "distances of planetary nebulae continue to be quite uncertain despite the increased quality and quantity of data available in recent years . in part ,",

    "these methods may be affected by errors even when detailed models are made of each nebula .",
    "measuring trigonometric parallaxes of the central stars of planetary nebulae ( cspn ) can , in principle , provide a check on other methods for at least the nearest nebulae . until recently , however , planetary nebulae have eluded successful parallax measurements .",
    "the yale parallax catalogue @xcite lists 24 cspn with measured parallaxes , but only one ( the central star of ngc  7293 ) has an error less than 8  mas mas @xcite .",
    "below we obtain 4.6 @xmath0 0.5 mas , demonstrating the improved precision that can now be achieved .",
    "] , so these measurements are not significant .",
    "the hipparcos satellite targeted 19 cspn .",
    "unfortunately , the faintness of the stars  near hipparcos magnitude limit  caused the results to have errors larger than the @xmath01  mas typical for most hipparcos parallaxes . when combined with the small parallaxes that most of these cspn have , the results were disappointing",
    "; only four stars had an error less than 50% of the parallax @xcite .",
    "( below we remeasure one , and find a parallax smaller than the hipparcos value by @xmath1 . )",

    "naval observatory began observing some cspn for parallaxes in 1987 .",
    "initial results were reported at iau symposia 155 @xcite and 180 @xcite . continued observations now give greatly improved and expanded results that are the subject of this paper .",
    "a parallax for one cspn has been measured using the fine guidance sensors on hubble space telescope @xcite , and data are currently being obtained for three other cspn .",
    "distances using the expansion method are also being measured with hst and the vla by hajian ( 2006 ) and collaborators .",
    "one other ground - based parallax study of three pne ( gutirrez - moreno et al . 1999 ) gave results with less precision than is desirable .",
    "a few cspn have companions for which a spectroscopic distance estimate has been made @xcite .",
    "finally , spectroscopic analysis of the cspn has given distance estimates ( through determination of the gravity of the cspn ) for many nebulae @xcite , some of which are in common with this paper . in section 2",
    "we present our astrometry , photometry , and parallax results , and in section 3 we compare our results with those of other methods .",
    "the usno parallax program began using ccd detectors in 1985 .",
    "the observing and data processing techniques are described by monet et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and dahn et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . originally , the detector used was a texas instruments 800@xmath2800 ( ti800 ) ccd , and observations of nine pne were begun in 1987 using this camera . in 1992 ,",
    "a larger format tektronix 2048@xmath22048 ( tek2048 ) ccd was put into use , and , in 1995 , use of the smaller ti800 camera was discontinued . the much wider field of the tek2048 ccd ( 11 arcminutes , compared with 3 arcminutes for the ti800 ccd ) and the greater full well of the tek2048 pixels ( giving good signal - to - noise data over a greater dynamic range of bright and faint stars ) are both advantageous for parallax work ; they allow selection of better reference stars ( more stars , more distant stars , and stars with a more symmetrical distribution around the parallax star ) which is important in sparse fields .",
    "all observations have been made with a wide-@xmath3 filter .",
    "the precision of usno parallax results has improved steadily during the 20 years of using ccd detectors @xcite , owing to a combination of improved data quality control and the accumulation of large numbers of ccd frames over many nights and observing epochs .",
    "the precision of parallaxes is now better than 0.5  mas routinely , and is better than typical parallaxes from hipparcos by factors of 23 . for stars like cspn at distances of hundreds of parsecs",
    ", this improvement in precision is a crucial factor to obtain significant results for many objects .",
    "in fact , as a class , planetary nebulae are the most challenging objects observed at usno for obtaining scientifically useful results .",
    "the results of our astrometric data analysis are shown in table 1 .",
    "parallaxes determined with the ti800 ccd have a median error in the relative parallax of 0.56 mas , while parallaxes determined with the tek2048 ccd have a median error of 0.42 mas .",
    "( for three stars , observations are continuing , so the latter error is expected to drop further as more data are obtained . )",
    "three pne ( a24 , a29 , and a31 ) were begun with the ti800 camera , but satisfactory results were not obtained before use of that camera was discontinued .",
    "all three have small parallaxes where high precision is essential for useful results .",
    "two of these three have now been completed with the tek2048 camera , while the third ( a29 ) has been dropped from the program .",
    "three objects have results from both cameras , and one has a further ( but not yet final ) parallax observed with hst @xcite .",
    "these three provide a test for consistency , and provide one of the few available assessments for accuracy : for sh2 - 216 , puwe1 , and ngc  6853 results from the two cameras agree within @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively ; for ngc  6853 , the result from the ti800 and tek2048 cameras differ from hst by @xmath5 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the residuals for ngc  6853 also show a correlation with seeing that indicates a problem with the images of the central star , such as might be caused by the known faint companion star ( see notes below ) .",
    "while the problem with ngc  6853 is not presently understood for certain , overall this level of agreement between different cameras is good .",
    "a correction for the finite distances of the reference stars must be applied to convert each observed relative parallax to absolute parallax .",
    "this correction is important for pne with distances of several hundred pc , and becomes increasingly important as the error in the relative parallax drops .",
    "this correction is shown as @xmath8 in table 1 .",
    "it has been determined both from spectroscopy and photometry of the reference stars .",
    "the use of @xmath9 photometry for determining the corrections is done for all usno parallax fields , and is described by dahn et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "in addition , for the pne in this paper , spectra of many reference stars and spectral classification standard stars were taken at kitt peak national observatory ( 4-m telescope , r / c spectrograph , ccd camera , 7  resolution ) and at usno ( 1-m telescope , fiber - fed bench spectrograph , ccd camera , 8  resolution ) . from these spectra ,",
    "the strengths of 17 spectral features ( h lines , ca k , g and cn bands , mgh , mgi , na d , cai , and several fe features ) were measured and were used to determine the spectral type and luminosity class of each star and to check for any peculiarities ( e.g. binary star , metal - poor star , emission lines , etc . ) . particularly in fields at low galactic latitude , where reddening can be large and very different from star to star , the combination of spectral indices with photometric data is helpful for determining a reliable correction to absolute parallax .",
    "the combined data give an estimate of the reddening and distance of each reference star , and allow the rejection from the astrometric solutions of any nearby ( or uncertain ) reference stars .",
    "finally , 4 to 8 reference stars have been used in the final solutions for the pne observed with the ti800 camera , and from 4 to 32 stars for those observed with the tek2048 camera . note that for fields close to the galactic plane ( particularly sh2 - 216 , and to a lesser extent ngc  6853 )",
    ", reddening is large enough to make the distance of each reference star more uncertain , adding to the error in @xmath8 . for all fields ,",
    "table 1 shows that the reference stars are typically at distances of 12 kpc . at these distances",
    ", @xmath8 is fairly small and reasonably well - determined .",
    "the median error in @xmath8 ( the important quantity for this correction ) is 0.17  mas , whereas the median error in @xmath10 is 0.42  mas .",
    "therefore , for most of these pne , the error in @xmath8 contributes only a small amount to the final error in the absolute parallax .",
    "note that the use of _ faint _ reference stars is an important factor in keeping this contribution to the total error small . with _",
    "faint _ reference stars , the error in the observed relative parallax usually dominates the total error .",
    "photometry with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 filters has been obtained for the cspn in this paper and their reference stars with the usno 1-m telescope during 1994 - 2005 .",
    "standard stars @xcite were observed each night .",
    "the filters have passbands close to the standard johnson ( for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and cousins ( for @xmath13 ) passbands , and small color terms were determined and applied each night for these very blue program stars .",
    "the error of a single observation is typically 0.03 in @xmath12 and 0.03 in @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "results are shown in table 2 for the central stars .",
    "for a74 , table 2 shows the star to be notably brighter and bluer than found by ciardullo et al .",

    "nebular contamination should not be causing significant errors for our ccd photometry of these cspn with large nebulae , nor for the hst photometry .",
    "more likely these differences may be related to transforming magnitudes from the hst filter system used by ciardullo et al . to the johnson / cousins system",

    "these values by themselves are consistent with all stars being thin disk stars . however , using the new distance in table 3 , pg1034 + 001 has a tangential velocity sufficiently high that it could be a member of the thin disk or the thick disk ( see note below ) .",

    "phillips ( 2005a ) suggested that in evolved pne with low radio surface brightness ( log t@xmath47 in the range -0.5 to -4.0 ) , most central stars have @xmath48 with a range @xmath49 .",
    "there are 11 stars in table 3 within the range of t@xmath47 , and they have @xmath50 , in excellent agreement with phillips . however , the range is 4.43 ( phl932 ) to 9.43 ( hdw4 ) . of the 11 stars ,",

    "for example , we have observed eight of the 11 stars listed by terzian ( 1993 , his table 3 ) as having distances @xmath53 pc .",
    "terzian s summary of nearby planetary nebulae was writen prior to the availability of any useful parallax data .",

    "the comparison is shown in figure 1 .",
    "overall , the nearby pne are not as nearby as believed by terzian ( 1993 ) .",
    "a comparison with pottasch ( 1996 ) is shown in figure 2 , and this agreement is better .",

    "( 1992 ) ( known to give `` short '' distances ) and by van de steene & zijlstra ( 1994 ) and zhang ( 1995 ) ( both know to give `` long '' distances ) .",
    "inspection of table 4 shows that this paper gives distances that agree better with the short scale for some objects and better with the long scale for others ; overall this paper gives an intermediate distance scale .",
    "however , the scatter in these comparisons with all three sources is large . with the large scatter ,",
    "the small sample of objects in common makes quantitative comparisons uncertain .",
    "furthermore , the poor performance of these statistical distances for evolved , low surface - brightness nebulae has been noted before ( e.g. ciardullo et al .",
    "1999 ; phillips 2005a ; 2005b ) , as has the dichotomy between the short and long distance scales .",
    "unfortunately , parallax measurements are necessarily confined to nearby distances where only evolved nebulae have been found , so our sample includes none of the young , high surface - brightness nebulae for which the statistical distance procedures probably give more reliable results .",
    "therefore , a quantitative comparison between the parallax and statistical distances may be misleading when applied only to these evolved nebulae .",
    "a comparison between spectroscopic distances ( from analysis of the cspn with non - lte model atmospheres ) and distances determined by trigonometric parallax was done by napiwotzki ( 2001 ) .",
    "he showed that spectroscopic distances were greater than trigonometric distances by a factor of 1.55 , and he argued that a bias in the trigonometric distances from a combination of sample selection and a lutz & kelker ( 1973 ) bias accounted for the discrepancy . therefore , he concluded , the parallaxes corrected for his estimate of the bias supported the longer spectroscopic distance scale .",
    "is this comparison still valid ?",
    "first , napiwotzki included the parallax of the central star of phl932 from hipparcos , and this paper finds the parallax to be smaller by a factor of 2.7 .",
    "the remaining seven stars used by napiwotzki , using parallaxes from harris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , have spectroscopic distances greater by a factor of 1.4 .",
    "the new parallax values given in table 3 have not changed much , but the errors are reduced , as noted above .",
    "we can now add four stars with new parallaxes and previous spectroscopic distances @xcite .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure 3 .",
    "three stars have a spectroscopic distance smaller than the distance determined by parallax , one star has good agreement , and 11 stars have a larger spectroscopic distance .",
    "the weighted mean distance ratio , using the error estimates for both distances , has spectroscopic distances larger than trigonometric distances by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "napiwotzki ( 2001 ) used monte carlo models to estimate the bias in the parallax - based distances . a correction for the bias",
    "is significant when the parallax errors are an appreciable fraction of the parallax values , but it becomes small or insignificant when the parallax errors are reduced , as napiwotzki s figure 2 illustrates .",
    "several of the stars had small parallax errors then , and a bias correction would not have accounted for the discrepancy with spectroscopic distances .",
    "now , with parallax errors reduced , a bias correction is also reduced . as figure 3 shows , five central stars ( ngc  7293 , a31",
    ", sh2 - 216 , puwe1 , and deht5 ) have spectroscopic distances larger than the distances determined by parallax by more than @xmath39 in both errors _ and _ have small parallax errors ; the mean @xmath54 is 0.12 for these five stars .",
    "the parallax data suggest these stars may have their spectroscopic distances overestimated .",
    "an estimate for bias in the distances and absolute magnitudes derived from parallax measurements can best be made using monte carlo models like those of napiwotzki ( 2001 ) or smith ( 2003 ) , for example .",
    "in many applications , models like these can quantify the effects of the lutz - kelker bias as well as additional effects from sample selection , and they can include a non - uniform space distribution of the observed objects . however , the sample of cspn in this paper is not easily modeled because of the poorly defined criteria for selecting objects for our observing program .",
    "we have tended to include objects believed ( from literature estimates ) to be nearby , but the unreliability of these prior distance estimates has resulted in a few objects like a7 and a74 turning out to be at much greater distances than originally expected . because all our parallax results have been published , there is no selection based on minimum parallax or maximum fractional error such as often occurs when extracting a sample from a large catalog of parallax results .",
    "a faint magnitude limit is not significant , because we routinely include fainter stars in our program , so magnitude and reddening can be omitted from the model .",
    "we have rejected a few bright cspn ( where the cspn has a brighter companion ) from our program thus far , but this selection will not introduce significant bias .    as an indicator of the approximate bias in the results in table 3 ,",
    "figure 4 shows two models of a disk population of objects with a scale height of 250  pc and with parallax measurements with rms errors of 0.42  mas to match the errors in table 3 . in the models ,",
    "200,000 objects are placed with random positions , including the exponential scale height in z , in a box 3 kpc on a side with the sun at the center .",
    "( fewer objects are plotted in fig . 4 for clarity in the plot . ) the model in the top panel has parallax objects selected randomly .",
    "the reduced density of objects in the upper right corner is due to incompleteness beyond 1.5 kpc caused by the box size .",
    "the top panel shows that the bias ( a lutz - kelker - type bias , but modified by the non - uniform density of the disk distribution ) causes the parallax distances to be underestimated by 19% ( and the absolute magnitudes to be 0.38 mag too faint ) for objects with estimated parallax errors of 20% of the measured parallax .",
    "in contrast , the model in the lower panel has an added selection of likely - nearby objects , attempting to match our sample selection .",
    "objects were included in this model sample if their estimated distance was @xmath55  pc after adding a 30% rms error to the true model distance .",
    "( that is , a gaussian error was added to their true model distance to give a pseudo - distance , to mimic the rough estimated distances available from the literature for selecting objects to include in our program .",
    "then , if this pseudo - distance was @xmath55  pc , the object was included in the model sample .",
    "these parameters were chosen to give a model sample with a median measured parallax of 2.54  mas and a median relative parallax error of 17% , values that closely match the actual parallax sample in table 3 . )",
    "the lower panel shows that the bias causes the parallax distances to be underestimated by 5% ( and the absolute magnitudes to be 0.11 mag too faint ) for objects with relative parallax errors of 12% , and the bias then drops to about zero for objects with relative parallax errors of 20% . with 12 objects in table 3 having a parallax error less than 20% of the parallax , fig .",
    "4 suggests that the mean bias in their distances is probably about 5% or less .",
    "the distance of pg1034 + 001 of @xmath56  pc is greater than the previous spectroscopic determination of @xmath57  pc @xcite .",
    "this has two ramifications for the discussion about the size of the pn and the galactic orbit of the central star @xcite .",
    "first , the inner nebula with a diameter of 2 degrees has a linear diameter of 7 pc , the fainter halo with a diameter of 6x9 degrees has a diameter of 21x32 pc , and the outermost fragmentary shell has a diameter even larger .",
    "this nebula would be the largest known if it is a true pn .",
    "its large size and a difference in radial velocity between the nebula and the central star has led to debate about the origin of the nebulosity @xcite .",
    "however , some interaction with surrounding interstellar material is expected for large , old , evolved pne @xcite such as are discussed in this paper .",
    "second , the proper motion in table 1 is in good agreement with previous proper motion measurements @xcite . with the revised distance , the tangential velocity",
    "is now increased to 88 km  s@xmath41 , the galactic orbit calculated from the proper motion and radial velocity will be altered , and the conclusion drawn by rauch et al .",
    "about its origin in the thin disk may be changed .",
    "the distance of re1738 + 665 of @xmath58  pc is slightly closer than the @xmath59  pc derived spectroscopically @xcite .",
    "this distance supports the gravity ( log @xmath60 = 7.8 ) and mass ( @xmath61 ) of the central star @xcite being somewhat higher than most cspn .",
    "a relatively high mass was proposed @xcite to account for its x - ray emission discovered in the rosat survey .",
    "the emission was noted as unusual for such a hot , hydrogen - rich star , and is still unusual , despite the fact that the temperature derived now by barstow et al . for re1738 + 665 ( and for other da stars )",
    "is less extreme than considered by tweedy .",
    "the nature of phl932 is problematic in several respects .",
    "first , we find a smaller parallax than measured by hipparcos ( see sec .",
    "the larger distance given in table 3 helps resolve some of the discrepancy in log  @xmath60 for the central star between the observed gravity @xcite and the gravity deduced from the temperature and an assumed ( normal ) mass @xcite . nevertheless , the central star is a sdb star on the extended horizontal branch @xcite , requiring extreme evolution to produce a pn .",
    "demarco et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find the radial velocity is variable .",
    "one possibility is that the nebula is ionized ism @xcite , not a true pn .",
    "alternatively , the true central star may be fainter and unresolved and not yet observed  with m@xmath62 for the sdb star in table 3 , a cspn with a typical m@xmath63 could easily be hidden and only detectable at uv wavelengths .",
    "the radial velocity variations could be caused by the real cspn , or there could be a more complicated triple system .    in observing nearby stars with accurate astrometry ,",
    "it is sometimes possible to detect perturbations from an unresolved close companion with a period of the length of the observations or less , if such a companion exists .",
    "the usno parallax program has discovered a number of such companions around nearby red dwarfs and white dwarfs .",
    "no perturbations are apparent for the 16 cspn in this paper .",
    "these data rule out companions with periods less than 510 yr and with masses large enough to produce an apparent reflex motion of the central star of @xmath64  mas . in practice",
    ", early - m dwarf companions with these periods would be detected for these cspn if they were present , and late - m companions would be detected for the closest of the sample .",
    "the data do not constrain the presence of companions with lower mass , such as from low - mass l or t dwarfs or planets .",
    "parallaxes from hst are likely to reach greater precision than the usno ground - based results .",
    "however , limited hst observing time means that an extensive hst program for planetary nebulae parallaxes is unlikely to happen .",
    "therefore , dramatic improvements beyond the ground - based program described here will have to wait until sim or gaia are in use .",
    "several other pne are likely to be at distances where useful parallax measurements can be made now from the ground . as well as repeating a couple of the pne in table 3 ,",
    "it may be possible to get useful results for ngc  246 , ngc  1360 , ngc  1514 , ngc  3242 , pg0108 + 101 , a35 , a36 , lt5 , and hu2 - 1 .",
    "some of these objects may be added to our program soon .",
    "unfortunately , some of them have central stars ( or companions to the central stars ) sufficiently bright to require some change in the camera hardware in order to get higher dynamic range to reach faint reference stars .",
    "we hope other researchers will include some of these objects in their studies to compare distances determined with other methods . if other pne are of particular importance and are likely to be at a distance closer than 500 pc , please contact us to request their addition to the program .",
    "we thank the referee , dr .",
