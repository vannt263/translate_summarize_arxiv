    "in the study of stellar systems based on the `` @xmath0to@xmath1 '' approach ( where @xmath0 is the material density and @xmath1 is the associated phase  space distribution function , hereafter df ) , @xmath0 is given , and specific assumptions on the internal dynamics of the model are made ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". in some special cases inversion formulae exist and the df can be obtained in integral form or as series expansion ( see , e.g. , @xcite@xcite )",
    ". once the df of the system is derived , a non  negativity check should be performed , and in case of failure the model must be discarded as unphysical , even if it provides a satisfactory description of data .",
    "indeed , a minimal but essential requirement to be met by the df ( of each component ) of a stellar dynamical model is positivity over the accessible phase  space .",
    "this requirement ( also known as phase ",
    "space consistency ) is much weaker than the model stability , but it is stronger than the fact that the jeans equations have a physically acceptable solution .",
    "however , the difficulties inherent in the operation of recovering analytically the df prevent in general a simple consistency analysis .    fortunately , in special circumstances phase  space consistency can be investigated without an explicit recovery of the df . for example , analytical necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency of spherically symmetric multi ",
    "component systems with osipkov  merritt ( hereafter om ) anisotropy ( @xcite , @xcite ) were derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and applied in several investigations ( e.g. , @xcite@xcite ) . moreover , in @xcite we derived analytical consistency criteria for the family of spherically symmetric , multi  component generalized cuddeford @xcite systems , which contains as very special cases constant anisotropy and om systems .",
    "another necessary condition for consistency of spherical systems is given by the `` central cusp ",
    "anisotropy theorem '' by an & evans @xcite , an inequality relating the values of the _ central _ logarithmic density slope @xmath2 and of the anisotropy parameter @xmath3 of _ any _ consistent spherical system :    * theorem * in every consistent system with constant anisotropy @xmath4 necessarily @xmath5 moreover the same inequality holds asymptotically at the center of every consistent spherical system with generic anisotropy profile .    in the following we call @xmath6 @xmath7 the _ global _ density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality : therefore the an & evans theorem states that constant anisotropy systems obey to the global density slope - anisotropy inequality .",
    "however , constant anisotropy systems are quite special , and so it was a surprise when we found ( @xcite ) that the necessary condition for model consistency derived in @xcite for om anisotropic systems can be rewritten as the global density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality .",
    "in other words , the global inequality holds not only for constant anisotropy systems , but also for each component of multi  component om systems .",
    "prompted by this result , in @xcite we introduced the family of multi  component generalized cuddeford systems , a class of models containing as very special cases both the multi  component om models and the constant anisotropy systems .",
    "we studied their phase  space consistency , obtaining analytical necessary and sufficient conditions for it , and we finally proved that the global density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality is again a necessary condition for model consistency !    the results of @xcite and @xcite , here summarized , revealed the unexpected generality of the global density slope  anisotropy inequality . in absence of counter",
    " examples ( see in particular the discussions in @xcite ) it is natural to ask whether the global inequality is just a consequence of some special characteristics of the df of generalized cuddeford systems , or it is even more general , i.e. it is necessarily obeyed by all spherically symmetric two  integrals systems with positive df . here",
    "we report on two new interesting analytical cases of models , not belonging to the generalized cuddeford family , supporting the latter point of view .",
    "we also present an alternative formulation of the global density ",
    "slope anisotropy inequality .",
    "therefore , even if a proof of the general validity of the global density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality is still missing , some relevant advance has been made , and we now have the proof that entire new families of models do obey the global inequality ( see @xcite for a full discussion ) .",
    "the om prescription to obtain radially anisotropic spherical systems assumes that the associated df depends on the energy and on the angular momentum modulus of stellar orbits as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the so  called anisotropy radius ( e.g. see @xcite ) . in the formula above @xmath10",
    "is the relative energy per unit mass , @xmath11 is the relative ( total ) potential , and @xmath12 for @xmath13 . a multi  component om system is defined as the superposition of density components , each of them characterized by a df of the family  ( [ fom ] ) , but in general with different @xmath9",
    ". therefore , unless all the @xmath9 are identical , a multi  component om model is not an om system",
    ". it is easy to prove that the radial dependence of the anisotropy parameter associated to such models is @xmath14 i.e. systems are isotropic at the center and increasingly radially anisotropic with radius .",
    "consistency criteria for multi  component om models have been derived in @xcite , while in @xcite it was shown that a necessary condition for phase  space consistency of each density component can be rewritten as the global density slope - anisotropy inequality @xmath15 i.e. not only constant anisotropy systems but also multi  component om models follow the global inequality .",
    "an interesting generalization of om and constant anisotropy systems was proposed by cuddeford ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and is obtained by assuming @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a real number and @xmath18 is defined as in equation  ( [ fom ] ) .",
    "therefore , both the om models ( @xmath19 ) , and the constant anisotropy models ( @xmath20 ) , belong to the family  ( [ f ] ) .",
    "in particular , it is easy to show that from equation  ( 5 ) @xmath21 remarkably , also for these models a simple inversion formula links the df to the density profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "such inversion formula still holds for multi  component , generalized cuddeford systems , that we have introduced in @xcite .",
    "_ each _ density component of a generalized cuddeford model has a df given by the sum of an arbitrary number of cuddeford dfs with arbitrary positive weights @xmath22 and possibly different anisotropy radii @xmath23 ( but same @xmath24 function and angular momentum exponent ) , i.e. @xmath25 of course , the orbital anisotropy distribution characteristic of df  ( [ sumcud ] ) is _ not _ a cuddeford one , and quite general anisotropy profiles can be obtained by specific choices of the weights @xmath22 , the anisotropy radii @xmath23 , and the exponent @xmath26 . however , near the center @xmath27 , and @xmath28 for @xmath29 , independently of the specific values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    in @xcite , we have found necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of multi  component generalized cuddeford systems . at variance with the simpler case of om models ,",
    "the new models admit a _ family _ of necessary conditions , that can be written as simple inequalities involving repeated differentiations of the augmented density expressed as a function of the total potential .",
    "_ surprisingly , we also showed that the first of the necessary conditions for phase  space consistency can be reformulated as the global density slope  anisotropy inequality ( 4 ) _ , which therefore holds at all radii for each density component of multi  component generalized cuddeford models .",
    "the natural question posed by the analysis above is whether the global density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality is a peculiarity of multi  component generalized cuddeford models : after all , only models in this ( very large ) family have been proved to obey the global inequality .",
    "we now continue our study by showing , by direct computation , that two well - known anisotropic models , whose analytical df is available and not belonging to the generalized cuddeford family , indeed obey to the global density slope  anisotropy inequality .",
    "a full discussion of the following cases , and their place in a broader context , will be presented in @xcite .",
    "dejonghe @xcite , by using the augmented density approach , studied a family of ( one  component ) anisotropic plummer models , with normalized density ",
    "potential pair @xmath30 both the radial trend of orbital anisotropy and the model df were recovered analytically : @xmath31 where @xmath32 belongs to the family of hypergeometric functions . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the consistency requirement @xmath33 imposes the limitation @xmath34 .",
    "well , a direct computation of the logarithmic density slope of the plummer model  ( [ rhodej ] ) , together with equation  ( [ betadej ] ) , proves that these models obey to the global density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality when @xmath34 .",
    "baes & dejonghe @xcite considered a family of one  component anisotropic hernquist models whose normalized density  potential pair is @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding anisotropy parameter and df are @xmath37 so that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the anisotropy values at the center and at large radii of the system , respectively ; note that in this family of models the orbital anisotropy decreases moving away from the center . in equation  ( [ betabadej ] )",
    "@xmath40 are hypergeometric functions and , in accordance with the `` cusp slope  central anisotropy theorem '' , the request of non  negativity imposes @xmath41 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note that , as in the previous case , the df is not of the generalized cuddeford family .",
    "again a comparison of the logarithmic density slope of hernquist profile  ( [ rhobadej ] ) with equation  ( [ betabadej ] ) shows that , when @xmath36 and @xmath41 also these models obey the global inequality ( 4 ) !      while we refer the reader to @xcite for a full discussion of the new results , and for how these find place in a more general context , here",
    "we show that the density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality can also be expressed as a condition on the radial velocity dispersion .",
    "in fact , the relevant jeans equation in spherical symmetry reads @xmath42 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . introducing the logarithmic density slope and rearranging the terms",
    ", one finds @xmath43 as an equivalent , alternative formulation of the density slope ",
    "anisotropy inequality .",
    "of course , the proof that a given family of self  consistent models obeys inequality  ( [ jeansgamma ] ) is not easier than the proof that would be obtained by working on phase  space .",
    "we have shown analytically that two more models , in addition to the whole family of multi - component generalized cuddeford systems , satisfy the global density slope  anisotropy inequality as a necessary condition for phase  space consistency .",
    "this reinforces the conjecture that the global slope ",
    "anisotropy relation ( 4 ) could be a universal necessary condition for consistent spherical systems .",
    "we recall that additional evidences supporting such idea exist : for example michele trenti kindly provided us with a large set of numerically computed @xmath44 models @xcite , and all of them , without exception , satisfy the inequality @xmath45 at all radii .",
    "additional numerical findings are mentioned in @xcite .",
