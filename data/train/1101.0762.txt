    "recently , a theoretical argument was given  @xcite that relates the stripe state probability to certain exactly - calculated percolation crossing probabilities .",

    "little is known about the evolution and long - time state of this kinetic ising ferromagnet .",
    "if the initial magnetization is non - zero , it is generally believed that this system ( on an even - coordinated lattice in @xmath13 ) ultimately reaches the ground state of the majority phase in the thermodynamic limit , no matter how small the initial magnetization  @xcite .",
    "this result has not been proved , even in two dimensions , although it is plausible because of the connection with percolation  @xcite . in the @xmath14 limit ,",
    "the fact that the ( majority ) ground state is reached is intuitively obvious and has been recently proved in ref .",
    "physically , however , the zero initial - magnetization state is much more important than the general case of a non - zero magnetization .",
    "indeed , the usual coarsening process begins at a temperature that exceeds the critical temperature where the initial magnetization ( of an infinite system ) equals zero .",
    "we therefore focus on the case of zero initial magnetization in this paper .",
    "an earlier study  @xcite found that an @xmath15 ising ferromagnet on a cubic lattice exhibits a much more complex evolution than the corresponding two - dimensional system .",
    "in particular , the long - time state is typically topologically complex and not static .",

    "we offer new perspectives to help understand the long - time state of the system and present simulation results to quantify its unusual properties .",

    "there are also oppositely - oriented spins ( blank spaces ) adjacent to the apex of the concave corners that can also flip up with no energy cost .",
    "a blinker state wanders perpetually on a small set of iso - energy points in state space .",
    "blinker states first appear ( albeit rarely ) when the linear dimension @xmath16 , but essentially _ all _ configurations contain blinkers for large @xmath0 .",

    "based on the insights gained from studying blinker states , we can understand some important features of this survival probability .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "basic features of the evolution of a @xmath17 system , where all states can be enumerated exactly , as well as a few details of slightly larger systems are are presented in appendix  [ small ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the ferromagnetic ising model is @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the spin at site @xmath20 , the interaction strength is set to one , and the sum is over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites . if not stated explicitly otherwise , we consider the cubic lattice of linear dimension @xmath0 , with @xmath0 even , and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there are two natural choices for the initial state : ( i ) initially uncorrelated and equal fractions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 spins ( corresponding to an initial temperature @xmath23 ) , or ( ii ) the antiferromagnetic initial condition , in which all pairs of neighboring spins are oppositely oriented .",
    "the long - time evolutions of the system starting from these two initial states are similar , with only small quantitative differences in the distribution of basic physical observables , such as the energy and magnetization in the long - time state .",
    "thus we focus on the antiferromagnetic initial state for concreteness and for simplicity .",
    "the spins evolve by zero - temperature single spin - flip glauber dynamics  @xcite . to implement this dynamics at zero temperature , we keep a list of flippable spins",
    " those where the energy change of the system @xmath24 would be zero or negative if the spin were to flip .",
    "( at zero temperature , spin - flips which would lead to an increase of energy , @xmath25 , are forbidden @xcite . )   by picking only the spins from this list , we eliminate the time that would be wasted in picking and simulating non - flippable spins . in each update",
    ", we pick a flippable spin at random and flip it with probability 1 if @xmath26 , or with probability @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "this update corresponds to majority rule , as the condition @xmath26 means that the majority of neighbors are antiparallel to the selected spin .",
    "more generally , zero - temperature single spin - flip dynamics is defined by the rules , @xmath29 that depend on the single parameter @xmath30 . for the heat - bath and glauber dynamics , @xmath31 , while for the metropolis algorithm @xcite all updates proceed with the same rate ( @xmath32 ) . while the behavior for all @xmath33 is essentially independent of @xmath30 ,",
    "the @xmath34 case is special , as the system quickly gets trapped in a jammed configuration @xcite .",
    "we shall avoid the @xmath34 dynamics with only strictly energy - lowering spin flips , as this case is relevant for a special class of _ kinetically constrained _ systems ( see @xcite for review ) . since the choice for the parameter @xmath30 is arbitrary ( as long as @xmath30 is strictly positive ) , we fix @xmath31 , although this choice is essentially a matter of habit and , e.g. , the metropolis algorithm with @xmath32 is more efficient .    for the antiferromagnetic initial condition , all spins are initially flippable .",
    "the number of flippable spins decreases rapidly at early times and then the decrease slows down as the system coarsens . after each update event , the time is incremented by 1/#(flippable spins ) .",
    "thus in one time unit , each flippable spin changes its state once on average .",
    "this update step is applied repeatedly and the dynamics is averaged over many realizations to determine the evolution of the system .",
    "the evolution of the system becomes so slow that the standard glauber dynamics algorithm described above is inadequate to probe the long - time properties of even reasonably - sized systems .",
    "figure  [ e - single ] illustrates this slowing down for the energy evolution of a typical realization of a @xmath35 system .",
    "the main panel shows the time dependence of the gap between the actual energy and the ground state energy divided by the total number of spins . henceforth , we term this normalized difference as the `` energy '' @xmath36 . for this example , the data are roughly consistent with the @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",

    "the inset shows the long - time tail of the same data ; note that the abscissa is @xmath40.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    for times beyond the coarsening time ( which scales as @xmath9 ) , the energy evolution is characterized by long periods where only zero - energy spins can flip ( those with equal numbers of up and down neighbors ) .",
    "these long periods of stasis are punctuated by progressively more rare energy - decreasing events ( inset to fig .",
    "[ e - single ] ) .",
    "thus the system typically wanders on successive plateaux that define a set of iso - energy points in state space .",
    "occasionally there is a drop to a lower plateau by an energy - lowering spin - flip event ( fig .  [ plateau ] )",
    "this feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ t - vs - n ] , where we plot the configuration averaged time @xmath41 between successive energy - lowering spin - flip events as a function of @xmath42 , the average time at which the @xmath43 such event occurred . over a substantial range",

    "the data are smoothed over a 100-point range .",
    ", scaledwidth=35.0% ]    to reduce the time spent in simulating these iso - energy wanderings , we constructed an acceleration algorithm and tested that the long - time state achieved by this algorithm is virtually identical to that of the true zero - temperature glauber dynamics .",
    "our method is based on imposing a weak field while the system is on any single iso - energy plateau to reduce the time needed to find the next energy lowering event .",
    "the field is reversed after each such event so that the average field is zero .",
    "the steps of our method are the following :    * apply glauber dynamics ( to flippable spins only ) until @xmath46 .",
    "this time is sufficiently beyond the coarsening time that energy - lowering events have become rare ( fig .",
    "[ e - single ] ) .",
    "* for @xmath47 , apply an infinitesimal field to drive the state - space motion along a fixed - energy plateau .",
    "thus the next energy - lowering event ( if it exists ) is found more rapidly than if no field was applied . * after each energy - lowering event occurs , the sign of the field is reversed , leading to the alternating state - space motion sketched in fig .  [ plateau ] . *",
    "if the number of active spins goes to zero without a drop in energy while the field is applied , the field is reversed . from this configuration ,",
    "the system evolves by zero - temperature glauber dynamics with the reversed field .",
    "if the number of active spins again goes to zero without a drop in energy , then the final energy value has been reached and the simulation is finished .",
    "we verified that this acceleration algorithm accurately reproduces the energy obtained by straightforward glauber dynamics for @xmath48 , where a direct check of this acceleration method is computationally feasible . for this check , we take all configurations that have been evolved to @xmath49 by zero - temperature glauber dynamics and evolve each one both by continuing the glauber dynamics and by our acceleration algorithm until no flippable spins remain . over @xmath50 realizations",
    "the fractional difference between the energies obtained by these two methods is @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the distributions of the final energies are virtually indistinguishable .    for larger @xmath0 , time to reach",
    "the final energy by zero - temperature glauber dynamics is too long to amass sufficient statistics .",
    "instead , we compare the ultimate energy that is reached by starting the acceleration algorithm at progressively later times . as shown in the table  [ tab : compare ] in appendix  [ sec : accel ] , the energy that is ultimately reached changes by a negligible amount as the cutoff time is increased .",
    "for example , for @xmath52 , the error in the final energy reached by the acceleration algorithm is of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , as illustrated in this table , the acceleration algorithm is considerably faster than the zero - temperature glauber dynamics .",
    "thus we use the acceleration algorithm for all of our simulation results . on a 32-core machine ,",
    "we are able to simulate @xmath54 realizations of a @xmath55 system in approximately ten days of running time .",
    "at sufficiently long times , the energy of each realization stops decreasing , either because a blinker configuration is reached or occasionally a static final state is reached .",
    "figure  [ blinker - prob ] shows that the probability of reaching a blinker configuration approaches 1 as @xmath56 .",
    "this observation is one of our main results , for which preliminary corroboration was given earlier  @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , for the initial condition where the magnetization is zero but with otherwise uncorrelated spins , the probability to reach a stationary state vanishes more rapidly in the @xmath56 limit than for the antiferromagnetic initial condition . even though a blinker consists of a set of states of the same energy , we term the `` final state '' these constant - energy configuration(s ) that are reached when the energy stops decreasing .    ,",
    "the complement of the probability @xmath57 of reaching a blinker configuration ( @xmath58 ) , and @xmath59 , the complement of the probability @xmath60 of reaching a state that consists of 2 clusters ( @xmath61 ) , as a function of @xmath62.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in this final state , the spins almost always partition into two and only two interpenetrating clusters . using the hoshen - kopelman cluster - multilabeling algorithm  @xcite to determine the distribution of the number of clusters , we find that the probability to find a single cluster ( corresponding to the ground state ) or more than two clusters in the final state rapidly decays with @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ blinker - prob ] ) .",
    "final states that contain more than two clusters typically consist of multiple narrow filaments of one phase in a surrounding background of the opposite phase . in all of our simulations on the @xmath15 cubes with periodic boundary conditions , the largest number of clusters observed in any realization was seven .",
    "( this happened to occur in a @xmath63 system , where the realization consisted of six narrow filaments of one phase in a background of the opposite phase . )",
    "as we now discuss , blinker states are responsible for the very slow relaxation of the spin system at long times . to appreciate the underlying mechanism , it is instructive to study the dynamics of the synthetic blinker states shown in fig .",
    "[ blinker - evol ] . in this example , the domain of up spins consists of three orthogonal @xmath64 slabs , each of which wraps periodically , so that the apparent slab corners are merely visual artifacts . in the cavity defined by the confluence of the three slabs , a blinker state exists . by zero - energy spin flips , the portion of the interface defined by this cavity can be in the extremes of fully deflated ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ blinker - evol ] ) , or fully inflated ( right ) , or in some intermediate state ( middle ) .",
    "note that each extreme configuration possesses a single blinker spin , while intermediate configurations have more than one blinker spin .",
    "although each blinker spin does not experience any energetic bias , there is an effective geometric bias that drives the interface to the half - inflated state .",
    "this effective bias is controlled by the difference in the number of flippable spins on the convex and concave corners on the interface , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . when the cube is mostly inflated @xmath67 is positive so that the interface tends to deflate , and vice versa when the cube is mostly deflated .",
    "thus the effective bias drives the interface to the half - inflated state .",
    "we quantify the evolution of this synthetic blinker by the average first - passage time @xmath68 for an @xmath69 fully - deflated blinker to become fully inflated . to estimate this time , it is helpful to first consider the corresponding two - dimensional system ( fig .",

    "the interface consists of @xmath65 outer corners and @xmath66 inner corners , with @xmath70 in two dimensions and @xmath71 . in a single time unit , all eligible spins on the interface flip once , on average . since @xmath70 , the interface area typically decreases by 1 .",
    "thus we infer an interface velocity @xmath72 .",

    "fig : genus - dist ] ) .",
    "although we separately studied the energy and the genus , these two quantities can be intimately connected by simple topological considerations .",
    "we start by simplifying eq .  .",
    "for a closed surface that defines the interface between spin domains , each face has 4 edges and each edge must be shared between 2 adjacent faces .",
    "hence @xmath130 similarly , each edge has 2 vertices and each vertex is shared among 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 adjacent edges ( fig .  [ vertices ] ) .",
    "this leads to the bounds @xmath131 using these two relations in eq .",
    "gives @xmath132 while the lower bound is useful , the upper bound can be replaced by the much stronger condition @xmath133 , with the maximal value of 2 being achieved for a sphere . with this replacement ,",
    "we obtain the following bounds on the genus : @xmath134 however , @xmath115 is directly related to the total energy of the system because each face corresponds to a single pair of anti - aligned spins per spin and thus has an energy cost of @xmath135 ( when the interaction strength is set to 1 , see eq .  ) .",
    "thus @xmath136 .",
    "finally , we make the guess that the actual value of @xmath105 lies roughly midway between the upper and lower bounds ; namely , @xmath137 . using our exponent definitions @xmath138 and @xmath139",
    ", our argument leads to the exponent inequality @xmath140 our numerical estimates for these two exponents given above , @xmath141 and @xmath5 are consistent with eq .  .",
    "we can carry this analysis a bit further by making use of some simple facts in discrete differential geometry  @xcite .",
    "let us define the number of vertices with @xmath142 incident edges as @xmath143 .",
    "it is useful to introduce the notion of a `` defect '' that is associated with each vertex .",
    "the defect for a vertex is defined as the difference between the sum of the angles of all the faces at the vertex and @xmath144 . with this definition , it is easy to see that the defect of a vertices of types 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 are @xmath145 , 0 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , respectively . for any domain ,",
    "the total defect of all vertices on the surface equals @xmath148 ; this is essentially the gauss - bonnet theorem for a discrete interface  @xcite .",
    "thus we have the general relation ( see eq .  )",
    "@xmath149 therefore the genus of a surface and the number of vertices of various types are related by @xmath150 from the examples of domains shown throughout this work , almost all vertices are of type @xmath151 while vertices of type @xmath152 seem to be next most common .",
    "vertices of type @xmath153 are associated with blinkers and therefore should be few in number .",
    "vertices of type @xmath154 arise at a 3-fold branch of the domain and therefore seem to be the most rare .",
    "thus we expect that vertices of type @xmath152 scale the same way as @xmath155 which numerically appears to grow as @xmath156 .",
    "the relaxation process is naturally characterized by @xmath157 , the probability that the energy of the system is still decreasing at time @xmath158 .",
    "since energy - lowering spin flips occur rarely at long times , it is not immediately evident whether the most recent energy - lowering spin flip is the last such event or whether another energy - lowering flip event will occur sometime in the distant future . to determine if the energy has reached its final value in an efficient way , we use the following algorithm that is a variant of our acceleration algorithm . as a preliminary",
    ", we separately track both positive - energy and zero - energy flippable spins ; the former are those for which the energy decreases if such a spin actually flips .",
    "we start the simulation by running zero - temperature glauber dynamics until no positive - energy flippable spins remain . at this time , defined as @xmath159 , the configuration @xmath160 may have reached the final value of the energy .     versus time @xmath158 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( lower left to upper right ) on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "the averaging has been performed over @xmath50 realizations for @xmath163 , @xmath164 realizations for @xmath165 , and 2048 realizations for @xmath166.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]     versus @xmath40 for @xmath167 and 40 on a double logarithmic scale.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    we now proceed as follows :    * apply an infinitesimal magnetic field .",
    "if an energy - lowering spin - flip occurs , then the energy of @xmath160 is not the final energy . in this case , the system is returned to @xmath160 and subsequently evolves by glauber dynamics until again no positive - energy spins remain and a new candidate final configuration and final time is reached . *",
    "if an energy - lowering spin - flip does not occur , the system is returned to @xmath160 and a field is applied in the opposite direction . again , if an energy - lowering spin - flip occurs , the system is returned to @xmath160 and subsequently evolves by glauber dynamics until no positive - energy spins remain and a new candidate final state is reached . * if an energy - lowering spin - flip does not occur after the field has been applied in both directions , then @xmath160 is at the final energy and the survival time equals @xmath159 .",
    "we record the time when the energy of a system stops changing , from which we infer the time dependence of the survival probability @xmath157 .",
    "this time dependence is both surprisingly complex and extremely slow for small system sizes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s ] ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath168 , @xmath162 realizations had not yet relaxed to their ultimate energy by @xmath169 , a time that is seven orders of magnitude beyond the coarsening time scale of @xmath170 .",
    "the data cutoff for @xmath171 was imposed because of cpu time limitations . by @xmath124 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath157 on @xmath158 becomes smooth and reasonably systematic and a plot of @xmath157 versus @xmath40 on double logarithmic scale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s - large ] ) suggests that the long - time data can be reasonably fit to an inverse logarithmic dependence @xmath172 , with @xmath173 .",
    "we investigated the evolution of the kinetic ising model that is endowed with single spin - flip dynamics on a finite cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the system starts in the antiferromagnetic state and is quenched to zero temperature .",
    "the details of the initial conditions are secondary as long as the magnetization vanishes .",
    "( if the initial magnetization is non - zero , the evolution is much simpler and the ising ferromagnet falls into a ground state . )",
    "we asked the simple question : what happens ?",
    "a natural expectation might be that the ground state should be reached . a more comprehensive version of this presumption is encapsulated by the _ central dogma _ of coarsening , which asserts :    1 .",
    "ising ferromagnets have just two metastable states , which coincide with the ground states .",
    "2 .   if an ising ferromagnet is endowed with zero - temperature single spin - flip dynamics , or more generally with a non order - parameter conserving dynamics , then one of the two ground states is necessarily reached .",
    "3 .   the time to reach a ground state scales with the linear dimension of the system as @xmath9 .",
    "this central dogma is indeed correct in one dimension .",
    "however , for two - dimensional ising ferromagnets , there are numerous metastable states that consist of single - phase stripes whose total number grows as @xmath174 @xcite , where @xmath175 is the golden ratio .",
    "nevertheless , the failure of the central dogma in two dimensions is rather benign , as one of the ground states is reached @xcite with probability close to 2/3 .",
    "moreover , for most realizations , the final state ( either a ground state or a stripe state ) is approached in a time that scales as @xmath9 .    in three dimensions , however , the central dogma completely fails ; viz .",
    ", all its three basic tenets are wrong .",
    "first , the number of metastable states @xmath176 scales exponentially with the system size : @xmath177 @xcite . further ,",
    "the ground states are never reached ( for sufficiently large systems ) and the relaxation time is anomalously long .",
    "we provided heuristic and numerical evidence that the relaxation time scales as @xmath178 .",
    "thus for a macroscopic system with @xmath179 the relaxation time considerably exceeds any time scale in the universe .",
    "since the approach to the long - time state is extraordinarily slow , even for a system as small as @xmath45 , there are still realizations ( albeit a small fraction ) for which the energy has not yet reached its final value by @xmath169 , whereas the standard coarsening time is of the order of @xmath170 .",
    "we constructed a physical picture , based on the coalescence of blinker - like configurations , that instead predicts a relaxational time scale that grows exponentially in the linear dimension of the system .",
    "in particular , the survival probability @xmath157 , defined as the probability that the energy has not yet relaxed to its final value by time @xmath158 seems to decay as a power law in @xmath180 . while the mechanism of blinker coalescence appears plausible , we do not have a theoretical explanation for the functional form of @xmath157 .",
    "the primary feature of the relaxation that we wish to emphasize is that the standard picture of coarsening , characterized by a time that scales as @xmath9 , is inappropriate for the three - dimensional ising model with zero - temperature glauber dynamics .",
    "another striking feature of the three - dimensional ising ferromagnet is that a set of connected metastable microstates with equal energy is reached rather than a ` frozen ' metastable state .",
    "each such set of states contains a small number number of flippable blinker spins that can flip _ ad infinitum _ without any energy cost .",
    "thus the system can wander within one of these iso - energy sets forever . even though the number of blinker spins is small , the spatial volume over which the blinker spins can roam comprises of the order of 10% of the volume of system in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "the topology of the long - time state is much richer than that of the corresponding two - dimensional system . in two dimensions ,",
    "the only possible states at infinite time are the ground state or an even number of alternating single - phase stripes ( for periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "in contrast , the long - time states in three dimensions are highly interpenetrating and contain many holes ( fig .  [",
    "fig : g-20 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , the average genus of the domains scales with linear dimension as @xmath156 . aside from this global characterization of the domains ,",
    "it is not clear what are the most useful measures of the domain geometry .    while we focused on the cubic lattice",
    ", similar behaviors should arise for the kinetic ising model on other _",
    "even_-coordinated lattices in three dimensions .",
    "we deliberately avoided _",
    "odd_-coordinated lattices or other complex networks where the coordination can be odd , as the zero - temperature ising - glauber system quickly freezes , in disagreement with the central dogma predictions",
    ". however , this freezing has a local and trivial nature .",
    "for example , for an odd - coordinated lattice , single - phase droplets can arise , in which spins within a droplet each have more internal than external neighbors  @xcite , as illustrated for the example of a hexagonal droplet on the hexagonal lattice ( fig .",
    "[ hexagon ] ) .",
    "these droplets can thus remain forever in the phase opposite to that of the background .",
    "another example of this local freezing is the ising model with zero - temperature kawasaki ( spin exchange ) dynamics  @xcite , where again local defects quickly arise that stop the overall relaxation process .        intriguing and mostly unexplored behaviors arise for non - cubic systems ( fig .",
    "[ non - cubic ] ) , for example , a @xmath181 system . when the aspect ratio @xmath182 is small , the system becomes a thin square slab .",
    "we are generically interested in the thermodynamic limit @xmath183 with @xmath182 fixed , so a thin square slab does not reduce to a two - dimensional system .",
    "when the slab is thin , the long - time state resembles swiss cheese , with directed holes perpendicular to the slab .",
    "because of the periodic boundary condition in all directions , there is no possibility of forming the stripe states that arise in the two - dimensional system  @xcite . for @xmath184 ,",
    "corresponding to a long bar , the long - time state consists of a series of alternating domains of the two phases . as the bar becomes wider , percolation in the long direction",
    "eventually occurs , and the geometry begins to resemble the plumber s nightmare ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ non - cubic ] ) .     slab , a @xmath185 cube , and a @xmath186 bar.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=15.0% ] slab , a @xmath185 cube , and a @xmath186 bar.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=15.0% ] slab , a @xmath185 cube , and a @xmath186 bar.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=15.0% ]    it is striking that the three - dimensional system is so much more complicated than the corresponding two - dimensional case .",
    "this fact suggests that many more surprises await discovery for the kinetic ising model in higher dimensions",
    ". moreover , most of our findings are empirical in nature and they beg for the development of new theoretical perspective and geometrical descriptions of the domains .",
    "another challenging extension of the present work is to describe the fate of spin systems with a non - scalar order parameter , such as the xy model , that are quenched to zero temperature    we gratefully acknowledge financial support from nsf grant dmr0906504 ( jo and sr ) and nsf grant ccf-0829541 ( plk ) .",
    "to test the accuracy of our acceleration algorithm , the system is evolved until a cutoff time @xmath1 with zero - temperature glauber dynamics .",
    "then at time @xmath1 , an infinitesimal magnetic field is applied , that alternates as the system descends successive energy plateaux , until no flippable spins remain .",
    "table  [ tab : compare ] gives the final energy that is reached ( where no flippable spins remain ) when the acceleration algorithm is applied for different cutoff times @xmath1 .",
    "these data are shown for the cases @xmath168 , 20 , and 100 , with @xmath50 , 10240 , and 128 realizations , respectively .",
