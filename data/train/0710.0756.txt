    "the formation of a qgp ( quark gluon plasma ) is expected to be realized in high - energy heavy - ion collisons , _",
    "e.g. _ at rhic and soon at the lhc .",
    "one of the main tools for the description of such a formation is the relevance of relativistic hydrodynamic equations in some intermediate stage of the collisons , see fig.[qgp ] .",
    "[ hb ]    the problem of the hydrodynamic description is the uneasiness of the relation with the underlying fundamental theory .",
    "indeed , the experimental observations seem to indicate an almost perfect - fluid behaviour with small shear viscosity , which naturally leads to consider a theory at strong coupling and thus within the yet unknown nonperturbative regime of qcd",
    ". moreover the qgp formation appears to be fast , which may also point towards strong coupling properties .",
    "another key point of the standard description is the approximate boost - invariance of the process as predicted in the seminal paper of ref.@xcite .",
    "the goal of the string theoretic approach is to make use of the gauge / gravity correspondence as a way to tackle the problem of the hydrodynamic behaviour from the fundamental theory point of view .",
    "it allows to draw quantitative relations between a strongly coupled gauge field theory and a weakly coupled string theory    more specifically , the ads / cft correspondence between the @xmath1 supersymmetric @xmath2 gauge theory and superstrings in 10 dimensions can be used as a calculational laboratory for this kind of approach , at least as a first stage before a more realistic application to qcd .",
    "the unconfined character of the qgp gives some hope that the explicit ads / cft example could be useful despite the lack of asymptotic freedom and other aspects specific of qcd .",
    "as well - known , superstring theory is defined as the quantum embedding of a 2-dimensional world sheet describing the moving string into a @xmath3-dimensional space . in a qualitative way , the gauge - gravity correspondence can be given a geometric interpretation @xcite .",
    "[ hb ]    considering the cylinder stretched between the two @xmath4 in fig.[open ] , it may be described as a propagating closed string ( fig.[open ] left ) or an open string with ends on the branes performing a loop ( fig.[open ] right ) . in terms of fields ,",
    "a gravity interaction between branes ( left ) becomes equivalent to a 1-loop gauge interaction ( right ) .",
    "this gauge / gravity @xmath5 is also a weak / strong coupling one . indeed , considering a long distance between branes , it corresponds to a weak and thus @xmath6 gravitational interaction between branes ( left ) , while in gauge theorical terms , it is expected to imply a long - distance gauge field interaction including many excitation modes of the 1-loop open string , and thus a @xmath7 field theory at strong - coupling ( right ) .",
    "this duality property can be given a quantitative framework , in particular in the case of ads / cft correspondence .",
    "one typical and fascinating aspect of the gauge / gravity duality is the property of @xmath8 it states that the amount of information contained in the boundary gauge theory ( on the brane ) is the same as the one contained in the bulk string theory . in our problem , we shall make use in a quantitative way of this property by taking advantage of one of the remarkable relations due to the holographic renormalization @xcite . one can write @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the bulk metric in 5 dimensions , @xmath11 the boundary metric in physical ( 3 + 1 ) minkowski space and @xmath12 the v.e.v . of the physical energy - momentum tensor",
    ". the higher coefficients of the expansion over the fifth dimension @xmath13 can be obtained by the einstein equations in the bulk provided the boundary energy - momentum tensor fulfils the zero - trace and continuity equations .",
    "the interesting observation on which we shall elaborate , namely that there is a nontrivial dual relation between a perfect fluid at rest in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions and a static 5d black hole in the bulk @xcite can be proven using holographic renormalization . indeed , implementing the perfect fluid behaviour with diagonal elements @xmath14 one can resum @xcite the holographic expansion and get ( @xmath15 a change of variables @xmath16 ) the following bulk metric @xmath17 where one recognizes the black hole ( in fact a black brane ) with a static horizon at @xmath18 in the 5th dimension .",
    "in fact there exists a one - to - one correspondence between the thermodynamic properties of the black hole ( bh ) and those of the perfect fluid ( pf ) , namely its temperature ( @xmath19 ) and entropy ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "it is in this context of a static black hole configuration that one can go further than the perfect fluid approximation and derive the viscosity @xcite , using the kubo formula .",
    "indeed , the duality properties extend to a relation between the correlators of the energy - momentum tensor in two space - time points at zero frequency @xmath21 and the absorption cross section of a graviton by the static black hole in the bulk .",
    "one writes @xmath22}\\right\\rangle } } \\rightarrow   { \\frac}{\\eta}{s}\\equiv { \\frac}{\\sigma_{abs}(0)/16 \\pi g } { a/4 g}={\\frac}1{4\\pi}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the famous entropy - area relation of a black hole . from this relation , and putting numbers , it appears that the viscosity is weak , much weaker than the one computed in the weak coupling regime and eventually realizing an absolute viscosity lower bound .",
    "[ ht ]    the previous results were obtained for static configurations , @xmath24 for a thermalized qgp at rest . in order to take into account , as much as possible , the actual kinematics of a heavy - ion collision , it is required to introduce the proper - time expansion of the plasma . on the gravity side , it calls for studying non - equilibrium geometries , eventually of 5d black hole configurations , which represent in itself a nontrivial and interesting issue .    in ref.@xcite , it was proposed to build the dual geometries of the standard bjorken flow @xcite , that is the description of a boost - invariant expansion of the qgp , which is expected to correspond to the physical situation in the central rapidity region of the collision . in this context the questions why the qgp fluid appears to be nearly perfect ( small viscosity ) and why its thermalization time can be short have been discussed among other problems .",
    "one starts from a family of proper - time dependent , boundary energy - momentum tensors @xmath25 where the function @xmath26 corresponds to an interpolation between different relevant regimes , namely perfect fluid @xmath27 @xmath28 free streaming @xmath29 @xmath30 fully anisotropic @xmath31 @xmath32 using the holographic renormalization to compute the coefficients of the corresponding metrics in the expansion on the fifth dimension and after resummation , it was possible to solve the dual geometry for given @xmath33 at asymptotic proper - time @xmath34 it reveals the existence of a scaling property of the solutions in terms of the proper - time dependent variable @xmath35    analyzing the family of solutions as a function of @xmath36 it appears that the only nonsingular solution for invariant scalar quantities ( here the square of the ricci tensor @xmath37 see fig.[ricci ] ) , is obtained for @xmath38 this solution is the only one of the family corresponding to a black hole moving away in the fifth dimension .",
    "hence the perfect - fluid case is singled out and the moving black hole in the bulk corresponds through duality to the expansion of the qgp taking place in the boundary .",
    "consequently , the bh horizon moves as @xmath39 the temperature as @xmath40 and the entropy stays constant since @xmath41 note that again the physical thermodynamical variables of the qgp are the same as those one may attribute to the bh in the bulk ( with the reservation that thermodynamics of a moving bh may rise nontrivial interpretation problems ) .",
    "hence one finds a concrete realization of the idea @xcite of a duality between the qgp formation and a moving a moving black hole .",
    "there has been a lot of activity along the lines of the ads / cft correspondence and its extensions to various geometric configurations .",
    "dual studies of quark energy loss @xcite , jet quenching @xcite , quark dragging @xcite , etc ... have been and are being performed .",
    "sticking to the configurations corresponding to an expanding plasma and going beyond the first order terms in proper - time , one has obtained results @xcite on the viscosity , confirming the universal bound of ref.@xcite , on the relaxation time of the plasma and very recently on the inclusion of flavor degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "let us finally focus on the thermalization problem , which can be usefully taken up using the gauge / gravity duality in the strong coupling hypothesis .",
    "the problem is to give an explanation to the strikingly small thermalization time required for the formation of a qgp as can be abstracted from the experimental observations .",
    "already in ref.@xcite , it has been found that if one performs a small deviation from the black hole metric by coupling with a scalar field and analyze the so - called quasi - normal modes defining the way how the system relaxes to its initial state , one finds a numerically small value of the relaxation time in units of the local ( and evolving ) temperature . even if a definite value of this relaxation time can not be inferred at this stage due to scale - invariance ,",
    "this result was suggestive of a stability of the qgp in the strong coupling regime with respect to perturbations out of equilibrium .    in order to go further",
    ", one has to deal with the problem of the qgp evolution at small proper - times . in ref@xcite ,",
    "the holographic renormalization program has been pursued for the small proper - time expansion .",
    "relaxing the selection of the appropriate metric by requiring only the metric tensor to be a real and single - valued function of the coordinates everywhere in the bulk , one finds an unique solution corresponding to the `` fully anisotropic case '' , @xmath42    [ h ]    in the same paper , an evaluation of the range of the isotropization time has been proposed , by extrapolation of realistic estimates abstracted from experiments to the supersymmetric case .",
    "the idea is to match the large and small proper - time regimes at some value of the proper - time @xmath43 this proper - time is mathematically defined as the crossing value for the branch - point singularities of both regimes .",
    "physically , it is expected to give an estimate of the proper - time range during which which the medium evolves from the full anisotropic regime ( small @xmath44 ) to the perfect fluid one ( large @xmath44 ) .",
    "cd in order to give an idea of the possible physical implications of this strong coupling scheme , let us shortly reproduce the estimate made in ref.@xcite . implementing the estimated physical value of the energy density at some proper - time ( @xmath45 ) one finds @xmath46 this short isotropization time thus seems a characteristic feature of the strong coupling scenarios .",
    "it is clear that more realistic estimates should take into account less idealized dual models , corresponding to qcd , such as the lack of supersymetry and the finite numbers of colors .",
    "however , the non confined character of the qgp and the robustness of some predictions ( such as the @xmath47 ratio ) may give some confidence that this short isotropization time could be a reasonable estimate at strong coupling .",
    "from the present rapid ( and partial ) survey of some of the results obtained in the ads / cft approach to the formation and expansion of the quark - gluon plasma in heavy - ion collisions , it appears that the gauge / gravity correspondence is a promising way to explore some features of qcd at strong coupling .",
    "indeed some general features of this correspondence , relating at long distances the closed and open string geometries ( see fig.[open ] ) are expected to be valid in principle for various dual schemes and thus , hopefully , qcd .    in practice , the quantitative dual schemes have been more precisely elaborated for the specific ads / cft case , @xmath24 the gauge theory with @xmath1 supersymmetries . among the results , it gives a calculable link between the hydrodynamic quasi - perfect fluid behaviour on the gauge theory side with a bh geometry in the higher dimensional gravity side in and ads background .",
    "this relation can be extended from the static case to a dynamical regime reflecting ( within the ads / cft framework ) the relativistic expansion of the corresponding quark - gluon plasma .",
    "this , and many other applications , some of them using more complex geometries , less supersymmetric backgrounds and examining other observables , gives hope on the fruitful possibilities of the gauge / gravity approach to the qgp formation .",
    "as an outlook , it is worth mentionning some of the possible new directions of study one is led to consider . starting with the more technical ones , it is known that the bjorken flow is not exactly verified in heavy - ion collisions , since the observed distribution of particles is nearly gaussian in rapidity and thus not reflecting exactly the boost - invariance of the bjorken flow .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate dual properties for non - boost invariant flows , such as the landau solution @xcite . on a more general ground ,",
    "the whole approach still concerns only the hydrodynamical stage of the qgp expansion",
    ". it would be important to attack both the initial ( partonic ) and final ( hadronic ) stages of the reaction in the same framework and thus the problem of _ phase transitions _ during the collision .",
    "finally , one would like to have more realistic dual frameworks including a finite number of colors , flavor degrees of freedom and no ( or broken ) supersymmetry .",
    "i would like to address special thanks to romuald janik for our stimulating and fruiful collaboration .",
