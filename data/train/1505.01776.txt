    "the impact of religion on the demographic and economic evolution of the societies has been clearly stated in several studies . in the endless list of such contributions",
    ", one should mention the ( not recent but very interesting ) survey on this topic of iannaccone ( 1998 ) , but also iannaccone ( 1991 ) , ellison and sherkat ( 1995 ) , lehrer ( 1995 , 1999 ) , waters et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and , more recently , caltabiano et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , zhang ( 2008 ) , yeatman and trinitapoli ( 2008 ) , connor ( 2011 ) and connor and koenig ( 2015 ) .",
    "the quoted papers deal with the social dimension of the religion for what concerns themes like marriage , education , population flows and socio - cultural economics .",
    "a field of research quite neglected by economists and socio - scientists is that related to the influence of religion on the urbanization process , along with an exploration of its historical grounds economic and demographic characteristics .",
    "it is indeed widely accepted that many cities have developed on various seeds , e.g. water sources , river bridges , ores , ... , but many exist due to some `` religious purpose '' , in a large sense ( see durkheim , 1968 , eliade , 1978 , dubuisson , 2003 , dennett , 2006 , stark and bainbridge , 1979 ) .",
    "the cult allowed splitting , thus necessarily juxtaposing , the human experience of reality into sacred and profane space and time . in catholic religion",
    ", much religious activity is performed through the cult of saints , considered as intercessors with `` god '' .",
    "their bones and relics could even make `` miracles '' .",
    "the cult of saints emerged in the 3rd century and gained momentum from the 4th to the 6th century .",
    "it formed from greek and roman veneration of divinities , heroes , and rulers .",
    "it was established at `` sanctified locations '' which in turn could attract pilgrims , `` priests '' , and merchants , and thus did grow in population size , and became cities .",
    "no need to say that it took many centuries before some strong organization around the cult of some saint developed .",
    "it is well known that rival clergy up to bishops and their cliques have been fighting lengthy battles over who had the right to claim the saint for their own community and even scorning `` rival saints '' . whether there were economic conditions in play at those times",
    "is not a question raised here , - the answer seeming obvious .",
    "one of the causes of the protestant reformed is well known indeed . in italy",
    "( it , hereafter ) , known as a basically catholic country , - being closely related to the siege of the papacy , there has been for a while an important motivation about the cult of saints , to the point that several cities bear the name of a saint ( webb , 1996 ) .",
    "this paper explores the main characteristics of the italian society when isolating citizens living in the  cities with a saint name  , i.e. hagiotoponym cities ( see reading , 1996 ) .",
    "specifically , this religion - based relevant cultural aspect of the italian urbanization process is described under a demographical and economical point of view .",
    "in particular , we aim at exploring what saint - based toponyms imply in terms of the comparison between economic and demographic data .",
    "one may thus first wonder how many of these cities appeared and where they are located . also , it seems to be important to explore how important are they with respect to the population size .",
    "these questions can be justified as being related to studies on social science and urban planning .",
    "some motivation also arises from touristic , geographical , and cultural points of view . a third concern , but related to the previous one , is of linguistics origin , i.e. a search for the statistical distribution of names of saints attached to city names .",
    "the reader is addressed to the dictionary of farmer and hugh ( 1987 ) . a related question concerns the rare saints , e.g. those occurring only once , so called hapaxes ; how many of them ? the question `` why are such saints rare ? '' is outside the purpose of the present report .",
    "nevertheless , how they geographically distributed is an original question . a fourth motivation of our investigation , but not the least , is based on economics concern .",
    "how does being a hagiotoponym city , behave with respect to others ?",
    "moreover , is a specific saint `` better '' , in an economic sense , than another ?",
    "therefore , the first question being tackled in this report is : what city and how many , in it , have a  saint",
    " name in its appellation ?",
    "the ( not so trivial as it could be thought , at first ) methodology is explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "in particular , the data acquisition needs some very careful work as explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : data ] . note that a distinction will be made between male and female saints . in sect .",
    "[ sec : data treatment ] , we define the economic and demographic quantities which have retained our attention",
    ". moreover , it seems of complementary interest to observe the occurrence of less frequent saints , e.g. dislegomena saints .",
    "indeed , one might have asked , at the time of rising of such cities whether some novelty in names ( or cult ) , some rarity or in _ a contrario _ some popularity of a saint , would have been ( and is still ) beneficial within some `` competition '' . in studies of cities ,",
    "one often examines the rank - size or size - frequency relationships , in accord to vining ( 1977 ) and chen ( 2012 )",
    ". their analysis will be the main content of the figures displayed here below in appendix b and commented in sect .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] . for what concerns",
    "the rank - size analysis , a brief comment is needed .",
    "often , zipf s law ( zipf , 1949 ) is able to fit the relationship between the size and the rank of a given variable .",
    "such a regularity has not a strong theoretical ground ( see krugman , 1995 ) , and it is shown not to provide a robust analysis of the connections between demographic and economic data in our specific context . in this respect",
    ", it is important to note that zipf s law fails in several cases ( see e.g. giesen and sudekun , 2011 ; soo , 2007 ; cordoba , 2008 ; garmestani et al . , 2008 ;",
    "bosker et al . ,",
    "2008 ; vitanov and ausloos , 2015 ) . for this major reason ,",
    "we have considered more general rank - size rules based on the lavalette s law ( lavalette , 1966 ) . in doing this ,",
    "we have found robust best fits results , with high levels of @xmath0 and interesting interpretations .",
    "more specifically , in order to observe how many saints ( or cities ) concern the above questions , plots for the rank - size , size - frequency and cumulative distribution function can be made and are presented in order to find an appropriate empirical law : see sect . [",
    "sec : analysis ] .",
    "the @xmath1 of saints , with respect to the whole country , and with respect to regions should give some idea on  @xmath2  ( or some @xmath3 ) `` touristic spreading '' , at the time of community creations .",
    "thus , whether there is any geographical distribution , with special saints in some area , is discussed as well ; see sect . [",
    "sec : analysisregionalfrequency ] .",
    "next , since cities have often developed around churches or chapels , the question is raised whether there is any relation between  cities with saint names ",
    "( hagiotoponyms ) and present city population size .",
    "moreover , are the most popular saints associated with  large  cities ? is the cumulative distribution of interest ? in so doing , one may next wonder about the wealth of such cities .",
    "how do they fare nowadays ?",
    "this is examined through the ( modern ) aggregated income taxes ( ati ) of such cities  which represents the aggregate contribution that the citizens of each city provide to the national gross domestic product ( gdp )  in sect .",
    "[ sec : regati ] . the final answer to these questions",
    "is found through rank - rank correlation studies , in sect .",
    "[ sec : rankrank ] .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] contains also a comparison between the overall it cities situation and the set of hagiotoponyms in the respect of demographic and economic variables .",
    "it seems that the hagiotoponym cities build a reality similar to the it one , when the biggest cities are removed as outliers .",
    "we strongly emphasize the condition or constraint .",
    "note that there is no discussion here below concerning parishes nor churches nor chapels nor folk life events implying saints .",
    "this demands a very complex survey ; thus is not studied here . in this respect ,",
    "an interesting paper is kim ( 2007 ) on pilgrimage and towns in medieval christianity .",
    "we recommend its reading both for the outlined ideas but also for the bibliography .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that pilgrimage towns do not necessarily have a saint for name .",
    "cities we examine here below are in fact very rarely pilgrimage towns , though they have local saint activities .",
    "moreover , questions on why religious cities grow or fail , and why several saints are more popular than others are left for further work ; see stark ( 1996 ) for a starting point .",
    "a brief conclusion is found in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "appendix a contains the needed statistical toolkit employed for the analysis of the data , while appendix b contains the figures and tables presented",
    ".    * remark . * when finishing writing this paper , we became aware ] of a university of birmingham 2009 master of philosophy thesis , by c.h .",
    "morris ( morris , 2009 ) who examined quite related topics , i.e. the practice of venerating holy figures and their relics , and events that surround such worship , in anglo - saxon and medieval england . indeed , more or less quoting morris thesis abstract :    * _  [ the cult of saints ] was a cultural phenomenon that engaged all sections of society , and saints enjoyed high levels of popularity through their cults .",
    "not all instances were the same , and cults differed in size and construction .",
    "the distances over which cults could command attention varied , as did the social groupings that they catered for .  _    this very interesting work differs from ours , surely about the respectively concerned lands , england @xmath4 italy , the timing , and scientific approaches , but is highly complementary . we emphasize that we add much to this sort of investigations by considering also economic questions .",
    "in it , there are 8092 cities or , better , _ municipalities _ ( in italian : _ comuni _ ) shared among 20 regions nowadays .",
    "thus , data on population size and on ati have been collected at the municipality level , before selecting the cities of interest .",
    "specifically , we want to identify the municipalities which have a toponym related to a saint , so called @xmath5 . sometimes , it is not so easy to understand who is the truly related saint .",
    "for example , giovanni could be the  apostle  or the  baptist  .",
    "however , we consider that he is most likely giovanni the apostle . indeed ,",
    "the baptist is now called  giovanni battista  of  gianbattista  .",
    "a check of the official list of saints on farmer ( 1987 ) , indicates that giovanni can be associated also to more recent people , but this is irrelevant to a city original appellation .",
    "the identification of the true saint is sometimes not possible .",
    "therefore , we decided neither to pursue nor explore such a task further .",
    "the saint name in our list will point to a unique saint , who is then considered to be the representative element of the related category of the saints with the same name .",
    "it might be relevant to remove this constraint in more advanced religious studies .",
    "we also understand that a saint having given his / her name to a city is not necessarily a _ bona fide _ catholic saint , but only a `` saint by tradition '' ( see farmer , 1987 ) .",
    "we do not consider this ambiguity relevant to our consideration , - on the contrary .",
    "the investigated data is of three different natures : population data and economic data , and the city names .    *",
    "the source of the population data is the italian institute of statistics ( istat ) . in particular ,",
    "data on the population are extracted from the elaborations of the 15th italian census , performed by istat in 2011 .",
    "the population data taken for the municipalities are : number of inhabitants , males and females , number of families , people living in a family , average number of the components of a family , people living as cohabitant and not as a family .",
    "not all such statistical data can be examined here with respect to our concerns , but we recommend the data sources for subsequent work . * the economic data , i.e. aggregated tax income ( ati ) , was obtained from ( and by ) the research center of the italian ministry of economics and finance ( mef ) .",
    "it covered the 2007 - 2011 time window .",
    "the number of cities in it , and their regional or provincial membership have changed during this time interval , - in fact going from 8101 to 8092 . in order to quantify the cities from some economic point of view",
    ", we have averaged the ati of each city over that time window ( denoted as @xmath6 ) , taking into account the official merging of specific cities , when necessary .",
    "a warning is in order : the number of hagiotoponym cities has remained constant in the considered time interval .",
    "however , it was found that two hagiotoponym cities changed regions : san leo and santagata feltria moved from marche to emilia romagna in 2009 .",
    "however , the available official data considers such an administrative change as appearing in 2008 . to be scientifically consistent",
    ", we agree with the official dataset and consider such municipalities as belonging to marche in 2007 and emilia romagna after 2007 . * the data collection here above mentioned relies on the identification of italian cities having a toponym recalling a saint .",
    "such an identification has been a tedious stage .",
    "it was implemented in several phases which seemed worthwhile of presentation for justifying the subsequent data .",
    "firstly , a preliminary list of cities has been constructed through the application of four sorting procedures .",
    "secondly , a refinement of the preliminary list has been applied , and some municipalities have been ejected on the basis of our own established criteria . after this second phase , the list of municipalities with ",
    "appellation has been revised one by one .",
    "we make more precise here below the applied procedure . the preliminary list moves from the premise that some specific toponym might come out from deformations of the original saint name .",
    "the string  san  -which , at a first look , seems to be rather informative , being actually contained also in the words ",
    "santo  ,  santa  , ",
    "sant  , - would in fact lead to the removal of a number of acceptable municipalities from the full list of cities ( like _ camposampiero _ , in veneto , which derives from _ san pietro _ ) .",
    "thus , we provide a first sorting procedure by employing the string  sa  to the entire collection of 8092 elements .",
    "the resulting list contains 1321 municipalities .",
    "the second sorting procedure has been attained by employing the strings  san  ,  santo  ,  santa  ,  sant  ( note the blank space at the end of the strings ) for the list of 1321 municipalities .",
    "this second sorting has produced 636 municipalities containing at least one of the strings and the remaining 685 ones without the strings .",
    "the third sorting procedure has been implemented on the group of 685 municipalities , in view of further facilitating the identification of the municipalities of interest .",
    "the string  san  ( without space after the word ) has been employed ; whence it is found that 180 municipalities contain  san  and the other 505 without the string .",
    "the two groups of 180 and 505 have been manually checked line by line .",
    "all such cases have been carefully examined . in particular , as expected , there exists a number of municipalities whose toponym is a linguistic transformation of a saint name .",
    "we call them _ strange cases_. as an example , _ samugheo _ , in sardegna , derives from _ san michele_. in presence of a strange case , the assessment of the ( possible ) corresponding saint name has been performed through the reading of historical information related to the single controversial municipalities . this information has been taken from the official website of the municipalities and/or from wikipedia . when no information is available , the candidate strange case has been removed from the preliminary list of municipalities ( like _ santadi _ , in sardegna ) .",
    "all accepted as a valid hagiotoponym but `` strange cases '' are listed in table [ tab : strange - cases ] .",
    "+ hence , in the groups with and without the string  san ",
    ", a number of 28 and 23 municipalities , respectively , have been selected for being contained in the preliminary list .",
    "some _ collateral effects _ came out from checking the municipalities after the third sorting procedure .",
    "first of all , _ madonna del sasso _ has been included in the preliminary list , _ madonna _ being an italian name for the `` virgin mary '' , - a human saint .",
    "we became also aware about the existence of some municipalities in valle daosta with french saint names and in trentino alto adige with german saint names .",
    "thereafter , we performed a fourth sorting procedure in the total list of 8092 municipalities , by employing the strings  donna  ,  dame  ,  frau  to search for the equivalent of the virgin mary not only in italian , but also in french and german , respectively .",
    "the fourth sorting procedure gave us the possibility to add to the preliminary final list 1 further municipality not already included , _ rhemes - notre - dame_. the preliminary list , so , collects 636 + 28 + 23 + 1=688 municipalities .",
    "thereafter , came the treatment of several ambiguities , leading to several municipalities exclusions .",
    "the criteria for exclusion have been basically due to ( i ) names which do not `` obviously '' point to a specific human saint and/or ( ii ) whether the toponym , though being a `` sanctified location '' , is clearly derived from some bible fact or event .",
    "thus , we have not considered as `` saints '' 51 municipalities containing `` san '' as follows : 1 .",
    "acquasanta terme 2 .",
    "abbasanta 3 .",
    "villasanta 4 .",
    "villa santina 5 .",

    "santopadre 15 .",
    "( borghetto ) santo spirito 16 .",
    "san salvatore - san salvo ( 6 times ) 17 .",
    "san buono + some further explanation ( or argument for rejection ) about a few of the elements in the above list can be given .",
    "items 1.-8 .",
    "point to something which has been sanctified ( some examples : 1 .",
    "_ acqua_-_water _ ; 5 . : _ luogo_-_place _",
    "; 6 . : _ campo_-_field _ ; 7 . : _ lago_-_lake _ ) .",
    "items 9 . and 10",
    ". refer to the general `` concepts '' of angel and archangel .",
    "item 11 . derives from the holy cross of the martyrization of christ .",
    "could be confused with _",
    "santa lucia _ but should not be .",
    "item 13 . is a linguistic transformation of santo sepolcro : it seems that this city was originating from a chapel built by egidio e arcano , in memory of the jerusalem holy sepulchre , and does not refer to a human saint .",
    "items 14.-16 .",
    "refer to the holy trinity .",
    "santo padre is the italian way to denominate the pope , but here it refers directly to the christian god .",
    "santo spirito stands for the holy spirit of the trinity , while salvatore ( or , less frequently , salvo ) is the usual italian appellation of jesus , - who is not a saint .",
    "denotes a village which was named sancti boni or castrum bonum at the time of its foundation , to revere the holy goodness .",
    "however , it does not point to a specific saint , and has been removed from the preliminary list . nevertheless , we kept _",
    "( 11 times ) and _ raffaele _ ( once ) as @xmath7 @xmath8 saints , although they are not humans , but archangels .",
    "however , they are so much anthropomorphic that they can be here assimilated to human saints .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "after the constitution of the final list , we have assigned the related saint to each of the 637 municipalities .",
    "the sum of the frequencies of saint appellations is , unexpectedly , 639 .",
    "indeed , there are two municipalities whose toponym contains a couple of saints ( _ santi cosma and damiano _ in lazio and _ san marzano di san giuseppe _ in puglia ) .",
    "for these particular cases , the available municipality data , @xmath9 in terms of population size and economic features , has been shared equally between the two saints of the couple .",
    "linguistic transformations have been treated case by case . as an example , _ san lorenzello _ can be identified with _",
    "san lorenzo_. therefore , they belong to the same class ( _ lorenzo _ s one ) . in several  difficult  situations , the identification procedure has been analogous to that of the strange cases , i.e. the reading of the historical notes about the municipalities .",
    "the case of monte san pietrangeli , in marche , is a nice example .",
    "we did not find any saint named pietrangeli .",
    "the historical notes provide a different name of such a municipality , still used by its inhabitants , which is _",
    "monsampietro_. the reference saint is then _ pietro _ , the first pope .",
    "such linguistic transformation cases have been collected in table [ tab : ling - trans ] . as hinted here above",
    ", other complex cases are the municipalities with a hagiotoponym written in a foreign language .",
    "there are some ( 16 ) french names in valle daosta and some ( 9 ) german names in trentino alto adige . for the german names , it is a case of application of the bilingualism of that region , and there is a ( legal ) italian counterpart ( translation ) . the adopted criterion has been to translate , when possible , the french names in italian , and take only the available translation in italian of the german names .",
    "results are shown in table [ tab : strangers ] .",
    "the number of different saints , in the final list of municipalities , is thus 206 , as reported in table [ tab : tabla2 ] and table [ tab : tabla5 ] , containing 31 females and 175 males ; in which 15 and 101 are attributed to only 1 city ( hapaxes ) ; see table [ tab : tabla5 ] .",
    "the resulting distribution of the hagiotoponyms at a regional level can be found in figure [ fig17:italy ] .      to exemplify the procedure ,",
    "consider that we made two tables : one with the number of inhabitants and one with the @xmath6 values , both in decreasing order , according to the saint name , distinguishing between males and females .",
    "the top and bottom of each table is shown in table [ tab : tabla3 ] , [ tab : tabla4 ] , [ tab : tabla3-ati ] , and [ tab : tabla4-ati ] in view of outlining the number ranges . table [ tableatistat ] contains the statistical indicators computed for @xmath6 and population data . to highlight the role played by each saint ,",
    "population and economic raw data have been further treated in two ways .",
    "* data have been cumulated over the name of the saints as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the name of a saint .",
    "thus , @xmath12 is the set of municipalities which toponym derives from the saint @xmath11 , and represents the popularity of @xmath11 .",
    "specifically , the cardinality of @xmath12 -denoted as @xmath13- is the @xmath14 of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the intuitive notations for the ati values and for the number of inhabitants datum , respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) represent the ati ( number of inhabitants ) datum for the municipality @xmath21 and the saint @xmath11 , respectively . *",
    "furthermore , all data have been cumulated and next averaged to take into account the name ( @xmath11 ) popularity @xmath12 of the saints : @xmath22",
    "first of all , we provide a description of the dataset through the main statistical indicators . then , some specific aspects of the considered dataset will be treated , on the basis of the methodological techniques described in the appendix .",
    "the computation of the main statistical indicators leads to some interesting outcomes :    * it appears that there are 91 cities with a @xmath23 saint name for 31 ( female ) different names , as reported in table [ tab : tabla2 ] and table [ tab : tabla5 ] ; the most popular is santa maria ( including marie ) occurring 23 times , much preceding santagata ( 12 times ) .",
    "our statistical analysis shows that the distribution is rather skewed ( skewness @xmath24 ) and the kurtosis @xmath25 ; * from table 5 and table 6 , it appears that there are 546 cities with one ( or two ) @xmath26 saint name(s ) .",
    "the most popular is san pietro ( 43 times ) , but san giovanni ( 36 times ) is not far off .",
    "there are 175 different names .",
    "( recall restrictions , due to cosmo and damiani , and to marzano and giuseppe , as if there were 548 different cities ) .",
    "for these 548 hagiotoponyms , our statistical analysis shows that the distribution is rather skewed ( skewness @xmath27 ) and the kurtosis @xmath28 ; * there are 206 different saints ( 175 males + 31 females ) within the above grouping rules for 639 hagitotoponyms .",
    "this popularity ( @xmath29 ) distribution is rather skewed ( skewness @xmath30 ) and the kurtosis @xmath31 .",
    "the values of the statistical indicators provided in the above list illustrate an hagiotoponym - type of urbanization mostly related to a few very popular saints ( pietro and giovanni for males , maria and agata for females ) , but with a very large number of cities recalling unfrequent saints .",
    "this is totally in line with the deep cult of very important and popular religious figures like the virgin ( maria ) , the first pope ( pietro ) , etc .",
    ", along with widespread local traditions related to less famous saints",
    ".    table [ tableatistat ] collects the main statistical indicators related to the raw ati and number of inhabitants data .",
    "this table can be compared with the main statistical indicators associated to ati and number of inhabitants when the entire set of it cities is considered ( table [ tablestat - it ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the minimum values of ati and number of inhabitants share the same magnitude order in the overall it and hagiotoponym cases , while the maximum ones are remarkably different ( the maximum of it is much greater than that of hagiotoponyms for both the considered variables ) .",
    "however , it cities are on average slightly richer and more populated than hagiotoponyms .",
    "further information is bought by other statistical indicators : it cities are noticeably more volatile than the set of hagiotoponyms ( higher variance either for population and ati ) , and exhibit also a greater level of kurtosis .",
    "all these facts point to hagiotoponyms which describe a hypothetical it situation when the main outliers are removed , both for the number of inhabitants as well as for the ati .",
    "table [ tab : stat - treated - data ] collects the main statistical indicators for the quantities @xmath18 , @xmath20 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 with respect to the independent variable @xmath11 . by a methodological point of view , the closest integer has been taken for @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , at these levels , and thereafter , we have not distinguished between male and female names .",
    "the ratios between the number of cities having a hagiotoponym or the relative number of different saints ( in both case @xmath35 ) or the proportion of female saints in the overall counting ( in both cases @xmath36 ) are not small .",
    "nevertheless , it is not expected that distinguishing genders would bring much to the discussion .",
    "moreover , it should be obvious to the reader that to take into account the gender would lead to triple the number of curves , figures , columns in tables , or tables .",
    "however , we do not disregard the interest of such an investigation in the future , for a complementary paper .",
    "it can be observed from table 2 that , on average , there are @xmath37 hagiotoponyms in the italian regions .",
    "however , valle daosta is an outlier in the hagiotoponym distribution , since about 22% of the municipalities contain a saint name in that region . recall that valle daosta is an autonomous - like region , with much historical connections with france .",
    "in fact , in france , more than 5000 municipalities , out of about 35000 , i.e. about @xmath38 , contain a saint name . in the more extreme italian cases lombardia and trentino - alto adige",
    "are `` very poor '' in hagiotoponyms : @xmath39 , though these are regions in the north of it , like valle daosta .",
    "in contrast , calabria , a southern region , has a much above average @xmath40 hagiotoponym content .",
    "note that the largest percentages of female hagiotoponyms occur in umbria ( 0.6666 ) , sicilia ( 0.375 ) and calabria ( 0.1864 ) , as for the female / all ratio .",
    "in contrast , the largest percentages of male / all hagiotoponyms occur in friuli - venezia giulia ( 0.9412 ) and in lazio and valle daosta ( 0.9375 ) .",
    "basilicata has a noticeable feature : there is no female saint name in any city .",

    "the kendall @xmath60 for the case of it cities is reported in table [ tabletaurank - it ] .",

    ", it can be concluded that there is a strong regularity in the correlations between the two types of city ranking in it .",
    "moreover , it is also important to stress that the discrepancies between it and hagiotoponyms can be found in the number of inhabitants and in the ati , and not in how the corresponding ranks are associated .",
    "this further confirms what already found for the relationship between it and saint cities .",
    "the matter is quite different for the cumulated data rank correlations observed at the saint level : @xmath75 or @xmath76 , for which @xmath77 or @xmath78 , either for the total cumulated data per saint of for the reduced value taking into account the saint popularity : columns ( i ) and ( ii ) in table [ tabletaurankatipopf2ndtype ] .",
    "this huge variation in @xmath71 is , surprisingly , pointing to a redistribution of the ranks , following some sort of randomization .",

    "this appendix contains a few lines on the theoretical background of the empirical laws , along with an explanation of the kendall @xmath60 , for the reader convenience .",

    "the interested reader is referred to gabaix ( 1999 ) , gibrat ( 1957 ) , laherrre and sornette ( 1998 ) , ausloos ( 2013 ) , fairthorne ( 1969 ) , adamic ( 2005 ) , shannon ( 1948 ) , vitanov and dimitrov ( 2014 ) , mckean et al .",

    "hence , the rank - size relationship has been frequently identified and sufficiently discussed to allow us to base much of the present investigation on such a simple law .",
    "this may be `` simply '' because the rank - size relationship can be applied to a wide range of specific situations ( see martnez - mekler et al . , 2009 ) and zipf s law obtained in different models :",

    "another law is attributed to zipf : the _ size - frequency _ relationship , i.e. : the link between the frequency @xmath48 and the size @xmath42 of an `` event '' , is also in this case an inverse power law :    @xmath94    of course , deviations from the simple law often occur , as illustrated through fig .

    "<S> this paper analyzes some economic and demographic features of italians living in cities containing a saint name in their appellation ( hagiotoponyms ) . </S>",
    "<S> demographic data come from the surveys done in the 15th ( 2011 ) italian census , while the economic wealth of such cities is explored through their recent [ 2007 - 2011 ] aggregated tax income ( ati ) . </S>",
    "<S> this cultural problem is treated from various points of view . </S>",
    "<S> first , the exact list of hagiotoponyms is obtained through linguistic and religiosity criteria . </S>",
    "<S> next , it is examined how such cities are distributed in the italian regions . </S>",
    "<S> demographic and economic perspectives are also offered at the saint level , i.e. calculating the cumulated values of the number of inhabitants and the ati , `` per saint '' , as well as the corresponding relative values taking into account the saint popularity . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , frequency - size plots and cumulative distribution function plots , and on the other hand , scatter plots and rank - size plots between the various quantities are shown and discussed in order to find the importance of correlations between the variables . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that rank - rank correlations point to a strong saint effect , which explains what actually saint - based toponyms imply in terms of comparing economic and demographic data .    _ </S>",
