    "as a specific topic of non - equilibrium thermodynamics , heat conduction has long since been of central interest . instead of reaching a complete equilibrium state , the composite system under some appropriate perturbation enters a local equilibrium state  small parts of the system approach equilibrium but not the whole system .    within non - equilibrium statistical mechanics",
    "the theory of linear reponse , originally developed to account for electric conductivity , is a very import method to investigate dynamical as well as static properties of materials @xcite . in this context",
    "the famous kubo - formulas @xcite have led to a rapid developement in the theoretical understanding of processes induced by an external perturbation of the system .",
    "however , a direct mapping of these ideas on pure thermal transport phenomena ( perturbations due to thermal gradients @xcite ) faces serious problems : contrary to the case of external perturbations by an electric field , thermal perturbations can not directly be described by a potential term in the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "rather , the thermal perturbation is introduced by heat baths with different temperatures coupled to the system , thus calling for a more detailed description than is needed for electric transport . nevertheless , those methods are often used , eventually because of their immediate success in describing non - equilibrium processes @xcite .    recently , the main focus of considerations on heat conduction and fourier s law has shifted towards small ( one dimensional ) quantum systems @xcite .",
    "typically , these systems are chains of identical subsystems weakly coupled by some next neighbor interaction . based on the lindblad formalism @xcite or on techniques of quantum master equations @xcite ,",
    "heat baths are then weakly coupled to the chain at both ends .",
    "it has been found that in such systems the appearance of a normal heat conduction depends on the type of the interaction between these elementary subsystems @xcite .",
    "most quantum mechanical interaction types show a normal heat conduction behavior ( constant non - vanishing local temperature gradients ) , whereas for some special coupling the local gradient within the chain vanishes ( divergence of the conductivity , non - normal scenario ) .",
    "let us now introduce the model system , which we are going to investigate in the following based on the full numerical integration of liouville - von neumann equation as well as on a perturbation theory in liouville space .",
    "the dynamics of the quantum model for heat transport is given by the liouville - von - neumann equation ( lvn ) for open systems @xmath0 thus we have to consider super operators  here @xmath1  acting on operators in hilbert space , e.g.  the density operator of the system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the complete liouville operator of the open system under consideration is given by @xmath2 the first term controls the coherent evolution of the quantum system defined by the hamiltonian @xmath3 : it is defined by its action on the density operator @xmath4 according to @xmath5\\;,\\ ] ] like for closed quantum systems .",
    "the system @xmath3 is here a chain of @xmath6 identical subunits with @xmath7 levels each , coupled weakly by a next neighbor interaction , thus living in a liouville space of dimension @xmath8 .",
    "one could think of several concrete model systems , for example spin models ( @xmath9 ) , for which the hamiltonian would read @xmath10 the first term is the local part of the hamiltonian , whereas the second defines the interaction between the subsystems ( @xmath11 denote the pauli operators of the @xmath12th spin ) .",
    "choosing @xmath13 we get the heisenberg interaction and for @xmath14 , @xmath15 an energy transfer coupling only ( xy model ) .",
    "furthermore , to avoid any bias we will often use a random next neighbor interaction but without disorder ( the same random interaction between different subsystems ) .",
    "the chain is weakly coupled to two heat baths , one at each end of the system , given by the super operators @xmath16 and @xmath17 in ( [ eq:1 ] )",
    ". this bath coupling could be realized by standard lindblad operators @xcite , well known from the theory of open systems in quantum optics . another equivalent possibility is to derive a quantum master equation for the model system leading to a special bath coupling like e.g. in @xcite .",
    "we are interrested in the stationary state of the above described system , namely of the lvn equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) in heat conducting scenario .",
    "this stationary state - a local equilibrium state  defines a temperture profile and a heat current .    as a measure for the temperature @xmath18 of a single subsystem",
    "we use here the local energy of the respective system so that @xmath19 in units of the local level spacing , c.f .",
    "this should be appropriate for weakly coupled subsystems within the chain ( only a very small amount of energy is within the interaction ) . the operator @xmath20 measures the local energy difference between two adjacent subsystems @xmath12 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the energy current operator @xmath23 can be derived from a discretized version of the continuity equation ( formulating a current into and out of the site @xmath12 , respectively ) @xmath24    = \\hat{j}^{(\\mu-1,\\mu ) } - \\hat{j}^{(\\mu,\\mu+1)}\\;.\\ ] ]    both operators @xmath25 , @xmath23 , will be used now to investigate the stationary state .",
    "beside a complete numerical investigation of the mentioned stationary state , let us try to get the local equilibrium state of the system out of a perturbation theory .",
    "since the system of the last section is living in liouville space we have to work in this respective space , too .",
    "firstly , we consider the unperturbed system as our chain with both bath systems at the same temperature @xmath26 . since the two baths have exactly the same temperature we expect the whole system to settle in a thermal stationary state @xmath27 : this state should support neither a heat current nor temperature gradients  it is a global equilibrium state with temperature @xmath28 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the unperturbed system are given by the eigen equation @xmath29 where the ket - vectors in liouville space have been denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "a scalar product of vectors in liouville space can be defined by @xmath31 the ( unique ) stationary state @xmath27 is also an eigenvector of the system with eigenvalue zero , @xmath32 , whereas all other eigenvalues have a negative real part .",
    "this is due to the fact that asymptotically the system should enter the unique equilibrium state @xmath33 regardless of which state the system was at the beginning .",
    "no other eigenvector is able to contribute to the equilibrium state , i.e.  all other eigenvectors must be unstable .",
    "since the liouville operator @xmath34 is not hermitian , the eigenvectors do not form an orthogonal basis , i.e.@xmath35 is in general not the unit operator in liouville space ( c.f .",
    "but with the help of the super operator @xmath36 it is possible to find a dual basis @xmath37 with the property @xmath38    the system will be perturbed now by applying a small temperature gradient @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the stationary _ local _ equilibrium state of the system reached because of this perturbation .",
    "the liouville operator of the perturbation is thus given by @xmath40 the two environment operators are the same as before but now with two different temperatures .    in the case of a chain of two level systems",
    "each of the two super operators @xmath41 of the bath coupling at both ends of the system consists of two transition processes ( in case of finite temperatures ) @xmath42 with the two rates @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the coupling strength of the environment , @xmath28 its temperature ) and @xmath46 , @xmath47 are transition operators .    with this definition the perturbed super operator ( [ eq:7 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "the first two terms are just bath systems at temperature @xmath28 like in the unperturbed case , we therefore neglect these terms in the following . like in standard perturbation theory in hilbert space we can calculate the state correction @xmath50 in first order perturbation theory with respect to the stationary state of the unperturbed system @xmath27 ( keeping in mind that the eigensystem is not orthogonal ) as @xmath51 for a more detailed derivation of this formula see @xcite .",
    "since the stationary density operator of the system is now given by @xmath52 and since we know that @xmath27 does not give rise to any local temperature difference and current , the expectation values of the operators defined above are determined only by @xmath50 from ( [ eq:27 ] ) .",
    "we thus find for the local internal temperature gradient @xmath53 and for the local current within the system @xmath54 the current as well as the local temperature gradient depend linearly on the global temperature difference of the bath systems . under stationary conditions",
    "the current must be independent of @xmath12 , @xmath55 , so that ( [ eq:33 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath56 eigenstates and eigenvalues entering here the _",
    "conductivity @xmath57 depend only on the mean temperature of the unperturbed system , not on @xmath39 .",
    "based on this @xmath57 as a global property of the system , including its contact properties to the environments , let us call ( [ eq:34 ] ) `` external fourier s law '' .    furthermore , combining ( [ eq:23 ] ) and ( [ eq:33 ] )",
    ", we can define a _",
    "conductivity within the system @xmath58 implying also @xmath59 to be independent of the external gradient @xmath39 .",
    "we compare these result with the complete numerical solution of the lvn equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) , here for a heisenberg spin chain with four spins . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we show the local conductivity of the two central spin systems @xmath60 as a function of the external gradient @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , we find numerically that @xmath60 according to ( [ eq:21 ] ) does not depend on @xmath39 ( dashed line ) .",
    "the exact numerical solution of the lvn equation shows a weak @xmath39 dependence ( solid line ) .",
    "as expected , linear transport and our perturbational theory apply for not too large external gradients @xmath39 only .",
    "note that the full range of temperatures @xmath61 has been mapped here onto the interval @xmath62 $ ] ( @xmath63 is thus already a large gradient ) .     in a heisenberg spin chain of 4 spins as a function of the external perturbation @xmath39 ; the solid line refers to the solution of the full lvn equation , the dashed line shows ( [ eq:21]).,width=188 ]    we address now some remarkable features of very small heat conducting model systems , based on the numerical solution of the complete lvn equation ( compare @xcite ) .",
    "`` normal '' heat conduction ( fourier s law ) is associated with a constant but non - zero local temperature gradient and thus a finite conductivity @xmath64 independent of site @xmath12 everywhere in the system ( see @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] we show the temperature profile of the heisenberg spin chain for different coupling types within the chain .",
    "the data are obtained from the full solution of ( [ eq:8 ] ) .",
    "the majority of coupling types , the heisenberg coupling and the random next neighbor interaction , indeed show the normal behavior in the weak coupling limit as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ( @xcite ) .",
    "but this `` normal '' transport type does not always show up : a spin - spin interaction consisting of an energy transfer coupling only ( xy model ) leads to a vanishing temperature gradient off the contact regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the vanishing gradient in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] implies a divergent conductivity within the chain @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless the current remains finite because of the resistance at the contacts , therefore the global conductivity @xmath65 defined in ( [ eq:34 ] ) also remains finite for this special coupling type .",
    "therefore we could state that the `` external fourier s law '' is valid even if fourier s law proper does not apply .    for the current , in case of a normal transport behavior , in dependence of the internal gradient",
    "we find a linear behavior , like proposed by fourier s law shown for three different mean temperatures of the bath systems in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .    obviously , the _ local _ conductivity depends on the mean temperature of the bath systems .",
    "furthermore , we show the dependence of the conductivity on mean temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] ) .    by comparing these solutions of the full lvn equation with the results of the perturbation theory we find a very good accordance for not to large gradients , as expected .",
    "the perturbation theory reflects the vanishing gradient in energy exchange coupling as well as the normal linear gradient for heisenberg chains .",
    "also the conductivities are the same as found in the full solution of lvn equation .",
    "we have considered heat conduction in small quantum systems built up from identical subsystems weakly coupled by some next neighbor interaction . by a perturbation theory similar to",
    "that introduced by kubo but extended to the full liouville space of the system , we have been able to derive a quantitative equation for the temperature gradient and heat currents within such systems .",
    "these equations depend only on properties of the unperturbed system and linearly on the strength of the perturbation @xmath39 .",
    "the most remarkable point of the equation for the heat current and the temperature profile is the fact that the global temperature difference of the external bath systems shows up only as a parameter .",
    "this is not only a numerical advantage , since a diagonalization for different global gradients is no longer necessary , but also an interesting physical fact : the heat conductivity is independent of the external gradient @xmath39 , and the `` external fourier s law '' is always fulfilled , even if the internal gradient of the system is not constant , as long as the perturbation theory applies .",
    "our approach does not have the problem of introducing a potential term into the hamiltonian of the system , like in standard kubo formulas for heat conduction .",
    "the bath systems , modeled by a linblad formalism , directly define the perturbation in liouville space . like in standard perturbation theory in hilbert space , the first order correction to the stationary state of the system is expressed in terms of transition matrix elements of the perturbation operator and the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the unperturbed system .",
    "only the non - orthogonality of the eigensystem of the unperturbed system needs a more careful treatment , formally the equations are very similar",
    ".    investigations on further aspects of the derived formalism are in progress .",
    "we hope to clarify the question of the different transport behavior ( non - vanishing and vanishing local gradients ) under different coupling types .",
