    "there are today five detectors of gravitational waves ( gw ) in operation @xcite , all of them of the resonant type .",
    "it is thus important to study in detail the problem of the coincidence search .    in the past , after the initial works of weber , three papers on coincidence search have been published @xcite .",
    "these coincidence search was made under two hidden assumptions : + a)the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was considered to be very large , + b)the event time was considered to be equal to the signal time . + since we expect very tiny signals , the study of the problem when dealing with small snrs is fundamental .",
    "this is our object here using simulated signals but with real noise measured with the explorer and nautilus detectors .",
    "in order to clarify the distinction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 let us recall how an @xmath1 is defined .",
    "we describe the procedure adopted by the rome group , but a similar procedure is adopted also by the allegro , auriga and niobe groups .    for nautilus and explorer",
    "the data have a sampling time of 4.544 ms and are filtered with a filter matched to short bursts  @xcite for the detection of delta - like signals .",
    "the filter makes use of power spectra obtained during periods of two hours .",
    "be @xmath2 the filtered output of the electromechanical transducer which converts the mechanical vibrations of the bar in electrical signals .",
    "this quantity is normalized , using the detector calibration , such that its square gives the energy innovation @xmath3 for each sample , expressed in kelvin units . in absence of signals ,",
    "for well behaved noise due only to the thermal motion of the bar and to the electronic noise of the amplifier , the distribution of @xmath2 is normal with zero mean . the variance ( average value of the square of @xmath2 ) is called @xmath4 and is indicated with @xmath5 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath2 is f(x)=e^ [ normal ]    after the filtering of the raw - data , @xmath6 are extracted as follows .",
    "a threshold is set in terms of a critical ratio defined by cr== [ creq ] where @xmath7 is the standard deviation of @xmath8 and snr_f= [ teffeq ]    @xmath5 is determined by taking the average of the filtered data during the ten minutes preceeding each considered event .",
    "the threshold is set at cr=6 , in order to have about one or two hundred events per day .",
    "this corresponds to an energy @xmath9 .",
    "when the filtered data go above this threshold , the time behaviour is considered until the filtered data go below the threshold for more than ten seconds . the maximum amplitude and its occurrence time",
    "define the @xmath1 .    by the word",
    "@xmath0 here we mean the response of the detector to an external excitation in absence of noise .",
    "it is then evident that an @xmath1 is a combination of signal and noise . in the following",
    "we shall use snr to indicate the ratio between the @xmath0 energy , which we denote with @xmath10 and the noise @xmath5 , snr= [ snr ] the effect of the noise on the signal has been discussed in @xcite and it turns out to be larger that one could erroneously think .",
    "for example , with snr=20 ( for nautilus ) , one could think that most of the signals would be detected above the threshold @xmath11 .",
    "it turns out that the detection efficiency is of the order of 50% , as the noise might be in phase with the signal , pushing it even higher over the threshold or in counter - phase , pushing it below the threshold .",
    "this means that the detection efficiency for @xmath12 coincidences with @xmath13 detectors , in the case @xmath14 , is of the order of @xmath15 .",
    "the noise acts also in producing an @xmath16 different from the time the @xmath0 was applied .",
    "this influences the choice of the coincidence time window .",
    "we use two sets of experimental data , obtained with explorer in 1991 and with nautilus in 1998 .",
    "this is because the two detectors had their best performance respectively in 1991 and 1998 , and also because their detection bandwidth is very different in the two cases .",
    "the main characteristics of these two detectors are given in table [ carac ] .    0.1 in    .",
    "main characteristics of explorer and nautilus for the data used in the present analysis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ effic1n ]    the efficiency is also shown in fig.[effi ]    the theoretical probability to detect a signal with a given snr , in presence of a well behaved gaussian noise , is calculated as follows .",
    "we put @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the signal we look for and @xmath19 is the gaussian noise .",
    "we obtain easily @xcite probability(snr)=_snr_t^ e^- cosh()dy [ papou ] where we put @xmath20 for the present explorer and nautilus detectors .    the theoretical efficiency as deduced from eq.[papou ]",
    "is reported in tables [ effic1e ] and [ effic1n ] and in fig.[effi ] .",
    "we notice a deviation between experimental and theoretical efficiencies at small snr .",
    "this is due to the non gaussian character of the real noise .",
    "the time when the event due to a signal is observed deviates from the time the signal is applied .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ deviation ] the standard deviation against snr for explorer 1991 and for nautilus 1998 .",
    "the lines are the best fits with the following equations : + explorer  @xmath21 + nautilus  @xmath22 .",
    "we can write the empirical formula = [ formula ]    we see , as expected , that the time deviation decreases linearly with increasing bandwidth .",
    "if we extrapolate to a snr=100 and with a target bandwidth for resonant detectors of the order of @xmath23 we find a possible time resolution of the order of less than one millisecond , as already recognized with room temperature experiments @xcite .",
    "the delay distributions for signals with snr=30 and snr=10 are shown in fig .",
    "[ distris30_10 ] .",
    "we note for nautilus a few events with delay greater than 1 s with respect to the time of the applied signals .",
    "we have asked ourselves how it is possible to have a time deviation over 1 s for signals with snr=30 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the noise , although the data were selected so to have small @xmath24 , has not completely a gaussian character .",
    "we have considered the particular case of the event ( fig.[distris30_10 ] , snr=30 ) detected with the nautilus data 1.422 s @xmath25 the signal was applied . in order to understand this result we plot in fig.[delta1s ]",
    "the behaviour of the signal with zero noise , of the noise alone and of the signal added to the noise .",
    "for this particular case if we raise the signal to snr=50 the corresponding event has a time delay of -64 ms ( still not quite zero ) .",
    "if an additional filter is applied to the data , such as to require i.e. that the detected event behaved in a gaussian way , the signal with snr=30 is lost , in spite of being a @xmath26 signal .",
    "we remark also that the events have energy different from that of the signal .",
    "this is shown in tables [ effic1e],[effic1n ] and in fig.[distrisnr ] where we give the distributions of the ratio @xmath27 for snr=30 and snr=10 .",
    "finally we make the following consideration for the case when multiple coincidences with @xmath28 detectors are searched for . from tables",
    "[ effic1e ] and [ effic1n ] we deduce that when the signal is near the threshold the efficiency of detection in nearly 50% .",
    "this means that for these signals the total efficiency for @xmath29 coincidences is @xmath30 .",
    "since we want an efficiency near unity ( because of the very few possible gw signals ) we must consider only signals with @xmath31 at least twice the value @xmath32 of the threshold .",
    "we have studied the @xmath6 generated in a resonant gw detector when excited by gw bursts with @xmath31 near the threshold @xmath32 used for defining the events . for @xmath33 the detection efficiency is nearly @xmath34 .",
    "the efficiency goes to 100% for @xmath35 , and it is still @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "the time of the event might be different from that of the signal , with standard deviation depending on the snr and on the bandwidth of the experimental apparatus . in this analysis",
    "we have applied delta signals at the exact time of the samples .",
    "if the delta signals are applied randomly , as in the real case , the efficiency will be smaller and the time dispersion larger .",
    "delta - like signals can be lost if the requirement to satisfy the theoretical behaviour expected for a delta signal is imposed on the detected events , even for @xmath38 , as shown in fig.[delta1s ] .",
    "this can jeopardize a search looking for very rare gravitational wave signals .",
