    "[ [ games ] ] games : + + + + + +    two - prover games play a major role both in theoretical computer science , where they led to many breakthroughs such as the discovery of tight inapproximability results @xcite , and in quantum physics , where already for more than half a century they are used as a way to understand and experimentally verify quantum mechanics . in such games , a verifier ( or referee ) chooses two questions , and sends one question to each of two non - communicating and computationally unbounded provers ( or players ) who then respond with answers taken from @xmath4 for some @xmath5 .",
    "the verifier decides whether to accept ( or in other words , whether the players win the game ) .",
    "the question we ask is : given the verifier s behavior as specified by the game , what is the maximum winning probability of the provers ?",
    "it turns out that the answer to this question depends on the exact power we give to the provers . in the model",
    "most commonly used in theoretical computer science ( the classical model ) , the provers are simply deterministic functions of their inputs .",
    "we call the maximum winning probability in this case the _ ( classical ) value _ of the game and denote it by @xmath6",
    ". we could also allow the provers to share randomness , but it is easy to see that this can not increase their winning probability .",
    "consider , for instance , the chsh game  @xcite : here the verifier chooses two random bits @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and sends one to each prover ; he then receives as an answer one bit from each prover ( so @xmath9 here ) , call them @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the verifier accepts iff @xmath12 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the value of this game is @xmath13 .",
    "the second model we consider is that of _ entangled provers _ in which the two provers , who still can not communicate , are allowed to use shared entanglement .",
    "these games , which are sometimes called _ nonlocal games _ in the physics literature , have their origins in the seminal papers by einstein , podolsky , and rosen  @xcite and bell  @xcite .",
    "we define the _ entangled value _ of a game as the maximum success probability achievable by provers that share entanglement , and denote it by @xmath14 .",
    "notice that by definition , for any game we have @xmath15 .",
    "one of the most astonishing features of quantum mechanics is that sharing entanglement gives the provers the remarkable ability to create correlations that are impossible to obtain classically , and hence increase their winning probability .",
    "for instance , it can be shown that @xmath16 .",
    "this gap between the classical value and the entangled value has fascinated physicists for decades , and is used as an experimental way to validate quantum mechanics .",
    "another example of such a gap appears in the so - called _ odd - cycle game _ , in which , roughly speaking , the provers are asked to color the vertices of a cycle of length @xmath17 for some odd @xmath18 with two colors in such a way that the two colors adjacent to each edge are different .",
    "the value of this game is @xmath19 , whereas its entangled value is @xmath20 .",
    "the third model we consider in this paper is that of _ non - signaling provers_. this model is of interest mainly as a theoretical tool to understand the other two models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as two - prover games in general physical theories  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . here",
    ", the provers can choose for any question pair an arbitrary distribution on the answers , with the only constraint being the _ non - signaling constraint _  namely , that the marginal distribution of each prover s answer must only depend on the question to that prover ( and not on the other prover s question ) .",
    "this constraint captures the physical requirement that the provers are unable to communicate , and leads to the definition of the _ non - signaling value _ of a game , which we denote by @xmath21 .",
    "notice that for any game , @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , it is not hard to see that @xmath23 , since we can arrange the distributions on the answers in such a way that the marginal distributions are always uniform , and at the same time only winning answers are returned .",
    "an important special case of two - prover games is that of _",
    "unique games_. here , the verifier s decision is restricted to be of the form @xmath24 for some permutation @xmath25 on @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "if , moreover , @xmath9 , then the game is called an _ xor game_. an example of such a game is the chsh game .",
    "it is very common for the answer set @xmath26 $ ] in a unique game to be identified with some group structure ( e.g. , @xmath27 ) and for the verifier to check whether the difference of the two answers @xmath28 is equal to some value .",
    "if this is the case , then we refer to the game as a _ linear game_. in recent years , unique games became one of the most heavily studied topics in theoretical computer science due to khot s unique games conjecture  @xcite and its strong implications for hardness of approximation ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ parallel - repetition ] ] parallel repetition : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    one of the main questions in the area of two - prover games is the _",
    "parallel repetition question_. here we consider the game @xmath29 obtained by playing the game @xmath30 in parallel @xmath0 times .",
    "more precisely , in @xmath29 the verifier sends @xmath0 independently chosen question pairs to the provers , and expects as answers elements of @xmath26^\\ell$ ] .",
    "he accepts iff all @xmath0 answers are accepted in the original game .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath31 since the provers can play their optimal strategy for @xmath30 on each of the @xmath0 question pairs .",
    "similarly , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "although at first it might seem that equality should hold here , the surprising fact is that in most cases the inequality is strict .",
    "even for a simple game like chsh we have that @xmath34 ( which is bigger than the @xmath35 one might expect ) .",
    "the parallel repetition question asks for upper bounds on the value of repeated games .",
    "this fundamental question has many important implications , most notably to tight hardness of approximability results ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the first dramatic progress in this area was made by raz  @xcite , with more recent work by holenstein  @xcite and rao  @xcite .",
    "the following theorem summarizes the state of the art in this area .",
    "[ th : parallel ] let @xmath30 be a two - prover game with answer size @xmath36 and value @xmath37 .",
    "then for all @xmath38 ,    1 .",
    "@xcite @xmath39 ; 2 .",
    "@xcite if @xmath30 is a projection game ( which is a more general class than unique games ) then @xmath40 .    in an attempt to better understand the unique games conjecture , feige , kindler , and",
    "odonnell @xcite asked whether the bound on @xmath41 above can be improved to @xmath42 , a result called _ strong parallel repetition_. given the improved bound by rao , it is only natural to hope that the exponent could be lowered all the way down to @xmath43 . they observed that if such a result holds , even just for unique games , then we would get an equivalence of the unique games conjecture to other better studied problems like max - cut .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , raz  @xcite showed that strong parallel repetition does _ not _ hold in general .",
    "he showed an example of an xor game ( which is no other than the odd - cycle game mentioned above ) whose value is @xmath19 yet even after @xmath44 repetitions , its value is still at least some positive constant .",
    "raz s example was further clarified and generalized in @xcite by showing a connection between @xmath41 and the value of a certain sdp relaxation of the game .",
    "we mention that strong parallel repetition is known to hold in the case of projection games that are _ free _ , i.e. , the distribution on the questions to the provers is a product distribution  @xcite . see also  @xcite for an  almost strong \" parallel repetition statement for unique games played on expander graphs .",
    "parallel repetition is much less well understood in the case of entangled provers .",
    "in fact , no parallel repetition result is known for the entangled value of general games , and this is currently one of the main open questions in the area",
    ". however , parallel repetition results _ are _ known for several classes of games with entangled provers , as described in the following theorem , in which we also mention holenstein s  @xcite parallel repetition result for the non - signaling value .",
    "[ th : parallelforentangled ] let @xmath30 be a two - prover game with answer size @xmath36 , entangled value @xmath45 , and non - signaling value @xmath46 .",
    "then for all @xmath38 ,    1 .",
    "@xcite if @xmath30 is an xor game , then @xmath47 ; 2 .",
    "@xcite if @xmath30 is a unique game , then @xmath48 ; 3 .",
    "@xcite if @xmath30 is a linear game , then @xmath49 ; 4 .",
    "@xcite @xmath50 .",
    "hence , we see that strong parallel repetition holds for the entangled value of linear games .",
    "in fact , in the case of xor games , we have _ perfect _ parallel repetition .",
    "all the above results involving the entangled value are derived by ( i ) showing that @xmath14 is close ( or in fact _ equal _ in the case of xor games ) to a certain sdp relaxation ( which appears as sdp1 below ) , and ( ii ) showing that this sdp relaxation  tensorizes \" , i.e. , that the value of the sdp corresponding to @xmath29 is exactly the @xmath0th power of the value of the sdp corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "the above naturally raises the question of whether the entangled value obeys _ strong _",
    "parallel repetition , if not in the general case , then at least in the case of unique games .",
    "the nearly tight characterization of the entangled value of unique games using semidefinite programs @xcite ( see lemma  [ lem : sdp2rounding ] below ) is one reason to hope that such a strong parallel repetition would hold .",
    "raz s counterexample does not provide a negative answer to this question , since it is an xor game , for which perfect parallel repetition holds in the entangled case .",
    "similarly , in the case of non - signaling provers there has been no evidence that strong parallel repetition does not hold .",
    "in fact , because the non - signaling value is _ exactly _ given by a linear program ( lp ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , one might conjecture that strong parallel repetition should hold since  all \" one has to do is understand the tensorization properties of the corresponding lp .    [",
    "[ our - results ] ] our results : + + + + + + + + + + + +    we answer the above question in the negative , by giving a counterexample to strong parallel repetition for games with entangled provers .",
    "more precisely , we give a game with entangled value @xmath51 such that after @xmath44 repetitions the entangled value of the repeated game is still a positive constant .",
    "our example ( after a minor modification ) is a _",
    "unique _ game with three possible answers , the smallest possible alphabet size for such a counterexample , because unique games with two answers are by definition xor games for which perfect parallel repetition holds .",
    "hence we obtain an interesting ` phase transition ' in the entangled value of unique games : whereas for alphabet size @xmath52 we have _ perfect _ parallel repetition , already for alphabet size @xmath53 we do not even have strong parallel repetition .",
    "our result shows that the upper bound for unique games in theorem  [ th : parallelforentangled].2 is essentially tight .",
    "we also show that our game has a non - signaling value of @xmath51 .",
    "this implies that strong parallel repetition fails also for the non - signaling value and that holenstein s result ( theorem  [ th : parallelforentangled].4 ) is in fact tight .    as part of the proof we observe ( see theorem  [ thm : sdp1amortized ] ) using results from  @xcite that the asymptotic behavior of the entangled value of repeated unique games is almost precisely captured by a certain sdp ( sdp1 in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] ) .",
    "this is a pleasing state of affairs , since we now have a nearly tight sdp characterization both of the value of a unique game ( sdp2 in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] ) and of its asymptotic value ( sdp1 ) .",
    "incidentally , sdp1 was also shown to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the _ classical _ value of repeated unique games , although the bounds there were considerably less tight , as they include some logarithmic factors ( which are conjectured to be unnecessary ) and also depend on the alphabet size ( see lemma  [ lem : crounding ] ) .    combining the above observation with our counterexample",
    ", we obtain a separation between sdp1 and sdp2 .",
    "namely , for the game described in our counterexample , sdp2 is @xmath54 ( since it is very close to the value of the game ) whereas sdp1 is @xmath20 ( since it describes the asymptotic behavior ) .",
    "both sdps have been used before in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) and to the best of our knowledge no gap between them was known before .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , our example also implies that sdp2 does _ not _ tensorize , since for the basic game sdp2 is @xmath54 yet after @xmath44 repetition its value is still some positive constant ( since it is a relaxation of the entangled value ) .",
    "[ [ our - construction ] ] our construction : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our counterexample is inspired by the odd - cycle game ( yet it is neither a cycle nor is it odd ) .",
    "we call it the _ line game_. recall that the odd - cycle game was used by raz  @xcite as a counterexample to strong parallel repetition in the classical case . however , since it is an xor game , it obeys perfect parallel repetition in the entangled case , and moreover , its non - signaling value is @xmath43 , so it can not provide a counterexample in our setting",
    ".    roughly speaking , in the line game the players are asked to color a path of length @xmath17 with two colors in such a way that any two adjacent vertices have the same color , yet the leftmost vertex must be colored in color 1 and the rightmost vertex must be colored with color 2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : linegame]a ) .",
    "more precisely , the verifier randomly chooses to send to the provers either two adjacent vertices or the same two vertices .",
    "he expects the two answers to be the same , unless both vertices are the leftmost vertex , in which case both answers must be @xmath43 , or both vertices are the rightmost vertex , in which case both answers must be @xmath52 .",
    "it is not hard to see that the classical value of this game is @xmath55 , as is the case for the odd - cycle game .",
    "however , unlike the odd - cycle game , it turns out that the entangled value and even the non - signaling value of this game are also @xmath55 .",
    "an intuitive way to see this is to argue about the marginals on alice s and bob s answer to each question . forcing the ends of the line into a fixed answer forces the corresponding marginals to be close to distributions that always output @xmath43 on the left and @xmath52 on the right .",
    "the marginals for questions in between the ends must therefore move from the all-@xmath43 to the all-@xmath52 distribution , which can only be done at the expense of losing with probability @xmath56 . for comparison , in the odd - cycle game we can manage with a strategy where all marginals are uniform , and",
    "hence its non - signaling value is actually exactly @xmath43 !    as we will show in section  [ sec : linerepeat ] , after repeating the line game @xmath44 times , its entangled value ( and even classical value ) are still bounded from below by some positive constant .",
    "in particular , this implies that strong parallel repetition does not hold for the entangled value nor for the non - signaling value .",
    "this lower bound can be shown directly by explicitly demonstrating the provers strategy . instead",
    ", we will follow a slightly indirect route , using sdp[sdp:1 ] to argue about the behavior of the game ( or in fact of its unique game variant described below ) under parallel repetition , as we feel this gives more insight into the behavior of parallel repetition of unique games .    as described above",
    ", the line game is not a unique game , due to the non - permutation constraints on both ends . in order to provide a counterexample for strong parallel repetition even for unique games , we present a simple modification of the game that leads to what we call the _ unique line game_. roughly speaking , this",
    "is done by increasing the answer size to @xmath53 , replacing the constraint on the leftmost vertex with a permutation that switches 2 and 3 , and similarly replacing the constraint on the rightmost vertex with a permutation that switches 1 and 3 .",
    "this has a similar effect to the non - permutation constraints in the original line game , and as a result , the classical , entangled , and non - signaling values of this game are more or less the same as in the line game , both for the basic game and its repetition .",

    "our definition allows the verifier to associate more than one predicate @xmath67 ( in fact , a distribution over predicates ) to each question pair @xmath66 .",
    "such games are sometimes known as games with probabilistic predicates .",
    "we use this definition mostly for convenience , since as we shall see later , our counterexamples either do not use probabilistic predicates , or can be modified to avoid them ( but see remark  [ rem : paralleledges ] for one instance in which probabilistic predicates are provably necessary ) .",

    "it is not difficult to avoid these probabilistic predicates by replacing the end loops with small gadgets , while keeping the _ classical _ and _ entangled _ values of the game as well as those of the repeated game more or less the same , hence leading to a counterexample to strong parallel repetition using unique games with deterministic predicates ( namely , just add one extra vertex at each end , call it @xmath153 and @xmath154 and add equality constraints from @xmath43 to @xmath153 and from @xmath153 to @xmath153 , as well as a constraint that switches @xmath52 and @xmath53 from @xmath153 to @xmath43 , and analogous modification for @xmath154 ) . however ,",
    "note that it is impossible to obtain a counterexample to strong parallel repetition for the _ non - signaling _ value that is both unique and uses deterministic predicates .",
    "the reason is that _ any _ unique game with deterministic predicates has non - signaling value @xmath43 : simply choose for each question pair @xmath66 the distribution @xmath155 if @xmath156 and @xmath157 otherwise , where @xmath158 is the unique permutation associated with @xmath66 .",
    "this strategy is non - signaling , as all its marginal distributions are uniform . hence any _ unique _ game that gives a counterexample to strong parallel repetition in the non - signaling case must use probabilistic predicates .",
    "we now proceed to show that strong parallel repetition holds neither for @xmath141 nor for @xmath106 . we will show this by first proving a general connection for unique games between the value of sdp[sdp:1 ] and the repeated entangled value of the game .",
    "we emphasize that the following construction can also be presented more explicitly without resorting to sdps ; we feel , however , that the connection to sdps gives much more insight into the nature of parallel repetition , and might also make it easier to extend our result to other settings .",
    "compare this to the classical case ( lemma  [ lem : crounding ] ) , where we have a dependence on the alphabet size ( as well as an extra @xmath166 factor ) . in the entangled case , sdp[sdp:1 ]",
    "gives a tight estimate on the amortized entangled value up to a universal constant .",
    "we combine several statements from  @xcite . by lemma [ lem : tensor ] , @xmath167 .",
    "we now use the quantum rounding of @xcite , lemma [ lem : rounding ] to obtain an entangled strategy for @xmath29 with value at least @xmath168 , showing part ( i ) . part ( ii )",
    "follows by partitioning the @xmath0 repetitions into blocks of size @xmath169 and playing the strategy of ( i ) on each block independently .",
    "clearly @xmath174 for @xmath175 and @xmath176 and similarly for the @xmath177 vectors , so our solution for sdp1(@xmath178 is _",
    "feasible_. since the @xmath179 vectors are equal to the @xmath177 vectors , it is easy to compute its value @xmath180 which proves the lemma for all @xmath181 .    combining the above lemma with lemma  [ lem : rounding ] , we see that in fact @xmath182 .",
    "moreover , lemma  [ lem : sdp2rounding ] shows that @xmath183 .",
    "hence we obtain a quadratic gap between sdp1 and sdp2 .",
    "also note that the sdp1 solution above obeys the non - negativity constraint in sdp2 : the inner products of any two vectors is non - negative .",
    "in fact we can modify the solution to a solution with similar value , so that it obeys the @xmath100-constraint of sdp2 , at the expense of violating the non - negativity constraint , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : linesdp]b",
    ". hence our quadratic gap also holds between sdp2 and the two possible strengthenings of sdp1 .    combining theorem  [ thm : sdp1amortized ] with the above lemma",
    ", we obtain that for all @xmath184 , @xmath185 .",
    "in fact , the same lower bound also holds for the _ classical _ value .",
    "the reason for this is that the strategy constructed in lemma  [ lem : rounding ] uses a shared maximally entangled state , and performs a measurement on it in an orthonormal basis derived from the sdp vectors .",
    "since all the vectors in the sdp solution of lemma  [ lem : sdpline ] are in the same orthonormal basis ( and the same is true for the resulting sdp solution of @xmath186 ) , we obtain that the strategy constructed in lemma  [ lem : rounding ] is in fact a classical strategy .",
    "a final technical remark is that even though we obtained the above strategy by using a tensored sdp solution , the strategy itself is not a product strategy due to a  correlated sampling \" step performed as part of the proof of lemma  [ lem : rounding ] .",
    "we summarize this discussion in the following theorem .",
    "this shows that holenstein s parallel repetition for the non - signaling value ( theorem  [ th : parallelforentangled].4 ) as well as the parallel repetition theorem for the entangled value of unique games ( theorem  [ th : parallelforentangled].2 ) are both tight up to a constant .",
    "we complete this section by extending the above analysis to the line game , as shown in the following theorem .",
    "this shows that alphabet size @xmath52 is sufficient to obtain a counterexample to strong parallel repetition for both the entangled value and the non - signaling value , and in particular shows that theorem  [ th : parallelforentangled].4 is tight also for this case .",
    "the counterexample is not a unique game , but this is actually necessary : xor games obey perfect parallel repetition both in terms of the entangled value ( thm .",
    "[ th : parallelforentangled].1 ) and in terms of the non - signaling value ( even with probabilistic predicates , as is not difficult to see ) .",
    "we first observe that the classical strategy for @xmath186 constructed above has the property that both provers always answer @xmath43 on a coordinate containing the question @xmath43 , and similarly , they always answer @xmath52 on a coordinate containing the question @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the provers never use the answer @xmath53 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the vectors constructed in lemma  [ lem : sdpline ] satisfy @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and for all @xmath58 , @xmath191 . as a result , when taking the tensor product of these vector and applying lemma  [ lem : rounding ] ( as was done in theorem  [ thm : sdp1amortized ] )",
    ", we obtain the aforementioned property of the classical strategy .",
    "since the strategy does not use the answer @xmath53 , it is also a valid strategy for @xmath192 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that the winning probability of the strategy in @xmath192 is equal to that in @xmath186 ; this is because the strategy always answers @xmath43 on @xmath43 and @xmath52 on @xmath17 , and due to the way the games are constructed .",
