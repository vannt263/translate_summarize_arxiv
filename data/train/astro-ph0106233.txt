    "ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies ( ulirgs ) , identified by iras and defined by their high far - infrared luminosities ( @xmath1810@xmath19 l@xmath20 ) , have spectral energy distributions dominated by the 8 - 1000-@xmath21 m mid - far ir emission ( e.g. , soifer et al . 1987 ; clements et al . 1996a ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) and show luminosities and space densities in the local universe similar to those of qsos ( soifer 1986 ; soifer , houck & neugebauer 1987 ) . the excess of far - ir emission in these objects is generally thought to indicate the presence of large amounts of hot dust , but the mechanism for heating the dust remains controversial . intense nuclear starbursts and heavily - shrouded active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have both been advocated and a combination of both energy sources currently seems likely , with starbursts dominating at l@xmath22@xmath2310@xmath24  l@xmath16 and the agn - dominated fraction increasing to 35%@xmath2550% above this luminosity ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; veilleux , sanders & kim 1999 ) .",
    "ulirgs are almost always found in strongly interacting systems or advanced mergers ( clements et al .",
    "1996a , b ; clements & baker 1996 ) , during which large - scale torques on the intersteller medium and loss of angular momentum drives gas towards the central few kilo - parsecs of the system , where it is thought to result in intense starburst and/or agn activity ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ; mihos & herquist 1994 , 1996 ; norman & scoville 1988 ) . in this scenario , an ( obscured ) agn is switched on as the galaxy merger reaches an advanced state , and is then progressively unveiled as the circumnuclear starburst processes ( and expels ) the surrounding gas .",
    "obscuration is high in the mid - ir emitting regions of ulirgs , with model - dependent extinctions ranging from a@xmath26@xmath05@xmath251000 ( genzel et al .",
    "however , progression from starburst- to agn - powered emission as the merger advances is not evident in present studies ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "if ulirgs do contain obscured progenitors of future optically - bright quasars ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) they may offer a valuable opportunity to study an important stage in the evolution of quasars ( and powerful radio galaxies ) in the local universe . alternatively , highly obscured agn might not be common in the ulirg population since strong agn activity , once triggered , might quickly destroy the obscuring screen , producing an easily detectable agn ( e.g. lutz , veilleux & genzel 1999 ) .    in this context , the prototypical ulirg arp  220 ( ic4553/4 , ugc09913 ) , a double - nucleus system , is an extremely interesting object . in the diagnostic diagrams of genzel et al .",

    "5 ) it appears as one of the most completely starburst - powered ulirg in their sample , despite the fact that it is in an advanced merger state . in these final stages of merging , peak gas densities ( and related activity ) are thought to occur , when the merging galaxies are within a @xmath0kpc of one another and are in the process of coalescing ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) ; high angular resolution observations of the central kiloparsec are therefore vital to determine the gas dynamics in this important region .",
    "this paper presents the first subarcsecond - resolution , spatialling - resolved spectral imaging of the distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen ( ) in the central 900 pc of arp  200 , improving on previous observations by more than a factor of ten in angular resolution .",
    "hi is a valuable tracer of galactic structure and dynamics over a wide range of size scales and is a valuable tool for probing probe the gaseous conditions in the highly - obscured , compact nuclear regions of ulirgs which are often unaccessible at optical wavelengths .",
    "indeed ulirgs contain large amounts of neutral hydrogen ( e.g.  @xmath18 10@xmath27@xmath2510@xmath28 atoms  - mirabel 1982 ) , and recent vla synthesis maps of  _ emission _ in objects such as arp  220 ( hibbard , vacca , & yun 2000 ) , have revealed massive gaseous tidal features ( m@xmath29 @xmath18 10@xmath30 m@xmath16 ) extending over several tens of kpc beyond the optical emission and demonstrating the dramatic redistribution of material during galaxy merger .",
    "unfortunately , such studies of  in _ emission _ are limited by surface brightness sensitivity to angular resolutions of @xmath186@xmath31@xmath2510@xmath31 with current instruments . instead ,  _ absorption _ measurements can be performed to angular resolutions as high as a few milliarseconds in the presence of a bright radio continuum background source ( e.g. peck & taylor 1998 ; carilli & taylor 2000 ) ; subarcsecond resolutions achievable with merlin probe the distribution and kinematics of , in absorption , on scales of @xmath010@xmath25100 pc in nearby galaxies ( e.g. mundell et al .",

    "here we present new , 022 ( 81-pc ) resolution , @xmath221-cm  absorption observations of the central @xmath0900  pc of arp  220 with merlin .",
    "the observations and data analysis are described in sect .",
    "[ sectionobservations ] and the results in sect .",
    "[ sectionresults ] .",
    "we then compare the derived masses with those obtained from the molecular gas observations , and discuss the present geometry of the system and the history of the merger in view of these new observations and the available data .",
    "we adopt a distance of @xmath0 77  mpc for arp  220 , at which 1  correspond to @xmath0 370  pc .",
    "the central region of arp  220 was observed at @xmath221  cm , on 26th january , 1996 , with the multi - element radio linked interferometer ( merlin ) , which at this time consisted of 8 telescopes ( including the 76-m lovell telescope ) .",
    "the maximum baseline length of the array is 217  km , corresponding to @xmath0 1  m@xmath2 at @xmath221  cm and yielding an effective spatial resolution of 022 .",
    "dual polarizations were recorded for an 8-mhz bandwidth in spectral line mode , with 64 channels per polarization , resulting in a channel width of 125 khz ( 26.3  ) . as the first channel is reserved for on - line information ,",
    "the centre of the band lies at channel 31.5 , corresponding to an optical heliocentric velocity of 5496.2  .",
    "total observing time on arp  220 was @xmath07 hours , with 2 minutes observations of the phase calibrator 1551 + 239 interleaved every 5 minutes throughout the observations .",
    "absolute flux calibration was determined from observations of 3c286 , assuming a flux density of 14.731 jy at 1420.4 mhz ( baars et al .",
    "0552 + 398 was used to determine bandpass corrections for the spectral line data .",
    "after preliminary amplitude calibration and gain - elevation corrections were applied , using local merlin software , the data were transferred to the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips - van moorsel , kemball & greisen 1996 ) for all subsequent calibration , editing and imaging .",
    "standard calibration and data editing ( greisen & murphy 1998 ) were performed on the ` pseudo - continuum ' dataset , which is formed by averaging the central 75% ( 6 mhz ) of the band ( analogous to the vla ` channel 0 ' dataset ) .",
    "the resulting map of the phase calibrator was used to guide additional data editing and self - calibration ; the derived phase and gain corrections were applied to the arp  220 pseudo - continuum data , from which a preliminary image was produced and used in further data editing and phase self - calibration .",
    "the total corrections and data flags were then applied to the spectral line data and bandpass calibration was performed . due to good bandpass stability , no significant improvement to the continuum images was achieved by iteratively performing self - calibation and bandpass calibrations .",
    "finally , the telescopes were reweighted according to their gains .",
    "the continuum contribution ( formed from the line - free channels 5 - 15 and 50 - 60 ) was subtracted in the @xmath32 plane using aips task uvlin .",
    "the corresponding ` true ' continuum dataset was formed from the same line - free channels in the @xmath32 plane using avspc .",
    "these two datasets were then fourier transformed with uniform weighting ( pixel size 45  mas ) , deconvolved and added together to form the absorption cube ( 512  @xmath3  512  @xmath3  63 ) with the correct continuum level adjacent to the line .",
    "a circular restoring beam of size 022 was used for both datasets and the r.m.s .",
    "noise levels were @xmath0 0.1  and 0.5  per channel for the continuum image and spectral line cube , respectively .",
    "the commonly - used phase - referencing technique of interspersing observations of the target source with regular and frequent observations of a nearby calibrator with known position allows the absolute position of the target source to be determined ; the accuracy of the calibrator position is therefore important .",
    "our phase calibrator , 1551 + 239 , was originally identified in the calibrator survey of patnaik et al .",
    "( patnaik et al . 1992 ; browne et al . 1998 ) and lies in ` region 2 ' or declination range 20@xmath2535  ( wilkinson et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the typical positional uncertainty for the survey is 50 mas but ` region 2 ' suffered from larger systematic errors than other regions of the survey .",
    "the origin of these errors is unknown and the positional uncertainty for 1551 + 239 , which was omitted from the final published survey , might be as large as 100 mas , predominantly in declination ( thomasson , private communication ) .",
    "positions derived from previous vla images at 5 ghz ( baan & haschick ( 1995 ) , 15 and 22 ghz ( norris , 1988 ) also show a range of values , differing primarily in declination by @xmath0100@xmath25200 mas .",
    "consequently , the positional uncertainty for arp  220 is no better than 100 mas .",
    "nevertheless , the derived position for the western nucleus , @xmath33 = 15@xmath3432@xmath354689142s , @xmath36 = 2340080215 , compares well with positions derived from co observations by ssy99 , @xmath37 = 15@xmath3432@xmath354688s , @xmath38 = 2340080 ( @xmath1101 ) , and 5-ghz merlin observations by baan ( private communication ) , @xmath37 = 15@xmath3432@xmath354689053s , @xmath38 = 2340080509 .",
    "it should be noted that although the positional uncertainties limit very accurate absolute registration with observations from other instruments , the merlin results presented here are not otherwise affected since arp  220 is strong enough for self - calibration to be performed .",
    "examination of the observed  absorption line profiles revealed that not all are well approximated by a single gaussian profile , due to the presence of additional narrow components and/or wings overimposed on the main , relatively broad component .",
    "simple , automatic moment analysis is therefore difficult and may result in corrupted velocity fields , where a single gaussian component does not represent the centroid velocity accurately .",
    "we therefore performed a multiple gaussian profile fitting of the absorption spectra using a modified version of the fit / spec software ( rousset 1992 ) , originally developed to fit optical emission lines .",
    "the fitting was performed in two stages .",
    "first a single gaussian profile was fitted automatically to each absorption spectrum and residuals were examined to detect regions where additional components where likely to be present ( i.e. regions with residuals higher than three times the @xmath39 = 0.5  noise level ) - these regions coincided with each nucleus . for each nucleus , the spectral characteristics of the additional components were then determined by fitting to individual spectra with the most contrast .",
    "next , a multi - component gaussian fit to the line profiles was performed , using one relatively broad gaussian component ( the ` main ' component ) and a set of narrower components with fixed characteristics ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this second step was successful for the western nucleus which exhibited the strongest , most distinct , additional components , but failed for the eastern nucleus where the additional components were poorly contrasted ( peak amplitude typically lower than 6@xmath39 ) .",
    "therefore , the moment maps presented in this paper correspond to a single gaussian component fit to spectra from off - nuclear regions and the eastern nucleus , and a multiple gaussian component fit to spectra from the western nucleus .",
    "errors on the centroid velocity in the eastern nucleus due to the use of a single gaussian profile are typically lower than 10  .",
    "the merlin image of the @xmath221-cm ( 1.4-ghz ) radio continuum emission from the nuclear region of arp  220 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the two nuclei ( baan et al .",
    "1987 ; norris 1988 ; baan & haschick 1995 , bh95 hereafter ) are clearly resolved and are embedded in more complex extended emission .",
    "the nuclei are labelled e and w in figure1 ( labelled a and b in the 5-ghz image of bh95 ) .",
    "their peak and integrated fluxes are 28.7@xmath111.4  & 126.5@xmath116.4  mjy ( e ) and 64.9@xmath113.3  & 129.3@xmath116.5  mjy ( w ) , respectively .",
    "the total integrated flux density of the source is @xmath0 285.4@xmath1114.3  mjy .",
    "a large - area box flux yields a slightly higher integrated flux , indicating the presence of structures extended on scales larger than 1 - 2 .",
    "the presence of extended emission is also suggested by the higher integrated flux densities of 302  mjy ( white & becker , 1992 ) and 312  mjy ( condon & dressel , 1978 ) measured with single dish telescopes at 1.4 ghz and 2.4 ghz respectively .",
    "gaussian fitting to the merlin image reveals that the eastern nucleus is well resolved ( as can be seen in figure 1 ) , with a deconvolved size ( fwhm ) of 440  @xmath3  345  mas ( i.e. @xmath0160 @xmath3 130  pc ) in pa = 550  @xmath11  07 .",
    "the western nucleus is only marginally resolved with a deconvolved size ( fwhm ) of 245  @xmath3  190  mas ( i.e. 90 @xmath3 70  pc ) in pa = 96.3  @xmath11  07 .",
    "the derived position for the western nucleus is @xmath37 = 15@xmath3432@xmath354689142s , @xmath38 = 2340080215 which corresponds well with observations at other frequencies ( see section [ sectionobservationspositions ] for full discussion ) .",
    "in addition to emission from the two nuclei , a tongue of @xmath221-cm continuum emission is seen to the south - east of the western nucleus ( figure 1 ) and corresponds to emission previously identified by bh95 ( component c in their paper ) at 5  ghz .",
    "similar weak extensions are seen around the eastern nucleus . finally , a broad spur of continuum emission ( labelled t in figure 1 ) is seen north - west of the western nucleus .",
    "it extends over 08 in pa @xmath4050 .",
    "this weak component is detected over @xmath0 11 beam areas , with a peak flux density of @xmath0 1.6  and an integrated flux density of 6.6  .",
    "there is a hint for the presence of a similar component in the 5-ghz naturally weighted image of bh95 ( their fig .  1 , upper panel ) , but their angular resolution ( 043 ) is insufficient to deblend it from the emission of the western nucleus .",
    "figure 2 shows the merlin spectral channel images of absorption detected across the central @xmath0600  pc of arp  220 .",
    "comparison of the channel images with the continuum image , which is displayed to the same scale in the top left panel , shows that absorption is clearly detected against each continuum nucleus , as well as against the bridge of continuum that connects the two nuclei .",
    "figure 3 shows some representative absorption spectra , taken from eight locations across the continuum structure ; many of the absorption lines are asymmetric with some showing additional velocity components ( e.g. location ` er ' ) .",
    "the ability to image neutral gas in absorption depends on both the structure of the background continuum emission and the distribution of the foreground absorbing gas ; the neutral gas in arp  220 is spatially extended and so the absorption is well resolved at this angular resolution , in particular against the extended continuum emission of the eastern nucleus .",
    "the velocity range over which absorption is detected ranges from @xmath0 5160  to 5725  and compares well with the width of the single dish absorption line at 10% of the peak absorption ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) .",
    "however , this is lower than the full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of the single dish profile , @xmath0 640  ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) .",
    "if weak absorption is present against weak , extended radio continuum emission , this absorption would not be detectable in the merlin observations , and this may explain the additional 50-  width at the red and blue extremes of the single dish profile .",
    "hi absorption is not detected against the continuum component c , to the south - east of the western nucleus ( figure 3 ) , to a limiting 3@xmath39 absorption depth of 1.5  .",
    "assuming a constant column density across c , this implies a maximum column density  @xmath0 1.7 @xmath3 10@xmath4 t@xmath8(k )  , where t@xmath5(k ) is the spin temperature for which the exact value is unkown but is found to be typically @xmath010@xmath41@xmath2510@xmath42 k in the galaxy ( heiles & kulkarni 1988 ) .",
    "the weakness of continuum component c prevents the determination of stringent upper limits for , but the relatively blue colour of the infrared component coincident with c ( scoville et al . 1998 ) provides support for a low column density in this region .",
    "very weak  absorption may be present against the spur of weak , extended continuum emission ( t ) to the north - west of the western nucleus , but the continuum emission is weak in this region ( peak flux density @xmath0 1.6  ) , preventing a reliable determination of column density ; a 3@xmath39 detection would require a column density  @xmath18  1.3  @xmath3  10@xmath43  t@xmath8(k )  .",
    "close inspection of the spectral channel images in figure 2 , over a velocity range @xmath05500 @xmath25 5300  , suggests a possible weak absorption component extended in the same pa as the continuum extension ( @xmath4050 ) , but more sensitive observations would be required to confirm its detection and measure the column density .",
    "figure 4 shows the two - dimensional column density distribution and velocity field of the main kinematic component , as derived from multi - component gaussian profile fitting of the spectra ( see sect .",
    "[ sectionobservationsanalysis ] ) .",
    "characteristics of the main and additional kinematic components in the eight spectra displayed in figure 3 are listed in table 1 and examples of gaussian fitting to components in the eastern and western disks are shown in figure 5 and figure 6 , respectively .",

    "1991 ; syb97 ; ds98 ) , which comprise a large fraction of the mass of the system , are probably the result of this process .",
    "thus , given the similarities between the pa and kinematics of these two overlaping disks , it is likely that the two constitute a single ( warped ) disk , and so we use the term ` eastern disk ' in the following discusision to refer to the association of these two disks . the second argument in favor of the eastern nucleus being the retrograde one , comes from the morphology of the western nucleus . in the mh96 simulations and after the first close passage , the prograde nucleus has lost up to 50% of its mass , either accreted by the retrograde disk or launched into tidal tails .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the observed properties of the western disk , which is more compact , less massive than its companion and is likely the origin of the north - western optical plume ( hvy2000 ) .",
    "if the western nucleus is indeed the core of the prograde galaxy , this has important implications for the current geometry of the system",
    ". based on the good agreement between the mean velocity of the western disk and the line of sight velocity of gas in the large - scale co disk at this position ( syb97 ) , previous studies have assumed that the western disk was orbiting in the plane of the ` large - scale ' co disk ( e.g. see fig .  7 in syb97 or fig .  5 in ssy99 ) .",
    "in this context , the deprojected locations of the two nuclei were derived from their mean line of sight velocities , and the western nucleus was placed closer along our line of sight than the eastern nuclear disk ( e.g. see fig .",
    "24 in ds98 ) .",
    "however , for the western nucleus to be the prograde nucleus its orbit must pass _ behind _ the eastern nucleus , so the location of the western nucleus on its orbital path is therefore important .",
    "the absence of an  absorption signature from eastern - disk gas in the spectra of the western nucleus indicates that the western disk lies above the eastern disk , while the mean blueshifted velocity of the western disk with respect to the eastern disk ( @xmath0 @xmath25170  , ssy99 ) , permits only the far - sided half of the orbit ( see figure 7 ) ; combining these two constraints results in the western disk lying on the orbit quadrant above the eastern disk , on its final inward journey towards collision with the eastern disk ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the presence of disturbed  in the bridge ( b ) connecting the two nuclei further supports this merger scenario with the eastern edge of the western disk merging with the main disk .    continuing our comparison with the models of mh96 and assuming that the eastern nucleus is the retrograde nucleus",
    ", we can investigate how and when two important starburst events in arp  220 fit in such a scenario .",
    "the first event is that which gave birth to the galactic superwind and the associated kiloparsec scale bubbles observed in arp  220 ( heckman , armus & miley 1987 1990 , ham90 hereafter ; heckman et al .",
    "1996 , hdew96 hereafter ) . given the kinematic expansion time of the bubbles ( 3 @xmath3 10@xmath55 yr , hdew96 , from ham90 ) and the time needed by a ( continuous ) starburst to deposit significant mechanical energy into its environment ( @xmath23 10@xmath55  yr , fig .  56 in leitherer & heckman 1995 , lh95 hereafter ) , the starburst powering this outflow must have started a 10@xmath55 to 10@xmath17 years ago ( additional time may have been necessary for the superwind to break out from the gaseous disk ) .",
    "as the orientation of the outflow is roughly perpendicular to the major axis of the eastern disk , it is likely that this starburst took place in this disk .",
    "assuming that the arp  220 merger is currently in the stage just before the final fusion of the two gas rich systems ( i.e. t @xmath0 58 - 60 in fig .  12 in mh96 )",
    "this corresponds 1.3 @xmath3 10@xmath55  yr ( see mh96 - sect .",
    "2.1 ) . ] to t @xmath0 50 - 56 in the simulations .",
    "in the simulations , the retrograde disk does indeed experience a continuous period of star formation ( which is stronger than in the prograde disk , mh96 ) during these intermediate times ( fig .  13 in mh96 ) .",
    "note that , assuming that all the mechanical energy deposited by the starburst is injected into the wind , the mechanical luminosity of the superwind ( @xmath0 10@xmath56 erg  s@xmath12 , hdew96 ) corresponds to a star formation rate of @xmath0 10 - 100  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 ( lh96 - fig .",
    "56 for a continuous star formation rate ) .",
    "these values are lower than the recent star formation rate estimated in arp  220 ( @xmath0 240  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 , anantharamaiah et al . 2000 ) , but are consistent with the models which predict a sharp increase in the star formation rate in the final stage of the merger compared to the intermediate times ( mh96 - fig .",
    "14 , second row ) .",
    "the second starburst event , more recent and probably more violent ( consistent with the models of mh96 described above ) , is the one revealed by the large number of luminous radio supernovae detected in the western nucleus ( smith et al .",
    "1998 , slld98 hereafter ) .",
    "the rate of type ii supernovea inferred from these observations is 1 - 4 yr@xmath12 and corresponds to a star formation rate ranging from 50 to 800  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 ( lh95 - fig .  6 for a continuous star formation rate ) .",
    "this is consistent with the value of 160  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 that can be inferred line emission in their observations come from the western nucleus .",
    "if we scale the total star formation rate ( 240  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 ) accordingly , this gives a star formation rate for the western nucleus alone of @xmath0 160  m@xmath16  yr@xmath12 .",
    "] for the western nucleus from the observations of anantharamaiah et al .",
    "one striking feature of the distribution is the luminous radio supernovae ( slld98 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the positions of the radio supernovae and oh megamaser emission features with respect to the merlin 1.4-ghz continuum emission .",
    "the fitted positions of the e and w nuclei as derived from the merlin 1.4-ghz continuum image ( sect .",
    "[ sectionresultscontinuum ] ) and from similar merlin observations made at 5 ghz ( baan , private communication ) are also shown .",
    "there is a clear offset between the rsn and the nuclear positions , particularly for the western nucleus where the supernovae are located @xmath001  @xmath25  015 _ south _ of the western nucleus and consequently , the compact central feature of the w1 oh megamaser emission ( lonsdale et al . 1998a 1998b ) coincides with the position of the western nucleus . in a simplistic model of star formation occurring in an edge on disk",
    ", the rsn distribution would be expected to coincide with the nucleus . however ,",
    "if star formation is occurring throughout the disk and the nearside of the disk is tilted slightly to the south , as suggested by nicmos observations of arp  220 ( scoville et al .",
    "1998 ) , rsn in the near half of the disk would be more easily visible .",
    "in particular a moderate column density of ionized gas associated with the bulge - like component suggested by scoville et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and the longer path length to rsn on the far side of the disk would result in rsn radio emission being free - free absorbed .",
    "emission measures 1.1@xmath310@xmath55@xmath6  em  @xmath62.4@xmath310@xmath55  @xmath57  pc , corresponding to optical depths 1.2@xmath6  @xmath58  @xmath62.6 , would be required to free - free absorb emission from rsn with the same flux density at 1.67 ghz as those observed by slld98 , assuming a uniform screen of ionized absorbing gas with an electron temperature t@xmath59=10@xmath53  k. such emission measures compare well with those inferred from radio recombination line observations ( anantharamaiah et al .",
    "2000 ) which , however , suggest more complex models for the ionized gas than a single density uniform slab .",
    "alternatively , the rsn positional offset might be a consequence of positional uncertainty of the merlin observations ( see sect .",
    "[ sectionobservationspositions ] ) ; future observations are required to confirm the registration of merlin and vlba images .",
