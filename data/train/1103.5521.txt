    "like all the above cases , the spin wave dispersion also has some change in the intensity with the increasing of @xmath19 .",

    "<S> motivated by the discovery of new family 122 iron - based superconductors , we present the theoretical results on the ground state phase diagram , spin wave and dynamic structure factor of the extended @xmath0 heisenberg model . in the reasonable physical parameter region of @xmath1 , we find the block checkerboard antiferromagnetic order phase is stable . </S>",
    "<S> there are two acoustic branches and six optical branches spin wave in the block checkerboard antiferromagnetic phase , which has analytic expression in the high symmetry points . to compare the further neutron scattering experiments , we discuss the saddlepoint structure in the magnetic excitation spectrum and calculate the predicted inelastic neutron scattering pattern based on linear spin wave theory . </S>"
