    "the fundamental group @xmath0 of the menger universal curve @xmath1 contains an isomorphic copy of the fundamental group of every one - dimensional separable metric space @xcite and an isomorphic copy of the fundamental group of every planar peano continuum @xcite .",
    "all of these groups have recently come under renewed scrutiny ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while eluding concrete description by classical means .",

    "* thm  2.2 ) , but all of its finitely generated subgroups are free @xcite , suggesting that any object resembling a cayley graph should be tree - like .",

    "our word calculus is based on a representation of @xmath1 as the limit of an inverse sequence of certain finite 4-valent graphs @xmath4 ( see  [ sp ] and  [ edgelabels ] below ) , constituting a special case of pasynkov s classical construction @xcite .",
    "we choose these graphs so that each @xmath4 can be reinterpreted as the directed state graph of a variation on the classical towers of hanoi puzzle with @xmath5 disks ( see  [ th ] ) . in this way",
    ", we obtain a `` mechanical '' description of @xmath2 .",
    "the material is organized in such a way that the sections on the word calculus for @xmath2 and its generalized cayley graph ( see  [ map][caym ] ) can be read independently of the game interpretation .",
    "in fact , most aspects are presented both in terms of word sequences and in terms of disk movements .",
    "( _ references to the game are set in slanted typeface_. ) however , we hope that the reader who chooses to engage in the puzzle correspondence will gain better visual insight into the overall combinatorics , which are ultimately driven by the injection @xmath6 into the first ech homotopy group ( see  [ cech ] ) .",
    "we close with a brief discussion of a concrete embedding of the much - studied hawaiian earring into our model ( see   [ heemb ] ) .",
    "as we shall see , each graph @xmath4 naturally covers a bouquet of two directed circles @xmath7 and @xmath8 , allowing us to describe the set @xmath9 of based edge - loops in @xmath4 in terms of finite words over the alphabet @xmath10 .",
    "the topological bonding maps @xmath11 then induce combinatorial bonding functions @xmath12 . the reduced edge - loops ( reduced as words in the free group on @xmath13 ) are canonical representatives for the elements of @xmath14 and form a reduced inverse sequence @xmath15 whose limit is isomorphic to @xmath16 .",
    "the combinatorial description of @xmath2 then follows along the lines of @xcite : from the set of _",
    "reduced_-coherent word sequences in @xmath15 , we select only those which have eventually stable _ unreduced _ projections at every fixed lower level .",
    "the stabilizations of this selection of sequences form a group under the natural binary operation of termwise concatenation , followed by reduction and restabilization , and this group is isomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "the fact that all functions @xmath17 can be calculated by one and the same explicit formula ( see definition  [ phi ] and example  [ exproj ] ) allows us to present a systematic algorithm which , when randomized , outputs a generic element of @xmath2 ( see  [ algorithm ] ) .",
    "the generalized cayley graph of @xmath2 comprises an analogous ( stabilized ) selection of sequences of words describing edge - paths in @xmath4 that start at the base vertex , but do not necessarily end there , and it is turned into an @xmath3-tree using a recursive word length calculation ( see  [ caym ] ) .",
    "the group , which is a distinguished subset of this @xmath3-tree , acts freely on the @xmath3-tree by homeomorphisms in the same natural way , with quotient homeomorphic to @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , arcs in the @xmath3-tree which connect points corresponding to group elements naturally spell out word sequences that represent the group - theoretic difference of their endpoints . considering",
    "the underlying limitations discussed in @xcite , these features represent a best possible generalization of the concept of a classical cayley graph for @xmath2 .      _ in our version of the towers of hanoi , the placement of the disks is restricted to within the well - known unique shortest solution of the classical puzzle , while we allow for backtracking within this solution and for the turning over of any disk that is in transition .",
    "we color the disks white on one side and black on the other .",
    "then the state graph of this new `` puzzle '' is isomorphic to @xmath4 , with edges corresponding to situations where all disks are on the board and vertices marking the moments when disks are in transition .",
    "the exponents of the edge labels ( @xmath18 or @xmath19 ) indicate progress ( `` @xmath20 '' ) or regress ( `` @xmath21 '' ) in solving the classical puzzle ( we add a game reset move when the classical puzzle is solved ) and their base letters indicate whether the two disks to be lifted at the respective vertices of this edge are of matching ( `` @xmath7 '' ) or mismatching ( `` @xmath8 '' ) color .",
    "hence , each edge - path through @xmath4 corresponds to a specific evolution of this game , as recorded by an observer of the movements of the @xmath5 disks . _",
    "our word calculus can be modeled by aligning an entire sequence of such puzzles with incrementally more disks into an inverse system , whose bonding functions between individual games simply consist of ignoring the smallest disk . subsequently ,",
    "every combinatorial notion featured in the description of the generalized cayley graph has a mechanical interpretation in terms of this sequence of puzzles ( see  [ caym ] ) .",
    "in particular , the elements of @xmath2 are given by those coherent sequences of plays which return all disks to the base state , while all along making sure that any seemingly cancelling interaction among finitely many disks turns out not to cancel when the movements of sufficiently many additional disks are revealed ( see  [ visualization ] ) .",
