    "computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) simulations have been widely used in aerospace , mechanical , and chemical industries to support engineering design , analysis , and optimization .",
    "two decades ago when large eddy simulations ( les ) started gaining popularity with the increasing availability of computational resources , it was widely expected that les would gradually displace and eventually replace reynolds - averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) equations in industrial computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) work - flows for decades to come . in the past two decades , however , while les - based methods ( including resolved les , wall - modeled les , and hybrid les / rans methods ) did gain widespread applications , and the earlier hope certainly did not diminish , the predicted time when these methods would replace rans has been significantly delayed .",
    "this observation is particularly relevant in light of the recent discussions on the ending of the `` moore s law era '' with transistor sizes approaching their theoretical lower limit  @xcite .",
    "rans solvers , particularly those based on standard eddy viscosity models ( e.g. , @xmath0@xmath1",
    "@xcite , @xmath0@xmath2  @xcite , s  a  @xcite , and k@xmath2sst",
    "@xcite , are still and will remain the dominant tool for industrial cfd in the near future .",
    "this is likely to be true even in mission critical applications such as aircraft design .",
    "interestingly , even the advanced rans models such as reynolds stress transport models  @xcite and explicit algebraic reynolds stress models  @xcite have not seen much development in the past few decades .",
    "these advanced models are computationally more expensive and less robust compared to the standard eddy viscosity rans models . as such , it is still practically important to further develop the standard rans models for industrial cfd applications .",
    "however , improving the predictive capabilities of these models is critical yet technically challenging .",
    "while traditional development of turbulence models has focused on incorporating more physics to improve predictive capabilities , an alternative approach is to utilize data . in the past few years",
    ", a number of data - driven approaches have been proposed .",
    "researchers have investigated the use of both offline data ( i.e. , existing dns data for flows different from that to be predicted  @xcite ) and online data ( streamed monitoring data from the flow to be predicted  @xcite ) .",
    "dow and wang  @xcite used direct numerical simulation ( dns ) data from a plane channel flow to infer the full - field discrepancy in the turbulent viscosity @xmath3 modeled by the @xmath0@xmath2 model . to predict flows in channels with wavy boundaries , they modeled the ( log-)discrepancies of @xmath3 in the new flows as gaussian random fields , with the discrepancy field inferred above as mean .",
    "duraisamy and co - workers  @xcite introduced a full - field multiplicative discrepancy term @xmath4 into the production term of the transport equations of turbulent quantities ( e.g. , @xmath5 in the sa model and @xmath2 in the @xmath0@xmath2 models ) .",
    "they used dns data to calibrate and infer uncertainties in the @xmath4 term .",
    "it is expected that the inferred discrepancy field can provide valuable insights to the development of turbulence model and can be used to improve rans predictions in similar flows .",
    "xiao et al .",
    "@xcite used sparse velocity measurements ( online data ) to infer the full - field discrepancies @xmath6 in the rans - predicted reynolds stress tensors , or more precisely the physical projections thereof ( turbulent kinetic energy , anisotropy , and orientations ) . throughout this paper",
    "it is understood that @xmath7 indicates the physical projections and not the individual components of the reynolds stress tensor .",
    "good performance was demonstrated on several canonical flows including flow past periodic hills , flow in a square duct  @xcite , and flow past a wing  body junction  @xcite .",
    "all three approaches  @xcite discussed above can be considered starting points toward the same destination : the capability of predictive turbulence modeling by using standard rans models in conjunction with offline data .",
    "to this end , the respective discrepancies terms ( @xmath8 , @xmath4 , and @xmath6 ) are expected to be extrapolated to similar yet different flows .",
    "these contributions are all relatively recent and much of the research is still on - going .",
    "duraisamy et al .",
    "@xcite performed _ a priori _ studies to show the potential universality of their discrepancy term @xmath4 among a class of similar flows , but their performances in _ a posteriori _ tests , i.e. , using the calibrated discrepancy in one flow to predict another flow , have yet to be demonstrated .",
    "dow and wang  @xcite extrapolated the logarithmic discrepancies @xmath8 calibrated in the plane channel flow to flows in channel with slightly wavy walls , where velocity predictions were made .",
    "similarly , further pursuing the approach of xiao et al .",
    "@xcite , wu et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the reynolds stress discrepancy calibrated with sparse velocity data can be extrapolated to flows at reynolds number more than an order of magnitude higher than that in the calibration case .",
    "the extrapolated discrepancy has lead to markedly improved predictions of velocities and other quantities of interest ( qois ) , showing the potential of the approach in enabling data - driven predictive turbulence modeling .",
    "however , an intrinsic limitation in the approach of wu et al .",
    "@xcite is that they inferred the functions @xmath9 , or simply denoted as @xmath10 , in the space of _ physical coordinates _",
    "therefore , strictly speaking they only demonstrated that the discrepancy @xmath6 can be extrapolated to flows in the same geometry at the same location .",
    "consequently , their attempts of extrapolation to the flow in a different geometry ( e.g. , from a square duct to a rectangular duct ) encountered less success .",
    "the approach of dow and wang  @xcite would share the same limitation since they built gaussian random fields indexed by the physical coordinates @xmath11 .      a natural extension that overcomes the key limitation in the calibration ",
    "prediction approach of wu et al .",
    "@xcite is to build such functions in a space of well - chosen features @xmath12 instead of physical coordinates @xmath11 . despite its limitations , a key factor in the success of the original approach",
    "is that the reynolds stress discrepancies are formulated on its projections such as the anisotropy parameters ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and orientation ( @xmath15 ) of the reynolds stresses and not directly on the individual components .",
    "these projections are normalized quantities  @xcite .",
    "we shall retain this merits in the current approach and thus use data to construct functions @xmath16 instead of @xmath17 .",
    "this extension would allow the calibrated discrepancies to be extrapolated to a much wide range of flows .",
    "in other words , the discrepancies of the rans - predicted reynolds stresses can be quantitatively explained by the mean flow physics .",
    "hence , these discrepancies are likely to be universal quantities that can be extrapolated from one flow to another , at least among different flows sharing the same characteristics ( e.g. , separation ) . as such",
    ", discrepancies in reynolds stress projections are suitable targets to build functions for .    with the function targets identified ,",
    "two challenges remain : ( 1 ) to identify a set of mean flow features based on which the discrepancies functions @xmath16 can be constructed and ( 2 ) to choose a suitable method for constructing such functions .",
    "duraisamy and co - workers  @xcite identified several features and used neural network to construct functions for the multiplicative discrepancy term .",
    "ling and templeton  @xcite provided a richer and much more complete set of features in their pioneering work , and they evaluated several machine learning algorithms to predict point - based binary confidence indicators of rans models  @xcite .",
    "ling et al .  @xcite",
    "further used machine learning techniques to predict the reynolds stress anisotropy in jet - in - cross flows .",
    "based on the success demonstrated by ling and co - workers  @xcite , we will use machine learning to construct the functions @xmath16 in the current work . specifically",
    ", we will examine a class of supervised machine learning techniques , where the objective of the learning is to build a statistical model from data and to make predictions on a response based on one or more inputs  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to unsupervised learning , where no response is used in the training or prediction , and the objective is to understand the relationship and structure of the input data .",
    "unsupervised learning will be explored as an alternative approach in future works .",
    "the objective of this contribution is to present an approach to predict reynolds stress modeling discrepancies in new flows by utilizing data from flows with similar characteristics as the prediction flow .",
    "this is achieved by training regression functions of reynolds stress discrepancies with the dns database from the training flows .    in light of the consensus in the turbulence modeling community",
    "that the reynolds stresses are the main source of model - form uncertainty in rans simulations  @xcite , the current work aims to improve the rans modeled reynolds stresses . in multi - physics applications the qois might well be the reynolds stresses and/or quantities that directly depend thereon . in these applications",
    "the current work is significant by itself in that it would enable the use of standard rans models in conjunction with an offline database to provide accurate reynolds stress predictions .",
    "moreover , the improvement of reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed method is an important step towards a data - driven turbulence modeling framework .",
    "however , the reynolds stresses corrected by the constructed discrepancy function from dns databases can not necessarily guarantee to obtain improved mean flow fields .",
    "there are a number of challenges associated with propagating the improvement of reynold stresses through rans equation to the mean velocity field , which will be addressed in future works .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 introduces the components of the predictive framework , including the choice of regression inputs and responses as well as the machine learning technique used to build the regression function .",
    "section  3 shows the numerical results to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method .",
    "further interpretation of the feature importance and its implications to turbulence model development are discussed in section  4 .",
    "finally , section  5 concludes the paper .",
    "the overarching goal of the current and companion works is a physics - informed machine learning ( piml ) framework for predictive turbulence modeling . here ,",
    "`` physics - informed '' is to emphasize the attempt of accounting for the physical domain knowledge in every stage of machine learning .",
    "the problem targeted by the piml framework can be formulated as follows : given high - fidelity data ( e.g. , reynolds stresses from dns or resolved les ) from a set @xmath18 of @xmath19 training flows , the framework shall allow for using standard rans turbulence models to predict a new flow @xmath20 for which data are not available .",
    "the flows @xmath21 for which high - fidelity simulation data are available are referred to as _ training flows _ , and the flow @xmath20 to be predicted is referred to as _",
    "test flow_. the lack of data in test flows is typical in industrial cfd simulations performed to support design and optimization .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the training flows and the test flow have similar complexities and are dominated by the same characteristics such as separation or shock  boundary layer interaction .",
    "this scenario is common in the engineering design process , where the test flow is closely related to the training flows .",
    "ultimately , the envisioned machine learning framework will be used in scenarios where the training flows consist of a wide range of elementary and complex flows with various characteristics and the test flow has a subset or all of them .",
    "however , the latter scenario is much more challenging and is outside the scope of the current study .",
    "considering the proposed method is a completely new paradigm , we decide to take small steps by starting from the closely related flows and to achieve the overarching goal gradually .      in the proposed approach",
    "we utilize training data to construct functions of the discrepancies ( compared to the dns data ) in the rans - predicted reynolds stresses and use these functions to predict reynolds stresses in new flows .",
    "the procedure is summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "perform baseline rans simulations on both the training flows and the test flow .",
    "2 .   compute the feature vector field @xmath22 , e.g. , pressure gradient and streamline curvature , based on the rans - predicted mean flow fields for all flows .",
    "3 .   compute the discrepancies field @xmath23 in the rans modeled reynolds stresses for the training flows based on the high - fidelity data .",
    "4 .   construct regression functions @xmath24 for the discrepancies based on the training data prepared in step 3 .",
    "compute the reynolds stress discrepancies for the test flow by querying the regression functions .",
    "the reynolds stresses can subsequently be obtained by correcting the baseline rans predictions with the evaluated discrepancies .    in machine learning terminology",
    "the discrepancies @xmath6 here are referred to as _ responses _ or _ targets _ , the feature vector @xmath12 as _ input _ , and the mappings @xmath25 as _ regression functions_. a regression function @xmath26 maps the input feature vector @xmath12 to the response @xmath27 , and the term `` function '' shall be interpreted in a broad sense here . that is , depending on the regression technique used , it can be either deterministic ( e.g. , for linear regression ) or random ( e.g. , gaussian process )  @xcite , and it may not even have an explicit form . in the case of random forests regression used in this work  @xcite , the mapping does not have an explicit expression but is determined based on a number of decision trees .    in the procedure described above ,",
    "after the baseline rans simulations in step 1 , the input feature fields are computed in step 2 , the training data are prepared in step  3 , and the regression functions are constructed in step 4 .",
    "finally , the regression functions are evaluated to make predictions in step  5 .",
    "it is worth noting that in each stage domain knowledge is incorporated , e.g. , physical reasoning for identification of input features and consideration of realizability constraints of reynolds stress in learning - prediction process .",
    "each component is discussed in detail below .",
    "the choice of features and responses are presented in sections  [ sec : feature ] and  [ sec : discrepancy ] , respectively , and the machine learning algorithm chosen to build the regression function is introduced in section  [ sec : regression ] .      as has been pointed out in section  [ sec :",
    "intro ] , mean flow features are better suited as input of the regression function than physical coordinates as they allow the constructed functions to predict flows in different geometries .",
    "ling and templeton  @xcite proposed a rich set of twelve features based on clear physical reasoning .",
    "the set of features used in the present study mostly follow their work , except that we excluded the feature `` vortex stretching '' ( input 8 in table ii of ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "this feature is present only in three - dimensional flows , but the test cases presented here are two - dimensional flow .",
    "we excluded two additional features related to linear and nonlinear eddy viscosities ( features 6 and 12 in ref .",
    "these quantities were specifically chosen for evaluating qualitative confidence indicators of rans predictions and , in our opinion , are not suitable input for regression functions of reynolds discrepancies .",
    "finally , experiences in the turbulence modeling communities suggest that mean streamline curvature has important influences on the predictive performance of rans models  @xcite .",
    "therefore , curvature is included as an additional feature .",
    "the complete list of the mean flow features chosen as regression inputs in this work is summarized in table  [ tab : feature ] .    in choosing the mean flow features as regression inputs ,",
    "we have observed a few principles in general .",
    "first , the input and thus the obtained regression functions should be galilean - invariant .",
    "quantities that satisfy this requirement include all scalars and the invariants ( e.g. , norms ) of vectors and tensors .",
    "an interesting example is the pressure gradient along streamline ( see feature  @xmath28 in table  [ tab : feature ] ) . while neither velocity @xmath29 nor pressure gradient @xmath30 ( both being vectors ) is galilean - invariant by itself and thus is not a suitable input , their inner product @xmath31 is",
    "second , since the truth of the mean flow fields in the test flows are not available , an input should solely utilize information of the mean flow field produced by the rans simulations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , all of the adopted features are based on rans - predicted pressure @xmath32 , velocity @xmath33 , turbulent kinetic energy  @xmath0 , and distance @xmath34 to the nearest wall .",
    "finally , to facilitate implementation and avoid ambiguity , only local quantities ( i.e. , cell- or point - based quantities in cfd solvers ) of the flow field are used in the formulation of features , with the distance @xmath34 to nearest wall being a notable exception .",
    "this principle is similar to that in choosing variables for developing turbulence models  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of most feature variables are evident from the brief descriptions given in the table , but a few need further discussions .",
    "first , feature @xmath35 ( q - criterion ) is based on the positive second invariant @xmath36 of the mean velocity gradient @xmath37 , which represents excess rotation rate relative to strain rate  @xcite . for incompressible flows ,",
    "it can be computed as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are rotation rate and strain rate tensors , respectively ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with superscript @xmath43 indicating tensor transpose and tr indicating trace .",
    "the q - criterion is widely used in cfd simulations as a post - processing tool to identify vortex structures for the visualization of flow structures  @xcite .",
    "second , the wall distance based reynolds number @xmath44 in @xmath45 is an indicator to distinguish boundary layers from shear flows .",
    "this is an important feature because rans models behave very differently in the two types of flows .",
    "this quantity is frequently used in wall functions for turbulence models .",
    "third , feature @xmath46 defines the deviation from orthogonality between the velocity and its gradient  @xcite , which indicates the deviation of the flow from parallel shear flows ( e.g. , plane channel flows ) .",
    "since most rans models are calibrated to yield good performance on parallel shear flows , this deviation is usually correlated well with large discrepancies in rans predictions . however , since it only accounts for misalignment angle and not the velocity magnitude , in regions with near - zero velocities this quantity becomes the angle formed by two zero - length vectors and is thus mostly noise .",
    "finally , we remark that most of the features in table  [ tab : feature ] including the q - criterion and wall - distance based reynolds number are familiar to cfd practitioners .",
    "most of the features presented in table  [ tab : feature ] are formulated as ratios of two quantities of the same dimension , either explicitly ( @xmath35 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) or implicitly ( @xmath51 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "hence , they are non - dimensional by construction .",
    "features @xmath28 and @xmath46 involve inner product of vectors or tensors , and thus they are normalized by the magnitude of the constituent vectors or tensors . finally , feature @xmath52 ( streamline curvature ) is normalized by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the characteristics length scale of the mean flow , chosen to be the hill height @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flowgeo ] ) in the numerical examples .",
    "we followed the procedure of ling and templeton  @xcite to normalize the features . except for feature @xmath45 ,",
    "each element @xmath56 in the input vector @xmath12 is normalized as : @xmath57 where the summation on repeated indices is not implied , @xmath58 are raw values of the features , and @xmath59 are the corresponding normalization factors .",
    "this normalization scheme limits the numerical range of the inputs within @xmath60 $ ] and thus facilitates the regression .",
    "the normalization is not needed for feature @xmath45 ( wall distance based reynolds number ) since it is already in a non - dimensional form and in a limited range @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "it can be seen that the choices of features and normalization factors heavily rely on physical understanding of the problem ( turbulence modeling ) . that is , in the present data - driven modeling framework , the data are utilized only _ after _ physical reasoning from the modeler has been applied .",
    "this task can be a burden in certain applications .",
    "it is worth noting that the recent work of ling et al .",
    "@xcite aimed to relieve the modeler from such burdens by using a basis of invariants of tensors relevant in the specific application ( e.g. , strain rate @xmath40 in turbulence modeling ) .",
    "their work has the potential to systematically construct the input features based on raw physical variables and thus makes data - driven modeling even `` smarter '' .",

    "the response quantities should also be based on galilean invariant quantities due to the same consideration as in the feature choice . as such , individual components of",
    "the reynolds stresses or the discrepancies based thereon are not suitable , but those based on their eigenvalues or invariants are preferred . in turbulence modeling , the lumley triangle has been widely used for the analysis of turbulence states related to realizability  @xcite .",
    "it is formulated based on the second and third invariants ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) of the anisotropy tensor .",
    "recently , banerjee et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an improved formulation in which the eigenvalues of the anisotropy tensor are mapped to barycentric coordinates as opposed to the variants @xmath84 and @xmath85 as in the lumley triangle .",
    "an important advantage of their formulation is that the mapping to barycentric coordinates is linear , which is in contrast to the nonlinear mapping to invariants @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , barycentric coordinate provides a non - distorted visual representation of anisotropy and is easier to impose realizability constraints .",
    "the formulation of discrepancy starts with the eigen - decomposition of the reynolds stress anisotropy tensor @xmath86 : @xmath87 where @xmath0 is the turbulent kinetic energy , which indicates the magnitude of @xmath88 ; @xmath89 is the second order identity tensor ; @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] with @xmath92 are the orthonormal eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath86 , respectively , indicating its shape and orientation .    in the barycentric triangle , the eigenvalues @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95",
    "are mapped to the barycentric coordinates @xmath96 as follows :    [ eq : lambda2c ] @xmath97    with @xmath98 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bary ] , the barycentric coordinates of a point indicate the portion of areas of three sub - triangles formed by the point and with edges of barycentric triangle .",
    "for example , a point located on the top vertex corresponds to @xmath99 while a point located on the bottom edge has @xmath100 = 0 .",
    "similar to the lumley triangle , all realizable turbulences are enclosed in the barycentric triangle ( or on its edges ) and have positive barycentric coordinates @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath100 .",
    "the barycentric triangle has been used by emory et al .",
    "@xcite as a mechanism to impose realizability of reynolds stresses in estimating uncertainties in rans simulations .",
    "placing the triangle in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath103 , the location of any point within the triangle is a convex combination of those of the three vertices , i.e. , @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 denote coordinates of the three vertices of the triangle .",
    "an advantage of representing the anisotropy of reynolds stress in the barycentric coordinates is that it has a clear physical interpretation , i.e. , the dimensionality of the turbulence state  @xcite .",
    "typically , the standard - rans - predicted reynolds stress at a near wall location is located close to the isotropic , three - component state ( vertex 3c - i ) in the barycentric triangle , while the truth is near the two - component limiting states ( bottom edge ) .",
    "moreover , the spatial variations from the near - wall region to the shear flow region are indicated as arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : bary ] .",
    "it is clear that the trend of spatial variation predicted by a standard rans model is opposite to that of the truth .",
    "the three mutually orthogonal , unit - length eigenvectors @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 indicate the orientation of the anisotropy tensor . they can be considered a rigid body and thus its orientation has three degrees of freedom , although they have nine elements in total .",
    "we use the euler angle with the @xmath111@xmath112@xmath113 convention to parameterize the orientation following the convention in rigid body dynamics  @xcite .",
    "that is , if a local coordinate system @xmath114@xmath115@xmath111 spanned by the three eigenvectors of @xmath116 was initially aligned with the global coordinate system ( @xmath117@xmath118@xmath119 ) , the current configuration could be obtained by the following three consecutive intrinsic rotations about the axes of the local coordinate system : ( 1 ) a rotation about the @xmath111 axis by angle @xmath120 , ( 2 ) a rotation about the @xmath114 axis by @xmath121 , and ( 3 ) another rotation about its @xmath111 axis by @xmath122 .",
    "the local coordinate axes usually change orientations after each rotation .        in summary ,",
    "the reynolds stress tensor is projected to six physically interpretable , galilean invariant quantities representing the magnitude ( @xmath0 ) , shape ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , and orientation ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) .",
    "they are collectively denoted as @xmath7 .",
    "the truths of these quantities can be written as baseline rans predictions corrected by the corresponding discrepancy terms , i.e. ,    [ eq : delta ] @xmath123    the discrepancies ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , denoted as @xmath130 with @xmath131 ) in the six projections of the reynolds stress tensor are responses of the regression functions .",
    "we utilize data consisting of pairs of @xmath132 from training flow(s ) to construct the functions @xmath133 .",
    "it is assumed that the discrepancies in six quantities @xmath6 are independent , and thus separate functions are built for each of them .",
    "this simplification is along the same lines as that made in previous works  @xcite .      with the input ( mean flow features @xmath12 ) and responses ( reynolds stress discrepancies @xmath134 ) identified above , a method",
    "is needed to construct regression functions from training data and to make predictions based on these functions .",
    "supervised machine learning consists of a wide variety of such methods including k - nearest neighbors  @xcite , linear regression and its variants ( e.g. , lasso )  @xcite , gaussian processes  @xcite , tree - based methods ( decision trees , random forests , bagging )  @xcite , neural networks  @xcite , and support vector machine  @xcite , among others .",
    "a major consideration in choosing the regression method is the high dimensionality of the feature space , which is typically ten or higher in our application .",
    "the curse of dimensionality makes such methods as k - nearest neighbors , linear regression , and gaussian processes not suitable .",
    "secondary considerations , which we believe are also important for turbulence modeling applications , are the capability to provide predictions with quantified uncertainties as well as physical insights ( e.g. , on the importance of each of the features and their interactions ) . after evaluating a number of existing machine learning techniques in light of these criteria , we identified _ random forests _  @xcite as the optimal approach for our purposes , which is an ensemble learning technique based on decision trees .    in simple decision tree learning",
    ", a tree - like model is built to predict the response variable by learning simple if - then - else decision rules from the training data .",
    "decision trees have the advantage of being easy to interpret ( e.g. , via visualization ) and implement .",
    "they are also computationally cheap .",
    "however , they tend to overfit the data and lack robustness . that is , a small change in the training data can result in large changes in the built model and its predictions .",
    "random forests learning is an ensemble learning technique proposed by ho  @xcite and briemann  @xcite that overcomes these shortcomings of simple decision trees . since these techniques are generally not familiar to readers in the fluid dynamics community",
    ", here we use an illustrative example in the context of turbulence modeling to explain the algorithm .    a simple decision tree model is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : tree - schematic ] . for clarity",
    "we consider an input with only two features : pressure gradient @xmath135 ( normalized and projected to the streamline tangential ) and wall distance based reynolds number @xmath136 , as defined in table  [ tab : feature ] . it can be also interpreted as wall distance in viscous unit .",

    "for example , it is well known that a standard isotropic eddy viscosity model has the largest discrepancy when predicting anisotropy in the viscous sublayer ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "this is because the truth is located on the bottom , corresponding to a combination of one- or two - component turbulence , while a typical isotropic eddy viscosity model would predict an isotropic state located on the top vertex ( see fig .",

    "in contrast , far away from the wall within the outer layer ( @xmath140 ) , the rans - predicted anisotropy is rather satisfactory .",

    "the pressure gradient plays a more important role than in the outer and viscous layers .",
    "larger pressure gradients correspond to larger discrepancies , which can be explained by the fact that favorable pressure gradients ( negative @xmath135 values ) tend to thicken the viscous sublayer  @xcite , which leads to larger discrepancies in @xmath14 .",

    "however , by aggregating a large number of trees ( ideally with minimum correlation ) , the predictive performance can be significantly improved and , the overfitting can be largely avoided . in random forests",
    "an ensemble of trees is built with bootstrap samples ( i.e. , sampling with replacement ) drawn from the training data  @xcite .",

    "in contrast , in random forests , one can build each tree to its maximum depth by successive splitting the nodes until only one training data point remains on each leaf .",
    "while each individual tree built in this manner may suffer from overfitting and has large prediction variances , the use of ensemble largely avoids both problems .",
    "moreover , random forest regression is simple to use with only two free parameters , i.e. , the number @xmath143 of trees in the ensemble and the number @xmath144 of selected features . in this work we used an ensemble of @xmath145 trees and the a subset of features ( i.e. , @xmath146 ) to build each tree . as a standard practice in statistical modeling ,",

    "as the inaccuracy in modeled reynolds stresses is the dominant source of model - form uncertainty in rans simulations , the proposed method for improving rans - predicted reynolds stresses is an important step towards the goal of enabling predictive capabilities of rans models .",
    "moreover , the random forests regression technique adopted in this work can provide physical insights regarding the relative importance of mean flow features that contributed to the discrepancies in the rans predicted reynolds stresses .",
    "this information can be used to assist future model development in that developers can devise models that are aware of and correctly respond to these flow features . however , a number of challenges need to be tackled before the improved reynolds stresses can be used to predict more accurate quantities of interests that are needed in engineering design ( e.g. , draft and lift coefficients )",
