    "various phenomena associated with phase transitions at the early stage of the universe have been a subject of great interest in cosmology for two decades .",
    "these phase transitions of the universe is motivated from the symmetry breaking phenomenon in high energy particle physics .",
    "one of the decisive problems in high energy particle physics is how the model of unified theories can be tested .",
    "it is expected that the primary symmetry of unified theories is broken down at the early universe to yield the theories with lower symmetries .",
    "there is a possibility to test the model at the early stage of the universe .    to investigate unified theories ,",
    "much interest has been taken in clarifying the mechanism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking under the circumstance of the early universe .",
    "the dynamics of the strong coupling gauge theory may break the symmetry of the unified theories without introducing an elementary scalar field .",
    "this scenario is called as the dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "it is considered that the change of curvature or volume size of the universe may cause the dynamical symmetry breaking as the evolution of the universe proceeds .",
    "the studies of such effects on the symmetry breaking may help understanding unified theories and evolution of the early universe .",
    "many works have been done in this field . by using the weak curvature expansion",
    "it is found that the chiral symmetry is restored for a large positive curvature and that there is no symmetric phase in a spacetime with any negative curvature.@xcite in weakly curved spacetime it is pointed out that non - trivial topology for the fermion field may drastically change the phase structure of the four - fermion theory.@xcite the higher derivative and gauged four - fermion theories have also investigated in weakly curved spacetime.@xcite in some compact spaces , e.g. , de sitter space@xcite and einstein universe@xcite , the effective potential is calculated without any approximation for the spacetime curvature .",
    "it is observed to exhibit the symmetry restoration through the second order phase transition .",
    "however , in such compact spaces , it is not clear whether the symmetry restoration is caused by the curvature or finite size effect .",
    "an example of other simple compact space with no curvature is the torus universe .",
    "since the torus spacetime has only the finite size effect , then the investigation in this space will indicate which effects , curvature or finite size , is essential to restore the symmetry .",
    "we therefore investigate the dynamical symmetry breaking in compact flat space with non - trivial topology .",
    "let us briefly comment on the cosmological motivations to consider the torus universe .",
    "several astrophysicists have discussed the possibility of the torus universe @xcite , and recently the topology of the universe is argued by using the observational data of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies @xcite , which was detected by cobe dmr @xcite . assuming that our universe is the three - torus , they constrained the cell size of the torus . according to the results",
    ", the size would be larger than the present horizon scale .",
    "thus we do not know the topology of our universe at present .",
    "nevertheless , there are some cosmological motivations to consider compact flat space with non - trivial topology .",
    "first , quantum cosmologist have argued that small volume universe have small action , and are more likely to be created @xcite .",
    "in fact , it seems difficult to create an infinite volume universe in the context of quantum cosmology .",
    "second , the torus universe , in contrast to the compact @xmath3 universe , may have long lifetime because the curvature does not collapse the universe .    in this paper",
    "we make a systematic study of the dynamical symmetry breaking in compact flat space with non - trivial topology , assuming that the four - fermion theory is an effective theory which stems from more fundamental theory at gut era .",
    "the effective potential is calculated from the feynman propagator which depends on the spacetime structure .",
    "evaluating the effective potential , we investigate the dynamical symmetry breaking induced by the effect of the spacetime structure .",
    "the dynamical symmetry breaking in torus universe of space - time dimension , @xmath4 , is investigated in ref.@xcite . our strategy to evaluate the effective potential differs from that in ref.@xcite .",
    "our method starts from the feynman propagator in real space , then it can be easily applied to compact flat spaces with arbitrary topology for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we show a brief review of four - fermion theory in curved space .",
    "we then extend the formalism to a useful form in order to investigate the effective potential in compact flat space with nontrivial topology .",
    "in section 3 , we apply the formalism to a 3-dimensional spacetime with nontrivial spatial sector .",
    "4-dimensional case is investigated in section 4 .",

    "for this purpose we evaluate an effective potential for the field @xmath22 .",

    "the figure shows that the symmetric phase appears as @xmath101 become smaller beyond some critical values .",
    "thus as is expected from the results of @xmath4 , the effect of compactifying the space affects the phase structure , and the effect with the antiperiodic boundary condition for fermion fields always tends to restore the symmetry .",
    "we show the critical values @xmath160 ,",
    "i.e. , the value of @xmath101 when the symmetry is restored , as a function of cut - off parameter in fig.[fig : figcrta ] .",
    "we can read from the figure that smaller value of @xmath101 is needed in order to restore the symmetry of the aii - model compared with aaa - model .",
    "next we consider the fields with the periodic boundary condition , where the phase parameter is taken as @xmath161 . in the same way as the above ,",

    "the critical value of @xmath173 at large @xmath174 is same as that of pai - model all these models show the similar behavior in the subsection 3-b .    to end this section , we summarize the results .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the effective potential in the compactified space in four dimension .",
    "the effect of the compactification of the spatial sector changes the phase structure of the four - fermion theory .",
    "the consequent results on the effective potential comes up in different way according to the boundary condition of the fermion fields .",
    "the antiperiodic boundary condition tends to restore the symmetry and the periodic boundary condition does to break the symmetry , when the effect of the compact space becomes large .",
    "thus we can construct the both models that the symmetry is broken and restored in the course of the expansion of the universe .",
    "we have investigated the four - fermion theory in compact flat space with non - trivial topology . by using the effective potential and the gap equation in the leading order of the @xmath26 expansion we find the phase structure of the theory in three and four spacetime dimensions . in three dimensions three class of models",
    "are considered according to the variety of the boundary conditions for fermion fields .",
    "the phase structure of the theory is examined for three models when taking the antiperiodic boundary condition , the broken chiral symmetry tends to be restored for a sufficiently small @xmath101 .",
    "the phase transition is of the second order .",
    "when taking the periodic boundary condition , the chiral symmetry tends to be broken down for a small @xmath101 . in four dimensions",
    "we also see the same effects appears in the compact flat spaces",
    ".    therefore the drastic change of the phase structure is induced by the compact space with no curvature . in the torus space with the antiperiodic boundary condition",
    ", the finite size effect decreases the dynamical fermion mass and the chiral symmetry is restored for a small universe beyond some critical size ( @xmath181 ) . on the other hand , the torus space with the periodic boundary condition for fermion fields , the finite size effect causes the opposite influence to the phase structure .",
    "the dynamical fermion mass is increased as the size @xmath101 decreases and the chiral symmetry may be broken down for @xmath181 , even when we set symmetric phase at @xmath163 . in some cases only the broken phase is observed for any finite @xmath101 ( @xmath182 ) even if the coupling constant @xmath125 of the four - fermion interactions is sufficiently small .",
    "according to the behavior of the effective potential in section 3 , the value of the vacuum energy in the true vacuum becomes lower when the space size ( volume ) of the compactified direction becomes small in the model associated with the periodic boundary condition . on the contrary , for the model associated with the the antiperiodic boundary condition ,",
    "the value of the the vacuum energy in the true vacuum is raised , when the space size ( volume ) becomes small .",
    "therefore we find that the effect of the periodic boundary condition forces attractively ( negative pressure ) and that of antiperiodic boundary condition forces repulsively ( positive pressure ) .",
    "this fact resembles to the well known casimir effect @xcite , which is found in qed .",
    "the casimir effect gives rise to the vacuum pressure due to the effect of the finite volume .",
    "using the momentum space representation we understand these effects of boundary conditions in the following way . in the compactified space",
    "the momentum is discritized .",
    "the fermion fields with an antiperiodic boundary condition can not take a momentum smaller than ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "thus the possible momentum of the internal fermion fields becomes larger when @xmath101 becomes small .",
    "since the lower momentum fermion field has played an essential role to break the chiral symmetry , the vacuum expectation value of the composite operator @xmath184 disappears for a sufficiently small @xmath101 and the broken symmetry is restored .",
    "contrary to this the fermion fields with a periodic boundary condition can take a vanishing momentum even if the space is compact .",
    "hence the finite size of @xmath101 has no effect to restore the symmetry . in the compactified space",
    "the fermion field @xmath185 can interact with the field @xmath186 for a compactified direction .",
    "thus the finite size effect seems to make the interaction stronger .",
    "summing up all the correlations @xmath187 , the vacuum expectation value of the composite field becomes larger as @xmath101 decreases .",
    "we can understand it as the dimensional reduction .",
    "compactifying one direction to the size @xmath101 in @xmath16-dimensional space , it looks @xmath188-dimensional space for particles with compton wavelength much larger than the size @xmath101 . in the lower dimensional space",
    "the influence from the lower momentum fermion exceeds .",
    "then the finite size effect breaks the chiral symmetry for the model with the periodic boundary condition .    from the cosmological point of view , some mechanism , e.g. , inflation ,",
    "is needed to explain the hot and large universe . even in the torus universe",
    ", inflation seems to be needed to solve the horizon problem .",
    "as had been discussed in ref.@xcite , we need some special idea to lead inflation in the context of the dynamical symmetry breaking scenario . an inflation model which is induced by a composite fermion field in the context of the dynamical symmetry breaking scenario",
    "is investigated in some class of supersymmetric particle model @xcite .",
    "we will need further investigation to test the symmetry breaking in the early universe .",
    "in the present paper we have calculated the effective potential starting from the feynman propagator defined by eq.([defgf ] ) .",
    "the spacetime considered here reduces to the cylindrical universe @xmath189 for @xmath7 .",
    "the effective potential of the four - fermion theory in a cylindrical universe can be obtained by using another representation of the feynman propagator.@xcite to justify our method we calculate the effective potential ( [ def : v : topo ] ) in two dimensions and compare it with the result given in ref.@xcite .",
    "taking the two dimensional limit eqs.([vivren ] ) and ( [ exvfv ] ) read @xmath190 @xmath191\\ , , \\ ] ] respectively .",
    "eq.([epot : min:2d ] ) is exactly equal to the effective potential of gross - neveu model in two - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "thus the other part of the effective potential @xmath69 gives the finite size and topological effect also in @xmath189 . to compare the results with the one obtained by another method we change the expression of @xmath69 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath69 can be written as @xmath192 now we use the formula @xmath193 where the variable @xmath194 depends on the boundary condition and given by @xmath195 performing the summation in eq.(@xmath196 ) , the function @xmath197 reads @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the periodic delta function defined by @xmath200 to obtain ( [ app : i:2 ] ) we change the integration variable @xmath201 to @xmath202 . according to the property of @xmath199 eq.([app : i:2 ] ) can be represented in the following form @xmath203 where @xmath204 is given by @xmath205 substituting eq.([app : i:3 ] ) to eq.([d2:vfv ] ) , the integrand of the eq.([d2:vfv ] ) is modified as @xmath206\\ , .",
    "\\label{2d : vfv:2}\\ ] ] we can easily perform the integration over @xmath30 and find @xmath207    using the momentum space representation of the feynman propagator the effective potential of the gross - neveu model is given by @xmath208 in two - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "inserting eqs.([2d : vfv:3 ] ) and ( [ 2d : gn : app ] ) into eq.([def : v : topo ] ) the effective potential in @xmath189 reads @xmath209    in the case of the antiperiodic boundary condition eq.([v:2d : fine ] ) reproduces the result obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the field theory in @xmath189 is equivalent to the finite - temperature field theory . as is shown in ref.@xcite , the effective potential ( [ v:2d : fine ] ) is in agreement with that of the finite temperature four - fermion theory in @xmath7 with recourse to the relation between the size of the universe @xmath101 and the temperature @xmath210 @xmath211 with @xmath212 the boltzmann constant . in this case",
    "it is known that the broken chiral symmetry is restored for sufficiently small @xmath181 at the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "the critical size of the universe is given by @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the euler constant .",
    "it is equal to the well - known formula of the critical temperature for the gross - neveu model at finite temperature@xcite .    on the other hand",
    "the symmetric phase is not observed for any values of the coupling constant @xmath125 and @xmath101 in the case of the periodic boundary condition as is shown below .",
    "using the eqs .",
    "( a1 ) and ( a11 ) , the gap equation of the present theory is given by @xmath215=0\\ , .\\ ] ] if we take the limit , @xmath216 , we find that @xmath217 the derivative of the effective potential has a negative value at @xmath216 .",
    "thus the minimum of the effective potential is located at non - vanishing @xmath22 and the chiral symmetry is always broken down for the fermion field with periodic boundary condition irrespective of the value of the coupling constant @xmath125 .",
    "evaluating the effective potential numerically we see that the dynamically generated fermion mass becomes heavier as the size @xmath101 decreased .",
    "therefore the boundary condition change the finite size effect conversely also in two dimensions and our method agrees with the well - known results .",
