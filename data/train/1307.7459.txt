    "for the last few decades , one of most interesting topics is to study the dynamical evolution of an external perturbation around a black hole .",
    "it is widely believed that the quasinormal modes in the dynamical evolution carry the characteristic information about the black hole and could help us to identify whether there exists black hole in our universe or not @xcite .",
    "the further investigations imply that the quasinormal spectrum of black holes could open a window for us to understand more deeply about the quantum gravity @xcite and the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dynamical behaviors of the perturbations could be used to test the stability of a black hole in various theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of various perturbations have been studied extensively in the various black holes spacetime @xcite .",
    "all of the above investigations mentioned for the electromagnetic perturbation are in the frame of einstein - maxwell electromagnetic theory in which the maxwell lagrangian is only quadratic in the maxwell tensor and does not contain any coupling between the maxwell part and the curvature part .",
    "recently , a lot of attention have been focused on studying the generalized einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "the main motivation is that the generalized einstein - maxwell theory contains higher derivative interactions and carries more information about the electromagnetic field .",
    "the study of the generalized einstein - maxwell theory could help us to explore the full properties and effects of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "one of interesting generalized einstein - maxwell theory is born - infeld theory which is introduced in the thirties @xcite in order to remove the divergence of the electron s self - energy in the classical electrodynamics .",
    "moreover , born - infeld theory displays good physical properties concerning wave propagation such as the absence of shock waves and birefringence phenomena @xcite .",
    "born - infeld theory has also received special attention because it could arise in the low - energy regime of string and d - brane physics @xcite .",
    "another generalization of the einstein - maxwell theory with three parameters has been considered in which there are the non - minimal couplings between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the presence of such non - minimal couplings in the lagrangian modifies of the coefficients involving the second - order derivatives both in the maxwell and einstein equations , which could affect the propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in the spacetime and may yield time delays in the arrival of those waves @xcite .",
    "moreover , these couplings could modify the electromagnetic and gravitational structure of a charged black hole @xcite . in the evolution of the early universe",
    ", these coupled terms may yield electromagnetic quantum fluctuations and lead to the inflation @xcite .",
    "due to the inflation at that time , the scale of the fluctuations can be stretched towards outside the hubble horizon and then they result in classical fluctuations , which means that the non - minimal couplings could be used to explain the large scale magnetic fields observed in clusters of galaxies @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a simple generalized electromagnetic theory which involves a coupling between the maxwell field and the weyl tensor @xcite .",
    "in this theory , the lagrangian density of the electromagnetic field is modified as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the weyl tensor and @xmath0 is a coupling constant with dimensions of length - squared .",
    "@xmath4 is the electromagnetic tensor , which is related to the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath5 by @xmath6 .",
    "actually , the coupling in the lagrangian density ( [ lem ] ) is a special of coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields since weyl tensor @xmath3 is related to the riemann tensor @xmath7 , the ricci tensor @xmath8 and the ricci scalar @xmath9 by @xmath10\\nu}-g_{\\nu[\\rho}r_{\\sigma]\\mu})+\\frac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)}r g_{\\mu[\\rho}g_{\\sigma]\\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the dimension and metric of the spacetime , and brackets around indices refers to the antisymmetric part .",
    "it was found that the similar couplings between curvature tensor and maxwell tensor could be obtained from a calculation in qed of the photon effective action from one - loop vacuum polarization on a curved background @xcite .",
    "although weyl correction can be looked as an effective description of quantum effects , such kind of couplings may also occur near classical compact astrophysical objects with high mass density and strong gravitational field such as the supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the effects originating from such kind of couplings could also be used to distinguish between general relativity and other theories of gravity in the future astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can treat the weyl correction to electromagnetic field as a kind of general classical couplings between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields and study the effects of such correction on the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic field in the general background spacetime . the coupling term with weyl tensor",
    "is a tensorial structure correcting the maxwell term at leading order in derivatives , which modifies the einstein - maxwell equation and affects the dynamical evolution of electromagnetic field in the background spacetime .",
    "an advantage of this generalized electromagnetic theory with weyl correction is that the modified einstein - maxwell equation is not complicated and the equations of motion for electromagnetic perturbation can be decoupled to a second order differential equation , which is very important for us to investigate further the dynamical properties of electromagnetic perturbation in the black hole spacetime . in ref.@xcite , the authors studied the holographic conductivity and charge diffusion with weyl correction in the anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and found that the correction breaks the universal relation with the @xmath13 central charge observed at leading order .",
    "recently , the holographic superconductors with weyl corrections are also explored in @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the effects of weyl corrections @xmath14-wave holographic superconductor and found that with weyl corrections the critical temperature becomes smaller and the scalar hair is formed harder when the coupling constant @xmath0 is negative , but the result is just opposite when the constant @xmath0 is positive . in the stckelberg mechanism , it is found that weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 also changes the order of the phase transition of the holographic superconductor @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-wave holographic superconductor model with weyl corrections has been studied and it is shown that the effect of weyl corrections on the condensation is similar to that of the @xmath14-wave model @xcite . moreover",
    ", the effects of weyl corrections on the phase transition between the holographic insulator and superconductor has been investigated in @xcite and it is found that in this case the effects of weyl corrections depend on the model of holographic dual . for the @xmath15-wave model , the higher weyl corrections will make it harder for the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition to be triggered .",
    "however , for the @xmath14-wave model , the weyl couplings do not affect the properties of the holographic insulator / superconductor phase transition since the critical chemical potentials are independent of the weyl correction terms in this case .",
    "these results may excite more efforts to be focused on the study of the electrodynamics with weyl corrections in the more general cases .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the dynamical evolution of the electromagnetic perturbation coupling to the weyl tensor in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime and see the effect of the weyl corrections on the stability of the black hole .",
    "the plan of our paper is organized as follows : in the following section we will derive the master equation of electromagnetic perturbation with weyl correction in the four - dimensional static and spherical symmetric spacetime . in sec.iii , we will study numerically the effects of the weyl corrections on the quasinormal modes of the electromagnetic perturbation in the schwarzschild black hole and then examine the stability of the black hole .",
    "finally , in the last section we will include our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the effects of weyl corrections on the dynamical evolution of the electromagnetic perturbations in a black hole spacetime , we must first obtain its wave equation in the background .",

    "<S> our results show that the weyl correction parameter @xmath0 and the parities imprint in the wave dynamics of the electromagnetic perturbation . for the odd parity electromagnetic perturbation , we find it grows with exponential rate if the value of @xmath0 is below the negative critical value @xmath1 . however , for the electromagnetic perturbation with even parity , we find that there does not exist such a critical threshold value and the electromagnetic field always decays in the allowed range of @xmath0 .    </S>",
