    "the launch of the chandra observatory ( weisskopf 2000 ) in 1999 july has provided the first opportunity for detailed , spatially - resolved x - ray spectroscopy of clusters of galaxies at moderate to high redshifts . the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on chandra permits direct , simultaneous measurements of the x - ray gas temperature and density profiles in clusters and , via the hydrostatic assumption , the mass distributions , spanning scales from @xmath6 kpc in cluster cores out to @xmath7 mpc at the detection limits .    in this paper , we present the first results from chandra observations of rxj1347.5 - 1145 , the most x - ray luminous galaxy cluster known ( schindler 1995 ) .",
    "this cluster has been the subject of several previous x - ray , optical and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect studies ( schindler 1995 , 1997 ; fischer & tyson 1997 , allen 1998 ; komatsu 1999 , 2001 ; pointecouteau 1999 , 2001 ) . here , we present the first measurements of the x - ray temperature structure within the cluster and place tight constraints on the total mass distribution .",
    "we compare our results with those from strong and weak lensing analyses .",
    "a comparison of the chandra and sz results , and a determination of the hubble constant from the combined data sets , is presented elsewhere ( schmidt & allen 2002 , in preparation ) .    except where stated otherwise ,",
    "the cosmological parameters @xmath8=50 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are assumed . at the redshift of rxj1347.5 - 1145 ( @xmath11 ) ,",
    "an angular scale of 1 arcsec corresponds to physical size of 6.81 kpc in this cosmology .",
    "the chandra observations of rxj1347.5 - 1145 were carried out using the acis on 2000 march 05 and 2000 april 29 .",
    "the target was observed in the back - illuminated s3 detector and positioned near the centre of node-1 on ccd 7 .",
    "the light curves for both observations were of high quality with no strong background flares .",
    "the net good exposure times were 8.9 and 10.0 ks , respectively , giving a total good exposure time of 18.9 ks .",
    "the focal plane temperature at the time of both observations was -120c .",
    "we have used the ciao software and the level-2 events files provided by the standard chandra pipeline processing for our analysis . only those x - ray events with grade classifications of 0,2,3,4 and 6",
    "were included in our final cleaned data sets .",
    "the raw @xmath12 kev image of the central @xmath13 arcmin@xmath14 region of the cluster , from the combined 18.9 ks data set , is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : im1](a ) .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath15 arcsec@xmath14 , corresponding to @xmath16 raw detector pixels .",
    "[ fig : im1](b ) shows an adaptively smoothed contour plot of the same data , using the smoothing algorithm of ebeling , white & rangarajan ( 2002 ) .",
    "the images reveal a number of notable features .",
    "firstly , we see a sharp central surface brightness peak at a position 13h47m30.63 -11d45m09.3s ( j2000 . ) , in good agreement with the optical centroid for the dominant cluster galaxy , 13h47m30.5 -11d45m09s ( j2000 . ; schindler 1995 ) .",
    "secondly , we identify a region of enhanced emission @xmath17 arcsec to the southeast of the x - ray peak ( see below ) .",
    "thirdly , on large scales ( @xmath18 arcsec ) we detect an extension of the x - ray isophotes to the south .    fig .",
    "[ fig : im2 ] shows the data for the central regions of the cluster on a finer @xmath19 arcsec@xmath14 scale ( corresponding to @xmath20 raw detector pixels ) . from this figure",
    "it appears that the region of enhanced emission to the southeast of the x - ray peak has a roughly circular morphology with a flattened northwest edge . beyond this edge , at a radius @xmath6 arcsec , the x - ray subclump appears to be separated from the main cluster core by a valley of reduced emission .",
    "the spectral analysis in section 4.2 shows that the x - ray subclump has a hotter temperature than the gas at the same radius in other directions from the x - ray peak and probably contains shocked gas resulting from a recent subcluster merger event .",
    "komatsu ( 2001 ) report the detection of a region of enhanced sz effect at a position coincident with the x - ray subclump .",
    "the enhanced sz effect is consistent with the higher temperature and density for this region measured from the chandra data .",
    "no strong x - ray point sources are detected in the chandra s3 field .",
    "( the brightest point source has a flux of @xmath21 in the @xmath22 kev band ; gandhi , in preparation . )",
    "the azimuthally - averaged , @xmath12 kev x - ray surface brightness profile for rxj1347.5 - 1145 for position angles of @xmath23 degrees ( i.e. excluding the southeast quadrant ) and for the disturbed , southeast quadrant are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : surbri](a , b ) , respectively .",
    "the profiles have been flat - fielded and background subtracted using an on - chip region free from cluster emission .",
    "the bin - size is 2 detector pixels ( 0.984 arcsec ) .",
    "we see that the data for position angles of @xmath23 degrees appear regular and , for @xmath24 kpc , can be approximated ( @xmath25 for 72 degrees of freedom ) by a @xmath26-model ( jones & forman 1984 ) of the form @xmath27^{1/2 - 3\\beta}$ ] with a core radius @xmath28 kpc and a slope parameter @xmath29 ( @xmath30 errors ) .",
    "between radii of @xmath31 mpc we find evidence for a steepening of the surface brightness profile with increasing radius : for @xmath32 mpc the data can be described ( @xmath33 for 131 degrees of freedom ) by a simple broken power - law model , with a break at a radius of @xmath34 kpc , and slopes in the regions internal and external to the break radius of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "a similar result was obtained for abell 2390 by allen , ettori & fabian ( 2001b ) , although in that case the slope interior to the break radius was flatter .    the data for the southeast quadrant containing the x - ray subclump reveal a clear excess of emission relative to other directions .",
    "enhanced emission is detected between radii of @xmath37 kpc , with a maximum enhancement of a factor @xmath38 at a radius @xmath39 kpc .",
    "for our spectral analysis , we have separated the southeast quadrant containing the x - ray subclump from the rest of the cluster .",
    "the data for position angles of @xmath23 ( the relaxed part of the cluster ) were divided into the annular regions detailed in table 1 .",

    "fig : im2 ] is most obvious . ]",
    "a single spectrum was extracted for each region in 1024 pulse invariant ( pi ) channels .",
    "the spectra were re - grouped to contain a minimum of 20 counts per pi channel thereby allowing @xmath40 statistics to be used .",
    "background spectra , appropriate for the regions studied , were extracted from the acis - s3 blank - field data sets provided by maxim markevitch ( which are available from the chandra x - ray center ) .",
    "separate photon - weighted response matrices and effective area files were constructed for each region using the available calibration and response files appropriate for the -120c focal plane temperature .",
    "pixel@xmath14 sub - region of the s3 chip , a spectral response ( .rmf ) and an auxiliary response ( .arf ) matrix were created using the ciao tools @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . for each of the annular regions studied , the number of source counts in each @xmath43 pixel@xmath14 sub - region was determined .",
    "the individual .rmf and .arf files were then combined using the ftools programs @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( using a script provided by roderick johnstone ) to form a counts - weighted spectral response and auxiliary response matrix appropriate for each annulus . ]",
    "the data from both chandra observations were modelled simultaneously using the xspec code ( version 11.01 ; arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "we have limited our analysis to the @xmath22 kev energy band , over which the calibration of the back - illuminated ccd detectors is currently best understood .",
    "the spectra have been modelled using the mekal plasma emission code of kaastra & mewe ( 1993 ; incorporating the fe l calculations of liedhal , osterheld & goldstein 1995 ) and the photoelectric absorption models of balucinska - church & mccammon ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have fitted each annular spectrum using a simple , single - temperature model with the absorbing column density fixed at the nominal galactic value ( @xmath46 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "the free parameters in this model were the temperature ( @xmath47 ) , metallicity ( @xmath48 ; measured relative to the solar photospheric values of anders & grevesse 1989 , with the various elements assumed to be present in their solar ratios ) and emission measure .",
    "we note that including the absorbing column density as an additional free parameter did not result in significant improvements in the goodness of fit .",
    ".the results from the analysis of the annular spectra ( covering position angles @xmath23 degrees ) .",
    "temperatures ( @xmath47 ) are in kev and metallicities ( @xmath48 ) in solar units .",
    "the absorbing column density has been fixed at the nominal galactic value of @xmath49 .",
    "the total @xmath40 values and number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) in the fits are listed in column 4 .",
    "error bars are the @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) confidence limits on a single interesting parameter . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     having adjusted the parameters for the second mass component to produce the northern arc , we then examined whether the resulting mass model can explain the other arcs observed by sahu ( 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , there are no measured redshifts for the other arcs .",
    "( sahu 1998 note a possible lower limit for arc 4 of @xmath52 based on the non - detection of [ oii ] in their ground - based spectra , although they caution that the arc may simply be a galaxy without a strong emission - line feature ) .",
    "the details of our model predictions are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ rxjmodel ] .",
    "the results on the predicted arc redshifts and the assumed sizes of the sources are listed in table  [ arcredshifts ] .",
    "the predicted redshifts are cosmology dependent and would be modified slightly if , for example , an accelerating universe with a different hubble constant were assumed . for the mass model used here , the predicted redshifts should be accurate to @xmath53 , with the exception of arc 4 which is determined more precisely .",
    "we have modelled the lensed galaxies using circular gaussian brightness distributions with the full - width - at half - maximum ( fwhm ) values listed in table  [ arcredshifts ] .",
    "the fwhms for the arcs were adjusted so that their 30 per cent brightness contours provide a good fit to the stis data .",
    "the effects of using different source sizes is illustrated by the different brightness contours in fig .",
    "[ rxjmodel ] .",
    "although we include arc 2 in our modelling , we caution that this source appears quite red in the colour image published by fischer & tyson ( 1997 ) and that it is possible that the source is simply an edge - on spiral galaxy .",
    "the predicted redshift for arc 2 is lower than @xmath54 , since otherwise the lens model would predict a much stronger distortion .",
    "arcs 3 , 4 and 5 are consistent with being at the same redshift .",
    "the projected separation of the sources producing arcs 4 and 5 is 43.4 @xmath55 kpc .",
    "although arcs 4 and 5 have a similar colour in the data of fischer & tyson ( 1997 ) , it is not possible to explain them as images of the same source using our mass model . in exploring different redshifts for arc 3",
    ", we found that for redshifts higher than @xmath56 it is possible to produce a counter image on the other side of the central galaxy .",
    "this alerted us to the presence of a blue object ( identified from the colour image of fischer & tyson 1997 ) to the south - east of the merging subclump ( see the arrow in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ rxjmodel ] ) .",
    "however , both the appearance in the stis image and our lensing analysis suggest that these objects are not images of the same source .",
    "we note that circular nfw models for one or both of the main mass components can not explain the observed arc shapes and orientations well . in particular , the orientation of arc 4 reflects the orientation of the critical curve ( fig .",
    "[ rxjmodel ] ) in its vicinity .",
    "a small @xmath57 difference between the orientation of the observed and predicted arc 4 remains in our best - fit model , which points to a small imprecision of the lensing model .",
    "the grey circle in fig .  [ fig : weak ] shows the azimuthally - averaged , surface mass density contrast at @xmath58 kpc ( centred on the main mass component ) for the best - fit strong lensing model .",
    "note that the strong lensing results should lie above the x - ray results at the same radii , since the chandra analysis excludes the regions of the cluster affected by the second mass subclump .",
    "the surface mass density contrast rises sharply between the innermost weak lensing point and the strong lensing result , suggesting that the second mass component is centrally concentrated and does not make a major contribution to the total mass beyond the strong lensing regime .",
    "in conclusion we find that a simple two - component mass model , with ellipticities and orientations for the mass components matching those of the dominant cluster galaxies , provides a reasonable description for the overall arc geometry in rxj1347.5 - 1145 .",
    "such a model is consistent with the chandra x - ray and weak lensing results .",
    "the results on the electron density and cooling time as a function of radius , determined from the image deprojection analysis using the best - fit nfw mass model , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deproj ] . within the central 500 kpc radius ,",
    "the electron density profile can be parameterized ( @xmath59 for 34 degrees of freedom ) by a @xmath26-profile with a core radius , @xmath60 kpc , @xmath61 and a central density , @xmath62 @xmath63 ( @xmath50 errors ) .",
    "we measure a central cooling time ( _ i.e. _ the mean cooling time within the central 1.97 arcsec ( @xmath64 kpc ) bin of @xmath65 yr ( uncertainties are the 10 and 90 percentile values from 100 monte carlo simulations ) .      the x - ray gas - to - total - mass ratio as a function of radius , @xmath66 , determined from the chandra data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : baryon ] .",
    "we find that the best - fit @xmath67 value rises rapidly with increasing radius within the central @xmath68 kpc radius and then remains approximately constant , or rises slowly , out to the limits of the data at @xmath69 mpc where we measure @xmath70 .",
    "following the usual arguments , which assume that the properties of clusters provide a fair sample of those of the universe as a whole ( white & frenk 1991 ; white 1993 ; white & fabian 1995 ; evrard 1997 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ) , we may use our results on the x - ray gas mass fraction to estimate the total matter density in the universe , @xmath71 . assuming that the luminous baryonic mass in galaxies in rxj1347 - 1145 is @xmath72 of the x - ray gas mass ( white 1993 ; fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) and neglecting other possible sources of baryonic dark matter in the cluster",

    ", we can parameterize the luminosity profile in terms of an equivalent mass deposition rate ( white 1997 ) .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot ] .",
    "we see that the integrated mass deposition rate ( mdr ) rises with increasing radius within the central 100 kpc , to a maximum value of @xmath80 .",
    "we have examined the spectrum for the central 100 kpc ( radius ) region using a model appropriate for a cooling flow with distributed mass deposition .",
    "( we use the model of nulsen 1998 and assume that the integrated mdr within radius @xmath81 , @xmath82 . ) the normalization of the cooling - flow component is parameterized in terms of a mass deposition rate , @xmath83 .",
    "the cooling flow was also allowed to be absorbed by an intrinsic column density , @xmath84 , of cold gas ( with solar metallicity ) located at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "both @xmath83 and @xmath85 were free parameters in the fits .",
    "accounting for projection effects , we find that the @xmath22 kev spectrum for the central 100 kpc radius region is consistent with a cooling flow of @xmath86 , intrinsically absorbed by a column density of @xmath87 , with a mean mass - weighted flow temperature of @xmath88 kev .    fitting the mass deposition profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdot ]  with a broken power - law model , we determine a break radius of @xmath89 kpc , and slopes internal and external to the break radius of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively ( @xmath50 errors ) .",
    "allen ( 2001a ) argue that such breaks may mark the outer edges of the present - day cooling flows in clusters .",
    "the predicted mdr for the central @xmath92 kpc radius , where a steady cooling flow with gas cooling to zero degrees might be expected to occur , is @xmath93 .",
    "the cooling time of the x - ray gas at the break radius is @xmath94 yr .",
    "as discussed in section 4.2 , the region of enhanced x - ray emission ( and enhanced sz effect ; komatsu 2001 ) to the southeast of the main x - ray peak is significantly hotter ( @xmath95 kev ) than at the same distance in other directions ( @xmath96 kev ) .",
    "following markevitch ( 1999 ) , we can model the properties of this region as a one - dimensional shock . in this case",
    ", the relative velocity , @xmath97 , of the infalling subcluster and the shock compression factor , @xmath98 , can be estimated from the pre - shock ( @xmath99 ) and post - shock ( @xmath100 ) temperatures . for @xmath101 kev and @xmath102 kev",
    ", we obtain @xmath103  and @xmath104 .",
    "if we instead adopt @xmath105 kev , a temperature consistent with the predicted mass of the merging subcluster from the strong lensing analysis discussed in section 6.2 ( using the mass - temperature relation of allen 2001c ) , then for @xmath102 kev we obtain @xmath106  and @xmath107 .",
    "we note that the roughly spherical appearance of the shocked gas suggests that this material has expanded following the initial shock .",
    "since the material will cool as it expands , it is likely that the initial post - shock temperature exceeded 18 kev and , for @xmath105 , that the relative collision velocity exceeded 5000 .",
    "such values are broadly consistent with the peak x - ray surface brightness enhancement of a factor @xmath38 observed at a radius of @xmath108 kpc .",
    "the second brightest galaxy in the cluster lies approximately 18 arcsec to the east and 2 arcsec to the south of the dominant cluster galaxy .",
    "this galaxy has an extended , diffuse halo and appears to lie at the centre of a significant sub - concentration of galaxies within the cluster ( fig .",
    "[ rxjmodel]a ) .",
    "these properties are consistent with it having been the dominant galaxy of the recently merged subcluster .",
    "the region of shocked x - ray gas lies approximately 11 arcsec to the south and 6.5 arcsec to the west of the second brightest galaxy .",
    "assuming that the dark matter and galaxies associated with the subcluster have moved on ahead of the shock , it seems plausible that the subcluster travelled in from a pa of @xmath109 degrees .",
    "this is consistent with the extension of the x - ray emission observed on large scales to the south ( fig .",
    "[ fig : im1]b ) and the weak lensing mass map presented by fischer & tyson ( 1997 ) . given the separation of the shocked gas and second brightest galaxy , we estimate that the shock probably occurred a few @xmath110 years ago .",
    "this timescale is consistent with the spatial extent of the shocked gas , assuming that it has expanded at the sound speed , @xmath111 .",
    "note also that this timescale is comparable to the time required for the electrons and ions to reach equipartition , so it is possible that the electron and ion populations in the shocked gas have slightly different temperatures .    despite the evidence for shocked gas in the southeast quadrant , the chandra data for the rest of the cluster place rxj1347.5 - 1145 on the @xmath112 and @xmath113 relations for relaxed , massive clusters discussed by allen , schmidt & fabian ( 2001 ) .",
    "as discussed in section 4.4 , the shocked gas produces only a small rise in the mean , emission - weighted temperature measured within the central 0.74 mpc radius .",
    "the excess bolometric luminosity of the southeast quadrant between radii of 60 - 195 kpc ( where the shock is most apparent ) is @xmath114 , which corresponds to only @xmath115 per cent of the total cluster luminosity ( section 4.4 ) .",
    "it therefore appears that the overall temperature and luminosity of the cluster have not been boosted substantially by the merger event .",
    "this is supported by the consistent x - ray and weak lensing mass results discussed in section 6.1 .",
    "ricker & sarazin ( 2001 ) and ritchie & thomas ( 2002 ) discuss simulations of mergers between clusters with similar central densities and argue that such mergers can lead to significant short - term increases in the overall x - ray temperatures and luminosities of clusters during the periods of closest approach .",
    "these effects are most pronounced and long - lived in clusters with relatively low central densities ( @xmath116 few @xmath117@xmath63 ; ritchie & thomas 2002 ) . the fact that large boosts in the overall temperature and luminosity are not observed in rxj1347.5 - 1145 may be related to the very high central density in the main cluster core ( @xmath118@xmath63 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : deproj]a ) and could indicate that the recently - merged subcluster had a relatively low central gas density and interacted only weakly with the main cluster core .",
    "recently , cohen & kneib ( 2002 ) have published spectroscopic redshift measurements for 47 cluster members for which they determine a velocity dispersion of @xmath119 .",
    "inspection of their fig .",
    "2 suggests that a significant fraction of the galaxies with measured redshifts may have been associated with the recently merged subcluster .",
    "this could explain the relatively low velocity dispersion , in comparison to the x - ray and lensing results .",
    "the agreement between the chandra x - ray and gravitational lensing mass measurements for rxj1347.5 - 1145 reinforces the results and conclusions drawn from previous studies of other relaxed lensing clusters abell 2390 ( allen 2001b ) and abell 1835 ( schmidt 2001 ) ; see also the results for ms1358.4 + 6245 by arabadjis ( 2002 ) .",
    "the close agreement of the independent x - ray and lensing masses indicates that the mass measurements are robust and limits the contributions from non - thermal sources of pressure support in the x - ray gas , such as bulk and/or turbulent motions and magnetic fields , in the relaxed regions of the cluster .",
    "the main conclusions from this work may be summarized as follows : 0.2 cm    \\(i ) we have reported chandra observations of rxj1347.5 - 1145 , the most x - ray luminous cluster of galaxies known .",
    "we have identified a region of shocked gas ( enhanced x - ray brightness and temperature ) to the southeast of the main x - ray peak , at a position consistent with the region of enhanced sz effect reported by komatsu ( 2001 ) .",
    "the shocked gas probably results from recent subcluster merger activity .",
    "the merger appears not to have boosted the overall luminosity and temperature of the cluster substantially .",
    "\\(ii ) excluding the data for the southeast quadrant , we have measured the density , temperature and mass profiles for the cluster",
    ". the mass profile can be parameterized by an nfw model with a scale radius @xmath120 mpc and a concentration parameter , @xmath121 ( 68 per cent confidence limits ) .",
    "the normalization of the mass profile may also be expressed in terms of an effective velocity dispersion , @xmath122 .",
    "\\(iii ) the best - fit chandra mass model for rxj1347.5 - 1145 is in good agreement with independent measurements from weak gravitational lensing studies ( fischer & tyson 1997 ) . the observed strong lensing configuration in the cluster core can also be explained with the introduction of an additional mass clump centred on the second brightest galaxy , which is likely to have been the dominant galaxy of the recently merged subcluster .",

    "<S> the mass profile for the relaxed regions of the cluster , determined under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , can be parameterized by a navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) model with a scale radius @xmath4 mpc and a concentration parameter @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit chandra mass model is in good agreement with independent measurements from weak gravitational lensing studies . </S>",
    "<S> strong lensing data for the central regions of the cluster can be also explained by the introduction of an additional mass clump centred on the second brightest galaxy . </S>",
