    "lattice qcd is now established as a precision tool for ` gold - plated ' hadron physics  @xcite , enabling us both to test qcd to high accuracy but also to use it to determine parameters of the standard model such as quark masses and ckm matrix elements .",
    "figure  [ fig : goldspect ] shows the current status of hpqcd lattice calculations of the masses of gold - plated mesons .",
    "these are mesons which are far from strong decay thresholds and whose masses can then be accurately determined both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the lattice calculations are done including the full effect of sea @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks ( using the milc collaboration gluon configurations ) and at multiple values of the lattice spacing so that systematic errors from working on a space - time lattice can be removed as far as possible , and a full error budget worked out .",
    "a lot of the gold - plated mesons contain valence @xmath6 or @xmath7 quarks .",
    "whilst work continues on @xmath8 , @xmath9 and related mesons there has been a lot of recent progress on mesons containing @xmath6 quarks , and i report on that here .",
    "one of the key issues in charm physics is to test lattice qcd against experiment as a precursor to using accurate lattice qcd results for @xmath9 physics along with experiment to determine key ckm elements .",
    "we now have a 2% accurate lattice qcd calculation of the decay constants of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons  @xcite and the recent experimental updates on this from cleo - c have thrown up an interesting picture .",
    "this is discussed in section 2 .",
    "further theoretical tests of our charm methods have led to a 1% accurate determination of the charm quark mass , using methods pioneered in continnum qcd  @xcite , and this is discussed in section 3 .",
    "in continuum qcd both charm and bottom quarks are described as heavy because their masses are significantly greater than the qcd scale , @xmath10 , of a few hundred mev .",
    "special techniques can be applied to heavy quarks because they are nonrelativistic in their bound states and @xmath11 is relatively small .",
    "this is important information that can be applied to handling @xmath7 quarks in lattice qcd also . for @xmath6 quarks it turns out not to be nearly so useful because the charm quark",
    "mass in lattice units , @xmath12 , is not that large for values of the lattice spacing currently in use , and will get even smaller as we make finer and finer lattices .",
    "we believe that a better strategy for @xmath6 quarks is to treat them in the same way as light @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 quarks .",
    "this allows us to make use of light quark symmetries of the ( lattice ) qcd lagrangian so that , for example , the annihilation rate of pseudoscalar mesons can be directly calculated without the need for a renormalisation constant .",
    "we can also apply standard variance reduction technqiues and find then that lattice statistical errors for @xmath13 mesons are as small ( less than 1% ) as those for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the worry , however , with @xmath6 quarks , is that @xmath12 is still quite large and this means that @xmath12 will set the scale for discretisation errors that appear as a result of having a finite lattice spacing .",
    "although these can be extrapolated away with multiple values of the lattice spacing , a large extrapolation will lead to a large resulting error .",
    "typically we would expect , for some quantity @xmath16 , to obtain a result at non - zero lattice spacing , @xmath17 , that behaves as : @xmath18 for @xmath19 0.1fm , @xmath20 and @xmath21 terms could lead to a 20% error .",
    "these are present in most light quark actions ( where they do not cause a big problem ) .",
    "we designed an action in which these terms were not present so that errors of only a few percent would be made even for @xmath6 quarks , and once extrapolations were made to zero lattice spacings any remaining errors would be very small .",
    "the action is based on the improved staggered quark action used for sea quarks in the milc configurations , and is called the highly improved staggered quark action ( hisq )  @xcite .      a lattice calculation proceeds by generating sets of gluon fields that are ` typical snapshots of the vacuum ' .",
    "the milc collaboration now have many such sets of gluon fields at 5 different values of the lattice spacing including the full effect of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 sea quarks using the improved staggered quark formalism  @xcite .",
    "we have used @xmath6 and light valence hisq quarks on these gluon configurations to calculate correlators for @xmath5 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 mesons . by studying the correlators as a function of lattice timein the large time limit",
    ", we can then calculate the masses of these mesons and the decay amplitude known as the decay constant .",
    "this is defined in pure qcd as @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and is the probability that the quark and antiquark are in the same place to annihilate to a @xmath24 boson . when calculated in qcd",
    ", it takes into account all the strong interactions that keep the quark and antiquark bound into the meson .",
    "the quark masses need to be fixed in any qcd calculation and we do this by adjusting them until the @xmath5 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 meson masses are correct . the last two require extrapolation in the @xmath25 quark mass ( the sea and valence masses",
    "are chosen to be the same ) using chiral perturbation theory because the lattice calculation has to be done at @xmath25 masses that are larger than the physical values . @xmath3 and @xmath4 masses have no further free parameters and we obtain values for them in agreement with experiment and with 6 mev errors ( again after extrapolation in the @xmath25 mass to the physical point )  @xcite .",
    "this is a very strong test both of our control of discretisation errors and of qcd itself because it shows that charmonium and charm - light systems , with very different dynamics , are simultaneously described a single qcd lagrangian .",
    "the rate for annihilation to a @xmath26 ) is proportional to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the appropriate ckm element .",
    "our results for @xmath29 mesons can be used , with experimental rates , to determine @xmath30 to 0.6%  @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay constants have 2% errors and can be compared to experimental determinations obtained by dividing the leptonic rate by known values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "following our calculations the results from the experiment have become very exciting this year , as shown in figure  [ fig : fds ] .",
    "a new result for @xmath33 from cleo - c  @xcite agrees well with our result , but values for @xmath34 do not .",
    "the discrepancy there amounts to 3@xmath35 where @xmath35 comes from experiment because our error is so small .",
    "this has led to speculation of new physics  @xcite , since the disagreement is a serious one and is the only such disagreement from the 15 or so quantities that have now been accurately calculated in lattice qcd and compared to experiment , see figure  [ fig : goldspect ] .",
    "final results from cleo - c on @xmath34 should reduce the error bars further and either confirm , or not , this hypothesis .",
    "meanwhile , we have continued to test our control of lattice systematic errors by calculating vector ( e.g. @xmath36 ) electromagnetic decay rates and hyperfine splittings such as @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these are in good agreement with experiment and we are finalising error budgets for them .",
    "future work aims at few percent errors for semileptonic form factors for @xmath39 for comparison with experiment .",
    "we have developed , in collaboration with continuum qcd theorists , a new method for determining heavy quark masses .",
    "so far we have applied this to determine @xmath40 to 1% and the agreement between our result for the mass in the @xmath41 scheme at 3 gev , 0.986(10 ) gev  @xcite , and the result obtained by analogous continuum techniques , 0.986(13 ) gev  @xcite , is another strong test of our control of systematic errors in handling charm quarks in lattice qcd .",
    "lattice qcd calculations encompass energy scales from low - energies and long - distances ( which we use to extract hadron masses ) to relatively high - energies set by the inverse of the lattice spacing .",
    "these high - energies are well into the perturbative regime and we make use of this , for example , in the accurate determination of @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "our charmonium ( @xmath5 or @xmath36 ) correlators are also perturbative at short lattice times , before the ground state meson dominates ( and we extract the ground state meson mass ) .",
    "we can access this perturbative region by taking time - moments , @xmath43 , of the correlator , g(t ) .",
    "extrapolation of these to the continuum allows them to be compared to continuum qcd perturbation theory which should be accurate for small enough values of @xmath44 and is known in some cases up to and including @xmath45 terms .",
    "the analogous continuum calculation  @xcite effectively determines correlator moments in the vector case from @xmath46 in the charm region .",
    "our calculation in the vector ( @xmath36 ) case agrees with experiment but our most accurate result , quoted above , comes from the pseudoscalar ( @xmath5 )  @xcite .",
    "the determination of @xmath40 from the more conventional lattice method of converting the bare lattice mass to the @xmath41 scheme using lattice qcd perturbation theory , agrees well with this result  @xcite .",
    "the accurate results for @xmath40 can be leveraged into an accurate result for light quark masses by determining ratios such as @xmath47 from which renormalisation constants between the lattice and the continuum cancel  @xcite .",
