    "a direct consequence of the inherent probabilistic nature of measurement outputs and state superposition of the quantum world is the existence of correlations that can not be explained through a classical description .",

    "it is still missing , however , a comparative study dedicated to contrast the way different correlations are transported in a chain of coupled quantum systems .",
    "the present work is dedicated to this matter .",
    "this kind of study recognizes that a fundamental requisite to perform quantum communication is precisely the ability to move information / correlations around quantum systems , and tries to use this paradigm to compare different correlations as propagation is involved .",
    "the propagation of entanglement through harmonic networks is one of the few examples which are well explored in the literature in @xcite .",
    "notably , in @xcite a useful scheme for high efficiency entanglement propagation , under unitary dynamics ( closed system ) , is developed for a linear chain .",
    "the proposed method consists of minimal adjustments of frequencies and coupling constants to boost the efficiency .",
    "the result is that the chain is transformed in a quantum bus able to distribute entanglement among quantum systems coupled to it . to understand this result ,",
    "a simple yet accurate model obtained using the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) is employed . in @xcite ,",
    "symplectic tools are used to generalize this approach and to arrive at an effective and accurate simple description suitable for arbitrary topologies ( beyond linear chains ) and open system dynamics ( interaction with environment ) .",
    "the main goal of our present work is to apply the system described in @xcite to the study of transport of different quantum correlations , not only entanglement .",
    "we are interested , for instance , in how an intrinsically asymmetric correlation such as quantum steering propagates .",
    "it is well known that given a state of a composed system @xmath0 , steering @xmath1 may be different than steering @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "how does this difference show up in a propagation problem ?",
    "for our knowledge , it is the first time steering is studied under this perspective .",
    "additionally , we do not restrict our investigation to entanglement and steering as we also include propagation of discord @xcite , mutual information @xcite and bell - like nonlocality @xcite to end up with a broad view of the propagations of quantum correlations using a quantum bus .",
    "we also include the action of thermal baths to mimic the effects of losses during the transmission of the correlations .",
    "for that , we apply the method developed in @xcite to arrive at an effective description of the system dynamics which allowed us to obtain physically relevant analytical expressions to explain the main features of the propagation problem . numerical solutions of the exact equations of motion are also always employed to support the validity of the analytical treatment .",
    "the question of how such different types of correlation propagate in a chain of coupled quantum systems is by itself a question of theoretical relevance .",

    "( [ bell2 ] ) .",
    "we consider the case of unitary evolution ( already discussed ) and two initial preparations . in one case ,",

    "[ fig2ent1 ] , [ fig3steer1 ] and [ figsteer2 ] .",
    "this is expected from the well - known hierarchy discussed earlier and presented in @xcite . by increasing the thermal energy in oscillator @xmath3 , it comes to a point at which the correlations are not enough to violate local realism .",
    "this is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig13bell1 ] .",
    "it is interesting to see that the setup still works efficiently to propagate the correlations .",
    "the interaction with thermal baths does not bring much new physics for the propagation of this kind of correlation .",
    "as before , it is progressively destroyed on a time scale @xmath207 .",
    "this destructive effect is expected , giving the fact that @xmath215 depends on wigner functions , whose deleterious impact , as consequence of the action of thermal baths , is well known .",
    "we provided a detailed study of the problem of propagation of correlations through a system of coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "we considered propagation in the closed system scenario as well as in the presence of heat reservoirs .",
    "in addition , we studied the effect of having initially pure or mixed entangled states or even non entangled mixed states with non - null discord .",
    "the presence of thermal excitations in the system was also investigated .",
    "we chose a particular configuration to this study which is well known to be reducible to a three - body system .",
    "this allowed us to provide analytical results that were useful for understanding the rich behavior found in the propagation of different correlations .",
    "we could , for instance , spot fundamental differences in the dynamical behavior of steering and discord , which are quantities that can be defined in non equivalent ways in the same bipartite system .",
    "it is important to remark that we performed simulations for a variety of chain lengths @xmath6 ( smaller or bigger than the one considered here ) and the same qualitative behavior was found .",
    "of course , @xmath6 can not be deliberately increased since this brings the chain spectrum to a continuum what spoils the transfer considerably .",

    "we hope this work can motivate further investigation in other setups , such as the ones found in coupled quantum electrodynamic systems , in which two - level systems can couple with harmonic oscillators , forming polarons .",
    "another possibility is to use more intricate topologies of coupled systems using the general simplification approach presented in @xcite",

    "<S> we study the propagation of different types of correlations through a quantum bus formed by a chain of coupled harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> this includes steering , entanglement , mutual information , quantum discord and bell - like nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> the whole system consists of the quantum bus ( propagation medium ) and other quantum harmonic oscillators ( sources and receivers of quantum correlations ) weakly coupled to the chain . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in using the point of view of transport to spot distinctive features displayed by different kinds of correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we found , for instance , that there are fundamental differences in the way steering and discord propagate , depending on the way they are defined with respect to the parties involved in the initial correlated state . </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed both the closed and open system dynamics as well as the role played by thermal excitations in the propagation of the correlations . </S>"
