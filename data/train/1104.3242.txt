    "when an elastic wave propagates in a metal , a perturbation of its electron subsystem occurs which compensates the tendencies of the ionic displacements to disrupt the charge neutrality or the balance between the ion and electron currents . at high temperatures or in dirty samples ( the so - called local limit , determined by the condition @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the acoustic wave vector and @xmath3 is the electron mean free path ) the electron collision frequency is high enough to maintain local equilibrium at any point of the deformed lattice . in the limit @xmath4",
    "( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the sound velocity and fermi velocity ) the electric field arising in the metal has a purely inertial nature  the acoustic analog of the stewart ",
    "tolman effect .    in the opposite limiting case ( @xmath7 , nonlocal limit )",
    "the collisions can no longer maintain local equilibrium , and additional electric fields are produced in the metal , bringing about the required adjustment of the electrons to the moving lattice . in zero magnetic field the polarization of the electric field of an elastic wave propagating in an isotropic metal or along a high - symmetry direction is parallel to the ionic displacements .",
    "when a magnetic field is turned on , the lorentz force exerted on the electrons moving with the lattice gives rise to a hall component of the alternating electromagnetic field , the existence of which is no longer dependent on strict requirements on the purity or temperature of the sample .",
    "the opposite process also occurs : the generation of acoustic vibrations when a polarized electromagnetic field is excited in the metal in a suitable way . on the whole , these phenomena  the acoustoelectric and electroacoustic transformations ",
    "are well known and widely used both in scientific experiments and for contactless excitation of sound in technical applications ( see , e.g. , the review@xcite ) .",
    "however , as far as the authors are aware , the experimental studies have always been done for electromagnetic fields in which the electric field vector was orthogonal to the wave vector of the elastic wave.@xcite the latter is apparently due to the fundamental differences in the behavior of the fields of transverse and longitudinal polarization at the interface between the metal and free space ( or an insulating medium ) . for normal incidence of a transverse elastic mode on the interface the electromagnetic field in the metal",
    "is naturally `` matched '' with the electromagnetic field in the vacuum ( insulator ) .",
    "in other words , in this geometry an electromagnetic wave is radiated from the metal ; this wave can easily be detected by a suitably oriented antenna of the flat - coil type .",
    "this same antenna can also be used to generate a transverse elastic wave in the metal .",
    "an electromagnetic wave with electric field polarized along the wave vector does not exist .",
    "therefore , in the case of normal incidence of a longitudinal acoustic wave on the interface , electromagnetic radiation from the sample is absent in principle . nevertheless , it is possible to detect the electric field @xmath8 due to a longitudinal acoustic wave . since @xmath9 in a longitudinal wave , uncompensated charge and the accompanying potential",
    "appear both in the bulk of the metal and on its surface.@xcite this potential can be detected by a voltmeter of suitable sensitivity .",
    "one of the authors ( v.m.g . )",
    "long ago had analyzed a method of linear electroacoustic conversion with the use of a contactless capacitive driver.@xcite here , when an alternating voltage is applied to the exciting plate of the capacitor , an electric charge is induced beneath it on the surface of the metal , and the nonlocal interaction of this charge with the lattice excites a longitudinal elastic wave of the same frequency .",
    "a detailed experimental check of ref .   has not been made , possibly because of the rather stringent requirements on the purity of the metal .",
    "the limiting case of a capacitive driver ( receiver ) is a galvanic contact , which is what was mainly used in the present study .",
    "finally , the presence of the contact on the interface alters the boundary conditions for the elastic deformations ; however , it turns out that the latter leads to a slight increase in the conversion efficiency and in general relaxes the requirements on the purity of the material under study .",
    "for this reason it is possible to carry out an experiment on practically all reasonably pure metals provided that some relatively simple requirements are met as to the nonlocality of the interaction of the electrons with the elastic field ( @xmath10 .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 a theory of the acoustoelectric conversion is given for the simplest case  a conducting half space ( one - dimensional problem ) in the approximation of an isotropic dispersion relation for the carriers and their `` specular '' reflection by the interface .",
    "the electric potential accompanying an elastic wave in the metal is a sum of two contributions .",
    "besides the well - known forced solution , which repeats the profile of the elastic deformations , in the nonlocal limit there is also a substantial quasiperiodic term due to the perturbation of the ballistic motion of the electrons by the surface of the sample .    in sec .",
    "3 we present the results of experimental studies of the temperature dependence of the aforementioned electric potential in metals of different degrees of purity ( ga , w , al ) in the normal state . on the whole , the temperature dependences of the amplitude and phase of the potential show an acceptable qualitative agreement with the theoretical estimates ; this can be regarded as experimental confirmation of the theoretical ideas proposed here .    in sec .",
    "4 we discuss the evolution of the measured electric potential at the superconducting transition .",
    "contrary to the expectation of a rather slow decrease in the recorded value below @xmath11 ( like the behavior of the longitudinal sound attenuation coefficient ) , a much sharper decrease in the amplitude of the potential is observed .",
    "let us consider a metallic half space @xmath12 .",
    "suppose that a longitudinal elastic wave @xmath13 comes in from the interior of the sample and is reflected from the sample boundary with a reflection coefficient @xmath14 ( we neglect the sound attenuation ) .",
    "near the boundary the displacement field and the deformation field are formed as a result of the interference of the incident and reflected waves , independently of the regime ( pulsed or continuous ) .",
    "the resultant field is expressed in terms of the amplitudes of the displacement @xmath15 and deformation @xmath16 at the interface . in particular , for the deformation field that we will be interested in below we have @xmath17 the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath16 is determined by the boundary conditions @xmath18    for a contact with an elastically uniform , nonattenuating medium the parameter @xmath19 is equal to the ratio of the acoustic impedances of the metal and of the medium in contact with it ( in particular , @xmath20 for a contact with the vacuum ) . in the case of an attenuating medium",
    "the parameter @xmath19 can be complex - valued .",
    "the deformation - induced deviation @xmath21 of the electron distribution function from its equilibrium value @xmath22 is described by the kinetic equation@xcite ( we neglect the inertial field ) : @xmath23 here @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the angular frequency , and @xmath26 is the electronic relaxation time ) , @xmath27 is the corresponding component of the deformation potential tensor @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the `` bare '' deformation potential , @xmath30 is the electric potential in the field of the elastic wave , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 component of the fermi velocity @xmath6 of the electron , and the angle brackets denote averaging over the fermi surface with a weight @xmath33 : @xmath34 it is important to note that the quantity @xmath35 appearing in eq.(3 ) is actually the total electrochemical potential of the electrons , including , in addition to the `` true '' electric potential , the change of the chemical potential @xmath36 due to the change of the electron spectrum in the elastic deformation field.@xcite the difference of the electrochemical potentials at different points of the sample is a source of real emf that can be registered by a voltmeter , and it , of course , vanishes at equilibrium , e.g. , in the limit of a static deformation ( @xmath37 ) . at the same time , the gradient of the `` true '' electric potential , which compensates the deformation contribution to the electrochemical potential and brings about an adjustment of the electron density to the spatial variations of the ion density is always nonzero in a nonuniformly deformed sample ( physically this effect is analogous to a contact potential difference ) .",
    "the presence of this potential in a nonuniformly deformed metal ( including in the elastic field of a sound wave ) gives rise to uncompensated charges with a density @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total electron density , @xmath2 is the characteristic wave number of the deformation , and @xmath40 is the screening radius of the longitudinal field ( @xmath41 , which in `` good '' metals is of the order of the lattice constant .",
    "such a `` charge density wave '' accompanying the propagation of a sound wave in the general case contains a nonequilibrium contribution due to the disruption of the spatial uniformity of the electrochemical potential @xmath35 ; this contribution is proportional to the frequency of the sound ( see below ) but in the majority of cases it is small ( @xmath42 compared to the `` adiabatic '' component mentioned above . to avoid misunderstandings",
    "we should say that , because of the small value of the uncompensated charge ( @xmath43 the potential @xmath30 can , of course , be calculated from the condition of electrical neutrality @xmath44 , where @xmath45 has the meaning of a nonequilibrium admixture to the charge density which is `` adiabatically '' modulated by the elastic field .",

    "it can be solved relatively simply by the fourier method if the so - called specular boundary condition is imposed on the function @xmath50 : @xmath51 we emphasize that the condition of `` specular '' reflection from the moving boundary can be written in the form ( 4 ) only in a comoving reference frame , in which there is no current through the boundary ( @xmath52 ) , and the scattering of the electrons is elastic . since the potential measurement is actually done at a moving boundary , all of the calculations below pertain to the comoving system , in which the form ( 3 ) of the linearized kinetic equation is preserved .",

    "we find @xmath180 in the case of longitudinal sound the vector potential in ( 17 ) can be dropped , and we obtain for the electric potential @xmath181 it follows from ( 19)(21 ) that the contribution @xmath166 to the periodic component of the potential is small in the parameter @xmath178 and can also be dropped , and the relation between the amplitudes of the potential and the normal ( @xmath39 ) and superconducting ( @xmath182 ) states has the form @xmath183 i.e. , the @xmath2 contribution should fall off with decreasing temperature in the same way as the sound attenuation coefficient .",
    "in addition , it follows from ( 22 ) that the phase of the potential should not change on transition through @xmath11 .",
    "since the @xmath70 component of the potential is also due to the deformation interaction , there is no reason to think that its law of variation will be substantially different from ( 22 ) .",
    "the experimental results presented in fig .  [ f6 ] strongly contradict the estimates given above . even in al ,",
    "in which apparently only the periodic component of the signal is present to a significant degree , the amplitude of @xmath71 changes much more sharply than @xmath184 , and the phase undergoes a rather rapid rise .",
    "these features are more pronounced in ga , in which one might suspect a manifestation of some sort of nonlinearity , since a nonlinearity is expressed quite clearly in the sound attenuation.@xcite for an excitation intensity close to the maximum , nonlinear behavior of @xmath71 was indeed observed , associated with both overheating and a sharp drop in the sound attenuation coefficient below @xmath11 , with a corresponding decrease in the heat release . the data presented in fig .  [ f6]a pertain to the region of amplitudes in which these effects are practically absent ( inset in fig .",
    "[ f6]a ) .    the following `` simplified '' line of reasoning is also possible . in the experiments described ,",
    "the potential difference between the `` hot '' spot and the remote parts of the sample is recorded in the regime of spreading surface currents .",
    "therefore , the value of the potential that is registered can depend on the spreading resistance .",
    "in other words , in a superconductor the rapid growth of the diamagnetic contribution to the conductivity ( @xmath185 can lead to `` short - circuiting '' of the source of the electromotive force , and that is what is detected in the experiment . in fig.[f6 ] we also show the signal taken from the asymmetric coil , which registered the amplitude and phase of the spreading currents specifically .",
    "we see that the amplitude of this signal falls off just as rapidly as does @xmath137 , and the phase also increases practically in a jump",
    ". therefore , from the standpoint of the `` simplified '' explanation a rapid growth of the `` resistance '' of the source of emf must also be assumed , and that is hard to imagine .    from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ f6]a for ga we see that beyond the region of very rapid drop of @xmath137 comes a more gradual `` tail , '' reminiscent of the evolution of @xmath186 ) .",
    "this suggests another hypothesis : for some reason that we have not discussed , the @xmath70 contribution in a superconductor actually vanishes very rapidly , and the remaining @xmath2 contribution falls off as follows from the theory .",
    "we recall , however , that the phase of the @xmath2 contribution is different from the phase of the @xmath70 contribution by more than @xmath0 ( fig.[f3]b ) , and so this scenario should be accompanied by a downward phase jump of corresponding amplitude .",
    "the data of fig .",
    "[ f6]b are inconsistent with this hypothesis as well .    at present",
    "the authors do not have any reasonable explanation for the described behavior of @xmath71 near @xmath11 . on the whole",
    ", the picture looks as if either a state in which an uncompensated charge can not exist develops with catastrophic rapidity in a superconductor which is found in the normal phase , at least in the nonlocal limit , or else below @xmath11 the electric potential just as rapidly transforms to a quantity that can not be measured by a voltmeter .",
    "we add that a jump in the phase of @xmath71 by approximately @xmath187 can be evidence that the surface impedance has some relation to the observed effect , since the penetration depth of the field at the transition through @xmath11 changes from a complex quantity with approximately equal real and imaginary parts ( their relative sizes depend on whether the normal or anomalous skin - effect regime is realized ) to the purely real london penetration depth .",
    "in summary , we have carried out a theoretical analysis and experimental observation and study of the electric potential arising when a longitudinally polarized elastic wave is incident normally on a metal surface .",
    "the potential under study is the sum of two contributions .",
    "the first of them , the @xmath2 contribution , is due to forced oscillations of the electric field , which is proportional to the elastic deformation @xmath188 , i.e. , it can be detected only on a non - free boundary , where @xmath155 .",
    "the second , @xmath70 contribution is due to the presence of the metal boundary itself , which distorts the ballistic motion of nonequilibrium carriers in a subsurface layer of thickness @xmath189 ; its amplitude turns out to be proportional to the displacement of the surface , @xmath15 . in the nonlocal limit the amplitude of the @xmath70 contribution is markedly greater than that of the @xmath2 contribution , while in the local limit it is the other way around .",
    "the phase of the @xmath70 contribution leads the phase of the @xmath2 contribution by approximately @xmath190 , and therefore in the crossover region the phase of the recorded potential varies quite sharply .",
    "the experimental observation of just such behavior is , in the opinion of the authors , an unambiguous qualitative confirmation of the correctness of the ideas developed in this paper about the origin of the potential in question .    at the superconducting transition",
    "the amplitude of the potential falls in a catastrophically rapid manner , and the phase just as rapidly increases by approximately @xmath187 .",
    "this behavior is inconsistent with the theoretical concepts , which predict a much smoother decrease of the amplitude , close to the bcs dependence of the longitudinal sound attenuation coefficient , and the absence of any phase variations .",
    "the authors express their deep gratitude to e. a. masalitin for invaluable contribution to the development and preparation of the measuring apparatus , which was ideally suited for addressing the problems investigated in this study .",
    "this is not strictly accurate .",
    "applications of electroacoustic conversion often make use of the circumstance that in a quasistatic electric field the surface of a conductor is subjected to an additional pressure . in an alternating field",
    "this pressure excites elastic displacements of the surface , including longitudinal ones .",
    "this effect is widely used in low - frequency acoustic experiments with vibrating reeds,@xcite and it is also the basis of the esat ( electrostatic acoustic transformation ) mechanism.@xcite.since the response is quadratic in the field amplitude , in this case the reciprocity principle is , of course , not obeyed , and this effect can be used for acoustoelectric conversion only with additional `` linearization '' . in the present paper",
    "we discuss only linear effects .",
    "we note that for the customary way of representing the elastic field [ @xmath191 $ ] , in comparing the measured phase variations with those calculated using relation ( 13 ) , the sign of the latter should be changed ."
