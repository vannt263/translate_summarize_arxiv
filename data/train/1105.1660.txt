    "we study bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) in hadronic @xmath4  decay using data collected by the l3  detector at an e@xmath5e@xmath6   center - of - mass energy of @xmath7 .",
    "approximately 36 million like - sign pairs of well - measured charged tracks from about 0.8 million hadronic z decays are used  @xcite .",
    "events are classified as two- or three - jet events using calorimeter clusters with the durham jet algorithm with a jet resolution parameter @xmath8 , yielding about 0.5 million two - jet events .",
    "there are few events with more than three jets , and they are included in the three - jet sample . to determine the thrust axis of the event we also use calorimeter clusters .",
    "the two - particle correlation function of two particles with four - momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 is given by the ratio of the two - particle number density , @xmath11 , to the product of the two single - particle densities , @xmath12 .",
    "since we are interested only in bec , @xmath12 is replaced by @xmath13 , the two - particle density that would occur in the absence of bec , yielding @xmath14 .",
    "an event mixing technique is used to construct @xmath15 .",
    "since the mass of the identical particles of the pair is fixed , @xmath16 is defined in six - dimensional momentum space , which is often reduced to a single dimension , @xmath17 .",
    "but there is no reason to expect the hadron source to be spherically symmetric in jet fragmentation .",
    "in fact , the source is found to be elongated along the jet axis  @xcite , but only by about 25% , which suggests that a parametrization in terms of the single variable @xmath18 , may be a good approximation .",
    "this is also suggested by studies of various decompositions of @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "with a few assumptions , @xmath16 is related to the fourier transform , @xmath19 , of the ( configuration space ) density distribution of the source , @xmath20 : @xmath21                      \\left(1 + \\delta q \\right ) \\;.\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath22 and the @xmath23 term are introduced to parametrize possible long - range correlations not adequately accounted for in @xmath15 , and @xmath24 to account for several factors , such as lack of complete incoherence of particle production and presence of long - lived resonance decays .",
    "model - independent ways to study deviations from the gaussian are to expand @xmath19 about a gaussian using the edgeworth expansion or to replace @xmath25 by a symmetric lvy distribution .    both the symmetric lvy ( fig .",
    "1a ) and the edgeworth parametrizations do a fair job  @xcite of describing the region @xmath26 , but fail at higher @xmath18 , particularly the region 0.61.5where @xmath16 dips below unity , indicative of an anti - correlation .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath44 , and ( b ) an average @xmath38-dependence , which is implemented by introducing an effective radius , @xmath45 , defined by @xmath46 this results in @xmath47 ( 1 + \\epsilon q ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is related to @xmath45 by @xmath49 fits of eq.([eq : asymlevr2 ] ) are first performed with @xmath48 as a free parameter .",
    "the fits for both two- and three - jet events have acceptable confidence levels ( cl ) , and describe well the dip in the 0.61.5  region , as well as the peak at low values of @xmath18 .",
    "the estimates of some fit parameters are rather highly correlated .",
    "for example , for two - jet events the estimated correlation coefficients from the fit for @xmath39 , @xmath45 and @xmath50 are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . taking the correlations into account ,",
    "the fit parameters satisfy eq.([eq : asymlevrar ] ) , the difference between the left- and right - hand sides of the equation being less than 1 standard deviation for two - jet events and about 1.5 standard deviations for three - jet events .",
    "no significant long - range correlation is observed : @xmath54 is zero within 1 standard deviation , and fits with @xmath54 fixed to zero find the same values , within 1 standard deviation , of the parameters as the fits with @xmath54 free .",
    "thus the method to remove non - bose - einstein correlations in the reference sample is apparently successful .",
    "fits are also performed imposing eq.([eq : asymlevrar ] ) .",
    "the result for two - jet events is shown in fig .",
    "1b . for two - jet events ,",
    "the values of the parameters are comparable to those with @xmath50 free . for three - jet events , the imposition of eq.([eq : asymlevrar ] ) results in values of @xmath39 and @xmath45 closer to those for two - jet events , but the @xmath55 is noticeably worse , though acceptable , than with @xmath50 free . also , the values of @xmath54 differ somewhat from zero , which could indicate a slight deficiency in the description of bec similar to , but on a much smaller scale , the edgeworth and symmetric lvy fits .    for two - jet events , @xmath34 , while for three - jet events the situation is more complicated .",
    "we therefore limit fits of eq.([eq : levyr2a ] ) to the two - jet data . for each bin in @xmath18",
    "the average values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are calculated , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the transverse masses of the two particles making up a pair , requiring @xmath58 .",
    "using these averages , eq.([eq : levyr2a ] ) is fit to @xmath59 .",
    "the fit yields @xmath60  fm , and we have re - fit with @xmath40 fixed to zero .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "the parameters @xmath39 , @xmath41 and @xmath24 are highly correlated with estimated correlaton coefficients @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "since the @xmath0-model  describes the @xmath43  dependence of @xmath16 , its parameters , @xmath39 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 , should not depend on @xmath43 .",
    "however , @xmath24 , which is not a parameter of the @xmath0-model , but rather a measure of the strength of the bec , can depend on @xmath43 .",
    "the large correlation between the fit estimates of @xmath24 , @xmath39 , and @xmath41 complicate the testing of @xmath43-independence .",
    "we perform fits in various regions of the @xmath56-@xmath57 plane keeping @xmath39 and @xmath41 fixed at the values obtained in the fit to the entire @xmath43  plane .",
    "the regions are chosen such that the numbers of pairs of particles in the regions are comparable .",
    "the @xmath43  regions and the cls of the fits are shown in fig.[fig : mtmt ] .",
    "the cls are reasonably uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "the data are thus in agreement with the hypothesis of @xmath43-independence of the parameters of the @xmath0-model .",

    "the @xmath0-model  predicts that the two - particle bec correlation function @xmath16 depends on the two - particle momentum difference only through @xmath18 , not through components of @xmath18 .",
    "however , previous studies  @xcite have found that @xmath16 does depend on components of @xmath18 and indeed that the shape of the region of homogeneity is elongated along the event ( thrust ) axis .",
    "the question is whether this is an artifact of the edgeworth or gaussian parametrizations used in these studies or shows a defect of the @xmath0-model .    in the studies of elongation ,",
    "@xmath66 is split into three components in the longitudinal center of mass system ( lcms ) of the pair : @xmath67 the lcms frame is defined as the frame , obtained by a lorentz boost along the event axis , where the sum of the three - momenta of the two pions ( @xmath68 ) is perpendicular to the event axis .",
    "assuming azimuthal symmetry about the event axis suggests that the region of homogeneity have an ellipsoidal shape with one axis , the longitudinal axis , along the event axis . in the lcms frame the event axis",
    "is referred to as the longitudinal direction , the direction of @xmath68 as the out direction , and the direction perpendicular to these as the side direction .",
    "the components of @xmath69 along these directions are denoted @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "@xmath73 is then replaced in the gaussian or edgeworth parametrizations by @xmath74 @xmath75  and @xmath76  are measures of the longitudinal and transverse size of the source , respectively , whereas the value of @xmath77  reflects both the transverse and temporal sizes .  in eq.([eq - rqlcms ] ) is usually denoted @xmath78 .",
    "we prefer to use @xmath79  to emphasize that , unlike @xmath75  and @xmath76 , @xmath77  contains a dependence on @xmath80 . ]",
    "since the present analysis uses a somewhat different event sample and mixing algorithm , we have first checked that we find values of @xmath81 consistent with our previous analysis  @xcite .",
    "we next investigate whether the @xmath0-model  parametrizations could accommodate an elongation by incorporating eq.([eq - rqlcms ] ) in eq.([eq : asymlevr2 ] ) .",
    "if eq.([eq : asymlevrar ] ) is imposed , this results in @xmath82               \\left(1 + { \\ensuremath{\\epsilon_\\mathrm{l}}}{\\ensuremath{q_\\mathrm{l}}}+ { \\ensuremath{\\epsilon_\\mathrm{side}}}{\\ensuremath{q_\\mathrm{side}}}+ { \\ensuremath{\\epsilon_\\mathrm{out}}}{\\ensuremath{q_\\mathrm{out}}}\\right ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath83 a fit of eq.([eq - asymlevr2bp ] ) for two - jet events for @xmath84 has a cl of 66% , and a clear preference for elongation is found : @xmath85 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 found in the @xmath0-model  fit shown in fig .",
    "1c lies between the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 found here .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath81 agrees well with that found using the edgeworth parametrization .    to directly test the hypothesis of no separate dependence on components of @xmath18",
    ", we investigate two decompositions of @xmath18 :    @xmath88    the first , eq.([eq - q2dec - el ] ) , corresponds to the lcms frame where the longitudinal and energy terms are combined ; its three components of @xmath18 are invariant with respect to lorentz boosts along the event axis .",
    "the second , eq.([eq - q2dec - q ] ) , corresponds to the lcms frame boosted to the rest frame of the pair ; its three components are invariant under lorentz boosts along the out direction .",
    "the test then consists of replacing @xmath89@xmath66  by @xmath89  times one of the above equations and comparing a fit where the coefficients of all three terms are constrained to be equal to a fit where each coefficient is a free parameter . for both parametrizations",
    "the fit allowing separate dependence on the components of @xmath18 has a significantly better cl than the fit which does not .",
    "the fit using eq.([eq - q2dec - el ] ) attains a cl of 2% when no separate dependence is allowed . while this is not poor enough to reject , by itself , the hypothesis of separate dependence , the fit allowing it is , with cl = 38% , much better .",
    "when eq.([eq - q2dec - q ] ) is used the fit not allowing separate dependence is rejected by a cl of @xmath90 , while allowing it results in the marginally acceptable cl of 2% . for both decompositions the differences in @xmath55  between the fit allowing separate dependence and that not allowing it is huge , 296 and 464 , respectively , while a difference of only 2 is expected if there is no separate dependence .",
    "this provides very strong evidence in favor of separate dependence on the components of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , the radii corresponding to @xmath72  and @xmath91  are found to be unequal by about a factor 2 , which violates the assumption of azimuthal symmetry assumed in the lcms analysis .",
    "the usual parametrizations of bec of pion pairs in terms of @xmath18 , such as the gaussian , edgeworth , or symmetric lvy parametrizations , are found to be incapable of describing the bec correlation function @xmath16 , particularly in the anti - correlation region , @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath0-model  assumes a very high degree of correlation between momentum space and space - time and introduces a time dependence explicitly .",
    "the two - particle bec correlation function @xmath16 is then dependent on one two - particle variable , @xmath18 , and on @xmath38 , a parameter in the correlation between momentum space and space - time .",
    "the time - dependence is assumed to be given by an asymmetric lvy distribution , @xmath37 .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 can be absorbed into an effective radius to obtain eq.([eq : asymlevr2 ] ) , which successfully describes bec for both two- and three - jet events .    for two - jet events @xmath34 and the introduction of an effective radius is unnecessary .",
    "the bec correlation function is then a function not only of @xmath18 but also of the transverse masses of the pions .",
    "this description of @xmath93 also successfully describes the data .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0-model  description breaks down when confronted with data expressed in components of @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath0-model   predicts that the only two - particle variable entering @xmath16 is @xmath18 .",
    "there is no dependence on components of @xmath18 separately .",
    "this implies a spherical shape of the pion region of homogeneity , whereas previous analyses using static parametrizations have found a shape elongated along the event axis , as evidenced by @xmath76  being smaller than @xmath75  in the lcms .",
    "assuming azimuthal symmetry about the event axis , @xmath76  is the transverse radius of the region of homogeneity . accordingly , the @xmath0-model  equations for @xmath16 have been modified _",
    "ad hoc _ to allow an elongation .",
    "the elongation found agrees with that found in previous analyses .",
    "however , in the rest frame of the pair the radius parameter in the out direction is found to be approximately twice that in the side direction .",
    "thus the assumption of azimuthal symmetry about the event axis is found not to hold .",
    "we note that elongation is expected  @xcite for a hadronizing string in the lund model , where the transverse and longitudinal components of a particle s momentum arise from different mechanisms .",
    "perhaps the absence of azimuthal symmetry arises from gluon radiation , which is represented by kinks in the lund string .",
    "therefore a possible improvement of the @xmath0-model  could be to allow the longitudinal and transverse components to have different degrees of correlation between a particle s momentum and its space - time production point .",
