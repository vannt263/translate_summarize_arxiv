    "the collaborators of a particular researcher might have interests aligned with different topics , and the set of collaborators the researcher is currently working with is a reflection of her current topic of interest .",
    "thus , by understanding circles around her co - authorship network , she might discover that she might be interested in reading papers about a certain topic that she has not been interested in before .",
    "this result in turn helps in personalized paper recommendations . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is interested to start a new collaboration in a particular field with very famous researcher ( usually having less opportunity for new collaboration ) , a more successful attempt could be to first establish a collaboration to one of the coauthors of the famous researcher who happens to belong to a circle that is most aligned to the field of interest .",

    "some interesting observations from the extensive analysis of the detected ego - centric circles are as follows : ( i ) the highly - cited authors tend to form more number of large and highly cohesive circles , ( ii ) the highly - cited authors seem to coauthor with a group of people having a specific research interest in a particular time period and then leave this group to form another such group of coauthors ; ( iii ) the highly - cited authors tend to spawn circles that have alters in very similar fields , whereas authors with medium - citations spawn more diverse circles . to evaluate the quality of the detected circles , we compare our model with four state - of - the - art overlapping community detection algorithms in terms of standard overlapping modularity measure and achieve an improvement of @xmath4 over the best baseline method .",

    "the fundamental differences of our approach compared to theirs are threefold .",
    "first , in their paper each circle is explicitly associated with a profile similarity parameter with respect to which the circle is expected to look similar . in our method , each circle is simply a collection of similar authors , which allows the circle to be associated with more than one profile similarity parameter .",
    "moreover , each circle is associated with a threshold which encompasses all profile parameters .",
    "second , the circles detected by their method are treated as latent variables and they used coordinate ascent to jointly optimize the set of circles and profile similarity patterns .",

    ". finally , while they used pseudo - boolean optimization in a pairwise graphical model , our method uses randomization for perturbing the membership .",
    "this , to the best of our knowledge , is the first attempt to detect local circles ( groups of coauthors with similar features ) centered around each ego / author in a _ co - authorship network _ and to use this information further to enhance the performance of existing _ collaboration prediction models_.    the rest of this article is organized as follows .",

    "the article is concluded by discussing the pros and cons of our model in section [ sec : discussion ] and the potential future work in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "our model for detecting ego - centric circles applies to any general ego network , where each node is considered as an ego and the set of her one - hop neighbor nodes constitute the set of alters .",
    "the ego is said to spawn the ego network , but is not considered as a part of the network .",
    "our method intends to discover circles in this ego network in an unsupervised fashion , leveraging properties specific to nodes as well as properties of the network .",
    "our model requires each node to have a profile , which is essentially the feature vector characterizing the node in a feature space .",
    "two nodes are said to be similar if their feature vectors are similar , as evaluated by an appropriate similarity metric .",
    "although exact profile details and the similarity metrics will vary depending on the nature of the network , some general assumptions made by our model are as follows : + @xmath11 alters of the same ego , that have similar profiles should be in the same circles while those with dissimilar profiles should be in different circles .",
    "+ @xmath11 alters that share an edge are more likely to be part of the same circle than disconnected alters .",
    "+ @xmath11 while it should be possible to label each circle by some common property of its member nodes , a circle may actually have more than one label . in our earlier example of a co - authorship network",
    ", two or more circles may contain authors from the same field , but may be different in some other attribute such as the authors from the same institute as shown in figure [ fig : example ] .",
    "+ @xmath11 circles may overlap and may even contain other smaller circles .",
    "we now describe the algorithm for circle formation in more details .",
    "the input to our algorithm is an ego network @xmath12 .",
    "each node @xmath13 has an @xmath14-dimensional profile vector @xmath15 = \\{@xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ... , @xmath19 } , where @xmath20 denotes the value of the @xmath21 feature of the node @xmath22 .",
    "the ego node @xmath23 , often referred to as the _ center _",
    "node , is responsible for spawning the ego network , but does not itself feature as a part of the network .",
    "so the ego network of @xmath23 is essentially the subgraph induced by the alters of @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the euclidean distance between the profile vectors of nodes @xmath25 and @xmath26 given by equation [ eq : distance ] .",
    "@xmath27    the aim of the method is to identify a set of circles @xmath28= \\{@xmath29 , @xmath30, ..... ,@xmath31}. given a circle @xmath32 and a node @xmath33 , we define the distance of @xmath26 from @xmath34 , say @xmath35 , as the average distance of @xmath26 from all other nodes in @xmath34 .",

    "we shall demonstrate the merit of this profile similarity measure in sections [ sec : parameter ] and [ sec : fec_extrac ] .    each circle @xmath34 in our model has a similarity threshold parameter @xmath38 associated with it such that if node @xmath39 is in @xmath34 then the following constraint is satisfied : @xmath40    based on our assumption that nodes within a common circle at any point of time have a higher probability of forming an edge in the network , our model predicts the circles estimated at each step to be cliques , and distinct circles not to share any edge at all . given a set of @xmath41 circles @xmath28= \\{@xmath29 , @xmath30, ..... ,@xmath31 } , along with a set of threshold parameters @xmath42 = \\{@xmath43 , @xmath44, ... ,@xmath45 } in any iteration of the algorithm , we define a _ closeness _",
    "estimator for a pair of nodes @xmath46 in terms of their circle membership , denoted by @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 and @xmath49 be defined as follows .",
    "@xmath50    note that @xmath51 if both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are members of the circle @xmath34 , while @xmath52 if @xmath34 does not contain one or both of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath53 is kept large enough to ensure that no term in the summation is negative and may simply be taken as the maximum of all threshold values , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath48 is high if @xmath25 and @xmath26 share common circles with very high thresholds , while @xmath49 is high if @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not share common circles with high thresholds .",
    "now , we define the _ closeness _ estimator @xmath47 as follows .",
    "@xmath55 ^ 2 - { [ \\beta_2(x , y)]}^2\\}\\ ] ]    note that @xmath47 is purely a circle - membership based similarity metric for the pair @xmath56 , and increases with increase in the _ number _ and _ threshold values _ of the _ common circles _ which @xmath25 and @xmath26 are part of .",
    "thus , the _ closeness _ estimator emphasizes not only the common circle memberships of nodes but also the thresholds of the circles they are part of .    from the _ closeness _ information",
    "so estimated , the probability that the pair @xmath56 forms an edge in @xmath57 is modeled by : @xmath58    similarly , for the node - pair @xmath56 which does not belong to @xmath59 , the probability is estimated as follows : @xmath60    quite evidently , @xmath61 increases with increase in @xmath47 and is normalized using _ add - one smoothing _",
    "thus we get a predicted probability of existence for each possible edge in the network given @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the rationale underlying the prediction is that the _ closeness _ of a pair of nodes @xmath56 is proportional to the similarity of their profiles as well as the number and similarity thresholds of common circles that they are a part of . now",
    "the model must ensure that this predicted network indeed corresponds to the real network , for which we present the following analysis .",
    "assuming independent generation of each edge in the graph , the joint probability of @xmath57 and @xmath28 can be written as @xmath64    we define the following notation [ eq : short2 ] for ease of expression : @xmath65 ^ 2 - { [ \\beta_2(x , y)]}^2)\\ ] ]    taking logarithm of equation [ eq : probgraph ] , and using notation [ eq : short2 ] we can express the log likelihood of @xmath57 given @xmath28 and @xmath66 as : @xmath67    the model thus attempts to identify a set of circles @xmath62 that maximizes @xmath68 . in section [ sec : parameter ] we describe how this may be achieved by optimizing @xmath63 .",

    "initially , each node is in a different circle with a very high threshold value . at each iteration @xmath69 , for each node @xmath39 we alter the circle membership of @xmath26 by randomly adding it to some circles it previously did not belong to and deleting it from some circles it belonged to .",
    "this is similar to the concept of perturbing the solution in simulated annealing @xcite .",
    "the circle thresholds are then updated accordingly such that the constraint in equation [ eq : constraint ] is not violated .",
    "the general idea is that larger the number of circles a node @xmath26 is already part of after time step @xmath69 , lesser is the extent to which the circle membership of @xmath26 is disturbed in time step @xmath70 .",

    "we observe that @xmath152 reaches maximum at @xmath153 .",
    "then for each competing algorithm , we measure the value of @xmath152 for each ego and take an average over all the egos present in our dataset .",
    "the table adjacent to figure [ fig : tau ] shows that our method outperforms the traditional topology based community finding algorithms in detecting meaningful circles .",
    "our method achieves @xmath152 of 0.68 which is 6.25% higher than coordinate ascent method , 13.33% higher than bigclam , 15.25% higher than oslom , 17.24% higher than copra , and 21.42% higher than slpa .",
    "we notice that research field based circles are the worst among the detected circles ( see section [ sec : interpretation ] for more discussion ) .",
    "in this section , we intend to characterize the ego - centric circles obtained from our unsupervised model . in particular , we study the properties of the ego - centric circles at two levels of granularity : author - specific analysis and circle - specific analysis .      here",
    "we study how the circles in the ego networks of the highly - cited authors differ from those of the low - cited authors .",
    "figure [ fig : author_specific](a ) shows the number of ego - centric circles appearing in the ego network of each author .",
    "note that in all of the experiments , we categorize authors into three groups : authors receiving more than 100 citations as _ highly - cited authors _",
    "( proportion : 5.21% ) , authors receiving citations between 30 - 100 as _ medium - cited authors _",
    "( proportion : 28.75% ) , and authors receiving less than 30 citations as _ low - cited authors _",
    "( proportion : 66.04% ) .",
    "we notice a rise in the number of circles with the increase of citations . the possible reason could be that since the authors accumulating high citations tend to have high number of collaborators , the number of alters in their ego networks is also high , and thus more number of ego - centric circles are detected for the highly - cited authors .    in figure",
    "[ fig : author_specific](b ) , we plot the average size ( measured in terms of the number of nodes ) of the ego - centric circles for the authors in different citation range . once again",
    ", the average size of the circles increases with the increase of citations per author .",
    "it essentially indicates that for the highly - cited egos , the alters are not only high in number but also form large cohesive groups .",
    "since each author is also an alter in her neighbors ego networks , she might be a part of multiple such ego - centric circles .",
    "figure [ fig : author_specific](c ) shows the number of such ego - centric circles to which an author belongs to .",
    "this plot highly correlates with figure [ fig : author_specific](a ) , and shows that since highly - cited authors have more number of alters in their ego networks , each of them also belongs to multiple local circles of her neighbors ego networks .",
    "further , we measure the _ degree of cliquishness _ ( the ratio of the number of existing edges in the circle and the maximum number of possible edges in the circle ) of each ego - centric circle . for each ego , we measure the average cliquishness of her surrounding circles in the ego network .",
    "figure [ fig : author_specific](d ) shows that the average value of cliquishness initially decreases with the increase of the number of citations per author , then it starts increasing . the reason could be that since both the number and the size of the ego - centric circles for low - cited authors are less , the maximum number of possible edges within a circle is also less , which in turn acts as the reason of high cliquishness for low - cited authors . in the middle citation zone ,",
    "both the number and the average size of the circles are moderate . however , the number of edges that materialize within these circles is less as compared to the maximum number of possible edges , thus accounting for the sparseness of these circles .",
    "therefore , the value of cliquishness of circles spawned by authors in the middle range of citations is comparatively low .",
    "however , the value of cliquishness starts increasing for the authors having citations more than 100 .",
    "this signifies that for the highly - cited authors , despite the apparently large size of circles , the probability that an edge actually materializes in the real network tends to increase .",
    "this explains the formation of dense ego - centric cliques surrounding the ego in the high - citation range .",
    "now we look into some of the characteristic features specific to an ego - centric circle . in figure",
    "[ fig : circle_specific](a ) , we plot the percentage of ego - centric circles having a particular size @xmath154 .",
    "it follows a gaussian distribution at the beginning along with a heavy tail at the end .",
    "we observe that around 65.26% circles have sizes ranging between 4 - 30 .",
    "however , the flat tail at the end shows that more than 15% circles have size greater than 50 .",
    "figure [ fig : circle_specific](b ) shows the distribution of the cliquishness ( @xmath155 ) of the ego - centric circles .",
    "surprisingly , it again follows a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath156 and variance @xmath157 .",
    "we notice that around 59.28% circles have cliquishness values ranging between @xmath158 $ ] which is quite high .",
    "further inspection reveals that low - degree egos are surrounded by small - size circles and therefore their cliquishness value is quite high . to get a clear idea of the relation between the size and the cliquishness of the ego - centric circles , we plot in figure [ fig : circle_specific](c ) the average cliquishness of the circles having a specific size .",
    "the value of cliquishness @xmath155 gradually decreases with the increase of the size @xmath154 till @xmath154=40 , which is followed by a sharp increase .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the increase of cliquishness at the end once again emphasizes that the large - size circles centered around the highly - cited authors are relatively dense .",
    "finally , we plot the percentage of egos surrounded by a specific number of circles in figure [ fig : circle_specific](d ) . as expected , we observe that the plot has a declining trend from the very beginning , which once again highlights our previous observation that most of the low - cited authors have a low degree in the co - authorship network , and spawn only a few ego - centric circles .",
    "since the co - authorship network is mostly dominated by low - degree authors , most of the egos are fringed by a small number of local circles .",
    "in co - authorship network , most intuitive ground - truth communities are often assumed to be different areas of research @xcite in a particular domain .",
    "therefore , one can interpret each ego - centric circle as a group of coauthors working in a specific research area .",
    "since we know the major research area of each author in the dataset , for each ego we further group its coauthors based on only their major research area such that each circle corresponds to an area and constitutes coauthors working on this area .",
    "then we measure the average cliquishness of the research field based circles for each author vis - a - vis that of the ego - centric circles detected by our model .",
    "essentially , we intend to cross - validate our hypothesis that considering a single dimensional feature vector of an author such as the field information is not an appropriate way of encircling alters ; rather each circle might represent individual dimension of cohesiveness among its constituent nodes as shown in figure [ fig : example ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : purity](a ) , we plot the average cliquishness of field - based circles vis - a - vis that of the circles detected by the model surrounding each author . as expected , the cliquishness of the detected circles is significantly higher than that of the field - based circles . therefore , we conclude that the field - based circles might not appropriately group highly cohesive nodes , rather the circles detected by our model seem to be more representative and meaningful .",
    "we further mark each of the detected circles by that field which is also the major research area for most of its constituent coauthors .",
    "then for each ego , we measure the fraction of circles belonging to each of the 24 fields .",
    "therefore , each ego / author can now be represented by a vector of size 24 whose @xmath21 entry represents the fraction of ego - centric circles marked by field @xmath159 .",
    "figure [ fig : heatmap ] shows three heat maps corresponding to highly - cited , medium - cited and low - cited authors . for the sake of brevity , we only plot values for 1000 authors from each citation range although the results are similar for other authors . we observe that for highly - cited authors , ego - centric circles are mostly marked by few fields , which indicates that the highly - cited authors tend to collaborate with people from similar research area .",
    "if this is true , then the immediate question would be why the coauthors having same research interest are encircled into different groups by our model .",
    "further inspection reveals that along with the field , each group also represents the time of collaboration .",
    "for instance , the ego network of author 1 ( one of the highly - cited authors ) is shown in figure [ fig : sample](a ) .",
    "one group of her ego network encircles authors in data mining who have coauthored with her during 19972000 .",
    "another such group constitutes authors from machine learning , who have collaborated with her during 20002003 .",
    "therefore , the field of research and the time of collaboration act as two major dimensions in this case .",
    "next for the medium - cited authors , the heat map in figure [ fig : heatmap](b ) shows that the distribution of circles into different fields seems to be much more uniform as compared to figure [ fig : heatmap](a ) .",
    "the example shown in figure [ fig : sample](b ) also corroborates with the hypothesis that with the decrease of citations , the ego - centric circles tend to become even more complicated to be interpreted distinctly . from figure",
    "[ fig : sample](b ) , we notice that the time duration of collaboration corresponding to the circles are overlapping and , therefore , it is very hard to distinguish these circles .",
    "the result is even more cluttered for low - cited authors as shown in figures [ fig : heatmap](c ) and [ fig : sample](c ) .",
    "these results thus lead to a general conclusion that the highly - cited authors seem to coauthor with a group of people having a specific research interest in a particular time period and then move to another such group of coauthors ; whereas this tendency is not so prominent for medium- and low - cited authors .",
    "however , we posit that there might be other dimensions ( such as the name of the institute where the author belongs to ) that might help us interpret these circles more clearly . + * homogeneity of ego - centric circles . *",
    "we define a field - based homogeneity for ego - centric circles to verify if , in most cases , authors from the same field tend to form communities and whether the circles spawned by our unsupervised approach are able to capture this tendency .",
    "given a circle @xmath160 , we define @xmath161 to be the fraction of authors in @xmath160 with major field @xmath162 .",
    "one can easily infer that a uniform distribution @xmath161 implies that the circle is homogeneous with respect to the field of work while a skewed distribution ( with majority of authors in one or two fields ) characterizes a more field - specific circle .",
    "in particular , we define the homogeneity coefficient @xmath163 for circle @xmath160 in terms of the entropy of the circle with respect to the distribution across different fields as in equation [ entro ] . greater the entropy , lesser is the homogeneity and vice versa .",
    "@xmath164{\\sum_{i=1}^{24}{f_{c , i}}^\\alpha }    h(c ) = \\frac{1}{1 -\\sum_{i=1}^{24}{f_{c , i}\\log(f_{c , i})}}\\ ] ]    figure [ fig : purity](b ) captures the average homogeneity of circles in the ego - network of authors in four different citation ranges .",
    "we note that the homogeneity is highest for the authors with very high citation ranges @xmath165 and has low variance , indicating that highly - cited authors tend to spawn circles that have alters in very similar fields , whereas authors with medium citations @xmath166 spawn more diverse circles .",
    "the authors with low citations @xmath167 exhibit higher degree of homogeneity than those in the medium range , but this may be attributed to the fact that they spawn very small - sized circles .",
    "we further evaluate the quality of the circles through a task based evaluation framework  the task of collaboration prediction .",
    "we choose two supervised learning models : linear regression ( lr ) @xcite and supervised random walks ( srw ) @xcite . then we demonstrate that inclusion of the ego - centric circles detected by our model as a feature in the feature set would eventually enhance the performance of this model with respect to the one in which the circle information is missing .      for our problem",
    ", we assume a temporal graph @xmath168 where @xmath169 represents a set of nodes such that each node @xmath170 is associated with a time stamp @xmath69 indicating its first appearance in @xmath171 , and each edge @xmath172 connects two nodes @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( such that @xmath173,@xmath175 and @xmath176 ) .",
    "each node @xmath177 is also associated with a feature vector @xmath178 at time stamp @xmath69 , whose entires might change over time . now , given a longitudinal snapshot of the graph @xmath171 from the beginning till time @xmath179 , say @xmath180 , the collaboration prediction problem aims at predicting the collaborations which are going to appear among the vertices in @xmath181 within @xmath182 time period after @xmath179 .",
    "this task is very challenging due to extreme sparsity of real networks where each node is connected to only a very small fraction of all other nodes in the network ( the presence of high proportion of negative evidences in the dataset ) .",
    "backstrom and leskovec @xcite proposed a link prediction method based on _ supervised random walks _ which combines the information of the network structure with node and edge attributes to predict links efficiently .",
    "these node and edge features are used to learn edge strengths ( i.e. , random walk transition probabilities ) such that a random walk on the network is more likely to visit `` positive '' than `` negative '' nodes . here , positive nodes are the ones to which new edges will be created in the future , and the negative are the remaining nodes .",
    "the authors summarized a supervised learning task provided a source node @xmath183 and training examples as to which nodes @xmath183 is connected .",
    "next , they formulated the problem of studying the function that assigns a strength ( i.e. , random walk transition probability ) to each edge such that the random walk scores in the nodes to which @xmath183 creates new links are higher than nodes to which @xmath183 does not create links .",
    "two aspects behind this model are discussed as follows :    * _ node ranking aspect . _ designing an approach that will assign high scores to nodes which @xmath183 creates links to than to those that @xmath183 does not link to .",
    "this method mainly takes advantage of the structure of the network . *",
    "_ classification aspect .",
    "_ exploiting a classifier that predicts pairs of nodes that @xmath183 is going to create links with and denote them as positive training examples ; the other nodes are denoted as negative training examples .",
    "it needs to consider how to extract the node and the edge features .",
    "we use a set of node- and edge - level features for the learning models .",
    "the following set of node - level features ( denoted by @xmath14 ) are used .",
    "each feature is normalized by the maximum value of the corresponding feature so that the values range between 0 to 1 .",
    "+ @xmath11 normalized number of citations received by an author + @xmath11 normalized h - index of an author + @xmath11 normalized number of coauthors of an author + @xmath11 fraction of papers by an author in each of the 24 fields + @xmath11 normalized number of papers written by an author + @xmath11 fraction of papers published by an author in each of the five decades ( between 1960 - 2009 )    further , given an edge @xmath184 in the co - authorship network , we additionally use the following edge - level features ( denoted by @xmath59 ) .",
    "each feature is appropriately normalized to a value between 0 and 1 .",
    "+ @xmath11 fraction of papers coauthored by @xmath25 and @xmath26 in each of the five decades + @xmath11 normalized number of common coauthors of @xmath25 and @xmath26 + @xmath11 fraction of papers authored by @xmath25 in the major field of @xmath26 + @xmath11 fraction of papers authored by @xmath26 in the major field of @xmath25    we refer to the combined set of both node- and edge - level features by @xmath185 .",
    "we provide this set @xmath185 of node and edge attributes as an input to the learning model which then takes care of determining how to combine them with the network structure to make predictions @xcite .",
    "note that if we take the dataset till @xmath69 for training the model , all the features mentioned above will be calculated based on the statistics of each vertex till @xmath69 in order to avoid information leakage .",
    "another important aspect in srw model is the choice of the edge strength function @xmath186 to combine the weight ( obtained after training the model ) for each feature and the value of the corresponding feature",
    ". the edge strength must be non - negative and differentiable .",
    "backstrom and leskovec @xcite experimented with two functions  exponential edge strength and logistic edge strength , and showed that the choice of the edge strength function does not seem to make a significant impact on performance .",
    "however , there was slight evidence from our experiments that the logistic function performs better .",
    "therefore , in this experiment we consider the logistic edge strength @xmath187 of an edge @xmath56 as follows .",
    "we start by taking the inner product of the weight vector @xmath188 and the feature vector @xmath189 of an edge @xmath56 . then to transform this into the desired domain",
    ", we apply the logistic function : @xmath190    in the above discussion , the weight vector @xmath188 is determined by srw during the training phase .",
    "we design three competing models using the srw framework as follows :    * * srw+nf:*this model uses only the node - level feature vector @xmath191 . *",
    "* srw+nf:*this model uses only the edge - level feature vector @xmath192 . *",
    "* srw+f : * this model uses only the feature vector @xmath193 . *",
    "* srw+fb : * this model , besides @xmath193 also includes a binary feature @xmath194 that checks whether a pair of nodes @xmath56 belong to at least one common ego - centric circle or not .",
    "* * srw+fbc : * this mode besides @xmath193 and @xmath194 also includes a numeric feature @xmath160 indicating the number of common circles a pair of nodes @xmath56 is a part of .      in order to demonstrate that predictions are robust irrespective of the time stamp considered for dividing the dataset into training and test sets , we run the competing models in three different time periods : ( i ) the dataset till 1995 is considered for training and the accuracies of the models are measured by comparing the new edges formed between 1996 - 1999 , ( ii ) similarly , the dataset till 2000 for training and 2001 - 2004 for checking the accuracy , and ( iii ) the dataset till 2005 for training and 2006 - 2009 for checking the accuracy .    in each time stamp , we evaluate the methods on the test set , considering two performance metrics : the area under the roc curve ( @xmath2 ) and the precision at top 20 ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. , for each node @xmath183 , what fraction of top 20 nodes suggested by each model actually receive links from @xmath183 later .",
    "this measure is particularly appropriate in the context of link - recommendation where we present a user with a set of suggested coauthors and aim that most of them are correct .",
    "we compare the predictive performance of two learning models including the circle information in three different time periods as mentioned in section [ subsec : evaluation ] .",
    "we iterate each of these collaboration prediction models using different sets of features : ( i ) only node - level features ( _ model : n _ ) , ( ii ) only edge - level features ( _ model : e _ ) , ( iii ) both node and edge level features ( _ model : ne _ ) , ( iv ) besides node and edge level features , including a binary feature @xmath194 that checks whether a pair of nodes @xmath56 belong to at least one common ego - centric circle or not ( _ model : neb _ ) , and ( v ) besides node - level and edge - level features and the binary circle information , including a numeric feature @xmath160 indicating the number of common circles a pair of nodes @xmath56 is a part of ( _ model : nebc _ ) .",
    "the circles are detected by our model , the coordinate ascent method ( ca ) @xcite and bigclam separately .",
    "table [ table : auc ] shows the performance of these two prediction models with different feature sets .",
    "we notice that edge features are more effective than node features , and the performance improves incrementally after combining different features together .",
    "a general observation is that inclusion of circle information in the feature set improves the performance of both the prediction models irrespective of the time periods .",
    "for instance , it improves the performance by @xmath0 and @xmath1 on average in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively compared to the case , where the circle information is not present ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "we further observe that the inclusion of circle information detected by our model significantly outperforms the case where the circles are obtained by bigclam and ca in each time stamp . including the binary circle information ( @xmath195 ) from our model achieves an average auc improvement of 2.16% and 3.51% respectively for lr and srw models ( similarly , in terms of @xmath3 , the improvement is 3.75% and 2.94% respectively for lr and srw models ) compared to bigclam ( ca ) .",
    "further , including the count of common circles for a node pair ( @xmath196 ) in the feature set leads both lr and srw to achieve even better performance .",
    "we observe an average auc improvement of 3.41% ( 1.11% ) and 3.31% ( 0.57% ) respectively for lr and srw models using our circle information as compared to that obtained from bigclam ( ca ) ( similarly , in terms of @xmath3 , the improvement is 6.35% ( 5.14% ) and 6.16% ( 3.22% ) respectively for lr and srw models ) .",
    "circles allow us to organize the overwhelming volumes of data generated by an author s personal academic network . in this work , we proposed a simple yet effective method of detecting ego - centric circles in co - authorship networks .",
