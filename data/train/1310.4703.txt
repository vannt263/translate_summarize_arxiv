    "one would like to use accurate first - principles methods to better understand what controls the relative stability of the different phases of bfo , and thus what determines its complex and still debated phase diagram .",

    "this makes it possible to apply to bfo tools that are well - known for the analysis of solid - solid phase transitions in other research fields,@xcite and which are based on the calculation of the free energy of the individual phases as a function of temperature , pressure , etc .",
    "the simplest of such techniques , which requires relatively affordable first - principles simulations , is based on a _ quasi - harmonic _ approximation to the calculation of the free energy ( qhf method in the following ) .",
    "this is the scheme adopted in this work to investigate bfo s @xmath9 phase diagram .",
    "we should stress , though , that application of the qhf scheme to bfo is not completely straightforward .",
    "indeed , the spin and vibrational degrees of freedom in multiferroic materials can be expected to couple significantly ( i.e. , spin - phonon coupling effects become non - negligible,@xcite see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) implying that the free energies of ferromagnetic , anti - ferromagnetic , and paramagnetic phases belonging to a same crystal structure may differ significantly .",
    "the situation becomes especially complicated whenever we have structural transitions involving paramagnetic phases , as capturing the effect of disordered spin arrangements would in principle require the use of very large simulation boxes.@xcite in this work we have introduced and applied an approximate scheme to circumvent such a difficulty .",

    "the @xmath100 parameters describe the magnetic interactions when the atoms remain at their equilibrium positions ; typically , these parameters will capture the bulk of the exchange couplings .",
    "the @xmath101 coefficients describe the forces that may appear on the atoms when we have certain spin arrangements , and the @xmath102 parameters capture the dependence of the phonon spectrum on the spin configuration .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while the energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqh ] ) can be unambiguously described as a harmonic expansion around an equilibrium state of the material , the interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - phonon - energy ] ) is much more subtle . indeed , because we work with spin variables that have a fixed norm ( nominally , @xmath103 in the case of the fe@xmath104 cations in bifeo@xmath0 ) , the reference structure of our spin - phonon qh energy is defined _ formally _ as one in which the atomic spins are _ perfectly disordered _ and the atoms are located at the corresponding equilibrium positions .",
    "such a structure can not be easily considered in a first - principles calculation ; hence , we have to obtain the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 that characterize it in an indirect way .",
    "in essence , the fitting procedure would involve many different spin configurations , and parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 would capture the part of the energy and force - constant matrix that is _ independent _ of the spin order .",
    "further , a thorough calculation of the @xmath107 constants would be a very challenging task .",
    "indeed , a detailed modeling of the spin - phonon couplings would require us to choose which spin pairs @xmath5 and @xmath98 are affected by which distortions pairs @xmath96 and @xmath97 , a problem that quickly grows in complexity even if we restrict ourselves to spin interactions between first nearest neighbors .    in this work we did not attempt to pursue such a detailed description , but adopted instead an approximate approach that provides the correct results in particular important cases . to illustrate our scheme ,",
    "let us think of bfo s @xmath37 phase and consider two specific spin arrangements that are obviously relevant : ( 1 ) the g - afm structure ( which is the ground state of the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath108 bfo phases mentioned above ) and ( 2 ) a perfectly ferromagnetic ( fm ) arrangement , which is the exact opposite case to g - afm in the sense that all the interactions between first nearest - neighboring spins are _ reversed_. let us also restrict ourselves to spin - spin interactions between first nearest neighbors and , for the sake of simplicity , let us assume that all first - nearest - neighboring spins are coupled by the same @xmath109 , so that we can drop the @xmath5 and @xmath98 indexes .",
    "( this is actually the case for the @xmath37 phase of bfo , and the generalization to other lower - symmetry cases is straightforward . ) then , for a given spin arrangement @xmath12 ( where @xmath12 can be g - afm or fm in this example ) , we can relax the atomic structure of the material and construct the following energy @xmath110 @xmath111 which is the analogous of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqh ] ) above .",
    "hence , we have straightforward access to all the parameters in this expression from first principles .",
    "now , we want our general spin - phonon energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - phonon - energy ] ) to reproduce @xmath110 for the @xmath12-orders of interest .",
    "if we are dealing with the g - afm and fm cases , it is trivial to check that this can be achieved by making the following choices : @xmath112 while these choices may seem very natural , there are subtle approximations and simplifications hiding behind them .",
    "for example , the resulting model contains no explicit information about the atomic rearrangements that may accompany a particular spin configuration ; nevertheless , the energies of the equilibrium structures are perfectly well reproduced for the g - afm and fm cases .",
    "analogously , while the phonons of the g - afm and fm cases will be exactly reproduced by this model , the spin - phonon interactions have been drastically simplified , and we retain no information on how specific atomic motions affect specific exchange constants . hence , the resulting model should not be viewed as an atomistic one ; rather , it is closer to a phenomenological approach in which we retain information about the effect of magnetic order on the whole phonon spectrum .",
    "finally , we would like to use our spin - phonon energy to investigate the properties of bfo at finite temperatures , especially in situations in which the material is either paramagnetic ( pm ) or does not have a fully developed afm order . to do so",
    ", we will assume that , for the case of fluctuating spins , the energetics of the atomic distortions is approximately given by : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the correlation function between two neighboring spins , with @xmath115 indicating a thermal average .",
    "note that in the limiting fm ( @xmath116 ) and g - afm ( @xmath117 ) cases , this equation reduces to the expected @xmath118 and @xmath119 energies .",
    "note also that this model includes a spin - phonon contribution to the energy even in the paramagnetic phase , as long as there are significant correlations between neighboring spins .",
    "indeed , for a non - zero value of @xmath120 , the phonon spectrum is given by the force - constant matrix @xmath121 .",
    "in this work , we evaluate @xmath120 as a function of temperature by running monte carlo simulations of the heisenberg spin system described by the @xmath122 coupling constants , thus assuming frozen atomic distortions .",
    "then , since for a certain value of @xmath120 eq .  ( [ eq : eqhprime4 ] ) is formally analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqh ] ) , we can apply the qh treatment described above to estimate the helmholtz free energy @xmath123 of the coupled spin - phonon system .    before concluding this section ,",
    "let us discuss some approximate expressions that can be obtained for @xmath123 and which are illustrative of how our approach captures the effect of spin fluctuations and of the peculiar nature of the paramagnetic state .",
    "we have usually observed that the normal - mode frequencies @xmath124 , obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix associated to @xmath125 , depend significantly on the magnetic order .",
    "however , the corresponding eigenvectors are largely independent from @xmath12 . as a result",
    "we have the following approximate relations @xmath126 where @xmath127 are the frequencies associated to @xmath128 . using this result ,",
    "we can write the helmholtz free energy in the high temperature limit as @xmath129 \\label{eq : eqhprime7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where terms @xmath130 and @xmath131 are calculated in the classical limit through eq .",
    "( [ eq : classfharm ] ) and correspond to perfect fm and g - afm spin arrangements .",
    "note that in the limiting cases @xmath132 and @xmath133 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqhprime7 ] ) consistently reduces to @xmath130 and @xmath134 .",
    "interestingly , in the ideal paramagnetic case @xmath135 we find that , since all @xmath92 are positive , the inequality @xmath136 holds .",
    "this result sets a lower bound for the error that we would be making if the spin disorder in ideal paramagnetic phases was neglected .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath37 phase of bfo , if we used a frozen g - afm spin structure in our qh calculations , the resulting free energy error would be of order @xmath137 .      in order to compute the qh free energy of a crystal ,",
    "it is necessary to know its full phonon spectrum over the whole bz .",
    "there are essentially two methods which can be used for the calculation of the phonon frequencies : linear response theory and the direct approach .",
    "the first method is generally exploited within the framework of density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt);@xcite the main idea in dfpt is that a linear order variation in the electron density upon application of a perturbation to the crystal is the responsible for the variation in the energy up to third order in the perturbation .",
    "if the perturbation is a phonon wave with wave - vector @xmath138 , the calculation of the density change to linear order can thus be used to determine the dynamical matrix at wave - vector @xmath138 .",
    "this procedure can be repeated at any wave - vector and without the need to construct a supercell . in the direct approach , in contrast , the force - constant matrix is directly calculated in real - space by considering the proportionality between the atomic displacements and forces when the former are sufficiently small ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : fqh]).@xcite in this case , large supercells have to be constructed in order to guarantee that the elements of the force - constant matrix have all fallen off to negligible values at their boundaries , a condition that follows from the use of periodic boundary conditions.@xcite once the force - constant matrix is thus obtained , we can fourier - transform it to obtain the phonon spectrum at any @xmath26-point . in this work we chose to perform phonon frequencies calculations with the direct method",
    ". nevertheless , convergence of the force - constant matrix elements with respect to the size of the supercell in polar materials may be slow due to the appearance of charge dipoles and macroscopic electric fields in the limit of zero wave - vector ; in the next section we explain how we have efficiently dealt with this issue .",
    "we performed a series of initial tests in the @xmath37 phase to determine the value of the various calculation parameters that guarantee @xmath82 results converged to within @xmath139  mev / f.u .",
    "( as it will be shown later , this accuracy threshold translates into uncertainties of about 100  k in the predicted transition temperatures . )",
    "the quantities with respect to which our qh free energies need to be converged are the size of the supercell , the size of the atomic displacements , and the numerical accuracy in the calculation of the atomic forces and bz sampling ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : fharm ] ) .",
    "we found the following settings to fulfill our convergence requirements : @xmath140 supercells ( i.e. , 8 replications of the 10-atom unit cell of the @xmath37 phase ) , atomic displacements of @xmath141   , and special monkhorst - pack@xcite grids of @xmath142 @xmath26-points , corresponding to the bz of the @xmath37-phase unit cell , to compute the sums in eq .",

    ", which is our targeted accuracy threshold . in view of the small size of these corrections , and for the sake of computational affordability",
    ", we decided not to consider @xmath153 terms in our subsequent calculations , for which we just employed the original real - space version of the direct approach .",
    "in fact , as it has already been pointed out by alf,@xcite in the typical case an incorrect treatment of the longitudinal optical modes near the @xmath53-point compromises only a small region of the bz , and the resulting errors in the free energy are small and can in principle be neglected .",
    "[ tab : lo - to - freq ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section we analyze the thermodynamic stability of the four studied crystal structures under hydrostatic pressure at @xmath154  k. we take into account zpe corrections and consider also negative pressures .    in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] we plot the enthalpy energy ( i.e. , @xmath155 ) of the @xmath38 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 phases as a function of @xmath29 , taking the result for the @xmath37 structure as the pressure - dependent zero of enthalpy . a first - order transformation between phases",
    "@xmath156 and @xmath157 occurs at pressure @xmath158 when the enthalpy energy difference @xmath159 becomes zero . in all the cases we present the results",
    "obtained both when neglecting zpe corrections ( i.e. , for @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) and when fully considering them ( i.e. , for @xmath162 and @xmath163 / \\partial v$ ] ) .",
    "additional phonon and static energy calculations were performed whenever required in order to compute accurate enthalpies in the pressure interval @xmath1642  gpa @xmath165  10  gpa .    as we increase the pressure , we find two phase transitions of the @xmath166 and @xmath167 types .",
    "the @xmath168 transition occurs at @xmath1640.3(1 )  gpa and the associated volume change is @xmath169  @xmath170/f.u . ; at this transition pressure , the @xmath41 phase presents a volume of 71.94  @xmath170/f.u . and a very large @xmath30 ratio of about 2 .",
    "the @xmath167 transition occurs at 3.6(1 )  gpa , and the volume changes from 63.04  @xmath170/f.u . to 61.13  @xmath170/f.u . ; the corresponding structural data is given in table  ii .",
    "interestingly , the pressure - dependence of the enthalpies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] resemble the results reported in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] for @xmath83 as a function of temperature .",
    "in particular , under compression the @xmath41 phase becomes higher in enthalpy than the rest , and the enthalpy of the @xmath38 phase turns out to be the smallest . also , the @xmath40 phase gets energetically favored over the @xmath37 structure upon increasing pressure , although it never becomes the most stable structure .    the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows the enthalpy results obtained when zpe corrections are neglected .",
    "interestingly , while the main trends are conserved , the pressure of the @xmath167 transformation turns out to be shifted up to 4.8(1 )  gpa .",
    "this result shows that atomic quantum delocalization effects in perovskite oxides may be important for accurate prediction of @xmath29-induced phase transitions .",
    "our results for the @xmath167 transformation are consistent with those of previous theoretical studies,@xcite the quantitative differences being related to the varying dft flavors employed , consideration of typically - neglected zpe corrections , and other technicalities . as regards the connection with experiment , it is worth noting that we predict the @xmath167 transition to occur at a pressure ( 3.6  gpa ) that is rather close to the one at which the @xmath37 phase has been observed to transform into a complex structure by guennou _",
    "et al._@xcite ( i.e. , @xmath171  4  gpa at room temperature ) .",
    "it is therefore tempting to identify the experimentally detected complex structure with the family of @xmath40 phases of which we have investigated a representative case ; indeed , verifying a possible @xmath172 transition sequence was one of our motivations to investigate the effects of pressure .",
    "however , our calculations render a direct @xmath173 transition , which suggests that the experimentally observed complex structures might actually be very long - lived meta - stable states , as opposed to actual equilibrium phases . on the other hand , as explained in section  [ subsec : complex ] , getting accurate predictions near transition points at which @xmath174 is clearly a challenging task , and many factors can come into play and affect the results .",
    "hence , we can not fully discard the possibility that , under pressure , the @xmath37 structure transforms into a complex equilibrium phase .",
    "in previous sections we have highlighted that the differences in the helmholtz free energies and enthalpies of the @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath40 phases are calculated to be exceedingly small .",
    "in such conditions , our predictions for the equilibrium phase may depend , among other factors , on the employed exchange - correlation dft energy functional . in this sense ,",
    "diguez _ et al .",
    "_ already found@xcite that , in bfo , energy differences between stable structures depend strongly on the dft energy functional used , with variations in @xmath65 that may be as large as 0.1  ev per formula unit .",
    "to estimate the magnitude of this type of uncertainties in our @xmath175 results computed with a pbe+@xmath176 functional , we repeated our qh investigation of temperature - driven transitions  at constant volume and frozen - spin conditions  using a lda+@xmath176 scheme .",
    "our lda+@xmath176 results show , in accordance with the presented pbe+@xmath176 study , that the orthorhombic @xmath38 phase gets thermodynamically stabilized over the rest of structures at high temperatures , and that the @xmath41 phase goes steadily higher in free energy .",
    "further , the lda+@xmath176 results indicate that the @xmath167 transition occurs at approximately 500  k , which is much lower than the experimental result .",
    "interestingly , most of the the discrepancy between this lda+@xmath176 result and our pbe+@xmath176 prediction ( 900  k ) can be traced back to the different equilibrium energies in the 0  k limit , with the phonon contributions to the free energy playing a secondary role . indeed , from the pbe+@xmath176 calculations we get @xmath177  = @xmath178  ev / f.u . , while the lda+@xmath176 result is @xmath179  ev / f.u .",
    "obviously , the lda+@xmath176 functional brings the @xmath37 and @xmath38 phases much closer in energy , which leads to the stabilization of the @xmath38 structure at a much lower temperature . additionally , the @xmath83 of the @xmath40 phase remains always about 50  mev / f.u .",
    "higher than that of the @xmath37 phase , the difference being weakly dependent on temperature .",
    "hence , our calculations confirm that quantitative predictions of transition temperatures are strongly dependent on the employed dft functional .",
    "we can also conclude that the lda functional does not capture properly the relative stability of the @xmath37 and @xmath180 phases of bfo , and that the pbe functional is a much better choice . in this sense ,",
    "our work ratifies the conclusions presented in ref .  .",
    "we have performed a first - principles study of the @xmath9 phase diagram of bulk multiferroic bfo relying on quasi - harmonic free energy calculations .",
    "we have analyzed the thermodynamic stability of four different crystal structures that have been observed , or predicted to exist , at normal and high @xmath29 or @xmath36 conditions and/or in thin films under epitaxial constraints . in order to incorporate the effects of spin - phonon coupling on the quasi - harmonic calculation of the helmholtz free energies ,",
    "we have developed an approximate and technically simple scheme that allows us to model states with varying degrees of spin disorder .",
    "consistent with observations , we find that the rhombohedral @xmath1 ferroelectric phase ( @xmath37 phase ) is the ground state of the material at ambient conditions of pressure . then , an orthorhombic @xmath2 structure ( @xmath38 phase ) , which is the vibrationally - softest of all the considered structures , is found to stabilize upon increasing @xmath36 or @xmath29 .",
    "more precisely , two first - order phase transitions of the @xmath181 type are predicted to occur at the thermodynamic states [ 0  gpa , 1300(100 )  k ] and [ 3.6(1 )  gpa , 0  k ] .    additionally , a representative of the so - called _ nano - twinned _ structures recently predicted to occur in bfo@xcite has been analyzed in this work .",
    "this phase is found to display elastic and vibrational features that are reminiscent of the results obtained for both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 structures , and to become energetically more stable than the @xmath37 phase upon raising @xmath29 and @xmath36 .",
    "the entropy and enthalpy of the @xmath38 phase , however , turn out to be more favorable than those of the studied @xmath40 structure over practically all the investigated @xmath9 intervals , and as a result we do not observe any direct @xmath182 or @xmath183 transformation . nevertheless , our results can not be conclusive in this point due to the limitations of the study ( only one specific nano - twinned structure is investigated ) and dft - related accuracy problems that appear when tackling very small free - energy differences ( i.e. , of order @xmath184  mev / f.u . ) .",
    "in fact , our results seem to support the possibility that some nano - twinned structures may become stable at the boundaries between @xmath37 and @xmath38 phases in the @xmath9 phase diagram of bfo , or at least exist as long - lived meta - stable phases that are likely to be accessed depending on the kinetics of the @xmath167 transformation .    finally , we find that a representative of the so - called _ super - tetragonal _ phases of bfo gets energetically destabilized over the rest of crystal structures by effect of increasing temperature , due to the fact that its spectrum of phonon frequencies is globally the stiffest one .",
    "this explains why super - tetragonal structures have never been observed in bulk bfo , in spite of the fact that their dft - predicted energies are very close to those of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 phases .",
    "interestingly , the investigated super - tetragonal structure is also destabilized upon hydrostatic compression .    as far as we know , our work is the first application of the quasi - harmonic free energy method to the study of the phase diagram of a multiferroic perovskite system .",
    "the main advantages of this approach are that is computationally affordable , can be straightforwardly applied to the study of crystals , and naturally incorporates zero - point energy corrections . among its shortcomings , we note that it can be exclusively applied to the analysis of vibrationally stable crystal structures ; further , it only incorporates anharmonic effects _ via _ the volume - dependence of the phonon frequencies and corresponding treatment of the thermal expansion , which may be a questionable approximation at high temperatures .",
    "nevertheless , we may think of several physically interesting ( and computationally very challenging ) situations involving bfo - related multiferroics in which the present approach can prove to be especially useful .",
    "a particularly interesting possibility pertains to the study of solid solutions , i.e. , bulk mixtures of two or more compounds , at finite temperatures . by assuming simple ( or not so simple ) relations among the free energy of the composite system , the relative proportion between the species , and the vibrational features of the integrating bulk compounds , one may be able to estimate the phase boundaries in the complicated @xmath120-@xmath29-@xmath36 phase diagrams at reasonably modest computational effort . in this regard ,",
    "the bifeo@xmath0-bicoo@xmath0 and bifeo@xmath0-lafeo@xmath0 solid solutions emerge as particularly attractive cases , since the application electric fields in suitably prepared materials can potentially trigger the switching between different ferroelectric - ferroelectric and ferroelectric - paraelectric phases.@xcite    beyond possible applications , studying the bifeo@xmath0-bicoo@xmath0 solid solution is by itself very interesting . on the one hand , this is a case involving transitions between phases that are very dissimilar structurally ( super - tetragonal and quasi - rhombohedral ) , and which have different magnetic orders ( c - afm and g - afm ) . hence , in this case we can expect spin - phonon effects to have a larger impact in the free energy , which would allow us to better test the spin - phonon quasi - harmonic approach that we have introduced in the present work .",
    "additionally , the treatment of the c - afm order requires a more complicated model of exchange interactions , involving at least two ( preferably three@xcite ) coupling constants .",
    "hence , treating c - afm phases requires a extension of the scheme here presented , so that it can easily tackle more general situations .",

    "<S> we have used first - principles methods to investigate the phase diagram of multiferroic bismuth ferrite ( bifeo@xmath0 or bfo ) , revealing the energetic and vibrational features that control the occurrence of various relevant structures . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we have studied the relative stability of four low - energy bfo polymorphs by computing their free energies within the quasi - harmonic approximation , introducing a practical scheme that allows us to account for the main effects of spin disorder . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , we find that the ferroelectric ground state of the material ( with @xmath1 space group ) transforms into an orthorhombic paraelectric phase ( @xmath2 ) upon heating . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this transition is not significantly affected by magnetic disorder , and that the occurrence of the @xmath2 structure relies on its being vibrationally ( although not elastically ) softer than the @xmath1 phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate a representative member of the family of _ nano - twinned _ polymorphs recently predicted for bfo [ prosandeev _ et al_. , adv . </S>",
