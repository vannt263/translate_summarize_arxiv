    "the clouds of gas responsible for the narrow line emission in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the so - called narrow line region ( nlr ) , are supposed to be placed at large distances from the central source , typically from tens of pc to kpc , where the potential well of the supermassive black - hole ( smbh ) is too weak to induce high velocity motion . nevertheless , even at these large distances , the agn emission is thought to be the main source of excitation for the nlr clouds ( e.g. see osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "the nlr is often considered as a good indicator of the isotropic emission of the agn since it should reflect the intensity of the nuclear source independently from its orientation in respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "forbidden emission lines , in particular , like the [ oiii]@xmath05007 are very important as they are not affected by a broad component produced in the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. baskin & laor 2005 ) that agn show a large range of values ( more than 2 orders of magnitude ) of narrow line equivalent width ( ew where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the continuum and total flux respectively .",
    "please note that the continuum flux includes both the agn and the host - galaxy flux . ] ) .",
    "this large spread has been usually interpreted in terms of different physical conditions of the nlr .",
    "the nlr covering factor , in particular , has been considered the main driver for the observed ew ( baskin & laor 2005 ) . however",
    ", other factors can affect the ew of the narrow emission lines .",
    "for instance , it has been recently proposed that the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew in type  1 agn could also be sensitive to the orientation of the accretion disk ( risaliti , salvati & marconi 2010 ) .",
    "another potentially important effect that can influence the value of ew is the absorption due to the molecular torus , postulated by the unified model ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "indeed , since this kind of absorption affects only the continuum emission and not the narrow emission line intensity , we expect a dependence of the observed ew with the amount of obscuration .",
    "the fact that seyfert  2 galaxies typically have [ oiii]@xmath05007  with very large ew ( up to 500 ) supports this idea . since moderate levels of absorption",
    "are often observed also in type  1 agn ( e.g. de zotti & gaskell 1985 ) it is possible that this effect is important for the global class of agn and not just for the most absorbed ones .    in this paper , we want to quantify the importance of the absorption on the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew in all classes of agns , including type  1 sources . to this end , we study the properties of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  emission line in a well - defined flux - limited sample of x - ray selected agn extracted from the xmm-_newton _ bright serendipitous sample ( xbs , della ceca et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the peculiarity of this sample is that , thanks to its relatively bright flux limit , the identification level is very high ( @xmath690% ) thus reducing any possible bias related to the lack of some identifications .",
    "furthermore , for all the agn in the sample xmm-_newton _ x - ray data of medium / good quality are available and a complete and systematic spectral analysis has been already carried out ( corral et al . 2011 ) , providing important pieces of information like the intrinsic hydrogen column density ( n@xmath7 ) and the de - absorbed x - ray luminosity .",
    "we are thus in the position of combining the [ oiii]@xmath05007  properties ( ew , luminosity ) with a measure ( or an upper limit ) of the level of absorption , from the x - ray data .",
    "in section  2 we describe the sample while in section  3 we test whether the large spread of ew observed in the agn of the xbs sample can be due to the intrinsic strenght of the nlr . in section  4",
    "we study the impact of the obscuration on the observed [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew . in section  5",
    "we use numerical simulations to test in a quantitative way the hypothesis that the absorption has an important role on the observed ew of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  also in type  1 agn . in section  6",
    "we compare the predictions of our models with those of the disk - orientation model .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section  7 .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume @xmath8=65 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10=0.7 and @xmath11=0.3 .",

    "2004 ) is a wide - angle ( @xmath128 sq .",
    "deg ) high galactic latitude ( @xmath1220 @xmath13 ) survey based on the xmm-_newton _ archival data .",
    "it is composed of two samples both flux - limited ( @xmath17@xmath1410@xmath15 erg @xmath16 s@xmath9 ) in two separate energy bands : the `` soft '' 0.5 - 4.5 kev band ( the bss sample ) and the hard 4.5 - 7.5 kev band ( the hbss sample ) .",
    "a total of 237 ( 211 for the hbss sample ) independent fields have been used to select 400 sources , 389 belonging to the bss sample and 67 to the hbss sample ( 56 sources are in common ) .",
    "the details on the fields selection strategy , the source selection criteria and the general properties of the 400 objects are discussed in della ceca et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "one of the main goals of the survey is to provide a well - defined and statistically complete census of the agn population with particular attention to the problem of obscuration . to this end",
    ", the possibility of comparing x - ray and optical spectra of good quality for all the sources present in the two complete samples offers a unique and fundamental tool to statistically study the effect of absorption in the agn population in an unbiased way .",
    "indeed , most of the x - ray sources of the xbs survey have been detected with enough counts to allow a reliable x - ray spectral analysis .",
    "the systematic analysis of the x - ray spectra of all the extragalactic sources is presented in corral et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . at the same time , most of the sources have a relatively bright ( r@xmath1722 mag ) optical counterpart and they have been spectroscopically characterized using 4-meters - class telescopes . to date , the spectroscopic identification level has reached 92% .",
    "the results of the spectroscopic campaigns are discussed in caccianiga et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) .    in total",
    ", the xbs sample contains about 300 agn out of which 169 have a redshift low enough ( below @xmath10.7 ) to allow the sampling of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  emission line in the optical spectrum .",
    "this is the sample that we will analyse in the following sections . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we will use agns from both bss and hbss sample while , for the numerical simulations ( section  5 ) we will use only the agn in the bss in order to have a simple and clear selection method that is an important requirement for this type of analysis .",
    "consistently with what is observed in other agn samples , among the xbs agn we find a very wide range of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew . considering all types of agn the observed values of ew range from a few   up to @xmath1500 .",
    "if we restrict the analysis just to the type  1 agn the range is somewhat smaller ( from a few   up to @xmath1150 ) but still very broad .",
    "an intrinsic dispersion on the values of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew is expected due to the variety of properties of the narrow line region .",
    "for instance the nlr covering factor is a parameter that is expected to influence the strenght of the narrow emission lines in respect to the agn continuum emission , and therefore their equivalent widths ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ; baskin & laor 2005 ) .    in order to test the hypothesis that the observed ew spread is related to an intrinsically high luminosity of the nlr ( in respect to the luminosity of the central source ) we have searched for correlation between the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew of the agn and the [ oiii]@xmath05007  luminosity , normalized to the x - ray ( de - absorbed ) luminosity .",
    "the reason for using the de - absorbed x - ray luminosity as a reference is to have an independent indicator of the agn luminosity , already corrected for the absorption10@xmath18 @xmath16 , i.e. for the so - called compton - thick agns , the computed x - ray luminosity could be strongly under estimated ( of two orders of magnitude or more ) since the absorption cut - off can not be recognized in a 0.5 - 10 kev spectrum . however , using the available diagnostics we have shown in corral et al .",

    "this correlation is confirmed by a spearman s rank correlation analysis ( see tab .  [ correlation ] ) . in principle , the observed correlation could be - at least in part - induced by the fact that both [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew and l[oiii]/l[2 - 10kev ] ratio depend on the same quantity ( l[oiii ] ) . in order to test this possibilty",
    "we have applied the partial correlation analysis ( kendall & stuart 1979 ) that estimates the level of correlation between two variables excluding the effect of a third variable .",

    "the most obvious interpretation of this effect is that the covering factor of the nlr can vary significantly from source to source , as suggested by other authors ( e.g. baskin & laor 2005 ; risaliti , salvati & marconi 2010 ) .",

    "the correlation observed between the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew and n@xmath7/optical classification suggests a possible use of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew as a simple proxy to classify a source as type  1/type  2 or unabsorbed / absorbed agn .",
    "this may be very useful for the identification of faint sources in deep surveys .",

    "we have computed the average value of the absolute magnitudes observed for the type 1 agn considered here ( @xmath24 - 22.7 ) and assumed an average host - galaxy absolute magnitude equal to m@xmath25 ( = @xmath2621 , brown et al .",
    "these two values yield an expected average agn / galaxy ratio at 4050  ( rest - frame ) ( @xmath27 ) of @xmath115 . this parameter is expected to be very different , source by source , spanning more than 2 orders of magnitude ( see discussion in caccianiga et al .",

    "we have fixed the agn - to - host galaxy ratio to the expected average value . in principle",

    "if the dust from the host galaxy influences equally both the continuum and the nlr emission then we expect that the net effect on the equivalent width of [ oiii]@xmath05007  is null . under this condition the model described here , that assumes a different effect of the absorption on the continuum and the emission line flux , can not be applied . if , on the contrary , the host galaxy is not able to completely hide the nlr , as suggested by some studies ( e.g. keel 1980",
    "; de zotti and gaskell 1985 ) , then we must expect a net effect on the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew similar to that predicted from the dusty torus .",

    "we conclude that the observed high values of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew ( @xmath640 ) in type  1 agn can be consistently explained as the result of the effect of a mild obscuration ( 10@xmath21 @xmath35n@xmath204@xmath1410@xmath21 @xmath16 ) probably due to the molecular torus .",
    "in a recent paper , risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) have suggested that the distribution of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew in type  1 agn contains information on the orientation of the accretion disk in respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "indeed , since the emission from a disk is not isotropic , the observed optical continuum is expected to decrease for large observing angles ( in respect to the normal ) while the line flux is supposed not to vary with the inclination . as a consequence ,",
    "we expect a variation of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew with the accretion disk orientation . by means of a comparison between",

    "this result , if confirmed , would imply that the orientations of the molecular torus and of the disk are not coupled or that the torus opening angle is very large otherwise it would not be possible to observe high disk inclinations because of the presence of the obscuring medium . according to risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) , the strong evidence for the disk - inclination model is the slope ( = @xmath263.5 ) observed in the ew distribution above 40 - 50 .",

    "the dashed line represents the slope of the tail at high ew observed in the sdss sample of type  1 agn discussed in risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) .",
    "please note that , in order to facilitate the comparison with the plots in risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) the binning adopted in this figure is linear while in the previous figure the binning is logarithmic.,width=340 ]    in the previous sections we have presented evidences that the `` tail '' above 40  of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew distribution in the type  1 agn of the bss sample could be due to the effect of the absorption ( likely related to the molecular torus ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to evaluate if this effect can be important also for the sdss sample .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the critical values of n@xmath7 are those above 10@xmath21 @xmath16 . in principle",
    "it is not clear whether the selection criteria adopted in the sdss sample have an impact on the n@xmath7 distribution , for type  1 agn .",
    "therefore , it is important first of all to check whether in the sdss sample used by risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) there are sources with n@xmath2210@xmath21 @xmath16 . in young , elvis & risaliti ( 2009 )",
    "it is presented the x - ray analysis of a subsample of the sdss quasar sample containing the sources falling serendipitously in xmm-_newton _ fields .",
    "considering only the @xmath1120 sources with redshift below 0.8 ( to match the sample used by risaliti , salvati & marconi 2010 ) we count 10 sources with a detected value of n@xmath2210@xmath21 @xmath16 plus 26 sources with an upper limit on n@xmath7 above 10@xmath21 @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the percentage of agns in the sdss with n@xmath2210@xmath21 @xmath16 ranges from 8% up to 30% . in the bss sample we have estimated that the fraction of type  1 agn with n@xmath2210@xmath21 @xmath16 is similar ( about 20% , taking into account the upper limits through the survival analysis ) .",
    "we thus expect that also in the sdss sample the impact of the absorption on the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew distribution is important .",
    "we now want to quantify this statement by using the numerical simulations described in the previous section .",
    "in particular , we want to see whether the slope of -3.5 observed in the sdss sample can be similarly reproduced also by a model where the absorption , and not the disk - orientation , is the principal driver for the observed ew distribution .",
    "the intrinsic distribution , important for both models below 40 , has a different shape / parametrization in the bss and the sdss sample .",
    "as explained above we have used a single gaussian centered at 12   and a @xmath32=8 while risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) used two gaussians . for consistency with the work by risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) we have adopted the same intrinsic distribution used in their paper .",
    "the second piece of information required to run the simulations is the observed distribution of n@xmath7 . since the fraction of type  1 agn with n@xmath2210@xmath21 @xmath16 is similar in the two sample it is reasonable to use the same n@xmath7 distribution derived from the bss sample .    in figure  [ simula_ty1_risaliti ]",
    "we have reported the results of the simulations .",
    "as a reference , it is also plotted the slope -3.5 observed in the sdss sample .",
    "it is clear that : 1 ) the presence of sources with large values of n@xmath7 is expected to produce a significant tail of ew above 40 - 50  and 2 ) the predicted slope for ew@xmath640 - 50  is consistent with the one observed in the sdss sample .",
    "we conclude that the hypothesis that the absorption is the main driver for the observed ew of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  could be valid also for the sdss sample of type  1 agn .",
    "it is also possible that both absorption and disk - orientation effects co - exist in the same sample . in this case , in order to infer information on the disk inclination it is necessary to properly take into account the effect of absorption on the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew .",
    "we have studied the equivalent widths of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  narrow emission line in a sample of @xmath1170 x - ray selected agn taken from the xmm-_newton _ bright survey .",
    "we have combined optical and x - ray information in order to understand the origin of the observed large range of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew values ( from a few   up to 500 ) and , in particular , to quantify the importance of absorption .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * the values of ew correlate with the luminosity of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  normalized to the ( de - absorbed ) x - ray luminosity , at least up to ew@xmath140 - 50 .",
    "this suggests that the values of [ oiii]@xmath05007  from @xmath11  up to 40 - 50  are determined by the intrinsic strength of the nlr ( related , for instance , to the nlr covering factor ) . above ew=40 - 50",
    "the correlation does not hold anymore . in this range of ew",
    "we have both type  1 and type  2 agns ; * we have found a strong dependence of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew with the absorbing column density , n@xmath7 , derived from the x - ray spectra . on average ,",
    "sources with low values of n@xmath7 ( @xmath1710@xmath21 @xmath16 ) present low average values of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew ( @xmath120 ) while sources presenting large column densities ( n@xmath2210@xmath23 @xmath16 ) have the largest values of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew ( up to @xmath1500 ) .",
    "this trend is well explained in the context of the agn unified model , which postulates a connection between optical and x - ray absorption ( due to the putative molecular torus ) : in this framework the increase of the [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew with n@xmath7 is simply caused by the decrease of the optical continuum beneath the line due to its progressive obscuration . in this sense ,",
    "the value of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew is a rough indicator of the orientation of the agn ( in respect to the torus opening angle ) and can be used as simple proxy for the optical / x - ray classification of an agn ( type1/type2 or unobscured / obscured agn ) although not very efficient in identifying all the type  2/absorbed agns ( completeness level @xmath140% ) ; * by means of numerical simulations we have demonstrated that the observed distribution of [ oiii]@xmath05007  ew of type  1 agn is well reproduced by combining an intrinsic distribution ( a symmetric gaussian centered at ew=12  and a @xmath32=8 ) with the distribution of absorption derived from the x - ray analysis .",
    "we conclude that also in type  1 agn the effect of absorption is important and produces [ oiii]@xmath05007  lines with large ew ( between 40  and 100 ) .",
    "* the combination of intrinsic ew distribution and mild ( n@xmath7 of a few 10@xmath21 @xmath16 ) absorption seems to be a valid explanation also for what is observed in the sdss sample considered by risaliti , salvati & marconi ( 2010 ) and thus represents an alternative to the disk - inclination hypothesis , although we can not exclude that both effects are at work in the sample .",
