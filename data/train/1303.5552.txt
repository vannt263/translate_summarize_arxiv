    "systemic risk can be generally described as the risk that a failing agent ( e.g. a bank in a financial system or a firm in a supply system ) causes the failure of other agents such that failing cascades may encompass the whole system @xcite .",
    "this approach differs from other notions of risk @xcite which treat the default of individual agents as an extreme event for which the probability is calculated regardless of the interaction among economic agents .",
    "instead , a systemic notion of risk requires to explicitly take into account two ingredients : ( a ) the stability condition of individual agents , and ( b ) the impact of interactions between agents on their mutual stability . in this paper",
    ", we apply this systemic perspective to analyze the stability of a banking system , dependent on the leverage and diversification of individual banks .",
    "the stability of a single bank is commonly expressed by the composition of its balance sheet and measured by the _ leverage _",
    ", e.g. by the debt - to - asset ratio . to quantify stability",
    ", we calculate the individual default probability using the well established structural framework by @xcite in which the firm s leverage plays a major role .",
    "this approach has become popular among both academicians and practitioners thanks to its tractability and simplicity . for a survey see @xcite .",
    "moreover , the financial stability @xcite recommends it as a building block in establishing a regulatory framework that can cope with risk from systemic linkages .",
    "these linkages arise from bilateral exposures ( e.g. mutual claims ) and common assets which may lead to interlocking balance sheets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . including these effects into a systemic notion of risk requires explicit knowledge of banks balance sheets and their change over time .",
    "this information is mostly confidential , due to strategic issues , and therefore unattainable for a system comprised of many banks . to avoid the trap of insufficient data",
    ", we study the mutual impact of failing banks by calculating their joint default probability ( hereafter , `` systemic default probability '' ) based on their individual default probabilities , as defined by the merton framework , and their _ asset correlation_.",
    "we assume that risk - averse banks hold diversified portfolios in order to mitigate their individual default risk .",
    "therefore , in a market with a finite number of ( uncorrelated ) investment opportunities , also called projects , asset correlation among banks increases with diversification due to overlapping portfolios .",
    "@xcite identifies similar portfolios , or `` crowding '' , as a destabilizing mechanism in financial markets .    in our paper",
    ", we particularly focus on the impact of _ excessive leverage _ and _ diversification _ on the systemic default probability and their possible interdependence .",
    "excessive leverage refers to the practice of banks to engage in huge debt to buy more assets , in order to increase their return on equity . as the financial service authority @xcite and the financial stability board @xcite",
    "jointly point out , excessive leverage by banks increases systemic risk .",
    "however , our hypothesis is that diversification can compensate some of the hazards of excessive leverage , under optimal conditions . in our paper",
    "we identify two different regimes : ( i ) a _ safe _ regime in which an increase of leverage can be compensated by a proper diversification strategy , leading to a low systemic default probability , and ( ii ) a _ risky _ regime in which the same increase of leverage will lead to an increase of the systemic default probability , because the diversification strategy is not adequate and/or the market conditions are adverse .",
    "the latter consider , in our model , the size of the market , the market risk as measured by the volatility , and the time horizon .",
    "the boundary between the two regimes is , in our model , given by a critical level of diversification , @xmath0 , which depends on the market size @xmath1 , the market conditions , @xmath2 ( which also include the volatility and the time horizon ) , and two leverages , referring to a normal ( @xmath3 ) and an abnormal ( @xmath4 ) level .",
    "the safe regime is given by @xmath5 , whereas the risky regime is the opposite .",
    "we show that @xmath6 increases with @xmath1 .",
    "this seems to be counter - intuitive because the larger the market , the less should be the portfolio overlap for a given level of diversification .",
    "however , this only holds if @xmath7 is above the critical level of diversification . with",
    "increasing market size , banks have to reach a larger level of diversification in order to be on the safe side .",
    "secondly , we show that excessive leverage expands the risky regime and therefore the critical level of diversification .",
    "interestingly , there is not always a combination of leverage and diversification to reach the safe regime .",
    "even with increasing market size , the market conditions may prevent this , thus the systemic default probability is not reduced .",
    "our paper contributes to several research lines .",
    "first , we show a different way of how the well established @xcite model can be extended to joint defaults .",
    "second , we extend the previous literature on the optimal diversification level pioneered by @xcite and @xcite to a systemic context .",
    "this allows to better understand the controversial relation between the firm capital structure and diversification @xcite .",
    "finally , our work complements existing theoretical literature that , after the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis , started to investigate the role of risk diversification for the stability of the financial system @xcite .",
    "our results about a critical level of diversification can be used for improving macro - prudential regulations , for example by enforcing a ceiling to excessive leverage .",
    "we extend the @xcite framework to a set of @xmath8 banks such that for each bank @xmath9 the following balance - sheet identity holds true at any time @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the market value of bank @xmath13 s assets .",
    "@xmath14 is the promised payment of its liabilities at maturity date @xmath15 .. ] finally , @xmath16 is the equity value which keeps the two sides of the balance sheet even .",
    "the debt - to - asset ratio , @xmath17 captures the different capital structure between banks and @xmath18 can be seen as an approximate measure of the credit quality of a bank .",
    "the objective of a risk - averse bank is to increase its asset value per unit of risk .",
    "the latter results from investing in a number non - divisible risky projects @xmath19 , i.e. activities related to the real - economy such as loans to firms and households , infrastructure projects , or real - estate investments .",
    "each of these projects has a certain price value per unit , @xmath20 at time @xmath10 .",
    "if this price has decreased compared to the initial price @xmath21 , banks face a loss , and they gain in the opposite case .",
    "if at time @xmath22 bank @xmath13 acquires @xmath23 units of project @xmath24 at a price @xmath21 , its asset is given by : @xmath25 the investment position of bank @xmath13 at @xmath22 is denoted by the vector @xmath26 of risky projects . in this paper , we assume that bank @xmath13 invests the same proportion of its assets in each of the projects , i.e. @xmath27=const . for all @xmath28 , which implies that eq .",
    "( [ eq : asset ] ) simplifies to @xmath29 , which holds for every project @xmath24",
    "bank @xmath13 invested in .",
    "consequently , each bank initially has a different leverage ratio @xmath30 and a different diversification expressed by the _ number _",
    "@xmath31 of projects to invest : @xmath32 we have assumed here that diversification is not with respect to the _ type _ of projects chosen , but only with respect to their number . that means that projects , from this perspective , are indistinguishable and uncorrelated , so we also assume that they have the same initial price @xmath33 .    the balance - sheet identity ( [ eq:36 ] ) has to be guaranteed at any time @xmath10 , which implies @xmath34 for the asset side to hold true .",
    "since the fraction of assets allocated to each project is kept constant over time , bank @xmath13 has to adjust the number of units @xmath35 in its portfolio with respect to the price changes @xmath36 . in practice , at each trading date , the asset allocation is revised such that , after rebalancing , the amount invested in each of the projects is again @xmath37 .",
    "that is , bank @xmath13 holds the investment position @xmath38 during the period @xmath39 $ ] and liquidates it at the prevailing prices at time @xmath10 .",
    "simultaneously bank @xmath13 sets up the new portfolio @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 represents a `` contrarian '' asset allocation strategy because the portfolio is rebalanced by selling `` winners '' and buying `` losers '' at any time @xmath10 according to the formula @xmath42 for each project @xmath24 in @xmath38 . as in @xcite ,",
    "the price dynamics is given by a geometric brownian motion of the form @xmath43 the random shocks @xmath44 follow a standard brownian motion defined on a complete filtered probability space ( @xmath45 ) , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for all pairs @xmath48 in the set of risky projects .",
    "the drift term @xmath49 describes the instantaneous risk - adjusted expected growth rate , and @xmath50 is the volatility of the growth rate .",
    "both @xmath49 and @xmath51 are the same for all projects because they are indistinguishable . despite projects",
    "are uncorrelated , diversification increases the likelihood of having overlapping portfolios between bank @xmath13 and @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the asset correlation in the portfolios of banks @xmath13 and @xmath52 .    using the expression @xmath55",
    ", we arrive after some transformations at the following dynamics for the asset side of bank @xmath13 : @xmath56 for each bank @xmath13 the dynamics is then as follows : initially it selects a certain _ strategy _ , defined as @xmath57 , which contains the chosen leverage @xmath58 and the number @xmath59 of risky projects , in each of which it invests the same proportion of assets .",
    "the bank holds the selected portfolio and locks the proportion of assets allocated to each project until time @xmath15 .",
    "given the stochastic nature of the price dynamics and the risk associated with this , the bank has to estimate the optimal combination of leveraging and diversification across the set of @xmath1 risky projects .",
    "this problem will be addressed in the next section .      following the structural approach proposed by @xcite ,",
    "we assume that the default occurs if the asset value of bank @xmath13 at debt maturity date @xmath15 falls beneath the book value of its debt , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "more formally , given the probability space ( @xmath61 ) , the default probability @xmath62 of the bank @xmath13 using strategy @xmath57 is at the end of the period @xmath15 defined as : @xmath63=    \\mathbb{p}[\\mathrm{ln}(a_i(t))\\leq \\mathrm{ln}(h_i ) \\mid a_i(0)=a_{i0 } ]   = \\phi_{1}(z_{i } ) % \\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{ln}(1/f_{i})- \\frac{\\chi}{n_i } } % { \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\chi}{n_i } } }      \\right ) \\:,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the standard cumulative normal distribution function with the argument @xmath65 the constant @xmath2 combines the effects of asset volatility and time to maturity .",
    "the probability of bankruptcy depends on the distance between the current asset value @xmath66 and the debt value @xmath67 , adjusted for the expected growth in asset value , @xmath49 , relative to asset volatility , @xmath51 .",
    "we verify that the default probability is increasing in @xmath68 , decreasing in @xmath69 and , for @xmath70 , increasing in @xmath71 , which is in line with economic intuition .",
    "then , increasing asset diversification ( i.e. , letting @xmath72 ) is desirable since it lowers @xmath64 , _",
    "ceteris paribus_. the individual default probability ( [ eq:40 ] ) refers to the default of a bank irrespective of the default of other banks .",
    "however , in order to quantify systemic risk , we have to specifically address the impact of the default of one bank on another bank . in this paper , we extend the approach by @xcite by calculating this impact based on the above considerations . for simplicity , we consider only two banks in the first place and further assume the expected growth to be zero , @xmath73 .",
    "a possible extension of the framework to @xmath8 banks is feasible ( see e.g. , @xcite ) and is further discussed in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "also the systemic effects of a `` booming '' market , @xmath74 , compared to those of a `` crashing '' market , @xmath75 , are discussed later .",
    "systemic default occurs whenever banks @xmath76 and @xmath77 jointly default at the end of period @xmath15 .",
    "more formally , given the probability space ( @xmath61 ) , the systemic default probability @xmath78 of the banking system consisting of two banks @xmath79 is defined as : @xmath80 @xmath81 is the standard bivariate cumulative normal distribution function and @xmath82 is the asset correlation between bank @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which results from the fact that both may have invested into the same risky project .",
    "the calculation of eq .",

    "remarkably , @xmath135 ( see the lines that separate the black from the gray areas in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) . in other terms , conditional on the market size @xmath1 and market properties @xmath2 , @xmath6 represents the _ minimum _ number of risky projects each bank has to hold in order to prevent the increase of systemic risk from excessive leverage .",
    "as figure [ fig:2 ] indicates , @xmath6 increases monotonously with market size @xmath1 , i.e. , a bigger market requires more diversification .",
    "moreover , we can show that @xmath6 increases for `` crashing '' markets , @xmath136 , and decreases for `` booming '' markets , @xmath74 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ [ market - size ] ] market size : + + + + + + + + + + + +    we can observe both from figure [ fig:2 ] and from table [ div_benefits ] that an increasing market size @xmath1 results in an increasing number of projects to be chosen and hold for optimal diversification .",
    "hence , larger markets bear more risk which has to be compensated . indeed , despite the fact that broader markets in which banks can choose from a bigger pool of projects allow for better diversification possibilities , they also reduce the effectiveness of diversification .",
    "that is because the boundary @xmath143 increases with the market size . in this",
    "context , systemic risk can be hardly contained through diversification .",
    "it could be more interesting , however , to discuss the _ relative risk _",
    ", i.e. the ratio of the black area ( where systemic risk has increased with leverage increase ) over the gray area ( where systemic risk is independent of leverage and diversification ) .",
    "it appears that the relative risk _ decreases _ with increasing market size .",
    "i.e. , for larger markets it becomes more likely to invest in projects such that banks 1 and 2 become independent enough with respect to their diversification strategy .",
    "for @xmath7 randomly chosen projects , a larger market reduces the risk of systemic default , provided that @xmath7 is above the critical number @xmath6 .",
    "[ [ leverage - and - market - risk ] ] leverage and market risk : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    comparing both sides of figure [ fig:2 ] , we observe that the black area increases if the excessive leverage @xmath126 increases .",
    "this also holds for increasing absolute leverage values ( not shown ) .",
    "however , it is worth to note that the impact of leverage is not as severe as one might expect .",
    "its influence becomes noticeable mainly for higher values of @xmath2 , i.e. for extreme market risks .",
    "instead , in less volatile markets , i.e. for moderate market risks , the relative impact of the leverage decreases .",
    "the main message drawn from the above consideration is the emergence of two market regimes : the _ safe _ regime in which excessive leverage in the market does not increase systemic risk ( gray areas ) and the _ risky _ regime in which excessive leverage in the market does increase systemic risk ( black areas ) .",
    "there are two complementary ways to move from the risky to the safe regime .",
    "first , for a given market condition @xmath2 , banks should increase their level of diversification at least up to @xmath6 ( outward movement along the @xmath7 axis in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "second , for a given diversification level @xmath7 , the market should become less risky ( inward movement along the @xmath2 axis in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ) .    our results already allow us to discuss changes in the basic assumptions that underlie the @xcite model .",
    "so far , we have assumed that there are no correlations between projects .",
    "if these are taken into account , the boundary @xmath143 should rise dramatically to a level that may be difficult to achieve by some market participants , especially if the market size is very big .",
    "this effect should even further increase if we take into account the costs for monitoring and transaction of the projects .",
    "such costs are expected to increase with @xmath7 and thus also lead to an increase in @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , the estimation given in this paper should be considered as the minimum value . at the same time , this is also the optimal diversification level because it warrants to be in the safe regime at the minimal cost .",
    "our model could be extended to the more general case of @xmath8 banks , which may be heterogeneous in terms of leverage and diversification strategies @xmath57 .",
    "this would lead to an increasing complexity of the analysis .",
    "however the general findings of the paper would qualitatively remain the same because such generalizations do not increase the degree of freedom for the banks , i.e. their set of strategies . at this point",
    ", we can already argue that the impact of the heterogeneity in strategies is as follows : if some banks choose a high level of leverage , this increases @xmath6 .",
    "this in turn forces those other banks with lower leverage to choose a larger diversification level , to compensate for this , i.e. it creates negative externalities in the system .",
    "financial institutions such as banks use different strategies to run their businesses . in this paper , we consider two of them , namely leverage and diversification .",
    "the first one allows banks to increase their expected return on equity based on debt financed investments .",
    "the second one is used to mitigate losses from such investments .",
    "hence , both strategies have a different impact on the default probability of a bank : leverage amplifies the default risk , while diversification reduces it . in a finite market banks",
    "can not choose completely independent diversification strategies . instead , their portfolios overlap with diversification , which correlates the default probability of individual banks .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in the impact of these strategies on the systemic default probability , i.e. the probability of joint defaults .",
    "in particular , we answer the question if and how an increase of individual risk , due to excessive leverage , leads to an increase of the systemic default probability , and if and how this can be mitigated by an optimal diversification level . as the main result",
    ", we determine the boundary between two market regimes : a safe regime in which excess leverage _ can _ be mitigated by better diversification , thus _ not _ resulting in an increase of systemic risk , and a risky regime in which this is not possible resulting in increased systemic risk .",
    "our findings contribute to the ongoing discussions of the optimal regulatory framework for financial markets .",
    "the question , whether benefits from diversification can offset the systemic risk , due to excessive leverage , can be answered by means of our distinction between risky and safe conditions .",
    "this also extends to the question whether capital requirements should be lowered for institutions with more diversified investments . here",
    ", we show that a critical level of diversification exists which depends on the market size and the market conditions and thus needs to be monitored to prevent a transitions toward the risky regime .",
    "such insights can be used to improve macro - prudential regulations , such as the current basel iii risk - based framework , which is portfolio invariant , i.e. , does not consider the role for diversification . as",
    "a conclusion from our results , portfolio invariance leads to a significantly higher maximum leverage ratio allowed for banks in the current regulatory framework , i.e. it can result in a much riskier financial system ."
