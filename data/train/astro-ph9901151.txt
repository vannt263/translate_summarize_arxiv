    "clusters of galaxies are the largest bound structures in the universe . within the hierarchical clustering scenario they were assembled through the merging and fragmentation of smaller size objects , which had collapsed first , within regions @xmath9@xmath10mpc wide .",
    "accordingly , their masses are estimated in the range @xmath11 . their gravitational growth is dominated by collisionless dark matter ( dm ) and the gas distribution follows that of dm .    the outputs of such growth depend on a number of cosmological parameters .",
    "first of all , if the global matter density parameter @xmath12 , the growth of primeval fluctuations is drastically slowed down before the present epoch . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath13 ( vacuum energy density @xmath14 ) , a transition from decelerated to steady cosmological expansion occurs at a redshift slightly later than @xmath15 and this redshift ( @xmath16 ) approximately sets an end to fluctuation growth . if @xmath17 , instead , a freeze of fluctuation growing takes place after vacuum energy density @xmath18 begins to dominate on matter energy density @xmath19 . as @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "also in this case , fluctuations not close enough to turn around by @xmath16 are doomed to quite a slow growing at later epochs .",
    "furthermore , even apart of such late stops to fluctuation growth , a determinant role is played by the shape of the _ transferred _ fluctuation spectrum , which depends on other cosmological parameters , besides of @xmath8 and @xmath22 .",
    "henceforth cosmological parameters shed their influence over the number and space distribution of clusters ( see , @xmath23 , white , efstathiou @xmath0 frenk 1993 ; eke , cole @xmath0 frenk 1996 ) , over their evolution ( see , @xmath23 , jing @xmath0 fang 1994 ; bahcall , fan @xmath0 cen 1997 ; henry 1997 ) , as well as over their morphology .",
    "however , in the last case , hydrodynamics governs gas distribution , gravitation itself is intrinsically non  linear and , a priori , it is hard to state which observed features shall be related to unavoidable kinematical effects and which else are due to initial conditions set up by primeval spectra or , however , to cosmological parameters .",
    "it is therefore clear why attempts to trace back cosmological parameters from data were often concentrated on super  cluster scales .    finding a suitable parameter set to quantify",
    "the global cluster morphology is a non trivial task . in this work",
    "we shall do so using the power ratios , introduced by buote @xmath0 tsai ( 1995 , hereafter bt95 ) , which are essentially related to a multipole expansion accounting for the angle dependence of cluster surface brightness .",
    "we shall see that this is an effective and synthetic way to discriminate cluster features , as the do depend on the cosmological model and discriminate among different cosmologies .",
    "it is quite likely , however , that they do not exhaust the characteristics of clusters which depend on the model .",
    "henceforth , both before and after their introduction , many attempts were performed to provide further useful statistical tools",
    ".    early works in this field tried to find a relation between the radial density profile @xmath24 and the value of @xmath25 .",
    "cen ( 1994 ) and mohr ( 1995 ) obtained a steeper density profile for open models than for critical density .",
    "however , later analyses ( jing 1995 ; crone 1997 ; eke , cole @xmath0 frenk 1996 ; thomas 1998 ) showed that the radial density profile , when scaled to the cluster virial radius , is substantially independent from @xmath25",
    ".    there can be little doubts that these are significant quantities , but their quantitative analysis can be performed only using really wide observational and model samples , in order to span the whole functional space in an appropriate way .    a more promising way to constrain the cosmological model arises from the study of substructures in the inner mass distribution .",
    "this approach has observational support both from internal galaxy distribution ( geller @xmath0 beers 1982 ; dressler @xmath0 shectman 1988 ; west @xmath0 bothun 1990 ; bird 1995 ) and from x  ray image brightness ( jones @xmath0 forman 1992 ; bhringer 1993 ; mohr , fabricant @xmath0 geller 1993 ) .",
    "observed substructures were first compared with those expected within a spherical growth approximation ( richstone , loeb @xmath0 turner 1992 ) , then with those expected within a press  schechter approach , to follow the merger history of subclumps ( kauffman @xmath0 white 1993 ; lacey @xmath0 cole 1993 ) .",
    "cosmological simulations , however , are the most natural method to compare substructure evolution in different models . early simulations ( evrard 1993 ; mohr 1995 ) showed that the fraction of substructure in galaxy clusters is negligible in low ",
    "density cdm models , thus favoring a cosmology with @xmath26 . jing ( 1995 ) , instead , found a large fraction of galaxy clusters with substructures in   models with @xmath27 .",
    "an attempt to find a more synthetic parameterization of the degree of inhomogeneity was made by crone , evrard & richstone ( 1996 ) , who used the displacement of the centre of mass as a function of the overdensity level to quantify the amount of cluster substructures in different cosmological models .",
    "henceforth , they conclude that the center of mass analysis is a good test to discriminate among different models , while previous tests suggested by fitchett & webster ( 1987 ) and dressler @xmath0 shectman ( 1988 ) do not perform so well .    other statistical approaches , trying to quantity substructures , are the moment of the distributions ( dutta 1995 ) and the hierarchical clustering method ( serna @xmath0 gerbal 1996 , gurzadyan @xmath0 mazure 1998 ) .",
    "they all confirm that the level of substructure of galaxy clusters is quite sensitive to the underlying cosmological models , although their capacity to discriminate among them is often rather ambiguous . in our opinion ,",
    "as already outlined , the most promising method is based on the so  called _ power ratios _ and amounts to a multipole expansion of the two  dimensional potential generating the observed surface brightness .",
    "further detail on their definition and significance are given in the next section , where we shall also discuss the observational material on which their analysis can be based .",
    "as a matter of fact , complete maps of optical surface brightness or , let alone , projected mass density ( obtained , @xmath23 , using gravitational lensing ) are unavailable .",
    "henceforth buote & tsai ( 1996 , hereafter bt96 ) used maps of x  ray surface brightness , which trace the squared baryon density distribution .",
    "previous work in this field , besides of using available observational material , made also use of outputs of simulations already performed for different aims .",
    "they amounted to 6 hydro simulation for cdm model , and to a set of n  body simulations for various cosmological models .",
    "the effectiveness of the approach , however , calls for better observational material and simulations . in this paper",
    "we try to fulfill such requirements for what concerns simulations , running three sets of 40 cluster models , for different cosmological models , with a treesph code .",
    "we compare their outputs with observations using , first of all , the statistical tests used in previous work .",
    "however , some statistical tests will also be suitably improved , obtaining a higher discriminatory power .",
    "it is also important to stress that we compared our results , based on baryon distributions , with those obtainable from the same clusters , if dm distributions are used .",
    "we find that , systematically , structures in gas are less pronounced than in dm . replacing n  body simulations with treesph simulations",
    "is therefore a substantial step forward and does lead to a different score for the cosmological models considered .    in our opinion , however , a final word on model rating , based on   analysis , can not yet be said .",
    "this is not only due to the limits of available observational material , whose biases we try to reproduce in our model analysis .",
    "rather , some of improved statistical tests considered show no agreement between data and any of the cosmological model considered . in spite of that , we can safely state that , from this kind of analysis ,    models come out disfavored ; standard cdm and the chdm mix considered here ( which , unlike cdm , fits also cobe quadrupole data and has a fair spectral shape parameter @xmath28 ) are certainly closer to observations .",
    "however , in our opinion a general fit of data can be expected for some different dm mix different and/or for open cdm models .",
    "the plan of the paper will be given now . in sec .",

    "we assume that the x  ray intensity received by @xmath29 pspc ( pfeffermann 1987 ) arises from thermal bremsstrahlung and , therefore , is @xmath30 . in principle",
    ", the coefficient @xmath8 depends both on the temperature @xmath31 and on the geometry of the source .",
    "however , the number of photons collected by @xmath29 pspc does not depend on @xmath31 , provided that @xmath32kev ( see , @xmath23 , nra 91ossa3 , appendix f : @xmath29 mission description ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath33 shall be used in quantities whose _ ratios _ will be compared with data and , therefore , the absolute value of @xmath8 does not appear in the final expressions .",
    "henceforth , the values of  from a model cluster are obtained as follows ( here we shall report a procedure fully consistent with bt95 , bt96 , tsai @xmath0 buote 1996 , hereafter tb , and buote @xmath0 xu 1997 , hereafter bx ) : ( i ) @xmath34 [ which is @xmath35 is projected on a plane @xmath36 , chosen at random , to yield the @xmath37ray surface brightness @xmath38 ( the direction @xmath39 , orthogonal to @xmath40 , defines the _ line of sight _ ; @xmath41 and @xmath42 are cartesian coordinates on @xmath40 ) .",

    "owing to the definition of the centroid @xmath43 , @xmath55 vanishes",
    ". henceforth , also @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we shall restrict our analysis to @xmath57 , to account for   on scales not much below @xmath58 itself , and this leaves us with only 3 significant ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "because of its evolution , a cluster moves along a curve of the 3dimensional space spanned by such s ; this curve is called _ evolutionary track_. we shall also consider its 2dimensional projections .",
    "quite in general , a cluster starts from a configuration away from the origin , corresponding to a large amount of internal structure and evolves towards isotropization and homogeneization .",
    "this motion , however , does not occur with a steady trend : sudden bursts of structure appear , when matter lumps approach the cluster potential well , and eventually fade as lumps are absorbed by it .",
    "gradually , however , the evolutionary track approaches the origin , as can be easily appreciated by averaging over the contributions of several clusters .",
    "actual data , of course , do not follow the motion of a given cluster along the evolutionary track .",
    "different clusters , however , lie at different redshifts and can be used to describe a succession of evolutionary stages .",
    "power ratios for model clusters are to be set in the 3dimensional space spanned by s , taking each model cluster at redshifts distributed as for data clusters .",
    "our data set is the same used by bt96 . among x ",
    "ray cluster images , taken with @xmath29 pspc , and such that the pspc central ring contains a cluster portion whose radius exceeds 400@xmath60kpc , we shall use those contained in the heasarc  legacy database and belonging to the ebeling ( 1993 ) or edge ( 1990 ) samples . out of the 59 objects selected in this way , one can estimate  for 44 of them at @xmath61mpc and for 27 of them at @xmath62mpc .",
    "pspc data give the x  ray surface brightness @xmath63 , which is to be used in the same way as the @xmath47 s obtained from models , to work out  for @xmath64mpc . according to tb",
    ", the resulting sample is partially incomplete , but , clusters were not selected for reasons related to their morphology and the missing clusters are expected to have a distribution of power ratios similar to the observed one .",
    "they also tested this point using results of the imaging proportional counter of the einstein satellite .",
    "we shall later report on the lack of any similar correlation for model clusters .    in fig .",
    "1 we report the redshift distribution of clusters in our data set , for the three values of @xmath58 we use .",
    "we took this into account in our comparison with simulations , at variance with previous analyses .",
    "as we shall better detail in the next section , for each cosmological model we consider , we have outputs for 40 simulated clusters , at a set of redshifts @xmath65 ( see below ) .",
    "this enables us to select simulation outputs so to reproduce the @xmath66distribution of data using each model cluster only once , @xmath67 at a single @xmath66 value .",
    "this can be done in a large number of ways . among them",
    "we randomly select 50 _",
    "cluster sequences_. however , even at this point , we can still choose the line of sight in each model cluster in each _ sequence _ in an arbitrary way .",
    "this is fixed at random , once for all , in each cluster of each sequence .",
    "the cluster sequence selection is independently made for each cosmological model .",
    "in this work we considered three spatially flat cosmological models , that we shall indicate cdm ,   and .",
    "the hubble parameter , normalized to 100@xmath68 , is @xmath69 for cdm and , and @xmath70 for  ; for all models the primeval spectral index @xmath71 and the baryon density parameter is selected to give @xmath72 . in",
    "we have 1 massive neutrino with mass @xmath73ev , yielding a hdm density parameter @xmath74 . in ",
    "the vacuum contribution to the energy density is @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , the global density parameter of matter @xmath22 is 1 for cdm and chdm , and 0.3 for  .",

    "as is known , cdm fails this test , but is however an important reference model . for cdm , also the shape parameter @xmath78 ( @xmath79 are mass variances on @xmath80mpc scales )",
    "widely exceeds the observational interval . for apm galaxies ,",
    "in fact , peacock and dodds ( 1994 ) found @xmath81 ; for the abell / aco sample , borgani ( 1997 ) found @xmath28 in the interval 0.180.25 ; on the contrary cdm predicts @xmath82 .  and",

    "the selection of cosmological models was made in order to have simple models with significantly different characteristics .",
    "both for  and  , different parameter choices are possible .",
    "in particular  features are highly dependent on the dm mix considered . the mix taken here",
    "is selected both for its physical significance and to ease simulations .",
    "in fact ,   with light neutrinos is non trivial to simulate , as thermal neutrino velocities rapidly displace hot particles from their initial positions and the hot spectrum on small scales becomes dominated by shot noise . with the parameter choice performed here and in the simulation section , this effect is almost absent in this work .",
    "in order to achieve a safe statistical basis for our analysis , we built 40 simulated clusters for each cosmological model considered .",
    "herebelow we report the details of the simulations , which were a significant part of our work .",
    "the procedure starts from taking a large simulation box , whose side ( @xmath84 ) is fixed in order to provide more than 40 clusters , with mass @xmath85 . in this box",
    "we run a ( purely gravitational ) n  body p3 m simulation for each cosmological model , starting from a redshift @xmath65 . then , using a friend  of  friend ( fof ) algorithm , we located the 40 most massive clusters for each model . for each of them , restarting from @xmath65 , we performed a hydrodynamical treesph simulation in spheres of radius @xmath86@xmath87 ) .",
    "let us first describe the cosmological n  body simulations .",
    "the pm part of the code makes use of @xmath88 cells . for the pp part of the code the plummer  equivalent softening distance is @xmath89 for all the models .",
    "the particle number is @xmath90 for cdm and   models with @xmath91 , while @xmath92 for    with @xmath93 ( see table 1 ) .",

    "this is expected for @xmath99 ( white 1993 ; biviano 1993 ; eke 1996 ) and in chdm models for @xmath100 ( valdarnini , kahniashvili & novosyadlyj 1998 ) .",
    "this procedure yields @xmath101 , which must fulfill two competing requests : ( i ) in order to apply the zeldovich approximation , the linear lagrangian theory must still be a valid approximation ; this sets a lower limit to @xmath65 , which depends on the model .",
    "( ii ) however , the average particle separation decreases as the scale factor @xmath102 and , at @xmath65 , it risks to approach the gravitational softening length which , in treesph simulations , has a constant physical size .",
    "the values of @xmath96 given in table 1 have been chosen in order to fulfill both constraints .",
    "just for the sake of comparison , in their cdm simulations , navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , hereafter nfw ) have @xmath103 .",

    "this motion does not occur with a steady trend , and bursts of structure appear when further matter lumps approach the cluster potential well , to be absorbed by it .",
    "however , the evolutionary track eventually approaches the origin , and this can be more easily appreciated by averaging over the contributions of several clusters .",
    "actual data , of course , do not show the motion of a single cluster along the evolutionary track .",
    "different clusters , however , lie at different redshifts and , in average , can be expected to describe a succession of evolutionary moments .    in fig .",
    "7 we give 9 plots for the space containing the evolutionary tracks projected on 3 planes and at three different @xmath58 s . for the sake of example , in fig . 7 we describe the behaviour of .",
    "filled dots refer to a single selection of simulated clusters .",
    "their distributions show a linear trend and a linear regression gives place to the straight lines reported in the plots .",
    "crosses , instead , indicate the location of data clusters .",
    "their distributions do not show such a trend as simulated points and are more scattered than  clusters .    a quantitative way to compare the correlations of two 2dimensional distributions on a plane @xmath104 , starts from defining the averages @xmath105 , @xmath106 of @xmath107 and @xmath108 values and the deviations @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "then the linear correlation coefficients read @xmath111 the use of this tool indicates that the probability of obtaining such different correlation coefficients is quite small and would seem to exclude the validity of all models considered",
    ".    there may be a number of reasons for such discrepant behaviours .",
    "the time elapsed from @xmath112 up to now is approximately a quarter of the life of the universe . during such time , galaxies evolve and may acquire different relevance in the overall @xmath37ray emission , the intracluster gas is suitably enriched and/or undergoes complex cooling processes , environmental effects and other physical variables may have had suitable trends .",
    "when evolution is not our aim , measures on samples with similarly weighted contributions from different redshift ranges may keep full significance , while , on the contrary , separating contributions from different @xmath66 values might be demanding too much .",
    "we should therefore refrain from concluding that none of the models inspected fits the ( un)observed evolutionary trend .",
    "we rather suggest that the evolutionary trend in data is ( at least partially ) hidden by other effects .",
    "we seeked a confirm of the latter hypothesis by trying to use a softer statistical approach to compare the evolution shown by simulations with data .",
    "the slope of the straight line in fig .",
    "7 , obtained through a linear regression , is , by definition , a suitably weighted average among the slopes of straight lines through any couple of points .",
    "accordingly , a linear trend is visible as a peak in the slope distribution .",
    "if a similar trend is not completely hidden in data points , a peak should appear also in the distribution of the slopes of lines throught pairs of data points . in fig .",
    "8 we compare the distributions of slopes for data points ( thin histograms ) and for simulated points ( thick histograms ) for cdm and chdm models .",
    "this is done starting from the points shown in fig . 7 for   and for a similar selections for cdm .",
    "fig.s 8 , as expected , show a set of peaks for model clusters , more relevant for greater aperture radii .",
    "let us however outline that some peak structure is also present in data points .",
    "also an eye comparison of cdm and   with data shows that   is substantially favoured . the only plot showing an opposite trend is @xmath113 vs. @xmath114 , with @xmath115 . in a few cases the distributions of   and data seem quite consistent or however strongly favoured , @xmath23 for all plots at @xmath116 .",
    "the probability of agreement , measured through ks coefficients , keeps low ( @xmath11710@xmath118 ) , but the indication in favour of   in respect to cdm is significant .",
    "we do not show analogous plots for  , which turns out to be disfavoured in this test , based on gas distribution .",
    "[ fig : track ]    [ fig : ang2 ]    it would be unwise to draw any final conclusions on the basis of this test . in our opinion , data need to be significantly improved and enriched before that this kind of analysis may become really discriminatory .",
    "a possible pattern would amount to adding noise to model data , seeking the level at which an agreement with real data is approached .",
    "hopefully , at this level , it may still be possible to discriminate among different cosmologies .",
    "one of the results of this work concerns the reliability of comparisons between data and simulations based on dm  rather than gas  distributions .",
    "the quantitative outputs , quite independently from the cosmological model , are that : ( i ) dm  are systematically less correlated than gas ( dm slopes are more scattered than gas ) .",
    "( ii ) dm  are systematically greater than gas .",
    "both effects seem related to the increased complexity of the phase space distribution for a substance which is not constrained to be described by fluid variables .",
    "the first effect is however puzzling , in connection with the last point outlined in the previous subsection . as a matter of fact ,",
    "dm correlation is closer to real data than gas correlation . in fig .",
    "9 , for the sake of example , we compare the slope distributions for gas and dm .    in an attempt to find a reason for such finding , we note that , at present , galaxies may be expected to have a behaviour closer to dm particles rather than to gas . although most of the @xmath37ray emission is thought to come from baryons in the intracluster gas , elliptical galaxies could significantly contribute . as a matter of fact , at low redshifts , well resolved clusters show clearly a clumpy emission associated with galaxies .",
    "this should be taken into account , together with the fact that , in our sph simulations , particle masses still exceed the average galaxy size , while gas cooling is not included .",
    "these arguments , however , are only indicative . during their formation stages , galaxies can not be approximated by dm points and , to account for their present distribution , we should consider a late dm input arising from gas suppression , associated with cooling effects .",
    "in our opinion , at this stage , the main conclusion is that this point is among those to be explored through more resolved simulations , surely including gas cooling and possibly other physical effects .",
    "[ fig : angdmpbb ]    however , if cosmological models are compared with data on the basis of dm , the conclusions drawn on the basis of student t  test , f  test and ks  test , are reversed . for the sake of example , @xmath119@xmath120 , @xmath119@xmath121 and @xmath119@xmath122 , for the comparison rosat  cdm and for @xmath123mpc , pass from 0.21 to 0.68@xmath124 , 0.06 to 0.28 and 0.14 to 0.48@xmath125 , for @xmath114 ; from 0.37 to 0.05 , 0.11 to 0.97 and 0.18 to 0.22 , for @xmath126 .",
    "these shifts coherently indicate an increase in the amount of substructures for dm with respect to the gas .    altogether , dm ,",
    "unlike gas , scarcely feel dissipative processes ; hence , using dm , cdm and  models keep too many substructures and are no longer consistent with data ; on the contrary , the increase of substructures pushes   to agree with rosat sample outputs .",
    "the global morphology of galaxy clusters is well described by a multipole expansion of a pseudo  potential generating its surface brightness , around its centroid .",
    "such expansion leads to the power ratios , first introduced by bt95 , who also evaluated them for a rosat subsample . in this work",
    "we have performed an extensive comparison of such observational , with  worked out from model clusters .",
    "such clusters were obtained for three cosmological models , all normalized to present cluster number density .",
    "such models are cdm ( which , therefore , is not consistent with cobe quadrupole data ) ,    and   with 20@xmath127 of hdm given by a single neutrino flavour ( the latter two models are consistent with cobe quadrupole data ) .",
    "previous comparisons with simulated clusters were either restricted to 6 clusters , obtained with a treesph code by nfw , or used n  body non  hydro simulations . here , instead , we worked out 40 cluster models for each cosmological model using a treesph code .",
    "we checked whether our hydro simulations have a resolution adequate to yield safe  values for the aperture radii considered .",
    "we tested that for a few model clusters of the whole set , by changing softening and particle numbers .",
    "we found that  systematically show a greater dependence on the choice of the line of sight , by which a model cluster is assumed to be seen , than on variation of softening or particle numbers .",
    "the hydro code does not take into account gas cooling or supernova heating .",
    "this is expected to induce no bias , on the scales we considered , provided that most of the observed @xmath37ray flux originates from the intracluster gas .    among the results of our work",
    ", we wish to stress soon that  evaluated from gas distributions turn out to be substantially different from   worked out from dm distributions .",
    "this is to be ascribed to the smoothing effects of the interactions among gas particles , which erase anisotropies and structures .",
    "the effect is fairly significant and finally leads to a different score of cosmological models in respect to data .",
    "in fact , while dm  worked out for    model clusters are close to data , this is no longer true for gas within the same models . on the contrary , while dm  for cdm and   models show too much structure to fit data , gas  are in much better agreement with data , for these models .",
    "mohr ( 1995 ) reached similar conclusions .",
    "more precisely , they find that observed x  ray morphologies of clusters are inconsistent with those obtained from a set of simulated clusters for low ",
    "density cdm models .",
    "it is worth noticing that their simulations had been performed using a combined n  body / hydro code ( p3msph ) , while the bx set is purely gravitational .",
    "it should be stressed that bx , after comparing rosat data with n ",
    "body simulations , also outlined the need to extend the comparison to a large set of hydrodynamical simulations .    here",
    ", the comparison between data and simulation was performed through different steps .",
    "first of all , as bt96 , tb and bx , we used the student t  test , the f  test and the ks  test to compare  distributions .",
    "we also considered the cluster distribution in the 3dimensional parameter space with axes given by  ( @xmath59 ) , as well as projections of such distributions on planes .",
    "taking into account that data involve clusters at various redshifts , such distribution provides an average evolutionary track for clusters .",
    "however , comparing such distributions for data and models , we find a significantly stronger correlation of  in models than in data .",
    "the degree of correlation depends on the model , but seems however in disagreement with data .",
    "model clusters tend to indicate a significantly faster evolution than data .",
    "the cosmological model which seems closest to data is  and it is possible that different  mixtures can lead to further improvements .",
    "it is also possible that a slower evolution is an indication that the density of the universe is below critical .",
    "we therefore plan , in a near future , to perform cluster simulations for  models with lighter neutrinos and for 0cdm models .",
    "let us recall that , at present , the main evidences in favour of open models amount to the detections of large  scale matter concentrations at high redshift , either thanks to direct inspection ( bahcall @xmath0 fan 1998 ) , or through the statistics of arcs arising from lensing ( bartelmann et al .",
    "the latter analysis , in particular , seems to exclude a significant contribution of @xmath8 to the cosmic density , in agreement with the findings of this work .",
    "evidences in favour of @xmath17 , instead , are mostly related to recent improvements in the use of snia as standard candles .",
    "they seem to support @xmath128 models with a large @xmath1290.6 , see perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 and reiss et al . 1998 ) .",
    "both such evidences seem however to disagree with @xmath130 estimates based on x  ray cluster surveys , which may be consistent with @xmath128 , without vacuum contribution ( see sadat , blanchard & oukbir 1998 and references therein )    in this work , the low probability of   models is also confirmed by the analysis of  correlations , which may become a discriminatory tool to test models .",
    "we have seen that separate distributions of s can be in fair agreement with data , while their joint distribution is not .",
    "the disagreement found for such joint distributions also calls for an improvement of the observational data set . in our work",
    "we used the same observational set of previous analyses .",
    "we also tried to reproduce its possible biases by reproducing the redshift distribution of data clusters in models clusters .",
    "tb stressed that data selection is not based in cluster structure .",
    "however , we have performed a further check to improve the safety of the use of data .",
    "this amounted to test whether there is any correlation between cluster luminosity and multipole structure .",
    "to do so , we shared our model clusters in 2 or 4 subsamples , ordered according to their intrinsical luminosity , and verified that no correlation exists between  and luminosity . however , before reaching final conclusions on the cosmological model through global cluster features , an improvement of data is surely opportune .",
    "let us finally outline that the pseudo  potential , used to perform the multipole expansion , is somehow related to the potential yielding weak lensing ; however , while lensing effects are related to the total density @xmath131 , here we are referring to gas only , through its square density @xmath132 .",
    "the relation between @xmath131 and @xmath133 can be strongly model dependent , namely if the cosmic substance contains fair amounts of late",
    " derelativizing hdm , whose space and velocity distribution , in non  linear structures , might be substantially different from cdm itself .",
    "we therefore plan to do further work on model clusters to test relations between lensing effects and  expansion , also aiming to devise precise tests on dm composition .",
    "one of us ( sg ) wishes to thank sissa for its hospitality during the preparation of this work .",
    "one of us ( rv ) wants to thank y.p .",
    "jing for an early critical discussion on the aims of this work .",
    "ed bertschinger , who refereed this paper , is to be gratefully thanked for a number of important suggestions ."
