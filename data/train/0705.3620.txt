    "the motivation for this work stems from the problem of calculating the gravitational self - force ( sf ) acting on mass particles in orbit around black holes .",
    "this problem has drawn much attention recently , in relation with the effort to model the inspiral of compact objects into massive black holes in galactic nuclei ",
    "one of the prime targets for lisa , the planned space - based gravitational - wave detector .",
    "the scientific merit from detecting such inspirals is potentially high @xcite , but full exploitation of the gravitational - wave signal will require precise knowledge of the theoretical phase evolution of the waves , as predicted by general relativity , over a few years of inspiral .",
    "this , in turn , will require knowledge of the orbital evolution over a similar timescale , which , for sources of interest for lisa , would mean that the effects of the gravitational self force will have to be accounted for in the model .",
    "thanks to the small mass ratio characteristic of the relevant binary systems ( @xmath0@xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the mass of the compact object and @xmath3 is the mass of the massive black hole ) , the problem can be studied within the realm of perturbation theory , i.e. , by considering the small perturbation caused by the sf to the orbit of a test particle moving in the fixed geometry of the central black hole .",
    "there is now a well established theoretical framework for sf calculations in curved spacetimes @xcite , along with a practical calculation scheme for particle orbits around kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "this method , dubbed `` mode - sum scheme '' , requires as input the local metric perturbation ( or its multipole modes ) near the particle , in a particular gauge  the lorenz gauge . in the special case of a schwarzschild spacetime ( i.e. , a non - rotating central hole )",
    ", the lorenz - gauge metric perturbation can be obtained by solving the linearized einstein equations directly , for each tensor - harmonic mode of the perturbation ( using , e.g. , numerical evolution in the time domain , as in @xcite ) .",
    "this method was applied recently for circular orbits in schwarzschild , allowing a first calculation of the local gravitational sf for an orbiting particle @xcite .",
    "[ earlier calculations considered radial infall trajectories @xcite and static ( supported ) particles @xcite , neither scenarios likely to be of relevance to lisa . ]",
    "the work presented here is a first step towards tackling the problem in the kerr spacetime . to obtain the lorenz - gauge perturbation in kerr",
    ", one may follow one of two possible avenues of approach . in the first approach ,",
    "one first applies the teukolsky formalism to solve for the perturbation in the weyl scalars ( fully decoupled into fourier - harmonic modes if one opts to work in the frequency domain ) , and then reconstructs the corresponding metric perturbation in the lorenz gauge .",
    "a procedure for lorenz - gauge metric reconstruction is yet to be devised .",
    "the alternative approach , which we pursue here , is to solve directly for the metric perturbation , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , using time - domain numerical evolution of the lorenz - gauge perturbation equations .",
    "this method offers a few important advantages : first , the problem of reconstructing the metric perturbation is avoided .",
    "second , the behavior of the lorenz - gauge perturbation near the particle , unlike that of the weyl scalars , reflects the physical , isotropic form of the particle singularity , and is therefore more tractable .",
    "third , the time - domain treatment best exploits the hyperbolic nature of the lorenz - gauge perturbation equations . finally , the time - domain treatment makes it easier to tackle particle orbits of arbitrary eccentricity .    the main challenge in applying the above approach relates to the fact that the perturbation equations in kerr spacetime are not fully separable in the time domain .",
    "one can at most separate out the azimuthal dependence , then consider the evolution problem for each of the resulting ` @xmath4-modes ' , each of which being a field of 2 + 1 dimensions ( 2 + 1-d ) , depending on time and on 2 spatial coordinates .",
    "the non - separability of the field equations , on its own , does not pose a serious problem : evolution codes for vacuum perturbations in 2 + 1-d have been developed and used successfully since the mid-1990s @xcite .",
    "the difficulty , rather , arises from the inclusion of a point particle as a source for the perturbation .",
    "each @xmath4-mode of the resulting perturbation then diverges ( logarithmically ) at the particle , and accommodating this physical singularity on the discrete numerical grid becomes a major concern and the main challenge .",
    "our goal here is to develop a scheme for handling the particle singularity within a 2 + 1-d evolution code .",
    "the idea is simple , and can be described as follows . as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and unlike in @xcite ) , we model the orbiting particle with a spatial delta - function distribution .",
    "the asymptotic form of the local perturbation field near the particle is then known analytically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then construct a function ( given analytically ) which ( i ) has the same local asymptotic form and ( ii ) is easily decomposed into @xmath4-modes .",
    "the difference between the full perturbation and this `` singular '' function defines a new , `` regularized '' field .",
    "the singular function is so designed that each of the @xmath4-modes of the regularized field is continuous at the location of the particle .",
    "we then use the ( @xmath4-modes of the ) regularized field as our numerical evolution variables .",
    "the full solution is simply the sum of the numerically - calculated regular field , and the analytically - given singular function .",
    "( our `` regular '' function is , by construction , continuous , but not necessarily smooth ; the regular function to be constructed in this work will have discontinuous derivatives at the particle s location .",
    "it should be stressed , in this regard , that our `` regular '' and `` singular '' variables do _ not _ necessarily correspond to detweiler and whiting s ` r ' and ` s ' fields @xcite ,",
    "the latter so defined that the ` r ' field is a homogeneous , smooth solution of the perturbation equations . )    to make it easier to control the global properties of our numerical evolution variable ( especially its behavior at infinity and along the horizon ) , our evolution code will apply the above procedure only at the vicinity of the particle ; far away from the particle it will utilize as an integration variable the full , original homogeneous field . to make this work in practice , we will introduce a reference `` worldtube '' around the worldline ( in the 2 + 1-d space of the @xmath4-mode fields ) , whose `` width '' will be taken to be of order the background s radius of curvature , but will otherwise remain a control parameter in our numerical code .",
    "at each time step of the numerical evolution , the code will solve for the regular field inside the wordtube and for the original full field outside it , simply adjusting the value of the numerical variable across the boundary of the worldtube ( using the known difference between the full and regular fields , being just the value of the singular function ) .",
    "in validating the numerical code , it will be important to monitor the amount by which the numerical solutions depend on the worldtube dimensions , and verify that this dependence becomes negligible with increasing grid resolution .",
    "the idea of representing a singular part of the solution analytically and solving numerically for the remaining regular part is reminiscent of the `` puncture '' method , often used in numerical relativity in representing initial data for spacetimes containing black holes @xcite .",
    "we shall call our singular variable a `` puncture function '' , and refer to our scheme as the `` puncture method '' , but we remind that here the idea of a puncture is applied in a different physical context .    in this manuscript",
    "we demonstrate the applicability of the above method using a simple scalar - field toy model . to simplify the analysis still",
    ", we will consider circular orbits around a schwarzschild , rather than kerr , black hole .",
    "however , we will refrain from exploiting the spherical symmetry of the background geometry , pretending that the field equations can not be separated into spherical - harmonic modes , and working in 2 + 1-d",
    ". the code we develop here should be expandable in a rather direct way to the kerr spacetime and to eccentric / inclined orbits .",
    "we envisage applying a similar procedure for gravitational perturbations , but this would require much more development , including the formulation of the lorenz - gauge perturbation equations is a format suitable for numerical evolution in 2 + 1-d .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we decompose the scalar field in schwarzschild spacetime into @xmath4-modes , and analyze the behavior of the individual modes near the particle , showing the logarithmic divergence . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we formulate our puncture scheme , select a particular puncture function , and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the regular field near the particle . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] we describe our 2 + 1-d numerical evolution code as applied for vacuum perturbations .",
    "we test it for numerical convergence , and check that , for initial perturbations with compact support , the late - time decay rate of individual multipole modes agree with that predicted by theory .",
    "we also test the 2 + 1-d vacuum solutions against solutions obtained with a 1 + 1-d code . in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] we use the puncture scheme to incorporate a source term in our code , representing a scalar - charge particle moving in a circular geodesic orbit .",
    "we detail the numerical procedure in this case .",
    "[ sec : vi ] gives some results for the particle case , and presents a list of validation tests for the code .",
    "these include ( i ) test of point - wise numerical convergence , ( ii ) test of independence on the worldtube dimensions , and ( iii ) comparison with solutions obtained using a 1 + 1-d code . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vii ] we summarize this work , and discuss the application of our method for sf calculations .",

    "all modes compare to within less than 1% difference ( or far better ) , providing a strong validation test for the 2 + 1-d code.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "in this work we began developing the computational framework to facilitate evolution of black hole perturbations from point particles in 2 + 1-d .",
    "this is mainly motivated within the context of sf calculations in kerr : knowledge of the perturbation field near the particle is an essential input for any calculation of the local sf .",
    "the local field near a particle in kerr orbits has been studied so far mainly in a 1 + 1-d framework ( i.e. , through a spherical - harmonic decomposition ) , and so we started our analysis by exploring the field behavior in 2 + 1-d .",
    "specializing to a scalar field , we established that each azimuthal @xmath4-mode of the perturbation generically shows a logarithmic divergence near the particle .",
    "we then devised a numerical evolution scheme for the scalar field , based on approximating the divergent piece of the field analytically , and solving for the finite ( and continuous ) residual part .",
    "we demonstrated the applicability of this `` puncture '' scheme in the test case of circular orbits in schwarzschild ( but working in 2 + 1-d ) .",
    "for this , we developed a new 2 + 1-d evolution code , which we tested for numerical robustness and by demonstrating agreement with solutions obtained using other methods .",
    "we found that the scheme successfully resolves the residual , sub - dominant behavior of the scalar field near the particle .",
    "whether our code , in its current form ( and with realistic numerical resolution ) , allows sufficient accuracy for precise sf calculations remains to be explored , and we leave this for future work .",
    "the main strength of our time - domain approach is in the fact that it is now rather straightforward to extend the analysis to problems which are more astrophysically interesting .",
    "our scalar field code can be readily extended to deal with inclined and eccentric orbits , and generalization to kerr spacetime could be achieved rather straightforwardly based on the existing platform .",
    "we envisage applying the same numerical approach for solving the gravitational perturbation equations ( in the lorenz gauge ) , but we anticipate this would require much preparatory formulation work ( to cast the equations in a form suitable for 2 + 1-d evolution ) .    before attempting further extensions / applications of the code , one may consider a few possible improvements of the numerical method .",
    "firstly , working with a _ higher - order _ puncture scheme could prove very beneficial . in our leading - order scheme ,",
    "the regularized field @xmath355 is not differentiable at the location of the particle ( derivatives of @xmath355 diverge there logarithmically , in a direction - dependent manner ) , which complicates the analysis .",
    "this can be cured by including higher - order terms in the definition of the analytic puncture @xmath449 .",
    "a second - order puncture can readily be constructed based on eq .",
    "( [ 2ndorder ] ) above , which should yield a differentiable field @xmath355 ( with nearly no extra cost in computation time ) .",
    "this should have the following benefits : ( i ) the source term in the @xmath450-field equation would no longer have a strong , @xmath451 divergence near the particle  it would instead diverge logarithmically , which is much easier to accommodate numerically .",
    "( ii ) no logarithmic error terms of the sort discussed in sec .",
    "[ wlpts ] would occur , which should settle the quadratic convergence of the scheme near the particle .",
    "( iii ) sf calculations require the field s _ derivatives _ at the particle .",
    "the @xmath450-field calculated using our leading - order puncture would therefore require further regularization , whereas , at least in principle , the sf should be accessible directly from a differentiable @xmath450-filed coming from a second - order puncture scheme ( cf .",
    "discussion below ) .",
    "another possible improvement concerns the choice of initial data for the evolution . expediting",
    "the damping of the spurious initial waves would allow shorter runs and save in computational cost .",
    "an improved scheme could incorporate smooth approximate initial data .",
    "another idea , easier to implement , is to use interpolated solutions from low - resolution runs as initial conditions for high - resolution evolution .",
    "we are planning to incorporate the latter scheme in future applications of our code .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the application of our method to sf calculations .",
    "the standard `` mode - sum '' formula for the sf in kerr @xcite requires as input the individual @xmath321 multipole modes of the perturbation field . to apply the mode - sum formula in its standard form",
    ", we would therefore have to decompose our numerical @xmath4-mode solutions into their individual @xmath292-mode components .",
    "a more direct approach would be to access the sf directly from our regular @xmath4-mode fields @xmath355 .",
    "we are currently formulating such an `` @xmath4-mode sum '' scheme for the sf , and will present it elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the proposed scheme could use either the first - order puncture solutions @xmath355 calculated here ( which would then require us to apply a certain local - averaging procedure ) , or , in its simpler form , it could use the solutions of a future second - order puncture code .",
    "we thank carsten gundlach , ian hawke , norichika sago , jonathan thornburg , and james vickers for their helpful input .",
    "the basic idea for this project stemmed from discussions with richard price and napoleon hernandez , for which we are grateful to both .",
    "napoleon hernandez s master thesis ( university of texas at brownsville , unpublished ) explores the implementation of a similar idea .",
