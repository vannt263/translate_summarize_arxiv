    "contrary to widespread belief , there are not too many observed @xcite mesonic resonances to be accounted for by normal quark - antiquark states , which is the usually invoked argument to justify the introduction of exotic , i.e. , non-@xmath0 , configurations . the reasons why newly detected mesonic enhancements often seem to be incompatible with @xmath0 states can be manifold :    1",
    ".   the underlying confining potential may be different from what is generally taken for granted , as often demonstrated by us ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; 2 .",
    "mass shifts due to unitarisation ( or `` unquenching '' ) are mostly neglected or underestimated ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; 3 .",
    "unitarisation sometimes even yields extra , dynamically generated resonances , which nevertheless have a @xmath0 source ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; 4 .",
    "the opening of strong decay thresholds generally distorts the line shapes of nearby resonances , or can even by itself give rise to enhancements that look like resonances ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; 5 .",
    "large inelasticity effects between observed ozi - forbidden decays and non - observed ozi - allowed ones can lead to signal depletion at true resonances and/or thresholds , resulting in non - resonant apparent enhancements in between ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this talk",
    ", an short assessment will be made of the status of meson spectroscopy .",
    "as theoretical benchmark we shall take what many consider a kind of `` standard model '' of mesons , viz .  the celebrated and topcited relativised model of godfrey & isgur ( gi )",
    "@xcite , which features the ususal coulomb - plus - linear confinement forces , also called `` funnel '' potential , and an explicit one - gluon - exchange term generating spin - spin and spin - orbit splittings .",
    "after showing numerous discrepancies between the predictions of the gi model and data @xcite , we shall review an alternative description of three controversial mesonic systems , namely the @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite charmonium structures , as well as the @xmath6  @xcite charmed - strange meson .",
    "these states can not be described correctly by the gi or any other quenched @xmath0 model , giving rise to the usual `` poor - man s '' explanation in terms of exotics or crypro - exotics .",
    "below , we shall show how our unitarised resonance - spectrum expansion @xcite manages to explain @xmath1 @xcite as a non - resonant enhancement , and reproduce the true resonances @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite , together @xcite with the other axial - vector charmed mesons @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the gi @xcite quark model for mesons is still referred to very frequently for comparison when new resonances are observed or other models make predictions .",
    "this is understandable in view of the gi model s completeness in predicting meson spectra for almost any desired flavour combinations and quantum numbers , besides the employment of the widely accepted funnel potential .",
    "thus , it appears opportune to briefly reassess this 27-year - old model in the light of present - day meson spectra as interpreted by the pdg @xcite collaboration , identifying some of the outstanding problems .",

    "the light - meson spectrum @xcite appears to favour radial splittings that are considerably smaller than those predicted by the gi and similar funnel models , as well as lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "there is no indication that some of the observed resonances might be crypto - exotics , so that no excess of states can be claimed .",
    "on the other hand , missing states in e.g.  the strange and @xmath125 sectors make definite conclusions on the confining force even more difficult .",
    "especially the scalar @xmath126 but also the axial - vector @xmath127 come out too heavy in the gi model ( also see below ) . for the rest , too many quark - model states have not been observed so far , which hardly allows any feedback concerning the confining potential .      in recent years , the pdg listings have been invaded by a plague of charmonium - like , so - called `` @xmath128 '' states , several of which may not be resonances at all , but rather threshold @xcite or depletion @xcite effects ( see e.g.  @xmath129 @xcite below ) . moreover , genuine charmonium states like @xmath130 may be shifted considerably @xcite , turning a correct assignment into a much more difficult task than simply checking the mass predictions of one s favourite quenched quark model .",
    "as for the `` regular '' charmonium spectrum , too many spectroscopic states have evaded observation so far to allow a better understanding of confinement . on the other hand , clear indications of highly excited radial vector states",
    "@xcite have been systematically ignored by other model builders and the experimental groups themselves .      here",
    ", the scarcity of observed @xcite excited states strongly hampers any significant contribution to meson spectroscopy .      as for bottomonium ,",
    "a correct spectroscopic assignment of @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 @xcite is crucial to understand the interplay of confinement and coupled channels above the open - bottom threshold .",
    "the usual interpretation of these states as @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 , respectively , suffers from serious problems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "also , future experiments at lhc must certainly improve @xcite on the resolution achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite for any real advancement in spectroscopy .",
    "the @xmath129 vector charmonium enhancement @xcite , discovered @xcite in @xmath137 data , is puzzling because of its awkward mass and the non - observation of open - charm decay channels .",
    "this has led to various exotic or molecular model explanations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some references ) .",
    "however , the @xmath129 data also display a conspicuous dip precisely at the mass of the established @xmath138 , as well as the absence of peaks corresponding to other known @xmath139 states .",
    "these usually ignored yet very peculiar features can be understood by assuming @xcite a very broad , @xmath11-like , @xmath140 distribution centred around 4.26 gev , but depleted at the energies of @xmath139 resonances , including a new @xmath141 state at about 4.53  gev , as well as open - charm threshold openings ( see fig .",
    "[ octopsi ] ) .",
    "thus , dominant , ozi - allowed processes reveal    c    themselves as a kind of `` mirror images '' in the  ozi - suppressed  @xmath137 data . for further details , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath130 charmonium - like state was discovered @xcite as a @xmath137 enhancement in the decay @xmath142 , and later also observed in the hadronic channels @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the low mass of @xmath130 and its remarkable proximity to the @xmath147 threshold has given rise to many exotic or molecular interpretations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some references ) .",
    "however , we have shown @xcite that @xmath130 is perfectly compatible with a unitarised @xmath57  @xmath139 state , but strongly mass - shifted and with a large @xmath147 component in the wave function @xcite .",
    "figure  [ x3872 ] displays the    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     @xmath51  and @xmath37  components required to describe the data .",
    "see further ref .",
    "meson spectroscopy has progressed only marginally over the past decade when judged on the obtained feedback concerning the confinement and decay mechanisms in qcd , despite the observation of many new and exciting resonances .",
    "blame is to be put on both theorists and experimentalists , on the former ones because of their obsession with the funnel potential and exotics , and on the latter for failing to produce data with much higher resolution and carry out more systematic studies , especially partial - wave analyses @xcite , in various sectors of the meson spectrum . the clear evidence of large effects from unquenching , as e.g.  the mass shifts of @xmath126 @xcite and @xmath130 @xcite , the dynamically generated light scalar nonet @xcite , or more generally , due to threshold openings @xcite",
    ", should finally convince people that modern meson spectroscopy must go beyond the traditional quenched approaches like the gi @xcite model , no matter how pioneering the latter work was 27 years ago .",
