    "melting , or thermal denaturation of dna , is the process by which the two stands of the dna molecule become fully separated upon an increase of the temperature @xcite . at low temperatures the strands are partially unbound by forming fluctuating loops where the two strands are locally separated . as the melting temperature @xmath1",
    "is approached the average loops size increases , yielding full denaturation at @xmath1 .",
    "melting of dna has been extensively studied over the years both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the natural order - parameter of the denaturation transition is the fraction of bound base - pairs .",
    "this was measured using specific - heat and uv absorption experiments .",
    "simple models have yielded theoretical expressions for thermodynamic properties .",
    "two main approaches have been developed .",
    "one , known as the peyrard - bishop model , considers the two strands as directed polymers interacting via a short - ranged potential @xcite .",
    "one then focuses on the distance between complementary pairs as the melting transition is approached .",
    "the other , known as the poland - scheraga ( ps ) model , represents the dna molecule as an alternating sequence of bound segments and open loops , and focuses on the fraction of bound base - pairs @xcite . within the ps approach self - avoiding interactions , which are inherently long - range , may be taken into account . as have been shown these interactions affect the loop entropy , which controls the nature of the melting transition @xcite .    recently , single - molecule techniques such as optical tweezers @xcite , magnetic traps @xcite and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) @xcite have been used to probe properties of the melting process .",
    "other techniques , such as quenching , have also been applied @xcite .",
    "some of the experiments utilize an external force to induce unzipping of the two - strands and study their dynamics . in others ,",
    "the distance between two complementary base - pairs is probed by fcs without applying an external force .",
    "these experimental methods enable one to study not only bulk properties but rather microscopically fluctuating quantities .",
    "inspired by these experiments , theoretical treatments of dynamical properties of dna have been developed .",
    "several studies have focused on the dynamics of isolated loops away from the melting transition @xcite and at the transition @xcite .",
    "the survival probability of an isolated loop has been calculated .",
    "a toy model for the dynamics of interacting loops has also been introduced and analyzed @xcite .",
    "it has recently been shown that studying the loop dynamics may yield information on the loop entropy @xcite . within the ps approach the dependence of the entropy of a loop on its length plays a dominant role in determining the thermodynamic behavior near the transition .",
    "on general grounds one can argue that the entropy of a loop of length @xmath2 takes the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of loop configurations . here",
    "@xmath5 is a model - dependent constant and @xmath0 is a universal exponent .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath0 has been debated over the years .",
    "it was found to be modified when the excluded - volume interactions , which are long ranged in nature , are taken into account @xcite .",
    "when interactions between loops are neglected , and excluded volume interactions are taken into account only within each loop an exponent @xmath6 was found @xcite . on the other hand , when excluded volume interactions both within a loop and between the loop and the rest of the chain are taken into account , the entropy exponent was found to increase to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this latter result , which predicts a first order denaturation transition for homopolymers , has been verified numerically @xcite .",
    "while numerical studies of the homopolymer model with excluded volume interactions yield a clear first order transition @xcite , a direct experimental measurement of @xmath0 is rather difficult and has not been carried out so far . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that at the melting transition the time dependence of the base - pair autocorrelation function depends on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the base - pair autocorrelation function is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a variable which indicates if base pair @xmath10 is open @xmath11 or closed @xmath12 at time @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denotes an average over @xmath15 .",
    "the behavior of the autocorrelation function was studied theoretically away from the melting transition @xcite and may , in principle , be obtained experimentally by fcs studies . in these experiments",
    "the states of a specific base - pair is monitored .",
    "so far , fcs experiments have been restricted to short molecules @xcite . measuring the exponent @xmath0",
    "requires extending these studies to longer molecules .    in the present paper we elaborate on and",
    "extend the analysis presented in @xcite for the dynamical behavior of homopolymers at the melting transition .",
    "the dynamics of a single loop is studied using a simple model , whose validity is then verified in detail using numerical simulations . within this model the entropy exponent @xmath0 is introduced as a free parameter which may be chosen at will . while the studies in @xcite were tested numerically only for the case @xmath16 , here we test the robustness of the results for models with arbitrary values of @xmath0 .",
    "we then consider a toy model , similar to the one considered in @xcite , which indicated that the results still hold when the interaction between loops is taken into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we study the single loop model using both the scaling argument and microscopic models . in sec .",
    "3 results for the many loops model are presented .",
    "finally , we end with a brief summary .",
    "we start by considering the dynamics of an isolated loop . in this approach one ignores processes like merging of loops and the splitting of a large loop into two or more smaller ones .",
    "this may be justified by the fact that the cooperativity parameter , which controls the statistical weight of opening a new loop , is estimated to be rather small , @xmath17 @xcite . thus splitting a loop into two is unfavorable . also , the average distance between loops , which within the ps model is proportional to @xmath18 , is large , making the independent loop approximation plausible . in sec .",
    "[ secmanyloop ] we introduce a simple model to effectively take into account the interactions between loops and show that these interactions do not modify the results obtained within the single loop approach .    within the single loop dynamics ,",
    "we assume that a loop may change its length by closing or opening of base pairs at its two ends .",
    "it survives as long as its two ends do not meet .",
    "let @xmath19 be the survival probability of a loop of initial length @xmath20 at time @xmath13 . as discussed above , the quantity of interest is the equilibrium autocorrelation function @xmath21 where for simplicity of notation we have dropped the site index @xmath10 . here @xmath22 is the probability of having a loop of length @xmath20 in equilibrium .",
    "hence , @xmath23 is the probability of a particular site to belong to a loop of length @xmath20 .",
    "note that we assume that site @xmath10 remains open as long as the loop survives .",
    "this approximation does not affect the behavior of the autocorrelation function in the scaling limit .",
    "we proceed by first presenting a scaling analysis demonstrating that in the case of a homopolymer and at criticality , the autocorrelation function decays at large @xmath13 as @xmath24 for @xmath25 , while it remains finite , @xmath26 , for @xmath27 .",
    "these results are then tested and verified using numerical simulations for various values of @xmath0 .      in the case of a homopolymer and at criticality",
    "it has been shown that the equilibrium loop size distribution is @xmath28 . to estimate the survival probability of a loop of length @xmath20",
    ", we consider dynamics under which the loops are non - interacting and do not split into a number of smaller loops .",
    "similar to @xcite we further assume that the loop is in a local thermal equilibrium at any given time during its evolution .",
    "the validity of this assumption will be discussed in detail below .",
    "the loop free energy is thus given by @xmath29 .",
    "within the framework of the fokker - planck equation , the probability distribution of finding a loop of size @xmath2 at time @xmath13 , @xmath30 , is given by @xmath31p(n , t ) \\ ; ,          \\label{eqn : fpe}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the diffusion constant .",
    "here we have taken the continuum limit and assumed the dynamics to be over - damped .",
    "this equation has to be solved with the boundary condition @xmath33 and initial condition @xmath34 .",
    "the survival probability of the loop is then given by @xmath35 .",
    "within the scaling approach the survival probability is written in the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 . in appendix 1",
    "we show that the asymptotic behavior of the scaling function for small and large values of the argument is @xmath38 the autocorrelation function ( eq .",
    "( [ eqn : corr ] ) ) may thus be written as @xmath39 where the system size @xmath40 is taken to infinity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we first consider the long time behavior for @xmath41 . in this case",
    "the integrals are controlled by the upper limit @xmath40 , where @xmath42 .",
    "both numerator and denominator diverge as @xmath43 so that @xmath44 for @xmath45 . on the other hand for @xmath25",
    "both integrals are independent of the upper limit .",
    "changing variables to @xmath46 yields @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the average loop size .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 at small @xmath50 ( eq . ( [ eq : asympsurvivh ] ) ) implies that the integral converges for @xmath51 , yielding @xmath24 .",
    "hence @xmath52 this expression suggests that measuring @xmath53 at criticality may be used to determine the entropy exponent @xmath0 .",
    "in particular it can be used to distinguish between the case of a continuous transition ( @xmath54 ) , where @xmath26 , and a first order phase transition ( @xmath25 ) , where @xmath53 decays to zero at long times .    in the above analysis",
    "it is assumed that the loop is at local equilibrium at any given time . for this assumption to be valid , the survival time of large loops has to be much longer than its equilibration time .",
    "a typical survival time of a loop of length @xmath2 scales as @xmath55 . on the other hand , simple models for the dynamics of microscopic loop configurations , which are usually based on diffusion processes , yield relaxation times which also scale as @xmath55 .",
    "thus the two typical times scale in the same way with the loop size , and it is not a priori clear that during the evolution of the loop it is at local equilibrium . note that off criticality the loop size changes linearly in time and therefore the assumption of local equilibrium is clearly not valid .    in",
    "the following we introduce and study a model for the loop dynamics .",
    "this is done in two steps : first , we consider the simpler case of @xmath16 discussed in @xcite .",
    "we then generalize this approach to arbitrary values of @xmath0 .",
    "we find strong evidence that the local equilibrium assumption holds asymptotically for the model .",
    "it is thus argued that within the model the local equilibrium assumption is valid .      in this section",
    "we introduce and analyze a simple model of loop dynamics corresponding to @xmath16 . within the model ,",
    "the loop is described by a fluctuating interface ( or a string ) , interacting with an attractive substrate in @xmath56 dimensions . here",
    "the interface height variable corresponds to the distance between complementary bases .",
    "the interface configurations are those of a restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) model defined as follows ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : model ] ) ) : let @xmath57 be the height of the interface at site @xmath10 .",
    "the heights satisfy @xmath58 .",
    "consider a loop between sites @xmath59 and @xmath2 ( where @xmath2 is even ) as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : model ] ) . outside the loop",
    "the interface is bound to the substrate so that @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 . inside the loop the heights @xmath63 can take any non - negative value which is consistent with the rsos conditions . for simplicity",
    "we allow only one end of the loop to fluctuate while the other is held fixed .",
    "this should not modify any of our results , since the dynamics of the two ends of long loops are uncorrelated with each other .",
    "we consider a random sequential dynamics in which the loop configuration and its length are free to fluctuate .",
    "thus the dynamical moves are as follows : @xmath64 as long as the resulting heights are non - negative and the rsos condition is satisfied . for @xmath65 the loop length",
    "is changed according to the rules @xmath66 where @xmath2 can decrease only if @xmath67 . at the other",
    "end the height is fixed , @xmath68 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the number of configurations of a loop of size @xmath2 is given by @xmath69 with @xmath16 for large @xmath2 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the number of walks of length @xmath2 in @xmath56 dimensions is @xmath70 and the probability of first return is @xmath71 . the ratio , @xmath72 , between the two length changing processes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : endrate ] ) is chosen such that in the large @xmath2 limit the loop is not biased to either grow or shrink .",
    "this corresponds to the model being at the denaturation transition point , which is determined by equating the free energies of the pinned segment and that of the open loop . combining this with detailed balance yields the ratio between the rates .",
    "the parameter @xmath73 determines the rate of the length changing processes : @xmath74 corresponds to the dynamics of a loop of a fixed length . as @xmath73",
    "is increased the length changing processes become faster . in the following subsection",
    "this model is generalized to include a power law potential between the interface and the substrate .",
    "this will allow us to study other values of @xmath0 .    in a realization of this dynamics one of the @xmath75 attempts defined above , eqs .",

    "one attempted move of the edge defines a monte carlo sweep .        in order to test the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fpe ] ) we compare its predictions with results obtained from numerical simulations of the model above . in the numerical simulation",
