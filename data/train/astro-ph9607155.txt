    "an advantage of being one of the last speakers is that my preceding colleagues have given you an excellent introduction .",
    "so , i need only remind you of a few key points .",
    "the most important feature to remember from wei zheng s description of hut is its sensitivity below 1200  .",
    "this allows us to see the lyman limit region in low redshift agn .",
    "a glimpse of the far - ultraviolet properties of these bright , nearby agn is important because our whole concept of a unified model is based on low - redshift objects .",
    "nearby agn are bright , allowing spectropolarimetry and high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy , and the good angular scale allows us to resolve the narrow - line region ( nlr ) with hst and from the ground .",
    "unified models of agn use a combination of obscuration , reflection , and orientation to explain the different appearances of seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies ( see the review by antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "this picture implies some anisotropy for the escaping ionizing radiation . as andrew wilson showed you yesterday , this has important consequences for the morphology of the nlr .",
    "if nlr gas is spherically distributed about the nuclear region , the escaping radiation will produce biconical structures projected onto the sky in obscured agn ( type 2 ) and more compact , more symmetric structures in those viewed pole on ( type 1 s ) . by and large , this is what is observed ( e.g. , pogge 1989 ; evans et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in more general terms",
    ", one could classify the means of collimating the ionizing radiation in one of two categories : intrinsic anisotropy , or geometrical shadowing .",
    "examples of intrinsically anisotropic radiation would be that due to relativistic beaming or the radiation from an accretion funnel in a geometrically thick accretion disk .",
    "geometrical shadows that collimate the radiation can be produced not only by the obscuring torus , but also by the wind from an accretion disk or by a toroidal configuration of broad - line region clouds .",
    "_ all examples of shadowing predict we should see optically thick neutral hydrogen absorption at the lyman limit . _",
    "of 13 agn with @xmath0 observed with hut , only 4 show intrinsic lyman limits .",
    "table 1 summarizes the hut astro-1 and astro-2 observations , and figure 1 shows representative spectra .",
    "all objects with lyman limit absorption ( ngc  1068 , ngc  4151 , ngc  3516 , and ngc  3227 ) have narrow - line regions with bipolar morphologies . the remaining 9 agn are seyfert 1 s or low - redshift quasars with point - like nlr s as imaged with hst or from the ground . _",
    "seeing absorption only in objects with bipolar nlr s favors shadowing for collimation over an intrinsically beamed mechanism . _",
    "l c c c c ngc 1068 & 2 & 0.0038 & bi - cone & yes ngc 4151 & 1 & 0.0033 & bi - cone & yes ngc 3227 & 1 & 0.0039 & bi - cone & yes ( 95% confidence ) ngc 3516 & 1 & 0.0088 & s - shape & yes ngc 5548 & 1 & 0.017 & point - like & no mrk 335 & 1 & 0.026 & point - like & no mrk 279 & 1 & 0.031 & point - like & no mrk 509 & 1 & 0.035 & point - like & no mrk 478 & 1 & 0.077 & point - like & no pg1211 + 143 & 1 & 0.081 & ? & no pg1351 + 640 & 1 & 0.088 & ? & no 3c 273 & 1 & 0.158 & jet & no e1821 + 64 & 1 & 0.297 & point - like & no",
    "the next question is , if obscuration collimates the light , can we pinpoint the location of the absorbing gas ?",
    "monitoring variability in absorption features allows one to measure two timescales  the ionization timescale and the recombination timescale  each of which allows some measure of the distance of the absorbing gas from the central source . to apply this technique , we observed ngc  4151 with hut 6 times at intervals of 23 days during the astro-2 mission , and we got lucky . our data ( fig .",
    "2 ) show an approximate @xmath1-function blip in the continuum flux and the change of the neutral hydrogen column in response .",
    "when the continuum flux rises ( a 60% increase , or @xmath2 ) , we see a nearly instantaneous drop in the neutral hydrogen column ( @xmath3 ) giving an ionization timescale of @xmath4 days , the limit of our sampling .",
    "after the continuum returns to its mean intensity , the neutral hydrogen column gradually increases with an e - folding timescale of @xmath5 days .",
    "the decrease in the neutral hydrogen column , @xmath6 , and the time , @xmath7 , required to respond to the continuum increase , @xmath8 , provide a direct measure of the number of ionizing photons and indirectly give a measure of the distance of the absorber from the source . since @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ,",
    "the distance of the absorber from the source can be found as @xmath11^{1/2}$ ] . for our observations of ngc  4151 , an upper limit of 2 days on",
    "the ionization timescale translates into an upper limit of 30 pc on the radius of the absorbing gas .",
    "the recombination timescale , @xmath12 , is often cited as a measure of the density of absorbing material , but this is true only if one knows the ionization state of the gas ( krolik & kriss 1995 ) .",
    "the neutral fraction @xmath13 depends on the ionization parameter @xmath14 as @xmath15 , where q is typically @xmath16 , determined by atomic data and the shape of the ionizing spectrum .",
    "these relations can be used to obtain a distance estimate for the gas based on the observed recombination time : @xmath17 for our observations of ngc  4151 , the absorbing gas is located far from the central source in the nlr .",
    "the absorbing gas may be outflowing material driven off the surface of the obscuring torus .",
    "given the limited sampling and the simplified treatment shown here , i would view these numbers as only order of magnitude estimates .",
    "they show , however , that the the absorbing gas is likely to be far from the central source , at or beyond the location of the obscuring torus .",
    "our observations illustrate the power of monitoring absorption variability , and this technique offers real possibilities for learning more about both uv and x - ray absorbing gas ."
