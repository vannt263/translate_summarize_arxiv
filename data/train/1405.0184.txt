    "emission lines of si ii have been observed at optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths in a variety of plasmas , such as planetary nebulae , quasars and the interstellar medium ",
    "see for example : @xcite .",
    "particularly useful for diagnostic purposes are the multiplets 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath5 ",
    "3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p and 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath5 ",
    "3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0d at around 2340 and 1810 @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "similarly , @xcite have detected two emission lines ( @xmath8 7849 @xmath7 ) in the magnetic bp star a centauri ( hd 125823 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have determined the silicon abundance in the solar atmosphere , based on lines of si ions , including those of si ii",
    ". many lines of si ii in the 750 - 6680 @xmath9 wavelength range are listed in the chianti database at http://www.chiantidatabase.org/ and the _ atomic line list _ ( v2.04 ) of peter van hoof at @xmath10 .",
    "silicon ions , including si ii , are also important for the studies of fusion plasmas , particularly because amorphous silicon is used for coating the first wall of the devices , such as textor .",
    "@xcite have measured intensities of several si ii lines in the textor tokamak in the 290 - 640 @xmath9 wavelength range , belonging to the @xmath11 5 levels .",
    "the importance of data for si ions has further increased with the developing iter project .    for plasma diagnostics and modelling ,",
    "atomic data are required for a range of parameters , particularly energy levels , radiative rates ( a- values ) , and excitation rates ( or equivalently the effective collision strengths @xmath12 ) . measured values of energy levels",
    "have been compiled by the nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) team @xcite and are available at their website http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm .",
    "theoretical energy levels have been determined by several authors , and the most notable results are those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both these workers have also listed the a- values .",
    "results for collision strengths ( @xmath13 ) and effective collision strengths ( @xmath12 ) are also available .",
    "@xcite have reported @xmath12 data for transitions among the lowest 7 levels of the 3s@xmath03p and 3s3p@xmath0 configurations and from the 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath14 ground state levels to higher excited ones , up to 15 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these limited results are based on the @xmath4-matrix method and are primarily in @xmath15 coupling ( russell - saunders or spin - orbit coupling ) , but corresponding data for fine - structure transitions were determined through algebraic transformation . although calculations for @xmath13 were performed up to an energy of 10 ryd , which is fully sufficient to determine @xmath12 up to t@xmath16 = 10@xmath17 k , the range of partial waves adopted by them ( @xmath18 6 ) was too limited to obtain convergence of @xmath13 , not only for the allowed but also the forbidden transitions .",
    "furthermore , @xcite analysed several observations using their data and noted discrepancies with theory by up to a factor of two for several lines . on the other hand , @xcite studied broad emission lines of high luminosity qsos , including some of si ii , particularly @xmath19 1263 @xmath7 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath5  3s@xmath03d @xmath0d ) , 1307 @xmath7 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath5  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0s ) and 1814 @xmath7 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath5  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0d ) . for the 1814 @xmath7 line",
    "there was a satisfactory agreement between prediction and observation , but the discrepancies for the other two lines were over an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , there was a clear need to re - examine the theoretical atomic data .",
    "subsequently , @xcite made significant improvements over the atomic data of @xcite , mainly by extending the range of partial waves up to angular momentum @xmath20 = 36 . furthermore , he performed calculations in the breit - pauli b - spline @xmath4-matrix ( bsrm ) approach and reported @xmath12 not only over a wider temperature range ( up to log t@xmath16 = 5.4 k ) but also for _ all _ transitions among 31 levels of the 3s@xmath03p ,",
    "3s3p@xmath0 , 3s3p3d , 3s@xmath04@xmath2 , 3s@xmath05s / p / d / f and 3s@xmath06s / p configurations . as a result of these improvements the differences between his values of @xmath12 and those of @xcite were significant for some transitions , in both magnitude and behaviour , particularly the allowed ones , such as 112 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath21 ",
    "3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath22 ) and 2 13 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ",
    "3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath24 ) , as shown in his fig .",
    "however , tayal included only 2 levels ( @xmath0d@xmath25 ) of the 3s3p3d configuration , whereas it generates 23 in total ( see table 1 ) , and some of these lie in between those of the 3s@xmath04@xmath2 and 3s@xmath05@xmath2 configurations , included in his calculations .",
    "the omission of these levels affects the resonance structure of @xmath13 and subsequently calculations of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , there is a scope for improvement as well as confirmation of accuracy of the tayal results , so that data can be confidently applied to plasma studies .",
    "@xcite performed another calculation adopting the breit - pauli @xmath4-matrix code of @xcite . although a large number of ( 43 ) @xmath15 terms were included in the collisional calculations , they reported values of @xmath12 only at three temperatures _ and _ for 8 transitions from the ground level .",
    "more importantly , discrepancies with the corresponding results of @xcite as well as @xcite are up to 50% for several transitions . in general , there is poor agreement among the three @xmath4-matrix calculations .",
    "@xcite speculated that differences with the calculations of @xcite could be because of the non - orthogonal orbitals adopted by him .",
    "however , @xcite adopted orthogonal orbitals , as did @xcite , but differences between the two sets of @xmath12 are still up to 50% at all temperatures between 5000 and 20,000 k. a closer examination of the collision strengths shown by @xcite and @xcite for three transitions , namely 12 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath21  3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ) , 24 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ",
    "3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p@xmath26 ) and 27 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ",
    "3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0d@xmath24 ) , reveals that background values of @xmath27 are _ lower _ in the latter s calculations , particularly at energies below 0.8 ryd ( equivalent to @xmath8 1.25@xmath2810@xmath29 k ) .",
    "these differences clearly lead to the lowest values of @xmath12 reported by @xcite for all transitions and at all temperatures .",
    "@xcite included a larger range of partial waves ( @xmath30 16 ) in comparison to those of @xcite , who included only @xmath30 8 , and yet their values of @xmath12 are the _ lowest _ , not only for the allowed ( such as 1 3 , 4 and 6 ) but also the forbidden ( 12 and 15 ) transitions . therefore , neither the range of partial waves nor the use of ( non ) orthogonal orbitals appears to be a convincing cause of the discrepancies in @xmath12 . for this reason we have performed another calculation for the important si ii ion and report a complete set of results for energy levels , a- values and @xmath12 for all transitions among 56 levels of the 3s@xmath03p , 3s3p@xmath0 , 3p@xmath1 , 3s@xmath03d , 3s3p3d , 3s@xmath04@xmath2 and 3s@xmath05@xmath2 configurations .",
    "to calculate energy levels and a- values we have employed the multi - configuration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) code , developed by @xcite .",
    "it is a fully relativistic code , based on the @xmath31 coupling scheme , and includes higher - order relativistic corrections arising from the breit ( magnetic ) interaction and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) effects ( vacuum polarisation and lamb shift ) .",
    "this code has undergone several revisions by the names grasp ( general - purpose relativistic atomic structure package ) , grasp92 and grasp2k , revised by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , the version adopted here has been revised by one of its authors ( dr .",
    "p. h. norrington ) , is known as grasp0 and is freely available at the website http://web.am.qub.ac.uk / darc/. this provides comparable results with other revised versions and has been extensively applied by ourselves and other workers to a wide range of ions .",
    "furthermore , as in our earlier work , the option of _ extended average level _ ( eal ) has been adopted in which a weighted ( proportional to 2@xmath32 + 1 ) trace of the hamiltonian matrix is minimised .",
    "we note that results obtained for energy levels and a- values are comparable to other options , such as _ average level _",
    "( al ) , as demonstrated by @xcite for kr ions .    for the determination of atomic structure we have included 14 configurations , namely ( 1s@xmath02s@xmath02p@xmath33 ) 3s@xmath03p , 3s3p@xmath0 , 3p@xmath1 , 3s@xmath03d , 3s3p3d , 3s@xmath04@xmath2 and 3s@xmath05@xmath2 , which generate 56 levels listed in table 1 .",
    "our calculated level energies , obtained with the inclusion of breit and qed effects , are given in table 1 along with the nist compilations of experimental energies and those of @xcite who adopted the multi - configuration hartree - fock ( mchf ) code of @xcite .",
    "since si ii is only moderately heavy , the contributions of breit and qed effects are negligible .",
    "however , differences with the nist listings are up to @xmath8 0.1 ryd for some of the levels , particularly 3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0p@xmath34 ( 14 and 15 ) .",
    "additionally , the orderings are also slightly different in a few instances  see for example levels 1722 .",
    "we note here that for some species , such as al - like ti x @xcite , it is not possible to unambiguously identify the levels , because of strong mixing . however , that is not the case for si ii .",
    "the energies obtained by @xcite are in closer agreement with those of nist for all levels , because he has used non - orthogonal orbitals . however , his energy level ordering differs with that of nist in a few instances , such as for 67 and 2122 . furthermore , using the similar non - orthogonal orbitals , in his earlier calculations @xcite the energy obtained for the 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 level is lower by 13% .",
    "nevertheless , a clear advantage of this approach is that orbitals can be independently optimised on individual states / levels and thus a higher accuracy can be achieved by minimising the differences with the measured results .",
    "however , this approach can only be successfully applied if experimental energies are already available , which is the case for si ii , but not for all levels , because several are missing from the nist compilations as seen in table 1 .",
    "since @xcite performed collisional calculations among experimentally - determined levels only , he could apply the approach of non - orthogonal orbitals .",
    "nevertheless , most of the scattering codes , including the one adopted here and discussed in section 5 , do not have a provision of this option .",
    "a most commonly and widely used methodology for an accurate determination of energy levels ( and hence subsequent other parameters ) is the inclusion of _ configuration interaction _ ( ci ) .",
    "this approach has been extensively applied to a wide range of ions by many workers , including ourselves for other si ions @xcite . therefore , to assess the effect of additional ci we have performed further calculations with the _ flexible atomic code _",
    "( fac ) of @xcite .",
    "this code , apart from being highly efficient , provides results for energy levels and a- values of comparable accuracy with other atomic structure codes , such as civ3 ( configuration interaction version 3 ) of @xcite and grasp , as shown by @xcite for three mg - like ions .",
    "we have performed three calculations with the fac code with increasing amount of ci , namely ( i ) fac1 , which includes the same configurations / levels as in grasp ; ( ii ) fac2 ; which includes all possible combinations of the 3@xmath2 orbitals ( 3 * 3 ) plus 3s@xmath04@xmath2 and 3s@xmath05@xmath2 , generating 164 levels in total ; and finally ( iii ) fac3 , which includes a further 11 levels of 3s@xmath06@xmath2 , because some of these intermix with those of fac2 .",
    "energies obtained from these three calculations are listed in table 1 for comparison with other results .",
    "our fac1 energies agree closely with those from grasp ( within 0.03 ryd ) and the ordering is also similar , although a few differ slightly , such as levels 1722 .",
    "we also note that small discrepancies in the grasp and fac energies mainly arise due to the different ways the calculations of central potential for radial orbitals and recoupling schemes of angular parts are performed  see the detailed discussion in the fac manual ( ) . such small differences have also been noted for several other ions .",
    "inclusion of larger ci in fac2 lowers the energies , by up to 0.07 ryd , for some of the levels , such as 1215 , but differences with the nist compilations remain of up to @xmath8 0.1 ryd .",
    "finally , energies obtained in fac3 are comparable ( within 0.01 ryd ) to those from fac2 indicating that the inclusion of the 3s@xmath06@xmath2 configuration has little effect on the energy levels of table 1 .",
    "furthermore , the energy for level 2 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ) has become worse than in fac1 or grasp , and hence there in no overall advantage of including more ci than that already considered in grasp .",
    "we discuss this further below .",
    "@xcite have performed a series of calculations with the atomic structure ( as ) code of @xcite .",
    "apart from adopting different optimisation procedures ( including the minimisation with observed energies ) they have included _ extensive _ ci with up to @xmath35 = 5 orbitals in 44 configurations .",
    "they have also opened the @xmath35 = 2 shell ( frozen in our work with grasp and fac ) to account for the core - valence correlation . however , none of their nine calculations yielded accurate energies for the lowest 15 levels .",
    "differences with the measurements for all sets of energies are over 15% for some levels or others , as shown in their table 2 .",
    "it is clear that inclusion of a large amount of ci is not helpful for the accurate determination of si ii energy levels .",
    "apart from the inclusion of ci , another possibility of improving the accuracy of wave functions is to add correlation effects through pseudo orbitals , i.e. all orbitals need not be spectroscopic as has been the case in the calculations described above with the grasp , fac and as codes .",
    "this is a normal practice in standard @xmath4-matrix calculations for @xmath13 , for which input wave functions are generated through the civ3 code , but all orbitals are orthogonal .",
    "therefore , @xcite adopted this approach but their energy levels still differ by up to 6% with the measurements .",
    "additionally , a disadvantage of this approach is the presence of unphysical pseudo resonances , because the corresponding eigenstates are not included in the calculations of @xmath13  see for example , fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "if these pseudo resonances are not properly removed then the subsequent results for @xmath12 may be significantly overestimated  for examples see figs . 1  6 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , scope remains for improvement over our energy levels listed in table 1 , but keeping in mind our further calculations for more important parameters ( @xmath13 and @xmath12 ) , the accuracy achieved should be satisfactory for a majority of the levels .",
    "using the grasp code we have calculated a- values for four types of transitions , namely electric dipole ( e1 ) , electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , magnetic dipole ( m1 ) and magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) . in general , e1 transitions dominate in magnitude , but sometimes other types of transitions are also important and hence are ( preferably ) required for a complete plasma model . the absorption oscillator strength ( @xmath36 ) and radiative rate a@xmath37 ( in s@xmath38 ) for any type of transition @xmath39",
    "are related by the following expression :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the electron mass and charge , respectively , @xmath43 velocity of light , @xmath44 the transition energy / wavelength in @xmath7 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 the statistical weights of the lower ( @xmath47 ) and upper ( @xmath32 ) levels , respectively . however , the relationships between oscillator strength f@xmath48 ( dimensionless ) and the line strength s ( in atomic unit , 1 a.u .",
    "= 6.460@xmath2810@xmath49 cm@xmath0 esu@xmath0 ) with the a- values are different for different types of transitions ",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite .",
    "in table 2 we list transition ( energies ) wavelengths ( @xmath51 , in @xmath7 ) , radiative rates ( a@xmath37 , in s@xmath38 ) , oscillator strengths ( f@xmath48 , dimensionless ) , and line strengths ( s , in a.u . ) for all 460 electric dipole ( e1 ) transitions among the 56 levels of si ii .",
    "the a- , f- and s- values have been calculated in both babushkin and coulomb gauges , i.e. the length and velocity forms in the widely used non - relativistic nomenclature . however , in table 2 results are listed in the length form alone , because the velocity form is generally considered to be comparatively less accurate",
    ". nevertheless , we will discuss later the velocity / length form ratio , as this provides some assessment of the accuracy of the results .",
    "also note that the _ indices _ used to represent the lower and upper levels of a transition correspond to those in table 1 .",
    "apart from the above e1 transitions , there are 733 electric quadrupole ( e2 ) , 567 magnetic dipole ( m1 ) , and 574 magnetic quadrupole ( m2 ) transitions among the same 56 levels .",
    "however , for these only the a - values are listed in table 2 , because these are the ones required for plasma modelling .",
    "the corresponding results for f- values can be easily obtained through eq .",
    "( 1 ) . similarly ,",
    "if required , corresponding s- values can be obtained through eqs .",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite .",
    "in table 3 we compare our f- values from grasp with those of @xcite and @xcite for transitions among the lowest 30 levels of table 1 .",
    "@xcite have listed several sets of f- values , but those included in table 3 correspond to their ` recommended ' results , which are based on the averages of a variety of theoretical and experimental ( to be discussed later ) values .",
    "these authors reported f- values only for transitions among the lowest 15 levels , but many are missing from the work of @xcite .",
    "most of the missing transitions are _ weak _",
    "( i.e. f @xmath8 10@xmath52 or even less ) , but some are rather strong , such as 622 ( f = 0.125 ) , 721 ( f = 0.120 ) and 1222 ( f = 0.734 ) .",
    "this is because he included the 3s@xmath04f ( 2122 ) levels in his calculations for collisional data @xcite , but not for the radiative rates .",
    "nevertheless , the absence of f- ( or a- ) values for these transitions may affect the modelling of plasmas .    among the _ common _ transitions ,",
    "f- values differ by up to a factor of two for a few , such as 2  20 , 8  10/11 and 2  24 .",
    "these transitions are comparatively strong ( 0.15 @xmath53 f @xmath53 0.89 ) and therefore better agreement is expected . however",
    ", such discrepancies do arise with varying amounts of ci ( and methods / codes ) as discussed in detail by @xcite  see their figs . 2 and 3 , and particularly table 3 .",
    "similarly , discrepancies for some weak transitions ( such as 1 4 , 2  4/7 and 4  11 ) are up to an order of magnitude .",
    "weaker transitions are more susceptible to varying amount of ci , due to cancellation or additive effects , and hence such discrepancies are very common  see also @xcite .",
    "overall , there is a good agreement among all calculations for most transitions .",
    "for a few transitions , measured f- values are also available ",
    "see @xcite and references therein , but there is significant scatter among these .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of the radiative data can not be assessed by comparison with experimental results . however , another criterion normally used to assess the accuracy of f- or a- values is to compare the ratio ( r ) of their velocity and length forms .",
    "this should ideally be close to unity but often is not @xcite , because the two formulations are not exactly the same .",
    "similarly , different calculations with differing amount of ci may yield r closer to unity but strikingly different f- values in magnitude , as already stated .",
    "nevertheless , we include in table 3 the ratio of the velocity and length forms obtained in our calculations with grasp .    for most ( comparatively strong ) transitions listed in table 3",
    "the ratio r is within @xmath8 20% of 1.0 .",
    "however , there are exceptions .",
    "for example , for the 1 8 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath21  3s@xmath04s @xmath0s@xmath26 ) and 2  8 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23  3s@xmath04s @xmath0s@xmath26 ) transitions , there is no discrepancy among the f- values from grasp , mchf and as , but r is 0.56 . on the other hand , for the 8  10/11 ( 3s@xmath04s @xmath0s@xmath26 ",
    "3s@xmath04p @xmath0p@xmath14 ) transitions , r is 0.92 but the f- values differ by almost a factor of two . therefore ,",
    "as explained earlier , this assessment can not be rigorously applied , but the overall accuracy of the listed results for strong transitions appears to be satisfactory . for weak(er ) transitions , r is up to 10,000 , the discrepancies among f- values are larger , and hence the accuracy is lower . for similar reasons , the accuracy for the e2 ,",
    "m1 and m2 data is also lower , because most of these are weaker in comparison to the e1 transitions . finally , as for energy levels",
    ", we have calculated a- and f- values from fac also , and for most ( strong ) transitions the agreement with our grasp results is within @xmath8 20% .",
    "the lifetime @xmath54 for a level @xmath32 is determined as follows :    @xmath55    its measurement can directly lead to the assessment of accuracy of the a- values , particularly if a single transition dominates .",
    "therefore , in table 1 we have also listed our calculated lifetimes .",
    "as already stated , a- values for e1 transitions generally dominate , but for completeness we have also included the contributions from e2 , m1 and m2 .",
    "their inclusion is particularly important for those levels which do not connect via e1 transitions . @xcite",
    "have measured @xmath54 corresponding to the 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ",
    "3s@xmath04s @xmath0s@xmath26 transition to be 0.91@xmath560.04 ns , which compares well with our result of 0.996 ns .",
    "correspondingly , the measured f- value for this 2  8 transition is 0.130@xmath560.006 and our calculated result is 0.150 .",
    "however , determination of this f- value by several authors differ by up to a factor of two , as shown in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "similarly , their measured @xmath54 for the 3s@xmath05s @xmath0s@xmath26 level is 1.99@xmath560.12 ns , in close agreement with our result of 1.865 ns and the calculation of 2.501 ns by @xcite .",
    "however , in a private correspondence to @xcite , hibbert estimated @xmath54 to be 2.36 ns from improved calculations , and this improves the agreement between the theoretical results .",
    "finally , we also note that for this level apart from the dominant 116 and 216 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath14 ",
    "3s@xmath05s @xmath0s@xmath26 ) e1 transitions , the contributions of the 10  16 and 11  16 ( 3s@xmath04p @xmath0p@xmath14  3s@xmath05s @xmath0s@xmath26 ) e1 are also significant , as mentioned by @xcite .    the other measurements of @xmath54 available are by @xcite for the 3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p@xmath57 levels , which are 104@xmath5616 , 811@xmath5677 and 406@xmath5633 @xmath58s , respectively",
    ". however , our corresponding theoretical results for these levels ( 251 , 8004 and 3391 @xmath58s ) are overestimated by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the dominant contributing e1 transitions for these levels are 2  3 , 2  4 and 2  5 for which the f- values are 1.15@xmath2810@xmath59 , 1.17@xmath2810@xmath60 and 4.41@xmath2810@xmath60 , respectively , i.e. all transitions are very _ weak _ and for these there are large variations among different calculations , as discussed in section 3 .",
    "the other partial reason for the large discrepancies is the comparative inaccuracy of our calculated energy for level 2 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ) , as discussed in section 2 and shown in table 1 .",
    "finally , @xcite have made beam foil measurements of @xmath54 for the ( 3s@xmath0 ) 4p and 4f levels .",
    "their measured @xmath54 of 9.1@xmath560.5 and 3.4@xmath560.3 ns compare well with our corresponding calculations of 8.9 and 3.9 ns .",
    "for the calculations of @xmath13 , we have employed the _ dirac atomic @xmath4-matrix code _ ( darc ) of p. h. norrington and i. p. grant , available at the website http://web.am.qub.ac.uk / darc/. this is a relativistic version of the standard @xmath4-matrix code . since the code is based on the @xmath31 coupling scheme ( i.e. including fine - stucture ) the size of the hamiltonian increases in a calculation , but it ( generally ) leads to higher accuracy ( for @xmath13 and subsequently @xmath12 ) , especially for transitions among the _ fine - structure _ levels of a state , because resonances through the energies of degenerating levels are also taken into account . however , because si ii is only moderately heavy and degeneracy among its levels is not large ( see table 1 ) the results obtained should be comparable with those from the standard @xmath4-matrix code @xcite , provided the input parameters are similar .    the @xmath4-matrix radius adopted for si ii is 36.8 au , and 56 continuum orbitals have been included for each channel angular momentum in the expansion of the wave function .",
    "this large expansion is computationally more demanding as the corresponding size of the hamiltonian matrix is 15,154 .",
    "however , it allows us to compute @xmath13 up to an energy of 13 ryd , or equivalently values of effective collision strength @xmath12 ( see section 6 ) up to t@xmath16 = 6.0 @xmath2810@xmath61 k , more than an order of magnitude higher than the temperature of maximum abundance in ionisation equilibrium , i.e. 20,000 k @xcite .",
    "the maximum number of channels for a partial wave is 268 and all partial waves with angular momentum @xmath18 40 are included .",
    "inclusion of a large range of partial waves ensures convergence of @xmath13 for all forbidden and inter - combination transitions , and at all energies .",
    "however , for some allowed transitions a larger range is preferable because @xmath13 are not fully converged , particularly at higher energies .",
    "we demonstrate the variation of @xmath13 in fig .",
    "1 ( a , b and c ) at three energies ( 2 , 6 and 10 ryd ) and for three transitions , namely 1  12 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath21  3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath22 ) , 2  13 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23  3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath24 ) and 2  15 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0p@xmath22 ) .",
    "it may be seen in these figures that @xmath13 have ( almost ) converged up to an energy of 6 ryd , but not at the higher values . to improve the accuracy of @xmath13 at such energies ,",
    "i.e. to account for higher neglected partial waves , we have included a top - up , based on the coulomb - bethe approximation of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have also included such contributions for forbidden transitions , based on geometric series , but these are small .    in table 4",
    "we list our values of @xmath13 for transitions from the levels of the ground state ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath14 ) of si ii at three energies of 2 , 6 and 10 ryd .",

    "@xmath13 have fully converged within our partial waves range of @xmath18 40 .",
    "@xcite included partial waves with @xmath18 36 , comparable to ours and hence fully sufficient , yet his values of @xmath13 are consistently lower by up to @xmath8 23% for all transitions .",
    "on the other hand , his @xmath13 for _ allowed _ transitions are consistently higher by up to @xmath8 25% , as shown in fig . 3 for three , namely 1  12 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath21  3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath22 ) , 2 13 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23  3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath24 ) and 2  15 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0p@xmath22 ) .",
    "for all these transitions , @xmath13 have fully converged up to an energy of 6 ryd as shown in fig . 1 , and yet the tayal results for @xmath13 are consistently higher at all energies .",
    "for these transitions the f- values from our grasp and his mchf @xcite calculations agree to better than 10% , as shown in table 3 .",
    "however , in the scattering calculations @xcite has adopted slightly different wavefunctions , and therefore the f- values obtained may not be the same as listed in table 3 . in spite of these being comparatively strong transitions",
    ", the f- values do show significant variations as shown in table 3 of @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the f- values in the later calculations @xcite are higher than so will be the values of @xmath13 , but it can not be confirmed with the limited information available .",
    "apart from energy levels and radiative rates , excitation and de - excitation rates are required for plasma modelling , which are determined from the collision strengths ( @xmath13 ) . however , as already shown by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xmath13 does not vary smoothly within the thresholds region , because of the closed - channel ( feshbach ) resonances , especially for ( semi ) forbidden transitions . such resonances need to be resolved in a fine energy mesh to accurately account for their contribution . in most astrophysical ( and fusion ) plasmas , electrons have a _ maxwellian _ distribution of velocities , and thereofore an averaged value , known as _ effective _ collision strength ( @xmath12 ) is required , i.e.    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant , t@xmath16 electron temperature in k , and e@xmath65 the electron energy with respect to the final ( excited ) state . once the value of @xmath12 is known the corresponding results for the excitation q(i , j ) and de - excitation q(j , i ) rates can be easily obtained from the following equations :    @xmath66    and @xmath67 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the statistical weights of the initial ( @xmath47 ) and final ( @xmath32 ) states , respectively , and e@xmath48 is the transition energy .",
    "depending on the type of transition _ and _ temperature , the contribution of resonances may greatly enhance the values of @xmath12 over those of the background collision strengths ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "since @xmath12 for si ii are most important for up to t@xmath16 = 20,000 k ( @xmath8 0.13 ryd ) , the contribution of resonances is very significant for most transitions .",
    "in addition , values of @xmath13 should be calculated over a wide energy range ( above thresholds ) to obtain convergence of the integral in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , as demonstrated in fig . 7 of @xcite . for this reason",
    "we have calculated values of @xmath13 up to an energy of 13 ryd , as discussed in section 5 .    to resolve resonances",
    ", we have performed our calculations of @xmath13 in a narrow energy mesh of 0.001 ryd ( at over @xmath8 1500 energies ) in the thresholds region . in figs .",
    "4  6 we show resonances for three transitions , namely 1  2 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath21  3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ) , 2  4 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p@xmath22 ) and 2  7 ( 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0d@xmath24 ) , which are forbidden , inter - combination and allowed , respectively .",
    "furthermore , these transitions have specifically been selected because both @xcite and @xcite have shown resonances for these , and hence will facilitate us in understanding the differences in the corresponding results of @xmath12 .",
    "for the three transitions , the resonance structures are similar in all calculations , but their magnitude and background values ( @xmath27 ) differ slightly . while the @xmath27 of @xcite are on the higher side , those of @xcite are _ lower _ , particularly at energies below 0.8 ryd .",
    "we would like to stress here that their lower values of @xmath13 are not due to the lower range of included partial waves ( @xmath30 16 ) , because at these energies @xmath18 15 are sufficient for convergence , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1 _ and _ also confirmed with our similar plots for all three transitions with @xmath18 10 and @xmath18 20 .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath12 are listed in table 5 over a wide temperature range of log t@xmath16 = 3.7  5.5 k , suitable for applications to a wide range of laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . since @xmath12 is a slowly varying function of t@xmath16 ,",
    "corresponding data at any other temperature within this range can be easily interpolated , or may be requested from the first author . in table 6 , we compare our results of @xmath12 with those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for transitions from the levels of the ground state 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath14 to higher excited levels ( but only up to 3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0p@xmath22 ) , and at three temperatures of 5000 , 10,000 and 20,000 k. these transitions are the same as reported by @xcite . for a majority of transitions ,",
    "the @xmath12 of @xcite are the _ highest _ , although they are also lower for a few , such as 1  8/10/11 , and 2  8/11 .",
    "the differences between their @xmath12 and the other calculations are up to 50% .",
    "for all these transitions , the higher values of @xmath12 by tayal are because of his corresponding higher values of @xmath13 .",
    "we would like to stress here that both ourselves and tayal have included a comparable large range of partial waves and hence @xmath13 for all these transitions have fully _",
    "converged_.    since @xcite has reported @xmath12 for a wider range of transitions and temperatures , we make some more comparisons with our results .",
    "differences between the two sets of data are up to a factor of two ( and larger for only a few ) for many transitions , such as 3  8/11/12/13/14/15 and 4  8/12/13/14/15 . for most cases his @xmath12 values are higher , but are lower for a few . in fig .",
    "7 we compare our @xmath12 with those of tayal for three transitions , namely 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath23 ",
    "3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p@xmath57 , i.e. 2  3/4/5 , which are very important for diagnostics as stated in section 1 . towards the lower end of the temperature range",
    "his @xmath12 are significantly lower ( by a factor of 70 ) for the 2  3 transition and are higher by @xmath8 50% for 2  5 .",
    "such a behaviour by the tayal @xmath12 data appears to be anomalous in comparison with our results , particularly when there is a considerably closer agreement towards the higher end of the temperature range .",
    "some differences between the two sets of data are expected at lower temperatures because of the position of resonances , a slight shift of which may alter the values of @xmath12 . however , large discrepancies observed for these three ( and many other ) transitions are not normally possible unless very high and broad resonances are present ( or absent ) close to the threshold , which does not appear to be the case . @xcite does not show resonances for the 2  3 transition , but our @xmath13 are similar to that in fig .",
    "5 for 2  4 ( see also fig . 2 of @xcite )",
    ", except that the magnitudes are ( approximately ) half for both the background as well as the peaks .",
    "this is fully expected and therefore the @xmath12 of @xcite are clearly anomalous for the 2  3/4/5 transitions , at temperatures below 10 , 000 k.    in fig .",

    "furthermore , the discrepancy with our calculations increases with the temperature , although his values of @xmath13 differ more towards the lower end of the energy range ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . for the 1  14 , 2  13 and 2  15 transitions the f- values calculated from grasp and mchf are large and ( probably ) similar ( see table 3 ) , and yet the tayal values of @xmath12 are higher by @xmath8 50% . finally , we note that comparisons shown in fig .",
    "8 of @xcite with the @xmath12 of @xcite for the 3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p@xmath34  3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath22 ( i.e. 3/4  12 ) forbidden transitions must be incorrect , because the latter did not report results for these .",
    "this is likely because @xcite mistakenly labelled the 3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0d@xmath68 levels as 3s@xmath03d @xmath0d@xmath68 , but subsequently rectified this in a later paper @xcite .",
    "for the relevant 3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p@xmath34 ",
    "3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0d ( 3/4  6 ) transitions there are no discrepancies between the two calculations , as already shown in table 6",
    ". however , in comparison to our calculations , the @xmath12 of @xcite for the 3/4  12 transitions are overestimated by about a factor of two over the entire range of temperature .",
    "there is comparatively a better agreement ( within 20% ) between our results of @xmath12 and those of @xcite .",
    "however , their data are too limited for a thorough comparison . similarly , the earlier results of @xcite are comparable with ours , except for a few transitions , such as : 1  6/12 , 2  7/12 and 6  7 .",
    "their higher @xmath12 values for these transitions are a direct consequence of their larger f- values .",
    "nevertheless , the limitations of their data have already been pointed in section 1 . finally , as already noted in section 1",
    ", @xcite adopted the data of @xcite in analysing uv lines of si ii and found discrepancies between theory and observations . based on this",
    ", they estimated that the @xmath12 of @xcite for the 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath5  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath6p multiplet may be overestimated by a factor of 1.5 , but this is not supported by any calculations performed to date , including the present one .",
    "however , the @xcite @xmath12 for the 3s@xmath03p @xmath0p@xmath5  3s3p@xmath0 @xmath0d multiplet do appear to be overestimated by nearly the same factor .",
    "energies and lifetimes for the lowest 56 levels of si ii belonging to the @xmath11 5 configurations are reported , along with radiative rates for four types of transitions ( e1 , e2 , m1 and m2 ) , calculated with the grasp code .",
    "additionally , calculations have also been performed with the fac code for comparison purposes . based on comparisons with measurements and available theoretical results ,",
    "our energy levels are estimated to be accurate to @xmath8 0.1 ryd .",
    "however , scope remains for improvement , although the inclusion of extensive ci is not very helpful in improving the accuracy further .",
    "similarly , for a majority of ( strong ) transitions our listed a- values ( and other related parameters including lifetimes ) are assessed to be accurate to better than 20% .    for collision strengths @xmath13 and effective collision strengths @xmath12 , limited previous results are available for comparison . however , @xcite has reported data over a wide range of energy and temperature , listing values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 for 59 and 465 transitions , respectively .",
    "our results are much more extensive considering 1540 transitions among 56 levels .",
    "discrepancies of @xmath8 25% between our calculations of @xmath13 and those of @xcite are noted for several transitions , both allowed as well as forbidden . for most transitions his results are higher , but some are lower . we have included a large range of partial waves , our results for @xmath13 have fully converged at energies below 6 ryd , and for higher energies",
    "the contribution of higher neglected partial waves has been taken into account .",
    "therefore , we see no apparent deficiency in our work and estimate the accuracy of @xmath13 to be better than 20% for a majority of transitions .    for calculations of @xmath12 ,",
    "resonances in the thresholds energy region have been resolved in a fine mesh , and are observed to be significant for many transitions .",
    "however , differences with the corresponding results of @xcite are up to a factor of two for many transitions , and over the entire range of temperature from 10@xmath69 to 10@xmath70 k. for most transitions his @xmath12 values are overestimated , but some are underestimated .",
    "although tayal included an equally large range of partial waves and energy for calculating @xmath13 and resolved resonances to determine @xmath12 , the differences with our calculations are significant .",
    "in fact the energy resolution in his calculations was finer ( 0.00025 ryd ) in the thresholds region , but it should not make any appreciable difference in the reported results of @xmath12 , because the density of resonances is not very high , as seen in figs .",
    "46 . nevertheless , to confirm it we have performed additional calculations with a larger resolution of 0.0005 ryd at energies below 0.525 ryd .",
    "these calculations affect transitions among the lowest 5 levels and particularly at lower temperatures .",
    "however , differences between the two sets of calculations for all transitions are less than 0.4% at all temperatures .",
    "therefore , we have confidence in our results although scope remains for improvement .",
    "we believe that the complete set of data presented here for both radiative and excitation rates for transitions in si ii will be useful for diagnosing and modelling of astrophysical plasmas , and that some of the existing discrepancies noted by @xcite and @xcite will be resolved .",

    "<S> these collision strengths are averaged over a maxwellian velocity distribution and results listed over a wide range of temperatures , up to 10@xmath3 k. our data are compared with earlier @xmath4-matrix calculations and differences noted , up to a factor of two , for several transitions . although scope remains for improvement , the accuracy for our results of collision strengths and effective collision strengths is assessed to be about 20% for a majority of transitions .    </S>",
