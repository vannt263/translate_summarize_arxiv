    "according to the experimentally realizable phases that support topological objects , the fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) effect , since its discovery  @xcite , has appealed to tremendous theoretical and experimental attractions and achieved us a collection of methods to study the strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations in the fqh liquids can have fractional charges and obey fractional statistics  @xcite . within a serious of filling factors of fqh states ,",
    "some of them may support more exotic excitations with non - abelian statistics , which have potential applications in the topological protected quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the fqh with an even denominator on the first landau level at filling factor @xmath2  @xcite is the most studied state that belongs to the family of non - abelian fqh states .",
    "since the seminal work of moore and read  @xcite , a connection between the wavefunction of the fqh state and the conformal field theory ( cft ) has been established .",
    "thereafter , a series of non - abelian fqh states have been proposed which are described by the @xmath3 topological quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "the index @xmath4 describes the clustering properties in the model wavefunction and has a connection with its filling factor @xmath5 .",
    "they are addressed read - rezayi @xmath1 quantum hall states since the corresponding wavefunctions can be calculated from the correlation functions in the @xmath1 parafermionic conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "notablely , it was found  @xcite that the @xmath1 fqh states are the exact ground state of certain hamiltonian with @xmath6-body interaction for all integers @xmath7 .",
    "further more , bernevig et.al .",
    "@xcite recently found that the homogeneous polynomial part of the @xmath1 fqh wavefunction can be obtained recursively from the jack polynomials which is one of the polynomial solutions for calogero - sutherland hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 fqh wavefunctions in this language are labelled by a negative parameter @xmath8 and a root configuration ( or partition ) .",
    "because of its computation advantages , we thereafter use the jacks to produce the model wavefunctions for the ground state and their quasiparticle excitations in the following calculation .",
    "the measurement of the transport properties of the quasiparticles propagating along the edge of the fqh states is crucial for identification of the topological nature of the systems . as standard practice in the noise and interference experiments  @xcite , quantum point contacts",
    "are introduced to allow quasiparticles propagating on one edge to tunnel to another .",
    "this motivated us to study the quasiparticle tunneling amplitudes in fqh liquids in the disk geometry  @xcite . on the disk",
    ", we considered a tunneling potential along a specific direction @xmath9 . the tunneling amplitudes exhibit interesting scaling behavior , whose exponent is related to the conformal dimension and the charge of the tunneling quasiparticles .",
    "specificaly , from an effective field theory analysis , we found  @xcite that the bare quasiparticle tunneling matrix element satisfies a scaling function @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the ground state and quasihole wavefunction respectively and @xmath13 is the conformal dimension of the quasiparticle operators .",
    "@xmath14 $ ] is the edge - edge tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "the function @xmath15 reveals the dependence on the tunneling distance @xmath16 .",
    "we analyzed the tunneling amplitude of the abelian quasiparticle , such as the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quasiholes in the laughlin state at @xmath19 and @xmath20 quasihole in the moore - read state at @xmath2 .",
    "as shown in table 1 of ref .",
    ", an excellent agreement with the above relation @xmath21 was found .",
    "however , for non - abelian excitations , such as @xmath22 quasihole excitation in the moore - read state , it is likely that there is a correction on the scaling parameter , i.e. , @xmath23 incidentally , the anomalous term can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the conformal dimension for the neutral part of the non - abelian quasihole operator .",
    "we therefore , in the case of disk geometry , had an argument that this anomalous term may origin from the unconstrained tunneling of the neutral parafermions . however , because of the curvature the disk geometry , for a finite size system , the tunneling distance is limited by the radius of the system which is proportional to @xmath26 . a natural way to overcome",
    "this problem is putting the electrons on cylinder or torus . comparing to the disk",
    ", the cylinder geometry has advantages that there is no curvature difference between landau orbitals and the edge - edge distance is linearly proportional to the system size @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , the edge - edge distance can be easily tuned via varying the aspect ratio , by comparison , in a longer range .",
    "our recent work on the quasihole tunneling and entanglement entropy in laughlin state on cylinder  @xcite found that a critial length scale of the edge - edge distance exists .",
    "it can be explained as a threshold value that the two edges of the cylinder can be treated independently , or the effects of the edge - edge interaction can only be neglected while @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "therefore if we want to consider the scaling behavior of the quasiparticle tunneling between two independent edges with a longer tunneling distance , the cylinder geometry is a better choice than disk . in this paper",
    ", we study the physical properties of the fqh liquids and reconsider the quasiparticle tunneling amplitudes scaling on cylinder , especially focus on the scaling of the non - abelian quasiparticles tunneling .",

    "section provides a conclusion and discussion of the paper .",
    "in the disk geometry  @xcite , we considered a single - particle tunneling potential @xmath33 , which breaks the rotational symmetry .",
    "it defines a tunneling path for fqh quasiparticles under the gate influence at a quantum point contact .",
    "the tunneling amplitude for a quasihole to the fqh droplet edge is @xmath34 . the most efficient way of getting these wavefunction is by the help of jack polynomial approachment  @xcite .",
    "generally , jacks belongs to a family of symmetric multivariate polynomials of the complex particle coordinates .",
    "potentially , they can be the bosonic version of fqh wavefunction ( appending the ubiquitous gaussian factor @xmath35 on disk ) , or fermionic version with an extra vandermonde determinant @xmath36 .",
    "a jack @xmath37 is parameterized by a negative rational number @xmath8 , which is related to the clustering properties of the wavefunction , and a root configuration @xmath38 , which satisfies a generalized pauli exclusion principle and from which one can derive a set of monomials that form a basis for the wavefunction . for the read - rezayi @xmath1 parafermion state , the @xmath39 and the corresponding root configuration can be expressed by a binary format `` @xmath40 '' in the occupation representation of landau orbitals .",

    "therefore , a natural question is that whether the scaling conjection of eq .",
    "( [ scalingconj ] ) works for large tunneling distance ? with this motivation , we reconsider the scaling behavior of the tunneling amplitudes for @xmath1 parafermion states on cylinder in the following section .",
