    "cosmic strings @xcite , i.e. linear topological defects analogous to vortex lines in condensed matter physics , frequently appear as solutions of high energy field theories , including grand unified ( gut ) or superstring theories , with many cosmological and astrophysical consequences @xcite that have not all been fully investigated .",
    "many microscopic models have been discussed , providing direct contact with the underlying field theory .    even in the simplest models such as the popular @xmath1 abelian higgs model with a mexican hat potential ,",
    "there are no known analytical solutions , straight and static ones @xcite having only been constructed numerically .",
    "these _ abelian  higgs _ or _ nielsen  olesen _ ( no ) strings have a localized energy - momentum tensor and a quantized magnetic - like flux with the magnetic - like field pointing in the direction of the string axis .",
    "numerical solutions were found in refs .",
    "@xcite and their gravitational effects have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the no string and flux tube widths are inversely proportional , respectively , to the higgs and the gauge boson masses .",
    "when these masses are equal , the strings are said to saturate the bogomolonyi  prasad ",
    "sommerfield ( bps ) bound @xcite which guarantees stability ; the fields then satisfy first order differential equations whose solution is also not analytically known and have thus to be constructed numerically . furthermore , it was shown that bps strings remain so in curved space - time , i.e. , they satisfy the same energy bound as in flat space - time @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings however can , and more often than not do @xcite , carry persistent ( _ superconducting _",
    "@xcite ) currents that can be spacelike ( like an ordinary current ) , timelike ( akin to a charge ) , or null ( lightlike ) .",
    "currents up to @xmath2 amps ( gut case ) can be induced by either bosonic or fermionic charge carriers . in the former case the scalar field that undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking , thereby leading to the formation of the strings , couples non - trivially to a second scalar field .",
    "for appropriate choices of the self - couplings and vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields , this second scalar can form a condensate in the core of the string .    while standard cosmic strings have energy per unit length @xmath3 equal to their tension @xmath4 , this ceases to be true in the presence of a current .",
    "the relation between the energy per unit length and the tension of a superconducting string solution of the @xmath5 model has been discussed in detail in @xcite and it has been suggested that the equation of state is of logarithmic form @xcite . this has been confirmed numerically in @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we report on a new type of solutions in the @xmath6 model : superconducting strings with radially excited condensates .",
    "these radially excited solutions possess a finite number of nodes in the scalar field function associated to the unbroken @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "radial excitations of solitonic - like solutions are quite well known : they appear in non - topological soliton systems such as @xmath7-balls and boson stars @xcite in which an unbroken symmetry exists as well as in topological soliton systems such as magnetic monopoles @xcite in which a continuous symmetry gets spontaneously broken .",
    "we study witten s model @xcite with only one of the @xmath1s gauged @xcite . using a metric with signature @xmath8",
    ", the lagrangian density reads @xmath9 where the potential is given by @xmath10 and the gauge covariant derivative is @xmath11 .",
    "the ansatz for the fields in cylindrical coordinates @xmath12 is @xmath13 { \\mbox{d}}\\theta \\ \\ , \\ \\",

    "the boundary conditions at the string axis @xmath20 and at infinity read @xmath21 in what follows , we shall assume the microscopic underlying parameters to be such that the vortices under consideration are of type ii @xcite , and therefore restrict attention to the minimal energy case @xmath22 .",
    "to motivate the existence of excited solutions , let us begin by working in a regime where the condensate is sufficiently small that we can neglect its backreaction on @xmath23 and the nonlinear term in .",
    "taking the boundary conditions into account , we assume the following simple ansatz for the higgs field function with qualitatively similar results @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 is a freely adjustable constant giving the characteristic size of higgs field variation . for @xmath26 , the linearized version of equation ( [ condensate ] ) then becomes a modified bessel equation whose only solution decaying strictly faster that @xmath27 at infinity is are @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an integration constant . to solve the equation in the interior region @xmath30 ,",
    "it is useful to define the variable @xmath31 and the function @xmath32 by @xmath33 f\\left[y(x)\\right]$ ] .",
    "one then gets @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "this is the confluent hypergeometric equation  @xcite , whose only regular solution at the origin is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the laguerre function with parameter @xmath38 and @xmath39 is another integration constant .",
    "so , for @xmath30 we find @xmath40 the requirement that @xmath41 and @xmath42 should be continuous at @xmath43 gives the relation between @xmath44 and @xmath45 as well as a constraint on @xmath38 with a discrete set of solutions , see @xcite for more details . in the limit @xmath46",
    ", the solutions are localized near the origin , so that is valid globally and regular solutions are given in terms of the laguerre polynomials  @xcite , obtained for @xmath47 . as the @xmath48 laguerre polynomial has @xmath49 strictly positive roots ( see the laguerre polynomials with @xmath50 and @xmath51 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : laguerre1 ] , dashed lines ) , the corresponding function @xmath41 has @xmath49 nodes . in practice ,",
    "the finite value of @xmath25 gives a cutoff on @xmath49 , of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "for the numerical solutions shown in the figure , we estimate that @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 , respectively , the latter is still expected to give the correct order of magnitude . ] .",
    "since nonlinear effects tend to reduce the number of solutions , we thus expect to have a few of them when working with the full set of equations .",
    "this is compatible with the fact that we found them only up to @xmath57 for these parameters .",
    "we have solved numerically the coupled set of non - linear differential equations ( [ gauge ] ) , ( [ higgs ] ) and ( [ condensate ] ) , subject to the appropriate boundary conditions using an iterative newton - raphson method with automatic grid selection @xcite .",
    "the relative errors of our solutions are typically of the order of @xmath58 .",
    "we have studied a large number of parameter values , but report only on one specific case that is generic enough and displays the main qualitative features . the choice was made in order to fulfill the necessary constraints ( see e.g. @xcite ) and to allow the existence of solutions in the chiral limit @xmath59 . the chiral solutions with @xmath60 nodes for our choice of parameters",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : laguerre1 ] , together with the approximate perturbative solutions .",
    "the constant @xmath61 is extracted from the numerical data .",
    "our numerical results show that for this choice of parameters chiral solutions can only possess up to 2 nodes , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f0w ] , where we give the value of @xmath63 in function of the state parameter @xmath64 .",
    "this shows that , while for node number @xmath65 electric , magnetic as well as chiral solutions exist , @xmath66 solutions are always electric .",
    "[ fig : current ] displays the current of the superconducting string given ( in rescaled units ) by @xmath67 .",
    "we observe that the maximal possible current on the string in the magnetic regime decreases with increasing node number .    to determine their potential consequences , it is important to know whether these radially excited solutions are stable .",
    "here we work at the classical level and apply the macroscopic stability criterion formulated by carter @xcite .",
    "the velocities of longitudinal ( ) and transverse ( ) perturbations are related to the energy per unit length @xmath68 and the tension @xmath69 by @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "both should be real for the string to be stable ; this requires @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "our numerical results for the fundamental and the first three excited solutions are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_eps ] .",
    "these plots show clearly that in the electric regime ( @xmath74 ) all solutions have @xmath75 and @xmath76 and hence are classically stable , while in the magnetic regime ( @xmath77 ) all solutions are classically unstable since @xmath78 .",
    "( however , it was found in @xcite that magnetic solutions with @xmath79 are stable in some domains of parameters space .",
    "we expect this should remain true for excited solutions with @xmath80 . )",
    "the above strings are of the purely spatially local type as far as the current is concerned , and this may , in some gut - based models for instance , be considered unlikely , as most symmetries then are expected to be gauged . indeed , many superconducting cosmic string models consider actual electromagnetic currents , and may even be used to produce large scale primordial magnetic fields .",
    "the excited states found here are based on an uncoupled model , so one may wonder whether they are still present when an electromagnetic coupling is added , i.e. when the @xmath81 field is given a gauge coupling . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the influence of such an extra coupling is expected to be mostly negligible on the microstructure and we conjecture that excited solutions still exist in this case .",
    "although we found some of these states to be classically stable , the quantum mechanical situation could be different .",
    "it remains to be investigated but suffice it to say at this stage that the quantum lifetime of our configurations should be very much parameter dependent . for parameters such that this lifetime is of the order of the hubble time now , one would then expect a steady flow of very high energy particles previously trapped in the excited states , which would contribute to the high energy cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "the microstructure of the new states discussed in this letter is not as simple as that of an ordinary ( @xmath82 ) current - carrying string . as a result , the time evolution of a network of such strings should be more involved to evaluate .",
    "for instance , intercommutation probabilities will now depend not only on the current amplitude but also on the excited level of both interacting strings .",
    "as the current density may vanish at some specific points around both strings , the resulting state will be highly unstable and relax towards a new equilibrium configuration , emitting many particles in the process .",
    "the vorton case is , like the above , much more complicated , and many unresolved questions arise .",
    "first is the nature of vortons : are they of one kind , all in the ground state of the current , or can excited state vortons be formed ? as the string loops shrink , it may become energetically favorable for the entire loop to emit particles , evolve towards the ground state @xmath82 , and subsequently shrink further .",
    "such processes might even help in reducing the vorton density and hence alleviate the vorton excess problem @xcite .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu_eps ] , the ensemble of current - carrying cosmic strings is now expected , given the excited states , to exist in a discrete set labeled by the number of nodes @xmath49 .",
    "all gravitational consequences , for instance , would be repeated as if there were different species of strings .",
    "the deficit angle of space - time , which implies background radiation fluctuations or 21-cm spectrum modifications , among other consequences , could now be measured in a discrete set : such an observation would provide a concrete proof not only of the existence of our excited solutions , but also of cosmic strings themselves !    finally , we would like to remark that the main qualitative features of these solutions persist in a dynamical space - time , i.e. when coupling the matter equations to the einsteinian metric .",
    "we have checked this numerically and will report on the details of our results elsewhere @xcite .",
