    "@xmath21 , the hierarchy is inverted , with @xmath16 and @xmath15 requiring one and two  helicity - flips , respectively .",
    "helicity - flip suppression can be estimated by recalling that the probability for a positive helicity free fermion to have negative spin along some axis is given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the angle between the axis and the momentum vector . for a @xmath20 meson in a symmetric configuration",

    "the form factor helicity suppression in @xmath27 should be approximately @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the transverse momentum of the outgoing @xmath18 quark .",

    "this implies that the longitudinal polarizations should satisfy @xmath422 in the standard model .",
    "consequently , @xmath423 would indicate that @xmath424-spin violating new physics entering mainly in the @xmath425 channel is at least partially responsible for the small values of @xmath426 .",

    "if left - handed , i.e. , of the form @xmath428 , then @xmath429 would be maintained .",
    "finally , @xmath8 @xmath7 violation is possible in all qcd penguin amplitudes , given that the annihilation topology components can be comparable to , or greater than the penguin topology components .",
    "this is especially true of decays to @xmath430 and @xmath154 final states which , unlike decays to @xmath431 final states , do not receive large contributions from @xmath432 chirality penguin topology matrix elements .",
