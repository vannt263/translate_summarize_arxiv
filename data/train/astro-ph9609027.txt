    "the study of the cosmic velocity field is a very promising and crucial area for the understanding of large  scale structure formation . since the early work of rubin et al .",
    "( 1976 ) and burstein et al .",
    "( 1987 ) a lot of effort has been invested in the measurement of the large  scale velocity flows ( see dekel 1994 and strauss & willick 1995 for recent reviews of the subject ) . particularly important for the analysis of these measured velocity fields has been the development of the parameter - free potent method by bertschinger & dekel ( 1989 ) . based on the plausible assumption of potential flow it enabled the construction and study of the full three - dimensional velocity field in a fair fraction of the local universe out of the measurements of galaxy line - of - sight peculiar velocities .",
    "this opened up and triggered a host of studies addressing various issues and aspects of cosmic velocity flows and provided a versatile ground for testing the scenario of large  scale structure formation .",
    "the cosmic velocity field is particularly interesting because of its close and direct relation to the underlying field of mass fluctuations .",
    "indeed , on these large scales the acceleration , and therefore the velocity , of any object is expected to have an exclusively gravitational origin so that it should be independent of its nature , whether it concerns a dark matter particle or a bright galaxy . moreover",
    ", the linear theory of the generic gravitational instability scenario predicts that at every location in the universe the local velocity is related to the local acceleration , and hence the local mass density fluctuation field , through the same universal function @xmath1 ( peebles 1980 ) .",
    "as the linear theory provides a good description on those large scales the use of this straightforward relation implies the possibility of a simple inversion of the measured velocity field into a field that is directly proportional to the field of local mass density fluctuations @xmath2 .",
    "such a procedure can be used to infer the value of @xmath0 , through a comparison of the resulting field with the field of mass density fluctuations in the same region .",
    "however , the determination of this mass density fluctuation field through the measurement of the local galaxy density fluctuation field , @xmath3 , may be contrived .",
    "the galaxy distribution may be representing a biased view of the underlying mass density fluctuation field .",
    "a common and rather simplistic assumption is that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related via a linear bias factor @xmath5 , @xmath6 however , although several physical mechanisms have been invoked to explain such a _ linear bias model _ ( see e.g. dekel & rees 1987 ) , by lack of a complete and self - consistent theory of galaxy formation it should as yet only be considered as a numerical factor roughly describing the contrast of galaxy density fluctuations with respect to the mass density fluctuations .    the comparison between the observed local galaxy density fluctuation field and the local cosmic velocity field , invoking equation  ( [ eq : def_bias ] ) , will therefore provide an estimate of the ratio , @xmath7 various studies , most notably the ones based on a comparison of the galaxy density field inferred from the iras redshift survey of strauss et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and the local velocity field reconstructed by the potent algorithm ( bertschinger et al . 1990 ; dekel , bertschinger & faber 1990 ; see dekel 1994 ) , have yielded estimates of @xmath8 in the range @xmath9 ( see dekel 1994 , strauss & willick 1995 , for compilations of results ) .",
    "7.5 cm    it is then of crucial interest to find ways to disentangle the contribution of @xmath0 and @xmath5 to @xmath8 .",
    "a variety of methods using _ intrinsic _ properties of the large - scale velocity field have been proposed to achieve this .",
    "one such attempt is based on the reconstruction of the initial density field from the observed distribution of matter through the use of the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the further assumption of gaussianity of the initial density probability distribution leads to a constraint on @xmath0 ( nusser & dekel 1993 ) .",
    "although promising , the quantitative results of this approach may be questionable , as the zeldovich approximation provides non - exact results for the induced non - gaussian properties of the density and velocity field ( bouchet et al 1992 , bernardeau 1994a ) .",
    "another interesting attempt is the one by dekel & rees ( 1994 ) , who exploit the simple observation that voids have a maximal `` emptiness '' of @xmath10 . on the basis of the corresponding analysis of the measured velocity field in and around a void region these authors inferred a lower limit on @xmath0 of about 0.3 .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a method to determine the value of @xmath0 that finds its origin in a statistical analysis of the velocity field .",
    "the foundation for this method is formed by analytical work within the context of the perturbation theory for the evolution of density and velocity fluctuations . in particular , it focuses on the statistical properties of the divergence of the locally smoothed velocity field @xmath11 , which is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the time derivative of the comoving coordinate @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the method , proposed by bernardeau ( 1994a ) and bernardeau et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , exploits the relations between the lower order moments of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of @xmath11 , and the explicit dependence on @xmath0 of these relations .",
    "the specific form of these relations were derived under the assumption of gaussian initial conditions .",
    "the viability of the method was demonstrated by bernardeau et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who used the strong @xmath0-dependence of the skewness factor of @xmath11 , or rather the third normalized moment @xmath16 , @xmath17 to estimate successfully the density parameter in n - body simulations of structure formation .",
    "a tentative application of this method to the observed velocity field as processed by the potent method yielded results consistent with @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , subsequent work by bernardeau & van de weygaert ( 1996 ) showed that the theoretical predictions concerning the complete overall shape of the pdf of @xmath11 were valid .",
    "they demonstrated this by comparison of the analytically predicted pdf with the pdf determined from a large cdm n - body simulation with @xmath18 . in order to deal with the major complication of obtaining clean and straightforward numerical estimates of the statistical properties of the velocity divergence field from the discretely sampled velocity field , they developed two new techniques .",
    "these techniques exploit the minimum triangulation properties of voronoi and delaunay tessellations ( voronoi 1908 , delaunay 1934 , see van de weygaert 1991 , 1994 for references and applications ) .",
    "a voronoi tessellation of a set of particles is a space filling network of polyhedral cells , with each cell being defined by one of the particles as its nucleus and delimiting the part of space closer to this nucleus than to any other of the particles .",
    "closely related to the voronoi tessellation is the delaunay tessellation , a space filling lattice of tetrahedra ( in three dimensions ) .",
    "each of the tetrahedra in the delaunay tessellation has four particles of the set as its vertices , such that the corresponding circumscribing sphere does not have any other particle inside . through the duality relation of the voronoi and the delaunay tessellation it is possible to obtain one from the other",
    ".    in the method based on the voronoi tessellation",
    " the `` voronoi method ''  the velocity field is defined to be uniform within each voronoi polyhedron , with the velocity at every location within each cell being equal to that of its nucleus .",
    "the obvious implication of such an interpolation scheme is that the only regions of space where the velocity divergence , as well as the shear and vorticity , acquires a non - zero value is in the polygonal walls that separate the cells .",
    "while the voronoi method can be regarded as a zeroth order interpolation scheme , yielding a discontinuous velocity field , the `` delaunay method '' can be seen as the corresponding first order scheme .",
    "basically it constructs the velocity field within each delaunay tetrahedron through linear interpolation between the velocities of the four defining particles .",
    "evidently , the velocity field constructed by the delaunay method is a field of uniform velocity field gradients within each delaunay cell . in",
    "the following we consider the statistical properties of the local velocity divergence when it is filtered by a top - hat window function following a _ volume weighting _ prescription .",
    "in practice the local filtered divergence is computed on @xmath19 grid points in all cases .",
    "depending on the method used to define the velocity field , the filtered divergence is given by a sum of intersections of a sphere with either planar polygonal walls or tetrahedra ( each of them being multiplied by the local divergence ) divided by the volume of the sphere .",
    "in such a volume weighting scheme the filtered quantities do not depend on the local number density of tracers .",
    "but of course the more numerous they are , the more accurately determined are the local divergences . for an extensive description and preliminary tests of the two techniques we refer to bernardeau & van de",
    "weygaert ( 1996 ) .    with the intention of demonstrating the potential and practical applicability of our method",
    ", this paper presents the results of a systematic study of the @xmath0 dependence of the moments and the pdf of the velocity divergence @xmath11 in n - body simulations of structure formation , using the numerical schemes of the voronoi and the delaunay method . to this end",
    ", we will first recall the relevant theoretical results on the statistical properties of @xmath11 in section [ sec : pt ] , thereby underlining the main features of importance to our study .",
    "this theoretical groundwork is followed by section [ sec : num ] , containing the presentation of the numerical results of the statistical analysis of pm n - body simulations of structure formation in @xmath18 and @xmath20 universes . while the first subsection ,   [ sec : large_sample ] , concerns the statistical quantities that were determined in a very large sample and thus with maximum attainable accuracy , the second subsection ",
    "[ sec : dilut ] is devoted to the issue to what extent these results get affected when the sample is strongly diluted . the latter is particularly important as we are interested in the reliability of our method for samples with a number density comparable to that of available galaxy catalogues .",
    "also of immediate relevance for a practical application is the question of how far the results of the statistical analysis get influenced when the velocity of the particles in the sample are known along only one direction .",
    "this issue , of crucial importance within the context of the statistical analysis of observational catalogues , is treated in a third subsection , in   [ sec:1d ] . finally ,",
    "following the successful application of our method under the circumstances described above , we conclude with a summary and a discussion of possible complications and prospects for our statistical method to infer a bias - independent value of @xmath0 .",
    "perturbation theory ( pt ) is extremely useful for the study and analytical description of the mildly non linear evolution of density and velocity fields . in particular within the context of structure forming out of gaussian initial conditions perturbation theory",
    "has been extensively developed in a large body of work ( see e.g. bernardeau 1994a , b ) . in the case of these gaussian initial conditions",
    "the complete set of moments of the smoothed velocity and density fields can be computed analytically , in particular if these fields are top - hat filtered .",
    "the corresponding pdf can be computed through re - summation of the series of moments .",
    "one of the most straightforward and useful results in the context of perturbation theory is the relation between the third moment @xmath21 and the second moment @xmath22 of the probability distribution function of @xmath11 , @xmath23 the coefficient @xmath16 depends on the cosmological parameter @xmath0 , on the shape of the power spectrum , on the geometry of the window function that has been used to filter the velocity field and even on the value of the cosmological constant @xmath24 , although the latter is an almost negligible weak dependence .",
    "in fact , the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath0 is substantially stronger than the one of the equivalent coefficient for density field .",
    "for instance , for a top - hat window function and a power law initial power spectrum of index @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 one obtains the following expression for @xmath16 , @xmath27.\\ ] ] as @xmath16 can be directly determined from observations , one can use its strong dependence on @xmath0 to obtain an estimate of @xmath0 , as has been done by bernardeau et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "more generally , perturbation theory enables one to infer the whole set of the cumulants @xmath28 to their leading order .",
    "all of them are related to the second moment via the relation @xmath29 and as in the case of @xmath16 all the coefficients @xmath30 possess a strong dependence on the value of @xmath0 ( bernardeau 1994b ) . to a good approximation",
    ", this dependence on cosmological parameters can be written as @xmath31 this property , given here for the moments , naturally extends itself to the shape of the complete velocity divergence pdf @xmath32 .",
    "this can be directly appreciated from the work by bernardeau ( 1994b ) , who showed that the pdf can be calculated from its moments @xmath30 and the value of @xmath33 through a laplace transform of its generating function @xmath34 @xmath35       \\d\\theta\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : pdf_theor_exact}\\ ] ] the moment generating function @xmath36 , given by @xmath37 can be related to the spherical collapse dynamics in the cosmology under consideration ( see appendix a ) .",
    "although this calculation is almost intractable in the general case , it has been shown that at least in one particular case one can evaluate this expression analytically . in the specific case of a power law density perturbation spectrum with an index @xmath38 in combination with a top - hat smoothing , it is possible to invoke some approximations that enable the derivation of a simple analytic fit for the pdf @xmath32 ) presented here is actually more accurate if @xmath39 . ]",
    "( see appendix a ) .",
    "this fit is given by @xmath40/\\kappa^{1/2}+      [ \\lambda-1]/\\lambda^{1/2})^{-3/2 } \\over \\kappa^{3/4 } ( 2\\pi)^{1/2 }      \\sigma_{\\theta}}\\ , \\nonumber \\\\      & \\times &      \\exp\\left[- { \\theta^2\\over 2\\lambda       \\sigma_{\\theta}^2}\\right]\\,{\\rm d}\\theta ,       \\label{eq : pdf_theor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42    16.7 cm    7.8 cm    the behaviour of this function @xmath32 has been illustrated in figure [ fig : pdf_theor ] for various values of @xmath0 and @xmath43 .",
    "qualitatively , one can see that the dependence of the shape on @xmath0 reveals itself in two ways : ( 1 ) the location of its cut - off at high positive values of @xmath11 and ( 2 ) the location of its peak .    as for ( 1 ) , the maximum value that @xmath11 can obtain is known exactly and is not dependent on the approximations that have been invoked to derive expression ( [ eq : pdf_theor ] ) @xmath44 the value of @xmath45 determines the location of the cut - off , and therefore the maximum expansion rate in voids .",
    "the value of 1.5 is the difference in value of the hubble parameter in an empty , @xmath46 , universe and that of an einstein - de sitter universe , @xmath18 .",
    "evidently , this is reflecting the fact that the interior of the deepest voids locally mimic the behaviour of an @xmath46 universe .",
    "recall that the suggestion by dekel & rees ( 1994 ) of using the maximum emptiness of voids to constrain @xmath0 is also based on a similar feature .",
    "also quite sensitive to the value of @xmath0 are the position of the peak of the distribution function @xmath32 , i.e. the most likely value of @xmath11 , and the overall shape of @xmath32 . using the edgeworth expansion ( juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1995 , bernardeau & kofman 1995 ) one can show that the value of @xmath11 for which the distribution reaches its maximum is given by @xmath47 in fact , a procedure exploiting this dependence of shape and peak location of @xmath32 will probably yield a more robust measure of @xmath0 than the maximum value of @xmath45 as it will be less bothered by the noise in the tails .",
    "by means of numerical simulations we have investigated the discussed dependence of the pdf of @xmath11 .",
    "these n - body simulations use a particle - mesh ( pm ) code ( moutarde et al . 1991 ) with a @xmath48 grid to follow the evolution of a system of @xmath48 particles .",
    "for our project we used two simulations , one with @xmath0 having a value of @xmath18 and the second one of @xmath49 . by analyzing the latter at different time - steps",
    "we explore situations for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "the particle distribution in the two simulations corresponds to a density and velocity fluctuation field with a @xmath50 spectrum .",
    "as can be seen in table  [ tab : cumulant ] , the variances @xmath43 do not differ significantly for the different values of @xmath0 for a given filtering radius .",
    "the fact that the values of the variance are comparable simplifies a comparison of the pdf substantially , which makes the interpretation in terms of the intrinsic @xmath0 dependence more straightforward .",
    "the first step of our analysis concerns an exploration of the velocity field using a large number of tracers . for this study",
    "the number of selected particles in each simulation is about 70,000 , which for a cell radius of about 6% of the box size leads to a mean number of 67 particles per cell .",
    "the selection procedure used here is deliberately biased towards low - density regions by inducing it to retain a uniform density of particles all over the simulation box . except for its goal of achieving a better velocity field coverage of low - density regions such a selection bias",
    "is not expected to influence the velocity field analysis .",
    "the methods that we use to analyze the simulations are exactly the same ones as described by bernardeau & van de weygaert ( 1996 ) .",
    "in fact , at this stage we only used the delaunay method to calculate numerically the shape of the pdf of the velocity divergence .",
    "the results for the case of a large number of velocity field tracers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_large_sample ] .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for the values of @xmath16 and @xmath51 ( see table  [ tab : cumulant ] ) , as well as with the theoretical shape of the pdf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_theor ] ) .",
    "it is in particular worth noting that the specific features expected from equation  ( [ eq : pdf_theor ] ) are indeed confirmed by the numerical results .",
    "notably , the locations of the cut - off , which are very sensitive to rare event discrepancies , are well reproduced ( solid and dotted lines ) .",
    "moreover , as can be observed from the insets , also the position and shape of the peak have been reproduced very well ( solid lines ) , providing a strong discriminatory tool between different values of @xmath0 .    within the context of these observations",
    ", we should issue a few side remarks .",
    "although the shape ( [ eq : pdf_theor ] ) is very attractive because it is a close analytic form , one should have in mind that it is only approximate .",
    "indeed it is derived from an approximate expression for the cumulant generating function .",
    "the differences do not reveal for the overall shape ( the logarithmic plots ) but are significant for the shape of the peaks . for calculating the theoretical predictions we",
    "are then forced to use a more accurate description of the cumulants . to achieve this we use",
    "the relations ( a.13 , a.14 ) with @xmath52 ( the expression [ eq : pdf_theor ] corresponds to @xmath38 ) in the integral ( a.15 ) which is then computed numerically .",
    "it is still an approximate expression , but it yields the correct value for @xmath16 and a very good approximation for the higher order cumulants .",
    "we should emphasize that this slight modification is only instrumental in obtaining the correct shape of the pdf around its maximum , which is indeed almost entirely determined by the values of the low order moments .",
    "this may be understood for example from the properties of the edgeworth expansion , for which we refer to juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1995 and bernardeau & kofman 1995 .",
    "in order to check the robustness of the results when only a limited number of tracers for the velocity field is available , we performed numerical experiments where only 10,000 particles are used to trace the velocity field .",
    "the selection of the sample points in this diluted sample is completely random and does not invoke the specific biased selection procedure that was used in the case described in the former subsection . for this case of diluted samples , we used both the delaunay and the voronoi methods for analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_small_sample ] shows the pdfs obtained with both methods , for an @xmath18 simulation and for an @xmath53 simulation .",
    "both the voronoi and the delaunay methods appear to yield numerical results that are in reasonably good agreement with the predicted pdf . particularly encouraging is the result born out by the insets , namely the fact that the shape of the peak can still be used as a strong discriminatory tool between different values of @xmath0 .",
    "investigating fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_small_sample ] in somewhat more detail , we can observe that the results obtained by the two methods are affected somewhat differently by the dilution procedure .",
    "the pdfs obtained with the voronoi method generally possess a less sharply defined tail at the side of the high @xmath11 values .",
    "this effect appears to be stronger for the low @xmath0 case .",
    "this behaviour may originate in the fact that the divergence is localized to a limited part of space , non - zero values being confined to the walls of the tessellation . in such a situation poisson like errors in the measurements are expected to become particularly prominent in the heavily diluted areas of the void regions .",
    "an additional difference is a slight underestimation of the values of the @xmath30 coefficients by the voronoi method ( see table  [ tab : cumulant ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , we do not see a possibility to correct for such effects .",
    "on the other hand , the delaunay method seems to be more robust against such effects .",
    "however , it tends to underestimate the value of the variance and the higher order moments .",
    "the latter is probably a consequence of the fact that the effective filtering radius tends to be larger .",
    "a major complication in the analysis of velocity fields under practical circumstances is the fact that only the velocity component along the line of sight can be measured .",
    "this therefore forms the second issue that we address in this paper .",
    "as yet we restrict ourselves to an artificial situation with ideal measurements , not yet to investigate the determination of the statistical quantities associated with the velocity field under realistic circumstances . to simplify furthermore our investigations",
    "we assume that we can use the approximation of an infinitely remote observer so that the radial velocity can be identified with one velocity component , namely the @xmath54-direction in the following .",
    "more specifically , we address the effects of the reduction of information concerning the velocity field traced by a diluted sample of points . in principle , the fact that the velocity field is only known along one direction should not pose any problem . in the usual structure formation scenarios based on gravitational instability the large scale velocity field",
    "is expected to be non - rotational , implying it to be a potential flow and therefore the gradient of a potential that can be inferred from the measurement of only one component of the velocity ( bertschinger et al .",
    "1990 , dekel et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "7.8 cm    11.5 cm    in the voronoi method non - zero values of the divergence @xmath11 are restricted to the walls of the voronoi tessellation , where the local divergence is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 being the normed vector orthogonal to the wall and @xmath57 the difference of the velocities on the opposite sides of the voronoi wall .",
    "the expression for the local vorticity is given by @xmath58 assuming potential flow , and hence a zero value of @xmath59 , this implies relations between the various components of @xmath57 and the following expressions for @xmath60 : @xmath61 in practice , this introduces the numerically unstable operation of dividing by one component @xmath56 as it can be arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "it may therefore be more reasonable to try to estimate the value of @xmath60 using the stable , but ad - hoc , prescription of @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a small parameter of the order of @xmath64 .",
    "note that such a prescription is not self - consistent in reproducing the full 3d velocity field . to a wall in the voronoi tessellation is proportional to the vector @xmath65 between the two points on each side of the wall .",
    "thus , if it were possible to build a consistent velocity filed from the constraints ( 17 ) it would imply @xmath66 yielding not only a vanishing vorticity but also a vanishing shear.]indeed , depending on the way one goes from cell a to cell b  and there are infinitely many ways to go from a to b , even while they are direct neighbours ",
    "one will not necessarily find the same value for @xmath67 using the equivalent prescriptions for @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "the method that we adopt here will therefore certainly not be the most accurate method .",
    "however , we may expect it to be a reasonable approximation , and will therefore use it here to illustrate the properties in which we are interested .",
    "figure  [ fig : pdf_1d ] displays the results obtained with ( [ eq : theta_w_estim ] ) for @xmath70 .",
    "evidently , the results get affected to quite some extent by the transition from ( [ eq : theta_w_exact ] ) to ( [ eq : theta_w_estim ] ) .",
    "this leads to the key question whether it is still feasible to reliably recover the statistical information on @xmath11 or not . as can be observed from the scatter plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatt_div ] , the change from a situation in which one has knowledge of the full velocity to one where this has been limited to only one component thereof introduces a large scatter .",
    "however , we found that it is possible to define a meaningful representation of the scatter plots in terms of the following empirical description : @xmath71 within this expression the coefficient @xmath72 is a constant with some fixed value .",
    "the scatter is represented by the quantity @xmath73 , a gaussian random variable whose value is _ independent _ of @xmath11 and which has a vanishing mean . using the measured values of the variance and the skewness of the distribution it is possible to estimate the value of @xmath72 and the value of the rms fluctuation @xmath74 of @xmath73 . from ( [ eq : theta_estim_model ] ) one can readily infer that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the exact rms fluctuations of @xmath11 and @xmath16 its third cumulant , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the corresponding estimated values .",
    "by solving this set of equations one can find the values of @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "their values for various @xmath0 and @xmath63 are listed in table  [ tab : par1d ] .",
    "moreover , significant within the context of the ultimate goal of developing an unbiased estimator of @xmath0 , is that these parameters were found to be almost independent of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically , it turns out that the value of @xmath72 only depends on the adopted value of @xmath63 , whereas @xmath74 is independent of @xmath0 and only marginally dependent on @xmath63 .",
    "this can clearly be appreciated from the bottom right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatt_div ] , which demonstrates that the two estimations of @xmath11 , one based on @xmath70 and the other on @xmath79 , are basically proportional to each other .",
    "it may therefore be argued that it is quite natural to expect that the noise @xmath73 introduced by this method is somehow intrinsic to the distribution .    in appendix",
    "b we describe an extremely simple model based on the assumption that the relative velocity of two particles is proportional to their relative position .",
    "this allows us to compute analytically the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath74 entailed by the use of the numerical scheme ( [ eq : theta_w_estim ] ) .",
    "one can show that they are both independent on @xmath0 , and only depend on @xmath63 and @xmath76 , with @xmath80 .",
    "these analytical predictions are listed in table  [ tab : par1d_anal ] .",
    "they appear to be fairly close to their numerical measurements .",
    "the discrepancy between the analytical and numerical estimations of these parameters is due to the loss of information associated with the projection of the velocity from three to one dimensions .",
    "although this is not fairly represented by our model , the discrepancy seems to be quite small .",
    ".numerical values of the parameters @xmath72 ( bias ) and @xmath74 ( noise ) introduced by the calculation ( [ eq : theta_w_estim ] ) of the velocity divergence . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     evidently , we are still able to clearly distinguish between the scenario with a high value of @xmath0 and the ones with a low value , although the distinction is not as clear as in the previous cases based on ideal sampling circumstances . looking into some detail , we come to the conclusion that the signal has been diluted somehow by the noise @xmath73 , and that there is a competition between the true rms of the divergence @xmath76 and the value of @xmath74 . in this respect",
    "it is also important to note that it is crucial for a successful determination of @xmath0 to have good estimates of both @xmath72 and @xmath74 .",
    "once these parameters have been determined , and as long as @xmath81 , we can see no further problem in distinguishing between the different cosmological scenarios .",
    "[ fig : pdf_1d ] gives an idea of the magnitude of the discrepancy that one gets when one assumes a wrong value of @xmath0 . in the left panel",
    "this concerns the case wherein one take a value of @xmath18 instead of the actual value of @xmath53 , while in the right - hand panel it concerns the reverse situation .    at this point",
    "it is worthwhile to stress once more that so far we only tested the method for _ ideal _ measurements of the line - of - sight velocities .",
    "noise in the measured values of these velocities was not yet taken into account . moreover , besides the fact that this noise has quite a large value , an evaluation of its influence is substantially complicated as it not only concerns random measurement errors but also contains contributions from a plethora of , partially un - understood , systematic effects . in a work in preparation we will attempt to develop specific techniques for estimating the velocity divergence pdf from such noisy line - of - sight measurements .",
    "we have tested and confirmed the validity of the strong @xmath0 dependence of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the velocity divergence that had been predicted on the basis of analytical perturbation theory calculations .",
    "these tests are based on a numerical analysis of n - body simulations of structure formation in a universe with a gaussian initial density and velocity fluctuation field . on the basis of this verification",
    "we may conclude that the analytical predictions of perturbation theory yield very accurate results for a wide range of cosmological models .",
    "the main practical implication of our work is the basis it offers for a potentially very valuable and promising estimator of the value of @xmath0 , an estimator independent of a possible bias between the distribution of galaxies and the underlying matter distribution .",
    "the successful tests presented in this work demonstrate the validity of the equations of perturbation theory that form a basis for the estimates of @xmath0 which are based on the statistical properties of the velocity divergence field .",
    "their unbiased nature finds its origin in the fact that the relations between the various statistical moments do not contain any explicit dependence on a bias between the galaxy and the matter distribution .",
    "moreover , the estimated values of @xmath0 are even more direct and straightforward to interpret as the relevant statistical relations only involve a very weak dependence on the cosmological constant @xmath24 is expected to be very weak ( bernardeau 1994a , b ) .",
    "not only relations between the statistical moments of the @xmath11 distribution , also the shape and general functional behaviour provide a useful indicator for the value of @xmath0 .",
    "when we focus on the details of this functional behaviour of the velocity divergence distribution function  illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_large_sample ] and [ fig : pdf_small_sample ] )  we can draw a few conclusions with regards the practical feasibility of obtaining reliable estimates from the shape of @xmath32 .",
    "both location and shape of the peak of this distribution appear to be robust indicators of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , the location of the maximum of the divergence @xmath11  i.e. the cutoff value of @xmath32  appears to be much more sensitive to a poor sampling .",
    "this may make it harder for it to provide reliable estimates of @xmath0 from currently available observational catalogues ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_small_sample ] ) .",
    "however , it is all the more encouraging that even on the basis of the cutoff value we obtained a reasonable agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical measurements .    finally , we addressed one further crucial issue towards an application of our estimation procedures to real data sets .",
    "this concerns the problem of not being able to obtain directly the full three - dimensional velocity field . instead",
    ", the velocity of a galaxy can only be measured along the line - of - sight . in a preliminary attempt to study the consequences of this fact for the feasibility of our method",
    ", we introduced a partially empirically defined extension of our method . despite of the extreme crudeness and rather ad - hoc nature of this algorithm to reconstruct the full velocity field ,",
    "it is quite encouraging that we are able to distinguish between the velocity pdf obtained in a flat universe and that obtained in an open universe .",
    "the major obstacle towards a successful application of our methods therefore appears to be the one of noisy data sets and systematic sampling errors .",
    "we have not yet dealt with these problems , deferring them to a forthcoming paper .",
    "an additional and useful application of our numerical work involves a test for structure indeed having emerged through the process of gravitational growth of an initially gaussian random density and velocity field . having shown perturbation theory to be valid , we can exploit its prediction that the pdf of @xmath11 is only dependent on a few parameters , in particular @xmath76 and @xmath0 .",
    "if no values of @xmath76 and @xmath0 can be found to produce an acceptable fit to the observed velocity field , this will force us to conclude that it is unlikely that the structure developed as described within the standard framework of gravitational instability and gaussian initial conditions . in this context",
    "it is interesting to point out that a negative skewness has been observed in the currently available datasets ( bernardeau et al .",
    "1995 ) , which is an indication in favour of standard scenarios .    summarizing",
    ", we may conclude that the combined machinery of the analytical perturbation theory results and the developed numerical methods and their application on the intrinsic statistical properties of the velocity field provides us with a reliable new estimator of the cosmological density parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this estimator is all the more useful as it is one of the very few which will yield values of @xmath0 completely independent of galaxy - density field biases and almost independent of the value of @xmath24 .",
