    "the nobel prize in physics awarded in 2015 to takaaki kajita and arthur mcdonald for studies of the atmospheric and solar neutrinos @xcite does not leave any doubt that neutrinos oscillate and have nonzero masses .",
    "the latter fact leads to the well - known possibility for neutrino to have non - trivial electromagnetic properties @xcite , which brought forth the research area that was investigated in details by numerous authors ( see recent review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in the course of these studies many phenomena that may appear in electromagnetic fields have been recognized and described thoroughly . among them",
    "the neutrino spin - flavor oscillations is the one , featuring both the above mentioned basic neutrino aspects  nonzero mass and electromagnetic properties from the one side and mixing from another @xcite . owing to this , in spite of being a longstanding problem",
    ", the spin - flavor oscillations can reveal some new aspects of existence of neutrino mass and electromagnetic properties .",
    "these concern the problems of neutrino parameters relation in neutrino physical ( mass ) and flavor bases and , generally speaking , of an accurate derivation of the formulas used to describe oscillations .",
    "we below give an advanced view on the standard scheme of neutrino spin - flavor oscillations description aiming at the solid determination of parameters involved in the formalism and its rigorous derivations .",
    "we consider neutrino mixing and oscillations in presence of an arbitrary constant magnetic field with nonzero transversal @xmath0 and longitudinal @xmath1 components with respect to the direction of neutrino propagation .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction of neutrinos is determined by neutrino diagonal and transition magnetic moments that are introduced for the neutrino mass states .",
    "explicit expressions for the effective neutrino diagonal and transition magnetic moments for the flavor bases in terms of these values for the mass states are obtained .",
    "the effective evolution hamiltonian for the flavor neutrino and the corresponding oscillation probability are derived .",
    "the role the longitudinal magnetic field component is examined . in particular",
    ", it is shown that : 1 ) @xmath1 coupled to the corresponding magnetic moments shifts the neutrino energy , and 2 ) in case of nonvanishing neutrino transition magnetic moments @xmath1 produces an additional mixing between neutrino states , both in the mass and flovour neutrino bases .",
    "consider two dirac neutrino physical states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 . also consider the neutrino electromagnetic interaction via magnetic moment matrix @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the dirac matrices . in a uniform magnetic field",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ em_hamilt ] ) becomes @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 are the pauli matrices .    for considering the neutrino evolution in the ultrarelativistic limit",
    "we introduce the 4-component basis @xmath15 of states with definite helicity @xmath16 . with the standard column vector notation",
    ", @xmath17 the neutrino evolution equation relevant to electromagnetic interaction has the schr@xmath18dinger - like form , @xmath19 the effective hamiltonian consists of the vacuum and interaction parts @xmath20 where the interaction part @xmath21 is composed of matrix elements of the interaction hamiltonian ( [ b_hamilt ] ) taken over the helicity neutrino states : @xmath22 .",
    "let us calculate the effective interaction hamiltonian under the assumption that neutrino moves along the @xmath23-axis . from the magnetic field interaction hamiltonian ( [ b_hamilt ] )",
    "we have : @xmath24 for the spinors representing the free neutrino states we take @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the neutrino @xmath27 momentum .",
    "the two - component spinors @xmath28 define neutrino helicity states , and are given by @xmath29 recall that in the ultrarelativistic limit these two states correspond to the right - handed @xmath30 and left - handed @xmath31 chiral neutrinos , respectively .",
    "substituting ( [ wave func ] ) into the effective hamiltonian given by ( [ hb ] ) , we get @xmath32 decomposing the magnetic field vector into longitudinal and transversal with respect to neutrino motion components @xmath33 it is possible to show that @xmath34 in the the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath35 one gets : @xmath36 where the quantity @xmath37 , fetched out also in @xcite , we call the transition gamma - factor . similarly , it is also possible to show that @xmath38    introducing an angle @xmath39 between the @xmath40 and @xmath26 vectors and assuming that @xmath41 is aligned along the @xmath42-axis , we further obtain that @xmath43 and , similarly , @xmath44",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 as it was expected , in neutrino transitions without change of helicity only the @xmath47 component of the magnetic field contributes to the effective potential , whereas in transitions with change of the neutrino helicity the transversal component @xmath48 matters .    performing the remaining simple algebra one can readily write out the @xmath21 matrix .",
    "thus , we obtain the evolution equation ( [ schred_eq ] ) in the following form @xmath49 this equation governs all possible oscillations of the four neutrino states with defined masses ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and helicities ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) in the presence of a magnetic field . the obtained expression ( [ gen_evol_eq ] ) for the evolution hamiltonian explicitly reveals a particular role of the longitudinal magnetic field component @xmath52 :    \\1 ) the longitudinal magnetic field component @xmath52 coupled to the corresponding magnetic moment shifts the neutrino energy ,    \\2 ) in case of nonvanishing neutrino transition magnetic moment @xmath53 , the presence of the longitudinal field @xmath52 produces mixing among neutrino species with different masses but with equal helicities .    at the same time , from ( [ gen_evol_eq ] ) it is clearly seen that mixings of different helicity neutrino states are due to the corresponding magnetic moment ( or transition magnetic moment ) interactions with the transversal magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "once having physics in the mass basis in hands , our next step is to bring it to observational terms .",
    "this means that we must elaborate a generalization of the mixing matrix for transitions between neutrino state vectors written in two four - component bases @xmath54 and @xmath55 so that @xmath56 this procedure appears to be not quite direct since we should hold the condition that polarization of the fields must be preserved under transformation of the bases elements .",
    "that is why , keeping in mind that chiral components are almost the helicity ones , we define @xmath57 then , using eqs .",
    "( [ u_def ] ) and ( [ transformations ] ) , it is easy to obtain that @xmath58    given the transition matrix ( [ u ] ) , derivation of the evolution equation in the flavor basis is straightforward : @xmath59 so that the effective magnetic field interaction hamiltonian @xmath60 has the following structure , @xmath61 here we have introduced the following formal notations intended to manifest an analogy with the standard spin - flavor oscillation formalism ( see below ) : @xmath62 @xmath63    the hamiltonian ( [ h_b_f ] ) has been derived within much consistent procedure than is usually given in literature . it should be noted that eqs .",
    "( [ mu_fl ] ) could be also obtained as results of general consideration @xcite of neutrino mixing and oscillations in an arbitrary constant magnetic field ( the final form like that of eqs .",
    "( [ mu_fl ] ) was not established in @xcite ) .",
    "also , an effective neutrino oscillation hamiltonian with terms containing quantities ( [ mu_gammas_fl ] ) , however without account for possibility of spin transitions , was obtained in @xcite .",
    "let us now confront the obtained effective magnetic field interaction hamiltonian ( [ h_b_f ] ) with the one typically written straight in the neutrino flavor basis ( see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the common neutrino gamma - factor .",
    "first of all , we can ascertain that the structure of the obtained expression ( [ h_b_f ] ) is consistent with the  standard \" hamiltonian ( [ h_b_f_old ] ) . at that , the magnitudes ( [ mu_fl ] ) account for the neutrino mixings and represent the straightforward expressions for the effective magnetic moments in the flavor basis in terms of magnetic moments introduced in the mass basis .",
    "the neutrino effective  magnetic moments \" ( [ mu_gammas_fl ] ) determine neutrino interactions and mixings due to the longitudinal magnetic field @xmath52 .    as in the mass basis , the magnetic field component @xmath52 shifts the neutrino energy",
    "also , it contributes to transitions with change of flavor .",
    "it is interesting to observe that when the transversal field component is set to zero the hamiltonian structure becomes @xmath66 so that neutrino states with different flavors and the same chirality decouple and form subsystems independently mixed by the field . for example , one would have two neutrino species @xmath67 and @xmath68 mixed in accordance with the equation ( here the standard terms for vacuum oscillations are added ) @xmath69 in this way , neutrino oscillations would be influenced by the longitudinal field @xmath52 ( see also @xcite ) and @xmath52 would produce an additional mixing with respect to the usual one described by the vacuum mixing angle @xmath70 .    the oscillation probability is just strightforward , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the denominator of the pre - sine factor and the other quantities have usual for the theory of neutrino oscillations meaning .",
    "it follows that in case the second term in the denominator is much smaller than the first one then the amplitude of the flavor oscillations @xmath73 gets its maximal value .",
    "this can be considered as an effect of neutrinos interaction with the longitudinal magnetic field due to neutrino magnetic moments .",
