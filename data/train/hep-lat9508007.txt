    "<S> we compute structure functions in the hamiltonian formalism on a momentum lattice using a physically motivated regularisation that links the maximal parton number to the lattice size . </S>",

    "<S> is observed in good agreement with lscher and weisz lattice results . </S>",
    "<S> we then compute distribution functions and find a @xmath1 behaviour and the typical peak at @xmath2 like in @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> hadron structure is probed by deep inelastic scattering ( @xmath4 ) . over recent years </S>",
    "<S> a great deal of experimental data has been gathered from high energy collider experiments . </S>",
    "<S> while perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( @xmath3 ) describes successfully the large @xmath1 dependence of @xmath4 structure functions , it fails to predict the correct dependence on the bjrken variable @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus much effort has been devoted to compute quark or gluon distribution functions and proton structure functions from @xmath3 with _ non - perturbative _ methods . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , martinelli et al.@xcite have computed the first two moments of the pion structure function via monte carlo lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are notoriously difficult ( for the present status of lattice calculations of structure functions see ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this situation calls for alternative techniques . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present such a new approach . </S>",
    "<S> its basic ingredients are : ( i ) we use a hamiltonian formulation , based on ( ii ) a momentum lattice as regulator , and ( iii ) use a breit frame ( _ not _ the rest frame ) corresponding to the scattering process . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our method to the scalar model in @xmath6 dimensions , which has been extensively studied , and compute the distribution function . as a result </S>",
    "<S> we find an altarelli - parisi like behaviour leading to a sharp forward peak at small @xmath5 at high resolution @xmath1 , as it typically shows up in high energy @xmath4 hadron scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we extract continuum physics : close to the critical point our results are in perfect agreement with the predicted scaling behaviour as well as with euclidian lattice results by lscher and weisz@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly outline the reasons for the choice of our method : ( i ) structure functions are computed from wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> wave functions are defined in minkowsky space where they can be computed directly from a hamiltonian formulation . </S>",
    "<S> the hamilonian approach offers the advantage of allowing to compute directly minkowsky space observables . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , scattering wave functions for glueball - like states in compact @xmath7 have been computed in a hamiltonian formulation on a momentum lattice@xcite ( for a review of hamiltonian lattice methods see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the usefulness of a momentum lattice to compute physics close to a critical point has been demonstrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the reason for our choice of the breit frame will be explained below . </S>",
    "<S> however , hamiltonian methods are known to lead to numerical problems because of the huge number of degrees of freedom involved . </S>",
    "<S> nobody has succeeded yet in observing scaling behaviour indicating continuum physics in a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hamiltonian formulation . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we shall demonstrate for the scalar theory that those difficulties can be overcome .    </S>",
    "<S> the most important experiment in order to probe the structure of hadrons is deep inelastic scattering ( @xmath4 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> its simplest form is inclusive scattering of an unpolarised lepton off a hadronic target . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall some basic notations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron in its ground state with four momentum @xmath8 interacts with the probing lepton by the exchange of a virtual photon ( our neutrino ) with space - like four - momentum @xmath9 . in feynman s parton model </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the proton consists of constituents , the partons , which are weakly bound , i.e. its binding energy is small compared to the resolution ability @xmath10 of the probing photon . in this approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the so - called bjrken scaling variable @xmath11 can be interpreted as the momentum fraction of the struck parton if we work in the breit frame . </S>",
    "<S> the breit frame is defined by the requirements that the photon energy @xmath12 be zero and that the photon momentum @xmath13 be antiparallel to the hadron momentum @xmath14 . in this frame </S>",
    "<S> the following relation between the parton momentum @xmath15 and the proton momentum holds : @xmath16 the rationale for this particular choice of frame being that @xmath3 structure functions @xmath17 can be interpreted as a linear combination of parton momentum distribution functions @xmath18 , which have a more intuitive interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is defined by th structure functions are another way of expressing scattering cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution function of a parton counts the number of those partons with a given momentum fraction @xmath5 in the proton . for a precise definition see ref.@xcite .    because the breit frame introduced above refers to a particular struck parton and we want to describe a many - parton system ( proton ) we need to extend the definition to a generalised breit frame : @xmath19 but @xmath13 needs no longer be antiparallel to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> although the parton momentum needs no longer be collinear in general to the proton momentum @xmath14 , we nevertheless impose eq.(1 ) as kinematical condition . </S>",
    "<S> while the generalised breit frame has been introduced for the purpose of practical calculations , it should be noted that the strict relation between distribution and structure functions , characteristic for original breit - frame no longer holds in a strict sense . </S>",
    "<S> however , this relation is recovered for the generalised breit frame in the continuum limit .    </S>",
    "<S> because we are working in the hamiltonian approach we need to define a basis of the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> we construct the hilbert space as a fock space of free particles and select ( parton ) momenta @xmath15 from a bounded domain corresponding to @xmath4 as given by eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an _ assumption _ based on the physical intuition that the experimentally observable parton momenta are those which dominate the quantum dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption has been tested by computing critical behaviour of renormalised masses and a good agreement with analytical scaling behaviour has been observed ( see below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now we introduce a momentum lattice regularisation : in order to have a practically convenient lattice we further constrain the parton momenta from eq.(1 ) , namely by selecting a regular cube centered at @xmath20 and located inside the ball given by eq.(1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the parton momenta @xmath15 lie in the domain @xmath21 we define lattice momenta @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an integer vector and @xmath24 is the momentum lattice spacing covering the domain given by eq.(2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one notices that all lattice momenta are @xmath25 ( non negative ) . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to a regularisation in the rest frame which does _ not _ limit the particle number , our approach has the following important property : for any given hilbert state with non - zero total momentum , the fock space particle numbers are bounded . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath26 given by eq.(2 ) implies a total particle number cutoff and thus drastically reduces the dimension of the hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * mass spectrum and critical behaviour of the @xmath27 theory * + before discussing structure functions we need to convince ourselves that the method allows to compute correctly physical observables . we have chosen the scalar @xmath27 theory because it is a quite well understood theory and has a second order phase transition , allowing to test our method near a critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the @xmath28 theory is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the bare mass and coupling constant , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we express the hamiltonian in terms of free field creation and annihilation operators corresponding to the lattice momenta . because the hamiltonian and the momentum operators commute , we compute the energy spectrum @xmath32 in a hilbert space sector of given momentum @xmath14 . since we are not in the rest frame we have to use the mass - shell condition @xmath33 in order to obtain the physical mass spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it is known@xcite that the critical line between the symmetric and the broken phase lies entirely in the region where the bare parton mass squared @xmath34 is negative . </S>",
    "<S> hence we can not build up the fock - space in terms of partons with those masses . as a remedy we have split the bare mass squared @xmath35 into a positive kinetic part @xmath36 and an interaction part @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> the fock states are built from positive bare masses @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the best choice of @xmath38 seems to be to take the renormalised mass @xmath39 ( which however , requires a separate calculation ) . in numerical calculations close to the critical point shown in fig.[1 ] </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen for simplicity a small positive value . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the lower lying physical mass spectrum is not very sensitive to the value of @xmath38 ( this is not the case for higher lying masses ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we diagonalised the hamiltonian on two lattices : @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this would correspond to symmetric lattices ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) of size @xmath44 and @xmath45 nodes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a very small hilbert space of only 6 and 21 states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in order to compare our results to those of lscher and weisz@xcite we express the bare parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in terms of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 : @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[1 ] displays the renormalised mass @xmath39 versus @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that our results computed on very small lattices are quite close to the results of lscher and weisz@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> masses @xmath50 computed on the lattice must obey @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the length of the lattice and @xmath53 denotes the lattice spacing of a space - time lattice @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown from perturbation theory@xcite that the physical masses close to the critical point obey the following scaling law @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> since the results of ref.@xcite are based on the solution of the renormalisation group equations , this scaling law fits their results . </S>",
    "<S> one should note , however , that two different regularisations ( this work and that of ref.@xcite ) in general correspond to two different critical lines . in tab . </S>",
    "<S> [ 1 ] we have displayed our results for the critical points @xmath58 as a function of @xmath46 and compared our results with those of ref.@xcite . again , our results are very close to those of lscher and weisz . </S>",
    "<S> these results cover a domain of the bare parameter space extending quite far away from the gaussian fixed point @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> another way to test continuum physics is to look at the mass ratios @xmath61 from the spectrum on the lattice and check if they become independent of the cutoff @xmath26 or else independent of the coupling constant @xmath62 ( i.e. , they scale ) . those mass ratios @xmath61 are shown in fig.[2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , for a number of states @xmath63 in a wide range of @xmath47-values , i.e. , they scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , for some states @xmath61 diverges , i.e. , there is no scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason behind this is the following : the @xmath27 model describes a gas of partons repelling each other@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of fig.[2 ] shows states dominated by the 1-,2-,3-,4- particle fock space sectors plus a spectrum of excited ( scattering ) states . </S>",
    "<S> the picture of repulsive two - particle - exchange force is confirmed by observation that the mass of the lowest - lying @xmath64-body state is larger than @xmath64-times the mass of the one - body state . </S>",
    "<S> the states which scale are just those lowest - lying @xmath64-body states . the higher - lying part of the spectrum consits of states with more nodes in the wave - function than lattice points , having also a wider range and contributions from higher fock - state sectors . </S>",
    "<S> because in the calculation corresponding to fig.[2 ] , the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath26 and the parton number cutoff are all kept fixed , we can not properly describe those higher - lying states . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , they do not show scaling . </S>",
    "<S> when we go to bigger lattices ( @xmath66 ) then we observe ( not displayed here ) more states which show scaling . </S>",
    "<S> +   + * distribution functions * + the distribution function @xmath18 of finding some parton with momentum fraction @xmath5 inside the hadron is determined by the parton momentum distribution function @xmath67 for finding a parton with momentum @xmath15 inside the hadron with momentum @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath68 is a dimensionful quantity , its scale is set by the lattice spacing @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath69 and thus depends on the bare parameters if one keeps the renormalised mass fixed . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum limit @xmath70 corresponds to the the limit towards arbitrarily high resolution ability . </S>",
    "<S> if one keeps the renormalised mass and the renormalised coupling constant fixed , then @xmath68 is a function of the bare coupling constant @xmath31 and vice versa  invertibility of @xmath71 assumed . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath18 is related via the function @xmath71 to the distribution function @xmath72 which only depends on dimensionless parameters . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , a calculation of the distribution function along a renormalisation group trajectory can be used to compute the @xmath68-dependence of the quark structure functions in @xmath3 .    while @xmath3 possesses bound states of quarks and gluons , the existence of corresponding bound states in the scalar @xmath0 is not evident . according to ref.@xcite they do not exist in the symmetric phase and there is little chance to find them in the broken phase , either . </S>",
    "<S> this is confirmed by our numerical findings . in order to compute distribution functions of a bound state of partons in the scalar model we have taken recurrence to the @xmath73 model . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the distribution function of the @xmath73 theory , because the @xmath73-interaction describes forces which are attractive one - particle exchange forces@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows formation of bound states as in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this theory is known to suffer from an unstable vacuum since it is unbounded from below . </S>",
    "<S> the unstable vacuum of the @xmath73 theory prevents to calculate meaningful ground state masses which are needed to specify renormalisation group trajectories and hence the exact relation between the resolution @xmath68 and the bare coupling constant @xmath31 . while in @xmath3 one computes @xmath74 and @xmath75 to obtain @xmath76 , here we can only compute the distribution function @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the distribution function in 1-,2- and 3 space dimensions . for a given parton number cutoff </S>",
    "<S> , these curves look very much alike . in order to analyse the behaviour at small @xmath5 we have chosen to present our result corresponding to a calculation in one space dimension ( fig.[3 ] ) . when increasing the coupling @xmath31 we see that the distibution function develops a peak at momentum fraction @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this is so , because increasing the coupling means that more partons are produced which share the total momentum fraction . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of the distribution function seen here is typical for @xmath3 , where @xmath75 increases with the resolution @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen in @xmath4 experiments and described by the altarelli - parisi equations . if we had applied a parton number cutoff independent of @xmath26 , the small @xmath5 behaviour of fig.[3 ] which is a typical many - body effect@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> would not have been seen . </S>",
    "<S> this is so because a system of @xmath64 identical observable particles must have an expectation value of @xmath5 around @xmath79 for symmetry reasons .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have devised a hamiltonian method able to compute physical observables in minkowsky space . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied it to the scalar model and obtained the correct scaling behaviour of the mass spectrum at the critical point . moreover , we have computed distribution functions showing a peak at small @xmath5 as described by the altarelli - parisi equations in @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> work is in progress to compute structure functions for full @xmath3 .    </S>",
