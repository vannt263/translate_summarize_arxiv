    "[ fig : radio ] we display the radio light curves at the frequencies of 1.43 , 4.86 and 8.46 ghz .",
    "the 8.46 ghz light curve has a well - defined peak above 1 mjy between 5 and 12 days after the burst , followed by a power - law decay . as noted previously by berger   ( 2001 ) , the flux density at centimeter wavelengths undergoes a flattening about 1 year after the burst which is attributed to synchrotron emission from an underlying host galaxy . after subtracting this component ( f@xmath27=39 @xmath28jy ) from the 8.46 ghz light curve",
    "we derive a temporal decay index @xmath29 ( where f@xmath30 ) between 12 and 1000 days after the burst .",
    "the 4.86-ghz light curve shows a similar rise and a decay as that at 8.46 ghz .",
    "however , superimposed on this long - term secular behavior there are significant changes in the flux density from one point to the next .",
    "these erratic fluctuations are not confined to day - to - day variations but there is also evidence for short - term variability ( 50% ) on timescales of a few hours . narrow - band , short - timescale flux variations are a hallmark of interstellar scattering ( iss ) @xcite .",
    "although we make rough approximations for the iss - induced fluctuations in  [ sec : bbmodel ] , a more detailed treatment of iss for  is postponed for a later paper .",
    "in contrast to the flux variations seen at 8.46 ghz and 4.86-ghz , the 1.43 ghz light curve is notable for its relative constancy .",
    "most of the emission at this frequency is dominated by the host galaxy with f@xmath3168 @xmath28jy ( berger et al .",
    "2001 ) . after allowing for some variation due to iss , the peak flux of 0.15 mjy reached @xmath550 days after the burst is well below the peak at 8.46 ghz ( @xmath51 mjy ) and at 4.86 ghz ( @xmath50.3 mjy ) .",
    "this apparent drop in the peak flux density with decreasing frequency (  `` peak flux cascade '' ) has been noted for other well - studied bursts ( frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 , yost et al .",
    "2002 ) and poses an important constraint on possible models ( see  [ sec : bbmodel ] ) .    the optical / nir data shown in fig .  [ fig : optical ] exhibits the familiar power - law decay of the afterglow",
    ".  occurred in a bright grb host galaxy @xcite and so the optical / nir afterglow could only be followed for a few days before the host dominated the light curve .",
    "the b , v , r , i , j , h , and k band light curves can be characterized by a power - law afterglow component ( in time and frequency ) plus a frequency - dependent host component .",
    "there is also a small excess in the flux density between the r and k bands near day 20 .",
    "as noted by holland et al .",
    "2001 , this could be due to a supernova component in the late - time light curve but its significance is not strong enough to warrant its inclusion in the fitting .    a noise - weighted least squares fit of the form f@xmath32=",
    "f@xmath33 + f@xmath34 was carried out on the entire optical / nir data and yielded @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37=64.7/66 .",
    "the steep spectral slope @xmath38 relative to the x - ray ( @xmath39 ) has been noted before and attributed to dust extinction from the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "our more accurate value of @xmath40 is consistent with earlier derivations @xcite , but it is considerably steeper than the radio ( @xmath41 ) and x - ray ( @xmath42 ) light curves in figs .  [ fig : radio ] and [ fig : xray ] .",
    "we interpret the observations summarized in  [ sec : obs ] and  [ sec : bbdata ] within the framework of the standard relativistic blast wave model ( see mszros 2002 for a review ) . in this model",
    "an impulsive release of energy from the grb event drives an ultra - relativistic outflow into the surrounding medium .",
    "particle acceleration occurring within this forward - propagating shock produces the afterglow emission via synchrotron and/or the inverse compton processes . since the evolution of the blast wave is sensitive to the energy and geometry of the explosion , as well as the density structure of the circumburst medium , the modeling of the afterglow emission can be used , in principle , to extract valuable information on grb progenitors and their environments , as well as details on the microphysics of the shock ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2001a ) .",
    "the particular approach we have taken to model broadband afterglow emission has been described in some detail in two recent papers @xcite . in brief",
    ", we characterize the broadband spectrum by several break frequencies , including both synchrotron and inverse compton components , one of which usually dominates depending on the circumstances .",
    "the microphysics of the shock , such as the electron energy index , @xmath43 , the fraction of shock energy in electrons @xmath44 , and the fraction of shock energy in magnetic field @xmath45 are taken to be invariant with time .",
    "the temporal evolution of the break frequencies is governed by the energy of the shock ( which can be radiative ) , the geometry of the shock ( which can be isotropic or jet - like ) , and the density structure of the surrounding medium ( which can be constant or vary as the inverse square of the radius ) .",
    "in addition to the basic physics , the model also accounts for several complicating effects such as iss at radio wavelengths , dust extinction in the optical / nir bands , and a possible pan - chromatic contribution to the emission from a host galaxy .",
    "the solution which best describes all the afterglow data for  is a collimated outflow expanding into a constant density medium . under the heading `` ism '' table  [ tab : model ]",
    "summarizes the best - fit parameters which were derived using a least - squares approach .",
    "in addition to the shock parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , the model solves for the jet opening angle @xmath46 , the circumburst density @xmath47 , the isotropic - equivalent fireball energy at the time when the fireball evolution becomes largely adiabatic @xmath48 , the restframe extinction a(v ) , and the host flux density at several wavelengths .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of this model is that it requires a jet break at @xmath49 days after the burst .",
    "the expected steepening of the optical / nir lightcurves at @xmath50 is not obvious because of the brightness of the host galaxy .",
    "although the steep value of @xmath40 relative to @xmath51 and @xmath52 is suggestive ( see  [ sec : bbdata ] and holland et al .",
    "2001 ) , the case for a jet in  is based primarily on the peak flux cascade observed at radio wavelengths ( see  [ sec : bbdata ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] ) .",
    "it is this same behavior that makes it impossible to model the afterglow of  as an adiabatic expansion of an isotropic shock . in general , since radio afterglows exhibit a different observational signature than either that of optical or x - ray afterglows , they have proven useful in revealing other cases of `` hidden jets '' @xcite .",
    "now that the true geometry is known ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath53 ) , the energy released in the grb phase @xmath54 and the afterglow phase @xmath55 can be determined and compared .",
    "for a two - sided jet , these isotropic values are reduced by the factor @xmath56/2 .",
    "thus , the geometry - corrected gamma - ray energy @xmath57  erg and the kinetic energy in the blastwave @xmath58  erg .",
    "the value of @xmath59 differs from the compilation of frail et al .",
    "( 2001 ) because here we have used the circumburst density derived from the broadband modeling rather than some assumed value .",
    "note also that @xmath60 is only a lower limit on the true initial energy of the blastwave since @xmath61 ) is derived at a time @xmath62=1.4 days . after this time",
    "the blast - wave evolution is predominantly adiabatic and the energy dissipation is less than a factor of two up to 100 days after the burst .",
    "we estimate that prior to this time ( when radiative losses decrease the blastwave energy ) the energy drops by about a factor of three . another important quantity that can be estimated is @xmath63 , the efficiency of the fireball in converting the energy in the ejecta into @xmath0 rays . a number of recent papers ( beloborodov 2000 ; guetta , spada & waxman 2001 , kobayashi & sari 2001 ) have argued that internal shocks under certain conditions are very efficient at producing gamma - rays ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath64 ) . from @xmath60 and @xmath59",
    "we derive @xmath65/(@xmath60+@xmath59 ) between 15% and 35% , comparable to previous estimates of this and other well - studied events ( _ e.g. , _ panaitescu & kumar 2001a ) .    while this ism model provides satisfactory agreement with the broadband dataset (  [ sec : bbdata ] ) , it is not a unique solution .",
    "an explosion into a wind - blown circumburst medium @xcite also yields an equally good fit ( see table  [ tab : model ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : wradio]-[fig : wxray ] ) .",
    "the ejecta are also collimated in this model with @xmath66 .",
    "the density is parameterized by @xmath67 which characterizes the wind density , with @xmath68 g @xmath3 , with @xmath69 the wind radius in cm .",
    "the most troubling feature of this model is that it requires about 70% of the shock energy going into the electrons .",
    "likewise , the geometry - corrected gamma - ray energy of @xmath70  erg is a factor of 10 _ larger _ than the kinetic energy in the blastwave @xmath60 .",
    "this suggests an unusually high @xmath71 , which , as noted above , is contrary to theoretical expectations since little of the initial shock energy in the fireball is left to power the afterglow .",
    "thus , while a wind - blown solution formally fits the data and can not be ruled out , we prefer the ism model since it does not require such extreme physical conditions .    regardless of which afterglow model is preferred , the host magnitudes are comparable to those derived by sokolov et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and berger et al .",
    "( 2002 ) at optical and radio wavelengths , respectively .",
    "likewise , the steep spectral slope @xmath38 ( see  [ sec : bbdata ] ) requires modest rest frame v - band extinction a(v)@xmath51 , in accordance with earlier estimates @xcite .",
    "there have been several attempts to derive the fireball parameters for  by constructing single - epoch spectra from the early afterglow data ( bloom et al .  1998 ; castro - tirado et al .  1999 ; vreeswijk et al .",
    "the estimates for these parameters have varied widely among these papers , due to slightly different data sets and a high degree of correlation between the parameters .",
    "for example , there is a degeneracy between the electron energy index @xmath43 , the extinction a(v ) , and the host brightness that makes it difficult to extract the underlying spectral slope of the afterglow and therefore the location of two important break frequencies @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this leads to large uncertainties in the parameters e@xmath74 , n , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the limitations of this spectral snapshot method can be overcome by globally fitting all the afterglow data using a hydrodynamical model of the blast wave .",
    "this is the approach that we have adopted in this paper but the first application of this method to  was made by panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) .",
    "their basic model is similar to our own .",
    "they find that a collimated outflow in a constant density medium provides a good description of the data , and they also find acceptable fits to stellar wind model . however , the differences between our models show up most clearly in the derived fireball parameters with e@xmath75 erg , n@xmath76 @xmath3 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 rad .",
    "radiative losses are small in their model and inverse compton ( ic ) emission is negligible , while @xmath44=0.27 in our model and ic is important for flattening the x - ray light curve around day 1 . the most severe difference , however , is that the density derived by panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) is 3.5@xmath81 times smaller than our estimate in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is not likely the result of differences in the implementation of the relativistic blast wave model .",
    "although our specific methodology does differ somewhat , in at least one case when fits were made using the _ same _ data for grb000926 , the results were in good agreement @xcite .",
    "the most serious limitation of the panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) analysis of this burst is that it relies on data taken over a limited frequency range and a limited temporal range .",
    "the optical data were restricted effectively to 1 to 5 days due to host galaxy contamination , and the early radio data ( especially at 5 ghz ) were of limited use due to iss . with the addition of a complete set of centimeter radio light curves for   much of this difficulty can be resolved .",
    "the most significant area of improvement is in the determination of the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath82 .",
    "this important break frequency is largely unconstrained in the panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) model and is likely the origin of our discrepant density estimates .",
    "an alternate way to view the difficulties in the afterglow model of panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) is to use the `` c parameter '' , introduced by sari & esin ( 2001 ) , which places a constraint on the combination of synchrotron break frequencies and the peak flux density . from fig . 1 of panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) we find the following values for the synchrotron parameters : @xmath83 hz , @xmath84 hz , and @xmath85mjy .",
    "in order not to violate the theoretial limit of @xmath86 it requires a self - absorption break @xmath87 ghz . it is this upper limit on @xmath82 which leads to the low value of n@xmath76 @xmath3 . a broadband spectrum of the  afterglow on day 4.5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] ) shows this to be a significant underestimate of @xmath82 .",
    "if we use a more appropriate value of @xmath82=14 ghz at this time than the additional synchrotron parameters of panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) give an unphysical solution with c@xmath881 unless the cooling frequency @xmath73 is significantly reduced and an ic component is added .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the density of the circumburst medium .",
    "a high - quality panchromatic dataset , resulting from a multi - wavelength observing campaign of , has enabled us to apply the relativistic blast wave model in order to determine the geometry and energetics of the explosion , the density of the medium immediately surrounding the progenitor , as well as the properties of the interstellar medium within the host galaxy .",
    "all of the afterglow data for  are consistent with a model in which the ejecta are collimated and expanding into a constant density medium .",
    "although it is not a unique solution , it yields reasonable estimates for the physical parameters which are in agreement with other well - studied events .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result from this work is what has been learned about the properties of grb environment .",
    "a proper understanding of the density structure of the circumburst medium remains an important goal , since it is invariably tied to the grb progenitor question . to the degree that the underlying assumptions behind the fireball model of grb afterglows are correct",
    ", broadband modeling gives us the only _ direct _ determination of this density .",
    "optical extinction , host galaxy properties , x - ray lines , late - time optical bumps , or the attenuation of low energy x - ray photons are all _ indirect _ or line - of - sight measures of the grb environment . in a recent compilation of 10 well - studied afterglows ,",
    "panaitescu & kumar ( 2002 ) showed that broadband modeling yielded densities in the range of 0.1 - 100 @xmath3 .",
    "their result is in good accord with our own extensive modeling of afterglows ( _ e.g. , _",
    "frail , waxman & kulkarni 2000 , berger et al .",

    "2001 , harrison et al .  2001 ,",
    "yost et al .",
    "2002 ) .    for two events , grb and , panaitescu & kumar ( 2001b ) the derived densities ( _ i.e. , _ n@xmath89 @xmath3 ) are much lower than the values given above .",
    "these low estimates prompted the suggestion that some grbs are massive stars which explode in the pre - existing cavities of superbubbles created by a previous generation of supernovae @xcite .",
    "the circumburst density for  derived from our model , n@xmath9028 @xmath3 , is much higher because the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath91 was not well constrained by the early observations . on the timescale of interest ,",
    "@xmath91 lies within the radio band and is a sensitive indicator of the ambient density , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath92",
    ". a similar problem likely explains results from grb but it is further complicated by the evidence that the early radio emission was dominated by a reverse shock component ( kulkarni et al .",
    "likewise , it can be shown that the claims of high circumburst densities ( _ i.e. , _",
    "n@xmath93 @xmath3 ) based solely on x - ray and optical observations ( piro et al .",
    "2001 ; int zand et al .",
    "2001 ) can not be supported once radio data is included ( harrison et al .",
    "thus radio observations , which help to constrain the low energy part of the synchrotron spectrum , are essential for deriving accurate physical parameters of the blast wave .    in summary , for all well - studied grb afterglows to date",
    "there is little evidence for either extreme of high n@xmath94 @xmath3 or low n@xmath95 @xmath3 circumburst densities . instead ,  is the latest of a growing number of events whose density lies within a narrow range of 0.1 - 100 @xmath3 with a canonical value of order n@xmath510 @xmath3 .",
    "such densities are found in diffuse interstellar clouds of our galaxy , commonly associated with star - forming regions . a density of order 5 - 30 @xmath3 is also characteristic of the interclump medium of molecular clouds , as inferred from observations of supernova remnants in our galaxy ( _ e.g. , _",
