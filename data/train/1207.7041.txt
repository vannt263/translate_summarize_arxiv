    "as einstein s theory of general relativity is approaching its centennial celebration , the problem of understanding the orbital trajectories of a particle around a very massive object still retains great interest .",
    "although current research has focused on the properties of spinning black holes and on the effects of gravitational waves , the original analytic solutions for the schwarzschild metric are still used for the study of astronomical objects for which the assumption of static spherical symmetry is reasonable .",
    "the orbital solutions to the schwarzschild metric also provide useful guides from which various perturbation methods originate .",
    "although the orbital problem for the schwarzschild metric has been solved in terms of the equations for the orbits , a complete picture of the solution space in terms of a single clear map has been lacking .",
    "given , say , the trajectory of a particle around some star or black hole , one would be interested in the characterizing parameters of such a trajectory and how it relates to other possible trajectories .",
    "indeed , the question of constructing a universal map and what physical parameters should be used for the coordinates ( the `` latitude '' and `` longitude '' ) of such a map did not seem to have been seriously considered before our recent work [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "it is well known [ see e.g. ref.5 ] , for example , that the discriminant of a relevant cubic equation is used to establish the criteria for distinguishing different types of possible orbits in the schwarzschild metric .",
    "however , because of the absence of a universal map , clear boundary curves that separate different regions of the parameter space for different types of orbits and trajectories were never clearly presented before our work in ref.4 .",
    "the most widely used analytic solutions and analyses for orbits and trajectories in the schwarzschild metric were based on chandrasekhar s work [ 5 ] that originated with darwin [ 6 ] .",
    "we shall make a comparison of our analysis with theirs at the end of this paper .",
    "two notable features of chandrasekhar s analysis are that ( i ) his analytic solutions for the orbits are implicit , not explicit , expressions that include a parameter that is related to the polar angle in a somewhat complicated implicit way , and ( ii ) one of his two parameters for characterizing the orbital trajectories can be real or purely imaginary , making the regions for different types of trajectories difficult to be placed on a map . among the earlier work , we should mention the publications of forsyth [ 7 ] and whittaker [ 8 ] who gave some special cases of the analytic solutions for the orbits that we present here ( and in refs .",
    "[ 1 - 4 ] ) but in different forms .",
    "hagihara [ 9 ] had a detailed analysis of all possible orbits in terms of weierstrassian elliptic functions but his analysis involved some lengthy algebraic expressions and his division of all possible orbits into seventeen cases also unnecessarily complicates the picture .",
    "but he did present a map with two dimensionless parameters as coordinates [ 9 , fig.13 ] even though he failed to clearly identify the physical significance of the two parameters , and he classified the orbits largely according to the roots of the relevant cubic equations .",
    "two important conclusions to be drawn from our derivation of analytic solutions for the orbits and trajectories in terms of the jacobian elliptic functions are the following : ( a ) the consequence of having an analytic solution for the orbits is not just that it is exact and convenient , as a numerical solution of the differential equation could easily produce the same precise trajectory .",
    "the more important consequence is that it cleverly picks out the appropriate characterizing dimensionless parameters for the orbits and these parameters are dimensionless in terms of some combinations of physical quantities that could not have been easily guessed otherwise ; and ( b ) the well - studied jacobian elliptic functions allow many simple relations among different parameters for a number of special cases that are very useful for checking numerical computations .",
    "it is with these considerations in mind that we present the characterization of all possible orbits and trajectories on a map with the special choice of two dimensionless physical parameters as the coordinate axes .    in this paper , we summarize and extend the most essential features and expressions of our previous analysis and present them in a complete picture .",
    "we describe three pairs of dimensionless parameters that can be used for the coordinates of the map of all possible orbits and trajectories , each of which exhibits some special advantages . among the useful outcomes are the following : ( 1 ) all possible orbital trajectories of a particle in the schwarzschild metric",
    "are placed on a universal map ; ( 2 ) the boundary between the two regions that separate different types of trajectories is clearly shown on the map ; ( 3 ) one particular set of parameters serves to illuminate some interesting properties with regard to the meaning and existence of newtonian limiting orbits .",
    "we also present an abundance of simple analytic results and relations for some special cases in various parts of the map that are useful for many purposes , not the least of which is to provide a way to check results from numerical computations .",
    "here is a brief outline of this paper . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the fundamental differential equations in the schwarzschild geometry and three possible pairs of characterizing parameters . in section 3 ,",
    "we present three explicit analytic solutions for all possible orbital trajectories of a particle in the schwarzschild metric , define two regions and give examples of orbital trajectories in the two regions .",
    "while these three fundamental solutions for the orbits may have been given in different forms by other authors , we have explicit analytic expressions for many related relevant physical quantities , especially those for orbits of the hyperbolic type , that were not given by other authors .",
    "one of these expressions ( for the impact parameter of a particle ) corrects an erroneous expression given by chandrasekhar [ 5 ] . in section 4",
    "we describe the boundaries of the two regions in the forms of curves expressed by simple equations . in section 5",
    ", we present analytic expressions for the orbital trajectories on these boundaries and provide examples . in section 6",
    ", we present a clear picture of how the orbital trajectories change across the boundaries of the two regions . in section 7",
    ", we introduce a large collection of analytic relations that relate various physical parameters at various special locations on our map .",
    "these have been very useful for checking our numerical calculations and can be useful for checking other numerical computations",
    ". however , this section could be skipped on a first reading . in section 8",
    ", we present the newtonian and non - newtonian correspondences of our general relativistic results and show a sector of a region on our map in which there exist elliptical orbits that have properties which have not seemed to have been previously recognized .",
    "we also derive an approximate formula for the general relativistic correction to a newtonian hyperbolic orbit .",
    "our calculation gives a slightly different result from that given by other authors for a proposed experiment involving a spaceship that can be carried out in our solar system . in section 9",
    ", we relate the parameters that we use in our analysis with those used by chandrasekhar [ 5 ] .",
    "this comparison can be used for reference by those readers who are familiar with chandrasekhar s work . in section 10 ,",
    "we summarize the principal results of this paper .",
    "we consider the schwarzschild geometry , i.e. the static spherically symmetric gravitational field in the empty space surrounding some massive spherical object such as a star or a black hole of mass @xmath0 .",
    "the schwarzschild metric for the empty spacetime outside a spherical body in the spherical coordinates @xmath1 is [ 10 ] @xmath2    where @xmath3    is the schwarzschild radius , @xmath4 is the universal gravitation constant , and @xmath5 is the speed of light . if @xmath6=(t , r,\\theta,\\phi)$ ] , then the worldline @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the proper time along the path , of a particle moving in the equatorial plane @xmath9 , satisfies the equations [ 10 ] @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12    where the derivative @xmath13 represents @xmath14 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath15 and @xmath16 describe the position of the particle relative to the star or black hole situated at the origin .",
    "the constant @xmath17 is identified as the angular momentum per unit rest mass of the particle , and the constant @xmath18 is identified to be the total energy per unit rest energy of the particle @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the total energy of the particle in its orbit and @xmath21 is the rest mass of the particle at @xmath22 . substituting eqs.(3 ) and ( 5 ) into ( 4 ) gives the combined energy equation @xmath23    substituting @xmath24 into the combined energy equation gives the differential equation for the orbit of the planet @xmath25    where @xmath26 .",
    "we define the dimensionless distance @xmath27 of the particle from the star or black hole , measured in units of the schwarzschild radius , by @xmath28    in terms of @xmath29 , eq.(8 ) becomes @xmath30    where @xmath31    by changing the variable from @xmath29 to another dimensionless quantity @xmath32 defined by @xmath33    or @xmath34",
    "eq.(10 ) becomes @xmath35    where @xmath36    and where we have defined the dimensionless quantity @xmath37 given by @xmath38    it is clear that as soon as we use the dimensionless distance @xmath27 ( and the dimensionless angle @xmath16 ) to express the differential equation ( 8) in the form of eq.(10 ) or ( 13 ) , the solutions for the orbits should be conveniently characterized by a pair of dimensionless parameters @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are called the invariants of the weierstrassian elliptic functions [ 11 ] that would represent the solution for @xmath32 for the differential equation ( 13 ) .",
    "notice that while the constant of motion @xmath18 defined by eq.(6 ) , which is the total energy per unit rest energy , can obviously be one of the dimensionless parameters , the other constant of motion @xmath17 which is the angular momentum per unit rest mass is not a dimensionless quantity and should not be used by itself as a parameter for representing the orbits in a universal map . that @xmath43 defined by eq.(11 ) could be used as the second characterizing parameter was recognized by one of us in ref.[1 ] .",
    "in fact , the orbit solutions depend on @xmath44 and @xmath45 as shown by eqs.(10 ) , ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) . while we shall briefly discuss the parameter spaces described by the coordinates @xmath39 and @xmath40 , for most of this paper we shall use the parameter space characterized by the coordinates @xmath46 . the principal reason for this choice of parameters",
    "is that the parameter @xmath47 conveniently reduces to the well known parameter called eccentricity for the classical newtonian case . in our earlier work [ 1,2 ]",
    ", there was an oversight on our part in which we unnecessarily limited ourselves to the case @xmath48 , but we remedied it in ref.4 .",
    "we call the two dimensionless parameters @xmath37 and @xmath45 defined by eqs.(15 ) and ( 11 ) the energy eccentricity and gravitational field parameters , or simply the energy and field parameters , respectively .",
    "they are the principal parameters we use as coordinates for characterizing the orbital trajectories of a particle in the gravitational field produced by the massive object or black hole of mass @xmath0 .",
    "we use the parameter space @xmath46 , and @xmath49 as well , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 for classifying and identifying all possible types of orbital trajectories . in doing so",
    ", we shall put all possible trajectories in the schwarzschild metric on a two - dimensional universal map on which the two coordinate axes are real and represent dimensionless physical quantities . for @xmath48",
    ", the three cases of @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be used to classify the orbits as elliptic - type , parabolic - type and hyperbolic - type , similar to those in the newtonian cases ; for @xmath55 on the other hand , the orbits do not have any newtonian correspondences and this will be explained and discussed in section 8 .",
    "we consider eq.(13 ) and derive its analytic solutions in this section .",
    "the discriminant @xmath56 of the cubic equation @xmath57    is defined by @xmath58    for the case @xmath59 , the three roots of the cubic equation ( 16 ) are all real .",
    "we call the three roots @xmath60 and arrange them so that @xmath61 ; the special cases when two or three of the roots are equal will be considered also . for the case",
    "@xmath62 , the cubic equation ( 16 ) has one real root and two roots that are complex conjugates .",
    "the analytic solutions of eq.(13 ) that we present below will give the distance @xmath15 of the particle from the star or black hole in terms of the jacobian elliptic functions [ 11 ] that have the polar angle @xmath16 in their argument and that are associated with a modulus @xmath63 that will be defined .",
    "there are three relevant analytic solutions of eq.(13 ) .",
    "the first two solutions are for the case @xmath59 , and  the third solution is for the case @xmath62 .",
    "the region that contains all the coordinate points @xmath46 for the first two solutions for the case @xmath59 is called region i ( see [ fig.1 ] ) , and the region that contains all the coordinate points @xmath46 for the third solution for the case @xmath62 is called region ii .",
    "there are two physically inadmissible regions : the region below the horizontal axis @xmath64 and the region corresponding to @xmath65 which is the region ( called region ii in fig.1 ) above the curve @xmath66 where @xmath67 will be given in the next section .",
    "the boundary between regions i and ii consists of two segments that we call @xmath68 ( the upper boundary of region i ) and @xmath69 ( the left boundary of region i ) that will be defined in the next section .",
    "the three boundary curves @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 all satisfy @xmath71 .",
    "we now present the three relevant analytic solutions of eq.(13 ) .",
    "solution ( a1 ) for @xmath59 , @xmath72 ( applicable in region i ) .",
    "writing the right - hand side of eq.(13 ) as @xmath73 , the equation for the orbit is @xmath74    for the case @xmath75 , the initial point at @xmath76 gives @xmath77 ( i.e. @xmath78 ) and thus @xmath79 from eq.(13 ) which means that the particle at this point is in the direction perpendicular to the radius vector . for the case",

    "we shall have more to say about this point in section 9 .",
    "the precessional angle @xmath132 is given by @xmath133    whether the orbit is closed ( and hence periodic ) or non - closed ( and hence non - periodic ) depends on whether @xmath134 is or is not a rational number .",

    "in contrast to the analyses of other authors that used various mathematical inequalities for separating and discussing the different regions , region i is explicitly shown ( in [ fig.1 ] ) to be bounded on the left by @xmath186 given by eq.(48 ) that is obtained from setting @xmath71 and @xmath86 [ see eqs.(20 ) and ( 42 ) ] , and it is bounded on the top by @xmath216 given by eq.(50 ) that is obtained from setting @xmath71 and @xmath90 , and region ii is bounded on the top for @xmath75 by @xmath217 given by eq.(52 ) .",
    "the use of @xmath37 and @xmath45 for characterizing an orbit is seen to arise naturally from eq.(10 ) or ( 13 ) , and the advantage of this characterization is enhanced by the fact that the non - terminating orbits inside region i ( excluding its boundaries ) can be conveniently classified into three types : the elliptic - type for @xmath320 ( [ fig.3 ] ) , the parabolic - type for @xmath113 ( [ fig.4 ] ) , and the hyperbolic - type for @xmath80 ( [ fig.5 ] ) . with the star or black hole at the origin , the elliptic - type orbit is a bound precessing elliptic orbit with the precessional angle @xmath132 given by eq.(27 ) and with @xmath117 and @xmath119 given by eqs.(23 ) and ( 24 ) .",
    "the parabolic - type orbit is an unbound orbit in which a particle approaches from infinity at @xmath76 and can , in general , go around the star or black hole a number of times as its polar angle increases from @xmath100 to @xmath140 before going off to infinity .",
    "the hyperbolic - type orbit is also an unbound orbit in which a particle approaches from infinity along an incoming asymptote at an angle @xmath144 given by eq.(29 ) to the horizontal axis , turning counter - clockwise about the star to its right on the horizontal axis , and leaving along an outgoing asymptote at an angle @xmath150 given by eq.(30 ) .",

    "i , a particle initially at a distance @xmath169 given by eq.(36 ) from the black hole at @xmath76 plunges into the center of the black hole when the polar angle @xmath668 given by eq.(37 ) , and @xmath169 is finite for all values of @xmath37 ( [ fig.6 ] , [ fig.7 ] and [ fig.8 ] ) .",
    "region ii allows only terminating orbits .",
    "the initial distance @xmath197 of the particle from the black hole is finite and is given by eq.(44 ) for @xmath669 ( [ fig.9 ] and [ fig.12 ] ) , it is infinite at @xmath76 for @xmath113 ( [ fig.10 ] ) , and it is infinite at @xmath670 given by eq.(46 ) for @xmath80 ( [ fig.11 ] ) .",
    "the particle plunges into the center of the black hole when its polar angle @xmath200 given by eq.(45 ) .",
    "two types of orbits occur on the boundary @xmath104 : stable circular orbits of radii @xmath302 given by eq.(57 ) and terminating orbits given by eq.(67 ) .",
    "two types of orbits occur on the boundary @xmath105 :  unstable circular orbits of radii @xmath336 given by eq.(69 ) , and asymptotic orbits given by eq.(62 ) with the particle starting from @xmath360 for @xmath320 ( [ fig.15 ] ) , or with the particle starting from infinity at the polar angle @xmath143 given by eq.(66 ) for @xmath176 ( [ fig.16 ] and [ fig.17 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic orbits end up circling the star or black hole with a radius that asymptotically approaches @xmath119 given by eq.(65 ) .",
    "as the boundary @xmath105 is crossed from region i to region ii , the non - terminating orbit of region i becomes an asymptotic orbit on @xmath105 and then becomes the terminating orbit of region ii , while the terminating orbit of region i becomes an unstable circular orbit on @xmath105 and becomes part of the terminating orbit in region ii . on the other hand , as the boundary @xmath104",
    "is crossed from region ii to region i , the terminating orbit of region ii becomes a terminating orbit on @xmath104 and then becomes the terminating orbit of region i , while a stable circular orbit becomes possible on @xmath104 and then becomes an elliptical orbit in region i. these transitions are illustrated by pictures of the corresponding changes in the `` effective potential '' curve @xmath351 ( [ fig.18]-[fig.23 ] ) .",
    "all these observations could not have been so clearly presented without the help of the two curves that clearly mark the boundaries @xmath104 and @xmath105 between regions i and ii on a universal map ( [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "we consider the presentation of all these clearly identifiable transitions of orbits from region i to region ii to be one of the distinctive results of this paper .",
    "the use of @xmath37 for characterizing the orbits is also related to the fact that in the weak field limit and for @xmath48 , @xmath47 becomes the newtonian eccentricity @xmath495 that describes the classical newtonian orbit given by eq.(110 ) or ( 121 ) , as can be seen from eqs.(107)-(109 ) and ( 112 ) .",
    "thus the usual division of the newtonian orbit into elliptic for @xmath499 , parabolic for @xmath500 , and hyperbolic for @xmath501 is seen to be a special case of the division for the general relativistic non - terminating orbits in region i. we showed that in region i close to @xmath104 , there exist elliptic orbits with a non - newtonian eccentricity as shown in eqs .",
    "( 127 ) and ( 129 ) . for the hyperbolic - type orbits in the newtonian limit , an approximate analytic expression [ eq.(134 ) ] has been presented that gives the difference between the general relativistic and the newtonian calculations for the angle between the two asymptotes and this expression is different from the one given by other authors [ 13 ] .",
    "the power of our analytic expressions for the orbits in the schwarzschild geometry is further illustrated by the numerous analytic simple expressions for many quantities that are presented for various special cases in section 7 .",
    "these examples include the cases of @xmath671 @xmath672 and @xmath673 and of @xmath113 and @xmath674 , and the expressions include those for @xmath127 , the geometrical eccentricity defined by eq.(25 ) , @xmath169 and @xmath197 discussed above , and also @xmath470 in the region @xmath55 . every expression from eq.(73 ) to eq.(106 )",
    "has been used to check the extensive numerical data for various orbits that were presented in refs.[2 ] and [ 3 ] , and we consider these simple relationships to be a bonus of our analytic formulation of the problem .    to better appreciate our presentation and characterization of all possible orbits in the schwarzschild geometry , we described in section 9 the analysis of chandrasekhar [ 5 ] in terms of our notations for the purpose of comparisons .",
    "equations ( 135 ) , ( 149 ) and ( 159 ) are , respectively , mathematically equivalent to our eqs.(18 ) , ( 35 ) and ( 43 ) . instead of using the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath43 as we adopted , chandrasekhar s formulation essentially used the parameters @xmath127 defined by eqs.(26 ) and ( 158 ) , and @xmath602",
    "defined by eq.(138 ) , for characterizing the orbits , but he often had to refer to the total energy [ @xmath20 of eq.(6 ) ] and total angular momentum @xmath675 [ which is a constant multiple of @xmath17 of eq.(5 ) ] of the particle and the effective potential energy curve when discussing certain features of the orbits . although the orbit equations appear to involve only simple trigonometric functions , the `` polar angles '' @xmath595 and @xmath631 are not the actual physical polar angle @xmath16 but are complicated implicit functions of @xmath16 [ see eqs.(137 ) , ( 150 ) , and the quote after eq.(159 ) ] .",
    "the two important physical quantities , @xmath20 and @xmath17 , are not only complicated functions of @xmath127 and @xmath602 , but the relations are different for different types of orbits [ see eqs.(143 ) , ( 144 ) , ( 160 ) , and ( 161 ) ] .",
