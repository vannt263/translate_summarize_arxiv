    "numerical simulations of lattice field theories are usually performed in the lagrangian formulation .",
    "the alternative approach of the hamiltonian formulation @xcite has received very little attention so far .",
    "nonetheless , we think there are very good reasons to develop numerical simulation techniques for the hamiltonian approach : powerful many - body techniques are available @xcite , which allow the direct computation of the vacuum wave function properties ; fermions are implemented directly and need not be integrated out ; property like the mass spectrum are more immediate",
    ". a check of universality between the lagrangian and the hamiltonian formalism would also be very welcome .",
    "the continuum two - dimensional wess - zumino model is defined by the supersymmetry charges @xmath0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a real scalar field , @xmath2 is its conjugate momentum , and @xmath3 is a majorana fermion .",
    "the charges obey the @xmath4 supersymmetry algebra @xmath5 which we have written in the majorana basis @xmath6 , @xmath7 . since @xmath8 is not conserved on the lattice , a lattice formulation of a supersymmetric model must break the algebra explicitly .",
    "a very important advantage of the hamiltonian formulation is that , since @xmath9 is conserved exactly , we can maintain a 1-dimensional supersymmetry subalgebra , e.g. , @xmath10 , and expect to recover the rest in the continuum limit , together with lorentz invariance @xcite ; this subalgebra is enough to guarantee some of the most important property of supersymmetry , including pairing of fermionic and bosonic states of nonzero energy ; spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is equivalent to nonzero ground - state energy @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt the lattice formulation @xcite @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with canonical ( anti)commutation rules , and @xmath13 .",
    "we can replace the majorana fields @xmath14 by one dirac field @xmath15 by the clever transformation @xcite @xmath16 obtaining the hamiltonian @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is explicitly free of sign problems , except potentially at the boundary ; we adopt _ free boundary conditions _ to avoid the sign problem altogether @xcite .    in strong coupling , the model reduces to a supersymmetric quantum mechanics for each site ; supersymmetry is broken if and only if the degree of the prepotential @xmath18 is even @xcite . in the continuum ( and on the lattice in weak coupling ) , supersymmetry is broken at tree level if and only if @xmath18 has no zeroes .",
    "the predictions of strong coupling and weak coupling are quite different , and it is interesting to study both numerically and analytically the crossover from strong to weak coupling .    as a benchmark of the case where supersymmetry is unbroken , we consider the cubic prepotential @xmath19 . in the more interesting case of broken supersymmetry",
    "we study the quadratic prepotential @xmath20 . here",
    ", spontaneous symmetry breaking is expected to occur at @xmath21 , while for @xmath22 the scenario is less clear ; in fact , weak coupling perturbation theory predicts a symmetric ground state while strong coupling predicts broken supersymmetry with @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "we perform our simulations by the green function monte carlo algorithm @xcite with the guiding wave function associated to the trial ground state @xmath25     f_n & = & p_1(\\phi_n)+(-1)^n(\\chi_n^\\dagger\\chi_n-1/2)p_2(\\phi_n),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the free ( @xmath27 ) ground state and @xmath28 are polynomials optimized according to the algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "we wish to remark that , in order to keep the variance of observables finite as the simulation proceeds , it is necessary to simulate a population of @xmath29 _ walkers _ ( field configurations at fixed time ) , and extrapolate the results to @xmath30 .",
    "the trial wave function is an important feature of our simulations , and we are able to determine accurately the free parameters .",
    "the trial wave function allows a substantially improvement of the quality of our numerical results ; moreover , since it is an approximation to the exact ground state , it contains important physical information about the model .",
    "this algorithm can be parallelized effectively on a network of pcs connected through ethernet ; our mpi code reaches 90% efficiency .",
    "we measure the ground - state energy @xmath11 , which is the simplest and most precise observable to measure in a quantum monte carlo , and a number of observables of the form @xmath31 , @xmath32 , which are zero for unbroken supersymmetry ( for any fermionic operator @xmath33 , @xmath34 is a supersymmetry ward identity ) .",
    "[ fig : e0-cubic ] shows the ground - state energy per site as a function of @xmath35 for the cubic prepotential @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the evidence for unbroken supersymmetry is quite convincing .",
    "the bosonic and fermionic contribution to @xmath38 are @xmath39 : we are observing a cancellation of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn by looking at @xmath31 , with smaller numerical accuracy .",

    "the data are insensitive to the value of @xmath47 , and they are consistent with a linear extrapolation to @xmath48 .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is clear for @xmath49 ; for smaller values of @xmath50 , we can not discriminate between @xmath51 and an exponentially decreasing @xmath11 .",
    "as in the cubic case , the study of @xmath31 gives similar conclusions , with smaller numerical accuracy .",
    "the hamiltonian approach is a worthwhile alternative to the usual lagrangian approach to lattice field theory .",
    "accurate monte carlo simulations can be performed and compared to analytical predictions , e.g. , strong coupling computations .",
    "fermions can be implemented directly and need not be integrated out , thus avoiding a non - local determinant ; for certain models in @xmath52 dimensions , like the one studied here , they present no additional costs compared to bosons .",
    "it should be observed however , that in higher dimension fermions lead to _ sign problems _ which need to be solved @xcite .",
    "another important advantage of the hamiltonian formalism is the possibility of preserving exactly a 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebra .    in the light of the encouraging preliminary results presented here",
    ", we plan to extend our study in several directions .",
