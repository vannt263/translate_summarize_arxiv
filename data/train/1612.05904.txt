    "plasmonic nanoantennas made from nanostructured metals have attracted significant attention in nonlinear optics due to their unique properties [ 1 ] .",
    "one such property is their ability to concentrate light in nanoscale volumes and subsequently boost the intensity of local fields near particle surfaces due to surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) [ 2 ] .",
    "the spr - enhanced near - fields allow weak nonlinear processes , which depend superlinearly on the local fields , to be significantly amplified giving rise to a promising research area called nonlinear plasmonics .",
    "the second - order nonlinear processes , e.g. , sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) and second - harmonic generation ( shg ) , are significantly dependent on the symmetry of both the material being used and the structure being studied [ 3 ] . they are forbidden in the bulk of centrosymmetric media under the electric dipole approximation . however , the breaking of inversion symmetry at surfaces results in surface nonlinear scattering [ 4 - 5 ] .",
    "the combination of nonlinear surface sensitive and strong near - field enhancement associated with spr provides a unique tool for ultrasensitive shape characterization [ 6 - 7 ] , super - resolution imaging , sensing and microscopy [ 8 - 10 ] , on - chip optical frequency conversion , switching and modulation [ 11 ] , etc .    efficient nonlinear scattering requires the presence of strong nonlinear polarization sources at the surface of nanostructures , as well as efficient scattering of the signal into the far - field .",
    "analogous to classical antenna , the objective of nonlinear nanoantenna design is the optimization and control of the spatial distribution of scattered light .",
    "several strategies have been applied to enhance the scattered nonlinear signals , including engineering near - field coupled nanoparticle clusters associated with fano resonances [ 12 - 13 ] , enhancing the electric fields using nanogaps [ 14 ] , etc .",
    "however , tailoring the radiation pattern of nonlinear nanoantennas has great challenges .",
    "first , nonlinear radiation exhibits complex multipolar interactions [ 15 - 16 ] .",
    "second , currently few tools are available for efficient and rigorous analyses of surface nonlinear scattering processes in complex structure . the volume discretization based full - wave methods , e.g. , finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) and finite element method ( fem ) , are inefficient and inaccurate for solving surface nonlinear problems .",
    "third , the relation between plasmon resonances , particle geometry , and associated local - field distributions is very complicated [ 17 ] .",
    "physical principles and design rules for nonlinear nanoantennas have not been explored yet .    in this work , a numerical solution based on the boundary element method ( bem ) is proposed for the second - order surface nonlinear scattering problems .",
    "the proposed method is efficient with a surface discretization ; and can employ experimentally tabulated material parameters directly . the developed solver is utilized to systematically analyze the sfg from a multi - resonant nanoantenna ( mr - na ) and shg from a novel particle - in - cavity nanoantenna ( pic - na ) with strong spr .",
    "the remaining of this article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we describe the bem method used in our study .",
    "3 contains the main results .",
    "we first validate the accuracy of the developed solver by comparing the far - field scattering patterns with mie theory results .",
