    "the main motivation for supersymmetry ( susy ) , besides its ability to stabilize the higgs mass against the radiative corrections , is the way it steers the gauge couplings , within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , towards the unification at a very high energy scale ( @xmath6 ) . assuming this is not an accident but a signal for a new physics we are prompted not only to embrace the mssm but to incorporate it into the grand unified theory ( gut ) where the gauge unification represents a genuine _ prediction _ of the framework .",
    "another genuine _ prediction _ of the true gut is , of course , a proton decay .",
    "it turns out , however , that it is very problematic to build both realistic and simple susy gut scheme and still preserve the exact gauge coupling unification .",
    "for example , the parameter space of the simplest of all such schemes , the minimal @xmath0 susy gut , has been severely constrained by the experimental limits on proton lifetime @xcite .",
    "the crux of the problem is that the exact gauge unification requires threshold corrections . but to create these corrections one needs certain fields , responsible for the proton decay , to be too light compared to the existing experimental constraints unless an _",
    "ad hoc _ tuning of parameters takes place @xcite .",
    "this problem was not so serious in the past since the low - energy values of the gauge couplings were not known well enough , leaving a lot of room for maneuvering .",
    "the situation has changed after the electroweak precision measurements and the improvements in measurements of the strong coupling constant .",
    "the error bars have simply become sufficiently small to prevent the exact unification without the help of the troublesome threshold corrections .",
    "so , the question of whether we can achieve the exact gauge unification in accord with the low - energy measurements in a natural manner within susy guts is something we have to address .    among the fields that can improve on the gauge unification , via threshold corrections , are the familiar colored higgsinos .",
    "these are the fields that are responsible for @xmath4 proton - decay operator .",
    "therefore , one wants them light enough to generate the appropriate corrections but heavy enough to avoid violation of the experimental limits on proton lifetime .",
    "this , again , is an extremely difficult task .",
    "one can entirely avoid the need of satisfying these conflicting requirements by using a flipped @xmath0 group  @xcite which automatically explains the absence of @xmath4 operators through the implementation of the simplest possible form of the missing partner mechanism  @xcite . however , flipped @xmath0 gives up one of the most attractive features of grand unification , namely unification of gauge couplings , because it is based on the group @xmath7 .",
    "[ this is not to say that the exact unification is impossible within the four - dimensional flipped @xmath0 . for",
    "the most recent considerations in this direction see refs .",
    "embedding the flipped @xmath0 within an @xmath1 gauge group retrieves the gauge unification but spoils the missing partner mechanism .",
    "the way out , as has been recently shown  @xcite , is to embed the flipped @xmath0 within an @xmath1 group in five dimensions using the extra - dimensional framework _  la _ kawamura  @xcite . in this way , at the four - dimensional level , the famous missing partners can still be missing and the doublet - triplet splitting can be achieved without the dangerous higgsino - mediated proton decay .",
    "but , one might expect naively that the exact gauge unification is impossible due to the threshold corrections that originate from the towers of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes that are inherent to the theories with the compactified extra - dimensions .",
    "this naive expectation turns out to be wrong .",
    "the five - dimensional theory , being non - renormalizable , _ must _ have a cutoff ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , the number of kk modes that contribute is finite .",
    "this also makes the threshold corrections finite and calculable so that the exact unification can not be excluded _",
    "a priori_.    this paper is devoted to the issues pertaining to the gauge coupling unification in the five - dimensional setting .",
    "we show , following the footsteps of kim and raby  @xcite , that it is possible to achieve the exact unification using an @xmath9 supersymmetric @xmath1 model on an @xmath10 orbifold .",
    "the orbifold has two inequivalent fixed points , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , identified by the action of @xmath13 twisting .",
    "on the point ( brane ) @xmath11 there will be an @xmath1 gauge symmetry while on the point ( brane ) @xmath12 there will be a flipped @xmath0 gauge symmetries .",
    "both symmetries will be the leftovers of a bigger , @xmath1 , bulk symmetry .",
    "the bulk contains , besides the vector supermultiplet , a pair of chiral hypermutiplets : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "they give the higgs fields of the mssm : @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the orbifolding procedure also reduces the amount of the supersymmetry from @xmath9 in five dimensions to @xmath9 in four dimensions . to obtain the low - energy phenomenology of the standard model ( sm ) group @xmath18 we break flipped @xmath0 on the @xmath12 brane by implementing the missing partner mechanism .",
    "this time , in contrast to the model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do the breaking with the chiral superfields that reside on the @xmath12 brane .",
    "there are two models in the literature we are going to compare our results with that provide the exact gauge coupling unification in the five - dimensional @xmath19 setting .",
    "the common feature for both models is the placement of the multiplets that contain the higgs fields and the gauge sector of the mssm in the bulk .",
    "we briefly review these models in what follows .",
    "* the first one is an @xmath0 model of hall and nomura  @xcite . in their model",
    "@xcite the orbifolding yields an @xmath0 gauge symmetry on one brane and the sm gauge symmetry on the other .",
    "in addition , the orbifolding accomplishes the doublet - triplet splitting by assigning the odd parity to the triplet fields .",
    "there is no need for any extra higgs breaking except for the usual electroweak one . for gauge coupling unification not to be spoiled by arbitrary non - universal contributions coming from the brane with the sm gauge symmetry hall and nomura",
    "have to invoke two requirements : ( i ) the couplings at the cutoff scale @xmath8 _ must _ enter a strong coupling regime ; ( ii ) the dimension(s ) of the bulk _ must _ be large enough ( when expressed in terms of the fundamental scale , i.e.  cutoff scale , of the theory ) .",
    "we adopt their requirements in our model , too .",
    "* the second model is a variant of an @xmath1 model of derm ' iek and mafi  @xcite . here",
    ", we just outline the features that are relevant for comparison with our work .",
    "since the breaking of @xmath1 down to @xmath18 demands the reduction of the group rank @xcite , the authors use an extra higgs breaking . in the original version of derm ' iek and mafi  @xcite the breaking of @xmath1 down to @xmath0 takes place on the @xmath1 brane .",
    "the low - energy signature of the sm gauge group is then due to the intersection of the pati - salam and @xmath0 .",
    "the subsequent analysis of the variant of their model proposed by kim and raby  @xcite demonstrated the feasibility of the gauge unification .",
    "the breaking , in kim and raby case , takes place on a pati - salam brane affecting only the gauge sector of the theory .",
    "[ the orbifolding has already projected out the triplet partners by assigning them odd parity . ]",
    "we adopt and extend their method of analysis to demonstrate the successful unification in our case .",
    "the reason behind the extension is that , in our case , the extra higgs breaking affects not only the gauge sector but also the higgs sector .",
    "namely , the breaking is what makes the triplets heavy via missing partner mechanism .",
    "this , as it turns out , has significant consequences on the renormalization group equation ( rge ) running of the gauge couplings as we demonstrate later .    in section  [ model ]",
    "we introduce our model and specify the mass spectrum of all the fields .",
    "we then proceed with the discussion on the gauge coupling rge running in five - dimensional orbifold setting in section  [ kkpart ] .",
    "this is where our two main results , the relevant beta coefficients and their rge numerical analysis , are presented .",
    "finally , we briefly conclude in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we present an @xmath1 supersymmetric model in five dimensions compactified on an @xmath20 orbifold .",
    "the orbifold is created after the fifth dimension , being the circle @xmath21 of radius @xmath22 , gets compactified through the reflection @xmath23 under @xmath24 and @xmath25 under @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "there are two fixed points , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , that bound the physical space @xmath28 $ ] of the bulk .",
    "the point @xmath11 is referred to as the  visible brane \" while point @xmath12 at @xmath29 is referred to as the  hidden brane \" .",
    "we assume that the bulk contains an @xmath9 vector supermultiplet , a @xmath30 of @xmath1 , and two chiral hypermultiplets , @xmath31 .",
    "the vector supermultiplet decomposes into a vector multiplet @xmath32 , which contains the gauge bosons @xmath33 and corresponding gauginos , and a chiral multiplet @xmath34 of @xmath35 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "each hypermultiplet splits into two left - handed chiral multiplets @xmath36 and @xmath37 , having opposite gauge quantum numbers . to reduce @xmath9 supersymmetry in five dimensions to @xmath9 supersymmetry in four dimensions we use the parity assignment under @xmath24 . to reduce the gauge symmetry from @xmath1 down to flipped @xmath38 on the hidden brane we use the parity assignment under @xmath39 .",
    "the bulk content of the model is    [ parity ] @xmath40    where the first ( second ) superscript denotes the parity assignment under @xmath24 ( @xmath39 ) transformation .",
    "only the fields with the @xmath41 parity contain kaluza - klein zero mode fields ( @xmath42 ) that have no effective four - dimensional mass .",
    "the masses of all other modes become quantized in units of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the compactification scale .",
    "for example , all @xmath45 and @xmath46 parity states are actually the kk towers of states with masses @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the mode number .",
    "we want to have the low - energy phenomenology that is described by the sm group @xmath18 .",
    "but , at this point , the brane @xmath11 feels the @xmath1 gauge symmetry while the brane @xmath12 feels the flipped @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "one could introduce a pair of higgses in the bulk , the @xmath49 and the @xmath50 , and use the parity assignment to project out all the states except a pair @xmath51 that is needed for the missing partner mechanism on the visible brane @xcite . here , however , we pursue slightly different direction .",
    "namely , noting that the minimal set of higgses that breaks flipped @xmath0 down to @xmath18 is a pair of higgs fields , @xmath51 , we posit their existence on the _ hidden _ brane .",
    "[ similar idea on using the minimal higgs content within an @xmath0 model has been exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] with these fields in place we specify the following brane localized entry of the superpotential : @xmath52 \\big[\\phi^{++}_{{\\bf 5}_1^{-2}}\\,{\\bf 10}^{1}_h\\,{\\bf 10}^{1}_h+ \\phi^{++}_{\\overline{{\\bf 5}}_2 ^ 2}\\,\\overline{{\\bf 10}}^{-1}_h\\ , \\overline{{\\bf 10}}^{-1}_h\\big],\\ ] ] where @xmath53 represents the yukawa coupling with the mass dimension -1/2 . clearly , by giving very large vevs to the @xmath54 components of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , we allow the triplet partners of the doublets in @xmath57 and @xmath58 to get large masses through the mating with the triplets of @xmath55 and @xmath59 without disturbing the lightness of the doublets .",

    "moreover , the symmetry breaking makes the states @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 from @xmath66 and @xmath67 of @xmath30 absorb the corresponding components of the brane higgses to become massive , leaving unbroken @xmath18 gauge symmetry behind .",

    "thus , we have that @xmath174\\ln \\frac{m_{\\rm gut}}{m_c}=\\delta^{\\rm gauge}_2+\\delta^{\\rm higgs}_2,\\\\ \\delta_3(m_c)&= \\big(2 \\pi/\\alpha_3(m_{\\rm gut})-2 \\pi/\\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\rm gut}\\big)\\\\ & \\quad + \\big[b^{\\mathcal{h}}_3(v)+ b^{\\mathcal{h}}_3({\\bf 2})]\\ln \\frac{m_{\\rm gut}}{m_c}=\\delta^{\\rm gauge}_3+\\delta^{\\rm higgs}_3 . \\end{split}\\ ] ] solving these equations yields @xmath175 where we use the same value of @xmath176 as is used by kim and raby  @xcite ( @xmath177 ) and we take the corresponding value of @xmath6 ( @xmath178gev ) .",
    "these values imply that @xmath179 , justifying the large @xmath152 approximations .",
    "this also ensures that the effect of the non - universal brane kinetic terms , present on the @xmath12 brane , on the gauge coupling unification is sufficiently small to be neglected  @xcite .    in view of our results",
    "the following picture emerges .",
    "the effective theory below the compactification scale looks exactly the same as the usual mssm theory .",
    "then , once we go above @xmath44 , there emerge the towers of the kaluza - klein states that change the behavior of the gauge running through the set of small but numerous threshold corrections .",
    "the theory finally yields the gauge unification at @xmath180 where all the couplings of the theory enter the strong regime . at that point",
    "the five - dimensional theory must be embedded into more fundamental physical picture .",
    "we should note that our result is not very sensitive to the exact value of the small parameter @xmath181 . on the other hand , the values of @xmath44 and @xmath8",
    "depend very strongly on the value of @xmath176 .",
    "we have taken @xmath177 to be able to compare our results with the analysis of kim and raby  @xcite .",
    "this value , coming from the rge propagation of the experimental value of @xmath182 @xcite from the @xmath183 scale to the gut scale , could be reduced in near future .",
    "namely , the new estimate of @xmath184 from @xmath185 lifetime suggests @xmath186 @xcite . this would have a large impact on our result since the corresponding value of @xmath176 ( @xmath187 )",
    "would imply @xmath188 , making the whole kk unification picture questionable .",
    "the model of kim and raby  @xcite for the case of @xmath187 yields @xmath189 .",
    "this paper is devoted solely to the analysis of the gauge coupling unification .",
    "this means that there are many questions left unanswered .",
    "for example , one might ask what mechanism breaks four - dimensional @xmath9 supersymmetry .",
    "or , how the higgs fields responsible for the missing partner mechanism get their vevs . our intention was not to answer the questions like these but to demonstrate the possibility of the five - dimensional kaluza - klein unification and this we did .",
    "but , some of these questions , including the possibility of having a model with the realistic mass patterns , have already been tackled in ref .",
    "[ there are , of course , different directions one might take .",
    "namely , a number of five - dimensional @xmath1 models with the pati - salam signature on one brane and @xmath1 signature on the other brane has been studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "even the most general scenario of having a model with the five - dimensional @xmath1 gauge symmetry that is broken by compactification on both branes has also been investigated recently @xcite . ]    our result for @xmath44 and @xmath8 is very similar to the result obtained by kim and raby  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the biggest correction to the standard four - dimensional running in both cases comes from the first term in eq .  .",
    "since this term involves the beta coefficients of the sm gauge group only , the leading corrections must be the same for all the schemes with the realistic low - energy signature .",
    "the main difference between the two models in the gauge sector is generated by the beta coefficients @xmath159 of the gauge group on the hidden brane . in our case",
    "the hidden brane has the flipped @xmath0 group with @xmath190 , while in the case of kim and raby the hidden brane harbors ps gauge group with @xmath191 .",
    "the main difference in the higgs sector stems from the fact that there is no distinction between the region i and region ii in kim and raby case since the additional boundary conditions do not affect the higgs sector at all .",
    "therefore , the second term in eq .",
    "is absent in their case .",
    "it is interesting to note that the difference between the two models is in the terms that are proportional to the small parameter @xmath181 .",
    "therefore , the limit @xmath192 gives the same result in both cases . in that limit we obtain @xmath193 , and @xmath194 .",
    "interestingly enough , the same limit reproduces the results of the analysis on the gauge coupling unification of the five - dimensional @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "one can even make a more general statement about various models yielding the same result in the limit when the brane breaking is large enough ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "namely , one expects the same corrections to the usual four - dimensional running in all models that fulfill the following conditions : i ) @xmath116 is a unified group ; ii ) @xmath18 corresponds to the sm group ; iii ) symmetry breaking @xmath195 is localized at the @xmath125 brane ; iv ) the mssm higgses originate from the bulk .",
    "clearly , all of the above conditions are satisfied by the models we consider .    even though the exact unification of the gauge couplings in the four - dimensional flipped @xmath0 can not be excluded @xcite",
    ", one can never justify the charge quantization and the hypercharge assignment without embedding it into @xmath1 . in our case",
    "this is not an issue .",
    "as long as the matter fields are placed in the bulk or on the visible brane we guarantee the charge quantization .",
    "[ of course , if the matter comes from the bulk multiplets we might lose the unification of quarks and leptons of one family . ] the exact location of the matter fields is conditioned by the presence of @xmath5 proton - decay operators induced by the exchange of the @xmath196 gauge bosons .",
    "namely , the experimental limit on proton lifetime yields the limit of @xmath197 on the mass @xmath198 of the @xmath196 gauge bosons within the four - dimensional flipped @xmath0 @xcite . since the mass spectrum of @xmath196 bosons in our model starts from the compactification scale ( @xmath199 ) it is clear that not all the families of matter fields can be placed on the visible brane .",
    "it is necessary for , at least , the first and the second family to come from the bulk multiplets .",
    "the idea of localizing the matter fields on the flipped @xmath0 brane does not appeal to us on the grounds of charge quantization .",
    "but , in that case , the suppression of the gauge field wave function on the flipped @xmath0 brane that is visible in fig .  [ deltakk ] is sufficient to make the prediction for the proton decay via @xmath200 channel very close to the present experimental bound ( see for example @xcite ) . in this aspect the model of kim and raby  @xcite",
    "does better job since the localization of the matter fields on the ps brane , in their case , still justifies the charge quantization .",
    "the only _ ad hoc _ feature of our model is the existence of the higgses on the hidden brane .",
    "it is difficult to justify their @xmath201 charges unless they originate from the @xmath202 and the @xmath203 bulk fields .",
    "[ this remains an open possibility .",
    "] we argue that their @xmath201 charges are what one expects from the fields of flipped @xmath0 and that they provide the anomaly cancellation on the hidden brane .",
    "the model can still produce interesting mass matrix patterns @xmath204 and @xmath205 that were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where , in our case , the relation @xmath204 holds only for the third family .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that this class of models allows for gaugino meditated supersymmetry breaking with the non - universal gaugino masses  @xcite which leads to the realistic supersymmetry mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "we have presented an @xmath1 model in five dimensions .",
    "the model has served to demonstrate that the exact unification of the gauge couplings is possible even in the higher dimensional setting .",
    "the corrections to the usual four - dimensional running have been due to the kaluza - klein towers of states .",
    "we have shown that despite the large amount of these states the corrections for the mssm running can be unambiguously and systematically evaluated .",
    "demanding the exact unification , the compactification scale is deduced to be @xmath2 with the cutoff of the theory at @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the five - dimensional theory exists in a rather large energy region before one needs to replace it with the more fundamental one .",
    "the usual problems of susy guts , such as the doublet - triplet splitting problem , have been solved in a natural way .",
    "for example , the presence of the flipped @xmath0 symmetry on the hidden brane has allowed us to implement the missing partner mechanism . at the same time",
    "the presence of the @xmath1 symmetry on the visible brane still allows one to obtain desirable predictions for the quark and lepton masses such as @xmath206 .",
    "the model yields the low - energy signature of the mssm .",
    "in addition , it allows for the justification of the charge quantization as long as the matter lives on the visible brane or in the bulk . due to @xmath5",
