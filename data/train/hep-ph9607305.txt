    "the most popular model for parametrizing quark flavor - changing currents and cp violation is that of mixing between quark mass and weak interaction eigenstates , as represented by the unitary cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix@xcite .",
    "although the unitary @xmath0 matrix for @xmath1 quark generations possesses @xmath2 observable real parameters , these parameters may be ( and have been ) chosen in countless different ways .",
    "even if we adopt the usual prescription of @xmath3 euler rotation angles and @xmath4 phases in generation space , we are still faced with the choice of which axes to use for our rotations and in what order to perform them ; this choice leads to no less than 36 distinct but equivalent parametrizations for three generations@xcite .",
    "the particular form of the ckm matrix advocated by the particle data group@xcite , as originally proposed by chau and keung@xcite , is just one of these , and is written @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the subscripts indicate the plane of rotation , and the euler angles @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are all chosen to lie in the first quadrant by a redefinition of ( unobservable ) quark field phases .",
    "the phase angle @xmath11 may not be similarly restricted : @xmath12 alternately , the ckm matrix may be described in terms of parameters invariant under choice of convention or phase redefinitions .",
    "the moduli of the elements @xmath13 fall into this category but are not always the most convenient variables in experimental measurements@xcite .",
    "for example , the short - distance contribution to @xmath14 mixing , ubiquitous in neutral @xmath15 decays , is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "unitarity information may be more easily recovered by noting that @xmath17 is equivalent to the orthogonality of columns or rows in @xmath18 : @xmath19 for two distinct columns or rows , the right hand side is zero , and so the condition may be depicted geometrically in complex space as describing a closed polygon with a one side corresponding to each quark generation . the conditions from  ( [ orth ] ) with 1 on the right hand side set the scale of the polygons . for three generations",
    "one obtains triangles , which are special since knowledge of the angles is sufficient to determine their shapes uniquely ; thus we concentrate on the three - generation case in this work .",
    "equation  ( [ orth ] ) implies that there are 6 independent triangles , called the unitarity triangles@xcite , which are pictured in fig .",
    "1 and labeled by the pair of rows or columns whose orthogonality is represented .",
    "our chief interest in the unitarity triangles is that their angles are convention - independent .",
    "one sees this by noting that for two complex numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the ( oriented exterior ) angle between them is @xmath22 , where the argument function assumes its principal value , @xmath23 , for all complex @xmath24 .",
    "thus angles in this case have the form @xmath25 each quark index in this expression appears in both a @xmath18 and a @xmath26 , so that any phase redefinition cancels in the product .",
    "geometrically , the redefinition of a quark phase simply rotates an entire unitarity triangle by a constant angle .",
    "it is also known that the 6 unitarity triangles all have the same area , given by the jarlskog parameter @xmath27@xcite .",
    "this follows first because @xmath28 unitary matrices enjoy the property that a a particular pattern of elements is invariant up to a sign : @xmath29 which defines @xmath27 for any choice of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and second because the area of a triangle with sides @xmath20 and @xmath21 is @xmath32 \\right|/2 $ ] .",
    "it follows that the area of each unitarity triangle is given by @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath27 is the unique convention - independent cp violation parameter of the ckm matrix , in that all measurable cp - violating quantities turn out to be proportional to @xmath27 , so that vanishing area in any of the unitarity triangles indicates the vanishing of cp violation in the ckm matrix .    by 3 by 4 by 4 by 3",
    "phenomenologically , much is already known about the unitarity triangles . as schematically indicated in fig",
    ".  1 , four of them are nearly flat because they possess one side much shorter than the other two . of the remaining two ,",
    "the * bd * triangle is of greatest current interest to experimentalists : its sides , which are expected to be of comparable length , represent the least well - known elements of the ckm matrix and will be accessible in several @xmath15 factories currently under development .",
    "there is already a large literature dedicated to methods of measuring the sides of the * bd * triangle and extracting its angles , denoted @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "all that has been said up to this point is already several years old .",
    "what has been appreciated only recently is that the angles of the unitarity triangles enjoy a number of elegant properties , and may be used@xcite to reconstruct the full ckm matrix except for the sign of @xmath27 , which has been determined by experiment to be positive@xcite .",
    "the success of this approach follows from the observation that the 6 triangles have 18 distinct sides in all , but only 9 distinct angles .",
    "one sees this by noticing that @xmath37 appears in both the * ij * and @xmath38 triangles , halving the potential number ; furthermore , applying the condition that the angles of any given triangle add to @xmath39 shows that these 9 angles may be written as sums and differences of only 4 independent angles .",
    "since this is also the number of independent parameters in the three - generation ckm matrix , the angles may be used as a basis for all convention - independent quantities .    to be specific ,",
    "we follow  @xcite in defining the interior angles : @xmath40 these definitions are used to label the angles in fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( not to be confused with the indices of @xmath37 ) are the same angles traditionally used in the literature for the * bd * triangle , so these angles form a natural and very useful basis for describing invariants of the ckm matrix .",
    "the form of these expressions is chosen so that each of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 lies in the range @xmath43 .",
    "note that the quantities @xmath37 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ angle ] ) appear different from , but are formally identical to , those in ref .",
    "@xcite , since @xmath44 .",
    "observe that , although the parameters @xmath45 do indeed contain the sum total of the unitarity information , some information is lost in the definitions ( [ aklang ] ) , since magnitudes of @xmath37 are taken . in fact , all that is lost is the orientation of the angles , namely , whether they are constructed in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction .",
    "since the angles must still form closed triangles , this formulation merely surrenders one s ability to distinguish between a particular triangle and its mirror image .",
    "this freedom corresponds to the sign of @xmath27 , as indicated by eqs .",
    "( [ angle ] ) and ( [ jdef ] ) .",
    "reference  @xcite shows how to reconstruct all measurable phases and moduli of the ckm matrix given only the angles of the unitarity triangles . on the other hand ,",
    "all of the parametrizations of the ckm matrix perform the same function , but in terms of quantities interpreted in a convention - dependent way . in the remainder of this paper , we derive a complete set of concise relations between the two parametrizations for the particular standard form of eq .",
    "( [ std ] ) .",
    "then we check that the transformations obey the appropriate limits for vanishing cp violation in the ckm matrix and consider the transformations in a phenomenologically useful limit .",
    "finally , we indicate the straightforward generalization to other parametrization choices and more quark generations .",
    "first observe that the following relation holds for all complex @xmath24 : @xmath46 since the argument function is related to the arctangent function , it is clear that one will obtain the cleanest expressions for the unitarity angles in terms of their tangents or cotangents ; why cotangents are superior for our purposes will become evident .",
    "in fact , simply inserting the elements of ( [ std ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ angle ] ) and ( [ aklang ] ) obtains the desired transformations in one direction for all angles of the unitarity triangles .",
    "we use the following compact notation : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 respectively represent sine , cosine , tangent , and cotangent , while the indices @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath24 , and @xmath53 respectively represent @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "a number in the index indicates a multiple angle so that , for example , @xmath54 . cotangents of the 9 angles ( or their supplements ) appearing in the unitarity triangles are : @xmath55 - \\frac{1}{4 } s_{4x } s_{4y } s_z ( 1 + s^2_z ) c_\\delta - s^2_{2y } s^2_z ( 1 - s^2_{2x } c^2_\\delta ) \\right\\}}{s_{2x } s_{2y } s_z c^2_z |s_\\delta| } .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] several comments are in order .",
    "first , it is obvious that the first four of these expressions are quite simple , the next four are of intermediate complexity , and the last is quite complicated .",
    "the origin of this distinction becomes clear with a glance at ( [ std ] ) : the elements with complicated forms in the lower - left @xmath56 submatrix ( each the sum of a real and a complex number ) respectively appear 1 , 2 , or 4 times in using ( [ angle ] ) to compute the corresponding first four , middle four , and final expressions in eq .",
    "( [ ltor ] ) .",
    "this feature is repeated in any parametrization of the ckm matrix using euler angles and phases .",
    "since the angles appearing in the first four expressions in ( [ ltor ] ) are independent , and the cotangent function is one - to - one on @xmath43 , these four simple expressions contain all the information of the ckm matrix except the sign of @xmath27 .",
    "the chosen ckm parametrization picks out particular combinations of the basis angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 in which the transformation equations are simple .",
    "it is now clear that cotangents are chosen over tangents so that adding the quantities in ( [ ltor ] ) in order to invert them is simpler .",
    "second , as for the sign of @xmath27 , note that the dependence of each expression in ( [ ltor ] ) on the cp - violating phase @xmath11 occurs only through the functional forms @xmath57 or @xmath58 and so is insensitive to the variable change @xmath59 ; this is explicitly how the parametrization of ( [ std ] ) is sensitive to the sign of @xmath27 but the angles of ref .",
    "@xcite are not .",
    "finally , important limiting cases are evident from these transformations . as is well known",
    ", cp violation does not occur in the ckm matrix if any of the following conditions hold : @xmath60 in such cases our transformations ( [ ltor ] ) must satisfy the property that the unitarity angles collapse to zero area . to see this , note that the denominator of each expression in ( [ ltor ] ) , as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ angle ] ) , ( [ jdef ] ) , and ( [ cotdef ] ) , is just @xmath61 . in the standard parametrization  ( [ std ] ) ,",
    "@xmath62 so that @xmath27 is seen to vanish when any of the conditions in ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied . if one could ignore the numerators in ( [ cotdef ] ) , each expression in ( [ ltor ] ) would become singular under the conditions ( [ cond ] ) , making each unitarity angle 0 or @xmath39 so that the unitarity triangles would collapse .",
    "however , in some cases the numerator factors cancel factors in the denominator , and so some of the angles continue to assume finite values even when certain conditions in ( [ cond ] ) are satisfied . for example , for @xmath63 , @xmath64 . in such cases ,",
    "however , the unitarity triangles may still be seen to collapse . for , in the given example",
    ", consider the * bd * triangle in fig .  1 .",
    "in the same limit , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 add to @xmath39 .",
    "thus the sides @xmath67 and @xmath68 are parallel , requiring @xmath69 to have zero length for the triangle to close , and the triangle collapses .",
    "all limiting cases from eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) lead to trivial unitarity triangles using similar observations .",
    "the angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 as defined in ( [ aklang ] ) are bounded between 0 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , not all values for all of the angles are simultaneously allowed . in order for the unitarity triangles to close",
    ", their allowed ranges must be correlated .",
    "if one chooses them in the order @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , one requires @xmath70 we now derive the inverse transformations to eq .",
    "( [ ltor ] ) . as pointed out above , four combinations of the angles",
    "are particularly convenient to work with for this purpose , and for convenience we use the following notation for them : @xmath71 from ( [ ltor ] ) one sees that differences of @xmath72 , @xmath15 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 eliminate the @xmath75 factor , and quotients eliminate the @xmath76 . in particular , @xmath77 the quantities given here are manifestly nonnegative , as may be checked using the range constraints ( [ range ] ) and the monotonic decrease of cotangent over @xmath78 .",
    "one other combination is particularly simple : @xmath79 from here it is trivial to obtain expressions for the parameters of the standard form ( [ std ] ) : @xmath80 it is permissible to use only the positive branches of square roots since the angles @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 in ( [ std ] ) are chosen to lie in the first quadrant , and cotangent and sine are one - to - one on @xmath81 .",
    "note that only @xmath75 can be determined , reflecting the discrete ambiguity between @xmath11 and @xmath82 .",
    "one may be troubled by the fact that parameters specific to a particular representation of the ckm matrix are written here in terms of its invariants , but this indicates only that the interpretation of a given parameter as a phase or rotation about particular axes , not its value , is convention - dependent .",
    "the situation is analogous to lorentz invariance : the norm of the momentum four - vector of a free particle is most easily computed in the rest frame , where the zero component of the vector has the interpretation of rest mass @xmath83 , but @xmath83 is also numerically the norm of the vector in any frame .",
    "one can also see explicitly from the transformations ( [ rtol ] ) how the cp - vanishing cases of ( [ cond ] ) are recovered when the unitarity triangles collapse .",
    "if the angles @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath41 , or @xmath42 approach 0 or @xmath39 , then the cotangents either become singular , as for @xmath72 when @xmath84 , or two of them become degenerate , such as @xmath72 and @xmath15 when @xmath85 .",
    "in such cases , the expressions in ( [ rtol ] ) are seen to assume the values of eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) . for completeness , we present the jarlskog parameter in these variables , which is seen to satisfy the same degeneracy constraints : @xmath86}{\\left [ ( a - b+c - d)^2 + ( bd - ac)^2 \\right]^2 } .\\ ] ] finally , we consider the transformations in the phenomenologically interesting case of @xmath87 .",
    "it is straightforward to show from eqs .",
    "( [ rtol ] ) that @xmath88 note the particular vanishing behaviors of the angles as @xmath41 , @xmath89 .",
    "also note that in this limit @xmath90 , using the experimentally determined positive sign of @xmath27 .",
    "from the construction detailed above , it should be clear that an analogous program can be carried out for any parametrization using euler angles and phases , leading to concise transformation expressions .",
    "the key point is that in such parametrizations elements more complicated than a real number times a phase , which complicate the calculation in eq .",
    "( [ angle ] ) , are relegated to a @xmath56 minor submatrix .",
    "the unique element of the ckm matrix that does not share a row or column index with this @xmath56 minor is thus distinguished ; in the case of the standard form ( [ std ] ) , this element is @xmath91 .",
    "the angles of the unitarity triangles for which the analogous expressions to ( [ ltor ] ) are simple are exactly those adjacent to a side containing the distinguished element of @xmath18 , as is clear for the case we have considered , from fig .  1 . as another example , consider the original ckm parametrization of kobayashi and maskawa@xcite : @xmath92 here the distinguished element is @xmath93 , and the simplest expressions to use will be the cotangents of @xmath34 , @xmath94 , @xmath42 , and @xmath95 .",
    "a similar treatment for the wolfenstein parametrization@xcite , defined by @xmath96 is not immediately possible , since the matrix is only unitary to corrections of order @xmath97 .",
    "only once an extension rendering it fully unitary , of which there are many possible choices , is agreed upon can the full conversion between @xmath72 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 and the unitarity angles be carried out .",
    "finally , we show how any four independent moduli @xmath101 form an equivalent set to the four independent unitarity angles or standard ckm angles modulo the sign of @xmath27 .",
    "showing they are equivalent to the unitarity angles requires using the normalization of rows and columns of the ckm matrix to compute the other five moduli , and using the full set to compute the lengths of the sides ( and hence the angles ) of the unitarity triangles . starting instead with the standard form ( [ std ] ) , one computes",
    "the remaining five moduli as before and then extracts @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath8 respectively from @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath11 may be extracted from any of the four moduli in the lower - left @xmath56 submatrix , but because a number and its complex conjugate have the same norm , this process is insensitive to the transformation @xmath105 , or equivalently the sign of @xmath27 .",
    "similar remarks apply to any particular representation .",
    "if it turns out that there are more than three generations of quarks , the angles of the unitarity polygons are no longer sufficient to determine the entire structure of the ckm matrix . in four generations , for example , a square and a rectangle have the same angles but are not similar figures . nor",
    "are moduli alone enough , as one sees from comparing rhombi and squares .",
    "it is clear that one then requires both unitarity angles and moduli .",
    "nevertheless , generalizations of euler forms like eq .",
    "( [ std ] ) to more than three generations must continue to have `` distinguished '' elements for which expressions relating convention - dependent ckm angles to convention - independent angles of unitarity polygons remains usefully succinct .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to reconstruct all four invariant quantities of the ckm matrix ( but not the sign of the jarlskog parameter ) using only four independent moduli @xmath101 : see c. jarlskog and r. stora , phys .",
    "b * 208 * ( 1988 ) 268 .",
    "in fact , the sign of @xmath27 appears to be already experimentally determined as + 1 . in the wolfenstein parametrization @xmath106 , and @xmath100 as determined through @xmath107 mixing is positive , assuming the bag parameter @xmath108 from short - distance calculations is also positive ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xmath100 could have been negative , for example , if the neutral @xmath109 eigenstate mass difference @xmath110 had been negative ."
