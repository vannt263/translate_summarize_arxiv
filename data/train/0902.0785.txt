    "any celestial object with a non - zero temperature emits infrared radiation ( i.e. heat ) . because the wavelength at which the object most intensively radiates depends on the temperature , observing in the spectral range that goes from 1@xmath0 m to 1000@xmath0 m gives access to objects at a wide range of temperatures from a few tens of degrees kelvin to several thousands .",
    "although spectral boundaries are not firmly set , the region from 1@xmath0 m to 5@xmath0 m is defined as the near - infrared , from 5@xmath0 m to @xmath730@xmath0 m we refer to the mid - infrared domain ( or _ thermal _ infrared ) , while the far - infrared extends up to 1000@xmath0 m .",
    "the mid - infrared becomes a highly interesting observing regime , where warm objects with temperatures of @xmath7100600k can be probed .",
    "this corresponds to a temparature range where physical conditions for liquid water are encountered .",
    "it is also the range of peak emission of telluric planets around solar - type stars and therefore an appropriate domain for detecting the self - emission of nearby exoplanets .",
    "furthermore , bio - markers such as water , co@xmath3 or o@xmath4 ( ozone ) can be revealed through low - resolution spectroscopic observations .",
    "mid - infrared sources have become unquestionably a powerful source of information for relatively new fields like astrobiology and astrochemistry .",
    "new technologies have constantly played a key role in improving the performance of astronomical instruments . with technology advancing at a rapid rate , future projects like the _ e - elt _ ( european extremely large telescope ) , multi - aperture imaging or space - based infrared interferometry require us to fully reconsider the approach adopted so far for classical instruments .",
    "this can be justified by the high level of complexity of the classical solutions , the requirement of unprecedent performance or the need for reducing physically the size of future instruments . in this context",
    ", photonics can undoubtedly help to face some of this challenge . in the last decade",
    ", there has been an increasing and innovative use of photonic devices in astronomy .",
    "optical fibers , the simplest photonics elements , are now commonly used for fiber - fed spectrographs in the visible . in the specific area of stellar interferometry , single - mode optical fibers are valuable for their spatial filtering capabilities , which help improving the accuracy on the interferometric visibilities @xcite .",
    "fibers are currently used on various interferometers like chara @xcite or amber / vlti @xcite and will be implemented in future instruments to interconnect telescopes separated by a few hundred meters distance @xcite . beside optical fibers , integrated optics ( io )",
    "is very promising for next generation multi - aperture interferometers since it offers the possibility of combining several beams in a single chip , leading to obvious advantages in terms of space and stability .",
    "this concept was implemented in the past on the iota interferometer @xcite , and is foreseen to be part of the vlti second generation instrumentation @xcite .",
    "this is the prelude to a valuable miniaturization of the interferometric instrumentation , possibly extending it in the future to other instrument concepts like integrated spectrograph @xcite .",
    "photonic devices could also be helpful in the context of space - based experiments , where simple designs , and reliable and stable components are absolutely necessary .",
    "this points are important in particular for future interferometric missions like _ darwin / tpf _ , _ pegase _ or _",
    "sim_.    photonics has several strong advantages from the instrumental point - of - view , which justifies the extension of the concept towards new wavelengths .",
    "some of these aspects which have been described in detail in @xcite deserve our interest .",
    "the compactness offered by photonics - based components is a major advantage in the context of large telescope instrumentation and multi - aperture interferometry : _ integrated _ features allows us to save space and weight , and at the same time reduces the overall instrumental complexity .",
    "photonics components can be placed in direct contact with a cryostat window or a detector @xcite ; they allow flux transportation in a much easier way than long optical trains ; they permit faster and simpler instrument upgrade when dealing with optical chips ; _ single - mode _ fibers and integrated optics allow very accurate beam cleaning , thanks to spatial and modal filtering , which is an essential aspect of aperture synthesis and nulling interferometers @xcite ; when the waveguide is placed in a chilled enclosure , its limited numerical aperture acts as a field stop , avoiding straylight entering the system from outside the acceptance cone .",
    "this is an advantage when operating in the infrared , where thermal background from nearby warm optics is very high . from these different points ,",
    "photonics appears very attractive in the context of instrument miniaturization .",
    "however , the strong telecom background of photonics has concentrated the technological effort in few narrow bands of the near - infrared spectrum , where fully mature technology is available .",
    "when considering longer wavelengths of the _ astronomical _ mid - infrared spectrum , photonics suffers from a significant technological gap , which results from a weak mastering of the materials production and manufacturing processes at these wavelengths .",
    "promising efforts , mainly driven by the potential applications of photonics in fields like astronomy , chemistry and biophysics , are being made to reduce the gap .",
    "the increasing use of photonic devices for astronomical instrumentation has led to the neologism _",
    "the selection criteria for materials are based on the transparency window and on the corresponding intrinsic and extrinsic losses within this window .",
    "the window borders are determined by absorption , both on the visible and mid - infrared part of the spectrum .",
    "the intrinsic losses depend only on the material structure and properties and represent the minimum expected losses . however , the presence of impurities and defects further degrades the transmission and these losses are generally more important .",
    "we then talk about extrinsic losses .",
    "in the particular case of silica in the telecommunications industry , the refinement of the manufacturing technology over several years has led to high level of purity and quality , which makes the material losses close to the intrinsic levels .",
    "the physical explanation for intrinsic losses are found in material electronic transitions , phonon interactions and free - carrier effects .",
    "the interested reader can refer to well - established reference books on optical and infrared materials @xcite .",
    "the infrared materials that have been tested so far in the context of dielectric photonics devices are chalcogenide glasses , silver - halide glasses and zinc selenide components .",
    "most of these are also transparent in the visible .",
    "this has to be considered in case the resulting components have to operate in an environment non - shielded from optical radiation . on the other hand",
    ", this offers an advantage for alignment .",
    "all these materials are transparent at least up to 11 - 12@xmath0 m . depending on the chemical composition and the stoichiometry",
    ", the transmission range can be extended up to 1820@xmath0 m for the chalcogenide and zinc selenide glasses , or even beyond for silver halide glasses .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic properties , other factors may influence the optical behavior of these materials .",
    "these are:0.25 cm  mechanical stress : most infrared materials show a certain fragility and high sensitivity to shocks , which may complicate the manufacturing and polishing processes.0.1 cm  chemical stability : some materials can absorb water vapor , which further affects their transparency . in some cases , vacuum operation is required.0.1 cm ",
    "thermal stress : while fibers are sensitive to temperature , integrated optics are generally more stable with regard to thermal constraints @xcite .",
    "0.1 cm  spatial homogeneity : when a large surface is required to manufacture complex devices , it is important to ensure a good degree of homogeneity of the optical properties over the whole sample .",
    "underestimating this aspect might bring in differential effects ( dispersion etc ... ) that must then be carefully controlled.0.25 cm    infrared glasses are typically classified in amorphous and crystalline forms , depending on the regular ( crystalline ) or irregular ( amorphous ) arrangement of the atomic structure .",
    "+ amorphous materials include oxide glasses ( e.g. sio@xmath3 ) which present strong absorption in the mid - infrared due to oh vibration modes .",
    "other members of this group are chalcogenide glasses ( based on s , se and te ) . the transmission of these materials can be extended beyond 12@xmath0 m by the addition of heavy compounds ( ag , te ) .",
    "+ crystalline materials show a regular pattern in their structure ( e.g. quartz , the crystalline form of sio@xmath3 ) .",
    "silver halides  bromide or chloride  are also crystalline materials well known in mid - infrared applications .",
    "semiconductors , also classified in this category , are attractive materials due to their extended transmission range in the infrared",
    ". + so far , chalcogenide and silver halide glasses are the two main materials that have been investigated to cover the mid - infrared range .",
    "typical chalcogenide glasses are as@xmath3se@xmath43 and as@xmath3s@xmath4 , which present good transparency up to @xmath71216@xmath0 m .",
    "compositions including germanium ( ge ) or tellurium ( te ) can extend the transmission range up to 20@xmath0 m .",
    "silver halide glasses have excellent transparency up to and beyond 20@xmath0 m . in terms of materials properties",
    ", silver halide glasses may encounter corrosive risks if in contact with metals .",
    "furthermore , they present photosensitive properties , which require particular care if this effect is undesirable . on the other hand , the material photosensitivity can also been exploited for controlled laser writing of waveguides ( see sect .",
    "[ io ] ) .        these types of dielectric waveguide represent a natural choice for developing guided optics for the mid - infrared , since they represent a spectral evolution of near - infrared concepts .",
    "we raise here only those issues which are important for the rest of the paper . for a detailed study of optical fibers and integrated optics principles",
    ", the reader can refer to classical references @xcite .",
    "several refractive index profile can be considered when designing optical fibers : single - step index profile , double - step index profile , and smooth profile .",
    "the opto - geometrical parameters of the fiber ( core and cladding size , refractive index difference @xmath8n ) have a strong influence on the transmission range , the field confinement ( strong or weak ) or the numerical aperture .",
    "most relevant for some astronomical applications are single - mode fibers .",
    "an important parameter to measure modal behavior is the normalized frequency of the fiber @xmath9 with core radius @xmath10 and wavelength @xmath11 to be compared to the first order cut - off frequency @xmath12 .",
    "depending on the index profile of the fiber , the single - mode bandwidth can be theoretically infinite ( single - step index and smooth profiles ) or finite ( double - step index fibers under certain conditions on the cladding index ) . as for classical fibers ,",
    "_ planar _ dielectric integrated optics confines the light by total internal reflection .",
    "the main difference with fibers is on the waveguide geometry and on a stiff and fixed arrangement of the waveguides on the substrate surface .",
    "the basic brick is the slab waveguide , whose modal properties are governed by the dispersion equation of the slab waveguide @xcite .",
    "an integrated optics chip can gather within a small glass surface a high number of optical functions .",
    "it becomes a very powerful solution for interconnecting interferometrically several telescopes and obtaining accurate phase - shifted outputs for measuring visibilities @xcite .",
    "non - linear crystals such as lithium niobate ( linbo@xmath4 ) are used to build active components , such as electro - optic modulators with high accuracy phase control .",
    "the combination of integrated optics beam combiners and dispersing elements ( e.g. awg or arrayed waveguide gratings ) could lead to promising end - to - end integrated instruments with unprecedent mechanical stability .",
    "in practice , as for many photonic device , integrated optics chips present a certain number of limitations on their wide spread use in astronomy .",
    "the effective bandwidth of operation is generally narrow and the optical functions are highly wavelength dependent .",
    "cross - talk effects between different channels can degrade the useful signal , although this can reduced by a careful design of the chip .      [",
    "cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]      the straightforward method is to measure the fiber output beam profile at discrete wavelengths . if it corresponds to the field distribution as expected from theory and if it does not change in shape when changing the input beam launch conditions or when bending the fiber , the fiber can be assumed to be single - mode .",
    "the output beam profile can either be measured with an infrared camera or by scanning with a single - pixel detector . from the fiber divergence angle ,",
    "the normalized frequency @xmath13 can be directly deduced @xcite . due to the limited accuracy",
    ", measuring the fiber output beam profile provides only a qualitative assessment .",
    " because the fundamental mode of a single - mode fibers is symmetric with respect to the fiber axis , the single - mode behavior and the spatial filtering capabilities can be investigated by launching an antisymmetric beam into the fiber @xcite .",
    "if the fiber is purely single - mode , no signal can theoretically be measured at the fiber output .",
    "any leakage signal at the fiber output is due to higher - order modes , back - reflection of cladding modes , or to a not perfectly antisymmetric input field .",
    "the ratio of leakage power @xmath14 to the incident power @xmath15 may serve as a qualitative metric . a simple way for realizing an antisymmetric field is a step - like mirror .",
    "the required antisymmetry of the input field is the limiting factor for this method . ",
    "spatial wavefront filtering with single - mode fibers is of particular importance in nulling interferometry for equalizing the transverse field distributions in order to achieve high rejection ratios .",
    "such interferometric test setup can therefore be used to verify the single - mode behavior and the spatial filtering capability @xcite .",
    "for instance , the rejection ratio ( constructive to destructive interference power ) of a mach - zehnder interferometer is supposed to be much higher when employing a single - mode fiber at its output ( @xmath16 ) compared to the rejection ratio achievable without the fiber ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath18 , also called filter action , serves as a quality metric for the improvement in the rejection ratio .",
    "all measurements suffer from residual light guided in the cladding .",
    "this is significant for mid - infrared fibers , which have usually short length due to the high attenuation . absorbing coatings are therefore mandatory for those astronomical applications that rely on the mode purity .",
    "furthermore , aperture masks may be applied at the fiber entrance or exit . however , their achromaticity has to be taken into account for broadband applications .",
    "as an alternative to monochromatic characterization methods , it is also possible to detect modal cut - off wavelengths in the waveguide spectrum as less power is transported with increasing wavelength .",
    "it is then possible to identify in this way single - mode , bimode , trimode regions etc ... this method , commonly applied in the near - infrared @xcite , is more delicate to implement in the mid - infrared because of the lack of bright blackbody sources .",
    "however , coupling the detection chain with a high - sensitivity mct single - pixel detector and a lock - in detection provides a sufficient signal - to - noise gain to measure mid - infrared calibrated spectra through the waveguide @xcite .",
    "low - loss waveguides obviously help in increasing the experimental snr .",
    "eventually , evidence of single - polarization in the case of hollow rectangular waveguides can be exploited to demonstrate at a given wavelength the single - mode nature of the waveguides .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to assess the modal behavior at 10.6@xmath0 m of the rectangular samples shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "among the mid - infrared waveguide prototypes presented in sect .  [ manufacture ] ,",
    "chalcogenide and silver - halide fibers had single - mode behavior tested through output field imaging and consequent qualitative fitting to the gaussian profile of the fiber fundamental mode ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] and @xcite ) . in the other cases ,",
    "nulling interferometry techniques were used to measure a high order modes rejection ratio of about 1000@xmath19300 @xcite and a filter action @xmath18=400 .",
    "the modal behavior of integrated optics waveguides has been up to now assessed by output field imaging . in the last ten years",
    ", there has been a strong improvement in the measurement of the absolute rejection ratio obtained thanks to modal filtering through several experiments in the visible , near and mid - infrared .",
    "several teams in europe and in the u.s . have been working on nulling interferometry based on single - mode waveguides improving rejection ratios up to 10@xmath20 to 10@xmath21 , depending on the wavelength range and bandwidth @xcite , and getting very close to the requirement of 10@xmath22 broadband rejection ratio in the mid - infrared .",
    "note that other nulling experiments based on bulk optics setup provided very deep null , but they are not presented here since they do not have photonic devices implemented .",
    "we presented in this paper an overview of the research activities in the field of mid - infrared astrophotonics .",
    "the effort from different groups has concentrated mainly on the development of single - mode waveguides like fibers and integrated optics .",
    "many dielectric - based solutions explored for the mid - infrared are inspired from near - infrared concepts , like step - index and graded - index fibers .",
    "other concepts like hollow waveguides , which are specifically designed to operate beyond 23@xmath0 m and that do not have strong applications in the telecom bands , have been investigated with some success .",
    "integrated optics at mid - infrared wavelengths is also emerging with the development of single - mode channel waveguides manufactured on planar waveguides .",
    "photonics crystal fibers are part of a new generation of promising waveguides , but it should be acknowledged that pcfs for the mid - infrared are still at an experimental level . single - mode behavior has been successfully demonstrated experimentally for different technologies , ultimately through nulling interferometry experiments where the measured quantity is the extinction ratio of the source light .",
    "two hard points appear to be limiting factors for mid - infrared photonics : the first one concerns the high losses measured for these structures .",
    "however , this is mainly resulting from the non - optimized manufacturing techniques , which increasing maturity in the next years will help to improve the performance .",
    "the second point concerns the relative narrow bandwidth of the developed waveguides when compared to the astronomical needs .",
    "the experimental characterization has been often limited to a narrow wavelength range around 8.4@xmath0 m or 10.6@xmath0 m .",
    "broadband characterization will help in the future to better answer to astronomical requirements .",
    "although mid - infrared photonics has not reached yet the level of maturity obtained in near - infrared , the results of the last five to ten years are promising and open the way to new perspectives .",
    "+ some concern the short - term improvement of the existing technologies . in particular , the demonstration of planar integrated channel waveguides is a key step towards first optical functions like beam combination .",
    "furthermore , single - mode mid - infrared fibers have shown very good filtering properties in the context of nulling interferometry , which will be probably further improved in the coming years . in the long - term , while fibers appear as a rapidly maturing technology for mid - infrared stellar interferometry , integrated optics could be the ideal technology for instrumentation that requires to combine several optical functions .",
    "in particular , considering the future elts ",
    "_ extremely large telescopes _",
    " integrated optics could have spectroscopic capabilities included within the same optical chip @xcite , which is certainly of a major interest for facilities growing in size and cost .",
    "eventually , beyond the frame of astrophotonics , mid - infrared photonics presents applications in the field of chemical and biological sensors , which makes them even more attractive for the next decades .",
