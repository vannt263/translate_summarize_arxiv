    "the lowest excited singlet state of ammonia , the  state , has been subject to extensive spectroscopic study by a range of methods .",
    "however , since the first report by leifson@xcite , it has been known that conventional techniques provide a limited amount of information .",
    "leifson reported that the  state absorption begins at about 220 nm , principally consists of a single long progression , and is diffuse .",
    "he interpreted this diffuseness as due to a rapid predissociation of the excited state such that the one photon spectrum shows resolved vibrational but not rotational structure .",
    "walsh and warshop @xcite were able to show that the excited state is planar ; hence , the long progression observed by leifson@xcite resulted from a large displacement of @xmath2 , the out - of - plane bending mode .",
    "they also showed that the  state has a@xmath10 electronic symmetry and an n ",
    "h bond length greater than that of the ground electronic state .    with higher resolution than previous investigations ,",
    "douglas@xcite partially resolved the rotational structure in the two lowest vibronic bands of nd@xmath0 and obtained rotational constants for these levels .",
    "analysis of the rotational constants neglecting vibration - rotation interactions confirmed the prediction of walsh and warshop@xcite suggesting that in the excited state , the bond length was significantly displaced .",
    "such a large displacement in this coordinate also implied that in the absorption spectrum , a second progression in the symmetric stretching mode should also have been observed .",
    "as expected from above , a long progression in @xmath11 is observed in the  state resonance raman spectrum@xcite and dispersed emission from the nd@xmath0 2@xmath9 level@xcite .",
    "several hypotheses have been given to explain how the @xmath11 progression is missing in absorption but seen in emission .",
    "as initially suggested by harshbarger@xcite , one hypothesis proposes that the separate @xmath11 progression was not observed in absorption because the @xmath2 and @xmath11 modes were in a near 3:1 degeneracy , the separate @xmath11 progression being buried underneath the more intense @xmath2 progression .",
    "however , even under the cold conditions of a jet expansion , no separate progression was revealed for nh@xmath0 or nd@xmath0@xcite .",
    "another one proposes that the @xmath11 mode predissociates so rapidly that its broad transition width precludes its observation@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite have observed a feature that they assigned to the @xmath11 fundamental in dispersed fluorescence from the higher lying c@xmath12 state .",
    "they reported transition widths of  500  @xmath13 for these bands . in the following paper@xcite",
    ", we will examine the predissociation of the  state in detail . on the basis of that work",
    ", we assign the barrier to n - h dissociation as 2075  @xmath13 , implying essentially direct dissociation from levels with the n ",
    "h stretching mode excited . as a result , we believe that any @xmath11 progression would produce an essentially continuous absorption .",
    "et al._@xcite provided a third explanation for the lack of a @xmath11 progression in the absorption spectrum . using a model surface , with a small change in bond length at the ground state minimum , but a large change near the excited state planar geometry , they calculate that there should be @xmath11 activity in emission but not absorption from the ground state . thus , the two need not have the ` symmetry ' that is predicted by normal mode theory .",
    "the  @xmath14 x transition has also been thoroughly investigated by a variety of theoretical techniques . from the casscf and cepa wavefunctions for the symmetric modes , rosmus _",
    "et al._@xcite calculated the potential energy surfaces ( pes ) for both the x and  states .",
    "these calculations confirmed that the  @xmath14 x transition was accompanied by a geometry change and that the n - h(d ) equilibrium bond length is longer in the excited state ; yet , the calculated  state n h(d)bond length was still much less than the experimental estimate@xcite .",
    "they proposed that this discrepancy was due to errors caused by neglect of vibration - rotation interactions in reducing the observed rotational constants to an equilibrium geometry .",
    "the smaller displacement in this coordinate reduces the expected intensity of the missing @xmath11 progression compared to the previous estimates@xcite .",
    "imre and co - workers@xcite have modeled the  @xmath14 x absorption spectrum using a time - dependent formalism . using the unmodified potential of rosmus _",
    "et al._@xcite with only the out - of - plane bend and symmetric stretching coordinates modeled , their calculated spectrum peaks to the red of the observed one .",
    "agreement between experimental and calculated spectra was only achieved by modifying the potential of rosmus _",
    "et al._@xcite to include a longer n - h bond length .",
    "however , increasing the n - h bond length also increases the @xmath11 franck - condon factors .",
    "hence , a progression in @xmath11 is again predicted . in their work@xcite , however , they found that @xmath11 and 3@xmath2 progressions moved in a concerted fashion to yield in absorption only a single progression . because of their neglect of the asymmetric stretching modes",
    ", their calculation did not include the effects of predissociation to nh@xmath1 and h , and therefore , the lifetime broadening of these levels .",
    "rosmus _ et al._@xcite calculated the @xmath11 frequency at 2835  @xmath13 . however , through dispersed fluorescence from the longer lived c@xmath12 state@xcite , the frequency of this mode was measured at 2300 @xmath15 500  @xmath13@xcite .",
    "dixon@xcite resolved this discrepancy by including in the theoretical determination interactions between @xmath11 and the dissociative @xmath16 coordinate .",
    "inclusion of these interactions also enabled dixon to accurately model the observed transition widths@xcite .",
    "however , unlike the previous reports@xcite , a 1:3 degeneracy between @xmath11 and @xmath2 was not supported .    utilizing the longer lifetime of the c@xmath12 state@xcite",
    ", the  state has been studied by optical - optical double resonance techniques ( oodr)@xcite . these techniques simplify the spectrum by being sensitive to changes in only a single rovibrational level at a time . in the oodr method , rovibrational selectivity is accomplished by laser multiphoton excitation of a specific j@xmath17 line in the c@xmath12 state .",
    "xie and coworkers@xcite , who were the first to apply this method to  state ammonia , used a second tunable laser to ionize ammonia .",
    "when this second laser was in resonance with a downward c@xmath12 @xmath18  transition from the initially populated level , the ionization signal was depleted .",
    "they reported the nh@xmath0  state 2@xmath19 , 2@xmath9 , and 2@xmath6 bands with both j and k resolution .",
    "they determined the b and c rotational constants for these levels to 0.3 - 0.03  @xmath13 accuracy .",
    "interestingly , these constants agree within experimental error with previous estimates from line shape analysis@xcite .",
    "later , ashfold _",
    "et al._@xcite performed a similar experiment except with fluorescence - dip detection .",
    "they used much lower dump laser power and observed a significant decrease in transition widths demonstrating that the results of xie _",
    "et al._@xcite suffered from significant power broadening .",
    "microwave detected , microwave - optical double resonance ( modr ) has been used to investigate the vibrational overtones of ammonia in the visible region@xcite .",
    "as the oodr techniques previously described , this technique allows one to measure the absorption spectrum of a single rovibrational level at a time .",
    "the principal advantage of this method is that selectivity is based upon the well - known ground state microwave spectrum@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the oodr technique uses the less characterized c@xmath12 state transitions@xcite .",
    "furthermore , predissociation in the c@xmath12 state limits the range of  state rovibronic levels that can be reached .",
    "since the ground state microwave transitions are known for all ammonia isotopomers@xcite , the modr method can be relatively easily extended to the investigation of the entire isotopomeric series . following the completion of this work , endo and",
    "coworkers@xcite reported the use of this technique to the study of the 2@xmath9 level of the nh@xmath0  state .",
    "they reported the homogeneous linewidths and positions of nearly fifty transitions to this band .",
    "our work , even though not as extensive as theirs for this level , confirms their findings .",
    "we have extended this technique to the study of the higher nh@xmath0  state vibronic levels .",
    "in addition , we have applied this technique to the study of the isotopomers nh@xmath1d , nhd@xmath1 , and nd@xmath0 .    in nd@xmath0",
    ", the inversion frequency drops to less than 2 ghz@xcite so that for the investigation of this isotopomer , the identical spectrometer could not be used . in order to investigate the double resonance spectrum of this isotopomer",
    ", we constructed a radio - frequency detected , radio - frequency optical double resonance spectrometer ( rfodr ) similar to the modr spectrometer .",
    "the principal difference between the two instruments was that in the rfodr spectrometer , the waveguide cell was replaced by a strip - line cell that simultaneously allowed the passage of radio - frequency and ultraviolet radiation .",
    "using this cell , we were able to record the rovibrational contours of the 2@xmath19 , 2@xmath9 , and 2@xmath6 bands of the nd@xmath0  state with the same sensitivity that we had with the other isotopomers .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the  transition frequencies we have observed by modr and rfodr for the entire isotopomeric series .",
    "this experiment represents the most extensive spectroscopic investigation of the  state of ammonia conducted to date .",
    "the goals of this study were the following .",
    "first , using the rfodr spectrometer , the resolution in the nd@xmath0 2@xmath9 spectrum was increased such that the centrifugal distortion coefficients for this level were derived .",
    "second , for all isotopomers , precise rotational constants and vibrational term values were derived as a function of @xmath2 . from this data",
    "set , the harmonic force field of the  state was determined .",
    "this newly derived force field leads us to reassign the broad features observed by ashfold _",
    "et al._@xcite in dispersed fluorescence from the c@xmath12 state as due to @xmath20 instead of @xmath11 .",
    "third , with the more extensive rotational data , the vibration - rotation interaction term values were estimated allowing corrections to be obtained for the experimentally determined n - h(d ) equilibrium bond length .",
    "this newly derived experimental estimate for @xmath21 is in excellent agreement with the _ ab initio _ prediction of rosmus _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "and lastly , these modr experiments have allowed us to more accurately model the rotational and vibrational dependence of the transition widths .",
    "this topic will be addressed in the following paper@xcite .",
    "a schematic of the modr spectrometer is shown in figure  [ schematic ] .",
    "this apparatus is similar to that used by coy and lehmann@xcite except that ours does not include a microwave bridge to null the detector .",
    "the bridge increased signal to noise in the earlier work since it allowed for the use of greater ammonia pressure . in the current experiment ,",
    "ammonia pressure was limited by the strong absorption cross section of the  @xmath14 x transition and the need to keep the sample optically thin so as not to distort the observed lineshapes .",
    "the pulsed optical radiation was provided by a xecl excimer pumped dye laser ( questek 2420/ lambda physik 3002e , respectively ) using one of the following two schemes . to generate radiation from 207 nm to 220 nm , output from the dye laser using stilbene 3 ( exciton ) as a gain medium was frequency - doubled in a @xmath22-bbo ( skytek ) cut at @xmath23 ; or , to generate radiation from 197 to 210 nm , the output of rhodamine b ( lambda physik )",
    "was tripled .",
    "tripling was accomplished by first doubling in a kdp crystal using an inrad autotracker ii .",
    "the remaining fundamental and second harmonic (  300 nm ) output of the kdp crystal are orthogonally polarized . to rotate the two beams such that they are parallel polarized",
    ", they are both passed through a 600 nm 0-order half - wave plate that acts as an approximate full waveplate for the second harmonic .",
    "the resulting nearly parallel polarized beams are then sum frequency mixed in the type 1 @xmath22-bbo crystal .",
    "typical ultraviolet power was 50 - 100 @xmath24j per pulse .    in the modr experiments ,",
    "continuous - wave microwave radiation was provided by a series of oki klystrons phaselocked at selected ground state inversion frequencies .",
    "a two meter long wr-42 ( `` p '' band ) waveguide cell was used . at each end of the cell , a 0.020@xmath25 ( 0.51 mm ) thick sapphire window and a specially machined e - plane bend",
    "were mounted .",
    "these bends had a 1/8@xmath25 hole drilled at the zero current line to allow ultraviolet radiation to enter and leave the cell , while the microwave radiation turned the corner .",
    "the cell was internally gold - plated to significantly reduce ammonia adsorption .",
    "the microwave power transmitted through the cell was detected by a schottky - barrier detector diode and recorded by gated boxcar integrator triggered by the pulsed laser .",
    "the ultraviolet and microwave radiation had parallel polarizations .",
    "since the microwave probes were q branch rotation - inversion transitions , polarization effects enhance q branch transitions , and weaken p and r branch transitions compared to the hnl - london line strength factors applicable to absorption from an isotropic sample .",
    "nh@xmath0(matheson , 99.995% ) and nd@xmath0 ( cambridge isotopes , 99.5% ) were used after purification through several freeze pump thaw cycles .",
    "the gas samples were flowed continuously through the cell at a set pressure to avoid depletion of the observed signals caused by photodecomposition .",
    "the mixed isotopes were prepared by combining nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 in the ratios 1:2 and 2:1 to maximize the ratio of nhd@xmath1 and nh@xmath1d , respectively . that the gas samples consisted of a mixture of isotopomers was not a problem since a transition between a single ground state inversion level of a particular isotopomer was selected and monitored by the microwave radiation . in all experiments ,",
    "optimal signals were obtained at pressures between 10 and 70 mtorr .",
    "scanning and calibration of the laser were achieved by conventional methods@xcite . briefly , the transmission of an etalon and the optogalvanic signal from a fe / ne@xcite hollow cathode lamp or the absorption of a @xmath26te@xmath1 cell@xcite were recorded for relative and absolute frequency calibration .",
    "the ultraviolet power was monitored for both signal normalization , and for computer control of the @xmath22-bbo crystal phase matching angle . at the same time , the detected microwave signal was amplified and sent to a gated boxcar integrator .",
    "these four signals were recorded by an ibm at that also stepped the dye laser and maximized the ultraviolet conversion .",
    "when the ultraviolet frequency coincided with a  @xmath14 x transition , the optical pulse created a transient population difference between ground state inversion levels .",
    "the microwave signal is absorptive if the upper state is dpleted by the optical pulse , and emissive if the lower state is depleted .",
    "this is determined by the selectrion rules for the @xmath14x transition .",
    "these rules are that symmetric inversion levels have allowed transitions to even number of quanta in @xmath2 while anti - symmetric inversion levels have allowed transitions to odd number of quanta in @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the detected microwave intensity initially increased or decreased depending whether the final @xmath2 quantum number was even or odd , respectively .",
    "a typical double resonance signal is shown in figure  [ nutation ] . since this signal",
    "was observed through the excitation to the nh@xmath1d 2@xmath19 level , the microwave intensity initially increased .",
    "phase sensitivity was achieved by setting a boxcar gate over the first hump of this rabi nutation .",
    "a representative modr scan is shown in figure  [ representation ] .",
    "the locked microwave frequency was resonant with the nh@xmath0 j@xmath17 = 6@xmath27 inversion doublet as the optical radiation was scanned .",
    "when the ultraviolet frequency was in resonance with the 6@xmath27 line of the  2@xmath8 @xmath14 x 2@xmath19 band , the upper component of the inversion doublet was depleted and a decrease in microwave intensity detected .",
    "further to the blue when the ultraviolet frequency came into resonance with the 6@xmath27 line of the  2@xmath7 @xmath14 x 2@xmath19 band , the lower component of the inversion doublet was depleted and an increase in microwave intensity was detected .",
    "for this particular scan , only the q branches were observed due to the parallel polarization of the two fields and the hnl- london factors , both of which enhance the q over the r branch transition in this case .",
    "the inversion transitions in nd@xmath0 are near 1.6 ghz@xcite , well below the cut off frequency of our modr cell . while in principle",
    ", one could build a cell using much larger waveguide , this would necessarily lead to a very poor overlap of the microwave radiation with the ultraviolet pumped molecules . instead , we constructed a rfodr cell based upon a strip - line cell .",
    "a cross section of the strip - line cell is shown in figure  [ strip_line ] .",
    "the main components of the cell are a 5 @xmath28 5 @xmath28 200 cm aluminum outer body , a 0.8 @xmath28 0.8 @xmath28 200 cm aluminum center conductor , an aluminum ground plane , and two s1-uv windows mounted on flanges at each end of the cell .",
    "the center conductor was held at a fixed distance from the ground plane by kel - f blocks .",
    "originally , the distance (  2 mm ) was chosen to reduce radio - frequency reflections by impedance matching the cell to the source and detector impedance . however , with this spacing , beam divergence and scattering of the ultraviolet light produced a large photoelectron signal from the aluminum strip and ground plane that prevented detection of any double resonance signal . by placing rf hi - pass filters at each end of the cell , adding approximately 100 mtorr sf@xmath27 that acted as an electron scavenger , and doubling the spacing between the center conductor and the ground plane , the anomalous photoelectron signal was reduced to a manageable level . no increase in noise level due to",
    "impedance mismatch was noticed .",
    "radiation for the rfodr spectrometer was produced by a general radio 1218-a unit oscillator .",
    "the rf power was measured by a hp 8473b crystal detector while all other features of the spectrometer are identical to the modr setup previously described .    as will be discussed below",
    ", the lifetime for predissociation from the lowest levels of nd@xmath0 is much longer than those of the other isotopomers . as a result ,",
    "as first shown by douglas@xcite , one observes partial rotational structure even in absorption .",
    "the double resonance data was dominated by high k transitions since the intensity of the radio - frequency probe transition scales as ( k / j(j+1))@xmath6 .",
    "a fluorescence excitation spectrum of the nd@xmath0  state 2@xmath9 band was taken since the p and r branches have the highest hnl - london factors for the low k levels .",
    "the pulsed laser system described in the double resonance experiments was used as the excitation source .",
    "calibration was achieved in an identical fashion .",
    "the output was passed through a 34 cm long , heavily baffled cell in which nd@xmath0 was slowly flowed to maintain a pressure of 0.5 torr .",
    "fluorescence was detected at right angles to the laser propagation direction with an emi 9635qb photomultiplier and boxcar detected .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure  [ nd3lif ] .",
    "the observed peaks were fit by a sum of lorentzians to determine the height , width , and position of each spectral feature .",
    "all transitions were adequately described by a single lorentzian accept those observed in the nh@xmath0 2@xmath7 band .",
    "this system demonstrated a regular asymmetry that prevented a quantitative treatment of these transitions .",
    "the transition frequencies determined from the fits are given in tables [ nh3freqs ] , [ nh2dfreqs ] , [ nhd2freqs ] , and [ nd3freqs ] .",
    "as an example of the quality of the fits , in figure  [ fits ] are presented the calculated and observed transitions for the j@xmath17 = 3@xmath1 rotational level in the nh@xmath0 2@xmath9 band . the observed widths are much larger than the laser bandwidth ( 0.4  @xmath13 ) or the doppler width ( 0.1  @xmath13 ) and are therefore , a direct measure of the predissociation lifetime .",
    "these widths as they relate to the predissociation rates will be presented and discussed in the following paper@xcite .",
    "the transition frequencies for the pure isotopomers , nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 , were fit to a rigid symmetric top spectrum constraining the ground state constants to the literature values . in these fits ,",
    "each observed transition frequency was weighted by the squared uncertainty from the lineshape fits . however , some of the lineshape fits yielded unreasonably small error estimates causing these transitions to be weighted too heavily . to correct this problem , a constant term that reflected systematic errors",
    "was added to the fit uncertainty for each transition frequency included .",
    "this constant was chosen to equate the @xmath29 for the fit to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "fits were then redone with the new weights , and the process iterated until convergence .",
    "the rotational constants determined by this procedure are presented in table [ hfits ] and table [ dfits ] along with previous determinations . where a comparison can be made , our results agree favorably with other reports@xcite . additionally , two more points should be noted .",
    "first , we determine c better than the other rotational constants due to the predominance of high k levels in our data set . and second , the broad transition widths of the hydrogen containing isotopomers limited the accuracy of the experimental transition frequencies .",
    "therefore , in these cases , distortion constants were not included in these fits .",
    "one of the goals of the present work was the determination of the centrifugal distortion constants for the lowest two nd@xmath0 vibronic bands .",
    "at first , a six parameter fit to determine the three distortion constants , d@xmath30 , d@xmath31 , and d@xmath32 , was performed ; results from these fits are given in column 1 of table  [ dfits ] .",
    "the parameters from the fits yielded unphysical values and were moderately correlated .",
    "thus , utilizing relationships among the distortion constants for a planar symmetric top , a five parameter fit to @xmath33 and @xmath34 was also performed and results from these fits are reproduced in column 2 of table  [ dfits ] . a four parameter fit where @xmath34 was constrained to zero was also performed for the 2@xmath9 level as shown in column 3 of table  [ dfits ] .",
    "results from these fits will be further elaborated in the discussion section .",
    "the observed inertial defects for the nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 vibronic levels is given in table  [ defects ] .",
    "these quantities were fit to @xmath35 to determine the dependence on @xmath2 excitation .",
    "the determined values for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are also presented in table  [ defects ] .",
    "these values were used in the fits of the mixed isotopomer data as discussed below .",
    "the transition frequencies for the mixed isotopomers was fit to a rigid asymmetric top spectrum . due to the limited number of observed transitions for these two species ,",
    "all three rotational constants could not be determined independently . to improve these fits , we constrain the calculated inertial defect for the two mixed isotopomers to lie between the values observed for the two pure isotopomers . as an example for the nh@xmath1 2@xmath9 level , we constrain the inertial defect to the following",
    ", @xmath38 b and c were independently varied while a was constrained to reproduce this calculated inertial defect .",
    "the determined values from these fits are presented in table  [ hfits ] .    from the fit of the rfodr data on nd@xmath0",
    ", we obtained preliminary rotational constants for the 2@xmath9 band . using these constants , including estimates for the j , k dependence of the width to be discussed in the following paper@xcite ,",
    "the fluorescence excitation spectrum of the 2@xmath9 band was simulated .",
    "this procedure allowed assignment of many of the strong features in the excitation spectrum , particularly the p branch .",
    "these assigned lines were used in the final refinement of the rotational constants of the 2@xmath9 band .",
    "the simulation of the 2@xmath9 band , using the final constants , is overlaid with the experimental spectrum in figure  [ nd3lif ] .",
    "in the previous  state ammonia work , there have been substantial differences in the experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite determinations of the  state equilibrium bond length .",
    "the resolution of this controversy was one of the primary goals of the present work . using the modr technique ,",
    "rotational constants were obtained for all the vibronic bands studied . given the @xmath39 planar equilibrium structure of the  state@xcite , there is only one structural parameter , the n ",
    "h equilibrium bond length , which in principle could be determined from the b or c rotational constants .",
    "the effective bond lengths derived through the b rotational constant data varied considerably , likely due to significant vibration - rotation interactions induced by b axis rotation .",
    "the effective bond lengths obtained from the c rotational constants showed less variation .",
    "hence , we have estimated the equilibrium bond lengths by attempting to correct for the smaller vibration - rotation interactions in the observed c rotational constants .    for the two pure isotopomers , we used the fitted rotational constants in the @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=1 vibronic levels to calculate @xmath40 . for nh@xmath0 , @xmath40 was determined to be -0.07(5 )  @xmath13 while for nd@xmath0 it was -0.036(8 )  @xmath13 .",
    "these values were used to correct for vibration - rotation effects caused by @xmath2 excitation .",
    "after correction for this motion , an averaged bond length , @xmath41 , was calculated for both species . for nh@xmath0 , @xmath41 was determined to be 1.082(3 )   while for nd@xmath0 it was 1.074(1 )  .",
    "for the remaining modes , @xmath42 should essentially scale as the inverse square root of the reduced mass@xcite .",
    "for these two bands , the effects of the bend - stretch fermi resonance ( which is responsible for the rapid rise in the dissociation rate for levels with @xmath43 ) does not play a significant role .",
    "thus , assuming the reduced mass of the remaining modes is dominated by h(d ) , we can extrapolate the above @xmath41 values for nh@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 to yield a value for @xmath21 of 1.055(8 )   .",
    "this result is in quantitative agreement with the _ ab initio _ value determined by rosmus and co - workers@xcite , and confirms their suggestion that the apparent disagreement between theory and experiment was due to the neglect of vibration - rotation interactions in deducing the bond length from the accurately determined rotational constants of douglas@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that douglas pointed out that his estimated bond length had an unknown uncertainty , but this caveat was dropped in almost all subsequent references to this ` experimental ' bond length .",
    "another goal of the present work was the experimental determination of the  state harmonic force constants .",
    "there exist _ ab initio _ estimates of a few of these constants@xcite , but none have been experimentally determined .",
    "due to the redundancy condition on the in - plane angles , the in - plane force field is described by only four constants , @xmath5 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . the out - of - plane force field is described by a single force constant , @xmath3 . to first order , two of these force constants , @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath46 , would only split the mode frequencies .",
    "furthermore , assuming these constants to be reasonably close to the values of the electronic ground state@xcite , we anticipate these to be small and have little effect on the observed frequencies .",
    "in fact , comparison of the q@xmath47 and r(nh ) _ ab initio _ potentials of mccarthy _",
    "et al._@xcite predict that @xmath44 is less than 0.1  aj / @xmath6 .",
    "initially , we take these force constants to be zero leaving only three force constants to be determined .",
    "we had hoped that we could use the centrifugal distortion constants to help determine the harmonic force field .",
    "for both the nd@xmath0 2@xmath19 and 2@xmath9 bands , we have accurately determined the rotational constants as well as the centrifugal distortion constants , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to use the same procedure to determine the centrifugal distortion constants for the 2@xmath6 band due to the larger observed transition widths .",
    "we note that for a planar symmetric top , the centrifugal distortion constants are related by@xcite @xmath51 the fits were constrained to obey this relationship .",
    "the centrifugal distortion constants are related to the force constants by@xcite : @xmath52_{e } f_{ij}^{-1}[j_{xx}^{(j)}]_{e } \\label{taux}\\ ] ] @xmath53 where @xmath54_{e}=\\delta i_{xx}/\\delta q_{i}$ ] at the equilibrium geometry .",
    "our observed transition frequencies were then used to determine @xmath33 and @xmath34 for all three bands .",
    "these values are also included in table  [ dfits ] .",
    "the @xmath33 values listed in table  [ dfits ] for the 2@xmath9 and 2@xmath6 bands implies a negative value for @xmath55 .",
    "this result is clearly unphysical .",
    "in addition , @xmath5 from equation 2 for the 2@xmath9 level , was calculated to be only 0.73 aj/  @xmath6 .",
    "this value is in sharp disagreement with both the _ ab initio _ value and as discussed later , the value obtained by consideration of the observed zero point energies .",
    "we have clearly determined anomalous centrifugal distortion constants .",
    "anomalous centrifugal distortion constants often arise when a vibrational state is perturbed by a nearby level .",
    "in the present case , no such level appears available .",
    "for the 2@xmath9 level , @xmath33 appears to be poorly determined .",
    "however , in a fit without distortion constants , all the low j transitions have positive residuals while all the high j transitions have negative residuals .",
    "@xmath48 must certainly be negative !",
    "therefore , the centrifugal distortion constants obtained can not be used to derive physically meaningful harmonic force constants .",
    "the determination of the harmonic force field had to be obtained in a less direct manner . from the observed @xmath2 vibrational progressions ,",
    "we determine the out - of - plane bending force constant , @xmath3 .",
    "since the higher members of the @xmath2 progression are broad and erratically spaced@xcite , we use only the data from the 2@xmath19 , 2@xmath9 , and 2@xmath6 band systems . from these levels for each of our isotopomers , @xmath2 and x@xmath56 were determined .",
    "these values are presented in table  [ observed_freqs ] .",
    "since the x@xmath56 values are small , the @xmath2 frequencies are expected to scale as the inverse square of the reduced mass@xcite . however , as the reduced mass is increased , the effective force constants systematically decrease ; the force constant obtained from the nd@xmath0 progression underestimates the nh@xmath0 @xmath2 fundamental frequency by approximately 40  @xmath13 .",
    "we were able to still reasonably estimate @xmath3 at 1.06(4 ) aj/  @xmath6 , nearly double the _ ab initio _ value of 0.66 aj/  @xmath6@xcite .",
    "next , the in - plane force constant , @xmath57 , was determined .",
    "we can use the observed inertial defects to estimate this force constant .",
    "the inertial defect , @xmath58 , is given for the 2@xmath19 , 2@xmath9 , and 2@xmath6 vibronic levels for the two pure isotopomers in table  [ defects ] .",
    "we assume that the centrifugal and electronic contributions to the inertial defect are small in comparison to the vibrational contribution and neglect their effect entirely .",
    "therefore , the inertial defect was fit to@xcite : @xmath59 + \\sum_{t}\\frac{h}{\\pi^{2}c}\\frac{3}{2\\omega_{t}}(\\nu_{t}+\\frac{1}{2 } ) .",
    "\\label{inertial}\\ ] ] this inertial defect depends principally upon @xmath2 and @xmath60 and only very weakly on the other modes . since @xmath2 has already been accurately determined , analysis of the inertial defect should be a sensitive method to determine @xmath45 . using the _ ab initio _",
    "value for @xmath5 of 5.09 aj/  @xmath6@xcite , and our calculated value for @xmath3 , we fit to the observed inertial defects and determine @xmath45 to be 0.25(2 ) aj .",
    "the calculated inertial defects are also included in table  [ defects ] for comparison .",
    "it should be mentioned that this value for @xmath4 is significantly lower than the ground state value of 0.68 aj/  @xmath6@xcite .",
    "changing the assumed value of @xmath5 by  20% changes the calculated inertial defect by @xmath610.5% .",
    "the calculated inertial defects demonstrated systematic errors from the observed nd@xmath0 values . even changing the @xmath3 force constant considerably while varying @xmath45",
    "could not reproduce the large positive inertial defect we observed for the nd@xmath0 2@xmath19 level . in our approach",
    ", we have neglected centrifugal contributions to the inertial defect .",
    "this contribution is given by@xcite @xmath62 this contribution is predicted to be on the order of @xmath63 and far too small to explain our large deviation from the observed values .",
    "we suggest that perturbations in this level are causing @xmath64 to be anomalously large such that the centrifugal contributions to the inertial defect are much larger than predicted . however , since the observed inertial defects for nh@xmath0 are well reporduced as well as the relative spacings for the nd@xmath0 levels , we feel that our determined value for @xmath45 is reasonably close to the true value .",
    "now we turn attention to the perturbation observed in the nh@xmath0 2@xmath7 band .",
    "it had been suggested that this asymmetry reflected a partially resolved structure built off one quantum in the @xmath11 mode@xcite ; thus , the 2@xmath7 band system would be overlapped by the 1@xmath92@xmath9 band system .",
    "the 2@xmath7 and 1@xmath92@xmath9 vibronic levels have opposite symmetry with respect to reflection in the plane , and thus can not interact through anharmonic interactions .",
    "furthermore , the 1@xmath92@xmath9 assignment can be ruled out by the phase of the observed modr signals .",
    "transitions to the 2@xmath7 level originate from symmetric levels in the ground electronic state ( leading to an initial emission of the microwave radiation ) while transitions to the 1@xmath92@xmath9 level arise from asymmetric levels ( leading to absorption ) .",
    "thus , the phase of the modr signal from these two transitions would have opposite signs . since the observed asymmetry in the 2@xmath7 modr spectrum was the same as in absorption",
    ", this asymmetry is not the result of the 1@xmath92@xmath9 band .",
    "the observation of this asymmetry implies a coupling of the @xmath2 mode that is greater than its coupling with the dissociative continuum .",
    "if the mode attributable to this perturbation were either of the stretching modes , the dissociation rate from the quasibound state would have been enhanced greatly ; hence , broader lines would have been expected than what we observed .",
    "the only other mode that could be responsible for the observed perturbation is due to @xmath60 , the degenerate in - plane bending mode . using the above value for @xmath45",
    "we predict that the harmonic frequency for @xmath60 is 1114  @xmath13 .",
    "we assign the observed perturbation of the 2@xmath7 level to an anharmonic mixing with the a@xmath47 component of the 4@xmath8 levelnad thus , the two levels are brought into resonance assuming @xmath60 = 1114  @xmath13 and x@xmath65 = 25  @xmath13 .",
    "we have neglected the contribution of g@xmath65 for lack of data .",
    "the 4@xmath8 level has a harmonic amplitude of @xmath15 43 degrees so we would expect a substantial positive anharmonic correction due to the steric repulsion of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "we are then left with only one force constant , @xmath5 , to determine . to estimate this force constant",
    ", we use our observed isotopic shifts in band origins .",
    "this shift results from changes in vibrational zero point energy due to isotopic substitution .",
    "we assume the harmonic approximation and use , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the observed 0 - 0 band origin for a given isotopomer , @xmath68 is the energy difference between the two potential surface minima , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the zero point energies for the  and x states respectively .",
    "@xmath70 is taken from the _ ab initio _ work of hargiss and ermler@xcite while @xmath67 was known for each of our isotopomers .",
    "constraining @xmath68 to be constant and utilizing our determined values for the other  state force constants , @xmath5 was varied to reproduce the observed band origins for the two pure isotopomers .",
    "we then used the @xmath67 values for the mixed isotopomers as a consistency check . using this procedure , @xmath5 was determined to be 4.2 aj/  @xmath6 while @xmath68 was found at 48070  @xmath13 .",
    "the determined value for @xmath5 is approximately 80% of the value determined by rosmus and coworkers@xcite .",
    "we attribute this discrepancy to a neglect of anharmonicity in the excited state potential . in order to estimate these effects",
    ", we use the _ ab initio _",
    "values for x@xmath71 = -236  @xmath13 and x@xmath72 = -118  @xmath13 and correct for the anharmonicity of the excited state .",
    "after this correction , @xmath5 was readjusted to 4.9 aj/  @xmath6 in better agreement with the it ab initio results@xcite .",
    "our estimated values of the force constants , @xmath68 , and the vibrational frequencies for all four isotopomers are presented in table  [ calculated_freqs ] .    to estimate any effect due to the neglect of @xmath73 and @xmath44 on",
    "the observed zero point energies , we insert these into the above calculations and redetermine our @xmath68 and @xmath5 values . inclusion of @xmath44 at its ground state value of 0.31 aj/  @xmath6 changes the calculated @xmath68 values by a uniform 14  @xmath13 .",
    "likewise , addition of @xmath73 at its ground state value of -0.176 aj increases @xmath68 by a uniform 20  @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the neglect of these two force constants has little effect on our calculated values for @xmath5 and @xmath68 .",
    "in addition , increasing @xmath5 by 0.1 aj/  @xmath6 changes @xmath68(nh@xmath0 ) - @xmath68(nd@xmath0 ) by 14  @xmath13 . hence , this method is a sensitive measure of the @xmath5 force constant .",
    "given the above sensitivities to unknown potential parameters , we suggest that @xmath68 = 48070  @xmath15  200  @xmath13",
    ". the _ ab initio _",

    "determined values@xcite .",
    "these values are about 500  @xmath13 higher than the values assigned to the fundamentals through dispersed fluorescence from the c@xmath12 state@xcite . while the anharmonic corrections to the fundamental frequency are quite large , the @xmath11 fundamental is above the barrier to dissociation along one n ",

    ", we had hoped that a progression built from this mode could be directly observed in the fluorescence excitation spectrum of nd@xmath0 . while this level is not franck - condon active , the large coriolis interaction between modes @xmath2 and @xmath60 predicted by the above force field will give intensity to the upper j levels of the 4@xmath9 band .",
    "however , in the expected region , an overlapping @xmath2 hot band transition made direct observation of this mode difficult . still an extremely weak and broad transition lying approximately 815  @xmath13 above the band origin was observed in the wings of the hot band transition that we have assigned to the @xmath60 mode .",
