    "unfortunately , despite recent progress,@xcite direct fabrication of such materials using top - down approaches can be technologically challenging , expensive , and time - consuming .",
    "an alternative bottom - up strategy is to synthesize systems of nanoscale particles with effective interactions@xcite that favor spontaneous or directed self - assembly into the targeted structure ( e.g. , a periodic crystal or superlattice configuration).@xcite    historically , design in self assembly has focused on _ forward _ approaches , whereby the interactions between particles are altered in some rationally - guided or edisonian fashion , and the resulting equilibrium structures that such interactions produce are identified and catalogued according to their ability to meet various design goals concerning their material properties .",
    "however , attention has begun to shift toward _ inverse _ design strategies , whereby interactions that favor the targeted structure or properties in the thermodynamically stable state are formally discovered through a constrained , statistical mechanical optimization.@xcite    several recently introduced computational methods for inverse design focus on optimization of interparticle interactions to stabilize a targeted ground - state configuration with the assumption of an isotropic pair potential @xmath0 with variable parameter set @xmath1 .",

    "one basic question that has not yet been addressed is , which features of a pair potential would tend to maximize the melting temperature of a given target structure ?",
    "moreover , how would encoding high thermal stability into the interactions affect the corresponding range of densities for which the target structure is favored ?",
    "in other words , is there a natural compromise between designing for robustness to changes in temperature versus volume ?",
    "such questions are challenging to answer directly via inverse methods because they would require incorporating full molecular simulations ( for a wide range of model parameters and thermodynamic conditions ) into the optimization problem , which is computationally unfeasible at present .",
    "a pragmatic alternative is to search for features of the ground - state behavior that , while easier to compute than higher temperature properties , correlate with thermal stability of the target phase . in the present work",

    "following other works ,  @xcite we adopt the latter fixed pressure framework for our optimizations for convenience because any coexistence between the target structure and another lattice also requires equality of pressure between phases . through our optimizations",
    ", we test how the maximum achievable range of density for stability of the square - lattice ground state is affected by constraining the differences between its chemical potential at a prescribed state point and those of selected competing lattice structures at the same pressure . to do this",
    "systematically requires the solution of a series of optimization problems , each utilizing different constraints .",
    "given the considerable computational expense of using stochastic optimizers ( e.g. , simulated annealing , genetic algorithms , etc . ) for even a single optimization , we instead formulate each optimization problem of interest as a constrained mixed - integer nonlinear problem , and we solve it numerically using the general algebraic modeling system ( gams)@xcite .",
    "we then explore the consequences of our imposed chemical potential advantage of the target ground state for the resulting thermal stability ( i.e. , melting temperature ) of the resulting lattices .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the computational methods used for carrying out the pair - potential optimization and the melting point estimation .",
    "next , we show the relationship between the density range of ground - state stability for the target lattice and the minimum chemical potential difference between the target and selected competitors .",

    "( i.e. the heaviside function ) as well as the remaining non - linear functions present in the potential and system physics formulation .    in practice",

    "if the maximum attainable value of @xmath20 is realized in the optimization ( i.e the maximum number of feasible density points @xmath59 is achieved ) , the boundaries of the density range are widened and the previously attained potential is used as the initial guess for a new optimization .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the optimization returns @xmath60 , indicating that the maximum density range of stability for a given chemical potential constraint @xmath53 was attained in the previous optimization .",
    "we carry out the optimizations described above for different values of @xmath53 to explore how an imposed chemical potential advantage of the target lattice affects the maximum attainable @xmath61 .",
    "as discussed in the results section , there is a maximum value of @xmath53 above which a feasible solution does not seem to exist for any density range . while found values are not verifiably global due to the local nature of the optimizer , they are optimal to the best of our efforts .",
    "in addition to the explicit constraints described above , only pair potentials that result in mechanically stable target ground - state structures ( as determined from phonon spectra analysis ) were considered .",
    "spontaneous assembly of particles interacting via the optimized potentials from the fluid state into the target structure upon temperature quenching was also verified at @xmath54 using monte carlo simulations ( see supplemental material ) .      in our previous work on inverse design of targeted lattices,@xcite we sought pair potentials that simply maximized the density range of stability of the desired structure ( @xmath56 ) . for that type of optimization , it was necessary to choose a finite pool of competitive structures to compare with the target lattice , ideally those with the lowest values of chemical potential at the pressures of interest ( which are not generally known in advance ) .",
    "we determined the composition of this competitive pool from an iterative procedure .",
    "an initial set of structures was selected ( e.g. , bravais lattices plus a small number of non - bravais lattices or tilings ) based on intuition and knowledge obtained from earlier simulation studies on similar pair potentials .",
    "an optimization was then performed using the chosen competitive pool , followed by a forward calculation of the ground - state phase diagram with the optimized pair potential for densities in the targeted range .",
    "any new structures that appeared were subsequently added to the previous competitive pool , and a second optimization with the updated list of competitive structures was completed . this process  updating the competitive pool and optimizing the pair potential considering the expanded list of possible lattices found in forward calculations  was repeated until no new competing lattice structures emerged .    in the present study ,",
    "we repeat similar optimizations but with the added requirement of a minimum chemical potential difference between the target and selected competitors .",
    "the hypothesis is that such a constraint will find potentials displaying enhanced thermal stability of the targeted phase .",
    "note that one can not enforce a fixed chemical potential difference between the target lattice and _ all _ possible competitors . to understand why , consider a representation of lattice structure defined by a set of primitive and basis vectors @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath62 can be modified continuously in some way ( without adding or removing particles ) , e.g. , by a set of suitable parameters @xmath63 , then @xmath64 will then define a hyperspace of continuously connected lattices with the target structure @xmath21 representing a specific point in this space . for ground - state systems of a given pair potential at a specific pressure , state quantities such as @xmath14 depend on the lattice structure ( i.e. @xmath65 ) such that @xmath14 itself can be represented as a hypersurface of continuously connected lattices @xmath66 .",
    "thus , one can always find structures in the neighborhood of the target lattice on the hypersurface with chemical potentials arbitrarily close to that of the target .    considering this ,",
    "it is clear that one can not enforce a nonzero minimum chemical potential difference @xmath53 between the target and _ all _ possible competitive structures .",
    "however , one can meaningfully constrain the @xmath14 hypersurface in the optimization by enforcing a minimum chemical potential difference @xmath53 between the target and a chosen set of lattices @xmath67 that define ` flag points ' on the landscape .",
    "this helps achieve a standardized and well defined constraint depth that is feasible for the optimization .",
    "indeed , a similar approach was introduced by zhang et al for a related @xmath68 optimization and justified under similar premises.@xcite    we provide an example for concreteness .",
    "the chosen target square lattice can be represented as a point in a larger bravais subspace spanned by oblique primitive vectors @xmath69 with @xmath63 consisting of an aspect ratio @xmath70 and primitive vector angle @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the square lattice is represented by @xmath72 , while other bravais lattices like the triangular lattice are given by @xmath73 and so on .",
    "the corresponding @xmath65 landscape of this bravais subset is then a function of @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath75 ) . as such , the flag - point lattices we choose for enforcing the depth constraints here are the triangular lattice and a rectangular lattice which capture independent variations along the @xmath71 and @xmath70 directions in the neighborhood of the target ( for an illustration of the resulting bravais chemical potential landscape from one of the optimized potentials see figure 1s).@xcite similar subspace arguments can be made to account for elongated triangular ( et ) and snub - square ( ss ) non - bravais lattices , where the former can be transformed into square by a row - shift and the latter by a rotation of a single tile around its next neighboring square tiles . other tilings or non - bravais lattices",
    "can , in principle , be important for target lattice stability , but we did not find others that were relevant in the present square - lattice design problem .    given the above considerations , our final competing pool consisted of lattices determined from the iterative forward procedure , some of which ( those which naturally belonged to a subspace that continuously deformed into the square lattice ) were also chosen as flag - point lattices . from the bravais subspace , the final competing pool consisted of triangular , rectangular ( rec ) @xmath76 , and oblique ( obl ) @xmath77 , @xmath78 lattices , with triangular and rec also serving as flag points for the chemical potential constraint .",
    "similarly , for the other relevant non - bravais subspaces , the competitive pool included one ss lattice ( @xmath79 ) and three et lattices ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) , with all but the last et lattice serving as flag points for the chemical potential constraint .",
    "the z - method is a microcanonical molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation strategy for estimating the melting point of a crystal that does not require free energy calculations.@xcite the approach is based on the idea that a crystal remains metastable upon raising the temperature until it reaches its superheating limit , where it is hypothesized to have the same internal energy as the liquid at the equilibrium melting temperature @xmath83 .",
    "the name is due to the fact that the estimate comes from the z - shaped ( zig - zag ) graph that one observes for the system in the temperature @xmath84 vs pressure @xmath85 plane as it transforms from the solid phase upon raising the energy at constant volume .",
    "it has been applied for a variety of model systems and has been repeatedly tested for both accuracy and variability.@xcite for our purposes here , where we seek only estimates of melting temperatures to compare the widely varying thermal stabilities of targeted assemblies designed under various constraints , the z - method provides an adequate guide .",
    "energy sweeps for the z - method are carried out as follows .",
    "initial particle positions are set in a perfect square lattice , and initial velocities are chosen from a random distribution and scaled to achieve a desired initial kinetic energy . for a series of progressively increasing energies , microcanonical",
    "md simulation trajectories of @xmath86 particles ( and a periodic square cell of length @xmath87 chosen to set @xmath88 ) are initiated with a time step value of @xmath89 .",
    "after an initial pre - equilibration period at each energy , averages of static quantities like temperature @xmath84 and pressure @xmath85 are taken every @xmath90 time steps for at least @xmath91 steps .",
    "near the transition region , averages for liquid and solid properties are taken separately with the phase being determined by the translational order parameter @xmath92 @xmath93 here , @xmath94 denotes particle positions vectors and @xmath95 is a reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "we chose @xmath96 for this purpose , where @xmath35 denotes the lattice constant value at density @xmath97 .",
    "we use @xmath98 to indicate solid configurations and @xmath99 to denote liquid configurations .",
    "these assignments were additionally supported by monitoring the mean square displacement of the particles as a function of time .    reported estimates of @xmath83 are averages of the temperature of the superheating limit of the solid obtained from twelve independent energy sweeps .",
    "as further corroboration of the estimates obtained from the z - method described above , we also carry out melting point estimations by the hysteresis method .",
    "this method is based on analysis of superheating and supercooling processes in the framework of nucleation theory and validated through molecular dynamics simulations.@xcite the basic approach is to carry out a simple heating and cooling sweep of the system near the melting point to determine the temperature of superheating @xmath100 and supercooling @xmath101 .",
    "the melting point @xmath83 is then estimated from @xmath102 as such , we carry out monte carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble for @xmath103 particles in a periodic square cell of length @xmath87 adjusted to fix density at @xmath88 .",

    "we illustrate these points by plotting @xmath116 for optimized interactions corresponding to the limiting cases of strongly ( @xmath113 ) and weakly ( @xmath109 ) constrained chemical potential advantage of the square lattice ground state over the flag point structures .",

    "the potential shape trends obtained from optimizations with the high @xmath68 constraint described above can be contrasted to the muted features that manifest when a smaller @xmath68 constraint is applied ( which leads to considerably larger @xmath61 ) . shown in figure",

    "the specific shape that provided great chemical potential advantage for the square lattice at @xmath54 is no longer able to favor the structure at even modestly lower or higher densities .",
    "in contrast , the slower varying form of @xmath116 for the @xmath120 system , while providing reduced chemical potential advantage at @xmath54 , is able to keep the square lattice stable over a wider density range .",
    "the inverse relationship in figure [ fig : drhovsdmu ] emerges as a natural consequence of this trade off .     as a function of the minimum chemical potential advantage @xmath105 of the square lattice ground state at @xmath54 over the flag - point lattices at that pressure .",

    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : tmvsdmu ] , the potentials optimized with larger @xmath68 constraints also show higher @xmath83 irrespective of the estimation method . for instance",
    ", while the @xmath68=0.01 system has a melting point at around @xmath83=0.02 , the melting point for the @xmath68=0.23 potential is approximately @xmath83=0.2an order of magnitude greater .",
    "a slightly more pronounced but largely similar result is found from the hysteresis method ( @xmath122 to @xmath123 at @xmath109 to @xmath113 respectively ) .",
    "considering the @xmath116 analysis presented above , this trend makes intuitive sense .",
    "potentials designed with larger @xmath105 constraints impose greater penalties to target lattice deformation , and hence a higher average energy is required to move particles from their perfect lattice positions .",
    "this apparently translates directly to a higher melting point for the structure .",
    "a similar argument can be made based on the discussion of the @xmath14 hypersurface in the methods section .",
    "since @xmath68 captures an effective ` well depth ' for the target structure , imposing higher @xmath68 has the effect of creating greater ` restoring forces ' on the target ( i.e. higher eigenvalues of the @xmath14 hessian).@xcite this results in increased mechanical stability at the ground state and a correspondingly higher melting point as shown here .",
    "finally , an important question arises when comparing back to figure [ fig : drhovsdmu ] .",
    "since we probed the melting points along a path where both ` range ' ( @xmath61 ) and ` depth ' ( @xmath105 ) change simultaneously , how does @xmath83 change if we hold a particular depth constant and vary the range , or vice versa ? from our discussion",
    "so far , we expect that depth alone will determine the thermal trend while the range will be largely inconsequential . indeed , test runs where we probed systems with the same depth but different ranges yielded scatter around a mean value , whereas holding range constant and varying depth produced melting points consistent with [ fig : tmvsdmu ] ( not shown ) .",
    "thus , for our inverse optimized pair potential , @xmath68 of the target in the ground state appears to strongly correlate with the thermal stability of the assembly , while the corresponding density range of stability has no such clear connection to the melting temperature .",
    "we have used inverse methods of statistical mechanics to gain new insights into the trade - off between designing interactions for stability of a target structure with respect to changes in temperature versus density .",
    "specifically , we have explored the consequences of constraining the minimum chemical potential advantage of a target square lattice ground state at a prescribed density @xmath54 over select competitors ( @xmath68 or ` depth ' on the @xmath14 landscape ) while designing potentials that maximize the range of density where the target ground state is stable ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the resulting constrained nonlinear optimization problem was solved numerically . for the isotropic ,",
    "convex - repulsive pair interactions considered here , pair potentials designed with a larger @xmath105 constraint exhibited a narrower range of density stability @xmath61 .",
    "the reasons for this compromise are apparent when examining the radially - dependent forms of the optimized pair potentials and their gradients .",
    "to enable high stability at a given density , features in the potential and its derivative must align with specific coordination shells to help produce the desired differences in chemical potential .",
    "when such features are present , however , the resulting target structures can lose stability with even modest changes in density .",
    "we have also verified , via md and monte carlo simulations , that potentials exhibiting ground states designed with larger @xmath105 constraints have higher melting temperatures at the target density .",
    "preliminary tests further suggests that it is @xmath105 alone , and not @xmath61 , that correlates with @xmath83 .",
    "both results are in accord with the idea that @xmath105 constraints ensure restoring forces on the @xmath14 hypersurface that resist deformation ( and ultimately melting ) of the target structure .",
