    "asymmetry is common among planetary nebulae ( pne ) and it comes in a large variety of shapes and morphological features . on a large scale ,",
    "the departure from symmetry goes from the mild asymmetry of elliptical pne to the strong asymmetry displayed by bipolar pne .",
    "asymmetry in pne is also revealed by an assortment of small - scale morphological features including the symmetric fast low - ionization emission regions ( fliers ) of elliptical pne , as well as point - symmetric collimated outflows and their associated blowouts and bow - shock structures .",
    "the asymmetry in pne has been linked on many occasions to binarity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there is no conclusive evidence supporting such connection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . on the contrary , the onset of bipolarity in pne seems to require the evolution of a massive progenitor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "pne that show asymmetric structures along different directions are of great importance , as the change in the direction of the ejection can be associated with the precession of the progenitor star in a binary system .",
    "this class of pne is not homogeneous at all , and includes pne with multiple collimated outflows along different directions @xcite or with precessing jet - like features @xcite , starfish - shaped and multipolar pne that show point - symmetric bow - shock features @xcite , and quadrupolar and polypolar pne with different sets of bipolar lobes aligned along different symmetry axes @xcite .",
    "polypolar and quadrupolar pne are especially interesting as multiple hourglass structures imply recurrent bipolar ejections which are particularly difficult to interpret in the framework of the interacting stellar wind model @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing pne with multiple bipolar lobes is ngc6881 .",
    "originally classified as a quadrupolar pn , based on optical narrowband images and long - slit echelle spectra @xcite , ngc6881 presents two pairs of highly collimated bipolar lobes with very similar , although not coincident , symmetry axes .",
    "the southwest lobe displays a loop - like feature that is highly reminiscent of a precessing collimated outflow , but its measured expansion velocity is low .",
    "@xcite showed that the dense equatorial ring has recently changed its orientation , being aligned with the youngest pair of bipolar lobes .    therefore , there are many signs suggesting that precession and sequential events of bipolar ejections have occurred in ngc6881",
    ". the spatial distribution of the molecular hydrogen in this nebula , as revealed by near - ir narrowband h@xmath0 ( 10 ) s(1 ) images @xcite , adds a new twist .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission is detected in wide hourglass bipolar lobes that extend much farther than the ionized bipolar lobes .",
    "the h@xmath0 bipolar lobes may represent a bipolar ejection unrelated to the formation of the two pairs of ionized bipolar lobes .    to study carefully the spatial distributions of ionized material and molecular hydrogen in ngc6881 and to investigate the excitation mechanism of the h@xmath0 molecule throughout the nebula",
    ", we have obtained new h@xmath0 , br@xmath1 , [ n  ii ] , and h@xmath2 images , and @xmath4 intermediate - resolution long - slit spectroscopic observations .",
    "a description of the observations is presented in @xmath52 and the results are given in @xmath53 .",
    "the results are discussed in @xmath54 , and the conclusions and a short summary are presented in @xmath55 .",

    "line identifications are overlaid on the spectra . ]",
    "the long - slit spectra of ngc6881 detect continuum emission from the innermost regions and extended line emission all through the nebula .",
    "a preliminary inspection of the two - dimensional spectra reveals the variation at different locations of the nebula of important line ratios ( e.g. h@xmath0 1@xmath90 s(1)/br@xmath1 , he  i / he  ii ) , in agreement with the different spatial distribution of emission shown by the br@xmath1 and h@xmath0 images .",
    "guided by these images , we have extracted spectra from four individual regions : the central region , the ionized lobes , the h@xmath0-dominated hourglass lobes , and the northwest h@xmath0 lobe extension . the @xmath10 spectra of these regions are shown in figure  [ fig5 ] , and the @xmath4 spectra of the ionized lobes in figure  [ fig6 ] . within our limited spectral resolution ,",
    "the radial velocity derived for the different regions is similar .",
    "the measured line intensities are listed in table  3 and 4 .",
    "the spectra and line ratios confirm that the central region is br@xmath1-dominated , the ionized lobes show h@xmath0/br@xmath1 @xmath11 1 , and the outermost regions are h@xmath0-dominated .",
    "he  ii emission is confined to the central region , while the outermost regions show a wealth of h@xmath0 lines .",
    "we note that the spectrum from the ionized lobes is most likely contaminated by emission from the h@xmath0-dominated hourglass lobes .",
    "the molecule of h@xmath0 can be excited by shocks or by uv fluorescence .",
    "the 10 s(1)/21 s(1 ) line ratio is traditionally used to diagnose the h@xmath0 excitation mechanism , with a line ratio @xmath112 implying uv fluorescence @xcite , and a line ratio @xmath1110 implying shock excitation @xcite .",
    "the 10 s(1)/ 21 s(1 ) line ratio in the different regions of ngc6881 ranges from 5.5 up to 7.5 , thus indicating that shock excitation can be the most likely dominant excitation mechanism .    in a case of pure collisional excitation ,",
    "the population of the energy levels of the h@xmath0 molecule are described by a single - temperature boltzmann distribution . to verify this statement , the excitation diagrams for several regions of ngc6881 ( figure  [ fig7 ] )",
    "have been calculated using a boltzmann distribution of states where the column densities are related to the @xmath12=1 , @xmath13=3 state by @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the statistical weights .",
    "this equation can be rearranged in terms of the flux @xmath17 where @xmath18 represent the transition probability , and @xmath19 is the observed flux at frequency @xmath20 .",
    "the temperature can be inferred from the slope of the line fitted to the data points in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in ngc6881 ,",
    "the value of the vibrational excitation temperature , @xmath21(@xmath12 ) , is similar to this of the rotational excitation temperature , @xmath21(@xmath13 ) , and thus it can be concluded that shocks are the dominant excitation mechanism of h@xmath0 .",
    "the excitation temperature is 2100 k for the central region , 2200@xmath22100  k for the ionized and h@xmath0 lobes , and 2700@xmath22100  k for the extension of the nw h@xmath0 lobe .",
    "there is thus , a trend for the temperature to increase as we move farther from the central regions of ngc6881 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission of bipolar pne is typically found in their equatorial rings and on the walls of their bipolar lobes , outlining closely the distribution of ionized material shown in h@xmath2 or [ n  ii ] images @xcite . in ngc6881 , however , the different spatial distributions of ionized material and molecular hydrogen trace distinct nebular structures .",
    "a search in the literature shows that there are very few cases of bipolar pne and proto - pne in which the h@xmath0 and h@xmath2 or [ n  ii ] morphologies are different : crl2688 , m2 - 9 , ngc2440 , ngc7027 , j900 , and hb12 . from this short list , ngc2440 has to be discarded as recent _ hst _ images ( proposal i d .",
    "11090 ) have shown that the h@xmath0 arc seen by @xcite follows the outermost h@xmath2 emission . in crl2688 ( the egg nebula ) , the h@xmath0 emission is distributed along the equatorial plane and at the tips of the bipolar lobes seen in scattered light @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 bipolar lobes of m2 - 9 envelop the bipolar lobes seen in emission lines of ionized species such as fe  ii @xcite .",
    "the four - lobed shell of h@xmath0 in ngc7072 surrounds its elliptical ionized core , revealing the location of a photodissociation region ( pdr ) that is excited by the absorption of uv photons @xcite . in j900",
    ", the h@xmath0 emission shows a linear structure extending @xmath1140  that ends in an arc - like structure @xcite .",
    "this feature has been suggested to be caused by uv excitation of stellar radiation that leaks out through holes in the nebular envelope @xcite . finally , the inner ionized bipolar lobes of hb12 are surrounded by an h@xmath0 eye - shaped structure that is interpreted as a broad equatorial ring and a larger pair of bipolar lobes @xcite",
    ".    therefore , among the `` exclusive '' group of pne with different distributions of h@xmath0 and ionized gas , m2 - 9 , hb12 , and ngc6881 have ionized bipolar lobes that are enclosed within h@xmath0 bipolar lobes .",
    "we note , however , that hb12 is a notable case of uv - excited fluorescent h@xmath0 emission @xcite and the same is suspected for m2 - 9 @xcite , while ngc6881 is representative of collisionally excited h@xmath0 emission .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      the occurrence of multiple ejections of material is common among pne , particularly among type i multiple - shell pne that show faint , giant haloes @xcite .",
    "the haloes , interpreted as the relic of late thermal - pulse episodes @xcite , are mainly associated with elliptical or round pne , but are rare among bipolar pne .",
    "recurrent bipolar ejections resulting in multiple independent pairs of bipolar lobes have been reported for only a handful of pne .",
    "the different pairs of bipolar lobes may have similar morphology and orientation , e.g. , m2 - 9 @xcite , but in most cases they show notable differences , either affecting their morphology and degree of collimation , e.g. , mz3 @xcite , the orientation of their symmetry axes , e.g. , m2 - 46 @xcite , or its ionization degree , e.g. , hb12 @xcite . in ngc6881 , we find two pairs of highly collimated ionized lobes oriented along slightly different directions and a pair of h@xmath0 bipolar lobes with an open hourglass morphology .",
    "the two pairs of ionized lobes of ngc6881 , first reported by @xcite , have been described in detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "precession is evidenced by the different symmetry axes of each pair of ionized lobes and from the alignment between the equatorial ring and the youngest pair of bipolar lobes .",
    "the sharp morphology , similar kinematical age , and different orientation of the two pairs of bipolar lobes point to a sudden collimated ejection of material that has carved out bipolar cavities into the surrounding medium .",
    "the morphology of the ionized bipolar lobes of ngc6881 is very reminiscent of the proto - pn crl618 in which high - velocity jets moving along different directions @xcite have produced bipolar cavities in the nebular envelope @xcite .",
    "the similarities between the two bipolar nebulae extend to the coaxial rings of the bipolar cavities and to the bright , compact knots at their tips .",
    "the collimated outflows of crl618 might well evolved in the future into bipolar lobes similar to those of ngc6881 .",
    "the limb - brightened morphology of the h@xmath0 lobes indicates that the material is mainly confined in their walls , thus suggesting that the bipolar lobes carry enough momentum to sweep up and press the circumstellar medium into a thin sheet .",
    "indeed , the prevalent shock excitation of h@xmath0 requires a source of momentum .",
    "it is unlikely that a current fast ( @xmath111000  km  s@xmath23 ) wind from the central star would provide this momentum , as such a stellar wind would be trapped by the inner ionized lobes .",
    "our spectra do not provide information on the expansion velocity of the h@xmath0 lobes , but an upper limit can be derived assuming that the [ n  ii ] emission from the loop - like structure at the edge of the southeast lobe is produced by a shock . for a planar shock to be able to produce significant [ n  ii ] @xmath246584    emission , but low or minimal [ o  iii ] @xmath245007    emission @xcite , the shock velocity must not exceed @xmath1160  km  s@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "such high speed makes unlikely the origin of the momentum in the thermal pressure of hot gas within the bipolar lobes .",
    "however , the momentum of the h@xmath0 bipolar lobes must have been provided at the ejection time , either in a sudden bipolar ejection or through a stellar wind intrinsically bipolar or isotropic but collimated by an equatorial structure .",
    "the oblique shock of a bipolar lobe expanding at @xmath1160  km  s@xmath23 would be able to shock excite the h@xmath0 molecules along its edge , while giving rise to [ n  ii ] and h@xmath2 emission at its tip .",
    "such ballistic ejection may also explain the increasing h@xmath0 temperature excitation with the distance to the nebula center .",
    "the very different collimation degree of the ionized and h@xmath0 lobes of ngc6881 suggests that they formed during two different ejection events with substantial changes in the collimation conditions or even in the collimation mechanisms between the two episodes .",
    "the h@xmath0 lobes formed very likely by the action of an episodic wind producing an hourglass - shaped ejection , while high velocity jets ejected along close directions produced the two pairs of ionized lobes .",
    "an additional period of isotropic heavy mass loss resulting in a dense envelope is revealed by concentric arcs detected around the innermost regions of ngc6881 @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the southeast and northwest h@xmath0-dominated bipolar lobes are discrepant , with the former being smaller than the latter and showing a sharp edge at its southeast tip .",
    "this sharp edge is spatially coincident with a [ n  ii ] loop - like feature ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , a structure that has been interpreted as a low velocity precessing jet @xcite , but that , in view of the perfect spatial coincidence with the southeast tip of the h@xmath0 lobe , seems more likely to mark its termination .",
    "the abrupt border of the southeast h@xmath0 lobe and the [ n  ii ] loop - like structure may unveil the interaction of this bipolar lobe lobe with dense material .",
    "as we noted in @xmath53.1 , ngc6881 is embedded within diffuse emission that forms part of sh2 - 109 , an inhomogeneous h  ii region located at a distance of 1.4@xmath220.4 kpc and with a diameter of 400@xmath22100 pc @xcite . in view of the hint of interaction of the southeast h@xmath0 lobe of ngc6881 with dense material , resulting in the notably different morphologies of the southeast and northwest lobes , it is worthwhile to investigate the physical association of ngc6881 with sh2 - 109 .",
    "the distance to ngc6881 has been estimated to be 2.5 kpc by @xcite who used the shklovsky method according to the daub scheme . in their work ,",
    "cahn et al .  used an angular radius of 25 which seems inadequate as it only traces the bright , central regions of ngc6881 .",
    "this region has an angular radius @xmath1112 , but if we account for the ionized bipolar lobes , then an averaged angular radius of 65 has to be used .",
    "if we adopt this radius , then the revised distance to ngc6881 using the cahn et al .  method would be @xmath111.5 kpc , supporting its physical association with the h  ii region sh2 - 109 .",
    "an inspection of iphas h@xmath2 images of this region reveals that the diffuse emission in which ngc6881 is embedded constitutes the eastern wall of a large cavity - like structure .",
    "h  i 21  cm line observations of the neutral gas distribution and kinematics of the region confirm that this structure is a cavity with an expansion velocity @xmath1110  km  s@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity of this h  i cavity , @xmath25  km  s@xmath23 , is very similar to the radial velocity of ngc6881 , @xmath26  km  s@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the projection of the nebula onto the h  i cavity and their similar radial velocities suggest that ngc6881 may be located within this cavity , with its h@xmath0-dominated southeast lobe hitting onto the dense material at the wall of the cavity , slowing it down and producing a sharp edge , while the northwest h@xmath0 lobe expands into the h  i cavity with little opposition .",
    "new images and near - ir spectra of ngc6881 confirm the different distribution of ionized material and molecular hydrogen within this pn .",
    "the h@xmath0 images have resolved its central region which shows the spatial distribution expected for a ring of molecular material surrounding an innermost ionized ring .",
    "the h@xmath0 bipolar lobes share the same orientation than the ionized lobes , but they are less collimated and display a distinct hourglass morphology .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is predominantly shock excited , both in the central ring and in the h@xmath0 bipolar lobes .",
    "we infer a complex history formation for ngc6881 , involving important changes in the collimation mechanism of the bipolar lobes in the latest evolutionary stages .",
    "the h@xmath0 bipolar lobes are consistent with the action of a bipolar wind .",
    "the final evolution of the pn implied the ejection of episodic fast collimated outflows with changing directions that interacted with the dense circumstellar envelope ejected in a previous phase .",
    "the southeast h@xmath0 lobe of ngc6881 is less extended than the northwest lobe and shows a sharp edge , implying the interaction of ngc6881 with an inhomogeneous interstellar medium .",
    "we find very likely that ngc6881 is within a cavity in the midst of the h  ii region sh2 - 109 .",
