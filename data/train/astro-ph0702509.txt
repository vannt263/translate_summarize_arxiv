    "the next generation of wide - area extragalactic submillimetre and millimetre surveys , will produce large samples ( @xmath4 ) of distant , luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "the dramatic increase in the number of detected galaxies makes it necessary to identify a selection technique that can efficiently generate redshift selected subsamples that are then explored in greater detail with optical / ir and mm follow - up facilities , such as alma .",
    "given the underlying assumption that we are witnessing high rates of star formation in these ( sub-)millimetre galaxies ( see blain , in this volume ) , then we expect them to have the characteristic fir peak and steep submillimetre ( rayleigh - jeans ) spectrum which is dominated by thermal emission from dust grains heated to temperatures in the range @xmath5k by heavily obscured young , massive stars .",
    "the observed radio  fir luminosity correlation in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. helou , soifer & rowan - robinson 1985 ) , that links the radio synchrotron emission from supernova remnants with the later stages of massive star formation , is also expected to apply to these galaxies .",
    "thus , in recent years , a considerable amount of effort has been invested in assessing the accuracy with which these broad continuum features in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of submillimetre galaxies , at rest - frame mid - ir to radio wavelengths can be used to provide photometric - redshifts ( hughes et al .",

    "this paper is an update on previous work ( aretxaga et al .",
    "2005 ) that assessed the accuracy of the fir - mm - radio photometric redshift techniques given the larger samples of spectroscopic redshifts recently published in the literature ( see chapman and tacconi , in this volume , and references therein , for the primary sources of comparison data ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters adopted throughout this paper are @xmath6  kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the 1.4ghz/850@xmath2 m spectral index is discussed following 3 different prescriptions : the one - template maximum - likelihood technique originally designed by carilli & yun ( 1999 , 2000 ) , denoted as @xmath10 ; a maximum likelihood technique which simultaneously fits the 20 local templates of starbursts , ulirgs and agn used by aretxaga et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2005 ) , denoted as @xmath11 ; and a multi - template maximum - likelihood technique that uses the 3 blue compact dwarf seds of hunt & maiolino ( 2005 ) that reproduce the radio  mm  fir data of sub - mm galaxies ( the templates for ngc5253 , and two flavours of iizw40 seds with radio slopes @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , which we denote as @xmath14 .",
    "for all three techniques the error bars of the photometric redshifts were derived by bootstrapping on the reported photometric and calibration errors and , in the case of @xmath15 , the error estimated by carilli & yun ( 2000 ) , to allow for a difference in templates , is added in quadrature to the errors derived by bootstrapping the photometry .",
    "we have assembled a sample of 86 objects which have published optical / ir or co spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath16 ) and accompanying photometry to assess the accuracy of the techniques described in this paper .    using the 1.4ghz to 850@xmath2 m color ratio and the @xmath17 prescription , we find a mean accuracy of @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cy_a ] ) for a robust sub - sample of objects with undisputed interpretation about their optical / ir / radio counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts derived from the identification of more than two spectral features .",
    "this subsample does not include powerful radio - loud agn , for which the templates used in the photometric redshift analysis are not appropriate . restricting the analysis only to those galaxies with co spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "the measured accuracy is @xmath19 .",
    "the error distribution for the sample of galaxies is centered at @xmath20 , which we do not regard as significant as it is well below the resolution used in the monte carlo simulations that aid the calculation of the photometric redshifts .",
    "the precision degrades as the redshift increases , as expected from the 1.4ghz/850@xmath2 m spectral index , which flattens beyond @xmath21 ( carilli & yun 2000 ) , leading to a measured @xmath22 at @xmath23 . using all objects with published photometry",
    ", regardless of whether the spectroscopic redshift is suspected to be incorrect or not , or is not regarded as robustly determined , the overall accuracy over the @xmath24 regime degrades to @xmath25 .",
    "we find that for the same robust sample of objects , @xmath26 has systematically larger errors , @xmath27 , while the @xmath28 provides a similar @xmath29 dispersion compared to the results of @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath28 prescription gives , however , poorer estimations of the redshift for the co confirmed sources ( @xmath31 ) than the @xmath30 technique ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "for a few tens of sources , multiwavelength data in the radio to fir regime is available , beyond the 1.4ghz and 850@xmath2 m photometry .",
    "these additional data can also be used to place extra constraints on the redshift of the sources by sampling the fir bump .",
    "this information has been exploited by several groups , including our own , using a wide array of fitting techniques and seds ( e.g. yun & carilli 2002 , wiklind 2003 , laurent et al .",
    "our own particular technique is based on monte - carlo simulations to also take into account constraining prior information such as the number counts of submm galaxies , the favoured luminosity / density evolution up to @xmath33 , and the amplification or clustering of a certain field ( hughes et al .",
    "2002 , aretxaga et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "we only offer a brief summary of the technique here .",
    "we generate a catalogue of 60@xmath2 m luminosities and redshifts for mock galaxies from an evolutionary model for the @xmath34 m luminosity function that fits the observed 850@xmath2 m number - counts .",
    "randomly - selected template seds are drawn from a library of local starbursts , ulirgs and agn , to provide fir  radio fluxes .",
    "the seds cover a wide - range of fir luminosities ( @xmath35 ) and temperatures ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the fluxes of the mock galaxies include both photometric and calibration errors , consistent with the quality of the observational data for the sub - mm galaxy detected in a particular survey .",
    "we reject from the catalogue those mock galaxies that do not respect the detection thresholds and upper - limits of the particular sub - mm galaxy under analysis .",
    "the redshift probability distribution of a sub - mm galaxy is then calculated as the normalized distribution of the redshifts of the mock galaxies in the reduced catalogue , weighted by the likelihood of identifying the colours and fluxes of each mock galaxy with those of the sub - mm galaxy in question .",
    "2 shows an example of our method for lh850.1 , the brightest source of the scuba 8mjy survey in lockman hole field ( scott et al .",

    "2002 , greve et al .",

    "2005 , 2006 ) , that tentatively has been assigned the optical / ir spectroscopic redshift of a plausible counterpart at @xmath37 ( chapman et al .",
    "2005 , ivison et al . 2005 ) .    using the full sed information of a robust sub - sample of 13 objects ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sed_a ] ) with undisputed identification of their optical / ir / radio counterparts and spectroscopic redshifts derived from the measurement of two spectral features or more , we find a mean accuracy of @xmath38 . restricting the analysis only to those 5 galaxies with co spectroscopic redshifts , the measured accuracy is @xmath39 .",
    "the error distribution for the robust sample of galaxies is centered in @xmath40 , which is within the resolution afforded by the monte carlo simulations that aid the photometric redshifts .",
    "in contrast with the simple 1.4ghz/850@xmath2 m spectral index , the precision does not degrade as the redshift increases .",
    "three extra galaxies can be included in the same analysis , that have not been confirmed by a co detection at the published optical / ir spectroscopic redshift .",
    "this could be due to an erroneous redshift or insufficient sensitivity in the search for a co line . including these 3 objects in the analysis",
    ", we find an overall precision of @xmath41 .",
    "using all objects with published photometry , regardless of whether the spectroscopic redshift is questioned or not , the overall accuracy over the @xmath24 regime degrades to @xmath42 , with some significant outliers ( lower panel of fig .",
    "the two outliers at the lowest redshift correspond to lh850.8 ( at @xmath43 ) and n2850.1 ( at @xmath44 ) , and their observed seds can not be reproduced by any of the sed templates in our library at the published spectroscopic redshift ( fig .  4 ,",
    "see also aretxaga et al .",
    "2005 and laurent et al .",
    "2006 ) , or by the blue compact dwarf seds of hunt & maiolino , which have been claimed to provide better fits to the overall sub - mm galaxy photometry than those of giant star - forming galaxies  although the inspection of fig.4 , shows that these three templates lie within the range of the templates of ulirgs , agn and local star - forming galaxies used in aretxaga et al ( 2003 ) .",
    "the robustness of the optical associations for n2850.1 and lh850.8 has been questioned in the literature ( chapman et al .",
    "2002 , ivison et al .",
    "apart from a true association , it also has been suggested that a plausible low-@xmath45 lens magnifies the true higher-@xmath45 sub - mm galaxy , or that the true counterpart is identified by an alternative radio source .",
    "the co - confirmation of the low - redshift nature of these galaxies would be an important evidence for the existence of a different starburst sed within the sub - mm galaxy population that is not seen in the local analogs , and which should , therefore , be incorporated into the photometric redshift estimations .",
    "for the time being we consider them in the tentative category of spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the combination of more sensitive rest - frame radio to fir data with more complete wavelength coverage , that define the seds of individual galaxies identified in the next generation of fir  radio surveys , will derive photometric - redshifts with even greater accuracy than those presented here .",
    "furthermore , given the depth and area of these future surveys it will be extremely difficult , and often impossible , to provide useful follow - up data at optical and ir wavelengths .",
    "thus we expect the use of photometric - redshifts to quickly increase in importance as they influence the interpretation of these new cosmological surveys .",
    "the additional power of photometric redshifts however is their ability to efficiently select from these new fir - radio catalogues , sub - samples of sources in well - defined redshift intervals that can be targeted by the next generation of broad - band ( sub)millimetre spectroscopic receivers presented at this meeting .",
    "the future photometric redshifts from radio  fir data will be essential in maximising the use of telescope time on facilities such as alma by limiting the selection of receiver tunings required to successfully search for and detect redshifted co - lines . since two co - lines , identified with specific transitions ,",
    "are required to unambiguously determine a spectroscopic redshift , then the combined use of a single co - line and the photometric - redshift distribution can place important constraints on the possible frequencies that must search for a confirming second - line ( see yun in these proceedings ) .",
    "the ideal solution is to combine a telescope with sufficient collecting area , to provide the sensitivity , and a millimetre spectrometer with sufficient bandwidth to always detect two co - lines , or alternatively a co - line and ci , regardless of the redshift of the source .",
    "the large millimetre telescope ( lmt ) and its redshift receiver ( erickson  these proceedings ) almost satisfy these requirements with the exception of the redshift interval ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( hughes et al . -",
    "these proceedings ) .    to conclude",
    ", the different technological approaches described in this meeting to provide sensitive broad - band receivers at millimetre - wavelengths , with stable and flat spectral - baselines , will have an enormous impact on the follow - up of the most heavily - obscured continuum sources for which optical and ir techniques fail .",
    "the secure individual spectroscopic redshifts , and redshift distribution for the populations of heavily - obscured starburst galaxies , that will be derived from molecular - line emission at ( sub)millimetre wavelengths , will provide critical data to understand the biases inherent in the identification of the counterparts that ultimately lead to the optical  ir spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "these co - line data will determine the general physical properties of the gas in the molecular ism of galaxies in the high - redshift universe and provide estimates of their dynamical masses .",
