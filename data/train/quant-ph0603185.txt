    "light forces in optical resonators are strongly modified as compared to free space @xcite . extending the ideas of laser cooling in free space , various new schemes of laser cooling of atoms",
    "have now been developed in the field of cavity qed theoretically ( for a review , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) and experimentally @xcite .",
    "the common basis of all these considerations constitute the strong correlations between the atomic motion and the dynamics of the cavity field .",
    "contrary to conventional laser cooling schemes relying on spontaneous emission , dissipation of energy and entropy from the atomic motion is provided here by the cavity decay channel , where the emission of blue shifted photons is enhanced . under ideal circumstances",
    ", it is possible to implement very efficient laser cooling schemes with strongly suppressed spontaneous emission .",
    "hence , the underlying mechanism is applicable to any polarizable particle and , in particular , also to molecules where no closed excitation cycle is necessarily available .",
    "as momentum diffusion ( heating ) originates mainly from field fluctuations due to the randomness of photon loss via the cavity mirrors , the attainable atomic temperature is limited by the cavity linewidth @xmath0 @xcite . in high - finesse cavities ,",
    "one even gets sub - doppler cooling @xcite , but at the expense of a slow cooling rate .    among several suggestions to circumvent this slowdown , like e.g.  using collectively enhanced light scattering @xcite , it has been recently proposed to add a gain medium into the cavity to achieve lower temperatures and fast cooling simultaneously @xcite . the central idea here amounts to obtain an effectively small cavity linewidth via intracavity amplification in a not so good resonator . in a first approach to this idea , vuletic predicted improved cooling by a strong reduction of the effective cavity linewidth through addition of intracavity gain @xcite .",
    "in essence , the partial compensation of the cavity round trip loss by gain gives rise to an enhancement of the cavity - to - free - space scattering ratio substantially above unity , even for rather lossy resonators .",
    "as , in such systems , the cooling force is proportional to this scattering ratio , he predicted both fast cooling and low final atomic temperatures .",
    "of course , gain in quantum mechanics is inevitably connected with fluctuations , so that the validity of the connection of temperature and linewidth is not so obvious any more in this case .    in the present work , we follow this general idea but use a more refined approach based on microscopic modeling of gain by an ensemble of inverted atoms .",
    "the effects of quantum fluctuations and saturation are thus automatically modeled in a self - consistent way and the model is a direct generalization of our recent investigations of a single - atom  single - mode laser including light forces @xcite . in this configuration , we could show that by a suitable choice of parameters ( i.e.  blue detuning of the field mode with respect to the atomic transition ) , single - atom lasing can be combined with trapping and cooling of the atom at a cavity field mode antinode . in the stationary limit",
    ", the average kinetic energy of the particle can be lower than the optical potential depth of the laser field that is created by the atom itself . extending this laser model to many atoms ,",
    "we directly get a microscopic model for a hot cavity by simply fixing the positions of some of the atoms . these represent our gain medium as they are partially inverted through external driving",
    "of course , beyond merely providing for gain , they play a much more complex role in the combined atom - field dynamics .    from a different point of view",
    ", we are extending the standard haken - lamb laser model @xcite by including light forces on the active atoms and study lasing as well as their trapping and cooling properties .",
    "as compared to the single - atom laser model , the trapping field is now generated from all the active atoms simultaneously , so that each one has to be less inverted to achieve a desired optical potential ( photon number ) .",
    "this should reduce spontaneous emission and momentum diffusion of the atoms and we can expect better trapping and lower temperatures . in a first step to simply mimic an active medium , we will keep all atoms but one fixed at antinodes and study the dynamics of the remaining atom . in the parameter regimes where we find trapping and cooling of the test atom , its parameters",
    "can then be prescribed to the other atoms to find a self - consistent final solution for all atoms .",
    "our work here is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the general model and define the relevant quantities and parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : semi ] we numerically study the semiclassical limit of the equations where we replace the field and atomic operators by their expectation values and factorize expectation values of operator products . a laser model which includes second order quantum correlations is presented and analytically solved in sec .",

    "[ subsec : motion ] - [ subsec : scaling ] .",
    "again we can find analytic expressions for the relevant physical quantities allowing a thorough discussion of the properties of the present system .",

    "subsec : steady ] . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : temperature ] , we calculate the friction and diffusion coefficients which give rise to an estimate of the atomic localization and equilibrium temperature . finally , the scaling properties of these quantities with the number of atoms are discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : scaling ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review key elements of the haken - lamb laser model @xcite , which ignores atomic motion , to get a first insight into the dynamics on a simple and intuitive level .",
    "the laser active gas consists of @xmath1 identical two - level atoms ( represented by their pauli operators @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 ) which interact with a single mode supported by an optical high - finesse resonator .",
    "each atomic dipole is coupled to the cavity mode ( represented by the bosonic field operator @xmath5 ) with coupling constant @xmath6 times the mode function @xmath7 evaluated at the corresponding position of the atom @xmath8 . in the simplest ( one - dimensional ) case , the mode function is given by @xmath9 with mode wavenumber @xmath10 .",
    "the cavity resonance frequency @xmath11 is generally detuned from the atomic transition frequency @xmath12 by a small amount @xmath13 , on the order of a few atomic linewidths at most . in a frame rotating at the cavity frequency , the atom - field hamilton operator including interaction then reads within the rotating - wave approximation @xmath14 in addition to this coherent dynamics , the atoms as well as the resonator mode are also weakly coupled to the environment . using a standard master - equation approach @xcite for spontaneous emission of the atoms into the vacuum ( with rate @xmath15 for each atom ) and photon loss via the mirrors ( with rate @xmath16 ) ,",

    "since gain requires atomic population inversion , we need to add pumping of the atoms . in practice ,",
    "such pumping is achieved via an auxiliary atomic level actively coupled to the lower level which decays predominantly into the atomic upper state within a short time . as introduced by haken",
    "already some decades ago @xcite , this process can be modeled in a quantum mechanically consistent way by a so - called inverted heat bath approach which properly accounts for the fluctuations that are accompanied by gain , without the need to enlarge the atomic hilbert space .",
    "basically , it amounts to introducing a spontaneous absorption rate @xmath19 , analogous to spontaneous emission but in the opposite direction .",
    "mathematically , we simply have to add the following liouvillian term @xmath20 to our master equation ( me ) . putting all terms together",
    ", the resulting me is equivalent to the heisenberg - langevin equations ( hle ) [ with @xmath21 ,    [ hle ] @xmath22    fluctuations are properly included here in the noise terms @xmath23 which follow from eqs .   and .",
    "notice , that at this point the atomic center - of - mass ( com ) positions are simply contained as c - number parameters @xcite . as these equations are coupled and nonlinear , a direct analytical solution nevertheless seems out of reach and a vast amount of theoretical work on laser theory has been devoted to their solution in the past decades @xcite . here",
    ", we will only resort to the most common proven approximations in the following .",
    "starting from the corresponding quantum hle for the polarization and field dynamics , we obtain approximate c - number equations by simply taking expectation values of these equations and factorizing expectation values of operator products into products of single - operator expectation values . within this approximation , we do not need to further specify the noise terms as their expectation values are zero by construction .",
    "this approach is generally known as semiclassical laser theory .",

    "contain the positions of the atoms as fixed parameters via @xmath26 . as a new element",
    ", we now introduce the atomic com motion into the system so that the positions @xmath27 get dynamical and are governed by light forces . within the point particle model which is based upon a classical treatment of the atomic com motion @xcite , the corresponding newtonian equations of motion are    [ external ] @xmath28    with the force acting on the @xmath29th atom given by @xmath30 and @xmath31 denoting the atomic mass .",
    "note that this description of the external dynamics via point particles is only valid as long as the respective atomic kinetic energies are well above the recoil limit @xmath32 , which is well fulfilled down to atomic temperatures in the order of only a few micro kelvin .",
    "although the particles are now moving , the system can still posses a quasistationary state . here",
    "the field as well as the atomic momentum and position distributions which might be characterized by an effective kinetic temperature are approximately constant in time . as in other single - mode  two - level laser models , we find a steady - state energy balance relation for the total atomic ground and excited state populations [ i.e.  @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively ] and the mean photon number @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( note that @xmath37 . )",
    "this relation describes the balance of energy fed into the system by the pumping mechanism and the photon loss via atomic spontaneous emission and cavity field decay .",
    "relation is quite universal and valid beyond the semiclassical treatment so that we will recover it in the quantum model in sects .",
    "[ subsec : active ] and [ subsec : steady ] .",
    "note that it does not include the kinetic and potential energy fed into the atomic motion in single emission or absorption events ( recoil energy ) since it is only a negligible fraction of the photon energy or internal atomic excitation energy and , thus , only very weakly modifies the conditions for the lasing threshold .",
    "thus the system should exhibit coherent oscillation if @xmath38 where we have introduced the rate of emission into the resonator mode per atom as @xmath39 of course , the total rate @xmath40 depends on the atomic positions and hence the spacial distribution of the atoms has influence on whether threshold is reached or not . in the limiting case where all atoms are located close to field nodes , the total rate @xmath41 gets very small , which will eventually prevent the system from reaching threshold . in this case , the single - atom excitation is determined by the rates of pumping and spontaneous emission , @xmath42 , and the cavity mode remains unpopulated .",
    "hence we also get not forces on the atoms , and the optical potential vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "when the system operates above threshold , the steady - state of the population inversion for each atom is fixed by @xmath43 and the mean photon number can be determined from the relation .",

    ", the population inversion reaches its maximum value at threshold and eventually drops back to zero , when the growing stimulated emission ( gain ) decreases the upper state population .",

    "@xcite , an inverted atom is a high - field seeker for a blue detuned field . as a consequence",
    ", we have to work with a blue detuned cavity , i.e.  @xmath49 , if we want our gain atoms to be drawn towards field antinodes where the gain is large .",
    "luckily , this coincides with the parameter regime where the motion can be cooled via gain as some kinetic energy is needed to optimally fulfill the energy resonance condition for stimulated emission @xcite .    to demonstrate this we plot in fig .",

    "lasing , cooling , and trapping can coexist for a blue detuned light field @xcite under suitable conditions .",
    "we found that atomic equilibrium temperatures below the doppler limit are possible , but this poses very stringent conditions onto the atomic pumping mechanisms .",
    "characteristically , the final atomic equilibrium temperature decreases with higher intracavity photon numbers and the particle s localization is enhanced .",

    "generally , we expect that larger photon numbers lead to lower temperatures since cooling relies on energy dissipation by photons that leave the resonator via its mirrors . in the ideal regime",
    ", each photon carries away some atomic kinetic energy . as a second advantage of more atoms",
    ", we expect that heating due to spontaneous emission is diminished as the atoms share the required excitation .",
    "finally , since the equilibrium temperature for cavity cooling scales with the linewidth @xmath0 @xcite , an effectively gain - reduced linewidth lets us further expect enhanced cooling .    in what follows we consider a single atom moving under the influence of the field created by stimulated emission of the atom itself and the active medium described in sec .",

    ", the active medium introduces an extra noise term which should lead to additional momentum diffusion .",
    "moreover , we infer from fig .  [",
    "fig : funf ] ( a ) and ( b ) that larger values of the atom - field detuning @xmath109 , certainly decreasing the photon number , result in larger friction as well as momentum diffusion .",
    "however , we will later see how we can compare situations with different atom numbers in a more favorable way where the photon number , the atomic population inversion , and the gain parameter are independent of @xmath1 .",
    "let us finally mention here that the cooling rate is inversely proportional to @xmath117 such that large values of @xmath117 will lead to fast cooling .",
    "the resulting equilibrium temperature @xmath114 associated with the atomic com motion is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : funf ] ( c ) in units of the doppler temperature @xmath127 . analyzing this plot",
    ", we can identify two regimes according to the scaled pumping rate @xmath128 . as long as there are only a few atoms in the cavity , the atomic temperature decreases with increasing @xmath129 .",
    "in fact , this is in strong analogy to the single - atom case where we showed that temperatures even below the limit of passive cavity cooling are possible for sufficiently large @xmath129 @xcite . here ,",
    "on the other hand , the addition of even a single atom can lead to a significant drop in the temperature , which already proves the importance of cooperative aspects . depending on the actual value of the detuning @xmath109 , we eventually find , with growing @xmath1 , a transition point to a second regime where the cooling performance can be enhanced for lower pumping rates @xmath129 that we achieved by raising @xmath109 .",
    "the cooling enhancement only happens for sufficiently large atom numbers and is directly related with the fact that strong pumping immediately saturates the gain here .",
    "indeed , one has to ensure not to saturate the gain as the cooperative effects of emission will then break and , as a consequence , the cooling efficiency is reduced .",
    "each curve shows a minimum which tends towards larger @xmath1 when we increase the detuning @xmath109 . for fixed parameters",
    ", the minimum corresponds to a somehow optimum atom number @xmath1 which keeps the balance between the required population inversion on the one hand and saturation on the other hand . in this sense",
    ", lowering the scaled pumping rate @xmath129 means that we can involve more atoms into the cooling process without saturating the gain at once .",
    "note that for the chosen parameters here , which do not require to be in the strong atom - field coupling regime , one can achieve sub - doppler cooling for @xmath130 . in view of a setup where one has to assure that the atoms remain in the interaction region close to field antinodes ,",
    "we will now focus on localization effects . therefore we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : funf ] ( d ) the ratio of the atomic kinetic energy @xmath131 and the light potential @xmath106 .",
    "large values of this ratio correspond to a more or less even distribution of the particle s position while values below one indicate strong localization .",
    "one can again identify the afore mentioned regimes of low and high atom numbers @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "qualitatively , the curves for @xmath132 are similar to the ones for the temperature and we recognize that cooling is directly accompanied by atomic trapping for sufficiently high @xmath1 . in particular , the ratio @xmath132 drops well below unity when the atomic temperature gets down into the range of the doppler limit .",
    "as already mentioned before , the cooling properties may significantly depend on the initial atomic temperature and localization .",
    "for rather cold and well localized atoms , in particular , the position dependence of the cooling forces must be taken into account .",
    "typically , the cooling time scale strongly increases as soon as an initially rather hot ensemble of cavity - cooled atoms gets trapped .",
    "( notice , that we have already seen a similar effect in sec .",
    "[ sec : semi ] although no information about the equilibrium temperature and cooling time could be given there . ) moreover , it has been shown that in the limit of very strong confinement , the friction forces can even vanish such that the cooling process completely stops @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , strong cooling forces may arise in the high - intensity regime resulting in very strong atomic localization @xcite , where the additional momentum diffusion leads to a mere slight increase of the atomic equilibrium temperature .    in order to get an estimate of the influence of localization effects on the cooling performance in a hot cavity",
    ", we will derive the gain - induced enhancement of the friction for a rather well localized atom .",
    "for @xmath111 , it is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 indicates the single - atom friction coefficient .",
    "in the previous section , we have calculated the same expression for die stationary force which turned out to scale inversely with the effective linewidth @xmath67 . since @xmath135 , the cooling forces are even more enhanced than the trapping potential such that an atom trapped very close to field antinodes still experience relatively large friction as soon as @xmath136 .",
    "we therefore deduce that , besides providing strong particle localization , the stimulated - emission mediated cooling forces can significantly accelerate the cooling process as compared to conventional schemes using passive resonators .     in units of the minimum temperature achievable by passive cavity cooling .",
    "@xmath114 is plotted as a function of the atom number @xmath1 where @xmath137 was kept constant for different pumping rates @xmath129 , as indicated .",
    "+ ( b ) corresponding ratio @xmath132.,width=302 ]      in the good - cavity limit ( @xmath138 ) , the gain - induced cooling of a single particle can lead to atomic temperatures well below the limit of passive cavity cooling for sufficiently large amount of pumping ratio @xmath129 and when one can neglect spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the required large excitation rate @xmath45 certainly poses a serious experimental challenge there . as we already have seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : funf ] , the use of many atoms for stimulated photon emission into the resonator can enhance trapping and also lower the particle s kinetic energy , even for small values of @xmath129 . in the following",
    ", we will now analyze the scaling of the cooling properties with respect to the atom number @xmath1 to see whether this method should work for larger ensembles under less restrictive experimental conditions .    for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a rescaling of the system parameters as follows . as we have seen above , the comparison of the motional properties for different @xmath1 is actually not trivial .",
    "particularly , not only the photon number @xmath52 but also the population inversion @xmath65 as well as the gain parameter @xmath73 play a crucial role there as they all depend on @xmath1 in a highly nonlinear way . a good choice will certainly be a rescaling which keeps these three quantities constant at all",
    ". a closer look at eqs .  , , and reveals that one can realize this all at once by keeping the quotient @xmath137 constant .",
    "consequently , the operating point of the lasing system can be set independently from the atom number without any further complications .",
    "we will accomplish this here by relating the total amount of emission into the resonator to the photon loss rate according to @xmath139 via the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 and hence the operating point can then be set by a proper choice of the coupling constant @xmath6 . besides , this",
    "rescaling accounts for comparable conditions also in the energy balance .",
    "having fixed a certain operating point , the established light intensity no longer depends on the number of atoms involved .",
    "regardless , however , the rate of photon leakage through the cavity mirrors , given by @xmath140 , linearly grows now with the atom number .",
    "since each photon carries away energy and entropy from the system , we expect not only lower temperatures but also faster cooling .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sechs ] ( a ) we show the scaling of the atomic temperature with @xmath1 for different values of @xmath129 where we assumed @xmath141 . clearly , @xmath114 drops well below the limit of passive cavity cooling which is given by @xmath142 .",
    "when many atoms are involved , this happens even for values of the pumping ratio @xmath129 beneath the single - atom limit @xmath143 .",
    "the corresponding ratio @xmath132 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sechs ] ( b ) .",
    "again we find simultaneous trapping and cooling .",
    "this result suggests the possibility to use a rather bad cavity and many weakly pumped active atoms as gain medium to achieve stimulated emission induced cooling .",
    "fortunately , these conditions simultaneously ease the requirements on cavity technology and on the necessary amount of pumping per atom @xmath129 and give a rather promising perspective of possible implementations of the scheme .",
    "we have shown that intracavity gain significantly modifies light forces in cavities . in particular , the stimulated - emission dominated interaction of individual particles with a single light mode opens new perpectives on the dynamics of lasing and light - induced manipulation of the atomic motion . to exhibit the underlying physics in detail , we developed a quantum consistent theory for intracavity gain , based on a microscopic description of an ensemble of individual inverted atoms strongly coupled to a single resonator mode . including light forces into well - established laser equations",
    ", we found a self - consistent analytical model for the combined dynamics of the atomic motion in a hot cavity .",
    "as an extra bonus , by accounting for spontaneous emission and cavity decay , fluctuations and saturation are automatically included in our model by construction .    as a central result , we can confirm previous claims @xcite that laser cooling can be strongly improved in such a setup with less stringend requirements on cavity technology .",
    "this result turns out to be closely related to a strong reduction of the effective resonator linewidth as the amplifying atoms partly balance the photon loss via stimulated emission . in this way",
    ", photon scattering into the cavity , which accounts for the cooling forces , can be drastically enhanced .",
    "while the naive expectation of a much reduced temperature due to the narrow linewidth is not fully met by the results , we still get much faster cooling and sub - doppler temperatures .",
    "our findings show the potential usefulness of stimulated - emission induced cooling in optical resonators and may open the way to novel experiments .",
    "more importantly however , we recover that optical lasing can be concurrent with strong atomic localization and sub - doppler cooling .",
    "this directly points to the possibility of combined photon lasing and atom lasing in the continuous - wave ( cw ) regime . in a conceivable joint setup",
    ", a coherent atomic beam could be out - coupled from an ultra cold ensemble of atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "the atoms are cooled to the motional ground state without particle loss by raman gain involving stimulated emission into a resonator mode .",
    "the photon leakage through the cavity mirrors provides the photon laser channel there . in order to achieve combined cw lasing operation",
    ", the cooling region is fed by atomic tunneling from neighbouring sites .",
    "ground - state atoms which are prepared in a non coupling hyperfine state by a proper microwave beam leave the trap due to gravity .    the authors would like to thank p.  domokos for fruitful discussions .",
