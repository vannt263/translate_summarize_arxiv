    "the so - called nonequilibrium relaxation ( ner ) method @xcite deals with the nonequilibrium critical relaxation of a statistical model instantaneously brought to its critical temperature from its nonequilibrium initial state , typically a fully ordered state .",
    "a unique feature about the ner method is that it allows one to determine the equilibrium critical properties of statisitical systems from their _ nonequilibrium _ relaxation kinetics .",
    "therefore , together with the method @xcite using a short - time critical dynamic properties @xcite ( see section iii.d ) , the ner method has been an interesting and valuable tool to study the statistical systems whose critical properties are unknown .    with recent advances in computing power",
    ", it seems worthwhile to reinvestigate in more depth the potentials or limitations of the ner method in terms of numerical accuracies in static and dynamic exponents . in this work we chose the ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model @xcite on a square lattice ( with @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) as a testground for the ner method .",
    "it appears to us that in applying the ner method , the energy relaxation itself has been overlooked in evaluating the critical exponents : previous works @xcite employed mainly the second moments involving the energy , ignoring the relaxation of the energy itself . in this work",
    "we utilized the critical energy relaxation as well as that of the order parameter for evaluating the critical exponents . due to better self - averaging of these single moment quantities ,",
    "higher accuracy is expected for the estimates of the exponents . since for the ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model the critical temperature and energy are exactly known for general values of @xmath0 , and the static critical exponents",
    "are exactly known for @xmath5 @xcite , our work can be considered as a calibrational study on the ner method as to how accurate estimates for the critical exponents can be given via the ner method .",
    "we find that by combining the relaxation of the two first - moment quantities , i.e. , order parameter and energy one can obtain the ratio of the equilibrium critical exponents , through which the nature of the phase transition or , equivalently , the universality class , may be determined regardless of our knowledge of the exact value of the dynamic exponent @xmath6 . by incorporating the time dependence of the second moment of the order parameter ( starting from either disordered or ordered initial states ) , the dynamic exponent can be independently obtained .",
    "this can be combined with the relaxation of the first moment quantities to give the two independent static exponents .",
    "we here find that the second moment of the order parameter obtained with disordered initial state gives the static exponents with higher accuracy .",
    "alternative way of obtaining static exponents is to employ the second moments involving energy fluctuations .",
    "however , the energy fluctuation appears to be influenced by strong logarithmic corrections in the case of @xmath1 , which makes it difficult to estimate the exponents with high accuracy .",
    "the present work is motivated by our interest in applying the ner method to the statistical systems whose critical properties are not completely understood .",
    "we are particularly interested in clarifying the long - standing controversy on the critical properties of the ffxy model @xcite on a square lattice @xcite and the antiferromagnetic xy model @xcite ( or the antiferromagnetic clock model @xcite ) on a triangular lattice .",
    "even though there exist previous studies @xcite from nonequilibrium dynamics perspective on this problem , we hope to undertake more careful studies on the ffxy models by applying the ner method with the strategy presented in this work .",
    "in the ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model on a square lattice each spin @xmath7 can take one of the @xmath0 possible values , @xmath8 , and the spin interaction is defined by the following hamiltonian h =- j _",
    "< ij > ( _ i , _ j ) , _",
    "i=1 , 2 , , q where @xmath9 is the kronecker delta function and @xmath10 denotes the nearest neighbor spin pair .",
    "@xmath11 is the interaction strength .",
    "the model is known to exhibit a continuous phase transition for @xmath5 and discontinuous ones for @xmath12 in two dimensions @xcite . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the potts model is equivalent with the ising model since @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "it is remarkable that though the model is not exactly solvable except for @xmath1 , the critical temperature @xmath15 and energy @xmath16 are exactly known for general @xmath0 in some two dimensional lattices . for the square lattice they are given by @xcite k_b t_c = , e_c =- j ( 1 + ) where @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant . here and after we set @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "hence @xmath20 , @xmath21 for @xmath1 , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 for @xmath3 .",
    "the exact static critical exponents are given in table  i.    we will be interested in characterizing the time evolution of the system instantaneously heated to @xmath15 from a fully ordered initial state .",
    "the system then proceeds toward the equilibrium via monte carlo kinetics with the metropolis algorithm for the flip of a randomly selected spin . since we are interested in the long time dynamics of the system in the thermodynamic limit , we take the system size large enough so that the simulation can appropriately mimic the nonequilibrium relaxation of the infinitely large system within the simulation time window",
    "this is similar to the case of phase - ordering kinetics @xcite in which the equilibration time is practically infinite due to large system size , making the time evolution ever nonequilibrium .",
    "we use the square lattice with linear size @xmath24 .",
    "the maximum simulation time is @xmath25 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) .",
    "the presented results are averages over @xmath26 samples . compared to the existing dynamic studies @xcite on the present model ,",
    "our work has employed bigger lattice size with one or two decades longer monte carlo steps of simulations . within the simulation time window",
    ", we have checked that there is no finite size effect on our simulation results .",
    "we first define the local order parameter @xmath27 and local energy @xmath28 for the model , and their respective sums @xmath29 and @xmath30 as m_i(t ) & & ( q ( _ i(t ) , _",
    "i(0))-1 ) , e_i(t ) - _ j^(i ) ( _ i(t ) , _",

    "i m_i(t ) , ( t ) _",
    "i e_i(t ) where @xmath31 denotes the sum over the nearest sites of the site @xmath32 .",
    "we have set @xmath33 in most of the present simulations . in the ner method ,",
    "the determination of the critical exponents involves the cumulants of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath34 and the energy density @xmath35 are given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively where @xmath38 is the total number of spins , and the angular bracket @xmath39 denotes average over different realizations of the time evolution .",
    "the ner method provides us with an efficient tool to determine @xmath15 with high accuracy .",
    "if the temperature @xmath40 is above or below @xmath15 , then the order parameter would relax _ ( stretched ) exponentially _ in time to its equilibrium value which is zero for @xmath41 , or nonzero for @xmath42 in the continuous transition as in the present model .",
    "the relaxation time scale @xmath43 depends on how close @xmath40 is to the critical temperature @xmath15 .",
    "approaching @xmath15 , @xmath43 exhibits a power law divergence .",
    "below @xmath15 , the order parameter @xmath34 relaxes toward the nonvanishing equilibrium value .",
    "since only at @xmath15 the order - parameter exhibits a power - law relaxation , @xmath15 can be located as the temperature at which the order - parameter relaxation gives the best straight line in a log - log plot of @xmath34 versus @xmath44 .",
    "more accurate location of @xmath15 naturally requires longer simulation time .",
    "since @xmath15 is exactly known for the present model , we can provide a test example how the order - parameter relaxation can be used to narrow down the critical temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) ( @xmath1 ) and fig",
    ".  1(b ) ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "figure  1a shows the relaxation of the ising ( @xmath1 ) order parameter for various temperatures near @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath34 shows strong upward and downward curvatures at @xmath45 and at @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "so the critical temperature should be in the range @xmath47 .",
    "we find in this way that the temperature range can be readily narrowed down to @xmath48 within the present simulation time ( @xmath25 mcs ) .",
    "that is , we have @xmath49 . higher accuracy would be achieved with longer simulation time . in the same manner , for @xmath3 ,",
    "@xmath15 can be easily located within the range @xmath50 as demonstrated in fig .",
    "in contrast to the case of the present system , the exact value of the critical energy is not known for many other systems . for such cases , using an ansatz of the critical energy relaxation at @xmath15 , one can determine @xmath16 by tuning the value of @xmath51 such that @xmath52 versus @xmath44 gives the best straight line at long times in the log - log plot .",
    "figure  2 shows such an example for the present system . in our simulation time window , one could readily narrow down @xmath16 within the range @xmath53 .",
    "we first measure the relaxation of the order parameter @xmath34 and the energy density @xmath35 . when the system is instantaneously brought to @xmath15 starting from a fully ordered state , both quantities exhibit power - law relaxations toward their equilibrium values @xcite . for better analysis of the relaxation behavior and estimation of the critical exponents , we included correction terms to the leading - order scaling behavior in the following form ( see appendix for a derivation of the leading - order critical relaxation ) m(t ) ~t^-/z ( 1++ + + ) , e_c - e(t ) ~t^-(d -1)/z ( 1++ + + ) where @xmath6 is the dynamic exponent , @xmath54 and @xmath55 the static exponents , and @xmath56 the spatial dimension ( @xmath57 in the present case ) . in ( 4 ) , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 ,",
    "@xmath63 are constants , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , etc are the exponents of the correction - to - scaling terms .",
    "simulation results for the relaxations of @xmath34 and @xmath66 are shown respectively in fig .",
    "3(a ) and fig .",
    "it is easy to see that the general form of eq .",
    "( 4 ) with all the correction exponents kept independent , is not appropriate for fitting .",
    "for example , if we put all the correction exponents equal to one another , then we can generate the same function with many different combinations of the coefficients provided that the sum of the coefficients are the same .",
    "this will cause the fitting procedure with a general initial guess to fail to converge to unique stable values for the values of exponents and other coefficients .",
    "therefore , we should impose some constraints on the correction exponents to achieve a stable fit .",
    "one of the schemes we tried is to let the first correction exponent to be a free fitting parameter but the @xmath67-th correction exponent are constrained to be equal to the first correction exponent plus @xmath68 .",
    "that is , we put @xmath69 and @xmath70 , etc ( which we call fit@xmath67a , where @xmath67 refers to the number of the correction terms ) .",
    "we also tried a scheme where the first correction exponent to be a free fitting parameter but the @xmath67-th correction exponents are constrained to be equal to @xmath67 times the first correction exponent .",
    "that is , we put @xmath71 and @xmath72 , etc ( which we call fit@xmath67c ) .",
    "a special scheme of correction is to assume an analytic form for the correction terms where the correction exponents are all constrained to integer values ( which we call fit@xmath67b ) .",
    "the cases of @xmath73 in fit@xmath67a and fit@xmath67c reduce to the scheme of fit@xmath67b .",
    "the special case of fitting with a simple power law without correction terms will be referred to as fit@xmath74 .",
    "first consider the case of @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", we incorporated up to third correction terms ( i.e. , fit3a , fit3c and fit3b ) in our fit . in the cases of fit3a and fit3c , for reasonable convergence of the fitting procedure and estimation of the errorbars , we tuned the value of the coefficients of the highest order correction terms ( i.e. , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "these values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 were tuned ( chosen ) such that the resulting fit function shows good agreement with the data .",
    "for some finite range of these coefficient values ( @xmath77 ranging from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ) , the quality of the fit is found to be acceptible .",
    "the median of the values of the exponents was chosen as the representative value of the exponent and the range of the values can be used to estimate the error bars . as for the relaxation of the magnetization",
    ", we found that , as the value of @xmath75 was varied , the value of the dominant relaxation exponent @xmath80 showed only small variation .",
    "we also found that , in terms of the value of the dominant exponent @xmath80 and the first correction exponents , the two schemes of fit3a and fit3c gave almost the same results ( see table ii ) . if we take the median of the fitted values from this analysis as the most probable value of @xmath81 , we get = 0.057722(42 ) q=2 .",
    "now the corresponding value of the first correction exponent @xmath64 from the above fit exhibits a monotonic increase from @xmath82 to @xmath83 ( fit3c ) and also from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ( fit3a ) as the value of @xmath77 increases from @xmath78 to @xmath79 ( table ii ) . taking the median of the combined range ( from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ) we may take the representive value of @xmath64 as @xmath86 .",
    "this may indicate that the exact value of the first correction exponent is equal to one .",
    "incidentally we also tried to fit the data with analytic corrections in which the first correction exponent is set to be equal to one , the second correction exponent two , etc .",
    "we found that the fitting quality was excellent with essentially the same dominant exponent as the representative value given above .",
    "as for the relaxation of the excess energy , we also applied the above fitting schemes .",
    "however , in this case of excess energy , we had to directly tune the value of the first correction exponent in order to obtain a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "we found that the best fit could be obtained in the range of the value of @xmath87 between @xmath84 and @xmath88 ( see table iii ) which again is in reasonable agreement with the case of the magnetization relaxation ( fig .",
    "the values of the fitted relaxation exponents are = 0.46227(71 ) q=2 .",
    "now we turn to the relaxation dynamics of @xmath3 model . as for the magnetization relaxation",
    ", we tuned the value of the coefficient @xmath75 or @xmath89 of the highest order correction terms .",
    "we find that both schemes fit3a and fit3c give approximately the same results for values of the relaxation exponent @xmath80 ( table iv ) .",
    "combining the results of fit3a and fit3c we obtain the values of the exponent as = 0.06020(17 ) q=3 .",
    "correspondingly the value of the first correction exponent @xmath64 ranges between @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "as for the relaxation of the excess energy , we also applied the above fitting schemes .",
    "we found that the best fit could be obtained in the range of the value of @xmath87 between @xmath92 and @xmath93 which exhibit a narrower range for the correction exponent compared with the case of magnetization relaxation .",
    "the value of the fitted relaxation exponent for excess energy is ( table v ) = 0.3626(40 ) q=3 .",
    "figures 3(c ) and 3(d ) show the time dependence of @xmath94 for @xmath1 and @xmath3 respectively together with the fitting functions . here",
    "@xmath95 represents the asymptotic scaling obtained from the fitting . also ,",
    "3(e ) and 3(f ) show the time dependence of @xmath96 with the fitted values of the exponents for @xmath1 and @xmath3 respectively together with the fitting functions , demonstrating the asymptotic nature of the scaling behaviors . here",
    "@xmath97 represents the asymptotic scaling obtained from the fitting .",
    "note that the value of @xmath98 is particularly small .",
    "this implies that the order - parameter relaxes much more slowly than the energy does : even after four decades of relaxation time , the order parameter relaxed only half of its initial value .",
    "this is another reason why the statistics is better for the order parameter relaxation than for the energy relaxation .",
    "the above values of @xmath98 for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be compared with the results obtained from the short - time dynamics both on square @xcite and triangular @xcite lattices .",
    "since @xmath98 and @xmath99 contain the common factor @xmath100 which involves the dynamic critical exponent @xmath6 , taking the ratio of the former to the latter eliminates the exponent @xmath6 , yielding @xmath101 which involves only the two static exponents .",
    "then the numerical values of the ratio @xmath101 obtained from the above fit can be compared with the corresponding exact values as & = & 0.1249(4 ) , ( ) _ = = 0.125 q=2 , + & = & 0.1660(23 ) , ( ) _ = = 0.16667 q=3 .",
    "we see that for both cases of @xmath1 and @xmath3 , the values of @xmath102 are quite close to the exact theoretical values .",
    "elimination of the dynamic exponent @xmath6 in the above ratio is an important feature that may be used to distinguish the universality class of systems whose critical properties are not known .",
    "prominent examples of such systems are the two - dimensional ffxy models @xcite .",
    "we point out that as is done here , measuring the relaxations of the chirality order parameter and the energy for such systems one can determine whether the chirality transition in that system belongs to the ising or the @xmath2-state potts universality class , or to another universality class , without knowing all the static exponents separately .",
    "one can obtain an estimate for @xmath6 from the fitted exponents for the relaxation of magnetization and energy as given above by making use of the fact that the static exponents are exactly known in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is perhaps one of the easiest ways of obtaining @xmath6 for systems whose static critical properties are exactly known @xcite .",
    "if we use the magnetization relaxation , the values for @xmath6 derived from the values of the relaxation exponents in ( 5)-(8 ) ( assuming the exact theoretical values of the static exponents ) are given by z_m & = & 2.1656(16 ) z_e = 2.1632(33 ) q=2 , + z_m & = & 2.2150(62 ) z_e = 2.2064(110 ) q=3 , here values of the exponents are the median values in the optimal fitting regime , while the error bars are estimated from the maximal dispersion of the fitted values .",
    "the above procedures of obtaining @xmath6 of course can not be carried out for systems with unknown critical properties .",
    "it is thus desirable to provide ways of independently measuring the dynamic exponent .",
    "we present below one systematic way of doing it by considering the second moments of the order parameter , @xmath103 , which exhibits a leading - order scaling behavior in time @xcite as ( see appendix ) c_mm(t ) n ~t^(d-2/)/z note that ( 11 ) is valid for _ disordered _ initial states as well .",
    "the dynamic exponent @xmath6 can be isolated if one considers a time - dependent second moment @xmath104 defined as f_mm(t ) ~t^d / z which is obtained using the leading - order behavior for @xmath34 given in ( 4 ) .",
    "one usually measures @xmath104 in two ways : one measures @xmath104 for fully ordered initial states , or one can first measure @xmath103 for disordered initial states , and then divide it by @xmath105 measured for the fully ordered initial states .",
    "the latter way is therefore using the two different types of initial conditions .",
    "we denote the former result by @xmath106 , and the latter one by @xmath107 .",
    "alternative way @xcite of obtaining @xmath6 using the short - time critical dynamics is described in the next section .    shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) and fig .",
    "4(b ) are @xmath104 for @xmath1 and @xmath3 , respectively . here",
    ", we apply similar methods of analysis as in the previous section .",
    "that is , @xmath108 , we found that for the case @xmath1 ( using both fit2a and fit2c ) @xmath106 and @xmath107 give ( table vi and vii ) z_ordered = 2.1545(52 ) , z_mixed=2.1668(19 ) q=2 .",
    "we see that there exists small but non - negligible discrepancy between the exponents @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we also note in particular that @xmath109 is very close to @xmath111 obtained from the relaxation of the magnetization in ( 5 ) ( assuming the exact values of the static exponents ) .",
    "figure  4(c ) shows the time dependence of the quantity @xmath112 for the case of mixed initial states ( for @xmath1 ) together with the fitting function , where @xmath113 represents the asymptotic scaling obtained from one of the best fits . in the case of @xmath3 , @xmath110 and @xmath109",
    "exhibit a larger discrepancy : z_ordered = 2.1334(35 ) , z_mixed=2.1735(40 ) q=3 as first pointed out by zheng @xcite , this difference between the two estimates is not due to the statistical error of the data .",
    "this difference is also observed in triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "more severe disagreement between @xmath110 and @xmath109 was reported for the baxter - wu model @xcite : @xmath114 @xcite and @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the underlying reason for this discrepancy is that the time scale at which the scaling behavior sets in , may be much longer for @xmath106 than that for @xmath107 as @xmath0 gets larger , which may be due to the nature of the broken symmetry of the initial states related to the higher degeneracy of the ground states for larger @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus expected that the stronger discrepancy will be observed for the @xmath116-state potts model as well .",
    "the values of dynamic critical exponents obtained from second moments of the order parameter can now be combined with the relations of exponents obtained from the relaxation of the first moments of the order parameter and energy to give the static exponents such as @xmath55 and @xmath54 . since it appears that the value of @xmath109 ( especially for @xmath1 ) is more consistent with the results of magnetization and energy relaxation , we substituted @xmath109 for the dynamic exponents in the relaxation of magnetization and energy .",
    "for example in the case of @xmath1 , substituting the value of @xmath117 in ( 13 ) for @xmath6 in the relations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) gives @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "these values yield close estimates to the exact exponents : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .    as for @xmath3 , when the value of @xmath122 in ( 14 ) is substituted for @xmath6 in the relations ( 7 ) and ( 8) we obtain @xmath123 and @xmath124 , which appears to exhibit approximate agreement with the exact values @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "but this is definitely less accurate than the case of @xmath1 .",
    "if we use @xmath110 instead of @xmath109 , then we obtain even less accurate results for the static exponents , which is naturally expected from the discrepancy of the value of @xmath110 from @xmath6 obtained from the relaxation of order parameter or energy assuming the exact static exponents .",
    "one thus should be cautious in determining @xmath6 from the second and higher moments of the order parameter for systems with unknown critical properties .",
    "we have so far followed the procedure of using the relaxations of the order parameter , the energy , and the second moment of the order - parameter .",
    "an alternative way @xcite of obtaining the exponent @xmath55 is to use the second - order moments involving energy fluctuations , @xmath127 or @xmath128 , which exhibit the leading - order scaling behaviors as @xcite ( see appendix ) f_me(t ) & & n ~t^1/z , + f_ee(t ) & & n ~t^/z for @xmath1 , we first obtain the leading - order exponent @xmath129 by using fit3a ( fig .",
    "however , we are unable to extract the exponent @xmath130 from @xmath128 since it exhibits a strong curvature with the local slope decreasing in time , as shown in fig",
    ".  5(b ) .",
    "this may indicate that the exponent @xmath131 eventually vanishes in the long time limit , implying @xmath132 .",
    "we suspect that this strong curvature in the log - log plot of @xmath128 may correspond to a logarithmic correction .",
    "figure  5(c ) shows such a fit with @xmath133 with @xmath134 . from the value of the above exponent @xmath129 we obtain @xmath135 using @xmath117 .",
    "this estimate compares quite well with that obtained from @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath104 .    for @xmath3 , in contrast to the ising ( @xmath1 ) case , both moments @xmath127 and @xmath128 exhibit asymptotic power - law behavior .",
    "the average slopes obtained from fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) are given by @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "these values yield the static and dynamic exponents @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "it is interesting to see that this dynamic exponent is larger than @xmath140 given in ( 14 ) , and is rather closer to those given in ( 10 ) .",
    "however , one should also note that the error bars are much larger in this case .",
    "one can therefore conclude that for the present system using the relaxation of the order parameter and the energy combined with the value of @xmath109 yields better estimates for static exponents than using the second - order moments involving the energy fluctuations . from this point of view , the moments @xmath127 and @xmath128 may be used to check the consistency of the results obtained using the energy relaxation itself .      at this point , for comparison , it is worthwhile to briefly describe the method using the short - time critical dynamics which offers an alternative way of determining the static and dynamic exponents .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite . when quenched to @xmath15 from the initial disordered state but with sufficiently small magnetization @xmath141 ,",
    "the system exhibits a nonequilibrium scaling regime in which the order parameter typically shows an anomalous power - law increase as @xcite m(t ) ~m_0 t^ before eventually relaxing toward its equilibrium value , where the exponent @xmath142 is a new nonequilibrium critical exponent .",
    "though it typically takes a positive value , it becomes negative for some systems such as the tricritical system @xcite , the ashkin - teller model @xcite , the blume - capel model @xcite , the @xmath116-state potts model @xcite , and for the bw model @xcite .",
    "the time scale @xmath143 associated with the power - law increase depends upon the magnitude of the initial magnetization as @xmath144 where the scaling dimension @xmath145 is related to the other exponents as @xmath146 .    in practice ,",
    "@xmath142 was obtained by linearly extrapolating the effective exponents @xmath147 ( for finite @xmath141 ) vs. @xmath141 to @xmath148 .",
    "alternative way of obtaining @xmath142 was first proposed by huse @xcite .",
    "using a scaling ansatz for the nonequilibrium structure factor of the two - dimensional kinetic ising model , huse has shown that the auto - correlation function of the global order - parameter @xmath29 with random initial conditions exhibits a power - law behavior _",
    "m(t ) m(0 ) > ~t^ huse has also shown that the spin auto - correlation function @xmath149 exhibits a critical decay in time as a(t ) < _ i ( ( _ i(0 ) , _",

    "it is much more convenient to measure @xmath142 by measuring the auto - correlation @xmath150 since one is free from cumbersome preparation of the initial states with very small magnetization and an extrapolation procedure to vanishing initial magnetization .",
    "the new nonequilibrium exponent @xmath142 has been obtained as follows . for @xmath1 , @xmath151 ( heat bath ) and @xmath152 ( metropolis ) using ( 16 ) @xcite , and @xmath153 using ( 17 ) @xcite .",
    "in addition , grassberger @xcite also measured the exponent @xmath142 as @xmath154 using a damage spreading method .",
    "likewise , for @xmath3 , the exponent @xmath142 takes the following values : @xmath155 ( heat bath ) and @xmath156 ( metropolis ) using ( 16 ) @xcite , and @xmath157 using ( 17 ) @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath142 was also measured using ( 17 ) as @xmath158 @xcite for a nonequilibrium cellular automaton model with @xmath159 symmetry which belongs to the @xmath2-state potts universality class @xcite .",
    "in addition , there exists measured value of @xmath142 for @xmath160 using both ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , which are given respectively by @xmath161 and @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting fact that the @xmath116-state potts model and the bw model , which belong to the same static universality class , do not share the same nonequilibrium exponent @xmath142 : @xmath163 @xcite or @xmath164 @xcite for the bw model .",
    "it would be interesting as well to clarify the question as to whether this nonuniversal dynamic behavior is extended to the case of @xmath6 in both systems .",
    "independent measurements of the exponents @xmath142 and @xmath165 using ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) provide an alternative way @xcite of obtaining @xmath6 through the relation @xmath166 .",
    "the measured values of @xmath165 and hence @xmath6 are given by @xmath167 and @xmath168 for @xmath1 , and @xmath169 and @xmath170 for @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "as for the bw model , @xmath171 and @xmath172 @xcite were obtained using the continuous - time monte carlo algorithm .",
    "one disadvantage of this method is that the rather large value of @xmath165 induces strong fluctuations in its measurement , which is the main source of the error for the estimate of @xmath6 .",
    "with @xmath6 in hand , one can use ( 11 ) with disordered initial states to obtain the ratio @xmath173 , or equivalently , the exponent @xmath174 ( for @xmath57 ) . in order to determine @xmath54 and @xmath55 separately , one can use the following scaling ansatz for the order parameter near and below @xmath15 m(t , ) = t^-/z f(t^1/z ) where @xmath175 is the scaling function , and @xmath176 is the reduced temperature defined as @xmath177 .",
    "the equation ( 19 ) reduces to ( 4 ) for @xmath178",
    ". then one can give an estimate for @xmath179 using m(t , ) |_=0 = t^1/z ( ( x))_=0 this method gives @xmath180 ( square lattice ) @xcite and @xmath181 ( triangular lattice ) @xcite for @xmath1 , and @xmath182 ( square lattice ) @xcite and @xmath183 ( triangular lattice ) @xcite for @xmath3 .",
    "but , involving the difference of the order parameter at several close temperatures near @xmath15 may cause considerable error in the estimate of the exponent @xmath55 .",
    "our method ( pesented in section iii.c ) utilizing the energy relaxation can provide an alternative and better way of estimating the exponent @xmath55 without using ( 20 ) .",
    "through monte carlo simulations we have investigated the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the ferromagnetic @xmath0-state potts model on a square lattice .",
    "primary purpose of the present work was to evaluate how accurate estimates the ner method can provide for both static and dynamic exponents of the statistical systems .",
    "the ferromagnetic potts model is an ideal test system for that purpose since the static critical properties of the model are exactly known .",
    "in contrast to other nonequilibrium approaches , we utilized both the order parameter and energy relaxation .",
    "the ratio of the power - law exponents of the order parameter and the energy involves solely the static exponents . in order to separately measure the two independent static exponents , one first measures the dynamic exponent @xmath6 by considering the order - parameter moments starting from either random or fully ordered initial states .",
    "it is found that in the present model , when the fully ordered initial states are employed , the time scale associated with the asymptotic scaling for the relaxation of the second moments of the order parameter sets in , seems to be much longer for higher @xmath0 than that for the disordered initial states and may exceed the present simulation time window . as a result ,",
    "the slopes obtained from the second moments of the order parameter may differ .",
    "one thus has to be very careful in obtaining the dynamic exponent @xmath6 from the time - dependent moments for the order parameter . once @xmath6 is determined , the two independent exponents @xmath55 and @xmath54 can be determined from the relaxation of the energy and the order parameter , respectively .",
    "the present work has demonstrated that , in the case of @xmath1 ( ising ) model this method can provide accurate estimates for the static and dynamic exponents provided that , as mentioned above , special care is taken in the choice of the initial states for the estimation of the dynamic exponent @xmath6 .",
    "for example the dynamic exponent @xmath109 obtained from the relaxation of the second moment of the order parameter with disordered initial states are more consistent with the relaxation of the order parameter and excess energy when the exact values of the static exponents are assumed . in the case of @xmath3 potts model , even though the static exponents obtained with the same methods are less accurate than in the case of @xmath1 , they still show reasonable agreement with the exact known values of the static exponents .",
    "the fact that the dynamic exponent @xmath6 does not appear in the ratio of the power - law exponents of the order parameter and energy , may be used to clarify the nature of the phase transition whose critical properties are under debate .",
    "an outstanding example is the phase transition associated with the chirality order in the ffxy models .",
    "the relaxations of the order parameter and energy are expected to become slower for frustrated systems .",
    "hence the above ratio can be measured with higher accuracy .",
    "we therefore tend to believe that once the critical temperature is accurately determined , the critical relaxations of the order parameter and energy for the chirality phase transition can tell whether the phase transition belongs to the ising universality class , or to the @xmath2-state potts class , or else to an entirely different universality class .",
    "we are grateful to prof .",
    "jooyoung lee for generously allowing us to access the gene cluster at at korea institute for advanced study ( kias ) where part of the computations were carried out .",
    "the critical relaxations of the order parameter and energy , and their higher moments can be obtained from the following scaling behavior of the nonequilibrium generating function @xmath184 which reduces to the equilibrium free energy density in the limit @xmath185 : ( , h , t)&= & b^-d ( b^y_t , h b^y_h , t b^-z ) + & = & t^-d / z ( t^y_t / z , h t^y_h / z , 1 ) where @xmath186 is the scaling factor , @xmath187 the reduced temperature difference , and @xmath188 the external ( magnetic ) field coupled to the order parameter .",
    "the above result was first derived by suzuki @xcite . in ( a.1 ) , @xmath189 and @xmath190 are the scaling dimensions associated respectively with temperature and external field , which are given by @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the relaxation of the order parameter @xmath34 at @xmath15 is obtained by differentiating the generating function @xmath184 with respect to the magnetic field @xmath188 : m(t)= ( ) _ = h=0 ~t^(y_h - d)/z = t^-/z likewise , the energy relaxation is obtained from the derivative of the generating function with respect to the reduced temperature @xmath176 : ( e(t)-e_c ) = ( ) _ = h=0 ~t^(y_t - d)/z = t^-(d-1)/z = t^-(1-)/z where the hyperscaling relation @xmath193 was used in the last equality .",
    "the equations ( a.2 ) and ( a.3 ) gives the leading order part of ( 4 ) .",
    "the second order moment of the order - parameter is accordingly obtained by differentiating twice @xmath194 with respect to @xmath188 : = < m^2(t)>-m^2(t)= ( ) _ = h=0 ~t^(2 y_h -d)/z = t^(d-2/)/z the equation ( a.4 ) gives ( 11 ) .",
    "finally , the cross - moment of the order parameter and energy is given by = ( ) _ = h=0 ~ t^(y_t+y_h - d)/z = t^(1-)/z dividing @xmath195 by @xmath34 gives ~t^1/z the equation ( a.7 ) yields the first member of ( 15 ) .",
