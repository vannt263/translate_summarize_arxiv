    "we exploit this property by assigning different distributions to different classes .",

    "a user belongs to class @xmath2 with probability  @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 .",
    "users transmit to the  receiver over a shared medium . the time is divided into _ frames _ , consisting of @xmath5 slots of equal duration .",
    "we assume that all users are frame- and slot - synchronized , which can be achieved by implementing a suitable signaling , as specified , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "each user transmits one message per frame by mapping it to a physical layer packet and repeating it @xmath6 times ( @xmath7 is a random number selected according to a predefined distribution ) in slots chosen uniformly at random within a frame .",
    "every packet contains pointers to its copies , so that , once a packet is successfully decoded , full information about the location of the copies is available .",
    "a slot is called a singleton slot if it contains only one packet .",
    "if it contains more packets , we say that a collision occurs .",
    "first , the receiver decodes the packets in singleton slots and obtains the location of their copies .",
    "as soon as a packet is decoded , the channel coefficients associated with its copies can be accurately estimated  @xcite . after subtracting the interference caused by the identified copies , decoding proceeds until no further singleton slots are found .",
    "we assume perfect channel estimation and interference cancellation , as motivated by physical layer simulations in  @xcite .",
    "the described system can be represented by a bipartite graph , in which users and slots are represented by and , respectively , and transmissions are represented by edges .",
    "a node is said to have the degree @xmath6 if it has @xmath6 incident edges .",
    "the decoding process is similar to the peeling decoding of low - density parity - check codes over the binary erasure channel  @xcite .",
    "we define the channel load as @xmath8 .",
    "is modeled as a random variable by averaging over the distribution of @xmath0 . ]",
    "if the receiver fails to decode a packet from a user , we say that the user is unresolved .",
    "the average number of unresolved users in class @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath9 . in this letter , we analyze the for each user class as a function of @xmath10 , defined as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the average number of users in class  @xmath2 .",
    "the performance of the system greatly depends on the that users use to choose the degree @xmath6 .",
    "this is referred to as the degree distribution and is specified in the form of a polynomial as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability of choosing degree @xmath6 for a user in class @xmath2 and @xmath15 is the maximum degree .",
    "typically , @xmath16 .",
    "for later use , we define the average degree distribution as @xmath17      for standard single - class , the performance exhibits a threshold behavior when @xmath18 , i.e. , all but a vanishing fraction of the users are resolved if the channel load is below a certain threshold value , denoted by @xmath19 and obtained by  @xcite .",
    "analogously , for multi - class csa , we define @xmath20 to be the threshold for class-@xmath2 users , i.e. , the largest channel load for which all but a vanishing fraction of class-@xmath2 users are resolved .",
    "the following proposition shows that the thresholds for all classes coincide and can be obtained by means of single - edge - type .",

    "an edge connected to a class @xmath2 vn is called a type-@xmath2 edge .",
    "we define the edge - perspective degree distribution for class @xmath2 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the probability that a type-@xmath2 edge is incident to a degree-@xmath6 vn . the edge - perspective degree distribution for class @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath30 ,",
    "is similarly defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the probability that an edge is connected to a with @xmath6 type-@xmath2 edges .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , using the definition of the poisson distribution we can show that @xmath35 , i.e. , the edge - perspective cn degree follows a poisson distribution .",

    "the probability that a selected cn sends an erasure back to a vn of class @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath38 , can then be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of type-@xmath2 edges connected to the cn and @xmath41 denotes expectation . since @xmath40 , @xmath42 are independent poisson random variables , the probability in   can be written as @xmath43 using the fact that @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath44 since the right - hand side of   is independent of @xmath2 , we conclude that @xmath45 and to simplify the notation , we set @xmath46 . since @xmath26 is a poisson distribution with mean @xmath27 , we can express @xmath47 as @xmath48    a class-@xmath2 sends an erasure back if all incoming messages are erased , which occurs with probability @xmath49 substituting   into   gives @xmath50 since the number of type-@xmath2 edges is @xmath51 , we have @xmath52 inserting the obtained result into   gives @xmath53 where the last step follows from the linearity of the derivative .",
    "hence , @xmath47 tends to zero as @xmath54 if the condition in   is satisfied .",
    "finally , the probability of a class-@xmath2 vn to be erased at the @xmath37th decoding iteration is given by @xmath55 hence , @xmath56 for @xmath57 if @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath57 if @xmath60 , which proves that the threshold is the same for all classes .",
    "we remark that proposition 1 is also valid if the fraction of users in each class is fixed as in  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to verify that  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 18 ) ) can be reduced to  . since the thresholds for different classes coincide , we conclude that provides little support for the design of multi - class csa systems and one needs to look at the finite frame length performance instead .",

    "the analysis of stopping sets allows to accurately predict the for standard  @xcite . in this letter , we extend these results to multi - class .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the probability that a degree-@xmath6 user is not resolved by the receiver .",
    "we can then easily derive the for class-@xmath2 users as @xmath63 which can be seen as a generalization of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 10 ) ) to the multi - class case .",
    "an approximation of @xmath62 in the region can be obtained as  @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the set of the considered stopping sets , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the number of variable and check nodes in @xmath61 , respectively , @xmath68 is the number of degree-@xmath69 variable nodes in @xmath61 , and @xmath70 is the number of graphs isomorphic with @xmath61 .",
    "we remark that the analysis in  @xcite is based on enumerating stopping sets and is able to predict the for @xmath71 at low - to - moderate channel loads .",
    "to predict the for larger @xmath6 , the set of considered stopping sets needs to be extended .",
    "in this section , we provide an efficient method to design good distributions for multi - class which satisfy specified constraints ( for a given @xmath5 , @xmath10 , and @xmath3 , @xmath72 ) . for simplicity , we consider only two classes of users .",
    "ideally , we would like to design distributions that provide the required level of reliability at the highest possible channel load .",
    "unfortunately , the analytical approximation is inaccurate for large channel loads .",
    "hence , we resort to a heuristic optimization based on the threshold and the approximation , which was shown to be useful in  @xcite . without loss of generality",
    ", we assume that class @xmath73 requires higher reliability .",
    "the requirements for class @xmath74 are described by the target plr @xmath75 at a specific channel load @xmath76 . to reduce the search space ,",
    "we restrict the distributions to be in the form @xmath77 . by limiting to these degrees ,",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that large thresholds can be obtained , while reasonably low can be provided by carefully controlling the fraction of degree-@xmath78 users  @xcite .",
    "we numerically solve the following optimization problem @xmath79 by means of the nelder - mead simplex algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we use   together with the approximation   to estimate the plr for the two classes .",
    "we remark that   gives an accurate prediction for low - to - medium channel loads , hence , @xmath76 should not be too large to make the optimization problem meaningful .",
    "the employed optimization algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial value of the distributions .",
    "we solve this problem by uniformly sampling the search space with a step @xmath80 and running the optimization multiple times .",
    "the results of the optimization for two values of @xmath81 and different values of @xmath75 are presented in  table  [ tab : opt_distr ] .",
    "the frame length is set to @xmath82 and the target channel load is @xmath83 .",
    "it can be seen that the larger @xmath81 , the smaller the threshold since the average plr requirements are stricter .",
    "we can also observe that in most of the cases @xmath84 and @xmath85 to guarantee a low error floor , whereas @xmath86 is close to zero to keep the threshold reasonably large .",
    "the main goal of the optimization is therefore to carefully select parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "[ tab : opt_distr ]    the performance of the optimized distributions for @xmath89 is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_r14 ] .",
    "solid lines show simulation results and dashed lines show the analytical predictions in   based on  .",
    "we note that the plr requirements are met by the analytical approximations .",
    "however , the actual performance violates the requirements in most of the cases , hence , @xmath76 needs to be selected with this consideration in mind .",
    "it can also be seen from the figures that for low target plrs ( i.e. , relatively low values of the threshold ) the simulated curves have a more pronounced waterfall and agree well with the analytical curves in the region . from  fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_r14](a ) we can also see that relaxed plr requirements result in a higher threshold . however , the mismatch between simulations and analytical results increases in this case .",
    "hence , the actual performance is farther away from the target plr .",
    "similar effect is observed when the requirements are very strict and the waterfall begins at channel loads lower than @xmath76 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_r14](d ) .",
    "we also remark that the waterfall regions of the plr curves for different classes start at approximately the same channel load , which confirms proposition  1 . the difference between the waterfall regions ( especially pronounced in  fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_r14](a ) due to a high threshold ) is caused by the finite frame length regime .",
    "simulation results for other values of @xmath81 and @xmath5 ( not included here ) show very similar behavior .",
    "[ fig : sim_r14 ]",
    "in this section , we analyze the decoding delay for users from different classes . when considering framed versions of csa it is usually assumed that the receiver first receives the entire frame and then performs decoding .",
    "assuming further that signal processing does not introduce any delay , i.e. , decoding , channel estimation , and are instantaneous , the decoding delay is equal to the frame duration if a user is resolved and it is not defined otherwise .    here , to provide faster decoding",
    ", we use the slot - based decoder proposed in  @xcite for frameless csa . in frameless csa  @xcite",
    ", it is essential that the receiver attempts decoding continuously on a slot - by - slot basis since the contention needs to be terminated once a certain criterion is satisfied .",
    "we can use this decoder also in our scenario to provide faster decoding of the users .",
    "the decoding delay , denoted by @xmath90 , is then a that is equal to the number of slots the receiver needs to observe to decode a user . for convenience , we normalize it by the frame length .",
    "predicting analytically the decoding delay of the slot - based decoder is difficult in general .",
    "obviously , it can be upperbouded by the frame duration .",
    "moreover , the delay can be easily analyzed at asymptotically low channel loads , i.e. , when @xmath91 . to that end , we assume that a single user is present in the system and it selects degree @xmath6 according to a degree distribution . the decoding delay for this user is denoted by @xmath92 and it is equal to the smallest slot number that the user chooses for transmission normalized by the frame length @xmath5 . assuming that @xmath18 , the distribution of @xmath92 , denoted by @xmath93 , is the distribution of the minimum of @xmath6 independent and uniformly distributed on @xmath94 $ ] and it is given by @xmath95 the mean of @xmath92 for a degree-@xmath6 user is @xmath96 .",
    "the average delay for class @xmath2 at asymptotically low channel load , denoted by @xmath97 , can be calculated as @xmath98    finding the distribution of the delay for @xmath99 is not easy and should take collisions into account .",
    "their effect is twofold . in the region ,",
    "nearly all collisions are resolvable , and hence , they only postpone decoding of the colliding users . at high channel loads ,",
    "colliding users create stopping sets and these users are excluded from the delay estimation , which results in changing the statistics of the delay .",
    "we therefore resort to simulations to estimate the decoding delay for channel loads larger than zero .",

    "[ fig : delay_pdf ] . in  fig .",
    "[ fig : delay_mean ] , we show the estimated average delay as a function of the channel load . it is observed that class-1 users experience faster decoding than class-2 users .",
    "for example , at @xmath100 class-1 users are resolved after @xmath101 slots on average , whereas class-2 users are resolved after observing half a frame .",
    "however , the difference disappears as @xmath102 .",
    "it is worth noting that only resolved users are accounted for when calculating the delay .",
    "the decoding delay for @xmath103 is not of interest since very few users are resolved . the analytical delays @xmath104 and @xmath105 when @xmath91 are shown with black dots and they agree well with the simulation results .",
    "the simulation results also indicate that the gap between the delay curves for different classes is consistent in the low - to - moderate load region , rendering the analytical results useful even for @xmath99 .",
