    "we end this introduction by stating some questions that arise naturally from the main theorem .",

    "given a compact metrizable topological space  @xmath13 and a continuous map  @xmath14 , the main theorem implies that there is a parameter  @xmath17 $ ] and an affine homeomorphism  @xmath34 between the space of invariant probability measures supported on  @xmath33 .",

    "this type of problem is very well understood in the setting of minimal cantor systems : giordano , putnam , and skau have shown in  @xcite that for two minimal cantor systems  @xmath37 and @xmath38 there exists a homeomorphism @xmath39 that induces an affine homeomorphism between the corresponding spaces of invariant probability measures , if , and only if ,  @xmath37 and  @xmath40 are `` orbit equivalent '' : there is a homeomorphism between  @xmath13 and  @xmath41 mapping each orbit of  @xmath15 to an orbit of  @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , to each minimal cantor system  @xmath37 one can associate a dimension group that is a complete invariant for the orbit equivalence relation  @xcite : two minimal cantor systems are orbit equivalent if , and only if , the corresponding dimension groups are isomorphic as ordered groups with unit . and",
    "taking values in  @xmath43 , by the subgroup of functions whose integral with respect to each invariant measure vanishes ; the positive cone is the set of those classes containing a function taking values in  @xmath44 , and the unit is the class of the constant function equal to  1 .",
    "see for example  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.13 ) . ]",
    "it is thus natural to look for a special class of minimal cantor systems realizing all of the orbit equivalent classes .",
    "since the dimension group associated to each toeplitz flow contains the dimension group of an odometer as a subgroup ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.1 ) , the class of toeplitz flows is not sufficient to realize all orbit equivalence classes , in spite of the fact that this class realizes all the non - empty metrizable choquet simplices as sets of invariant probability measures  @xcite .",
    "so the question remains whether minimal post - critical sets of logistic maps realize all orbit equivalence classes . in order to formulate a precise question we will consider natural extensions to stay in the class of minimal cantor systems , and use the generalized odometer associated to a kneading map , see    [ ss : unimodal ] , [ ss : kneading odometer ] for definitions .",
    "does every orbit equivalence class contain the natural extension of a generalized odometer associated to a kneading map ?",
    "does every uniquely ergodic orbit equivalence class contain the natural extension of a generalized odometer associated to a kneading map ?",

    "although corollary  [ c : extreme realization ] is stronger than  ( * ? ?",

    "furthermore the kneading map satisfies for every  @xmath46 the inequality  @xmath47 ( part  1 of lemma  [ l : doubly resonant kneading ] ) , and therefore every full family of unimodal maps , as well as the family of symmetric tent maps , contains a unimodal map whose kneading map is  @xmath45 . for the case of finite dimensional choquet simplices",
    "see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark  1 ) .",

    "we describe the logistic maps in the main theorem through their associated `` kneading map '' , see   [ ss : unimodal ] for the definition of kneading map and further background on unimodal maps .",
    "in fact , the conclusions of the main theorem are valid for each unimodal map having the same kneading map as  @xmath12 . to ensure that the post - critical set is a cantor set where the unimodal map is minimal , it is enough to require that the kneading map diverges to  @xmath48 ( proposition  [ p : continuous unimodal ] ) .    in   [ ss : doubly resonant kneading ]",
    "we introduce a class of kneading maps that diverge to  @xmath49 .",
