    "the quantum states with non - gaussian wigner function are also quite important .",
    "for example , a single - photon state , which finds many applications in quantum information processing , shows non - gaussian behavior in phase - space . in a recent experiment ,",
    "a non - gaussian state has been produced by homodyne detection technique from a single - mode squeezed state of light @xcite . for certain non - gaussian states",
    ", wigner functions can take negative values .",
    "such negativity refers to nonclassicality of these states .",
    "these states are useful in entanglement distillation @xcite , loophole - free tests of bell s inequality @xcite , and quantum computing @xcite .",
    "a specific class of such nonclassical states has been shown to be similar to the schrodinger kitten state , in the sense that their wigner functions show negativity at the origin of phase space @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the schrodinger cat states @xcite , which are quantum superpositions of coherent states , are non - classical in nature and are very important to study the interface of quantum and classical worlds .",
    "superposition of coherent states with low amplitudes creates schrodinger kitten states .",
    "most of the experiments to prepare the schrodinger cat states have been performed in cavities or bound systems .",
    "thus they are not much useful in quantum information networks though they have the non - gaussian nature which is required in certain quantum communication protocols . in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown how to prepare an schrodinger kitten state in an optical system , by subtracting a single photon from a squeezed vacuum state .",
    "this optical kitten state would overcome the limitations of bound systems .",
    "repeated photon - subtractions can lead to conditional generation of arbitrary single - mode state @xcite .",
    "we note that similar non - gaussian states could be prepared by adding a single photon to a squeezed vacuum state ( see @xcite for details of photon - added coherent states , which are also non - gaussian states ) .",
    "these states are equivalent to single - photon subtracted squeezed vacuum state and exhibit similar behavior in phase space .",
    "it is worth to mention that non - gaussian two - mode entangled states can be prepared by subtracting a photon from a two - mode squeezed state @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we derive a compact expression of the wigner function and find the region in phase space where it becomes negative .",
    "we show that there is an upper bound of the squeezing parameter for this state to exhibit sub - poissonian statistics . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the effects of two different model of decoherence : photon - number decay and phase damping . in both cases ,",
    "we derive analytical expressions for the time - evolution of the state and its wigner function .",

    "note that the photon - subtracted squeezed states are similar to schrodinger kitten states @xcite because wigner functions exhibit the same characteristics in phase - space especially for the large values of the squeezing parameters .",
    "moreover , in both cases , wigner function becomes negative in the center of phase space .",
    "the nonclassicality of the state @xmath35 can also be analyzed by studying its sub - poissonian character in terms of the mandel s",

    "we emphasize that the wigner function has negative region for all values of @xmath42 , and thus the photon - subtracted squeezed state is nonclassical for all @xmath42 , though it does not exhibit sub - poissonian photon statistics above certain squeezing threshold .",
    "we next consider how this state evolves under decoherence .",
    "the decoherence of the single - mode state ( [ odd ] ) can be due to decay of photons to the reservoir or due to phase damping .      when the photons decay to reservoir , the corresponding markovian dynamics of the state is well described by the following equation : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rate of decay .",

    "@xmath76 which becomes negative when @xmath77 becomes negative .",
    "this leads to the following condition : @xmath78 which is independent of the squeezing parameter @xmath42 .",

    "however the negative value does depend on the squeezing parameter .",
    "we find from eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) that at @xmath80 ( i.e , when @xmath81 ) , @xmath73 becomes a circle in phase space .",

    "we next study the time - evolution of the wigner function for the case of large squeezing , i.e. , large values of @xmath88 . in this case",
    "the single photon subtracted squeezed state becomes similar to a schrodinger cat state .",

    "we now study the effect of phase - damping on the state @xmath35 .",
    "such damping can be described by the following master equation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number operator and @xmath91 is the corresponding rate of decoherence .",
    "the solution of this equation can be easily found as ( [ sol ] ) where @xmath92\\rho_{n , n'}(0)\\;.\\ ] ] it is easy to see that only the diagonal elements @xmath93 do not decay due to dephasing .",

    "it is interesting to note that all the fock states have independent contributions to the wigner function at long times , weighted by their initial population @xmath102 . on the other hand , in case of decoherence due to photon - number decay , only the vacuum state survives . in fig .",
    "[ wig_phase_fig ] , we plot the wigner function ( [ wigner_phase ] ) in phase space for different squeezing .",
    "note that the wigner function has negative region at long times representing nonclassicality for all @xmath42 , even if the state does not exhibit sub - poissonian statistics for @xmath103 ( because @xmath36 is positive ) .",
    "in fact , if @xmath36 is positive , it does not mean that the the state is classical .",
    "in such cases , we have to use other parameters to test the nonclassicality .",
    "several parameters have been introduced in this context @xcite .",
    "we can use hierarchy of these parameters which have been shown to be especially useful in context of cat states . here",
    "we illustrate the utility of one such parameter , e.g. , the @xmath104 parameter as defined by @xcite @xmath105}{{\\rm det}[\\mu^{(3)}]-{\\rm det}[m^{(3)}]}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath106 @xmath107 , @xmath108 and det indicates determinant of the matrix .",
    "the state exhibits phase - insensitive nonclassical properties if @xmath104 lies between 0 and -1 @xcite .",
    "for the state @xmath35 we have found that @xmath104 remains negative for @xmath109 which corresponds to @xmath110 .",
    "clearly @xmath104 is a stronger measure of nonclassicality than @xmath36 because it leads to a larger upper bound of @xmath42 to exhibit nonclassicality .",
    "further , comparing the wigner functions in figs .",
    "[ wig_phase_fig ] with those at @xmath111 [ see figs . [ sq_figs ] ] , we find that the wigner function varies very slowly with time for small squeezing .",
    "but for large squeezing , the variation is faster . although we can conclude that phase damping leads to much slower decoherence than amplitude damping",
    "in conclusion , we have studied how a class of non - gaussian states evolves in presence of decoherence .",
    "we have considered a single - photon subtracted squeezed vacuum state , the wigner function of which is similar to that of a schrodinger kitten state .",
    "we have found an upper bound for squeezing parameter for which this state exhibits sub - poissonian photon statistics .",
    "however , the state remains nonclassical for all values of the squeezing parameter because the wigner function becomes negative around central region in phase space .",

    "we have found analytical expressions for the time - evolution of the state and the wigner function in both cases . in case of amplitude decay ,",
    "the wigner function loses its non - gaussian nature and becomes gaussian at long times , corresponding to vacuum .",
