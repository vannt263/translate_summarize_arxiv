    "the baby skyrme model is an important member of the family of nonlinear field theories .",
    "although it was proposed as a simplified version of the skyrme model , it is used to model some real - world systems , see  @xcite ,  @xcite and references therein . from the formal point of view",
    ", the theory describes dynamical maps between two spheres @xmath0 .",
    "this gives rise to a non - trivial topological structure and most efforts were done in this domain .",
    "however , in this paper we shall put the topological questions aside since the trivial topological sector is also quite interesting , see  @xcite . if a customary field potential is chosen , there is an additional , apart from the topological charge , quantity untouched by the time evolution . in the scalar field formulation",
    "it is simply the @xmath1 charge .",
    "its presence validates the question about existence of q - balls , solutions known in many theories to minimize the energy for a given value of charge .",
    "+ the present work aims at clarifying some findings described in  @xcite . in that paper c.  adam  _ et al .",
    "_ report on existence of both spinning and non - spinning compact q - balls in the baby skyrme model with a v - shaped potential .",
    "some of these solutions , called peakons , have a peculiar shape  the value of the second derivative at their maxima becomes extremely large .",
    "these observations come from numerics and some of them lack satisfactory analytical explanation . in the present paper we shed some light on them .",
    "first , we identify a structure in equation for the q - ball profile function responsible for the appearance of peakons .",
    "second , we describe qualitatively the existence domain of the non - spinning q - balls in the theory . on the way , difficulties with the customary small parameter expansion in theories with non smooth field force are discussed .",
    "+ we consider a sharp potential associated with the signum - gordon model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) giving rise to compact solutions and requiring a matching procedure .",
    "some objections to the potential has been risen in  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the article  @xcite may be read as an apologia for such potentials .",
    "the solutions described in the present paper are legitimate weak solutions to a differential equation , a discussion of this fact may be found in  @xcite .",
    "another attitude toward the potential is also possible .",
    "then it holds as an idealization , where the close - to - the - vacuum effects are neglected .",
    "the results in  @xcite suggest that a regularization of the potential would not change seriously the below described solutions .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . after a short introductory section",
    "we discuss the well - posedness problem of the equation for the q - ball profile function .",
    "this issue is intimately connected to the appearance of peakons . in the next section",
    "we give an account of our futile attempt to formulate a small parameter expansion for q - balls in the theory at hand .",
    "a natural and well working approximation is introduced in the section 5 .",
    "it makes it possible to characterize the q - ball dependence on parameters present in the equation .",
    "the last section contains our conclusions and remarks .",
    "let us consider the following lagrange density function : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a complex scalar field , @xmath4 its complex conjugation and @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the above form of the lagrangian in three @xmath8 dimensional minkowski space - time defines the baby skyrme model in the scalar field formulation , for details see @xcite .",
    "the last term in the lagrangian is a field potential . in this paper",

    "+ we shall consider solutions of the model set by  ( [ lagrange ] ) found with help of the spinning q - ball ansatz : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are radial and angle coordinates , @xmath14 is a real valued function and finally @xmath15 is an integer . in  @xcite it is pointed out , that for small amplitudes the theory reduces to the signum - gordon model .",
    "this fact suggests writing the equation in a form corresponding to the _ on - shell _ scaling symmetry present in the signum - gordon theory .",
    "rescaled variable @xmath16 and function @xmath17 should be appropriate and lead to some simplifications . in this",
    "setting we obtain the equation @xmath18= g\\left(\\frac{n^{2}}{y^{2}}-1\\right ) \\left(1+\\frac{\\kappa\\gamma { g'}^{2 } } { \\left(1+\\kappa^{2}g^{2}\\right)^{2}}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\",

    "henceforth we consider the equation ( [ gen - eq ] ) for @xmath37 .",
    "we rewrite it in a form convenient to further analysis @xmath38 the left - hand side of the above equation does not depend on the specific potential and is peculiar to the q - ball ansatz in the baby skyrme model .",
    "it is a differential equation of the second order , hence for given @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 we should be able to set uniquely @xmath42 . but this is not true for some values of @xmath29 .",
    "the above form of the equation makes this evident : the factors multiplying @xmath43 and @xmath44 may be simultaneously set to zero .",
    "we shall argue below that this lack of well - posedness gives rise to peakons . to this end",
    "we examine solutions of  ( [ nto0 ] ) in a vicinity of @xmath45 , where @xmath45 satisfies @xmath46 as for the number of roots of the above relation and their dependence on the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 see figure  [ roots1 ] . for convenience",

    "hence , @xmath56 sets the scale but its exact value is not crucial .",

    "consider @xmath70 . if @xmath62 then @xmath67 has a maximum , otherwise minimum .",
    "note , that the smaller absolute value at the extremum , the sharper the extremum is .",

    "+ let us note , that the equation  ( [ eq - approx ] ) has a simple solution regular for @xmath71 .",
    "it reads @xmath72 the equation  ( [ eq - approx ] ) is not analytically solvable in general .",
    "a great deal of information about the solutions may be inferred from the equation . to this end",
    "the substitution @xmath73 is very useful .",
    "the function @xmath74 has only nonnegative values .",
    "the equation  ( [ eq - approx ] ) turns into @xmath75 the above form of the equation makes its mechanical interpretation natural .",
    "the equation  ( [ weq ] ) is seen as a newton equation for a particle in a potential subject to a friction ( the term with the first derivative ) .",
    "assume @xmath76 .",
    "then , it is the sign of the coefficient @xmath77 that decides about the qualitative behavior of the solutions .",
    "if it is negative , the particle is trapped in a potential well .",
    "any solution eventually reaches the zero value then .",
    "this value is approached with a nonvanishing first derivative .",
    "hence , the solution of  ( [ eq - approx ] ) approaches zero as @xmath78 .",
    "this gives rise to the exploding first derivative of @xmath67 when @xmath79 .",
    "thus , there is no unambiguous way to continue the solution for @xmath80 .",
    "let us briefly interpret this finding in terms of the original equation  ( [ nto0 ] )",
    ". in a neighborhood of @xmath45 any solution of  ( [ nto0 ] ) coincides with the corresponding solution of  ( [ eq - approx ] ) .",
    "thus , any solution coming close enough to @xmath45 has a dead - end since it eventually reaches the value @xmath45 with infinite first derivative .",
    "+ now we discuss the case of positive @xmath77 in equation  ( [ weq ] ) .",
    "then , the potential has a global maximum for @xmath81 .",
    "a fictitious particle can climb the potential maximum if it is given enough ( mechanical ) energy .",
    "this gives rise to the exploding first derivative of @xmath67 as described above .",
    "however , this is not the only possible scenario .",
    "the particle may not have enough energy to reach the potential maximum .",
    "then , it climbs for some time ( @xmath28 is seen in this context as time ) , reaches its maximal accessible potential energy and finally dips .",
    "of course , up to the initial data , the particle may just decrease its potential energy without approaching the maximum .",
    "a corresponding solution reads asymptotically @xmath82 , hence @xmath83 .",
    "+ there is also a solution separating the two just described families of solutions .",
    "it is a solution grazing the value @xmath81 at a point @xmath84 .",
    "the function @xmath74 behaves then like @xmath85 , what gives @xmath86 .",
    "precisely , the equation  ( [ eq - approx ] ) is ambiguous for @xmath48 and the behavior @xmath87 is also correct .",
    "+ let us turn to the equation  ( [ nto0 ] ) .",
    "again , we concentrate on a strip around @xmath45 , where the equation  ( [ nto0 ] ) turns effectively into  ( [ eq - approx ] ) . consider solutions entering this strip ( thus the value of @xmath29 is set ) at a given point .",
    "the further evolution depends on the derivative of @xmath29 .",
    "if it is small , the function has an extremum and leaves the strip .",
    "the bigger absolute value of the derivative , the closer to @xmath45 the function @xmath29 approaches . for a critical value of the derivative",
    "the grazing solution appears . for larger values ,",
    "the solutions touch @xmath45 with infinite first derivative .",
    "figure  [ ilustr ] illustrates the above discussion graphically .",
    "+ in light of the above analysis the appearance of peakons is just a question of amplitude .",
    "if a q - ball profile function comes close to a root of the relation  ( [ gam0 ] ) , then a peaklike solution is expected ( if @xmath88 ) .",
    "let us stress once more that the above described structure does not emerge due to the v - shaped potential .",
    "it is inherent in the q - ball ansatz in the baby skyrme model .",
    "it would be interesting to see peakons in a broader perspective : what is their role in the whole model and what kind of nonlinearity makes them possible .",
    "+ the peakons have been reported in the case of the spinning q - balls , see  @xcite . in this case",
    "the equation for the profile function is a bit more complicated .",
    "we have decided to work out the problem with @xmath37 as it seems both generic and technically simple .",
    "what is more , some peakonlike nonspinning q - balls are also present in the model .",
    "we shall see this in the fifth section . in the next section",
    "some technical aspects peculiar to v - shaped potentials are described .",
    "+ finally , one more remark is in order .",
    "an analysis of equation  ( [ nto0 ] ) for large values of the function @xmath29 shows , that solutions explode to infinity for finite @xmath28 .",
    "we are not about to delve into this here , though .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have considered in detail how the additional terms modifying the laplace operator present in the baby skyrme model influence the equation for the q - ball profile function .",
    "these terms are responsible for appearance of peakons in the investigated theory . as we have mentioned above",
    ", it would be interesting to study the impact of this modification in a broader perspective .",
    "+ next we have demonstrated the failure of the power expansion in terms of a small parameter in the theory with nonsmooth field force .",
    "the parameter dependence of the matching point may be blamed for this . another way to characterize",
    "the parameter dependence has been devised . in this schema",
    "the q - ball solutions appear as relevant perturbations of a constant solution of the equation for the profile function .",
    "such a simplification of a fairly complicated equation bears not only qualitative understanding of the domain of existence of q - balls , but also a good quantitative description of the solutions in some range of parameters .",
    "+ the work may be continued in many directions .",
    "most obvious is a detailed investigation of the spinning q - balls and gaining some qualitative ( and quantitative if possible ) understanding of these solutions .",
