    "quantum gravity is probably the most challenging and fascinating problem of physics in the 21st century .",
    "the most impressive indicator is the number of people working on it , even though so far there is no experimental evidence that might guide us from mathematics to physical reality . during the last years",
    ", the priority in the field has undergone a shift towards the phenomenology and possible predictions @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of quantum gravity has been condensed into effective models which incorporate one of the most important and general features : a minimal invariant length scale that acts as a regulator in the ultraviolet .",
    "such a minimal length scale leads to a generalized uncertainty relation and it requires a deformation of lorentz - invariance which becomes important at high boost parameters .    the construction of a quantum field theory that self - consistently allows such a minimal length makes it necessary to carefully retrace all steps of the standard quantization scheme .",
    "so far , there are various approaches how to construct a quantum field theory that incorporates a minimal length scale and the accompanying deformed special relativity ( dsr ) , generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) and modified dispersion relation ( mdr ) .",
    "most notably , there are approaches which start from the dsr @xcite , the @xmath0-poincar hopf algebra @xcite and those which start with the gup @xcite",
    ". besides this , there exists the possibility to examine specific effects like reaction thresholds or radiation spectra starting from the mdr without aiming to derive a full quantum theory in the first place @xcite .",
    "relations between several approaches have been investigated in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we aim to closely examine the ansatz starting with the gup by paying special attention to the interpretation of the effective theory .",
    "since this starting point is conceptually different from the dsr - motivated one , it does not suffer from some of the problems that have been encountered within the latter , e.g. the conservation of momentum in particle interactions and the meaning of a highest energy scale for bound multi - particle states , the so - called soccer - ball - problem. as we will show , it is the treatment of a single non - interacting particle which distinguishes both approaches .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will investigate a picture of particle scattering with additional strong gravitational interaction and motivate an effective model to extend the quantum field theories of the standard model . in section three ,",
    "some properties of the model are investigated . in section four",
    "it is examined in which cases the model can be applied with special emphasis on the observer independence . in section five",
    "we analyze the relation to models starting with a deformation of lorentz transformations at high energies .",
    "we conclude in section six .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the convention @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "small greek indices are spacetime indices ; small latin indices label particle states .",
    "a particle with energy close to the planck mass , @xmath3 , is expected to significantly disturb space - time on a distance scale comparable to its own compton wavelength and thereby make effects of quantum gravity become important .",
    "a meaningful way to quantify how non - classical gravitational effects are is to examine the ability to describe spacetime as locally flat .",
    "the appropriate quantities are the entries of the curvature tensor in a locally orthonormal basis , or , in case it is non - vanishing , the curvature - scalar @xmath4 .",
    "quantum effects should become strong , when @xmath5 .",
    "however , provided that the rest mass of the particle itself is much smaller than the planck mass , boosting the particle to high rapidity will not change the curvature , or the strength of quantum gravitational effects , it causes .    instead , to make the above statement precise ,",
    "on has to refine its formulation : a concentration of energy high enough to cause strong curvature will result in significant quantum effects of gravity .",
    "such a concentration of energy might most intuitively be seen as an interaction process . in an interaction process",
    ", the relevant energy is that in the center of mass ( com ) system , which we will denote with @xmath6 .",
    "note that this is a meaningful concept only for a theory with more than one particle .",
    "however , it can also be used for a particle propagating in a background field consisting of many particles ( like e.g. the cmb ) .",
    "the scale at which effects of quantum gravity become important is when @xmath7 , for small impact parameters @xmath8 .",
    "let us consider the propagation of a particle with wave - vector @xmath9 , when it comes into a spacetime region in which its presence will lead to a com energy close to the planck scale .",
    "the concrete picture we want to draw is that of in- and outgoing point particles separated far enough and without noticeable gravitational interaction , that undergo a strong interaction in an intermediate region which we want to describe in an effective way .",
    "we denote the asymptotically free in(out)-going states with @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , primes are used for the momenta of the outgoing particles .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in the central collision region ,",
    "the curvature of spacetime is non - negligible and the scattering process as described in the quantum field theories ( qfts ) of the standard model ( sm ) is accompanied by gravitational interaction .",
    "we aim to find an effective description of this gravitational interaction , which we expect to modify the propagator , not of the asymptotically free states , but of the particles that transmit the interaction .",
    "the exchange particle has to propagate through a region with strong curvature , and the particle s propagation will dominantly be modified by the energy the particle carries .    even on a classical level",
    ", the backreaction of a field propagating in space - time is involved . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a massless scalar field @xmath12 . in principle",
    ", the evolution of space - time is described by einstein s field equations r _ - g _",
    "r = 8 g t_^ , [ efg ] where @xmath2 , and the source term is given by t_^= _",

    "+ g^ ^ _ _ = 0 . in the limit when the backreaction is small",
    ", the dependence of the metric on the field can be neglected . in this case , one has @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to the formulation of a field theory in a possibly curved background . when spacetime is asymptotically flat , such that @xmath14 , the equation of motion reduces to the familiar wave - equation which is solved by a superposition of modes of the form v_p ~ ( i ^ p_x _ ) , where @xmath15 fulfils the dispersion relation ^ p_p_= 0",
    "however , in general the metric @xmath16 will not only be a function of the space - time coordinates @xmath17 , but also a function of the derivatives @xmath18 , as dictated by eqs.([efg ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the christoffelsymbols . the general structure of eq .",
    "( [ waveeq ] ) is then g^(x , _ ) _ _ + h^(x , _ ) _",
    "[ fullwave ] it is therefore natural to expect that in regimes where the gravitational interaction becomes important , the metric which the field propagates in will be a function of its energy ( density ) .",
    "it is most likely not possible to describe strong gravitational effects by using classical general relativity , and the above motivation is not suitable to derive further details of the spacetime structure . instead",
    ", inherently new effects due to the quantum nature of spacetime will influence and eventually dominate the interaction processes .",
    "such behavior has previously been investigated in various context using approaches from space - time foams , loop gravity or d - brane recoil @xcite .",
    "these investigations indicate that quantum effects result in a modified dispersion relation for the propagating particles , which can also be formulated in terms of an energy dependent metric @xcite .",
    "the aim of the here discussed approach is to examine the additional gravitational interaction by means of an effective model .",
    "the qfts considered are modified in such a way that they capture one of the features that is generally expected to occur in quantum gravity @xcite : a minimal length scale . for this purpose , it is assumed that the exchange particles which mediate the sm interactions have to propagate through a region with a non - negligible quantum gravitational effects .    as motivated above and in @xcite",
    "the assumption is that the quantum gravitational effects can be captured by the following description    * in a region of strong gravitational effects , the metric is dominated by the energy - dependence and one has @xmath19 in @xmath20 $ ] .",

    "[ pt2 ]    in a complete description , one would also expect the metric to be a function of coordinates : this behavior is simulated in the usual way by switching the interaction on and off in the central region , which allows us to remain in the momentum space description . in this case , the metric in the interaction region is not a function of the coordinates . since the christoffelsymbols are partial derivatives of the metric",
    ", covariant derivatives reduce to partial derivatives and the wave - equation takes the form g^ ( _ ) _ _ = 0 , [ waveint ] which is solved by a superposition of modes of the form u_k = ( i ( k_x^ ) ) , [ mode ] where @xmath23 fulfils the dispersion relation g^(i k _ ) k_k_= 0 .

    "to preserve parity , @xmath26 should be an even function of @xmath27 , which also assures that no i s appear in the dispersion relation .",
    "we will in the following refer to the dispersion relation as being a modified dispersion relation ( mdr ) if ^ k_k_0 .",
    "note , that this need not necessarily be the case for all equations of the form ( [ mdr ] ) .",
    "e.g. when the energy dependent metric is of the form @xmath28 with some scaling function @xmath29 , then the dispersion relation ( [ mdr ] ) implies the standard dispersion relation .",
    "instead of dealing with an energy dependent metric as in eq .",
    "( [ mdr ] ) the essence of the ansatz can also be captured by starting with the non - trivial relation between the globally conserved and the local quantities @xmath30 .",
    "this description has been widely used in the dsr literature , and in the following possible interpretations of this approach are examined .",
    "the functional form of the unknown relation @xmath31 is where knowledge from an underlying theory has to enter .",
    "so far , the precise form of the function can not be derived .",
    "however , the above mentioned general expectations allow us to constrain the form of the function .",
    "such is that the planck length acts as a minimal length @xmath32 in the sense that structures can not be resolved to smaller distances .",
    "note again , that this statement is reasonable only for interaction processes since otherwise resolution is not a meaningful concept .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to construct a theory building up on single particles when one carefully keeps track of its meaning . e.g.",
    "the modified equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) effectively describes the gravitational interaction that the particle would undergo when it comes close to a high com energy .",
    "the single particle meaning therefore is a description of what property a single particle would need to have in order to simulate the behavior of quantum gravitational effects in the interactions . to make this really clear : the right way to describe the strong gravitational effects would be to include the appropriate quantized gravitational interaction , which is desirable but so far an unsolved problem .",
    "instead , we equip the point particle with an additional property ( @xmath23 no longer linear to @xmath15 ) that in interactions _ simulates effects that we expect from quantum gravity . _    according to the above , this relation between momentum @xmath15 and wave - vector @xmath23 to be such that no matter how high the energy of the particle gets , its wavelength can never become smaller than the minimal length . as a translation of 1a and 1b",
    ", the function @xmath30 therefore has to fulfill the requirements :    * for energies much smaller than @xmath22 the usual linear relation is found . * for large energies",
    ", @xmath23 asymptotically reaches @xmath22 .    and",
    "for a well defined relation we require    * the function is invertible , i.e. it is monotonically increasing .",
    "theories of this type have been examined in various context as to their analytical structure and phenomenological consequences @xcite .",
    "the lorentz - transformations acting on the wave - vector in the collision region have to respect the above three points .",
    "this means that for the quantity @xmath23 a deformed transformation is required which has an invariant minimal length @xmath33 or an invariant maximal energy scale @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we write the relation between momentum and wave - vector in the form @xmath34 , which can be expanded in a power series f^(k ) = ^ ( k_+ _ l=1^ k__1k__2 ... k__2l+1 ) where it is taken into account that @xmath15 is odd in @xmath23 .",

    "the wave - vectors @xmath23 coincide with the momenta of the in- or outgoing particles far away from the interaction region , where space - time is approximately flat @xmath37 .",

    "in contrast to the asymptotic momenta @xmath15 , the wave - vector @xmath23 of the particle in the interaction region will behave non - trivially because strong gravitational effects disturb the propagation of the wave .",

    ", the local quantity @xmath23 will be translated into a partial derivate .",
    "one now wants to proceed from the single-@xmath23 mode ( [ mode ] ) to a field and to the operator @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding momentum - operator @xmath45 should have the property p^v_k = p^v_k = f^(k ) v_k , which is fulfilled by p^= f^(- i ) , since every derivation results in just another @xmath23 .",

    "it is convenient to use the higher order operator @xmath47 in the setup of a field theory , instead if having to deal with an explicit infinite sum .",

    "such an asymptotic behavior could never be achieved with a finite power - series .    the higher order operator @xmath47 fulfills the property ( see appendix b ) _ ( ^ ) = - ( ^ _ ) + [ tbp ] this relation is essential for the usefulness of the operator as it allows to shift derivatives in the derivation of the equations of motion from a variational principle . in particular",
    ", the action for a scalar field takes the form s & = & ^4 x , with & = & ^   _ . using eq.([tbp ] )",

    "( [ eom ] ) for the conservation law .",
    "this becomes clear when one inserts a plane wave . since is was assumed that the dispersion relation is truly modified , it is @xmath52 .",
    "instead , the relation needed for the stress - energy conservation is @xmath53 . on the other hand , the quantity @xmath54 is conserved with respect to @xmath55 , but it will involve the energy - dependent metric from raising the indices in eq.([set ] ) .",
    "the calculus with the higher order operator @xmath47 effectively summarizes the explicit dealing with the infinite series , as examined in @xcite .",
    "normalized solutions to the wave - equation eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) can be found in the set of modes v_p(x ) = ( i k_x^ ) [ pmode ] , where @xmath56 . these modes",
    "solve the equation of motion when @xmath15 fulfills the usual dispersion relation , or @xmath23 fulfills the mdr , respectively .",
    "therefore , the interpretation of @xmath23 in a geometrical meaning as a wave - vector is justified .",
    "when imposing boundary conditions , one sees that the relevant quantity is @xmath23 and not @xmath15 which makes it clear that modifications will arise whenever one attempts to confine the particle in a region of size comparable to the planck length .",
    "this , e.g. has consequences for the casimir effect @xcite and for the evaporation of planck - size black holes @xcite .",
    "according to the above discussion of the interaction region , we can now examine the properties of the @xmath57-matrix .",
    "the quantity we measure for ingoing and outgoing states of a collision is typically not the wave - length of the particle but its ability to react with other particles . for scattering processes ,",
    "the quantity @xmath23 therefore is a mere dummy - variable that justifies its existence as a useful interpretational device in intermediate steps , where it enters through the propagator defined in eq .",

    "it is in principle possible to calculate in @xmath23-space , however , eventually @xmath23 can be completely replaced by the physical momentum @xmath15 .",
    "it is important to note that from the construction of the model , @xmath23-space has finite boundaries , whereas the momentum - space is infinite with a squeezed measure at high energies that regulates the usually divergent integration ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath57-matrix is invariant under the standard lorentz - transformation and conserves the sum of in- and outgoing momenta . to see this , note that the unitary operator of the poincar group that belongs to a lorentz boost @xmath58 and a translation @xmath59 acts on in- and outgoing states in momentum space in the usual way u(,a ) ^(p ) = ( -a^(p ) _ ) ^(p )",

    "the notion of a minimal length scale should be observer independent . at first sight",
    ", this seems to be in conflict with the standard lorentz - transformation since a boost would be able to contract a minimal length further .",
    "however , one has carefully to ask the right question . consider two observers related by a standard boost , each having a ruler of minimal length in his rest frame .",
    "this is no contradiction as long as both do not compare any quantity .",
    "the observer in the one system can not actually see the length of the object in the other system without probing it , which already involves an interaction process .    instead",
    ", one would ask both observers to perform the same experiment and measure which results arise from initial conditions they have both agreed on . such might e.g. be the ability to resolve smaller distances with larger energy , the impossibility of which indicates the closeness of planck - scale fuzziness and should be equally impossible for all observers .",
    "observer independence states that the outcome of such experiments has to be the same in all rest frames .",
    "this reasonable expectation makes immediately clear what consequences a model like the here discussed can have and can not have .",
    "consider a reaction made by one observer which results in a cross - section @xmath61 ( lorentz scalar ) as a function of varying com energy @xmath6 ( lorentz scalar ) .",
    "increasing @xmath6 , at com energy close to the planck scale , the reaction will stop probing smaller distances and the amplitude of the process will become ( asymptotically ) constant . in case",
    "the sm prediction was an increasing function , the modified amplitude will be lowered in comparison , in case the sm prediction was a decreasing function , the modified amplitude will be raised in comparison .",
    "one might say in general , the amplitude stagnates . since the cross - section @xmath62 takes into account the phase space of the outgoing particles , it is exponentially suppressed at energies above the planck scale @xcite",
    ". one can expect collider signatures to be dominantly visible in the @xmath63-channel at large momentum transfer @xmath64 .",
    "however , if such a cross - section has a typical com energy @xmath65 at which it has a sudden increase ( crossing of reaction threshold ) , this threshold ",
    "being a lorentz scalar  is the same for both observers . in particular , a reaction threshold that has been observed in a laboratory on earth to occur at a certain com energy , will in every inertial frame take place at the same com energy unless observer independence is explicitly violated .    within the here discussed model ,",
    "one expects a deviation of the cross - section relative to the sm result , when the com energy for the reaction gets close to the planck scale ( or a new lowered fundamental scale ) .",
    "this however , is certainly not the case e.g. for the recently examined photopion production with a threshold of @xmath66 gev that has been examined in earth s laboratories for decades .",
    "a modification of the threshold for photopion production , which has been proposed to explain the non - observation of the gzk - cutoff @xcite , therefore is only possible when observer independence is violated .",
    "indeed , one could use exactly this threshold to distinguish observers . in the here presented approach ,",
    "the threshold occurs at the same com energy in all reference frames , and thus the gzk - cutoff remains unmodified .",
    "this is due to the invariance of the cross - section under a boost from the com frame of the earth experiment to that of the cosmic ray interaction for the same @xmath6 ( see also appendix ) .    nevertheless , it is possible to find modifications from phenomenological quantum gravity in processes where there is a natural candidate for a special reference frame .",
    "e.g. a long - distance propagation of particles through the cmb might reflect in a modified dispersion relation .",
    "in such a case , the particle constantly propagates through an interaction region and therefore the mdr applies . even though the modification of the particle s propagation are tiny , they can add up over a long travel distance .",
    "an observable that has recently been investigated in this context as to its possibility to reveal such quantum gravitational effects is the time of flight or hbt @xcite for @xmath67-rays from far away sources . in case",
    "the mdr predicts a varying speed of light , the time of flight can depend on the energy of the photon which could become detectable with glast @xcite .",
    "also , the meaning of quantum mechanics within the above introduced framework becomes accessible using this interpretation . from a non - linear relation @xmath68 ,",
    "it follows that the uncertainty principle is generalized to @xmath69&= & + i \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial k } \\quad \\rightarrow\\quad   \\delta p \\delta x \\geq \\frac{1}{2 }   \\bigg| \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial k }   \\right\\rangle \\bigg| \\quad . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in quantum mechanics , the interaction is not quantized but we describe a particle in a potential or with boundary conditions respectively .",
    "here , the potential plays the role of a background field and sets the scale for the effects to become important .",
    "in such a scenario , the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and the spectrum of the harmonic oscillator have been investigated @xcite , and also the gyromagnetic moment ( precision in a strong magnetic background field ) of the muon @xcite receives corrections already at the quantum mechanical level .    based on this , it is now possible to understand multi - particle bound states .",
    "such a bound state of several particles with small rest masses can eventually have a total mass higher than the planck mass .",
    "assuming that the gravitational interaction of the bound particles is weak , quantum gravitational effects are negligible and the system can be described within the standard qft .",
    "most importantly , it will be boosted according to the standard lorentz - transformation like the free single particle ( free from gravitational as well as sm interactions ) .",
    "there is no region of gravitationally strong interacting particles that would require modifications .",
    "one might however probe such a bound system by using a high energetic beam in a rutherford - like experiment .",
    "one would then again find a limit to the resolution of the internal structure of the bound system .",
    "from the above discussion it is now apparent that there are two conceptually different ways to include a minimal length scale into the qfts of the sm and to obtain an effective model .",
    "the model discussed here leaves the transformation of the free single particle unmodified since for such a particle there is no natural scale which could be responsible for quantum gravitational effects to become important .    starting from an effective description in terms of a modified dispersion relation in the interaction region , we have shown in",
    "how far this model is a reasonable candidate to describe strong gravitational effects in interactions .",
    "it has a clear interpretation for energy and momentum of the participating particles , and it does not suffer from the soccer - ball problem . as has been shown previously , the model has an ultraviolet regulator and modified feynman rules can be derived @xcite .",
    "this becomes possible by carefully asking what observables we investigate .",
    "interestingly , it has also been previously mentioned that the arising problems in dsr might be resolved by reconsidering the measurement process @xcite .",
    "it is however also possible to start with a modification of the lorentz - transformation for a free single particle and construct a qft based on this . for this",
    ", one assumes that the free particle itself experiences the planck mass as an upper bound on the energy scale .",
    "such a dsr is a non - linear representation of the lorentz - group @xcite , which can be cast in a form similar to the above used by introducing variables that transform under the usual representation of the lorentz - group , @xmath70 , and a general map @xmath71 to the variables that then obey the new deformed transformation law @xmath72 .",
    "however , due to the different interpretation of the free particle s quantities , the pseudo - variable @xmath73 is not the one identified with the physical four momentum .",
    "instead , energy and momentum of the in- and outgoing particles are identified with those that have the deformed transformation behavior .",
    "as it has turned out over the last years , such attempts result in serious conceptual problems , the most important being the question of which quantities are conserved in interactions and the soccer - ball problem .",
    "recently , important progress has been made as to how these models can be put on a solid base @xcite though the situation is not yet completely satisfactory and open questions remain @xcite .    from the present day status ,",
    "it is not possible to decide which is the right description of nature .",
    "one might however lean on results from promising theories of quantum gravity and examine e.g. the question in how far loop gravity @xcite or string theory have a minimal length .",
    "though the appearance of a finite resolution in string - scattering has been examined @xcite , it remains to investigate in how far this is compatible with the dsr - description of the point - particle limit of interaction processes , or whether a dsr can be accommodated in string theory @xcite .",
    "one should also keep in mind that these two mentioned approaches with a dsr might not be the only possibilities to include a minimal length into qft .",
    "another option might be to start with a modification of the interaction at smallest distances itself , and it is not a priori clear whether this can always be described in terms of the here discussed model or whether a more general approach is necessary .",
    "we have investigated an effective description of particle interactions in the presence of strong gravitational effects . as a phenomenological description of quantum gravity , we have motivated the use of a modified dispersion relation , and we have interpreted the arising picture of the interaction process .",
    "further , we have argued that a fundamental minimal resolution is an observer independent statement even though a free particle might still transform under standard lorentz - transformations .",
    "we have shown that in this case , the model has a clear interpretation for the conserved quantities and for the behavior of multi - particle states .",
    "based on this , we distinguished two conceptually different approaches towards a quantum field theory with a minimal length , depending on the treatment of the non - interacting single particle .",

[ threshold ] a map like the above introduced @xmath29 or @xmath71 from quantities that transfrom under the usual lorentz - tranformation to those that obey the deformed transformation law , leaves a lorentz - scalar a lorentz - scalar ( though these can differ by a factor which then necessarily is a constant , see also @xcite ) .",
    "applying such a map to eq.([threshold ] ) will therefore leave the inequality valid for all inertial systems .",
    "however , within the dsr - approach , the non - linear transformation law for the physical momenta spoils the lorentz - invariance of this equation . assuming that the single particle momenta transform according to the new transformation",
    ", the additive quantity @xmath79 does not remain a lorentz - scalar , which should be really carefully investigated as to whether it actually still allows observer independence .",
    "let us start with examining an @xmath80th - order differential operator @xmath81 of the form ^(n ) & = & b^_1 b^_2 ... b^_n _ _ 1 _ _ 2 ... _ _ n [ d ] then one finds for some functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( d^(n ) h ) g & = & b^_1 b^_2 ... b^_n ( _ _ 1 _ _ 2 ... _ _ n h ) g + & = & _ _ 1 ( b^_1 b^_2 ... b^_n ( _ _ 2 ... _ _ n h ) g ) + & - & ( b^_2 ... b^_n _ _ 2 ... _ _ n h ) ( b^_1 _ _ 1 g ) + & = & - ( b^_2 ... b^_n _ _ 2 ... _ _ n h ) ( b^_1 _ _ 1 g )  , where t.d. means total divergence and is of the form @xmath84 .",
    "repeat this step @xmath85 times to obtain ( d^(n ) h ) g & = & ( -1)^n h ( d^(n ) g ) + .",
    "[ 1 ] the operator @xmath86 is of the form ^= ^ ( _ + _ l=1^ ^(2l+1 ) ) , where the higher order contributions start with order @xmath87 in agreement with the above observation that the series has only odd contributions .",
    "it is understood that the dimensionless coefficients @xmath88 in eq.([d ] ) of the @xmath89-operators can depend on @xmath90 and can be translated in the @xmath59 coefficients of eq.([delta ] ) . inserting into eq.([tbp ] )",
    "( ^ ) = ^ _ ( _ ) + ^ _ l=1^ _ ( d^(2l+1 ) )  .",
    "the first part is the usual part , the second part can be rewritten with eq.([1 ] ) to _ ( ^ ) = & - & ^ ( _ _ ) + & - & _ l=1^ ( d^(2l+1 ) _ ) + and rearranging finally results in eq.([tbp ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this does only work when only even powers of the operators @xmath81 appear .",
