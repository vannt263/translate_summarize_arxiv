    "magnetic fields in massive stars have fundamental effects on the stellar evolution and rotation , and on the structure , dynamics and heating of their radiatively - driven winds . to identify and to model the physical processes responsible for the generation of their magnetic fields , it is important to establish whether magnetic fields can also be detected in massive stars that are fast rotators and have runaway status .",
    "recent detections of strong magnetic fields in very fast rotating early - b type stars indicate that the spindown timescale via magnetic braking can be much longer than the estimated age of these targets ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , current studies of their kinematical status identified a number of magnetic o and of?p stars as candidate runaway stars ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "increasing the known number of magnetic objects with extreme rotation , which are probably products of a past binary interaction , is important to understand the magnetic field origin in massive stars .",
    "a few years ago , we presented the first spectropolarimetric observations of @xmath0oph @xcite , obtained with fors1 ( focal reducer low dispersion spectrograph ; @xcite ) mounted on the 8-m kueyen telescope of the very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "the star @xmath0ophiuchi ( = hd149757 ) of spectral type o9.5v is a well - known rapidly rotating runaway star , rotating almost at break - up velocity with @xmath2kms@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "later , additional nine fors2 spectropolarimetric observations of @xmath0oph were obtained over four consecutive nights .",
    "the analysis of the fors2 observations showed the presence of a weak magnetic field with a reversal of polarity @xcite and an amplitude of about 100 g .",
    "the resulting periodogram for the magnetic field measurements using all available lines showed a dominating peak corresponding to a period of about 1.3d , which is roughly double the period of 0.643d determined by @xcite , who studied the variation of the equivalent width of the hei  6678 line .",
    "@xcite used espadons and narval observations of @xmath0oph in 2011/12 with much larger uncertainties  typically around 350 g and between 100 and 800 g  and concluded that the upper limit of the dipole field strength is about 224 g and the maximum possible rotation period 1.1d .",
    "high - resolution spectropolarimetric results are thus in contradiction with the fors2 observations .",
    "the o4ief supergiant @xmath0pup ( = hd66811 ) is the brightest o - type star in the sky with a magnitude @xmath4 .",
    "similar to @xmath0ophiuchi , it rotates rather fast with @xmath5kms@xmath3 @xcite , and is a runaway star , which may be a product of a past binary interaction , possibly having had an encounter with the cluster trumper10 some 2myr ago @xcite .",
    "the most recent periodicity analysis was presented by @xcite , who determined @xmath6d using optical photometry obtained with the smei ( solar mass ejection imager ) instrument on the coriolis satellite between 2003 and 2006 . on the other hand ,",
    "numerous studies in the past that used observations in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum , reported various periodic or cyclical signals , from a couple of hours to about 5days .",
    "an overview of these studies is presented in the work of @xcite .",
    "the authors report that no evidence for persistent coherent signals with semi - amplitudes in excess of about 2  mmag on any of the time - scales previously reported in the literature was detected in their data .",
    "in particular , there was no evidence for a signature of a rotation period of about 5d .",
    "noteworthy , the period of 1.78d was also recently unambiguously identified in observations of the brite ( bright - star target explorer ) satellites ( ramiaramanantsoa , priv .",
    "comm . ) .    the peculiar behaviour , in particular the appearance of a double - peaked heii @xmath74686 emission line in the spectra of @xmath0pup was already discussed over the last decades ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite reported the presence of complex linear polarization effects across the h@xmath8 line profiles of @xmath0pup and suggested that they can be attributed to the impact of the rapid rotation of the star on its winds .",
    "@xcite detected profile variability with a period of 5.075d in the depth of the nearly central absorption reversal of the pcygni type h@xmath8 profile in spectrophotometric observations of @xmath0pup and proposed that the winds of oef stars might be shaped by a dipolar stellar magnetic field .",
    "searches for the presence of a magnetic field in @xmath0pup were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite used caspec observations on four consecutive nights , covering time intervals between 30 and 76min .",
    "the measurements were based on four he lines placed well within the caspec orders and not sensitive to defects in the normalization procedure . although a change of field polarity was indicated on every second night , the measurement accuracies were low , between 200 and 360 g .",
    "@xcite obtained 30 individual measurements over 1.9h with espadons in a single night . from these observations , the authors estimated an upper limit on the dipolar field strength of 121 g . on the other hand , high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations are not especially appropriate for the detection of weak magnetic fields in broad - lined stars .",
    "some broad spectral lines like the heii  4686 line or the close - by blend of niii lines extend over adjacent orders , so that it is necessary to adopt the order shapes to get the best continuum normalization .",
    "no continuum normalization is required in fors2 spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "furthermore , it is of importance that @xcite and @xcite reported the presence of velocity - resolved structure in the photospheric absorption lines of @xmath0pup , with a possible 8.5-h periodicity .",
    "their observations showed characteristic blue - to - red migration of bumps and dips in the absorption - line profiles , suggesting non - radial pulsation as the underlying physical mechanism .",
    "@xcite also mentioned that every 0.178d a new component develops in the blue wings of the civ  5801 , 5812 lines and it takes twice the amount of time for the feature to traverse the entire profile .",
    "notably , @xcite report on the presence of variable substructures on a time scale of 10 - 20min , likely representing the stochastic manifestation of turbulent clumps propagating outward with the wind .",
    "these studies underline the possible impact of short - time variability on the magnetic field measurements , which can be quite significant in supergiants ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : same ] and e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "since the information on the presence of a magnetic field in @xmath0pup is rather limited , we decided to carry out spectropolarimetric observations randomly distributed over a few weeks using the vlt instrument fors2 in service mode . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of our fors2 spectropolarimetric monitoring of @xmath0pup and discuss the observed magnetic and spectral variability assuming the oblique rotator interpretation .",
    "thirteen spectropolarimetric observations of @xmath0pup were carried out from 2013 october 5 to 2013 december 23 in service mode at the european southern observatory using fors2 @xcite mounted on the 8-m antu telescope of the vlt .",
    "this multi - mode instrument is equipped with polarisation analysing optics comprising super - achromatic half - wave and quarter - wave phase retarder plates , and a wollaston prism with a beam divergence of 22@xmath9 in standard resolution mode .",
    "we used the grism 600b and the narrowest available slit width of 0@xmath104 to obtain a spectral resolving power of @xmath11 .",
    "the observed spectral range from 3250 to 6215 includes all balmer lines , apart from h@xmath8 , down to h14 , and numerous helium lines , up to 15 .",
    "for the observations , we used a non - standard readout mode with low gain ( 200khz,1@xmath121,low ) , which provides a broader dynamic range , hence allowed us to reach a higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the individual spectra .",
    "a first description of the assessment of the longitudinal magnetic field measurements using fors1/2 spectropolarimetric observations was presented in our previous work ( e.g.  @xcite , and references therein ) . to minimize the cross - talk effect , and to cancel errors from different transmission properties of the two polarised beams ,",

    "is usually executed during observations . moreover",
    ", the reversal of the quarter wave plate compensates for fixed errors in the relative wavelength calibrations of the two polarised spectra .",
    "according to the fors user manual , the @xmath16 spectrum is calculated using : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate the position angle of the retarder waveplate and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the ordinary and extraordinary beams , respectively .",

    "null profiles , @xmath22 , are calculated as pairwise differences from all available @xmath23 profiles . from these ,",
    "3@xmath1-outliers are identified and used to clip the @xmath23 profiles .",
    "this removes spurious signals , which mostly come from cosmic rays , and also reduces the noise .",
    "a full description of the updated data reduction and analysis will be presented in a separate paper ( schller et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "due to the brightness of the star , the exposure time for each subexposure accounted for 0.25s",
    ".    the mean longitudinal magnetic field , @xmath24 , is measured on the rectified and clipped spectra based on the relation @xmath25    where @xmath23 is the stokes parameter that measures the circular polarization , @xmath26 is the intensity in the unpolarized spectrum , @xmath27 is the effective land factor , @xmath28 is the electron charge , @xmath7 is the wavelength , @xmath29 is the electron mass , @xmath30 is the speed of light , @xmath31 is the wavelength derivative of stokes  @xmath26 , and @xmath32 is the mean longitudinal ( line - of - sight ) magnetic field ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field was measured in three ways : using the entire spectrum including all available lines , excluding lines in emission , and using exclusively hydrogen lines .",
    "the feasibility of longitudinal magnetic field measurements in massive stars using low - resolution spectropolarimetric observations was demonstrated by previous studies of o and b - type stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of discrepancies in the published measurement accuracies using fors1 data were reported by @xcite , who used the eso fors1 pipeline to reduce the fors1 archive .",
    "some of the reasons for higher error bars in the study of @xcite are discussed by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have carried out monte carlo bootstrapping tests .",
    "these are most often applied with the purpose of deriving robust estimates of standard errors .",
    "the measurement uncertainties obtained before and after monte carlo bootstrapping tests were found to be in close agreement , indicating the absence of reduction flaws . since @xcite and @xcite suggested the presence of non - radial pulsations in @xmath0pup , to check the stability of the spectral lines along the full sequence of sub - exposures , we have compared the profiles of several spectral lines recorded in the parallel beam with the retarder waveplate at @xmath18 .",
    "the same was done for spectral lines recorded in the perpendicular beam .",
    "the line profiles looked identical within the noise and no instability like that found in the a0 supergiant hd92207 @xcite was found in our fors2 observations .

    "[ fig : rot ] and  [ fig : rot1 ] is real , then the observed single - wave variation in the longitudinal magnetic field during the stellar rotation cycle would indicate a dominant dipolar contribution to the magnetic field topology .",
    "if the star is an oblique dipole rotator , the magnetic dipole axis tilt @xmath33 is constrained by    @xmath34    where the inclination angle @xmath35 can be derived from considerations of the stellar fundamental parameters @xcite . using for the stellar radius @xmath36 @xcite combined with the period of 1.78d",

    "the estimated dipole strengths of @xmath40 g and @xmath41 g are significantly higher than the dipole strength value suggested by @xcite , who determined an upper limit of 121 g from one single longitudinal magnetic field measurement .",
    "obviously , greater sensitivity in future magnetic field observations is necessary to further test the presence of a magnetic field in @xmath0pup .",
    "as was already reported in the literature , line profiles belonging to different elements in @xmath0pup show strong variability . as an example , we present in fig .  [",

    "the largest variability amplitude in the velocity frame and in the line profile depths is detected in hydrogen lines and in the heii  4686 line .",
    "the heii  4686 line shows the presence of two components , where the blue component becomes stronger in the vicinity of the positive magnetic extremum and slightly stronger again in the vicinity of the negative field extremum .",
    "similar to the results of @xcite , who used the civ  5801 , 5812 lines , the heii  4542 line exhibits a clear splitting at certain epochs , while the line heii  5411 displays a moderate splitting .",

    "clear variability is detected for all studied absorption lines .",
    "the equivalent widths of absorption hydrogen and helium lines decreases in the vicinity of the positive magnetic pole , while the intensity of the emission lines heii  4686 and the blend of niii lines at @xmath434640 behave opposite , showing an increase at the positive magnetic pole .",
    "however , as is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : per5 ] , no smooth variation of equivalent widths over a longer period ( we use in these plots the period of 5.26d suggested by @xcite ) is detected .",

    "interestingly , a smaller peak is found close to 0.192d@xmath3 , corresponding to a period of about 5.21d .",
    "further , our study of the temporal behaviour of different lines shows a shift in the line position at phases between 0.80 and 0.90 by about 60kms@xmath3 where the change from positive to negative polarity of the longitudinal magnetic field takes place .",
    "no such strong shift is detected at the phase when the field changes the polarity from negative to positive .",

    "admittedly , a major part of the magnetic massive stars rotate rather slow , but still a small group of early b - type stars with strong magnetic fields and extraordinary fast rotation exists , posing a mystery for theories of star formation and magnetic field evolution ( e.g.   @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of magnetic fields in massive stars is still under debate .",
    "it was suggested that the fields are either `` fossil '' remnants of the galactic ism field , which is amplified during the collapse of a magnetised gas cloud ( e.g.  @xcite ) , or that they are formed in a dramatic close binary interaction , i.e. , in a merger of two stars or a dynamical mass transfer event ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
