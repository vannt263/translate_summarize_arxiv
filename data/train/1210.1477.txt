    "with increasing center of mass energy at hadron colliders , multi - particle final states at high transverse momentum receive an increasingly important contribution from multi - parton interactions .",
    "the prototype of such processes are double parton interactions in which two partons from each hadron enter into collision at two distinct hard vertexes .",
    "the calculation of such double parton interactions involves double generalized parton distributions ( @xmath0gpds ) that - in principle - contain information about the spatial and momentum correlations of two partons in the incoming hadronic wave function . in practice ,",
    "experimental constraints on these correlations are scarce .",
    "since nuclear projectiles offer significantly different two - parton correlations , the question arises to what extent a combined analysis program of proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc could help to constrain @xmath0gpds . in this paper",
    ", we classify the different contributions to nuclear @xmath0gpds and how they contribute to the double parton scattering cross section into 4 jets that is experimentally accessible in the upcoming p - a run at the lhc .",

    "the transverse momentum parameter @xmath8 denotes the difference between the transverse momenta exchanged by one parton in the amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude and it is conjugate to the relative spatial transverse distance between the two partons . in general , @xmath0gpds contain a non - perturbative two - parton contribution in which qcd evolution amounts to an independent evolution of both partons with standard one - parton evolution equations ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition , there is a contribution in which both partons result perturbatively as the two daughters of a single parent parton in the qcd evolution ( @xmath10 ) . this second term couples the evolution of @xmath0gpds to the evolution of the standard one - parton distribution functions . for the production of two pairs of jets in independent back - to - back kinematics ,",

    "this suppression factor in ( [ eq31 ] ) is less important and it vanishes for @xmath177 .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the estimate ( [ eq31 ] ) does not account for all physics effects .",
    "in particular , it neglects effects from qcd evolution . in the remainder of this section , we present arguments for why the contribution of fig.[fig3 ] can be expected to be suppressed in the range @xmath176 , too .    as emphasized already in the introduction , the discussion in the present paper focusses on sufficiently hard processes for which a perturbative hierarchy of scales @xmath178 ensures that one can select experimentally the relevant back - to - back kinematics in which double - hard four jet production dominates . for the case of lhc",
    ", this implies that one realistically should consider jets with @xmath179 gev / c and hence typically @xmath180 for production at central rapidities . in general , the initial state qcd parton showers associated to such processes lead to radiation above some non - perturbative starting scale @xmath181 and up to the transverse momentum @xmath182 .",
    "( for the processes under consideration at the lhc , transverse momenta arising from this qcd evolution may be estimated to be of the order of @xmath141 gev or larger for each of the two hard processes . ) as a consequence of this qcd evolution , the momentum transferred to the two nucleons involved in fig.[fig3 ] are @xmath183 , and @xmath184 leading to a configuration with two nucleons with back to back momenta @xmath185 .",
    "these momentum differences are much larger than the typical momenta in the nucleon wave function : @xmath186 , but for a physical contribution , the transverse momenta of the nucleons must match between amplitude and complex conjugate amplitude in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this is only possible if the initial state radiations of partons in the two active nucleons are matched to an extent that @xmath185 is much smaller than what one expects from two independent qcd evolutions .",
    "this is a phase space constraint on the qcd evolution that is not included in the parton model estimate ( [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "since one requires @xmath187 , we expect this phase space constraint to provide a very strong suppression factor for the contribution fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in the previous paragraph , we have argued that effects of qcd evolution that are not taken into account in ( [ eq31 ] ) , lead to a strong suppression of fig .",
    "this suppression is expected to increase with increasing jet energy when effects of qcd evolution become more important , i.e. , this suppression is particularly relevant in the region of high transverse momentum on which our discussion focusses in this paper .",
    "we note that at sufficiently high jet energy , further suppression effects may arise .",
    "in particular , we observe that for @xmath188 , the coherence lengths @xmath189 become smaller than the average internucleon distance @xmath190 2 fm . if one expects that the exchange of partons between two nucleons is similar to the diagram of nn interaction which in t - channel has the closest singularity at @xmath191 reflecting the finite range of nn interactions , one must require that the active nucleons in the nucleus are close in configurational space : @xmath192 .",
    "one arrives at the same argument by noticing that since in this case the coherence lengths ( ioffe times or equivalently current correlators ) are small , interference is possible only if the longitudinal distance between nucleons is smaller than coherence length .",
    "hence the interference term for @xmath188 is not enhanced by a factor @xmath117 as the double nucleon scattering term . in summary ,",
    "very little is known so far about interference contributions of the form fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .  ) .",
    "the a - dependence for large @xmath11 , and the effects of qcd evolution suppressing interference discussed here were not addressed in @xcite .",
    "] in the present section , we have considered this contribution first on the level of the parton model , see discussion of eq .",
    "we have then given a qualitative argument for why a very strong additional suppression of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , not seen in the estimate ( [ eq31 ] ) , should arise if effects of qcd evolution are taken into account for sufficiently hard processes .",
    "and we have given a second , independent formation time argument for why the contribution fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is not enhanced by @xmath117 .",
    "both qualitative arguments indicate that fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is strongly suppressed compared to the other contributions to the double hard 4-jet cross section in proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "gpd in which the two partons are drawn from a single nucleon in the amplitude while the parton 2 is associated to a different nucleon in the complex conjugate amplitude .",
    "this process requires the exchange of additional constituents between both active nucleons , as indicated by the grey blob . ]",
    "we finally consider the process where the two partons active in the double hard scattering are drawn from the same nucleon ( with light - cone momentum fraction @xmath67 ) in the amplitude , but from two different nucleons ( with light cone momentum fractions @xmath193 ) in the complex conjugate amplitude , see fig.[inter ] .",
    "the momentum fraction of the spectator nucleon in the amplitude is denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "longitudinal momentum conservation implies constraints on such processes .",
    "in particular , @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "since the light cone momentum fractions @xmath84 deviate from unity only by fermi motion , this will constrain contributions of the diagram fig.[inter ] to relatively small momentum fractions @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , we expect that exchanges as depicted in fig.[inter ] can arise only between nucleons neighboring in impact parameter .",
    "we note as an aside that the diagram fig.[inter ] is related to the diagrams for the leading twist nuclear shadowing discussed in ref .",
    "but to become quantitative is difficult and lies outside the scope of the present work .",
    "we now turn to a more general discussion of the corrections to ( [ eq23 ] ) that may arise from the nuclear dependence of parton distribution functions .",
    "in our discussion so far , we have neglected nuclear modifications of the single parton distribution functions .",
    "standard parametrizations of these modifications are based on a linear relation between the parton distributions @xmath196 in a proton and the parton distributions @xmath197 per nucleon in a nucleus  @xcite @xmath198 in all parametrizations that are consistent with linear @xmath65-evolution  @xcite , the npdf factors @xmath199 at fixed @xmath66 approach unity with increasing @xmath65 .",
    "since the jet production considered here is a hard process with typically @xmath200 , we expect @xmath201 over the entire @xmath66 , and @xmath65-range relevant for four - jet production at the lhc .",
    "this assumption can be verified experimentally by checking that the nuclear modification factor for dijet production , @xmath202 deviates from unity by less than 3% in the kinematical range used to measure the four - jet cross sections .",
    "an o(3% ) uncertainty from `` npdf corrections '' to the dijet cross section entering the norm in ( [ eq23 ] ) is expected to result in an o(6% ) uncertainty on the nuclear modification factor for double hard four - jet production .",
    "the central question is whether a correction to ( [ eq23 ] ) of this order is small enough to be neglected in the analysis of the longitudinal two - parton correlation function @xmath203 .",
    "this depends on how the size of the deviation of @xmath203 from unity compares to the size of the npdf correction of ( [ eq23 ] ) , and we shall distinguish below two different cases .",
    "let us discuss , however , first how the nuclear modification of longitudinal parton momenta in the nucleus can be taken into account in the formulation of @xmath0gpds . to this end",
    ", one needs to specify correction factors for the three contributions to the nuclear @xmath0gpd listed on the right hand side of equation ( [ sum1 ] ) . in principle , this requires more information than what is contained in the npdf - fits based on ( [ eq6b ] ) . adopting the picture of the nucleus",
    "as an incoherent superposition of nucleons that have parton distributions shifted according to ( [ eq6b ] ) , one arrives at corrections of the simple form @xmath204 in principle , nuclear pdfs depend also on the impact parameter @xmath118 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for first parametrizations ) , and this @xmath118-dependence could be accommodated in ( [ eq36 ] ) and ( [ eq37 ] ) .",
    "this , however , will be a small correction on top of the correction discussed here , and we neglect it in the following .",
    "the third contribution @xmath43 to the nuclear @xmath0gpd does not have an npdf correction factor of this form .",
    "rather , since the arguments @xmath36 , @xmath37 in @xmath43 result dynamically from the splitting of a single parton , the npdf corrections will be determined by an integration over the available phase space that may be written formally as @xmath205 to determine npdf corrections to ( [ eq23 ] ) in the most general case , one would have to specify ( [ eq38 ] ) fully and then repeat the calculations in sections  [ sec2]-[sec4 ] based on equations ( [ eq36])-([eq38 ] ) . because of the more complicated form of ( [ eq38 ] ) , the explicit results for the npdf corrections to ( [ eq23 ] ) would be relatively involved . here , we restrict our discussion by considering two limiting cases :    first , we observe that if ( [ eq38 ] ) makes a numerically important contribution to the total nuclear @xmath0gpd ( [ sum1 ] ) , then longitudinal two - parton correlations in the nucleus are expected to be large .",
    "this is so , since ( [ eq38 ] ) is dynamically generated by a perturbative parton branching that inevitably results in significant longitudinal correlations .",
    "indeed , according to the model of @xcite one can expect a @xmath206 deviation of @xmath203 from unity if the double hard four jet cross section is dominated by @xmath35 processes .",
    "therefore , if the term ( [ eq38 ] ) is relevant , we expect that @xmath207 and that the npdf - corrections to ( [ eq23 ] ) are small . in this case",
    ", @xmath208 is much larger than the expected npdf corrections and it can thus be extracted safely from ( [ eq28 ] ) without taking npdf corrections into account .",
    "we emphasize that the validity of this procedure can be checked experimentally by measuring the nuclear modification factor for dijet production in pa .    alternatively ,",
    "if an experimental determination of @xmath208 from ( [ eq28 ] ) yields values @xmath209 , the contribution of the @xmath27 splitting term ( [ eq38 ] ) to the nuclear @xmath0gpd can be expected to be small , and one can justify hence the use of a simplified npdf correction of the form @xmath210 . in this case , the npdf corrections to the contributions ( [ singleq ] ) , ( [ doubleq ] ) and ( [ eq18 ] ) amount to multiplying all three expressions with two powers of the nuclear modification factor for dijets , @xmath211 . as a consequence ,",
    "the right hand side of ( [ eq23 ] ) gets multiplied by two powers of @xmath211 , and the npdf correction to ( [ eq28 ] ) takes the form @xmath212 experimentally , comparing the values obtained from ( [ eq28 ] ) and ( [ eq39 ] ) provides a direct way of estimating the importance of npdf corrections on the interpretation of @xmath156 as a normalized longitudinal two - parton correlation function .",
    "in summary , by analyzing @xmath0gpds for the nucleus in the many nucleon approximation , we have derived a compact expression ( [ eq23 ] ) for the nuclear modification factor of the double - hard four jet cross section in pa collisions . based on this main result",
    ", we have outlined an experimental strategy for determining the normalized longitudinal two - parton correlation function @xmath203 in the proton by combining data from pp and pa collisions .",
    "we also argued that interference contribution due to exchange of two partons between nucleons are strongly suppressed in the lhc kinematics .",
    "finally , we have discussed how nuclear modifications of parton distribution functions can be taken into account in this analysis .",
    "overall our treatment allows to consider the bulk of the lhc kinematics when at least one of the nuclear partons has @xmath213 .",
    "the kinematics where both nuclear partons are in the shadowing region will be considered elsewhere . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite and as recalled here , one possible dynamical source of longitudinal 2-parton correlations @xmath214 in the proton is collinear parton splitting that leads to a sizable @xmath35 contribution in 4-jet events . the comparison of data from pp and pa collisions , advocated here , should be regarded as one of several experimentally feasible avenues to test for such a contribution .",
    "another possibility to discriminate between @xmath35 and @xmath109 contributions may be given by exploiting their different dependence on @xmath215 .",
    "given the complexity of the problem of characterizing 2gpds , we believe that all possible approaches should be explored . the main purpose of this paper is to discuss how data from pa collisions can contribute to such a program .    in early 2013 ,",
    "the lhc is scheduled for a 4-week - long proton - nucleus run .",
    "the main motivation for this pa program at the lhc is to constrain the parton distributions in the nucleus and to provide important benchmark measurements for the lhc heavy ion programme .",
    "as illustrated by the calculation of @xmath214 in this paper , however , proton - nucleus collisions may also contribute to further constrain the multi - parton structure of the proton , thus probing the proton in nuclear collisions rather than probing the nucleus in collisions with protons .",
