    "the discoveries of the faint dusty ring systems of the giant planets beginning in the late 1970s greatly changed our understanding of planetary rings .",
    "unlike saturn s classical rings , which are most likely ancient @xcite , dusty rings are young and are continually replenished from source satellites .",
    "individual ring particles have short lifetimes against drag forces and other loss mechanisms , and because dusty rings are so diffuse , they are essentially collisionless . furthermore , dusty rings are affected by a host of non - gravitational forces including solar radiation pressure and electromagnetism , which can sculpt them in interesting ways .",
    "since the giant planets are far from the sun and dusty rings are normally near their primary , radiation pressure is usually a weak perturbation to the planet s gravity .",
    "the electromagnetic force arising from the motion of charged dust grains relative to the planetary magnetic field , however , can be quite strong .",
    "in particular , with nominal electric charges , dust grains smaller than a fraction of a micron in radius are more strongly affected by electromagnetism than gravity .",
    "dust in space acquires electric charges in several ways . moving through the plasma environment produces a negative charge on a grain , since the plasma electrons are much lighter and swifter than ions and",
    "hence are captured more frequently by orbiting dust grains @xcite . on the other hand , sunlight ejects photo - electrons from the surface of a grain , and can cause positive charges @xcite .",
    "electron or ion impacts will also produce secondary electron emission , which also favors a net positive equilibrium charge on the grain @xcite .",
    "these currents interact in complicated ways ; the charging of a dust grain depends on the physical properties of the grain itself and also on its charge history @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide an excellent review of these processes .",
    "many authors have investigated detailed aspects of the motion of charged grains in planetary magnetic fields , but no study has yet determined the orbital stability of grains for all charge - to - mass ratios launched at all distances in a systematic way . in this paper",
    "we explore the local and global stability of both positive and negative dust grains launched from ring particle parent bodies which themselves orbit at the local kepler speed .      as grains with radii greater than several microns",
    "have small charge - to - mass ratios , electromagnetic effects are weak , and the grains orbit the planet along nearly keplerian ellipses . in the frame rotating with the mean motion of the dust particle ,",
    "the orbits appear as retrograde elliptical epicycles with a 2:1 aspect ratio @xcite . when gravity acts alone , the vertical , radial and azimuthal motions all have precisely the same frequency .",
    "equations governing the slow changes to the ellipse s orbital elements due to weak electromagnetic perturbations from a rotating aligned dipole magnetic field are given by @xcite .",
    "these equations show that the three frequencies diverge slightly and are functions of the sign and magnitude of the charge as well as the distance from the planet and synchronous orbit .",
    "conversely , the very smallest dust grains approach the lorentz limit , where the electromagnetic force dominates over gravity . in this regime ,",
    "the frequencies of radial , vertical and azimuthal motions differ significantly .",
    "the radial oscillation is fastest and , as the electromagnetic force is perpendicular to the rotating magnetic field , particles gyrate about local field lines on typical timescales of seconds for dust , and microseconds for ions .",
    "dust grains typically oscillate vertically on a timescale of hours to days . since this timescale is far slower than gyration , an adiabatic invariant exists and",
    "can easily be found . in the absence of forces other than electromagnetism , and ignoring planetary rotation , a",
    "dust grain s speed @xmath0 remains constant : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the speeds perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field lines , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 component determines the radius of the gyrocycle , while the @xmath3 component moves the center of gyration to regions of differing magnetic field strength .",
    "if changes to a non - rotating magnetic field @xmath4 are small over the size and time scales of gyromotion , the ratio @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the local strength of the field , is an adiabatic invariant @xcite and hence is nearly constant .",
    "these two conditions provide an important constraint on the grain s motion parallel to the field lines .",
    "as a grain with a vertical velocity component climbs up a magnetic field line away from the equatorial plane , the field strength @xmath6 increases , @xmath2 also increases , and hence @xmath3 must decrease .",
    "there is thus a restoring force towards the equatorial plane where the magnetic field strength is a local minimum , and the motion parallel to the field lines takes the form of bounce oscillations between mirror points north and south of the equator @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the bounce motion of particles in the lorentz limit at saturn .",
    "their results neglected the effects of planetary rotation , and hence are most applicable to slow rotators like mercury and potentially some planetary satellites .",
    "finally , on the longest timescales ( days ) , particles drift longitudinally with respect to the rotating magnetic field @xcite , forced by a number of effects including gravity , the curvature of the magnetic field , and @xmath7 . because these motions are usually slow compared to the gyration and bounce frequencies , it is often useful to assume that in the lorentz limit , grains are tied to the local field lines .      for a broad range of grain sizes from nanometers to microns , both gravity and the lorentz force",
    "are significant , and their combined effect causes a number of dynamical phenomena that are distinct from either limiting case . as dust in this size range predominates in many planetary rings ( @xcite ) , their dynamics have attracted much attention .    @xcite provide a general framework for the motion of dust started on initially keplerian orbits . since the radial forces on a dust grain at launch",
    "are not balanced as they are for a large parent body on a circular orbit , these dust grains necessarily have non - zero amplitude epicyclic motion . for the magnetic field configurations of the giant planets , a negatively - charged dust grain gyrates towards synchronous orbit while positively - charged dust initially moves away from this location .",
    "in fact , some positively - charged grains are radially unstable and either crash into the planet if launched inside synchronous orbit , or are expelled outwards if launched from beyond this distance .",
    "the latter have been detected as high - speed dust streams near jupiter ( @xcite ) and saturn @xcite .",
    "theoretical explanations for the electromagnetic acceleration process have been given by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored the shape and frequency of epicycles for negatively - charged grains in the transitional regime , where both em effects and gravity are comparable . the epicycles make a smooth transition from perfectly circular clockwise ( retrograde ) gyromotion in the lorentz limit , to 2:1 retrograde elliptical epicycles in the kepler limit .",
    "@xcite studied the shapes of epicyclic motion for positive grains and found that there is not a similarly smooth transition from prograde gyromotion to retrograde kepler epicycles , and that the epicyclic motions of intermediately - sized grains can not be represented as ellipses .",
    "the effects of gravity and electromagnetism compete for intermediate charge - to - mass values and motion can be primarily radial , leading to escape or collision @xcite .",
    "@xcite and northrop and connerney ( 1987 ) studied the vertical motion of negatively - charged dust grains on circular uninclined orbits in a centered and aligned dipole field , a configuration most closely realized by saturn .",
    "they found that some small grains on initially centrifugally - balanced circular trajectories inside the synchronous orbital distance are locally unstable to vertical perturbations , climbing magnetic field lines to crash into the planet at high latitudes .",
    "some motions at high latitude , however , are stable : @xcite identified non - equatorial equilibrium points for charged dust grains , and showed than dust grains can orbit them stably .",
    "they characterized these `` halo '' orbits for positive and negative charged grains on both prograde and retrograde trajectories .",
    "@xcite used these analytical results to argue for a stable population of positively - charged grains in retrograde orbits and developed numerical models of such halo dust populations at saturn .",
    "grains that may populate these halos , however , are unlikely to result from the equatorial launches considered here .    if one of the dust grain s natural frequencies matches a characteristic spatial frequency of the rotating multipolar magnetic field , the particle experiences a lorentz resonance @xcite .",
    "lorentz resonances behave similarly to their gravitational counterparts and can have a dramatic effect on a dust grain s orbit , exciting large radial and/or vertical motions .",
    "these resonances have been primarily studied in the kepler limit appropriate for the micron - sized particles seen in the dusty rings of jupiter . in our idealized problem , with an axisymmetric magnetic dipole , lorentz resonances can not occur .",
    "variations in a dust grain s charge can also alter its trajectory over surprisingly rapid timescales .",
    "gradients in the plasma properties , including density , temperature and even composition affect the equilibrium potential of a grain by altering the direct electron and ion currents .",
    "this can result in resonant charge variation with gyrophase , causing radial drift .",
    "working in the lorentz limit , @xcite noted that with large radial excursions , the grain s speed through the plasma can vary significantly with gyrophase , leading to enhanced charging at one extremity .",
    "a similar effect occurs in the kepler limit where resonant charge variation can cause a dramatic evolution in the orbital elements of a dust grain @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the varying charge has a time lag that depends on the plasma density and grain capacitance .",
    "these time lags can cause grains to drift towards or away from synchronous orbit depending on the grain speed , and on any radial temperature or density gradients in the plasma .",
    "@xcite explored the effects of stochastic charging on extremely small grains , where the discrete nature of charge can not be ignored .",
    "they found that lorentz resonances are robust enough to survive even for small dust grains with only a few electric charges .",
    "the dynamics of time - variable charging may play an important role in determining the structure of saturn s e ring @xcite and jupiter s main ring and halo @xcite .",
    "another example of charge variation occurs when the insolation of a dust grain is interrupted during transit through the planetary shadow .",
    "this induces a variation in charge that resonates with the grain s orbital frequency @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that this shadow resonance excites radial motions while normally leaving vertical structure unaltered .",
    "this effect can explain the appearance of the faint outward extension of jupiter s thebe ring , and the properties of its dust population sampled by the galileo dust detector @xcite .      in this study , we consider the orbits of charged grains launched in planetary ring systems . our aim is to explore the boundaries between stable and unstable orbits in aligned and centered dipolar magnetic fields .",
    "dipolar fields have the advantage of being analytically tractable while still capturing most of the important physics . under",
    "what conditions are grains unstable to vertical perturbations ?",
    "which grains escape the planet as high speed dust streams ? and which grains will strike the planet after launch ? all of these instabilities depend on the launch distance of the grain and its charge - to - mass ratio .",
    "we first explore grain trajectories numerically and then derive analytical solutions for the stability boundaries that we find .",
    "there are several standard choices for expressing the ratio of the lorentz and gravitational forces .",
    "the charge - to - mass ratio @xmath8 in c / kg @xcite or in statcoulomb / g @xcite may be the most straightforward , but it is cumbersome .",
    "for this reason , converting to the grain potential measured in volts , which is constant for different - sized dust grains , is a common choice @xcite .",
    "yet another option is to express the charge - to - mass ratio in terms of frequencies associated with the primary motions of the grain , such as the gyrofrequency , orbital frequency and the spin frequency of the planet ( @xmath9 @xcite ) .",
    "we choose a related path , namely to fold @xmath8 and key planetary parameters into a single dimensionless parameter @xmath10 following @xcite .",
    "consider the lorentz force in a rotating magnetic field : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the speed of light , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the grain s position and velocity in the inertial frame , @xmath15 is the spin vector of the planet , and @xmath4 is the magnetic field .",
    "we use cgs units here and throughout to simplify the appearance of the electromagnetic equations .",
    "the second component of eq .",
    "[ bforce ] is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the so - called co - rotational electric field which acts to accelerate charged grains across magnetic field lines . since a dipolar magnetic field obeys @xmath18 in the midplane ( with @xmath19 the magnetic field strength at the planet s equator ) , @xmath20 , like gravity , is proportional to @xmath21 there .",
    "thus the ratio of the electric force to gravity is both independent of distance and dimensionless : @xmath22 here , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the planetary radius and mass , @xmath25 is the dust grain mass and @xmath26 is the gravitational constant .",
    "note that the the sign of @xmath10 depends on the product of two signed quantities , @xmath27 and @xmath19 .",
    "for all of the giant planets , the magnetic north pole is in the northern hermisphere , and @xmath28 .",
    "however , for the earth at the current epoch , @xmath29 and the magnetic and geographic poles are in opposite hemispheres .",
    "we have made a slight notational change @xmath30 from @xcite to avoid confusion with the l - shell of magnetospheric physics .",
    "choosing @xmath10 as an independent variable takes the place of assuming a particular electric potential , grain size and grain density .",
    "we focus our study primarily on jupiter , the planet with by far the strongest magnetic field , but also apply our results to saturn and to the earth .",
    "approximating jupiter s magnetic field as an aligned dipole by including just @xmath31 gauss @xcite , we tested the stability of dust grain orbits over a range of grain sizes and launch distances both inside and outside synchronous orbit .",
    "we used a runge - kutta fourth - order integrator and launched grains at the local kepler speed with a small initial latitude of @xmath32 .",
    "this tiny nominal value ensures a launch close to the midplane , whilst avoiding potential numerical problems of launching a grain precisely at @xmath33 .",
    "non - zero launch speeds from the parent particle do have a small effect on the stability boundaries , one that we will explore in more depth in a future study .",
    "our models treat the grain charge as constant and neglect @xmath34 , other higher - order components of the gravitational field , and radiation pressure . for both negative and positive grains",
    ", we ran simulations for a grid of 80 values of @xmath10 and 100 launch distances ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the charge - to - mass ratio spans four decades from the lorentz regime where em dominates ( @xmath36 ) , to the kepler regime where gravity reigns ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the range of launch distances extends from the planetary surface to well beyond the synchronous orbital distance ( @xmath38 ) , and trajectories were followed for up to 0.1 years . with some experimentation",
    ", we determined that all relevant dynamical timescales are @xmath39 years and that for longer integration times , the appearance of our stability plots does not change significantly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : g10num ] we plot the fate of 8000 negative and 8000 positive dust grains and find complex regions of instability .",

    "some are bound by high latitude restoring forces ( locally unstable , light grey ) whilst others crash into the planet at high latitude ( both locally and globally unstable , darker grey ) . to separate these globally stable grains from locally stable ones , we choose a latitude threshold at @xmath40 .",
    "although 5@xmath41 is a small latitude , it is far greater than the launch latitude of 0.01@xmath41 ; any grains excited beyond @xmath42 are clearly locally unstable , and we determined that our results were fairly insensitive to actual value of @xmath42 .",
    "@xcite derived a boundary for the threshold between locally stable and unstable trajectories for negatively - charged dust and found that grains launched within a certain distance should leave the equatorial plane ( nh82 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : g10num]a ) . in the lorentz limit",
    ", the vertical instability allows grains to climb up local magnetic field lines into regions of stronger magnetic field , while for smaller @xmath10 the path taken by these grains follows the lines of a pseudo - magnetic field which includes the effects of planetary rotation @xcite .",
    "the northrop curve however , is not a good match to our data which reveal additional stable orbits ( white areas ) immediately inside this boundary and also close to the planetary surface .",
    "these differences arise from the fact that @xcite assumed that grains are launched at their equilibrium circular speeds , which differ from the circular speeds of parent bodies when @xmath43 .",
    "conversely , we launch our grains at @xmath44 , the circular speed of the parent body , which is appropriate for debris produced by cratering impacts into these objects . in section 5 , we develop a vertical stability criterion appropriate for our launch conditions .",
    "the situation for positive grains is quite different .",
    "figure  [ fig : g10num]b shows a less extensive region of vertical instability than fig .  [ fig : g10num]a , and one that is not active close to jupiter .",
