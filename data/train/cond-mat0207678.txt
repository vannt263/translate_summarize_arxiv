    "the basic physics of the elementary one - magnon excitations of lower - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets can now be regarded as well established , both theoretically and experimentally through studies of materials that are reasonably accurate realizations of the spin hamiltonians .",
    "in contrast , higher excitations such as multimagnon continua and bound states have attracted relatively little attention . this topic may prove to be a fascinating area for the application of few- and many - body techniques , and will involve interesting and nontrivial results in band structure , band mixing , bound state formation , phase transitions through the formation of condensates of magnetic excitations oosawa01,nikuniprl2000 , watsonmeisel01,yuhaas00,tsvelikgiamarchi , affleck91,coldea02 , and other collective phenomena .",
    "although some aspects of the physics of low - lying multimagnon states can be inferred from model hamiltonians using standard theoretical techniques , few experimental studies of these higher excitations have been reported to date .",
    "experimental difficulties that have precluded such work include relatively weak couplings of probes to these higher excitations , dominant contributions from the lowest one - magnon excitations , and resolution requirements in energy and wavenumber that are beyond the capabilities of most techniques .",
    "high - resolution inelastic neutron scattering should prove to be an ideal technique for observing some of these higher magnetic excitations .",
    "one can control both energy and momentum transfer , so that the existence and spectral weight of higher magnetic excitations can be established and quantified .",
    "the new generation of high - intensity neutron sources combined with high - resolution detectors should allow the observation of details of the multimagnon excitation spectrum such as band boundaries , quantitative determination of the dynamical correlation function @xmath4 and discontinuities within a band @xcite , and weakly bound states just below the band edge .",
    "the principle limitation in this approach may be the unavoidable @xmath5 selection rule of magnetic neutron scattering , so that one can only reach spin @xmath6 excitations given an @xmath7 ground state and an isotropic spin hamiltonian .",
    "other techniques such as raman scattering can be used to study certain of these higher excitations , _ albeit _ with strong constraints on the accessible spin and momentum quantum numbers .",
    "systems that appear especially interesting for studies of higher magnetic excitations at present are quasi-1d spin chains and spin ladders , since many of these have gaps and hence will have separated bands of higher excitations and perhaps bound states of magnons .",
    "the alternating heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain ( ahc ) with spin-1/2 is an example of such a system ; with any amount of alternation @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 ) the ahc has an energy gap in its one - magnon dispersion with a second gap to the multimagnon continuum , and two - magnon bound states with spin-0 and spin-1 are predicted @xcite .",
    "the ahc is also attractive because of its relative simplicity and because of recent extensive theoretical studies of the low - energy excitations in this model .    in this paper we present results from an inelastic neutron scattering study of higher magnetic excitations in copper nitrate ( cu(no@xmath0)@xmath1d@xmath2o ) , which was recently confirmed by neutron scattering xu00 to be an accurate realization of a strongly alternating heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain .",
