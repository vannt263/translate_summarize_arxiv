    "computer simulation methods have been widely employed in recent years to study the behavior of granular materials . among the numerical techniques , discrete element methods , including _ soft particle molecular dynamics _",
    "( md ) @xcite , _ event - driven _",
    "( ed ) @xcite and _ contact dynamics _ ( cd ) @xcite , constitute an important class where the material is simulated on the level of particles . in such algorithms the trajectory of each particle is calculated as a result of interaction with other particles , confining boundaries and external fields .",
    "the differences between the discrete element methods stem from the way how interactions between the particles are treated , which leads also to different ranges of applicability .    in low density granular systems , where interactions are mainly binary collisions ,",
    "the event - driven method is an efficient technique .",
    "the particles are modeled as perfectly rigid and the contact duration is supposed to be zero .",
    "the handling of dense granular systems , where the frequency of collisions is large or long - lasting contacts appear , becomes problematic in ed simulations @xcite .    in case of dense granular media",
    "the approach of soft particle molecular dynamics is more favorable and widely used . in md , the time step is usually fixed and the original undeformed shapes of the particles may overlap during the dynamics .",
    "these overlaps are interpreted as elastic deformations which generate repulsive restoring forces between the particles .",
    "based on this interaction , which is defined in the form of a visco - elastic force law , the stiffness of the particles can be controlled . when the stiffness is increased md simulations become slower since the time step has to be chosen small enough so that the velocities and positions vary as smooth functions of time .",
    "the contact dynamics method considers the grains as perfectly rigid .",
    "therefore no overlaps between the particles are expected and they interact with each other only at contact points . the contact forces in cd do not stem from visco - elastic force laws but are calculated in terms of constraint conditions ( for more details see sec .  [ cd - method ] ) .",
    "this method has shown its efficiency in the simulation of dense frictional systems of hard particles .",
    "packings of hard particles interacting with repulsive contact forces are extensively used as models of various complex many - body systems , e.g. dense granular materials @xcite , glasses @xcite , liquids @xcite and other random media @xcite .",
    "jamming in hard - particle packings of granular materials has been the subject of considerable interest recently @xcite .",
    "furthermore hard - particle packings , and especially hard - sphere packings , have inspired mathematicians and been the source of numerous challenging theoretical problems @xcite , from which many are still open .",
    "real systems in the laboratory and in nature contain far too large number of particles to model the whole system in computer simulations .",
    "due to the limited computer capacity the simulations are often restricted to test a small mesoscopic part of a large system .",
    "typically , the studies are focused to a local homogeneous small piece of the material inside the bulk far from the border of the system .",
    "therefore simulation methods are required that are able to generate and handle packings of hard particles without side effects of confining walls .",
    "the usual simulation methods of dense systems involve confining boxes where the material is compactified by moving pistons or gravity . however , the properties of the material differ in the vicinity of walls and corners of the confining cell from those in the bulk far from the walls .",
    "the application of walls in computer simulations leads to inhomogeneous systems due to undesired side effects ( e.g. layering effect ) .",
    "moreover , the structure of the packings becomes strongly anisotropic in these cases due to the orientation of walls and special direction of the compaction . for studies where such anisotropy is unwanted other type of compaction methods",
    "are needed .    in this paper",
    ", we present a compaction method where boundary effects are avoided due to exclusion of side walls .",
    "this simulation method is based on the contact dynamics algorithm where we applied the concept of the andersen dynamics @xcite , which enables us to produce homogeneous granular packings of hard particles with desired internal pressure .",
    "the compaction method involves variable volume of the simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we present some basic features of cd method in section  [ cd - method ] .",
    "then , section  [ andersen - method ] describes the equations of motion for a system of particles with variable volume . in section  [ cd+andersen ]",
    "we present a modified version of cd with coupling to an external pressure bath . in section  [ results ]",
    "we report the results of some test simulations . section  [ conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "_ contact dynamics _ ( cd ) , developed by m. jean and j. j. moreau @xcite , is a discrete element method in the sense that the time evolution of the system is treated on the level of individual particles .",
    "once the total force @xmath0 and torque @xmath1 acting on the particle @xmath2 is known , the problem is reduced to the integration of newton s equations of motion which can be solved by numerical methods .",
    "here we use the implicit first order euler scheme : @xmath3 @xmath4 which gives the change in the position @xmath5 and velocity @xmath6 of the center of mass of the particle with mass @xmath7 after the time step @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath8 is chosen so that the relative displacement of adjacent particles during one time step is small compared to the particle size and to the radius of curvature of the contacting surfaces .",
    "corresponding equations are used also for the rotational degrees of freedom , describing the time evolution of the orientation and the angular velocity @xmath9 caused by the new total torque @xmath10 acting on the particle @xmath2 .",
    "the interesting part of the cd method is how the interaction between the particles are handled . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the particles are noncohesive and dry , we exclude electrostatic and magnetic forces between them and consider only interactions via contact forces .",
    "the particles are regarded as _ perfectly rigid _ and the contact forces are calculated in terms of constraint conditions .",
    "such constaints are the impenetrability and the no - slip condition , i.e. the contact force has to prevent the overlapping of the particles and the sliding of the contact surfaces .",
    "this latter condition is valid only below the coulomb limit of static friction , which states that the tangential component of a contact force @xmath11 can not exceed the normal component times the friction coefficient @xmath12 : @xmath13 if the friction is not strong enough to ensure the no - slip condition the contact will be sliding and the tangential component of the contact force is given by the expression @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the tangential component of the relative velocity between the contacting surfaces . in the cd method",
    "the constraint conditions are imposed on the new configuration at time @xmath16 , i.e. , the unknown contact forces are calculated in a way that the constraints conditions are fulfilled in the new configuration @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why an implicit time stepping is used .    in order to let the system evolve one step",
    "from time @xmath17 to @xmath16 one has to determine the total force and torque acting on each particle which may consist of external forces ( like gravity ) and contact forces from neighboring particles .",
    "let us suppose that all the unknown contact forces are already determined except for one force between a pair of particles already in contact or with a small gap between them .",
    "here we explain briefly how the constraint conditions help to determine the interection between these two particles .",
    "a detailed description of the method can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm starts with the assumption that the contact force we are searching for is zero and checks whether this leads to an overlap of the undeformed shapes of the two particles after one time step @xmath8 .",
    "this is done based on the time stepping [ eq .",
    "( [ veloc - update ] ) ] : the external forces and other contact forces provide @xmath18 and @xmath19 for both particles thus the new relative velocity of the contacting surfaces @xmath20 can be calculated .",
    "here we use the term _ contacting surfaces _ for simplicity thought the two particles are not necessarily in contact .",
    "there might be a positive gap @xmath21 between them , which is the length of the shortest line connecting the surfaces of the two particles ( fig .",
    "[ fig - schematiccontact ] ) .",
    "we will refer to the relative velocity of the endpoints of the line as the relative velocity of the contact and denote the direction of the line by the unit vector @xmath22 . in the limit of",
    "a real contact @xmath21 is zero and @xmath22 becomes the contact normal .",
    "negative gap has the meaning of an overlap .",
    "the superscript _ free _ in @xmath20 denotes that the relative velocity has been calculated assuming no interaction between the two particles .",
    "we use the sign convention that negative normal velocity ( @xmath23 ) means approaching particles .",
    "the new value of the gap ( after one time step ) is estimated by the algorithm based on the current gap @xmath21 and the new relative velocity @xmath20 according to the implicit time stepping .",
    "if the new gap is positive : @xmath24 then the zero contact force ( no interaction ) is accepted because no contact is formed between the two particles . however",
    ", if the estimated new gap is negative then a contact force has to be applied in order to avoid the violation of the constraint conditions .",
    "generally , one expects the following relation between the unknown new contact force @xmath11 and the unknown new relative velocity @xmath25 : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass matrix that describes the inertia of the contact , i.e. @xmath28 is the relative acceleration of the contacting surfaces due to the contact force @xmath11 .",
    "the mass matrix @xmath27 depends on the shape , mass and moment of inertia of the two particles . on one hand",
    ", the interpenetration of the two rigid particles has to be avoided , which gives the following constraint for the normal component of @xmath25 : @xmath29 on the other hand , the tangential component of @xmath25 has to be zero in order to ensure the no - slip condition @xmath30 the required contact force that fulfills eqs .",
    "( [ gap - close ] ) and  ( [ no - slip ] ) then reads @xmath31 this contact force is acceptable only if it fulfills the coulomb condition [ eq .",
    "( [ coulomb - cone ] ) ] .",
    "otherwise we can not exploit the non - slip contact assumption . in this case , @xmath15 is not zero , the contact slides and the contact force has to be recalculated .",
    "( [ general - contact - force ] ) and  ( [ gap - close ] ) then provide @xmath32 where the number of unknowns ( components of @xmath11 and @xmath15 ) exceeds the number of equations . in order to determine the contact force @xmath11 one has to solve eq .",
    "( [ contact - force-2 ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ tangential - force ] ) .",
    "it is recommended to use @xmath33 instead of @xmath21 in eqs .",
    "( [ contact - force ] ) and  ( [ contact - force-2 ] ) .",
    "the gap size @xmath21 should always be non - negative and using @xmath34 apparently makes no difference @xcite .",
    "however , due to the inaccuracy of the calculations small overlaps can be created between neighboring particles .",
    "if @xmath21 instead of @xmath34 is used then these overlaps are eliminated in the next time step by imposing larger repulsive contact forces to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ gap - close ] ) , which pumps kinetic energy into the system . using @xmath34 instead of @xmath21",
    "eliminates this artifact on the cost that an already existing overlap is not removed ( which then serves to check the inaccuracies of the simulation @xcite ) , only its further growth is prevented . regarding the above mentioned points , we rewrite the equations  ( [ contact - force ] ) and  ( [ contact - force-2 ] ) as @xmath35    @xmath36    a flowchart of the single contact force calculation is given in fig .",
    "[ fig - flowchart ] .",
    "so far we have explained only how the cd algorithm determines a single existing or incipient contact , based on the assumption that all the surrounding contact forces are known .",
    "however , in a dense granular media , many particles contact simultaneously and form a contact network . in this case",
    ", a contact force can not be evaluated locally , since it depends on the adjacent contact forces which are also unknown . to find a globally consistent force network at each time step , an _ iterative scheme _",
    "is applied in cd .    at each iteration step , all contacts are chosen one by one and the force at the contact is updated according to the scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - flowchart ] .",
    "the update is sequential , i.e. , the freshly updated contact force is stored immediately as the current force and then a new contact is chosen for the next update .",
    "after one iteration step , constraint conditions are not necessarily fulfilled for each contact . in order to find a global solution the iteration process has to be repeated several times until the resulting force network converges .",
    "the convergence of the iteration process is smooth , i.e. , the precision of the solution increases with the number of iterations @xmath37 .",
    "higher @xmath37 provides more precise solution but also requires more computational effort .",
    "the cd method can be used with a constant number of iterations in subsequent time steps @xcite or with a convergence criterion that prescribes a given precision to the force calculation @xcite . in this latter case ,",
    "the number of iterations @xmath37 varies from time step to time step .",
    "after the new force network is determined with a prescribed precision , the system evolves at the end of the time step according to the time - stepping scheme described at the beginning of this section .",
    "it is important to note that choosing small @xmath37 and/or large time step causes systematic errors of the force calculation which lead to a spurious soft particle behavior @xcite in spite of the original assumption of perfect rigidity .    to conclude this section , we present briefly the scheme of the solver .",
    "in the simulation of granular materials , it is often desirable to investigate systems which are not surrounded by walls and to apply periodic boundary conditions in all directions",
    ". it is a nice feature of periodic boundary conditions that they make points of the space equivalent , the boundary effects are eliminated . that way the bulk properties of the material",
    "can be studied more easily .",
    "however , the application of an external pressure becomes problematic since the total volume is fixed and the system can not be compressed by pistons or moving walls .    in order to overcome this problem , but at the same time keep the advantageous periodic boundaries , andersen @xcite proposed a method for molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "here , we recall his method briefly as its basic ideas will be used later on in this paper .    according to the andersen method",
    "the boundaries are still periodically connected in all directions and no walls are present , but the volume of the system is a dynamical variable which evolves in time due to interaction with an external pressure bath .",
    "when a system of @xmath39 atoms is compressed or expanded it is done in an isotropic and homogeneous way : the distances between the atoms are rescaled by the same factor regardless of the relative or absolute positions .",
    "let us give the equations of motion of a system with particle positions @xmath40 in a cubic volume @xmath41 ( each component of @xmath5 is between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-1 ] ) describes the change in the position @xmath5 .",
    "the first term on the right is the usual one , the momentum @xmath47 divided by the mass of the @xmath2th particle .",
    "the last term is the extension by the andersen method that rescales the position according to the relative volume change .",
    "( [ equation - motion-2 ] ) provides the time evolution of the momentum due to two terms .",
    "the first one is the usual total force @xmath0 acting on the @xmath2th particle which originates from the interaction with other particles and/or from external fields .",
    "the additional term leads to further acceleration of the particle if the volume is changing .",
    "e.g. , if the system is compressed the kinetic energy of the particles is increased due to the work done by the compression .",
    "the energy input is achieved by rescaling all particle momenta regardless of their positions .",
    "this is in contrast to usual pistons where the energy enters at the boundary .",
    "( [ equation - motion-3 ] ) can be interpreted as newton s second law that governs the change of the volume .",
    "it describes the time evolution of an imaginary piston which has the inertia parameter @xmath48 and is driven by the generalized force @xmath49 .",
    "this latter is the pressure difference between the external pressure @xmath50 imposed by the pressure bath and the internal pressure of the system @xmath51 .",
    "the pressure difference @xmath52 drives the system towards the external pressure , the sensitivity of the system to this driving force is controlled by the inertia parameter @xmath48 .    in the limit of infinite inertia",
    "@xmath53 together with the initial condition @xmath54 the volume of the system remains constant and eqs .",
    "( [ equation - motion-1 ] ) and  ( [ equation - motion-2 ] ) correspond to the usual newtonian dynamics of the particles .    in order to get more insight into the andersen dynamics",
    "let us consider a simple example of a system of non - interacting particles with all @xmath55 .",
    "initially , the velocities and the volume velocity @xmath56 are set to zero . because the internal pressure @xmath57 is zero",
    "the system with finite inertia @xmath48 and under external pressure @xmath58 will start contracting according to eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-3 ] ) .",
    "the acceleration of the particles [ eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-2 ] ) ] remains zero during the time evolution ; one might say that the particles are standing there all the time .",
    "however , the distances between them are decreasing because of the contraction of the `` world '' around them .",
    "this is caused by the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-1 ] ) while the first term remains zero .",
    "this suggests the picture of an imaginary background membrane that contracts or dilates homogeneously together with the volume and carries the particles along .",
    "the velocity of this background at position @xmath5 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the dilation rate defined by the rate of the relative change in the system size @xmath61 : @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the dimension of the system .",
    "then the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-1 ] ) can be interpreted as the sum of two velocities : the second one is the velocity of the background at the position of the particle and the first one is the intrinsic velocity of the particle measured compared to the background .",
    "the sum of these two forces gives the changing rate of the absolute position @xmath5 . in the rest of the paper",
    "the velocity @xmath6 will refer always to the intrinsic velocity .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-1 ] ) in the following form @xmath64    next we turn to the modelling of granular systems .",
    "our goal is to achieve static granular packings that are compressed from a loose gas - like state . here",
    "again it is advantageous to exclude confining walls and in order to apply pressure and achieve contraction of the volume we will use the concept of the andersen method .",
    "however , the equations of motion will be slightly changed in order to make them suit better to our goals .    in granular materials the interaction between the particles",
    "are dissipative . when the material is poured into a container or is compressed by a piston the particles gain kinetic energy due to the work done by gravity or the piston",
    "all this energy has to be dissipated ( turned into heat ) by the interactions between the particles before the material can settle into a static dense packing of the particles .",
    "this relaxation process requires a massive computational effort when large packings are modeled in computer simulations .",
    "one encounters the same problem if the andersen dynamics is applied straight to granular systems .",
    "the relaxation time can be reduced if the second term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-2 ] ) is omitted , because then the total amount of energy pumped into the system is reduced . in this case",
    "the particles are accelerated only by the forces @xmath65 but they receive no additional energy due to the decreasing volume . thus the following equation will be applied for granular compaction here @xmath66 which results in a more effective relaxation rather than eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-2 ] ) .",
    "this change is advantageous also from the point of view of momentum conservation .",
    "if the system is compactified by using eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion-2 ] ) from an initial condition where the total momentum of the particles is non - zero , then this momentum will be increased inverse proportionally to the size of the system @xmath61 .",
    "thus the total momentum e.g. due to initial random fluctuations is magnified which can lead to non - negligible overall rigid body motion of the final static packing .",
    "this is in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion - new-2 ] ) which provides momentum conservation in the absence of external fields .    concerning the equation that describes the time evolution of the system size we find it more convenient to control @xmath60 instead of @xmath67 .",
    "this is actually not an important change and leads to very similar dynamics .",
    "our third equation reads @xmath68    the equations of motion  ( [ equation - motion - new-1 ] ) , ( [ equation - motion - new-2 ] ) and ( [ equation - motion - new-3 ] ) describe an effective compaction dynamics for granular systems , they are able to provide static packings under the desired pressure @xmath50 and if they are restricted to the limit of @xmath69 we receive back the classical newtonian dynamics .    of course , in order to close the equations we need to define interactions between the particles .",
    "the interparticle forces provide @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ equation - motion - new-2 ] ) and they are also needed to evaluate the inner pressure @xmath57 .",
    "the stress tensor @xmath70 is not apriori spherical in granular materials .",
    "the average @xmath70 of the system is determined by the interparticle forces @xcite and the particle velocities as @xmath71 where @xmath39 and @xmath72 denote the number of particles and the number of contacts , respectively .",
    "if two contacting particles at contact @xmath73 are labelled by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , then @xmath76 is the force exerted on particle @xmath75 by particle @xmath74 , and the vector @xmath77 is pointing from the center of mass of particle @xmath74 to that of particle @xmath75 where periodic boundary conditions and nearest image neighbors are taken into account . thus @xmath78 is the minimum distance between particles @xmath74 and @xmath75 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an integer - component translation vector . the inner pressure is then given by the trace of the stress tensor divided by the dimension of the system @xmath81 ,       \\label{inner - pressure}\\ ] ] which has the meaning of an average normal stress .",
    "the implementation of the above method in computer simulations is straightforward if the interparticle forces are functions of the positions and velocities of the particles , e.g. , in soft particle md simulations .",
    "the implementation is less trivial for the case of the contact dynamics method where interparticle forces are constraint forces .",
    "we devote the next section to this problem .",
    "in this section we present a modified version of the contact dynamics algorithm which enables us to perform cd simulations when the system is in contact with an external pressure bath . according to sec .",

    "such parameters are the external pressure @xmath50 , the inertia parameter @xmath95 and the computational parameters , like the number of iterations per time step @xmath115 and the length of the time step @xmath8 .",

    "if the level of the sensitivity is too small or too large , the simulation becomes inefficient .",
    "it is advantageous to choose the inertia @xmath95 near to its optimal value which depends on the specific system ( e.g. on the number and mass of the particles ) @xcite .        regarding the efficiency of the computer simulation , not only the computational expenses play an important role but the accuracy of the simulation is also essential . here",
    "we use the overlaps of the particles as a measure of the inaccuracy of the simulation ( see sec .  [ cd - method ] ) . in an ideal case",
    "there would be no overlaps between perfectly rigid particles .",
    "[ fig - overlaps ] shows the mean overlaps measured in the final packings .",
    "it can be seen for the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath8 and @xmath115 that the reduction of the computational expenses at the same time leads also to the reduction of the accuracy of the simulation . in fig .",
    "[ fig - cputime - overlap](left ) we plot the cpu time versus the mean overlap for these three parameters .",
    "the data points collapse approximately on the same master curve which tells us that the computational expenses are determined basically by the desired accuracy ; smaller errors require more computations .",
    "the efficiency of the simulation is approximately independent of the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath8 and @xmath115 .",
    "the situation is , however , different for the inertia of the system @xmath95 .",
    "first , it has relatively small effect on the accuracy of the simulation ( fig .  [ fig - overlaps ] ) .",
    "variation of @xmath95 by @xmath133 orders of magnitude could hardly change the mean overlap of the particles .",
    "second , @xmath95 affects strongly the efficiency of the simulation which is shown clearly by fig .",
    "[ fig - cputime - overlap](right ) .",
    "if @xmath95 is varied then larger computational expense is not necessarily accompanied with smaller errors .",

    "[ fig - cputime - overlap](right ) ] .         and [ fig - overlaps ] .",

    "the open circle on the right indicates the most efficient simulation we could achieve by controlling the inertia @xmath95.,title=\"fig : \" ]    next we turn to the question whether the parameters of the simulation used in the compaction process influence the physical properties of the final packing .",
    "there are many ways to characterize static packings of disks . here",
    "we test only one quantity , the frequently used volume fraction .",
    "the volume fraction gives the ratio between the total volume ( total area in 2d ) of grains and the volume ( area ) of the system .",
    "[ fig - volumefraction ] shows the volume fraction of the same packings that were studied already in fig .",
    "[ fig - overlaps ] .",
    "it can be seen that the volume fraction remains approximately unchanged under the variation of the four parameters @xmath50 , @xmath115 , @xmath8 and @xmath95 .",
    "this is except for one data point for large time step @xmath8 , where the simulation is very inaccurate .",
    "the corresponding mean overlap ( fig .",
    "[ fig - overlaps ] ) is comparable to the typical size of the particles which is the reason why the volume fraction appears to be much larger .",
    "finally , we investigate the inner structure of the resulting random packings . for that",
    ", we study larger samples with @xmath134 particles , otherwise , the default parameters are used during the compaction .",
    "to suppress random fluctuations , we produce @xmath135 different systems and all quantities reported hereafter represent average values over these systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig - contactdensity](left ) we study the angular distribution of the contact normals and find that it is very close to uniform .",
    "however , there is a small but definite deviation ( around @xmath136 ) : the density of the contact normals are slightly larger parallel to the periodic boundaries . in this sense",
    "the packing is not completely isotropic .",
    "although the effect is very small , the orientation of the boundaries can be observed also in such local quantities like the direction of the contacts .",
    "disks in both figures.,title=\"fig : \" ]   disks in both figures.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in connection to the question of the isotropy we checked also the global stress tensor @xmath137 . in the original frame",
    "@xmath137 reads @xmath138 this stress is isotropic with good approximation .",
    "the diagonal entries are close to @xmath74 which equals @xmath50 while the off - diagonal elements are approximately zero .",
    "compared to the unit matrix , the elements deviate around @xmath139 of @xmath50 .",
    "the final packings are expected to be homogeneous as all points of the space are handled equivalently by the compaction method .",
    "apart from random fluctuations we do not observe any inhomogeneity in our test systems .",
    "as an example , we show the spatial distribution of the contacts in fig .",
    "[ fig - contactdensity](right ) , where the density is approximately constant .",
    "in this work we have proposed and tested a simulation method to produce homogeneous random packings in the absence of confining walls .",
    "we combined the contact dynamics algorithm with a modified version of the andersen method to handle granular systems which are in contact with an external pressure bath .",
    "our main concern was to discuss how constraint conditions can be applied to determine the interaction between the particles in an andersen - type of dynamics .",
    "we have presented the results of some numerical tests and discussed the effect of the main parameters on the efficiency of the simulations and on the physical properties of the final packings .",
    "we restricted our study to the simple case where we allow only spherical strain of the system in order to achieve the desired pressure .",
    "however , the method can be generalized to apply other type of constraints to the stress tensor and , consequently , to allow more general strain deformations where shape as well as size of the simulation cell can be varied @xcite .",
