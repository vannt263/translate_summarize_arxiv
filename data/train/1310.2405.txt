    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) , as a major practical application of quantum information , allows two distant parties to share a common secret key for cryptography in an untrusted environment@xcite .",
    "its security is guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "qkd with continuous - variable , which is an alternative to the single - photon - based discrete - variable quantum key distribution(dv - qkd ) , encodes information on the quadratures of a gaussian state@xcite . any eavesdropping will introduce extra noise between two legal communication parties , who can realize eve s existence by detecting the excess noise .    the gaussian modulated cv - qkd protocols , which have been experimentally demonstrated both in laboratory@xcite and field test@xcite , are proven secure against collective attacks@xcite and coherent attacks@xcite .",
    "they use homodyne detectors instead of the single - photon counters employed in dv - qkd systems , and are more attractive from a practical point of view . by using the multi - dimensional reverse reconciliation@xcite ,",
    "the secure transmission distance can be extended to as long as 80km@xcite .",
    "most of the existing cv - qkd systems are pulsed systems and the secret key bit rate @xmath1 can be expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the pulse repetition rate and @xmath4 is the secret key rate(bit per pulse ) . comparing with classical communication systems , the secret key bit rate of cv - qkd is still low , ranging from several bits / s to hundreds of kbits / s at the distance of more than 25km@xcite .",
    "there are three possible approaches to solve this problem .",
    "the first one is to improve the secret key rate @xmath4 , which is a diminishing function of the transmission distance and sensitive to the excess noise .",
    "so at long transmission distance the secret key rate is much smaller than @xmath5 bit per pulse .",
    "the second approach is to increase the frequency of pulse repetition rate , which requires faster data acquisition cards , wider bandwidth of quantum detectors and the higher speed of post - processing procedure .",
    "the third approach is to use the multiplexing technique , which allows to deliver @xmath0 independent secret keys in a single fiber .",
    "this method was initially realized by using the wavelength division multiplexing(wdm ) devices , which needs @xmath0 coherent laser sources with different central frequencies , and each channel needs individual amplitude and phase modulators .",
    "so the wdm scheme can be just deemed as a combination of several independent qkd systems .",
    "interestingly , the subcarrier multiplexing technique , which was employed in the field of microwave photonics and the radio - on - fiber(rof ) systems , has been proven useful in the bb84 protocol recently@xcite . in their scheme , the sender alice",
    "randomly encodes one of the discrete phases @xmath6 on several radio - frequency(rf ) oscillators and the receiver bob decodes them by using the oscillators of the identical frequencies as alice .",
    "this method requires a frequency locking module between two distant parties , which may increase the complexity of the whole system .    inspired by this method , we propose a new scheme to employ the subcarrier multiplexing technique in the gaussian modulated cv - qkd protocol .",
    "different from ref.@xcite , each rf oscillator is modulated with continuous phase and amplitude information , while the system does not require frequency locking . in our proposal ,",
    "the subcarrier frequencies are evenly separated .",
    "we consider the influence of nonlinear signal mixing and analyze the security against collective attacks .",
    "the results are attractive .",
    "the gaussian modulation of each channel will introduce a non - gaussian extra noise which is generated from the continuous information modulated on other channels .",
    "this extra noise is proportional to alice s modulation variance and can not be neglected .",
    "we evaluate the secret key bit rate in the asymptotic limit for both each channel and the whole system .",
    "results indicate that the extra source noise will slightly reduce of the maximum transmission distance , while the total secret key rate can be considerably increased .",
    "also each channel could generate the independent secret keys at the same time , meaning the key distribution in the multi - channel system is parallel .",
    "this scheme could be used to distribute keys to multi - users .",
    "combined with current wdm technique , the multi - channel scheme has the potential to construct a cv - qkd network .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sec.[s2 ] , a brief review of the gaussian protocol is given . in sec.[s3 ] , we describes the principle of the multi - channel scheme . in sec.[s4 ]",
    "the effect the nonlinear signal mixing is studied to derive the expression of the extra source noise due to intermodulaton .",
    "we construct the entanglement - based scheme in sec.[s5 ] and use it to analyze the security under collective attacks .",
    "the results of numerical simulation and the discussion are provided in sec.[s6 ] and the conclusions are drawn in sec.[s7 ] .",
    "the gaussian cv - qkd protocols are based on the gaussian modulation of a gaussian state of light which could be coherent state@xcite , squeezed state@xcite or thermal state@xcite . from practical point of view , the most suitable protocol for experimental demonstration is the gaussian modulated coherent state(gmcs ) quantum cryptography protocol , which was proposed by f. grosshans and p. grangier in 2002@xcite .",
    "the gmcs protocol requires two independent gaussian distributed modulation with the identical variance @xmath7 on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quadratures of a coherent state .",
    "expressed in terms of phase and amplitude , the distribution corresponds to a uniform modulation of the phase in @xmath10 $ ] and a rayleigh distribution of amplitude with the probability density function @xmath11 where @xmath12    alice s",
    "modulated states are sent to bob through the quantum channel .",
    "the quantum channel is featured by the transmission efficiency @xmath13 and excess noise @xmath14 , resulting in a noise variance of @xmath15 at bob s input .",
    "different from dv - qkd protocol , the gmcs protocol requires a strong local oscillator(lo ) . in order to ensure the lo and signal light having the identical mode , both",
    "the lo and signal light are generated by alice using an unbalanced beam splitter(bs ) from the same pulsed coherent laser .",
    "then alice applies time multiplexing and polarization multiplexing techniques to let the lo and signal propagate in the same fiber .",
    "when bob receives the states , he first uses the demultiplexing devices to separate the lo and quantum signal .",
    "then he performs homodyne detection , randomly measuring the @xmath8 or @xmath9 quadrature . to measure the quadrature @xmath9 , he dephases the local oscillator by @xmath16",
    ". then alice and bob performs classical data processing , including the reconciliation and privacy amplification , and finally share the common secret keys from the accumulated data .",
    "the operation principle of the multi - channel scheme is shown in fig.[layout ] .",
    "alice uses a beam splitter(bs ) to separate the coherent pulsed laser source centered at @xmath17 into two beams : one is weaker and the other is stronger .",
    "the weaker beam is prepared for generating quantum signals while the stronger beams is used for local oscillators(lo ) .",
    "the optical field is assumed to be quasi - monochrimatic , i.e. the spectral width @xmath18 of the pulse spectrum is much smaller than its central frequency @xmath17 .",
    "this assumption is always satisfied when the pulse width is larger than @xmath19ps@xcite .",
    "the quantized single mode electric field @xmath20 of the signal light before modulation can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23^\\dag $ ] .",
    "@xmath24 is the dielectric permittivity and @xmath25 denotes the mode volume .",
    "@xmath26 is the imaginary unit . @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the positive - frequency and negative - frequency components of the quantized electric field , respectively .",
    "@xmath29 is the dimensionless complex amplitude operator which can decomposed by two quadratures as @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath31 and @xmath32 are conjugated , we only need to consider the positive - frequency component in following discussions , while the identical results could be obtained from the negative one by similar methods .",
    "signal light is externally modulated through a phase modulator(pm@xmath33 ) by @xmath0 radio - frequency(rf ) subcarriers .",
    "each subcarrier , which is generated from a voltage control oscillator(vco ) of frequency @xmath34 , is independently amplitude - modulated by a rayleigh distributed random number @xmath35 and phase - modulated by a uniform distributed random number @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "all the modulated rf signals are combined together with a bias voltage @xmath37 .",
    "then the voltage applied on pm@xmath33 is expressed as @xmath38 after alice s phase modulation , the positive - frequency component turns to : @xmath39\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\hat{e}^+(t ) e^{i\\theta_b}\\exp{\\left[i\\sum_{k=1}^{n}m_k\\cos(\\omega_kt+\\phi_k)\\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the half - wave voltage of the phase modulator .",
    "this equation can be written as taylor expansion with following form @xmath43^n\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cong&\\hat{e}^+(t)e^{i\\theta_b}\\big[1+\\frac{i}{2}\\sum_{\\substack{k =- n\\\\k\\neq0}}^nm_ke^{-i(\\omega_kt+\\phi_k)}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{i^2}{8}\\sum_{\\substack{r , s =- n\\\\r , s\\neq0}}^nm_rm_se^{-i[(\\omega_{r}+\\omega_{s})t+\\phi_r+\\phi_s]}\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we define @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 for any integer @xmath47 .",
    "here we use the second - order taylor expansion because when @xmath48 is small enough , e.g. @xmath49 , the effect of higher - order terms is negligible@xcite .",
    "then the signal field at frequency @xmath50 is : @xmath51 where @xmath52    similar as the form of eq.([et ] ) , we can rewritten the expression of @xmath53 as following : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a new dimensionless complex amplitude operator of mode @xmath50 and can be expressed as : @xmath56    if we adjust the bias phase @xmath57 to @xmath58 , then the @xmath59 quadrature of @xmath60 becomes @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the norm of @xmath29 .",
    "the expression of @xmath63 can be obtained by interchanging the @xmath64 and @xmath65 functions in eq.([xsk ] ) .",
    "the compound signal then passes through an optical filter , which blocks all the subcarriers below the frequency @xmath66 .",
    "this is because the subcarrier phase modulation in pm@xmath33 encodes the same information ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) on both the subcarriers centered at @xmath50 and @xmath69 , while we only use the positive frequency components for quantum key distribution .",
    "the local oscillator(lo ) light can also be generated by the similar way as the signal light .",
    "the difference is that the voltage applied on the lo s modulator does not contain randomly modulated information . therefore the modulation voltage of lo can be written as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the amplitude voltage of each rf component and @xmath72 is the bias voltage .",
    "since lo is usually much larger(typically @xmath73 times ) than the quantum signal , it can be deemed as a classical optical field @xmath74 .",
    "so the lo light after modulator pm@xmath75 is : @xmath76,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "if bias phase @xmath79 is adjust to @xmath80 , then the local oscillator light at frequency @xmath50 is @xmath81 in which the parameter @xmath82 is : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the numbers of terms satisfied @xmath85 .",
    "the values of @xmath84 can be calculated by enumeration method .",
    "we also derive the analytical expression of @xmath84 as @xmath86 for a given total channel numbers @xmath0 , @xmath84 satisfies the following inequation : @xmath87 when @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the impact introduced by nonlinear signal mixing on @xmath90 is less than @xmath91 , which could be neglected",
    ". therefore the lo field of each channel has the constant value @xmath92 as shown in fig[layout ] . in order to reduce the effect of scattering and nonlinearity in the fiber ,",
    "the lo power should not be high enough .",
    "as the signal light , the lo is also filtered the subcarriers below @xmath17 . then the compound signal light and lo light are polarization multiplexed into the quantum channel and transmitting to bob .    after receiving the states sent by alice ,",
    "bob firstly separates the compound signal and lo by using a polarization beam splitter(pbs ) .",
    "then he uses an erbium - doped optical fiber amplifier(edfa ) to amplify the lo to a considerable power and randomly phases the lo by @xmath93 to select the measurement basis .",
    "the random basis choosing procedure is determined by a binary random number generator which bob holds its result as @xmath94 .",
    "he then uses two arrayed - waveguide gratings(awg ) to filter out each subcarrier and performs balanced homodyne detection on each pairs of signal and lo(both are centered at frequency @xmath50 ) .",
    "finally , alice and bob perform classical data processing , including the reverse reconciliation and the privacy amplification .",
    "after these stages , they share @xmath0 channel independent secret keys and the key distribution is completed .    in this paper",
    ", we consider three different frequency spacing plans : the low - plan(@xmath95 ) with evenly spaced(e.g .",
    "@xmath96 ) channels from 5 to 25ghz , the medium - plan(@xmath97 ) with evenly spaced channels from 2 to 30ghz and the high - plan(@xmath98 ) with evenly spaced channels from 1 to 40ghz . from practical point of view , 40ghz phase modulators are currently commercially available and the ultra - narrow band awg devices with 1ghz channel spacing have been experimentally demonstrated@xcite .",
    "so it is reasonable for us considering these cases .",
    "according to the eq.([xsk ] ) , the expression of @xmath99 can be written as two parts : @xmath100 where @xmath101 since @xmath67 follows a rayleigh distribution @xmath102 and @xmath68 follows a uniform distribution in @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath103 follows the gaussian distribution @xmath104 , which is identical to the modulation in gaussian cv - qkd protocol .",
    "the second part , @xmath105 , can be seen as a modulation noise .",
    "notice that @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . for different @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the random variables @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 are mutually independent and follow the same gaussian distribution @xmath117",
    ". hence the probability density function of @xmath118(also for @xmath119 ) is given by@xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the zero order modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath122 is the delta function .",
    "the mean values of the products are @xmath123 while the variances are @xmath124 .",
    "so the variance of the term @xmath125 is @xmath126    as shown in sec.[s2 ] , the total number of combinations satisfied @xmath127 is @xmath84 . for an odd integer @xmath128 , the combination @xmath129 does not exist , so @xmath130 can only be decomposed by the combinations of @xmath131 .",
    "since @xmath132 and @xmath133 are commutable , the term @xmath125 exists twice .",

    "so in this case @xmath137 becomes : @xmath138=\\frac{\\alpha_0 ^ 2}{16}m_2(n , k)\\sigma^4,\\ ] ] which is identical with the case of odd @xmath128 .",
    "the variance of @xmath139 can be derived in the similar way .",
    "we assign the variance of @xmath103 as @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath141 , the mean value of @xmath67 should be @xmath142 .",
    "then the variance of variance of @xmath143 can be expressed in terms of @xmath144 and @xmath7 as @xmath145 and finally we get @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the noise variance due to intermodulation defined in eq.([esk ] ) . from a physical point of view",
    ", the generation of @xmath147 is the result of the nonlinear mixing between different modulated rf signals . as shown in eq.([vs ] ) and ( [ est ] ) , although the rf voltages are combined linearly , phase modulation is not a linear process . therefore the quadratures of a certain channel will be effected by the nonlinear mixing from other channels . in addition , since the modulated information of each channel is independent , the extra source noise is also independent of the the gaussian modulation of each channel .",
    "hence it could be treated as a noise term in our analysis .",
    "fig.[mnk ] shows the ratio @xmath148 in terms of the channel index @xmath128 when @xmath98 .",
    "we find that the first channel ( @xmath149 ) has the maximum value of @xmath150 while the last channel ( @xmath151 ) has the minimum one of @xmath152 .",
    "other channels are placed between the first and last cases .",
    "when @xmath0 is large , e.g. @xmath98 , the maximal value of @xmath148 is approximately double of the minimal one .",
    "notice that although each quadrature of @xmath7 follows a gaussian distribution , @xmath147 is not a gaussian noise .",
    "this situation is different from previous study about the source noise which assuming to be gaussian@xcite . according to eq.([esk ] ) , since the extra source noise is proportional to @xmath7 , it can not be suppressed by increasing the variance of the modulation and then attenuating the state . so this noise must be taken into account in both theoretical analysis and actual experiments .     in terms of the channel index @xmath128 .",

    "@xmath105 and @xmath139 are the added non - gaussian noise with variance @xmath147 .",
    "so the variance of @xmath143 and @xmath63 are : @xmath167 and the conditional variances @xmath168 and @xmath169 are@xcite : @xmath170    in the equivalent entanglement - based scheme , which is shown in fig.[pm - eb](b ) , fred generates a pure three - mode entanglement state @xmath171 satisfied @xmath172 .",
    "the quadratures @xmath173 denote the state sent to bob , and @xmath174 denote the state kept by alice . here",
    "we assume that @xmath173 and @xmath174 satisfy the following relations : @xmath175 where @xmath176 .",
    "according to the uncertainty relation@xcite , we have @xmath177 and @xmath178 may not saturate the limit in eq.([limit ] ) .",
    "so it can be reasonably assumed that @xmath179 in the e - b scheme , when alice takes a heterodyne detection on @xmath180 and @xmath181 simultaneously , the measurement values can be expressed as @xmath182 and @xmath183 , where @xmath184 .",
    "alice s best estimation of @xmath185 is denoted by @xmath186 which satisfied@xcite @xmath187 and finally we have @xmath188 and @xmath189 , which has the identical results as in the p&m scheme . if we hide the entanglement source and alice s detection in a black box , the eavesdropper can not distinguish which scheme is applied .",
    "so we can conclude that this e - b scheme is equivalent to the p&m scheme .",
    "in the p&m scheme , bob s imperfect detector is featured by a detection efficiency @xmath190 and the electric noise variance @xmath191 .",
    "we could define an added noise @xmath192 referred to bob s input as @xmath193 . in the e - b scheme ,",
    "it is modeled by a beam splitter with transmission of @xmath190 coupled with an einstein - podolsky - rosen(epr ) state of variance @xmath194 .",

    "the variance @xmath194 should be chosen as @xmath196 .      in this section ,",
    "we consider the security of the multi - channel cv - qkd protocol with reverse reconciliation .",
    "according to the fact that coherent attacks are the most powerful eavesdropping attacks and are not more efficient than collective attacks@xcite , we will analyze the security against collective attacks .    since the quadrature information of each channel is independent , we assume eve s attacks of every channel also independent of others .",

    "@xmath269 descends rapidly with the increment of @xmath205 and finally falls to zero when @xmath265 reaches its maximum transmission distance . in short distance ranges(e.g .",
    "@xmath275 ) , the multi - channel system has a great improvement on the total secret key bit rate with a gain of about @xmath0 times .",
    "in summary , we present a scheme for continuous variable quantum key distribution using the subcarrier multiplexing technique in microwave photonics .",
    "we study the generation of both the subcarrier signal and the local oscillator light .",
    "we also analyze the influence of nonlinear signal mixing and the extra source noise due to intermodulation .",
    "we find the extra source noise is non - gaussian distributed and proportional to the modulation variance @xmath7 .",
    "then we investigate the security against collective attacks and evaluate the lower bound for the secret key rate .",
    "our results show that by using this multiplexing technique , the maximum transmission distance of each channel will decreased slightly , while the total secret key rate could have a considerable improvement .",
    "we also notice that our scheme could be used for key distribution for multi users . as shown in sec.[s4 ] , each channel generates an independent secret key at the same time , meaning the key distribution in the multi - channel system is parallel .",
    "this scheme could be used for one alice to distribute keys to several bobs . limited by the electro - optic modulators , the bandwidth occupied by the multi - channel scheme is under 100ghz , which is smaller than the interval of wdm devices .",
    "so several multi - channel cv - qkd systems with different central frequencies could be combined with wdm devices , resulting in a potential to construct a cv - qkd network .",
    "future work will be the experiments of generating the multi - channel signals and the demonstration of the multi - channel cv - qkd system .",
