    "all of the local group dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies have velocity dispersions much larger than expected for self - gravitating stellar systems , implying that their dynamics is dominated by dark matter , with the stars being little more than dynamical tracers within a dark halo ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "some dsphs have central mass to light ratios of @xmath4 , and average mass to light ratios of several hundred ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite discovered a new candidate dsph in ursa major in a search of data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite . located about @xmath5 from the galaxy , its half - light radius is @xmath6 , covering @xmath7 on the sky .",
    "most remarkably , with @xmath8 , it is about five times less luminous than the faintest previously known dsph andix @xcite and about eight times less luminous than the faintest galactic dsphs umi and draco @xcite .    in this paper , we describe precise radial velocity measurements of seven umajor candidate stars .",
    "we compute umajor s inferred central density and mass , and discuss how umajor fits into the rest of the rest of the dsph population within the context of standard cdm theory .",
    "we selected candidate stars from data release three of sdss , picking targets within @xmath9 of umajor s position as given by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows the color magnitude diagram of the central @xmath9 region , slightly smaller than willman s half - light radius @xmath10 . the giant branch and horizontal branch are both visible , although together they contain only about 50 stars .",
    "our seven targets ( dark circles in figure [ fig : cmd ] ) were drawn from the brightest part of the giant branch , and span the magnitude range @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "additionally , we observed the bright velocity standards hd107328 , hd90861 , and hd132737 .",
    "we observed our stars using the upgraded hires @xcite echelle spectrograph on the keck i telescope on the night of may 17 , 2005 .",
    "each star was observed in one integration lasting 1800s .",
    "the long spectral coverage of the spectrograph allowed us to obtain wavelengths from h@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) to the red - most line of the calcium triplet ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the signal to noise varied among the spectra from @xmath16 to 3 per pixel , or @xmath17 to 17 per  .",
    "only the red - most ca triplet line was near a sky line , but sky subtraction was generally clean even in this case .",
    "we extracted the spectra using the makee data reduction package for hires , creating flux and variance spectra for each echelle order .",
    "because the latest version of makee for the new three - chip upgrade to hires does not at present solve for the dispersion , we fit the dispersion solution manually for the relevant echelle orders using iraf .",
    "all calibration arc exposures had to be taken during the afternoon or morning because of persistent ghosting with the new chips .",
    "to verify instrument stability , we measured the positions of sky lines in the science exposures , and found them to be constant within @xmath18 .",
    "for each of the four stellar absorption lines of interest ( h@xmath13 and the three ca lines ) , we cross - correlated a synthetic gaussian template with the appropriate echelle order using the iraf fxcor package . in all cases except for the third ca triplet line for the faintest umajor star",
    ", we obtained a clear cross - correlation function peak .",
    "a potential problem with single - slit observations is that mis - centering of the star on the slit will produce a velocity offset common to all orders . to address this problem",
    ", we note that telluric absorption lines experience the same spurious velocity shift as stellar absorption lines , and can be used to adjust the velocity back to its correct value .",
    "accordingly , we computed a velocity adjustment using telluric absorption features around @xmath19 . using a template created from the telluric lines from one of the bright standard stars , we used cross - correlation to compute relative velocity adjustments of the other stars . in all cases ,",
    "the adjustment was less than @xmath20 .",
    "an additional potential source of inaccuracy is template mismatch ; for instance , the h@xmath13 line is actually a blend of several different transitions , and may not be exactly at the template wavelength . to address this problem",
    ", we adjusted all of the velocities for each stellar line en masse relative to the second ca line by computing the median velocity difference between the line and the second ca line .",
    "this procedure introduced a shift of at most @xmath21 .",
    "next , we treated each velocity for each stellar line as an independent measurement , and combined them to obtain a final velocity and error . finally , we shifted the entire velocity set to bring the standards into agreement with their published velocities , with a final scatter of @xmath22 , slightly larger then the intrinsic standard star uncertainty of @xmath23 . for each star",
    ", we obtained two error estimates : @xmath24 , obtained by rescaling the nominal iraf fxcor velocity errors to give the expected @xmath25 ; and @xmath26 , obtained from the empirical velocity scatter among individual lines . for umajor stars ,",
    "the two errors are generally similar , but @xmath24 apparently overestimates the errors for the bright standard stars .",
    "table [ table : stars ] shows the results for our seven target stars .    in figure [",
    "fig : vels ] , we show the velocities as a function of magnitude . objects 3 and 4 are clearly outliers , separated about @xmath27 from the other five objects .",
    "the equivalent width of the ca triplet can be used as a measure of a star s metallicity , for known surface gravity ( dwarf vs. giant ) ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ? * ) . to establish whether the kinematical outliers are members of the umajor population",
    ", we computed the equivalent width of the ca triplet lines by fitting them with a lorentzian profile plus a linear continuum , and then integrating the difference between the line profile fit and the continuum fit .",
    "we compute the uncertainties of the equivalent widths using a monte - carlo procedure : we generated simulated data using our best fit solution added to the empirical noise spectrum output by the makee reduction package , and fit the simulated data in the same manner as the real data .",
    "figure [ fig : ew ] shows the equivalent widths for the three ca lines .",
    "the kinematical outliers 3 and 4 clearly have a larger equivalent width for the second and third ca lines , although the first line shows no difference .",
    "object 7 produces very poor fits because the lines are barely discernible above the noise , and its equivalent widths are highly suspect .",
    "generally , only the second and third lines are used for metallicity determination @xcite , so the absence of an effect for the weaker first line is not a source of concern . however , for a fixed metallicity , the equivalent width is anti - correlated with magnitude with a slope about @xmath28 per magnitude @xcite , so that it appears anomalous that star 6 has a larger equivalent width than the brighter stars 1 , 2 , and 5 . to be cautious , we consider the possibility that both 6 and 7 are non - members .",
    "the simple rms line of sight dispersion of the five member objects ( 1,2,5,6 , and 7 ) is @xmath29 , to which measurement errors contribute only slightly . to compute the dispersion",
    "@xmath30 more rigorously , we assume that the objects are drawn from a gaussian distribution , and apply equation 2 of @xcite , imposing an _ a priori _ maximum value of @xmath31 on the dispersion , and using @xmath26 as the velocity uncertainty .",
    "we do not consider the effect of binary stars , which is generally small . including all member stars , we obtain @xmath1 , where the uncertainties are @xmath32 , defined such that 16% of the probability distribution is both above and below the error interval .",
    "if we omit object 7 , then we have @xmath33 , and if we omit both 6 and 7 , @xmath34 .",
    "for these three cases , in the same order , we are confident with 95% certainty that the dispersion is greater than 6.5 , 7.3 , and 4.7 @xmath35 .    assuming five genuine members with a true dispersion of @xmath36 , the systemic heliocentric velocity of umajor is @xmath37 .",
    "the central mass to light ratio of a stellar system with an isotropic orbital distribution and constant @xmath38 may be expressed as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a luminosity distribution dependent factor always close to 1 , @xmath41 is the half - light radius , and @xmath42 is the surface brightness @xcite . using umajor",
    "s approximate published total luminosity @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and half - light radius @xmath45 @xcite , we obtain a central surface brightness of @xmath46 . assuming that @xmath47 , one then obtains @xmath48 , as one might expect for a system that is nearly an order of magnitude fainter than known dark - matter dominated dsphs , but has the same dispersion . the central density is then @xmath49 using the above equation , or @xmath50 using the formula @xmath51 @xcite . despite umajor s extreme @xmath38 ,",
    "its density is within a factor of two of that of several other dsphs @xcite .",
    "several important caveats apply , however .",
    "first , we have identified the half - light radius with the half - brightness radius , when in truth they differ . if umajor has a plummer profile , for example , then @xmath52 , and we underestimate @xmath38 substantially .",
    "next , the above formula for @xmath53 strictly applies only to systems with constant @xmath38 , whereas a dwarf with a halo has varying @xmath38 , a fact that is often ignored when computing @xmath38 using core fitting .",
    "thus the above values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 are intrinsically imprecise , and are useful primarily as relative values to compare with other dsphs having similarly computed qualities .",
    "an alternative approach to computing the mass of the system is the projected mass estimator @xcite , whereby the mass of a system with measured radial velocities @xmath56 at projected radii @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a constant depending on the mass and light distributions of the system . for our five - member umajor data , this becomes @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite compute @xmath59 for the general case of measuring the mass between radii @xmath61 to @xmath62 for a @xmath63 tracer population in a @xmath64 potential . taking @xmath65 from our innermost star and assuming that all the stars are within the half - light radius so that @xmath66 , and assuming that @xmath67 , with a halo having a flat rotation curve ( @xmath68 ) , we obtain @xmath69 , again giving @xmath70 and @xmath71 inside the region observed",
    ". the mass varies from @xmath72 to @xmath73 as @xmath74 ranges from 2 to 6 .",
    "we further note that dsphs for which radially extended data exists have a mean @xmath38 within the apparent stellar cutoff or `` tidal '' radius that is nearly an order of magnitude larger than the core - fit central @xmath38 ( _ e.g. _ compare @xcite with @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "if we accept the cdm result that halos are similar in structure , then umajor might have a global @xmath75 .",
    "our stellar velocity measurements show that umajor is a nearly dark , low - mass halo , almost an order of magnitude less luminous than previously known dsph galaxies of similar mass .",
    "we obtain a central mass - to - light ratio @xmath76 ; if this extrapolates to larger radii like other dsphs , umajor may have a mean @xmath77 .",
    "hence , umajor may be the most dark matter dominated galaxy yet discovered . for comparison",
    ", the recently discovered @xmath78 virgohi 21 hi source has @xmath79 @xcite , and the extreme dark spiral ngc2915 has @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the cdm structure formation paradigm predicts that dark matter clumps into cusped halos characterized by a single parameter , the central density , with the smallest and least massive halos being the densest @xcite .",
    "problematically , cdm also predicts an order of magnitude more small galactic satellite halos than are actually observed ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is unclear whether the theory is at fault , or whether the missing halos are too dark to be observed .",
    "high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) have been suggested as candidates for the missing cdm dwarf halos @xcite .",
    "this suggestion remains controversial , especially as the high velocity clouds may themselves be divided into compact and diffuse subclasses with possibly different origins ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "there is no clear distance determinant for the hvcs around the milky way , and , for a long time , there was no clear consensus as to whether the hvcs were galactic or extra - galactic .",
    "this ambiguity may have been resolved by the detection of a faint circumgalactic hvc population around the andromeda galaxy by @xcite , who argue that the available data are consistent with formation mechanisms via cooling flows , or with tidal debris from mergers , or with gaseous counterparts of the missing cdm haloes .",
    "why do the dsphs have a similar velocity dispersion , a similar central density and , presumably , a similar mass , as noted by @xcite ?",
    "it is curious that draco , umi , and umajor , the three lowest luminosity galactic dsphs , all have the same dispersion , about @xmath81 , and and ix , the second faintest known dsph , has @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "is there a minimum halo size in which stars can form , or a minimum clustering scale for the dark matter ?",
    "there was no survivability reason why umajor could not have been much less massive .",
    "for instance , the mass required to bind a @xmath83 dwarf halo against tidal disruption by a @xmath84 galaxy at umajor s distance of @xmath85 is estimated by equating the dwarf and galactic densities , so that @xmath86 , or about two orders of magnitude less massive than umajor s central region , and perhaps three orders of magnitude less massive than its global mass .",
    "@xcite have compiled scaling relations among dwarf galaxies and more massive ellipticals , relating @xmath87 , @xmath55 , @xmath88 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we can locate umajor in this ensemble , using the values @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , where @xmath43 has been converted to @xmath93 band using the typical @xmath94 color of a k - giant . from figures 2 and 4 of kormendy & freeman ( 2004 ) , we find , unsurprisingly , that umajor is typical of the dsphs in all respects but luminosity .",
    "all but two of the previously known dsphs and dirrs fall onto a tight faber - jackson relation between velocity dispersion and luminosity , albeit with a systematic offset relative to larger ellipticals .",
    "umi and draco are the exceptions , being about three magnitudes under - luminous for their mass . to agree with the general trend",
    ", umajor would need to have a dispersion of @xmath95 , or would have to be about five magnitudes brighter .",
    "it has been suggested that the dsphs extreme @xmath38 results from the expulsion of baryons from their shallow potential well by supernovae @xcite , because the potential wells of the dsphs seem comparable , umajor must have been intrinsically baryon poor to begin with , or else the baryon expulsion efficiency must have varied by one or two orders of magnitude among dsphs in order to produce their very different luminosities .",
    "umajor demonstrates that the luminosity scatter at the low mass end of the galaxy distribution is very large .",
    "it appears likely that more dark and massive dwarfs are lurking in the vicinity of the galaxy .",
    "detections of more candidate objects are urgently needed to check whether the number and properties of the population are truly consistent with the missing dark matter haloes of the simulations .",
    "the data presented herein were obtained at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory , which is operated as a scientific partnership among the california institute of technology , the university of california and the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "the observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the w.m .",
