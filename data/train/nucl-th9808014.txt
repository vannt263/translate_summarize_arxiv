    "we close with a discussion of the implications of our results for recent conjectures about a direct @xmath19 coupling  @xcite ; _ ie . _ a decay not based on @xmath20 , which is a @xmath21 parity - violating @xmath9 transition .",
    "the effective @xmath9 hamiltonian density @xmath7 in ( 1 ) was originally thought  @xcite to be composed of a coleman - glashow ( cg ) nonphotonic contact tadpole part ( now couched in the language of the @xmath22 current quark mass matrix @xmath23 ) along with a photonic part @xmath24 involving intermediate photon exchange .",
    "this cg tadpole mechanism  @xcite @xmath25 with a _",

    "a similar vmd prediction for @xmath102 is also quite good : the vmd amplitude is @xmath103 using @xmath34 found from ( 4a ) , while data implies @xmath104 as extracted from the pdg tables in  @xcite .    given this justification of vmd in equs .",

    "we return to ( [ eqno11 ] ) and note that the @xmath105 coupling in ( [ eqno11 ] ) is divided by 2 ( as it was in ( [ eqno13a ] ) ) when applying vmd to the identical photon transition : @xmath106 since both @xmath107 and @xmath108 are weighted by the covariant form @xmath109 which squares up to @xmath110 , the desired amplitude @xmath111 has the same ( gev)@xmath112 mass dimension as does @xmath113 .",
    "the latter is given as @xmath114 for the @xmath115 mixing angle @xmath116 in the @xmath117 quark basis  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the theoretical branching ratio rates become with vmd  @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 mev , @xmath120 mev , so that @xmath121 .",
    "the factor of @xmath122 in ( [ eqno16 ] ) corresponds to feynman s rule of @xmath123 for two identical final - state photons , times the numerator factor of @xmath124 in ( [ eqno16 ] ) coming from the square of the covariant factor @xmath125 ( times @xmath126 which is absorbed into the definition of @xmath127 ) .",
    "finally a factor of 4 in the numerator of the right hand side of ( [ eqno16 ] ) is due to the square of the vmd relation ( [ eqno14 ] ) .    substituting the observed @xmath128 from ( [ eqno12 ] ) back into the theoretical ratio ( [ eqno16 ] ) and converting to the @xmath129 basis using ( [ eqno15 ] ) then leads to the amplitude ratio    @xmath130    a result which stems only from observed properties of the @xmath5 meson and vmd .",
    "if one goes further and identifies the transition @xmath131 as the coleman - glashow tadpole , the vmd - phenomenological estimate of unity for the ratio ( [ eqno17a ] ) requires the tadpole ratio in ( [ eqno11 ] ) and in figs .",

    "implicit in this identification is the conventional @xmath133 assignment of the @xmath5 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the tadpole mechanism fails to predict the experimental @xmath134 if the @xmath5 is considered to be a @xmath135 state .",
    "recent @xmath64-matrix analyses of meson partial waves from a variety of three - meson final states obtained from @xmath136 and @xmath137 reactions show rather convincingly that both the @xmath80 @xmath83 and @xmath138 @xmath139 mesons are formed from the bare states which are members of the lowest @xmath133 nonet  @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical developments supporting the assignment of the @xmath5 to the scalar meson @xmath133 nonet are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the modern identification of the tadpole scale with the mass difference of the up and down current quarks : @xmath140 suggests a parallel treatment of the hadronic and two - photon couplings of the @xmath5 based on the three point function method in qcd sum rules .",
    "one begins with vmd to express another measured ratio @xmath141 in terms of the strong coupling constants @xmath142 and @xmath143 . the latter coupling constant ratio",
    "is then estimated with the aid of qcd sum rules which bring in the up and down current quark masses .",
    "the result is again a reasonable value for @xmath134 and the ratio @xmath128 of ( [ eqno12 ] ) .",
    "this qcd sum rule treatment of the @xmath5 decays is consistent with , but does not really give new information about the coleman - glashow tadpole .",
    "so we do not describe it further and refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for a detailed account of this qcd sum rule program .",
    "in section 3 , vector meson dominance was used to link measured decays of the @xmath4 scalar meson @xmath5 to the universality of @xmath9 meson transitions @xmath17 and @xmath144 recently established  @xcite .",
    "one element of this universality is the value of the effective @xmath6 @xmath10 transition found  @xcite from the observed  @xcite isospin violating ( @xmath9 ) decay @xmath3 . to obtain this value ,",
    "the decay is analyzed as @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been asserted  @xcite that a direct @xmath41 coupling is not only necessary on general principles , but that a significant coupling is supported by a theoretical qcd sum rule analysis of a isospin - breaking correlator of vector currents .",
    "this assertion has prompted reanalyses of the data on @xmath145  @xcite , and the modeling of this putative contact @xmath41 term in two quark based models of @xmath146 mixing  @xcite .",
    "the results of these three investigations are somewhat mixed . here",
    "they are given as the ratio @xmath147 , where @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the basis states of pure isospin @xmath138 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the data analysis of ref.@xcite suggests @xmath150 , the coupled dyson - schwinger equations approach  @xcite finds a value five times smaller ( @xmath151 ) , and the generalized nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite predicts a value which is a further factor of four smaller ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "the last very small ratio would make direct @xmath42 decay a relatively unimportant contribution to the calculation of @xmath146 mixing from the data . on the other hand , the isospin breaking from direct @xmath42 decay suggested by the data analysis @xcite",
    "is a huge 10% rather than the few percent usually found for isospin breaking ( cf .",
    "the 2% coleman - glashow ratio reviewed in the appendix of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this in turn drives the value of @xmath17 up to @xmath153 mev@xmath78 , rather far from the value of @xmath154 mev@xmath78 ( quoted in eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) obtained from the same data when this putative contact term is ignored .",
    "it is the latter value which was shown in sections 2 and 3 to be consistent with the universality discussed there .",
    "the most recent extraction of a @xmath146 mixing parameter from the data eschews such a separation into a contact @xmath3 and mixing @xmath20 term on the grounds that it is model dependent  @xcite .",
    "as we have seen , a significant contact g - parity violating @xmath155 coupling would increase in magnitude the value of @xmath17 to such an extent that it would not be consistent with the off - diagonal @xmath77 tadpole scales ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , nor with the diagonal tadpole scales in ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , nor with the diagonal tadpole scales obtained from the baryon mass differences  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a large value of @xmath17 is not consistent with the @xmath16 universal tadpole scale obtained in ( 17 ) with the aid of the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model . in view of the inconsistency with the global coleman - glashow picture and the limited support from quark based models  @xcite for a contact @xmath155 which violates g - parity , it is instructive to look at the analogue four - point contact term in the _ strong _ decay @xmath156 .",
    "this term was introduced on general grounds some time after the suggestion  @xcite that @xmath157 will dominate the @xmath156 transition .",
    "this dominance of this vmd @xmath158 pole diagram model has been confirmed by the experimental study of the @xmath159 reaction  @xcite .",
    "in fact , a contact term large enough to satisfy a low - energy theorem  @xcite in the pseudoscalar sector(the avv anomaly ) spoils agreement with this data .",
    "the history of the fate of the contact @xmath156 term can be traced in ref .",
    "@xcite , which concludes that  nowadays the existence and magnitude of the contact term can be extracted neither from theory , nor experiment . \"",
    "we suggest that a similar fate may be store for the proposed g - parity violating @xmath41 contact term .",
    "while its effects can not be cleanly isolated from data  @xcite , in contrast to the proposed strong interaction @xmath156 contact term , nevertheless the introduction of this g - parity violating @xmath41 contact term is inconsistent with the @xmath55 prediction ( 7 ) , the universal cg tadpole scale  @xcite , and , as shown in section 3 , the measured decay properties of the @xmath5 meson .",
