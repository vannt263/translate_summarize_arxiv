    "the adsorption of halides on noble metals provides important model systems for studying adsorption on metal surfaces , particularly when there are ordered adsorbate structures . for this reason",
    ", these adsorption processes have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "adsorption of bromine and chlorine on metal has been the subject of many studies over the years .",
    "the systems we study here are br and cl chemisorbed on single - crystal ag(100 ) .",
    "experimentally , kleinherbers @xmath0  @xcite have found that the adsorption of br , cl , and i on ag(100 ) surfaces in vacuum all resulted in the formation of a @xmath1 overlayer with the adsorbates in the fourfold hollow sites .",
    "this implies a very strong , short - range repulsion , which we model as a nearest - neighbor exclusion @xcite .",
    "the bonding of the adsorbates to the substrate and the surface electronic structures have been studied by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "it is found that the bond between br or cl and the substrate is covalent with a polarization due to electron transfer from the substrate to the adsorbate  @xcite .",
    "the polarization results in dipole moments on the surface , which cause long - range dipole - dipole interactions between the adatoms .",
    "long - range dipole - dipole interactions have previously been incorporated in a lattice - gas model employed in room - temperature monte carlo simulation studies of the adsorbed system  @xcite . in these works ,",
    "the lateral interactions were extracted by fitting the results of the simulations to electrochemical adsorption isotherms . in the present study",
    "we instead estimate the lateral interactions by fitting the lattice - gas model to our dft results .",
    "we extract the next - nearest - neighbor lateral energy and the binding energy by fitting the lattice - gas model to the adsorption energies obtained from the dft calculation .",
    "the same dft calculation also yields charge distributions from which dipole - dipole interactions can be directly calculated . by comparing the two results ,",
    "we examine the significance of the long - range dipole - dipole interactions within the lattice - gas model .    in this study",
    "we present dft calculations using supercell models for the ag(100 ) surfaces .",
    "the adsorbates in these dft calculations are assumed to occupy a lattice of adsorption sites in accordance with a lattice - gas approximation  @xcite .",
    "the lattice - gas assumption of strongly located adsorbates is consistent with previous dft calculations and dynamic langevin - equation simulations for a continuum model @xcite .",
    "the adsorption energies and charge distributions were calculated by dft .",
    "we assume long - range dipole - dipole interactions between the adsorbates , and we implement these long - range interactions in the fitting of the lattice - gas model to the adsorption - energy results and the dipole moments obtained from the dft calculations .",
    "estimates of short - range lattice - gas interactions from dft calculations of adsorption energies have also recently been performed for homoepitaxy @xcite and heteroepitaxy @xcite systems .",
    "however , these studies do not consider charge transfer and long - range interactions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the details of the dft calculations and the methods used to analyze the results , section 3 discusses the calculation of the dipole moment , section 4 discusses the lattice - gas model , section 5 presents the lattice - gas fitting , and section 6 contains a discussion .",
    "we applied dft to obtain the ground - state energies and electron density functions for the adsorption of br or cl on a slab representing a ag(100 ) surface .",
    "we prepared slabs with seven metal layers .",
    "convergence checks with respect to the number of layers are discussed in appendix a. the slab was placed inside a supercell with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "two different sizes of supercells were examined . a @xmath2 supercell with the size of @xmath3 , and a @xmath4 supercell with the size of @xmath5 . here ,",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lattice constant of bulk ag , which we obtained from dft calculations by minimization of an ag fcc structure .",
    "the @xmath2 supercell contained four surface ag atoms on each side of the slab ( 28 ag atoms in total ) , while the @xmath4 supercell contained nine surface ag atoms on each side ( 63 ag atoms in total ) .",
    "the orientation of the surface normal defines the @xmath8 direction . to maximize the symmetry",
    ", we distributed the adsorbates on both sides of the slab .",
    "one , two , and three bromine or chlorine atoms were placed on each @xmath4 surface to represent coverages @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "two bromine or chlorine atoms were placed on each @xmath2 surface to represent @xmath12 and one to represent @xmath13 . here the coverage @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 when the site is occupied by the adsorbate , and @xmath17 otherwise . in other words , the coverage is the number of adsorbates divided by the total number of all possible adsorption sites , @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ super ] shows the cross section of a supercell and surface distributions of the adsorbate for various coverages . due to the nearest - neighbor exclusion and the periodic boundary conditions the adsorbates",
    "can only be placed in diagonal positions , limiting @xmath19 to less than or equal to @xmath20 .",
    "the calculations were performed by the dft method using the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite .",
    "the basis set was plane - wave , with the generalized gradient - corrected exchange - correlation functional  @xcite , vanderbilt pseudopotentials  @xcite , and a cut - off energy of 400 ev .",
    "the @xmath21-point mesh was generated using the monkhorst  method  @xcite with a @xmath22 grid for the @xmath2 supercells and a @xmath23 grid for the @xmath4 supercells .",
    "to get to the configuration with minimum energy , we used a selective dynamics method , by which the ions in the top and bottom layers were allowed to relax in the @xmath8 direction only , as opposed to the full dynamics in which the atoms would be allowed to move in all directions .",
    "this is the first step to avoid surface reconstruction , which is not expected to occur in this system under electrochemical conditions .",
    "the second step is to average the @xmath8 coordinates of the top and bottom layers .",
    "the dft results yield total energies and electron densities , @xmath24 .",
    "we next ran static minimization on the resulting averaged minimum - energy structure . here , ` static ' means running energy minimization on the electron distribution without changing the positions of the nuclei . from this run",
    ", we obtained the total energy of the system , @xmath25 .",
    "we then took the same structure and removed the adsorbate to obtain the clean - slab structure .",
    "again , we ran selective dynamics on this slab structure to obtain @xmath26 . to get the energy of an isolated halide atom",
    ", we also ran static minimization on an isolated halide atom to obtain @xmath27 .",
    "we define the adsorption energy per supercell per site as    @xmath28    here , @xmath18 is the number of sites on one surface of the metal slab , and @xmath29 is the number of halides on each side of the slab . in fig .",
    "[ adse ] we show @xmath30 as a function of @xmath19 for both systems .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath30 contains the lateral interaction energy and is different from the single - particle binding energy @xmath31 .",
    "the relation between these two quantities is given explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eads ] ) below .    to understand the surface polarization we need to study the charge - transfer behavior .",
    "we define the negative of the electron densities from the dft output as the charge density distributions @xmath32 , and we introduce the charge transfer function per adsorbed atom , which is defined as follows  @xcite    @xmath33/n , \\label{surface_dip0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the full charge density of the adlayer system with @xmath29 adsorbed br or cl on each side of the slab , and @xmath35 is the full charge density of the pair of isolated halide atoms at the same positions as in the halide - ag bonded system , and @xmath36 is the charge density of the ag(100 ) slab with all atoms at the same positions as in the halide - ag bonded system  @xcite . after integrating over @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "this yields the charge transfer function per pair of adsorbed atoms ,    @xmath39    from the charge transfer function integrated over the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions , @xmath40 , we can calculate the surface dipole moment as @xmath41 here @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the height of the supercell .",
    "the zero point of the coordinate is placed at the middle of the supercell .",
    "figure  [ dipm ] shows the results of the dipole moment calculation for bromine and chlorine .",
    "here we observe that the magnitude of the dipole moment decreases approximately linearly with @xmath19 .",
    "the surface dipole moment of the energy - minimized clean slab was also calculated and verified to be the same as the surface dipole moment of the slab with all atoms at the same positions as in the halide - ag bonded system , thus justifying our procedure .",
    "figure  [ layers ] shows the charge transfer function @xmath40 for br / ag(100 ) with @xmath44 . in this figure",
    "positive values indicate electrons being removed , while negative values indicate electrons being added . from the figure we see that charge is mostly transferred from the surface silver atoms to the adsorbates . inside the bulk",
    ", the charge transfer function indicates only minor charge redistribution above and below each of the silver layers .",
    "since the charge transfer function is calculated by subtracting the charge distributions of the clean slab and isolated adsorbate from that of the adsorbed system , we conclude that this small charge redistribution is caused by the adsorption processes .",
    "figure  [ allcov ] shows the charge transfer function per adsorbed atom @xmath45 for br / ag(100 ) and cl / ag(100 ) for all coverages .",
    "here we only show half of the supercell since the charge transfer function is symmetric in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "both systems show a similarity in that the magnitude and distribution of the charge transfer from the ag surface are independent of the coverage . however , fig .",
    "[ allcov ] also shows that while the magnitude of the charge transfer from the surface to the adsorbate is independent of the coverage , the resulting charge distribution around the adsorbate is not . indeed , higher coverage results in a more asymmetrical charge distribution around the adsorbate .",
    "this asymmetry is more pronounced in the br / ag(100 ) case , suggesting an important difference between br / ag(100 ) and cl / ag(100 ) .",
    "figure  [ brcl ] , which shows the charge transfer function for low and high coverages , illustrates the difference more clearly . here",
    "we see that there is no significant difference between br / ag(100 ) and cl / ag(100 ) for @xmath44 , while for @xmath12 we see a quite significant difference .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that once we have obtained the charge transfer function , we can calculate the dipole moment @xmath46 from eq .",
    "( [ surface_dip ] ) . kohn and",
    "lau  @xcite showed that the non - oscillatory part of the dipole - dipole interaction energy between the adatoms behaves as @xmath47    the novel aspect of this expression is the factor of 2 . a qualitative explanation for this factor is given in appendix b. for a more detailed and general treatment we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite . with eq .",
    "( [ dip_dip ] ) , we can calculate @xmath48 from the surface dipole moment results from the dft as described in eq .",
    "( [ surface_dip ] ) as @xmath49 for large @xmath50 ( in our case larger than the nearest - neighbor distance ) .",
    "here @xmath46 is the surface dipole moment calculated from the charge transfer function ( eq .  ( [ surface_dip ] ) ) , and @xmath51 is the lateral distance between a pair of next - nearest neighbor adatoms .",
    "we use an @xmath52 square array of @xmath53 adsorption sites .",
    "each site corresponds to a four - fold hollow site on the ag(100 ) surface .",
    "the energy of this lattice - gas model is    @xmath54    here @xmath55 and @xmath56 denote adsorption sites , @xmath57 is the lateral interaction energy of the pair ( @xmath58 ) , and @xmath59 is the single - particle binding energy .",
    "the sign convention is that @xmath60 signifies repulsive interaction and @xmath61 favors adsorption  @xcite .",
    "@xmath62 is a sum over all pairs of sites , and @xmath18 is the number of four - fold hollow sites on each side of the slab .",
    "for simplicity we ignore multiparticle interactions @xcite .",
    "koper  @xcite has shown that the effects of screening and finite nearest - neighbor repulsion are very small .",
    "following his results , we use a lattice - gas model with nearest - neighbor exclusion and unscreened dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the distances used in the lattice - gas model are @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the distance between a pair of adsorbates @xmath58 , and @xmath66 is the ag(100 ) lattice spacing .",
    "we can then write @xmath67    thus we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 the adsorption energy defined in eq .",
    "( [ eads1 ] ) is related to the lattice - gas energy of eq .",
    "( [ lg1 ] ) as @xmath70 this enables us to break down @xmath30 into its lateral - interaction and single - atom binding parts as follows , @xmath71 where @xmath19 is the coverage ( eq .",

    "we can calculate this energy by extending the supercell to infinity in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions by means of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the central supercell is the original supercell , and the image supercells are the supercell extensions in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 directions .",
    "the lateral energy per supercell is the sum of the interaction energies of pairs in the central supercell and the lateral energies of pairs of adsorbates in the central supercell and adsorbates in the image supercells .",
