    "bloch - kato pro-@xmath0 groups were introduced in @xcite and studied first in @xcite .",
    "a bloch - kato pro-@xmath0 group is a pro-@xmath0 group which satisfies the conclusion of the rost - voevodsky theorem ( formerly known as the bloch - kato conjecture ) , i.e. , such that the cohomology ring of every closed subgroup of @xmath1 with coefficients in the finite field @xmath23 is a quadratic algebra over @xmath23 .",
    "for example , absolute galois groups of fields which are pro-@xmath0 and galois groups of the maximal @xmath0-extension of certain fields are bloch - kato pro-@xmath0 groups .",
    "thus , a bloch - kato pro-@xmath0 group is a very natural `` candidate '' for being realized as absolute galois group , and this shows the relevance of bloch - kato pro-@xmath0 groups for galois theory .",
    "the problem to characterize a field @xmath4 yielding the equality @xmath24 arises rather naturally , and the case when equality ( [ eq : equality fields ] ) holds is considered very significant in field theory .",
    "indeed , such problem has been widely studied in the past : in the case @xmath22 corollary  b was proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) , with arguments which make use of galois cohomology , and later in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  a ) , with arguments relying on the theory of quadratic forms . for @xmath0 odd",
    ", corollary  b was proved in ( * ? ? ? * theorem  a ) , and the proof relies on certain properties of bloch - kato pro-@xmath0 groups , together with an essential arithmetic argument ( cf .",
    "* theorem  4.3 ) ) .",
    "the above results provide a motivation for the paper , as theorem  a is the `` group - theoretic translation '' , and it is in fact more genaral , as it holds for bloch - kato pro-@xmath0 groups , and not only for galois groups of maximal @xmath0-extensions .",
    "moreover , part of the interest of this result lies in the fact that the proof is purely group - theoretical , and it does not rely on results form field theory .",
    "further , the proof makes use of the zassenhaus filtration of pro-@xmath0 groups , which is gaining increasing importance as tool for the study of galois groups ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section , we state a number of properties on pro-@xmath0 groups and on their descending series . in section",
    "3 we prove theorem  a , and in section  4 we provide the `` arithmetic translation '' of theorem  a , and we prove corollary  b.    this paper will be published on the _ annales mathmatiques du qubec_.",
    "throughout this paper , subgroups of pro-@xmath0 groups are assumed to be closed ( in the pro-@xmath0 topology ) , and every generator is to be intended as topological generator . in particular , given two ( closed ) subgroups @xmath25 and @xmath26 of a pro-@xmath0 group @xmath1 , the subgroup @xmath27 $ ] is the ( closed ) subgroup of @xmath1 generated by the commutators @xmath28 $ ] , with @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
