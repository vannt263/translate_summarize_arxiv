    "use of clusters of galaxies in cosmological studies , requires a relation between the observed properties of the systems , such as x - ray luminosity , icm temperature and the total mass of the system . understanding this relation and its evolution with the redshift is therefore one of the key research focuses of modern astrophysics ( e.g. majumdar & mohr 2004 ) .",
    "early observations have already demonstrated the importance of processes related to the physics of baryons in defining the observational appearance of clusters , and in particular on their low - mass end  groups of galaxies ( e.g. ponman et al .",
    "currently , theoretical interpretation of the observed properties of groups and clusters of galaxies involves an interplay between the cooling and resulting star - formation and feedback ( borgani et al .",

    "2003 ; voit et al .",
    "2003 ; kay et al .",
    "the complexity of the feedback schemes and variations in the feedback efficiency , given by imf as well as agn activity ( e.g. springel & hernquist 2003 ) , points to the importance of observations .",
    "in particular , observations of the cores of groups and clusters of galaxies are critical to understand the effects of cooling ( voit et al .",
    "finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) demonstrated that outskirts of groups and cool clusters also deviate from the expectations of gravitational heating , and can not be explained by the effects of cooling .",
    "the challenging energetics of the observed effect , requires a very efficient feedback scheme , and the currently favoured mechanism invokes amplification of the entropy of the accreting gas by the shock heating ",
    "so called `` smooth accretion '' ( ponman et al . 2003 ; voit et al . 2003 ; voit & ponman 2003 ; borgani et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the large grasp of xmm - newton provides us with new possibilities to test scenarios of group formation  in particular , the link between the state of the gas and the structure in x - ray images .",
    "our idea here is quite straight - forward ; since mergers are examples of lumpy accretion , post - merger groups should have on average lower entropy , compared to systems where the bulk of the material has been added through slow accretion .",
    "thus , using two dimensional analysis of xmm - newton data , combined with standard analysis using annuli , with limiting radii increasing logarithmically , we can both infer the state of the gas with unprecedented precision and provide an explanation of the observed trend by studying substructure .",
    "we also examine the dynamic state of the galaxies in these groups , to provide independent evidence .    at the moment",
    "there is no large purely x - ray selected sample of local groups of galaxies .",
    "for example , only a few objects , fornax cluster , mkw4 , ngc4636 , ngc1550 and ngc5044 are present in the hiflugs , a complete all - sky sample of brightest groups and clusters of galaxies ( reiprich & bhringer 2002 ) .",
    "most present - day samples of groups are based on the x - ray follow - up of the optical surveys ( e.g. mahdavi et al .",
    "2000 ; mulchaey et al .",
    "2003 ) . for this study",
    "we have primarily selected the groups primarily from mulchaey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) with publicly available xmm - newton ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) observations .",
    "mulchaey list is based on the cross - correlating the rosat observation log with the positions of optically - selected groups in the catalogs of huchra & geller ( 1982 ) , geller & huchra ( 1983 ) , maia et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , nolthenius ( 1993 ) and garcia ( 1993 ) .",
    "while these catalogs also include richer galaxy systems ( i.e. clusters ) , the mulchaey list only includes systems with velocity dispersions less than 600 km / s or an intragroup medium temperature less than 2 kev .",
    "a total of 25 systems observed by xmm - newton have been selected , and further divided onto two samples covering the redshift ranges 0.0040.012 and 0.0120.024 .",
    "the low - redshift sample is discussed in finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , while here we concentrate on the high redshift sample .",
    "although our sample is not statistically complete , it has been shown by finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that both xmm - newton follow - up and the selection of the groups by mulchaey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) appear representative .",
    "we further increase our @xmath20.0120.024 sample by addition of two groups , hcg51 and pavo , which were not in mulchaey s sample ( there has been no rosat pspc observations of those two groups ) , but lie in the same redshift range .    an important difference between our ` low ' and ` high ' redshift",
    "subsamples consists in the different coverage of the group emission . while in the low - redshift sample",
    ", we concentrate on the properties of the central brightest group galaxies ( bggs ) , with the high - redshift sample typical scales resolved correspond to the transition zone between the bgg and the group .",
    "as the mulchaey list is flux - limited , the typical luminosity of the high - redshift subsample is @xmath3 ergs s@xmath4 , i.e. we look at bona fide groups , where the total x - ray flux is dominated by the group emission , while the origin of the hot gas is a specific aspect of the low - z subsample . in present sample",
    ", we have , however , included a few examples ( e.g. hcg92 ) , where strong galaxy interactions result in the high x - ray luminosity .",
    "the present paper ( paper i ) presents an analysis of the radial and 2-dimensional structure of the hot gas properties for the sample .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : ",
    "[ s : data ] describes the analysis of the xmm - newton observations ;  [ s : results ] outlines the average properties of the sample and dispersion around the mean trends ;  [ s : ind ] describes each group of the sample individually ;  [ s : sum ] concludes the paper .",
    "paper ii ( osmond et al .",
    "2006 ) is concerned with classifying the groups , on the basis of their gas properties , and looking at the relationship between different properties .",
    "finally , a study of temperature and element abundance profiles using the chandra observations of 15 groups with 6 overlapping with the current sample are reported in rasmussen et al .",
    "it turns out that the chandra sample is dominated by the cool core systems , which results in some differences in the reported mean trends .",
    "however for systems in common the results agree well .",
    "tab.[t : ol ] details the observations , listing the name of the group ( column 1 ) , the assigned xmm archival name ( 2 ) , net epic - pn exposure after removal of flaring episodes ( 3 ) , pn filter used ( 4 ) , needed for instrumental response as well as background estimates , xmm - newton revolution number ( 5 ) , useful assessment to the secular evolution of the instrumental background , pn frame time ( 6 ) , which determines the fraction of out - of - time events .",
    ".log of the xmm epic - pn observations of groups .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     a remarkably high dispersion of points around the mean pressure trend is reported in fig.[f : c2s ] .",
    "a similar analysis has been carried out using a catalogue of 68 preheated clusters evolved with p3msph ( evrard 1988 ) , with the details of the analysis presented in finoguenov et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    ". the high dispersion in pressure could be formulated as a high fraction of the sample with rms exceeding a 30% value ( 42% vs 22% in the simulations ) and also having 20% of the sample exhibiting a fractional rms exceeding 60% , when only 5% are expected .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test returns the likelihood of the two samples being drawn from the same distribution of 1% . at the same time",
    "the likelihood that the rms in the entropy have a similar origin is 97% .",
    "a similar comparison for a representative cluster sample has been performed in finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , where no deviations between the simulated and observed clusters were found , even though the data analysis technique was exactly the same as that used here , and the statistics of the observations were comparable to the current sample . noting that the simulations used for comparison here were simulations of _ clusters _ , rather than groups , it appears that the excess dispersion seen in the pressure in fig.[f : c2s ] is really a difference between groups and clusters , rather than one between simulations and observations .",
    "the good agreement seen in the entropy , disfavours any interpretation of the large scatter seen in groups in terms of differences in the thermodynamic history of the gas .",
    "we suggest that the differences really lie in the dark matter substructure , and should be further investigated in simulations .",
    "we note that in mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , a similar conclusion has been derived for some other groups individually , so we think that our result is representative .",
    "this result is somewhat surprising , given that the cdm scenario predicts little dependence of the subhalo mass function on the mass of the host .",
    "a comparison with the data on the lowest mass scale , probed by observations of the nearby galaxies , reveals an opposite problem , as too few dwarf galaxies are found ( e.g. klypin et al . 1999 ) .",
    "while a number of baryonic effects could be used to cure the problem on dwarf regime , these observations may shed light on the nature of the dark matter . here",
    "we discuss a possible explanation within the framework of the conventional @xmath5 model .",
    "in general , at an enhanced level of the entropy of the gas , typical of galaxy groups , one expects to diminish the effects of substructure ( e.g. kay et al .",
    "2004 ) , unless it retains its own gas .",
    "we stress once again , that difference in the average trend , also examined in fig.[f : c2s ] using the annuli , can not account for the observed two - dimensional scatter . in our case , the most deviant points on the maps could often be associated with the location of major galaxies , yet the effect is not sufficient to disturb the entropy distribution .",
    "as at the moment we do not have simulations of groups to compare with , we postpone resolving this issue to the future work .",
    "another potentially important effect arises from the narrow redshift range of the groups in our sample .",
    "there is a known difference in the abundance of groups between the northern and southern hemispheres , associated with the presence of a large scale structure at @xmath6 ( boehringer et al .",
    "thus , further x - ray observations of a more distant group sample , such as available from the rosat 400 square degree survey ( burenin et al .",
    "2006 ) , are needed to study the influence of lss on these conclusions .",
    "if , as suggested above , our group sample exhibits the presence of substructure in the dark matter , evidence of this might also be apparent in the velocity histograms of galaxies . to explore this ,",
    "we collect them together in this section , although most of these histograms have been already published elsewhere ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 ) .",
    "fig.[f : opt ] displays the velocity histograms of the sample , using a bin size of 200 km / s and including galaxies within the 1.2 mpc of the group centre . a typical error on estimating the velocity is around 80150 km / s .",
    "evidence for substructure is present for 3c449 , ngc5171 , ngc507 and hcg15 , although its exact quantification is difficult in most cases , due to the poor statistics .",
    "ngc4073 , ngc2563 , ngc533 and hcg62 appear to be regular groups .",
    "some hints of substructure seen in the hcg62 histogram have been robustly identified through a refined method by zabludoff and mulchaey ( 1998 ) .",
    "the available quality of the data is not sufficient for characterizing the degree of substructure to better than 20% , and a dedicated follow - up program is underway , the results of which will be reported elsewhere ( zimer et al . in prep . ) . with the currently available data ,",
    "the conclusion is that , while in some cases ( discussed in section 4 below ) a detection of substructure provides supporting evidence of a link between the observed properties of the gas and the underlying dark matter distribution , it is not possible to derive quantitative conclusions without a much larger spectroscopic database on group members .",
    "typically , a minimum of 100 group members with redshift measurements is required for such a study .",
    "the brightest group member is always an elliptical , except for hcg92 , where it is a lenticular .",
    "however , a complex galaxy ( e.g. a double galaxy ) in the centre is present for hcg 68 , hcg 92 , ngc 4073 , pavo , 3c449 , hcg 51 , ngc 507 , hcg 62 .",
    "pavo , hcg51 , ngc4073 contain more than one spiral galaxy .",
    "we will follow a similar scheme when presenting the results for every system . as described in captions to fig.[r:3c449 ] , from top to bottom , left panels show the profiles of entropy , pressure , temperature and fe abundance .",
    "the results obtained using annuli are shown in grey .",
    "the results from two - dimensional analysis ( black crosses ) are both shown as maps in the central panels and are converted into the profiles by plotting the observed values vs the distance of the extraction area from the centre .",
    "the dashed line in the entropy panel shows @xmath7 , expected from simulations , normalized to the universal entropy scaling relation of ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . the non - parametric model for entropy and pressure are plotted as dashed line in the corresponding panels .",
    "entropy and pressure maps are displayed as their ratios to the non - parametric model . from top to bottom , right panels show the results of image analysis : entropy , pressure , temperature maps , and surface brightness in the 0.5 - 2 kev band , where the temperature has been estimated through the hardness ratio of the 0.51 and 12 kev bands .",
    "coordinates on the images are in units of @xmath8 .",
    "the iron abundance is given in the photospheric solar units of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "within the scenario of smoothness of accretion ( e.g. voit et al .",
    "2003 ; borgani et al . 2005 ) , lumpy accretion should lead to lower entropy in group outskirts . at the same time , this would produce a large degree of variance in the central regions . while this is true for 3c449 , a subsample of systems with lower entropy at outskirts , which includes 3c449 , pavo , ngc5171 , ngc4073 , ngc533 , ngc4325 and hcg62 , does not encompass all deviant systems .",
    "some systems with high entropy at outskirts , such as hcg51 , hcg42 , have large degree of substructure .",
    "in addition , the flat temperature profile of hcg51 and hcg42 is a rather striking feature , possibly suggesting a major merger .",
    "thus , while mergers seem to account for all systems of high dispersion , they either result in flat temperature profiles or in flat entropy profiles , probably depending on the mass ratio of the merger .",
    "the low entropy at outskirts of some of the groups may indicate an infall of the gas which corresponds to the early stage of a merger .",
    "we associate flat temperature profiles with the late stages of mergers .",

    "the surface brightness reveals a number of asymmetries , which we were not able to resolve spectroscopically . the observed picture suggests incomplete mixing after a recent merger .",
    "hcg 51 is also a very dense system in the optical . on the entropy profile",
    ", the system reveals quite a high entropy level in its outskirts .",
    "the overall pressure level is low , suggesting that the scaling temperature has been boosted by 10% .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the igm in a representative sample of groups of galaxies observed by xmm - newton , which has been primarily drawn from the sample of mulchaey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . comparing the entropy and pressure profiles of these groups with typical cluster profiles , scaled using the prescription of ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we perform a non - parametric orthogonal regression analysis and obtain the typical entropy and pressure profile of the sample . in comparison to the commonly adopted @xmath22 behaviour for the entropy ,",
    "the averaged profile for the groups is flatter , @xmath23 , which is due to two effects : feedback in the group centres and the influence of infall in the outskirts .",
    "the averaged pressure profile has a slope of @xmath24 within @xmath10 , and gradually steepens , reaching a slope of @xmath25 , which at the same radii is still shallower compared to the value of @xmath26 reported in the similar analysis of clusters of galaxies ( finoguenov et al . 2005 ) , and the overall mean pressure profile is well described by a srsic law with @xmath1 .    the analysis using annuli may result in a somewhat steeper entropy profiles , compared to the results reported here . as discussed in xu et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , a two - temperature model accounting for mixing of components with different entropy , assuming they are in the pressure equilibrium , also results in a flatter entropy profile .",
    "so , it might be that a two - dimensional modelling starts to resolve those components and reveals on average higher entropy at the center , just like the two - temperature approach .",
    "there are however , several pitfalls here .",
    "one is that we can not verify this by performing a two - temperature fit , as the binning of the regions would suffer from high requirements on the statistics of the spectra imposed by a two temperature model . on the other hand an assumption of pressure equilibrium",
    "is not often justified , as shock wave driven by agn are often observed as in e.g. m87 ( forman et al .",
    "2005 ) and the perseus cluster ( fabian et al . 2005 ) .",
    "an abundance of substructure has been identified in the sample , most of which we associate with the debris of recent mergers , usually seen as incomplete gas mixing . we also identify cases where the gas simply traces the dark matter substructure . in most cases",
    "we see also anisotropy in the velocity distribution of the galaxies , though our statistics are generally poor .",
    "our two - dimensional study yields high dispersion values for the pressure , compared to numerical simulations , which describe well the trends observed in clusters of galaxies . on the other hand , the scatter in the entropy is found to be as predicted in the simulations and is similar to that in clusters .",
    "this could either mean that the subhalo mass function in groups is different to that of the clusters , or that the substructure is better seen over the fainter mean trends typical of groups .",
    "we also mention that the sample selection correspond to a single large scale structure and studies covering larger redshift depth are required to firmly establish our findings .",
    "we find that the state of the igm resulting from galaxy merging , as observed in hcg  92 , resembles closely the scaled properties of luminous galaxy groups .",
    "thus , even using entropy and pressure it will be hard to identify the low - mass groups upscattered in their @xmath27 relation due to merger events , as discussed in stanek et al .",
