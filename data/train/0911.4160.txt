    "the spreading of surfactant over a thin layer of fluid is of fundamental importance to diverse biomedical applications such as pulmonary surfactant replacement therapy @xcite , lipid tear layers in our eyes @xcite , and drug delivery mechanisms @xcite , as well as many industrial coating and draining flows .",
    "the dynamics of the spreading process are driven by highly nonlinear equations modeling the curvature of the fluid s free surface and gradients in the surfactant concentration @xcite .",
    "progress in assessing the efficacy of these theoretical models , recently reviewed by craster and matar @xcite , has been hampered by the difficulty of directly visualizing the location of the surfactant in experiments @xcite .",
    "an experimentally convenient and commonly modeled geometry starts from a radially symmetric droplet of surfactant which is allowed to spread over the underlying fluid @xcite .",
    "the gradient in surfactant concentration at the leading edge of the droplet causes a gradient in surface tension . as a result ,",
    "marangoni forces pull outward on both the surfactant and the underlying fluid , causing the droplet to spread . during the spreading , a fluid ridge known as a marangoni ridge forms near the leading edge of the surfactant . in models coupling lubrication theory for a thin fluid to the surface tension gradient provided by the surfactant concentration gradient",
    ", the marangoni ridge and the peak or edge of the surfactant concentration profile have been associated with shocks or traveling wave solutions @xcite .",
    "however , few experimental measurements have been made to quantify the relationship between the surfactant concentration and the fluid surface curvature , due to the difficulty of directly measuring the spatial distribution of surfactant molecules @xcite .",
    "previous experiments have provided quantitative measurements of either the position of the surfactant leading edge or of the fluid surface profile , but not quantitative profiles of both for the same system .",
    "bull et al .",
    "@xcite measured the location of the leading edge of a spreading fluorescent surfactant on a glycerin layer , while fluorescent microspheres on the surface were used to infer the arrival of the surface disturbance .",
    "dussaud et al .",
    "@xcite , measured changes in the surface slope due to the spread of oleic acid on a glycerin - water layer via moir topography and used talc particles on the surface to infer the arrival of the leading edge of the surfactant . in both studies , it was observed that the spreading surfactant lagged behind the surface disturbance , which we are calling the marangoni ridge . in the experiments presented here , we provide simultaneous measurements of both the surface height profile and the surfactant concentration field by combining laser profilometry with further development of the fluorescence techniques introduced by @xcite .",
    "this combination of techniques allows us to directly measure the spatiotemporal evolution of a droplet of a fluorescently - tagged surfactant lipid spreading on a thin layer of glycerin without introducing additional contaminants to the system .",
    "we find that , at later times , while the forward part of the surface disturbance can be said to be in front of the leading edge of the spreading surfactant , the surfactant leading edge coincides with the peak of the marangoni ridge .",
    "we compare our experimental results with the models of jensen and grotberg @xcite which predict a @xmath4 spreading law for the peak of the marangoni ridge , similar to what was previously observed in experiments by gaver and grotberg @xcite .",
    "( note that this behavior is _ slower _ than that of droplets spreading on thick layers , for which the scaling is @xmath5 to @xmath6 , depending on the degree of surface contamination @xcite or on very thin ( @xmath7 m ) layers , for which the scaling is predicted and observed to be @xmath8 @xcite . ) in our experiments , we measure spreading exponents which approximately agree with the predicted @xmath9 values .",
    "however , the marangoni ridge initially forms behind the leading edge of the surfactant , near the maximum in surfactant concentration , and only later catches up .",
    "thus , the measured exponents are slightly higher for the position of the marangoni ridge and slightly lower for the position of the leading edge . in the work of dussaud",
    "@xcite , similar behavior was observed , namely a higher spreading exponent for the marangoni ridge than for the surfactant leading edge .",
    "however , some care needs to be taken in connecting these two results , since the ridge position in @xcite was tracked via the point of minimum surface slope rather than the peak . for a dispersive wave , as is the case here , the peak and the inflection point will become further apart over time .",
    "similarly , the fluorospheres used to visualize the surface disturbance in bull et al .",
    "@xcite will be moved by the front of the wave associated with the surface compression disturbance , even before the peak of the marangoni ridge arrives . by directly imaging both the full surface profile and the spatiotemporal evolution of the surfactant concentration",

    "this quantity corresponds to a surfactant monolayer concentration of @xmath26  @xmath27g/@xmath22 and represents an upper limit on our monolayer concentration @xmath28 because our liquid layer is not completely anhydrous . for phosphocholines in the presence of water",
    ", the cross - section would be no larger than @xmath29  @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this critical concentration @xmath30 is important because the presence of a larger amount of surfactant will not further reduce the surface tension ( i.e. , @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) .",

    "to determine the relationship between fluorescence intensities measured by the camera and surfactant concentration , we take pictures in which known quantities of nbd - pc are placed in 20 mm diameter rings under normal experimental conditions .",
    "the choice of ring size is guided by a desire to minimize errors due to heterogeneity in nbd - pc concentration , yet still provide a large enough area for measurement .",

    "brighter green corresponds to greater surfactant concentration ; the red line is a refracted laser line showing the height profile of the glycerin surface .",

    "we set @xmath57 at the middle of the interval captured by the preceding image .",
    "as time progresses , a marangoni ridge develops behind the leading edge of the surfactant and eventually catches up .",
    "note that the fluorescence concentration within the spreading front has a plateau with a @xmath58 .",

    ", @xmath56 falls off monotonically without the presence of either the plateau or the leading edge peak observed here .",
    "the distinct peak in surfactant concentration just behind the leading edge of @xmath56 is generated during the interval between the first two images ( see fig .  [ spacetime]a - b ) and might therefore be associated with the detachment of the fluid from the ring .",
    "however , in control experiments in which the confining ring is lifted from a uniform layer of surfactant no such peak is formed . because the surface slope is shallow ( @xmath59 ) in the vicinity of the peak , the increased intensity is unlikely to be due to an increased surface area arising from the tilt .",

    "these heterogeneities form during the initial deposit of the surfactant - chloroform mixture within the ring and do not dissipate due to the low surface diffusivity .",
    "the origin of the aggregation likely lies in the electrostatic attractions between the lipid molecules @xcite",
    ". no characteristic length scale has been observed , but fingering instabilities in spreading surfactant fronts have been observed for flows down inclined planes @xcite and for microscopic films @xcite .",
    "importantly , these heterogeneities likely have only a small effect on the spreading behavior since the spreading front is observed to remain circular at all times .",
    "this can be understood as arising from the fact that for @xmath32 , surface tension gradients are small .",
    "additional work is needed to characterize this aggregation phenomenon , for which the ability to directly observe the surfactant location is a key technique .    to visualize the spatial relationship between the marangoni ridge and the surfactant concentration , figure",

    "after about 6  seconds , the peak of the marangoni ridge catches up to the leading edge of the surfactant , which corresponds to the behavior observed in @xcite .",
    "the peak and leading edge move together for the remaining time we are able to track the position of the marangoni ridge peak , which becomes too flat to detect after about 20 seconds .",

    "there is considerable scatter in the initial @xmath76 , but the exponent is consistent between runs .",
    "we fit each curve to the form @xmath77 and find a mean spreading exponent of @xmath78 , represented by the slope of the dashed line .",

    "interestingly , the spreading behaviors for @xmath80 and 18  @xmath27 g are very similar , while the 36  @xmath27 g has a larger prefactor , but still the same exponent @xmath63 .",
    "it is possible that the faster rate is related to reservoir effects stemming from the additional supply of molecules , but in all cases the initial supply concentration exceeds one monolayer . for a thinner layer ( @xmath72  mm ) which better - satisfies the conditions of the lubrication approximation without being so thin as to cause surface rupture",
    ", we observe a spreading exponent closer to @xmath9 .",

    "we automatically located the leading edge by finding this peak in the intensity gradient of a smoothed profile , fitting a parabola to the peak , and taking the edge to be the position at which the parabola crosses zero .",
    "our ability to detect the edge is limited at long times by the decreasing intensity of the signal .",
    "however , we do not see a change in behavior as the system approaches the estimated @xmath83  mm radius at which the nbd - pc molecules become a monolayer .",
    "figure  [ spacetime]f supports the identification of this length scale , as the surfactant concentration profile @xmath56 has become nearly flat behind the leading edge at @xmath84  mm .",
    "three separate runs with @xmath85 g yield @xmath86 , which is slower than observed for the marangoni ridge position , and in approximate agreement with the @xmath9 scaling predicted by jensen and grotberg @xcite .",
    "the combined techniques of laser profilometry and fluorescent surfactants have allowed us to simultaneously monitor both the surface deformation of a glycerin layer and the spreading of surfactant molecules across the surface .",
    "releasing a mass of surfactant from within a confining ring allows us to compare our experimental observations with models and simulations for the spreading of an axisymmetric drop as in @xcite which predict @xmath87 .",
    "we find that the measured exponents @xmath88 and @xmath89 are both in reasonable agreement with the predicted exponent .",
    "it is important to note that the exponent @xmath9 is in fact only expected under a set of highly restrictive conditions which neglect gravity , neglect capillarity , and utilize the lubrication approximation ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "furthermore , the lifting of the ring creates a disturbance with its own length scale : it is therefore likely that no single exponent fully characterizes the spreading .",
    "as observed in the models , the peak of the marangoni ridge and the location of the surfactant leading edge coincide ( although only after an initial transient during which the ridge lags ) .",
    "in addition , the fluid profile is observed , as in @xcite , to have a capillary trough which trails the marangoni ridge .",
    "the fluorescence imaging indicates that this trough is associated with a reservoir for the spreading surfactant .",
    "interestingly , the spreading exponent @xmath63 ( measured for the peak of the marangoni ridge ) is higher than @xmath3 but @xmath91 ( obtained from fluorescence measurements of the position of the leading edge of the surfactant ) is lower .",
    "while the range of times over which we can take measurements of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are overlapping , early - time data is only available for @xmath92 and late - time data is only available for @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath54 is measured over both longer and later times than @xmath51 , @xmath91 would be expected to be closer to the asymptotic result .",
    "the higher - than - expected value of @xmath63 may simply reflect the lingering effects of the initial disturbance provided by the ring lifting and then detaching from the fluid surface .",
    "thus , its possible that an ( unobserved ) crossover to @xmath94 occurs for later times than were measured .    in addition , several other discrepancies from the idealized model @xcite might act separately on the two positions @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "capillarity and gravity do not act on the fluid and surfactant in the same way .",
    "second , while the ratio of film thickness to lateral extent is small , three - dimensional effects ( such as circulation under the free surface ) are likely still present and may affect the spreading rate of the fluid ( and to a lesser extent , the surfactant ) .",
    "indeed , gaver and grotberg @xcite calculated that there is a re - circulation of particle - trajectories within the bulk of a fluid , but it remains unclear what consequence this has on the marangoni ridge motion .",
    "further efforts to probe the validity of the lubrication approximation in this regime are necessary .    to understand the low value of @xmath91",
    ", we should consider the surfactant itself . in our initial configuration ,",
    "the confining ring contains multiple layers of surfactant .",
    "these multiple layers may act as a reservoir of surfactant and thus might provide an effective flux of surfactant .",
    "however , the predicted effect @xcite is @xmath95 for a constant flux of surfactant supplied at a rate of @xmath96 , which would necessarily lead to a larger value for @xmath91 , rather than the smaller value observed .",
    "in addition , we do not observe a change in @xmath97 even when we change the initial number of monolayers via initial surfactant mass @xmath65 .",
    "a second effect is the presence of a non - zero surface diffusivity @xcite , which is predicted to increase @xmath98 by amounts similar to the discrepancies observed here @xcite .",
    "however , this would shift @xmath99 in the opposite direction from what is observed .",
    "significantly , two key discrepancies with existing models @xcite arise in examining the shape of the surfactant concentration @xmath56 : neither the presence of a plateau behind the leading edge nor the peak immediately behind the leading edge are predicted .",
    "instead , the model @xmath56 falls off monotonically .",
    "interestingly , the plateau has a near - monolayer concentration ( @xmath58 ) . at early times",
    ", the region behind the leading edge has @xmath32 , and therefore only small surface - tension gradients would act to smooth the peak in @xmath49 .",
    "thus , there is no observable disturbance to @xmath11 due to peak in @xmath56 .",
