    "it has been shown in ref . that there is a unitary transformation that relates the @xmath0 chiral basis , usually represented as @xmath1 , where @xmath4 is the index of the chiral representation ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "@xmath6 is the quantum number of isospin , and @xmath7 indicates the total angular momentum of the state with definite parity and charge , and the @xmath8 basis , which regards the spin - orbit angular momentum coupling used in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "this allows one to write a particular state belonging to a chiral multiplet with quantum numbers @xmath7 , as a superposition of states of the nonrelativistic - inspired @xmath2 classification scheme .",
    "a chiral state with definite parity @xmath9 can be decomposed as a superposition of helicity states without definite parity @xmath10 through @xcite @xmath11 and @xmath12 are individual isospin and helicity respectively .",
    "coefficients @xmath13 relate the helicity basis to the chiral basis with definite parity in the state .",
    "they can be found in refs . .",
    "@xmath14 are the usual @xmath3 clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "two - particle helicity states @xmath15 can be written in terms of vectors in the @xmath2 basis once one knows the expression for the matrix elements @xcite @xmath16 it represents the angular momentum coupling of a two - particle state with individual helicities @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) to a system of total spin @xmath20 and and orbital angular momentum @xmath21 .    combining ( [ leonid1 ] ) and ( [ leonid3 ] ) one finds @xmath22 as an example ,",
    "the @xmath23-like state which belongs to the chiral multiplet @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be represented as @xcite @xmath26 representations are complete for two - particle systems with the quantum numbers @xmath27 , the angular momentum expansion is uniquely determined for each chiral state .",
    "chiral symmetry imposes strong restrictions on the spin and angular momentum distribution of a system .",
    "the decomposition has been used in ref . to test the chiral symmetry breaking of the @xmath23 meson in the infrared , and at the same time , to reconstruct its spin and orbital angular momentum content in terms of partial waves .",
    "this was achieved by using interpolators that transform according to @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",
    "if chiral symmetry were not broken there would be only two possible chiral states in the meson , while chiral symmetry breaking would imply a superposition of both .",
    "the obtained result in ref .",
    "indicates that the @xmath0 component of the @xmath23-meson in the infrared is indeed a superposition of the @xmath24 and @xmath28 chiral states , and therefore chiral symmetry turns out to be broken . by using transformation ( [ rho1 ] ) and ( [ rho2 ] ) the partial wave content",
    "can be extracted , obtaining for the particular case of the @xmath23 meson , a nearly pure @xmath29 state @xcite .",
    "this is an example of application , see also refs . .",
    "in this paper we will not discuss problems in which the chiral basis or its transformation can play a role as was done in refs . or , for instance .",
    "the problem we want to address here is more technical and related to the transformation ( [ chiral : to : ls ] ) itself . the unitary transformation ( [ chiral : to : ls ] )",
    "was obtained in the instant form of relativistic quantum mechanics . in this work",
    "we investigate the corresponding expression one should use in the context of approaches that use light - front quantization @xcite or front - form relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "we pose the question whether the transformation ( [ chiral : to : ls ] ) is identical in any other form @xcite or if it is a special feature of those that use canonical spin , such as the instant- or the point - forms .",
    "the problem is not trivial since in relativistic composite systems the internal degrees of freedom transform among themselves nontrivially under rotations @xcite .",
    "relativity mixes spatial and temporal components , and as a consequence , one is not allowed to treat boosts and angular momentum separately in general . the election of a particular representation matters and in some cases some of the symmetry properties of the poincar group might not be manifest .",
    "the front form is of special interest , since rotations do not form a subgroup of the kinematical group and hence , rotational invariance is not manifest . on the other hand",
    ", front - form boosts form a subgroup of the poincar group , and as a result , the front - form wigner rotation becomes the identity @xcite .    in this article",
    "we will show that the unitary transformation derived in ref . in instant form",
    "is indeed identical in the front form of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the argument resides in the fact that the _ generalized melosh rotation _ that transforms front - form spins to helicity ones , becomes the identity when the mass goes to zero @xcite .",
    "due to rotational and translational invariance in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , the angular momentum coupling of two particles with individual spin and orbital angular momentum @xmath30 and @xmath31 to give a composite system of total spin and orbital angular momentum @xmath32 is easily realized by using the @xmath3 clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "relativity involves however , a change of representation in which the single - particle momenta and spins are replaced by an overall system momentum and internal angular momentum @xcite .",
    "it is customary to use the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the poincar group @xcite .",
    "the kind of spin vector can be fully determined through the choice of a certain type of boost .",
    "canonical boosts are rotationless .",
    "spin vectors defined through canonical boosts have the advantage that in the center of momentum frame they transform under rotations in the same way as in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , and therefore , for a composite system one can find a direct decomposition in terms of @xmath3 clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the reason is that in the canonical case the wigner rotation associated with a pure rotation , turns out to be the rotation itself @xcite .",
    "this does not hold in general . in the front form ,",
    "rotational invariance is not manifest , and an angular momentum decomposition in terms of clebsch - gordan coefficients requires additional transformations .    expression ( [ leonid3 ] ) can be achieved in a straightforward manner in non relativistic quantum mechanics , as well as in the instant form of dynamics or in any other form that uses canonical spin .",
    "the derivation of ( [ leonid3 ] ) can be found in ref . .",
    "we will reproduce it here in a basis of eigenstates of the poincar group in order to be able to refer some steps that concern what will be exposed in the next section .",
    "we decompose the spin part of a two - particle state with total canonical angular momentum @xmath33 and @xmath34-component @xmath35 , orbital angular momentum @xmath21 and total spin @xmath36 , in terms of quantum numbers of the constituents in the center of momentum frame ( @xmath37 ) , where the relative momentum is expressed as @xmath38 ,    @xmath39    where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the individual canonical spins and their @xmath34-projections .    given a particular direction @xmath43 , where the tensor product state can be written @xmath44 one can write @xmath45|\\mathbf k| j ; \\mathbf 0\\ , m\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{m_lm_s}\\sum_{\\sigma_1\\sigma_2}\\psi_{s_1\\sigma_1}(\\mathbf k )   \\psi_{s_2\\sigma_2}(-\\mathbf k )   c^{sm_s}_{s_1\\sigma_1 s_2\\sigma_2 } y_{lm_l}(\\mathbf{\\hat{\\mathbf k}})\\ ; c^{jm}_{lm_lsm_s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to express it in terms of helicities one needs to transform states with canonical spin to a basis of states with helicity spin .",
    "the unitary transformation that provides this is a wigner rotation whose argument corresponds to the angle between the @xmath46-axis and the direction of motion @xmath47 @xmath48 replacing in ( [ landauformel ] ) one gets @xmath49    it is convenient to write the spherical harmonics in terms of wigner @xmath50-functions in the definition of the phase of the spherical function . ]",
    "@xmath51 in such a way that one can make use of the relation for the product of wigner @xmath50-functions with the same argument for axially symmetric systems @xcite , @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 accounting for the euler angles .",
    "this leads to @xmath56    the fact that the wigner @xmath50-functions in ( [ helicity : decomp ] ) have the same argument , is a particular feature of the instant form , and it is restricted to the rest frame @xcite .",
    "it is easy to identify the needed matrix elements as @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 this permits the translation from two - particle helicity states with total angular momentum @xmath33 , to a one - particle state of overall orbital angular momentum @xmath21 and intrinsic spin @xmath20 .",
    "the connexion with chirality is immediately given by ( [ leonid1 ] ) .",
    "( [ landauformel ] ) describes the angular momentum decomposition of a representation of canonical spin into a superposition of representations with canonical spin .",

    "let us recall that the purpose of the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the poincar group is to convert any kind of spin to canonical spin in the rest frame , in such a way that they can be added using @xmath3 clebsch - gordan coefficients @xcite . in the system rest frame ,",
    "the only feature that distinguishes front - form spins from canonical ones is the fact that front - form spins are characterized for being invariant under front - form boosts .",
    "this difference is accounted by the melosh rotation ( cf .",
    "( [ ff : clebschgordan ] ) ) . as a last remark ,",
    "let us also mention that it would have been possible to develop such a decomposition for any type of spin .",
    "the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the poincar group for an arbitrary form are given in ref . .",
    "proceeding in an analogous way as before , it is possible to see that again the wigner @xmath50-functions do not have the same argument , and it is not possible to bring them together to an overall rotation by means of @xmath3 clebsch - gordan coefficients . only in the chiral limit",
