    "it has always been a great challenge of nuclear physics to develop experiments and theoretical models able to explore short - range correlations ( src )",
    ". a detailed investigation of these correlations , which are induced by the repulsive components of the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction , should give insight into the structure of the interaction of two nucleons in the nuclear medium .",
    "since a long time electromagnetically induced two - nucleon knockout reactions have been devised as a powerful tool for such investigation , since the probability that a real or virtual photon is absorbed by a pair of nucleons should be a direct measure of the correlations between these nucleons  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ( @xmath5 ) reaction has been envisaged as the preferential tool for studying src in nuclei , since in such a reaction the competing contributions of two - body currents are highly suppressed .",
    "such triple coincidence experiments have been made possible only recently by the progress in accelerator and detector technology .",
    "first measurements of the exclusive @xmath1o(@xmath5)@xmath3c reaction have been performed at nikhef in amsterdam  @xcite and mami in mainz  @xcite .",
    "investigations on these data  @xcite indicate that resolution of discrete final states provides an interesting tool to disentangle and thus separately investigate contributions of one - body currents , due to src , and two - body isobar currents",
    ". in particular , direct and clear evidence for src has been obtained for the transition to the ground state of @xmath3c .",
    "this result opens up good perspectives that further theoretical and experimental efforts on two - nucleon knockout reactions will be able to determine src .",
    "good opportunities to increase the richness of information available from two - nucleon knockout reactions is offered by polarization experiments .",
    "in fact , only the use of polarization degrees of freedom allows one to obtain complete information on all possible reaction matrix elements .",
    "reactions with polarized particles depend on a larger number of observables , which are hidden in the unpolarized case , where the sum and/or average over spin states is performed .",
    "these observables are represented by new response functions  @xcite , whose determination can impose more severe constraints on theoretical models .",
    "in fact , some of these observables are expected to be sensitive to the small components of the transition amplitudes , which without polarization are generally masked by the dominant ones .",
    "these small amplitudes often contain interesting information on subtle effects and may thus represent a stringent test of theoretical models .",
    "this is the place where polarization observables enter , because in general they contain interference terms of the various matrix elements in different ways .",
    "thus , a small amplitude may be considerably amplified by the interference with a dominant one .    a complete experimental determination of the transition amplitudes requires a long - term program involving the development of new experimental techniques and many different polarization measurements able to separate various sets of structure functions .",
    "unfortunately , some of these measurements are extremely difficult in general and in particular in the case of two - nucleon knockout",
    ". therefore , a complete determination represents at present a too ambitious programme .    in order to exploit , at least partially , the potentiality of polarization measurements , it is possible , however , to select and investigate specific situations corresponding to simpler experiments that appear feasible in the near future .",
    "they should allow one to gain a better control on the reaction mechanism of two - nucleon knockout and hopefully study src .",
    "as a first step in the study of spin degrees of freeedom in electromagnetic two - nucleon knockout reactions , we consider in this work nucleon recoil polarization .",
    "first theoretical predictions have been already presented in refs .",
    "@xcite within the theoretical model developed by the gent group . here",
    "we give the most general formalism of ( @xmath0 ) reactions in terms of structure functions and polarization observables .",
    "numerical results are shown for the specific case of the exclusive @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath3c reaction for transitions to the lowest - lying states of the residual nucleus .",
    "calculations have been performed within the theoretical framework of ref .",
    "this model , that has been successfully applied in the analysis of the first experimental cross sections  @xcite , gives a reasonably realistic base to our numerical predictions .",
    "results for the components of the outgoing proton polarization and of the polarization transfer coefficient are presented and discussed in different kinematics .",
    "measurements of the proton recoil polarization require an efficient proton polarimeter and a double scattering .",
    "in addition , measurements of the polarization transfer coefficient require also a polarized electron beam .",
    "such experiments are therefore not easy , but seem reasonably within reach of available facilities .",

    "in general , the polarization of an outgoing nucleon , which is the expectation value of the spin , can be calculated as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scattering amplitude of the reaction .",
    "the coincidence cross section of an ( @xmath0 ) reaction , where two nucleons , with momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 and energies @xmath11 and @xmath12 , are emitted and the polarization of only one nucleon , with spin directed along @xmath13 , is detected can be written @xmath14 , \\label{eq : cs}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the energy of the outgoing electron , @xmath16 the unpolarized differential cross section , @xmath17 the outgoing nucleon polarization , @xmath18 the electron helicity , @xmath19 the electron analyzing power and @xmath20 the polarization transfer coefficient .    the cross section and the polarization can be expressed in terms of the components of the hadron tensor @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the eigenvalues of the spin of the considered particle in the given reference frame and @xmath24 is the momentum transfer .",
    "the quantities @xmath25 are the fourier transforms of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear charge - current density operator between initial and final nuclear states @xmath26    the symmetrical and antisymmetrical combinations of the components of the hadron tensor produce nine spin dependent structure functions",
    ". the spin dependence can be explicited in a spherical basis ( see appendix ) as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the unit vector in the spin space .",
    "the structure functions represent the response of the nucleus to the longitudinal and transverse components of the electromagnetic interaction and only depend on the energy and momentum transfer @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the momenta of the two outgoing nucleons @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the angles @xmath33 , between @xmath9 and @xmath24 , @xmath34 , between @xmath10 and @xmath24 , and @xmath35 , between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . when the outgoing nucleon polarization is not detected and the cross section is summed over the spin quantum numbers of the outgoing nucleon , the spin independent structure functions @xmath36 go over to the structure functions @xmath37 of the unpolarized case  @xcite .",
    "thus , in this case only nine structure functions are obtained .",
    "new structure functions are produced in the polarized case by the components of @xmath38    the components of the polarization and of the polarization transfer coefficient are obtained through the structure functions and , involving also the matrix elements of the lepton tensor @xmath39 and @xmath40  @xcite , are given by @xmath41 and @xmath42    the vectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 are usually projected onto the basis of unit vectors given by @xmath45 ( parallel to the momentum @xmath46 of the outgoing particle ) , @xmath47 ( in the direction of @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 , which define the cm helicity frame of the particle .    the explicit expressions of the cross section in terms of the structure functions and of the structure functions in terms of the components of the hadron tensor can be found in appendix .    for the ( @xmath0 ) reaction in an unrestricted kinematics all the components @xmath50 and @xmath51 are allowed , as parity conservation does not impose in this case any restrictions . in this general situation 36",
    "structure functions are present : nine spin independent structure functions in @xmath16 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath53 ) , and nine spin dependent structure functions in each one of the components @xmath54 of @xmath43 ( @xmath55 ) and @xmath44 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "this number is reduced in particular situations ( see appendix for more details ) . when the angle @xmath22 between the @xmath9 @xmath24 plane and the electron scattering plane is equal to zero , all the 36 structure functions are in general non - vanishing , but those of them which are multiplied by @xmath57 or @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cssec ] ) do not contribute to the cross section and to the components of @xmath43 and @xmath44 . as a consequence , the condition @xmath59 reduces to 24 the number of structure functions .",
    "when the vectors @xmath24 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 lie in the same plane , parity conservation combined with the general properties of the hadron tensor reduces the number of non - vanishing structure functions to 18 : five in @xmath16 and @xmath19 and 13 in the components of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this result is similar to that obtained for the ( @xmath60 ) reaction in an unrestricted kinematics  @xcite .    for a coplanar kinematics , i.e. when the initial and final electrons and the outgoing nucleons lie in the same plane , those of the 18 non - vanishing structure functions which",
    "are multiplied by @xmath57 or @xmath58 do not contribute and the number is reduced to 12 , 4 spin independent and 8 spin dependent , and only the components @xmath61 and @xmath62 survive .",
    "this result is similar to that obtained for the ( @xmath60 ) reaction in a coplanar kinematics  @xcite .",
    "a particular situation occurs in the interesting case of the super - parallel kinematics , where the two outgoing nucleons are ejected parallel and antiparallel to the momentum transfer . in this case",
    "only two structure functions , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , do not vanish in the unpolarized cross section and three , @xmath65 , when polarization is considered . as a consequence , @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    "are each directly proportional to only one structure function .",
    "this result is similar to the one obtained for the ( @xmath60 ) reaction in parallel kinematics  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate what happens when final - state interactions ( fsi ) are neglected and the plane - wave ( pw ) approximation is used for the outgoing nucleons wave functions .",
    "the behaviour of the hadron tensor under time reversal and parity transformation has the property  @xcite    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the spin vector in the ejectile rest frame , and the dependence on the final state boundary condition for incoming @xmath68 and outgoing @xmath69 scattered waves is shown . for nucleon knockout ,",
    "the @xmath68 condition is appropriate . when the boundary conditions can be ignored , as in the pw approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pick ] ) states that the symmetric part of @xmath70 is independent of @xmath67 and the antisymmetric part is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "this is because , owing to the spin-@xmath71 nature of the nucleon , the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath67 is at most linear .",
    "therefore , in the pw approximation @xmath72 , while @xmath44 does not vanish .",
    "an experimental separation of the various structure functions would be of great interest , but appears extremely difficult . a measurement of the nucleon recoil polarization would be simpler and less affected by experimental errors , as it is obtained through the determination of asymmetries .",
    "therefore , in this section we present numerical predictions for the outgoing proton polarization @xmath43 and the polarization transfer coefficient @xmath44 of the @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath3c reaction leading to the lowest - lying discrete states in the residual nucleus .",
    "this reaction is of particular interest for our investigation , due to the presence of discrete states in the experimental spectrum of the residual nucleus @xmath3c , well separated in energy and that can be separated with high - resolution experiments .",
    "cross sections calculations pointed out that transitions to different states can be differently affected by the two reaction processes due to src and two - body currents  @xcite .",
    "thus , the experimental separation of different final states can act as a filter for the study of the two processes .",
    "recent experiments at nikhef and mami  @xcite have been able to resolve the lowest - lying states of @xmath3c and have confirmed , in comparison with the theoretical results , the predicted selectivity of the exclusive reaction involving different transitions . in particular , clear evidence of the dominant contribution of src has been obtained for the transition to the 0@xmath74 ground state , while the transition to the 1@xmath74 state at 11.31 mev appears better dominated by the @xmath75 isobar current .",
    "new and complementary information is in principle available from polarization observables .",
    "the aim of our investigation is to clarify the sensitivity of @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the two competing reaction processes and in particular to src .",
    "calculations have been performed within the same theoretical model  @xcite used for the analysis of the available cross section data .",
    "a detailed description of the theoretical framework can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and in a series of previous papers where the different aspects of the model have been developed  @xcite .",
    "here we summarize only the main features .",
    "the transition matrix elements @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jm ] ) , for an exclusive reaction and under the assumption of a direct knockout mechanism , can be reduced to a form which contains three main ingredients : the two - nucleon overlap integral , the nuclear current and the final - state wave function of the two outgoing nucleons .    in the calculations",
    "the scattering state is given by the product of two uncoupled single - particle distorted wave functions , eigenfunctions of a complex phenomenological optical potential which contains a central , a coulomb and a spin - orbit term .",
    "the nuclear current operator is the sum of a one - body and a two - body part .",
    "these two parts correspond to the two reaction processes .",
    "in fact , while two nucleons are naturally ejected by a two - body current , even if correlations are not explicitly included in the two - nucleon wave function , they can not be ejected by a one - body current without correlations .",
    "thus , the contribution of the one - body current is entirely due to correlations . in the calculations the one - body part contains a coulomb , a convective and a spin term . for @xmath77 knockout the two - body current , which is completely transverse , contains only the contributions of non charge - exchange processes with intermediate @xmath75-isobar configurations in the intermediate state  @xcite .",
    "the two - nucleon overlap integrals are taken , for the different final states , from the calculation of the two - proton spectral function of @xmath1o  @xcite , where long - range and short - range correlations are consistently included .",
    "they are expressed in terms of a sum of products of relative and cm wave functions .",
    "different components of relative and cm motion contribute to different transitions .",
    "they are weighed in the sum by two - proton removal amplitudes calculated within a large shell - model basis .",
    "src are included in the radial wave functions of relative motion through defect functions , defined by the difference between correlated and uncorrelated relative wave functions , and which are different for different relative states and for different @xmath4 potentials .",
    "therefore , src play a different role in different relative states .",
    "they are quite strong for the @xmath78 state and much weaker for @xmath79 states ( the notation @xmath80 , for @xmath81 , is here used for the relative states ) .",
    "an opposite effect is given by the two - body @xmath75 current , whose contribution is strongly reduced for @xmath78 @xmath77 knockout , since there the generally dominant contribution of that current , due to the magnetic dipole @xmath82 transition , is suppressed  @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath78 @xmath77 knockout is generally dominated by src , while the @xmath75 current is more important in @xmath79 @xmath77 knockout .",
    "this result explains the above mentioned selectivity of the exclusive cross sections involving the transitions to the 0@xmath74 ground state and the 1@xmath74 state .",
    "in fact , only @xmath83 relative states , @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 , contribute for the 1@xmath74 state , whose cross section is generally dominated by the @xmath75 current .",
    "the two relative waves @xmath78 and @xmath85 contribute for the 0@xmath74 ground state and it is possible to envisage suitable kinematics where the role of @xmath78 @xmath77 knockout and thus of src becomes dominant .    in our investigation of polarization observables in the @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath3c reaction calculations",
    "have been performed in different kinematics . in order to obtain a more complete information it is interesting to consider both coplanar and out - of - plane kinematics .",
    "experiments in coplanar kinematics are certainly simpler , but give access only to the components @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath62 , while all the components of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are present in an out - of - plane kinematics .",
    "a special and interesting case of coplanar kinematics is represented by the so - called super - parallel kinematics  @xcite , where the knocked - out nucleons are detected parallel and anti - parallel to the transferred momentum @xmath24 .",
    "this kinematics , that has been realized in the experiments at mami  @xcite , is favored by the fact that only two structure functions , @xmath91 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath92 ( @xmath64 ) , contribute to the unpolarized cross section @xmath16 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath62 are each directly proportional to one structure function : @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , respectively .",

    "are explored , for a fixed value of the energy and momentum transfer and for a particular final state , changing the values of the kinetic energies of the outgoing nucleons .",
    "an analysis of the results as a function of the recoil momentum appears of particular interest .",
    "the shape of the unpolarized differential cross section is determined by the value of the cm orbital angular momentum @xmath107 of the knocked out pair  @xcite .",
    "different components of relative and cm motion contribute to the two - nucleon overlap functions for each final state .",

    "the contribution of the @xmath78 component is , however , reduced and that of @xmath85 enhanced . as a consequence , the role of @xmath85 @xmath77 knockout , dominated by the @xmath75 current , is enhanced in the final cross section .",
    "this effect slightly changes the shape of the final distribution . on the other hand , when @xmath130 the role of the @xmath75 current becomes much more important also on the @xmath78 component , as can be seen from the comparison between the results in the left and right panels .",
    "therefore , in the final cross section the contribution of the @xmath75 current becomes competitive with that of the one - body current even for the transition to the @xmath96 state .",
    "this is the main difference with respect to the result of the coplanar kinematics and is due to the different role played by the structure functions which are multiplied by factors including the angle @xmath22 . in particular , a significant role is played by the structure functions multiplied by @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which do not contribute in the coplanar kinematics , and where the effect of the @xmath75 current is important .    in the kinematics with @xmath133",
    "the cross section is about an order of magnitude lower than in the peak region of the coplanar kinematics and has a different shape . in practice",
    ", the peak has disappeared and there is no more evidence of an @xmath111 shape distribution .",
    "in fact , the two contributions of @xmath78 and @xmath85 turn out to be of comparable size in this case . in spite of that , the major role is still played by the one - body current , whose contribution is relevant , even though not dominant , also on the @xmath85 relative wave . a part of the differences with respect to the results of the coplanar kinematics is due to the different structure functions and to their dependence on the angle @xmath126 .",
    "the main reason of the differences , however , can be attributed to a kinematic effect .",
    "in fact , when the outgoing nucleon is taken out of the plane , different values of the recoil momentum @xmath98 are obtained in the considered range of @xmath34 . in particular , low values in the range between @xmath134 and @xmath135 mev/@xmath114 are forbidden .",
    "thus , the main source of difference with respect to the coplanar situation is that the region of momenta between @xmath134 and @xmath135 mev/@xmath114 , where the @xmath111 wave has the maximum and the @xmath112 wave a minimum , has been cut .",
    "this explains the different shape of the angular distributions in the top and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the components of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the two kinematics with @xmath136 and @xmath133 are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] and  [ fig : fig6 ] , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , with @xmath130 , the components @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath62 , already present in coplanar kinematics , are significantly different from those displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] for the same transition .",
    "the differences are larger for @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath75 current gives the major contribution to @xmath88 and @xmath62 .",
    "the one - body current gives the main contribution to @xmath87 , but in this kinematics the effect of the @xmath75 current is meaningful also on this polarization component and larger than in coplanar kinematics .",
    "of the three observables @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , which are present only in an out - of - plane kinematics , @xmath137 is small , while @xmath138 and @xmath139 are sizable .",
    "however , both contributions of src and two - body currents are large and intertwined in these polarization components . therefore",
    ", the kinematics with @xmath130 does not seem particularly well suited to disentangle the two reaction processes and study src .",
    "correlation effects are much more important in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , for the kinematics with @xmath133 . in this case",
    "all the components of the outgoing proton polarization @xmath43 are sizable and driven by the one - body current , which gives the main contribution also to @xmath137 .",
    "this component of the polarization transfer coefficient , however , is small also in this kinematics .",
    "the other components @xmath88 and @xmath62 are large , but also in this case strongly affected by both contributions of the two reaction processes due to src and two - body currents .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the general properties of the nucleon recoil polarization in the ( @xmath0 ) reaction . in the most general situation",
    "no restrictions are due to parity conservation and 36 structure functions are active , more than in the ( @xmath60 ) reaction , where parity conservation reduces the number of structure functions available in an unconstrained kinematics to 18 .",
    "the same formal situation is obtained in ( @xmath0 ) only when the momenta of the two outgoing nucleons and the momentum transfer lie in the same plane .",
    "a minor number of structure functions can be obtained in more restricted kinematics : 12 in a coplanar kinematics , as in the coplanar kinematics of ( @xmath60 ) , and 5 in the special case of the super - parallel kinematics , as in the parallel kinematics of ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "an experimental determination of the structure functions would be of great interest , but appears at present extremely difficult . in order to exploit the potentiality of polarization measurements to increase the richness of information available in two - nucleon knockout reactions ,",
    "it is anyhow possible to envisage other interesting polarization experiments which appear more feasible . as an example ,",
    "a measurement of the nucleon recoil polarization , which is obtained through the determination of asymmetries , should be reasonably within reach of available facilities .    a complete investigation of all the components of the outgoing nucleon polarization @xmath43 and of the polarization transfer coefficient @xmath44 , which implies also a polarized electron beam , requires out - of - plane experiments . in the simpler case of a coplanar kinematics",
    "only the components @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath62 are available , as in the coplanar kinematics of the ( @xmath60 ) reaction . moreover , as in ( @xmath60 )",
    ", all the components of the outgoing nucleon polarization @xmath43 vanish in the pw approximation .    the aim of this work was to explore the capability of polarization measurements to disentangle and separately investigate the two reaction processes due to correlations and two - body currents . with this aim and within our theoretical framework ,",
    "we have checked the sensitivity of @xmath43 and @xmath44 to the two competing processes .",
    "numerical predictions have been presented for the specific case of the exclusive @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath3c reaction leading to the lowest - lying discrete states of the residual nucleus .",
    "our results confirm that the contribution of src as compared with that of the @xmath75 current depends on the final state of the residual nucleus and that the transition to the ground state of @xmath3c is particularly sensitive to correlation effects .",
    "calculations performed in the coplanar kinematical settings realized for the cross section measurements at nikhef and mami indicate that for the transition to the ground state the major contribution to the only surviving component of the outgoing proton polarization , perpendicular to the plane , is given by correlations , while effects of two - body currents are almost negligible .",
    "in contrast , these effects are much more important or even dominant on the components of the polarization transfer coefficient .    in more complicated non coplanar kinematics",
    "the number of available observables increases , but their sensitivity to nuclear correlations is reduced .",
    "it is possible to envisage particular conditions where correlation effects are dominant , but they correspond to situations where measurements are more difficult and cross sections generally smaller .    in conclusion , we believe that a combined measurement of cross sections and polarizations in ( @xmath2 ) reactions would provide a unique tool to determine short - range nuclear correlations and could positively contribute to clarify the behaviour of the short - range interaction of nucleons in the nuclear medium .    the analysis of polarization observables can be extended to other electromagnetic two - nucleon knockout reactions , such as ( @xmath140 ) , ( @xmath141 ) and ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "recent calculations  @xcite have shown that the cross section of the exclusive @xmath1o(@xmath143)@xmath3n reaction are sensitive to details of the nuclear correlations considered and in particular to the presence of the tensor component .",
    "therefore , a study of polarization observables in the ( @xmath140 ) reaction would be of particular interest for the study of tensor correlations .",
    "cross sections and photon asymmetries calculated for both ( @xmath142 ) and ( @xmath141 ) knockout reactions are dominated by two - body currents and only slightly affected by correlation effects  @xcite .",
    "thus , reactions induced by real photons do not seem particularly well suited to study correlations , but are anyhow interesting to give complementary information on other theoretical ingredients , for instance on the nuclear currents .",
    "moreover , polarization observables could amplify the role of small amplitudes and of subtle effects hidden in the unpolarized case .",
    "therefore , also ( @xmath142 ) and ( @xmath141 ) reactions deserve a careful investigation .",
    "the components of the hadron tensor @xmath70 are to be restricted by the conditions of current conservation @xmath144 therefore , the sixteen components of the tensor are reduced to nine independent quantities . by separating the symmetrical and antisymmetrical terms , one obtains six symmetrical and three antysimmetrical independent components .    a spherical basis can be used and defined by the four - vectors @xmath145 where @xmath146 .",
    "( note that this spherical basis is consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite , and is different from the one used in other papers , where @xmath147 . )    then , nine structure functions are obtained as a function of the hadron tensor components  @xcite .",
    "their expressions are given in table  1 , in the reference frame where the @xmath148 axis is taken parallel to @xmath24 and the momentum @xmath9 lies in the @xmath149 plane .",
    "the triple coincidence cross section for the electron induced reaction where two nucleons are emitted is obtained from the contraction between the lepton tensor and the hadron tensor as a linear combination of the nine structure functions  @xcite @xmath150 \\big \\ } , \\label{eq : cssec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is the mott scattering cross section , @xmath152 @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the relativistic energy and momentum of the residual nucleus , @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 and @xmath159 and @xmath15 are the energies of the incident and outgoing electrons . the components of the lepton tensor @xmath160 and @xmath161 can be deduced from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cssec ] ) .",
    "the structure functions depend on the kinematical variables of the particular process under investigation .",
    "even if a large number of variables are involved , at most four independent four - momenta are available in the lorentz frame .",
    "therefore , the hadron tensor can be expanded on the basis of four independent variables  @xcite . in the case of two - nucleon emission",
    "different choices are possible .",
    "one can refer to the target four - momentum @xmath162 , the momentum transfer @xmath163 , the ejectile four - momentum @xmath164 and the four vector @xmath165 the expansion coefficients can depend on the invariants @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the spin of the outgoing nucleon with momentum @xmath9 , which are scalars and @xmath169 and @xmath170 , which are pseudoscalars .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that both scalars and pseudoscalars , both dependent on and independent of @xmath168 , are available .",
    "the four - vector @xmath168 , in the reference frame where @xmath171 , is given by @xmath168 = ( 0 , @xmath172 ) and can be boosted in the laboratory frame as  @xcite @xmath173 therefore , we obtain the invariants @xmath174 @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the nucleon mass and @xmath177 the target mass , and @xmath178    it is clear from the above equations that @xmath167 is proportional to @xmath179 , @xmath180 to @xmath181 and @xmath182 has a component proportional to @xmath183 . since we can obtain from these invariants both scalars and pseudoscalars which linearly contain the spin , il follows that no restrictions due to parity conservation can in general be derived concerning the dependence of the different structure functions on the components of the spin , in contrast with what happens in the ( @xmath60 ) reaction .",
    "these restrictions are recovered in the particular case of a reaction where the outgoing nucleon momenta @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the momentum transfer @xmath24 lie all in the same plane . in this case",
    "the invariant @xmath170 = 0 , and neither scalars proportional to @xmath181 and @xmath183 , nor pseudoscalars proportional to @xmath179 are obtained .",
    "this result is independent of the electron plane and corresponds to the typical situation , in an unrestricted kinematics , of the ( @xmath60 ) reaction .",
    "in general , for the ( @xmath0 ) reaction , the dependence of the structure functions on the spin can be explicited remembering that for a particle with spin @xmath184 only a linear dependence is allowed , as @xmath185 where @xmath13 is the unit vector in the spin space .",
    "thus , when the polarization of the outgoing nucleon is considered , 36 structure functions @xmath36 and @xmath186 are obtained .",
    "the explicit expressions of these structure functions in terms of the components of the hadron tensor @xmath187 can be easily obtained from table i , by simply substituting the quantities @xmath70 , wherever they appear , with the following expressions : @xmath188 usually , the quantities @xmath38 and @xmath189 are projected onto the basis of unit vectors @xmath47 , @xmath45 and @xmath190 defined in sec .",
    "ii and the structure functions are thus given for the components @xmath191 .    in the most general situation",
    "all the 36 structure functions do not vanish .",
    "when the electrons are on the @xmath149 plane , i.e. when @xmath22 = 0 , the structure functions which are multiplied by @xmath57 or @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cssec ] ) do not contribute . in this case",
    "only 24 structure functions contribute to the cross section and polarizations .",
    "when the two outgoing nucleons and the momentum transfer lie in the same plane , we recover formally the typical situation of the ( @xmath60 ) reaction  @xcite and only 18 structure functions do not vanish .",
    "in all these cases all the components of the polarization and of the polarization transfer coefficient are in principle different from zero . in a coplanar kinematics ,",
    "i.e. when the momenta of the electrons and of the outgoing nucleons lie in the same plane , we recover the typical situation of the ( @xmath60 ) reaction in coplanar kinematics , where only 12 structure functions contribute and only @xmath61 and @xmath62 do not vanish .",
    "finally , in the super - parallel kinematics only 5 structure functions survive , as in the parallel kinematics of the ( @xmath60 ) reaction .",
