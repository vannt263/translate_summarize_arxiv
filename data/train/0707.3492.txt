    "the law of the electric charge conservation , related to the existence of the unbroken local u(1 ) gauge symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) , is thought to be an absolute conservation law .",
    "however , `` ... the basic principles of theoretical physics can not be accepted _ a priori _ , no matter how convincing they may seem , but rather must be justified on the basis of relevant experiments '' @xcite .",
    "thus , new experimental tests of old and fully established laws of physics are of importance as they could provide new unexpected results @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the quantization of the electric charge has also been established with a high level of accuracy , while the question of why the electric charge is quantized seems has yet unknown answer .",
    "going beyond the sm , it is possible to have particles with a small fractional ( milli ) charge , e.g. by introducing additional u(1 ) symmetry of a hidden - sector @xcite .",
    "these considerations have stimulated new theoretical works and experimental tests reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "+ not long ago , it has been pointed out that in some models with infinite extra dimensions , describing our world as a brane embedded in higher dimensional space @xcite , particles initially located on our brane may leave the brane and disappear into extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the experimental signature of this effect is the disappearance of the particles in our world , i.e. the @xmath3 decay .",
    "these transitions have been found to be generic in a class of models of localization of particles on a brane .",
    "the localization becomes incomplete if particles get small masses and they could tunnel from the brane into extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "an example of this process for a neutral system , orthopositronium ( @xmath4 ) , a triplet bound state of an electron and positron , has been considered in ref.@xcite . it has been shown that the effect may occur at a rate within two orders of magnitude of the present best experimental limit on the branching ratio of the @xmath5 decay @xmath6 ( 90% c.l . ) from the recent eth - inr experiment @xcite .",
    "if , however , particles that leave our brane are electrically charged , their disappearance into extra dimensions would result in the nonconservation of electric charge seen by our four - dimensional experiment .",
    "it should be pointed out , that , of course , in this scenario electric charge is conserved in the full multi - dimensional space @xcite . as our experiment is not sensitive to the charge localized outside the brane it would detect the charge nonconservation through the @xmath3 decay . in the example illustarted in fugure",
    "[ fig : brane ] , a muon produced in the @xmath7 decay escapes into extra dimensions resulting in the @xmath8 decay .     schematic illustration of the disappearance of muon produced in the @xmath7 decay : neutrino propagates along the our brane while the muon escapes into extra dimensions.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    hence , one may conclude that an observation of the process of a particle disappearance would provide a strong evidence for the existence of extra dimensional world",
    ". it may be worthwhile to remember that the process with the analogous experimental signature , @xmath9 decay of the gauge boson @xmath10 plays a fundamental role in determination of the number of lepton families in the sm .",
    "some examples of charge - nonconserving processes involving leptons and baryons can be found in particle data group @xcite .",
    "experiments searching for the @xmath11 decay test the electron stability and yield lower half - lifetime limits in the range @xmath12 yr . for more recent results see , also @xcite .",
    "one of the most stringent limits for charge - nonconserving decays of neutrons , @xmath13/@xmath14 has been extracted from the reported counting rates of solar neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "as far as the charge - nonconserving @xmath15 decay modes are concerned , they have never been experimentally tested .    in extra - dimensional models",
    "the rate of processes like @xmath16 , is small and might be enhanced for higher masses , but presently can not be reliably predicted as it is depended on unknown parameters of extra - dimensional physics @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to perform direct high sensitivity searches for these unexpected decay modes , whose discovery would lead to discovery of new physics .    in this paper",
    "we obtain the first limit on the electric charge nonconservation in muon and tau decays and show that the muon bound can be significantly improved in a new proposed experiment .",
    "recently , the mulan collaboration has reported on measurements of the mean lifetime @xmath18 of positive muons to a precision of 11 ppm @xcite . using the new world average @xmath19 and the relation between the muon lifetime and the fermi constant @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the sum of phase space , qed and hadronic corrections , results in new determination of the fermi constant @xmath23 to a precision of 5 ppm @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath24 decay exists , it would contribute to the total muon decay rate : @xmath25 and , hence increase the determined value of @xmath20 . to estimate the allowed contribution of @xmath26 to eq.([rate ] ) , one could compare the measured muon decay rate of eq.([taumu ] ) to a predicted muon decay rate , calculated from eq.([width ] ) by using @xmath27 extracted from another measurements which are not affected by the disappearance effect discussed above .",
    "there are a number of indirect prescriptions for extracting of precise values of @xmath20 .",
    "comparison of these quantities can be used to to test the sm and to probe for new physics , for more detail discussions see ref .",
    "for example , one can define @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the weinberg angle , the mass of the @xmath10 gauge bosons and a factor for radiative corrections , respectively .    using the values of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    "reported in @xcite , one can obtain @xmath32    comparing eq.([gf ] ) and eq.([gf1 ] ) and adding statistical and systematic errors in quadrature , one finds @xmath33 which leads to the bound @xmath34    in close analogy with muon decays , the leptonic decay rates of the tau @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xcite can also provide corresponding fermi constants @xcite @xmath37 @xmath38 they agree with @xmath20 of eq.([gf ] ) within 240 ppm and , similar to above considerations , can be used to constrain the @xmath2 decay rate . taking into account the branching ratio of the leptonic decay rate of tau ,",
    "the best limit obtained is @xmath39    the limit of eq.([muon ] ) could be improved by more than seven orders of magnitudes in the proposed experiment discussed below , while to improve significantly the bound on the @xmath2 decay rate might be more difficult due to the problem with the efficient tagging of the tau appearance .",
    "a special study has to be performed in this case .",
    "the main components of the detector to search for the @xmath24 decay are shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "the basic ideas are as follows .",
    "charged pions are stopped in an active target ( @xmath41 ) instrumented with energy deposition and time readout .",
    "the source of muons is the @xmath42 decay at rest in @xmath41 .",
    "the target is surrounded by a hermetic 4@xmath43 electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) to detect energy deposition from the decay @xmath44 of muons stopped in @xmath41 .",
    "the light signals produced in @xmath41 could be readout through the ecal endcap crystal ( @xmath45 ) which acts as a light guide as shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "the @xmath41 signals could be distinguished from the @xmath45 signals due to their significantly different decay times by using the technique described in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the readout of the energy deposition in the ecal is triggered by a tag signal of the muon appearance , which is defined by a coincidence of a signal from a stopped pion and a delayed signal from the stopped decay muon .",
    "the latter should correspond to the 4.2 mev energy deposition in the target from the muon kinetic energy .",
    "schematic illustration of the experimental setup to search for the @xmath24 decay . shown",
    "are the beam defining scintillator counter @xmath46 , which is also used as a veto against decay positrons , the active target @xmath41 , the electromagnetic calorimeter ecal , and the ecal endcap counter ec used as a light guide for the light produced in the target.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the experimental signature of the @xmath47 decay is the apparent disappearance of the energy deposition in the ecal from the ordinary electric charge - conserving @xmath44 decay , i.e. observation of an event with the ecal energy deposition below of a certain threshold @xmath48 . to estimate the sensitivity of the proposed experiment a feasibility study based on geant4 @xcite monte carlo simulations have been performed . however , to investigate the background down to the level @xmath49 with the full simulation would require the generation of a very large number of muon decays resulting in a prohibitively large amount of computer time .",
    "consequently , only the most dangerous background processes are considered and estimated with a smaller statistics combined with numerical calculations .",
    "the beam of positive pions is stopped in the central part of the cylindrical target in a volume of @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "the active target @xmath41 is a plastic scintillator with a diameter of 5 - 10 mm and a height of 10 mm . according to simulations the 4.2 mev muon came to rest passing about 1 mm in @xmath41 .",
    "the ecal is an array of @xmath52 bgo counters each of 52 mm in diameter and 220 mm long , which was previously used in the psi experiment on precise measurements of the @xmath53 decay rate @xcite and then in the eth - inr positronium experiment @xcite .",
    "the following sources of background are considered    * the principal muon decay @xmath54 into the final state with the electron kinetic energy @xmath55 less than the detection energy threshold @xmath48 ( typically 100 - 300 kev ) . indeed , if @xmath56 the event becomes invisible . the partial muon decay rate @xmath57 into the such final state , assuming @xmath58 ( here",
    ", @xmath59 is the electron mass ) , is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the momentum and the maximum allowed momentum of the decay electron , respectively and @xmath62 . to suppress this background",
    ", one has to use as low as possible threshold @xmath48 and to performed the experiment with a well separated _ positive _ pion beam with an extremely small contamination of negative pions ( or muons ) . in this case , if positive muon decays into a low energy positron , the latter will stop in the target and annihilate into two photons at a lifetime scale of the order of a few ns .",
    "thus , for events with @xmath63 the minimum energy deposition in the ecal will be about 1 mev , i.e. well above the threshold , thus making these events visible .",
    "for example , in the eth - inr experiment the probability to observe @xmath64- annihilation energy deposition in the bgo ecal less than the energy threshold of @xmath65 kev was about @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "thus , in the background free experiment one potentially can reach sensitivity in the branching ratio of the invisible muon decay as small as : @xmath67 assuming the detection energy threshold to be as low as @xmath68 kev .",
    "* fake tags of the muon appearance could be due to the following effect .",
    "a muon from the pion decay in flight stops in @xmath41 and decays quickly , within , say , few tens of ns into a low - energy positron which subsequently came also to rest in @xmath41 and annihilates into two photons . if the sum of energies deposited by the positron and annihilation photons , due to their photo - absorption or compton scattering in @xmath41 , is around 4.2 mev this results in the fake muon tag signal . in the case when the positron kinetic energy is about 3 mev and almost all annihilation energy is deposited in @xmath41 the event becomes invisible . to suppress this background the target",
    "should be optimized in size and made of a low - z material to minimize cross - section of the photo - absorption which is @xmath69 .",
    "for example , for plastic scintillator the probability of both 511 kev photons energy absorption in a volume of @xmath70 @xmath51 is found to be less than 10@xmath71 .",
    "the size of the target is important in order to minimize the number of low - energy positrons stopped in @xmath41 .",
    "the monte carlo simulations of low - energy positrons suggests that for suppression of this background the beam spot size and the diameter of @xmath41 have to be as small as possible .",
    "if the @xmath41 diameter is @xmath72 mm , the requirements to get simultaneously the 4.2 mev deposited energy and the positron track stopped in @xmath41 results in suppression of this background processes to the level @xmath73 . * the loss of the muon decay energy due to non - complete hermeticity of the ecal or due to the presence of passive materials . in the present version monte carlo simulations include active materials of the ecal and the target and negligible amount of passive materials from the ecal crystals and the target wrapping .",
    "it is found that the most dangerous background process is associated with energetic positrons escaping the ecal though the beam entrance aperture . to suppress this background the aperture should be reduce to as much as possible size and should be closed by a high efficiency veto counter @xmath46 , as shown in fig.[fig : setup ] , which could also act as the beam defining counter . +",
    "an additional suppression factor came form the fact that the backward moving decay positrons deposit in @xmath41 about 1 mev in addition to 4.2 mev deposited by stopped muons . assuming 10% resolution ( fwhm ) for measurements of energy in @xmath41",
    ", the diameter of the entrance aperture of 1 cm and the inefficiency of @xmath46 @xmath74 leads to the final suppression of this source of background down to the level @xmath73 .    finally let us discuss several additional limitation factors .",
    "the first one is related to the relatively long muon lifetime .",
    "for example , to get the branching ratio @xmath75 , the ecal gate duration @xmath76 , and hence the dead - time per trigger , has to be @xmath77 in order to avoid background from the muon decays outside the gate . in the eth - inr positronium experiment , the ecal gate @xmath78 was about @xmath79 for orthopositronium lifetime in the target of 132 ns .",
    "this resulted in distribution of the sum of pedestals of all ( @xmath52 ) ecal counters corresponded to the threshold of 80 kev used to define the signal range for the @xmath5 decay . in the proposed experiment",
    "the longer gate will lead to an increase of the pile - up and pick - up electronic noise and hence to the overall broadening of the signal range , approximately by a factor @xmath80 and , hence to an increase of the energy threshold roughly up to @xmath81 kev @xcite . for this threshold",
    "the probability of the annihilation energy loss is about @xmath82 @xcite and the overall sensitivity of eq.([sens ] ) drops to a few parts in @xmath83 .",
    "another limitation factor is related to the dead time of eq.([dur ] ) and , hence to the maximally allowed muon counting rate , which according to eq.([dur ] ) has to be @xmath84 to avoid significant pile - up effect . to avoid this limitation",
    ", one could implement a fast first - level trigger rejecting events with the ecal energy deposition greater than @xmath48 and , hence run the experiment at the rate @xmath85 .",
    "thus , in the background free experiment one could expect a sensitivity in the @xmath24 decay branching ratio of the order of @xmath86 , assuming that the exposure to the muon beam with this rate is @xmath87 1 month .",
    "the performed monte carlo simulations give an illustrative correct order of magnitude for the sensitivity of the proposed experiment and may be strengthened by more accurate and detailed monte carlo simulations of the concrete experimental setup .",
    "in this work the first limits on the electric charge - nonconserving @xmath15 decay modes are obtained .",
    "if the @xmath17 decay exists at the level of a few parts in 10@xmath88 , it could be observed in the new proposed experiment .",
    "the preliminary study shows that the quoted sensitivity could be obtained with a setup optimized for several its properties .",
    "namely , i ) the primary beam and the entrance aperture size , ii ) the energy resolution , material composition and dimensions of the target , iii ) the efficiency of the veto counter , and iv ) the pile - up effect and zero - energy threshold in the ecal are of importance .",
    "this low - energy experiment might be a sensitive probe of extra - dimensional physics that is complementary to collider experiments .",
