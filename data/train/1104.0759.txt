    "the curve shortening flow ( csf ) produces a smooth family of curves @xmath0 in the plane @xmath1 , from an initial curve @xmath2 given by an immersion @xmath3 , according to the equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the curvature of the curve @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the outward unit normal , and primes denote derivatives with respect to a local parameter on @xmath8 .",
    "this system has received considerable study , and in particular it is known that for any smooth immersion @xmath9 there exists a unique solution on a finite maximal time interval , and that the maximum curvature becomes unbounded as the maximal time is approached @xcite .",
    "gage @xcite and gage and hamilton @xcite considered the case of convex embedded closed curves , and proved that solutions are asymptotic to shrinking circles as the final time is approached .",
    "grayson @xcite then extended this result to arbitrary embedded closed curves .",
    "our aim in this paper is to provide an estimate on the curvature for embedded closed curves evolving by curve shortening flow , and deduce from this a simple proof of grayson s theorem .    in recent work @xcite we used isoperimetric estimates to deduce curvature bounds for embedded solutions of curve shortening flow .",
    "the result was obtained by controlling the lengths of chords to the evolving curves , as a function of the arc length between the end points and elapsed time , extending an idea introduced by huisken @xcite . in particular sufficiently strong control of chord length for short segments",
    "implies a curvature bound , strong enough to provide a rather simple proof of grayson s theorem .",
    "our argument showed that chord lengths can be bounded from below by a function @xmath10 of arc length @xmath11 and elapsed time @xmath12 , provided @xmath13 satisfies a certain differential inequality .",
    "we then produced an explicit solution of this inequality which we discovered purely by accident , and for which we have no simple motivation .",
    "subsequently @xcite we used similar ideas to give sharp curvature estimates for the normalized ricci flow on the two - sphere .",
    "as before , the key motivating idea is that sufficiently strong control on an isoperimetric profile implies control on curvatures , but in this case we no longer relied on a purely serendipitous calculation : the solutions of the differential equality in that case are in direct correspondence to axially symmetric solutions of the normalized ricci flow itself , and in particular explicit solutions could be constructed from an explicit solution of ricci flow known as the rosenau solution or ` sausage model ' .    in this paper",
    "we show that the same situation arises in curve shortening flow when one estimates the isoperimetric profile of the enclosed region ( related estimates were used by hamilton to rule out slowly forming singularities @xcite ) . as in the ricci flow case",
    ", we deduce a comparison result from any solution of a certain differential inequality , and solutions of the corresponding equality are in direct correspondence with symmetric solutions of the curve shortening flow . using the explicit symmetric solution constructed by angenent ( known as the ` paperclip ' solution",
    ", we deduce a very strong upper bound on curvature for an arbitrary embedded solution of curve shortening flow .",
    "a new ingredient which arises here is that the isoperimetric estimate does not imply lower bounds on the curvature @xmath14 ( in contrast to the result in @xcite where a bound on @xmath15 is deduced for normalized solutions ) .",
    "however we can deduce a suitable lower bound on @xmath14 by estimating the isoperimetric profile of the exterior region , and indeed the lower bounds we obtain ( produced by comparison with a self - similar expanding solution ) have some similarity to those which arise in ricci flow .",
    "to set our conventions , we routinely parametrize simple closed curves in the anticlockwise direction with outward - pointing normal , which means the serret - frenet equations take the form @xmath16    our result is most easily formulated in terms of a normalized version of the curve - shortening flow , which we now introduce : given a solution @xmath17 of , we define @xmath18 by @xmath19}}\\tilde x(p,\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 $ ] is the area enclosed by the curve @xmath6 , and @xmath21}\\,d\\tau',\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad t=\\int_0^{\\tilde t}\\frac{\\pi}{a[\\tilde\\gamma_{\\tau'}]}\\,d\\tau'.\\ ] ] then the rescaled curve @xmath22 has @xmath23=\\pi$ ] for every @xmath12 , and @xmath24 evolves according to the normalized equation @xmath25 where @xmath14 denotes the curvature of @xmath26 .",
