    "figure [ fig : hammingcube](a ) depicts the binary hamming cube  all binary strings of length 3 where strings that differ by one element are one edge length apart , strings differing by two elements are two edge lengths apart etc .",
    "the number of differing elements between two strings is the hamming distance and finding useful arrangements of @xmath0-ary strings ( with prescribed mutual hamming distances ) is the subject of classical coding theory .",
    "let @xmath1 denote an integer that is a prime power .",
    "we will present a construction that associates @xmath0-ary strings with ( i ) hermitian operators in hilbert space of dimension @xmath2 , and ( ii ) pure states in @xmath3 .",
    "we find a remarkably simple relationship between the hamming distance of strings and the hilbert - schmidt or fubini - study distance of the corresponding operators or states , respectively . because of the array of powerful coding - theoretic tools at our disposal",
    ", our construction may be useful for finding arrangements of quantum states or operators that would otherwise not be apparent .",
    "figure [ fig : hammingcube](b ) depicts the so - called simplex code , which is one member of family of @xmath0-ary codes that is well - defined for all prime powers @xmath0 . applying our construction to the codewords of this code ( i.e. , the vertices of the inscribed simplex ) we find a set of operators that correspond to the phase point operators of wootters discrete wigner function .",
    "states that have non - negative quasi - probability representation in this wigner function correspond to states that are not too far from any of the operators associated with the codewords of the code ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : intersecting simplices ] ) .",
    "this perspective on the wigner function and its relationship with quantum state space may prove enlightening .",
    "we will adopt the notation of quantum information theory so that the standard basis has elements @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the inner product on @xmath6 . given an orthonormal basis @xmath7 , a unit vector @xmath8 is called unbiased if @xmath9 for all @xmath10 .",
    "we will focus on hilbert spaces of prime power dimension @xmath0 where it is known that @xmath11 ( the maximal possible number ) mutually unbiased bases always exist . for non - prime - power dimensions",
    "the number of mubs is lower bounded by the largest component in a prime decomposition of @xmath12 , but this is typically much lower than @xmath13 . in subsequent sections we will be interested in connections between mubs and classical coding theory",
    "so we find it convenient to label mub vectors with elements of the finite field , @xmath14 , containing @xmath2 elements .",
    "in fact it is quite natural to use @xmath14 since many mub constructions already use finite fields @xcite so that e.g. gauss sums can be used to prove the required overlap constraints .",
    "a complete set of mubs has one more basis than the number of field elements so we label this basis with @xmath15 .",
    "* mutually unbiased bases:*[def : mubs ] a complete set of mubs in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath2 is given by @xmath11 orthonormal bases @xmath16 , where each basis comprises @xmath17 , and overlaps obey latexmath:[\\ ] ] where we are using coordinates @xmath177 rather than @xmath178 .",
    "it is possible to represent finite - dimensional quantum states as probability distributions over a phase space of discrete points .",
    "however , to recover all the predictions of quantum mechanics we must allow the probability distribution to take on negative values , in other words we must use quasi - probabilities .",
    "such descriptions are referred to as quasi - probability representations , the most famous of which is the wigner function .",
    "wootters introduced a method of constructing discrete wigner functions based on finite fields wherein vectors from a complete set of mubs were put in one - to - one correspondence with the lines of the affine plane @xmath179 @xcite .",
    "the connection with our work is that wigner function of state @xmath180 at some point in phase space is given by the expectation @xmath181 , where @xmath118 is one of the facet operators in def .",
    "[ def : facetops ] and which go by the name phase point operators in the context of wigner functions .",
    "the tools and terminology established in previous sections allow for an interesting interpretation of the relationship between phase point operators with each other and with quantum state space .",
    "wootters discrete wigner function ( dwf ) requires a set of @xmath146 trace - orthogonal phase point operators , which corresponds to a set of facet operators @xmath182 with pairwise hamming distance @xmath183 .",
    "we know that the codewords of @xmath184 satisfy this constraint , as do the codewords of every translate @xmath185 for fixed @xmath186 . in this way we can obtain @xmath187 different dwf by partitioning @xmath188 into @xmath187 cosets of the simplex code via a slepian array as in table [ tab : slepian ] .",
    "this partitioning is a coding - theoretic restatement of the concept of @xmath187 different `` quantum nets '' @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to a particular definition of dwf by its coset @xmath66 , and it is understood that the mubs used in constructing facet operators are those of sec .",
    "[ sec : the weyl - heisenberg group ] .    the wigner function of @xmath180 at the point @xmath189 in phase space",
    "is denoted @xmath190 , and is defined via @xmath191 the quantity @xmath192 is the hilbert - schmidt inner product between the operator @xmath118 and the density matrix @xmath180 , and so demanding that @xmath193 is constraining @xmath180 to be close to @xmath118 in some sense .",
    "in fact the constraints @xmath194 describe a simplex in @xmath6 with @xmath146 bounding facets ( hence the name for facet operators ) .",
    "in general our construction gives @xmath195 another geometrical object of interest is the single - particle ( @xmath44 ) stabilizer polytope defined as the convex hull of all @xmath196 stabilizer mub vectors @xmath197 .",
    "@xcite showed that a halfspace description of the single - qudit stabilizer polytope is given by @xmath198 from the discussion in the previous paragraph we see that the stabilizer polytope is the intersection of all simplices associated with the simplex code and all its cosets ( see figure [ fig : intersecting simplices ] for an illustration of the @xmath199 case ) .",
    "we are interested in non - negatively represented pure states , that is states @xmath200 such that @xmath201 . in figure [ fig : intersecting simplices](a ) we see that nonegatively represented pure qubit states in the dwf with @xmath202 are those that are both ( i ) on the surface of the bloch sphere , and ( ii ) contained within the tetrahedron .",
    "figure [ fig : intersecting simplices](b ) illustrates the same idea for the dwf with @xmath203 .",
    "@xcite showed that the only pure states that are non - negatively represented for all @xmath187 wigner functions ( simultaneously ) are the @xmath204 stabilizer mub states @xmath197 used in the dwf construction and this is illustrated in figure [ fig : intersecting simplices](c , d ) .",
    "when we move to qutrit ( or any odd prime dimension ) state space the story changes slightly from the qubit case we have depicted .",
    "there are now @xmath205 different dwf and we are guaranteed by @xcite that all @xmath206 stabilizer states @xmath197 are non - negatively represented no matter which dwf we use .",
    "however , a result by gross @xcite says that a pure state is non - negatively represented in the dwf with @xmath207 if _ and only if _ it is a stabilizer state .",
    "for qubits the set of non - negatively represented pure states is of finite measure , but for odd - prime qudits it is exactly the set of @xmath196 stabilizer states . moving on to multiple particles of odd prime dimension ( @xmath0 is an odd prime power )",
    "then it seems that gross choice of dwf is the unique one obeying the discrete version of hudson s theorem @xcite : a pure state is non - negatively represented if and only if it is a stabilizer state .",
    "a priori we know that at least @xmath204 stabilizer states will be positively represented but this only represents an exponentially small ( in @xmath53 ) fraction of all @xmath208 stabilizer states .",
    "hence the discrete hudson theorem is a geometrically remarkable fact , as well as having practical relevance for questions surrounding fault - tolerant quantum computing @xcite , resources theories @xcite and contextuality @xcite . to see that @xmath207 recovers gross choice of dwf insert into @xmath209}$ ] and simplify to obtain @xmath210 i.e. , the discrete parity operator ( the parity operator also forms the starting point for the continuous wigner function @xcite )",
    "this particular instance of wootters discrete wigner function is also singled - out by its highly symmetric properties @xcite .",
    "we hope that our way of analyzing these wigner simplices and their relationships with each other and with the set of quantum states will prove enlightening . in principle",
    ", we could construct a wigner - like representation using the alltop @xcite mub vectors @xmath211 , which are equal to the ivanovic mub vectors for @xmath212 and unitarily equivalent but highly non - stabilizer @xcite otherwise @xmath213 .",
    "one could also apply our wigner simplex construction to unitarily - inequivalent mub vectors @xcite .",
    "note that bengtsson and ericsson @xcite , without restricting to stabilizer mubs , have studied the equivalent of wigner simplices and the stabilizer polytope ( the complementarity polytope ) and their relationship to quantum state space .",
    "their construction of a simplex via mutually orthogonal latin squares is isomorphic to our simplex code construction @xcite in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "we identified a construction relating the hamming distance between @xmath0-ary strings to the hilbert schmidt distance between certain hermitian operators and the fubini - study distance between certain states .",
    "any @xmath0-ary classical code of length up to @xmath214 is suitable and our hope is that the ability to use a vast array of coding - theoretic tools ( distance distributions , automorphisms etc . )",
    "will prove useful in the quantum context .",
    "the types of operators and states that our construction provides are somewhat limited so it is unlikely that our results are directly applicable to outstanding open problems like the existence of symmetric informationally - complete positive operator - valued measures ( sic - povms )",
    ".    one topic for which our results are certainly relevant is the discrete wigner function , where the expectation value of our operators are quasi - probabilities representing quantum states .",
    "the discrete wigner function is both foundationally interesting as well as practically relevant for fault - tolerant quantum computing @xcite .",
    "we showed how a famous family of maximum distance separable codes , the simplex codes , when applied via our construction , reproduce the wigner simplex in hilbert space .",
    "more generally , our results represent a convenient tool for working with , and a novel way of thinking about , wootters wigner function in arbitrary prime - power dimension .",
