    "irc+10216 is a carbon agb star surrounded by a circumstellar envelope ( cse ) of gas and dust .",
    "since it is the nearest agb star of this type and the strongest infrared object in the sky , it has become the paradigm for this kind of sources ( see  [ sec : prevwork ] for more information about previous work ) .",
    "the central star itself can not be observed directly due to the large dust optical depth but the observational data from the cse suggest that it is a physically and chemically rich environment . although this source has been studied many times since its discovery by @xcite , most of these physical and chemical processes remain poorly understood across the envelope ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "the physical conditions in the innermost part of the cse maintain chemical thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "however , the gas could depart from the latter due to the action of periodic shock waves arising from stellar pulsation @xcite . at the temperatures prevailing in these zones",
    ", most atoms are integrated into molecular species , primarily h@xmath2 .",
    "the chemistry is so rich that more than 50% of the molecules known in space were first discovered in this source .",
    "some of these molecules , such as sio @xcite , sis , cs @xcite , and metal - bearing species @xcite , are refractory and are formed in the inner envelope .",
    "as soon as the temperature of the gas is below a critical value these species start to condense and form dust grains .",
    "other species , mainly radicals , display emission from the external shell of the envelope ( @xmath12  mag ) @xcite where the galactic uv field starts to photodissociate the stable molecules formed in the inner cse and neutral - radical reactions produce long carbon chain radicals @xcite and also the interesting gas - phase oxygen chemistry @xcite .",
    "the most abundant molecular species , after h@xmath2 , are co , c@xmath2h@xmath2 , and hcn .",
    "co has an abundance of @xmath13 from 1  r@xmath6 to beyond 1000  r@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "c@xmath2h@xmath2 , is predicted by thermodynamical chemical equilibrium models @xcite to be the most abundant molecule after co and h@xmath2 .",
    "its abundance has been derived to be @xmath14 in the zone @xmath15  r@xmath6 from infrared observations @xcite .",
    "the abundance of hcn @xmath16 has been derived from mid- , far - infrared , and radio observations @xcite .",
    "radiation pressure by stellar photons accelerates the dust grains formed near the star . for the densities prevailing in these dusty regions of the cse ,",
    "the coupling between gas and dust is high and hence the gas is also accelerated @xcite . @xcite",
    "have found that the terminal velocity of the gas is about 14  km  s@xmath1 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is reached before 20  r@xmath6 .",
    "these authors also found that the velocity field seems to have more than one acceleration regime occurring at different places of the inner cse .",
    "these zones might be related to the condensation temperature of different refractory molecular species .",
    "the main goal of this work is to learn more about the physical conditions and chemical composition of the cse of irc+10216 from modeling the line profiles of c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn observed in the mid - infrared with the high - resolution spectrograph texes @xcite .",
    "these observations are presented in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] .",
    "the models we have used to fit the observational data are described in  [ sec : modeling ] and appendices  [ sec : linefrequencies ] and [ sec : lineintensities ] , where we discuss the line identification and give the dipole moment for the different observed vibrational transitions .",
    "the continuum emission is analyzed in ",
    "[ sec : continuum ] .",
    "the results concerning c@xmath2h@xmath2 and its isotopologues are presented in  [ sec : acetylene ] and  [ sec : h13cch ] , and those related to hcn and h@xmath5cn in  [ sec : hcn ] .",
    "the results obtained for c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn , their uncertainties , and the sensitivity of the model to the physical conditions of the cse are discussed and analyzed in  [ sec : sens.disc ] .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we observed irc+10216 with texes , the texas echelon - cross - echelle spectrograph @xcite , at the nasa infrared telescope facility on 2002 dec 12 ( ut ) , corresponding to an ir stellar phase @xmath17 ( following * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we used the texes high resolution echelon grating with a first order grating as the cross - disperser . in this mode",
    ", we obtained a spectral coverage of roughly @xmath18  @xmath0 m per setting . to cover the entire range shown here , 11.6 to 13.9  @xmath0 m",
    ", we required 10 separate settings and stored the data in 10 different files .    at these wavelengths ,",
    "the echelon orders are larger than our detector , meaning that there are gaps in the spectrum between orders .",
    "the gaps increase in size toward longer wavelengths .",
    "telluric features become stronger and more frequent toward 13.9  @xmath0 m . in regions where the telluric atmosphere was nearly opaque ( @xmath195%  transmission ) we discarded the data , resulting in additional gaps .",
    "when using the first order grating as the cross disperser , the texes slit must be very small to prevent orders from overlapping .",
    "for these observations the slit was 2@xmath82 long . with the short slit ,",
    "we nod irc+10216 off the slit for sky subtraction .",
    "sky conditions were good enough that we do not believe this introduced any significant systematics .",
    "the data were reduced with the standard texes pipeline @xcite .",
    "the pipeline corrects optical distortions , combines nod pairs , removes spikes , flatfields , performs correction for telluric absorption , establishes a frequency scale using telluric features , and extracts a spectrum .",
    "we normalized each spectrum before analysis using a fourth - degree polynomial to estimate the baseline .",
    "typically , observations of asteroids provide the best telluric corrections .",
    "however , irc+10216 is so much brighter than the available asteroids that we would have limited our signal - to - noise ratio by using asteroid measurements",
    ". instead , we used a blackbody - sky difference spectrum to correct for the atmosphere .",
    "in the ideal case of the atmosphere , telescope , and blackbody being at a uniform temperature , the difference spectrum indicates the absorption from the sky . in our experience , this procedure for atmospheric correction works fairly well except for telluric water vapor , which can change on a short time scale and from one line of sight to another .",
    "the observed spectrum covers the wavenumber range 720 to 864  cm@xmath1 .",
    "taking into account the molecules detected in this source @xcite , there are several candidates that could contribute to the observed features : c@xmath2h@xmath2 , hcn , and sis , including their isotopologues .",
    "all of them have vibrational bands in the observed wavelength range ( see figures  [ fig : f1]@xmath21[fig : f6 ] ) .",
    "although many lines of sis and other molecules have been identified in the figures , they will be analyzed and studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the spectra was corrected from the source movement by identifying and modeling most of the c@xmath2h@xmath2 @xmath22r@xmath23 and hcn @xmath24r@xmath23 lines in the spectrum , and calculating the mean shift between the observed frequencies and those published from laboratory work @xcite .",
    "this shift is @xmath25  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "however , because of small uncertainties in the observational process , the data in a few files needed for an extra correction smaller than 2  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , we had to correct the central frequency of some c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn bands taken from the @xcite by blue - shifting them in less than 1.5  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "a sample of the velocity - corrected data is shown in table  [ tab : spectrum ] .",

    "the carbonate material condenses and the gas is accelerated again until it reaches a velocity of @xmath73  km  s@xmath1 . @xcite have obtained an inner radius for the condensation of carbonate material of 5  r@xmath6 . at @xmath73",

    "lower values for the terminal turbulence velocity can be found in the literature , e.g. , 0.9  km  s@xmath1 @xcite and 0.65  km  s@xmath1 @xcite .      a good approach to the spectral line radiative transfer problem in a cse is given by the lvg method .",
    "it is very fast and produces good results but assumes that the linewidth of a line is negligible compared to the velocity gradient between very close emitting regions of the cse .",
    "hence , they can not be used to accurately model warm regions like the innermost cse ( @xmath77  k ) where the linewidth can be larger than the expansion velocity gradient .",
    "the most exact model we can develop should be a non - local model which involves both the numerical resolution of the statistical equilibrium and radiative transfer equations .",
    "studies at radio wavelengths have successfully applied this method to cses ( ali codes by , e.g. , @xcite and monte carlo codes by , for example , @xcite ) , although they have needed a significant amount of cpu time even when only a few vibrational and rotational levels have been considered .",
    "nevertheless , the most important reason that led us to reject the use of a non - lte code is the lack of ro - vibrational collisional rates quoted in the literature for c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn . we have identified ro - vibrational lines of c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn involving vibrational levels with energies up to 2200  cm@xmath1 that are created close to the star . in the innermost cse , the kinetic temperature is high enough to significantly populate these vibrational levels having energies between 3000 and 4000  cm@xmath1 or more .",
    "for example , c@xmath2h@xmath2 has about 50 vibrational levels below 4000  cm@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , a thorough model of the envelope should account for many vibrational and rotational states . the large number of ro - vibrational levels to be considered , makes the problem computationally impractical with these kind of methods . we can significantly reduce the computing time by avoiding exact solutions of the statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "we do this by assuming a temperature dependence with radius ( supported by previous work or physical considerations and by allowing several parameters free in order to fit the observed lines .",
    "a reasonably good estimation to the excitation temperatures could be achieved taking advantage of the large number of observed ro - vibrational lines , allowing us to estimate also the populations of many ro - vibrational levels below 2500  cm@xmath1 .",
    "this handmade processing technique accounts for all the physical phenomena having an influence in the molecular level populations at the nearby environment of each position in the envelope , for example , the collisional rates .",
    "concerning the geometry of the envelope , modeling the important deviations from spherical symmetry in the innermost cse requires a large number of parameters which have limited impact in our fits due to the low angular resolution of our observations .",
    "nonetheless , the likely complex velocity field of the gas might introduce some small features in a well defined region of the emission component of the the high - excitation line profiles .",
    "unfortunately , the signal - to - noise ratio is not large enough to unmistakeably identify the signs of the inner structure .",
    "moreover , the envelope approaches spherical geometry at large scales .",
    "therefore we have ignored the complex inner dust structure and assumed spherical symmetry for the whole cse .",
    "these approximations allow us to solve the problem with one dimensional calculations .",
    "we choose a two dimensional coordinate system with the @xmath78 axis parallel to the line of sight pointing away from the earth and the @xmath79 axis perpendicular to @xmath78 in an arbitrary direction .",
    "then , we study the evolution of just one ray of light parallel to @xmath78 for each @xmath79 and build the final spectrum using the symmetry of the envelope . the emerging intensity at each @xmath79 is calculated by summing the emission of each region backwards from the star , so that the radiation emitted by a region is affected by the optical depth of those in the foreground . due to its importance in the mid - ir , dust",
    "is included in the calculations and radiatively coupled to the gas .",
    "the last step is to multiply the emerging intensity by the point spread function ( psf ) of the telescope , take into account the slit dimensions of the spectrometer and to convolve the resultant flux with the frequency response of the detector . by virtue of simplicity , we have adopted a gaussian profile for both the psf and the detector response with the hpbw of the telescope and the width of each channel of the detector as fwhm , respectively .",
    "we have adopted the velocity field structure proposed by @xcite which consists of three different zones : region i starts at the stellar photosphere and ends at the distance of the first dust formation layer , r@xmath80 ; region ii starts at that radius and extends to the position of the second dust formation layer , r@xmath81 ; finally , the rest of the envelope is region iii .",
    "we have initially assumed that the two dust formation regions are located at 5 and 15  r@xmath6 and have a thickness of 1  r@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we allow these values to vary in the model to get the best fit for the dust emission ( continuum of the star ) and the molecular features .",
    "we have divided the envelope into a large number of concentric shells to follow the rapid variation of physical conditions . using a logarithmic step for the radius increment ,",
    "most shells are placed in the inner and middle regions ( regions i and ii ) , where the temperature and density gradients are more important .",
    "we have tried to find some simple laws for the variation of molecular abundances , density , and gas kinetic and dust grain black - body temperatures as a function of @xmath82 that best reproduce the observed continuum and line intensities and profiles .",
    "we have assumed that all the temperatures ( dust , kinetic , vibrational , and rotational ) follow a continuous radial dependence @xmath83 , where @xmath84 could be different for each region of the envelope and for each ro - vibrational level ( @xmath85 ) , depending on the considered temperature . in the case of the dust temperature , we have assumed that @xmath84 remains constant over the whole dusty cse .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 ( for regions i and ii , and for each temperature except the dust temperature ) is completely determined through the input of the corresponding temperature at r@xmath6 and r@xmath80 for region i , and r@xmath80 and r@xmath81 for region ii .",
    "in region i @xmath86 and in region ii @xmath87 , where @xmath79 can be dust , kinetic , vibrational , or rotational .",
    "however , @xmath84 in region iii can not be obtained accurately from a modeling of different lines . in consequence ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath88 for all the temperatures in region iii @xcite .",
    "as we will see below , this hypothesis is compatible with the fits . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas density is assumed to satisfy the continuity equation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the mass of the @xmath92 most abundant species and @xmath93 its abundance with respect to h@xmath2 .",
    "since the most abundant species after h@xmath2 are he and co ( with @xmath94  solar abundance , @xcite  and @xmath13 , respectively ) then , @xmath95 .    for dust grains , we have assumed a static density profile following a @xmath96 variation law : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the optical depth and the absorption of a dust grain at wavelength @xmath100 respectively , @xmath101 is a fixed wavelength and @xmath102 is an input parameter of the model .",
    "the wavelength @xmath101 that we have adopted is @xmath103 m .",
    "the dust opacity is derived from the optical properties of amorphous carbon ( ac ) and silicon carbide ( sic ) at each wavelength and the emission is computed from the dust opacity and temperature in each volume element .",
    "the emission and absorption in an elementary integration step is calculated from the adopted velocity field , the corresponding vibrational and rotational temperatures , the h@xmath2 density and the molecular abundances . for the gas ,",
    "the adopted line frequencies used for the line identification are given in appendix  [ sec : linefrequencies ] , while all the data relevant to line intensities ( opacity , dipole moment , and partition function ) are in appendix  [ sec : lineintensities ] .",
    "the line profile is assumed to be gaussian with a thermal linewidth over the external cse because the dust and the gas are expected to expand at their terminal velocity in a steady flow .",
    "in contrast , the linewidth next to the photosphere has not been well determined by previous observations of irc+10216 .",
    "the matter ejection near the star could increase the microturbulent velocity adding a non - thermal contribution to the linewidth . in our code , this non - thermal contribution has been implemented as @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the non - thermal microturbulent velocity over the photosphere and @xmath106 is a characteristic length ( @xmath82 and @xmath106 are measured in r@xmath6 ) . since the lines affected by temperature and/or microturbulence present gaussian profiles ,",
    "the resultant linewidth is @xmath107 . in order to obtain physically significant parameters from the code ,",
    "the parameter we have used is the total linewidth in the photosphere , @xmath108 .",
    "high energy ro - vibrational lines , which are formed at the photosphere , could carry some information on these parameters .",
    "as many observed lines are modified by many weak features , telluric effects , and overlaps with other lines , the fits derived by the minimization of @xmath109 would be worse than those obtained here .",
    "in addition , the model depends on many parameters and minimizing the @xmath109 function for all the selected lines is computationally unrealistic .",
    "in fact , we were able to obtain reasonably good eye fits which are in agreement with those derived by minimizing the @xmath109 function when diminishing the number of parameters ( as a first approximation ) .",
    "however , in the case of the uncertainties of the parameters ( see  [ sec : sens.disc ] ) , we have used a numerical method .",
    "given an observed line , several parameters could similarly affect the synthetic profile masking their effects and hindering an accurate determination of all their values that reasonably fit the line .",
    "thus , we could calculate the maximum value adopted by a given parameter , by considering it as a function of the others ( having imposed a restriction on the synthetic profile with respect to the observed one ; for example , setting the function @xmath109 to be equal to a given number or forcing the synthetic profile to differ from the observed one in less than a given quantity ) , and by following the gradient of this function .",

    "the fact that the width of the red part of the observed p - cygni profiles is larger than that of the synthetic ones , considering the accepted microturbulence , i.e. , @xmath158  km  s@xmath1 , suggests either more emission from the outer cse only at the back of the star or larger linewidths in the innermost envelope .",
    "the former explanation is in disagreement with the spherical symmetry established by a large number of observations .",
    "the latter seems to be more realistic .",
    "a possible explanation could be an onion - structured region i with shells expanding at positive and negative velocities corresponding to expansion and collapse @xcite .",

    "regarding the decrease of the hcn abundance in r@xmath81 , it might be thought that hcn suffers a depletion onto dust grains . in that case",

    "nevertheless , no significant emission / absorption can be seen in the iso / sws spectrum of irc+10216 at these wavelengths although it is possible that some hcn molecules condense onto dust grains .",
    "however , their contribution to the continuum could be masked by the co vibrational band at 4.67  @xmath0 m . even in that case",
    ", we think that this deposition process does not account for the abundance decay observed at r@xmath81 , which could actually be due to chemical processes .",
    "the most important hcn decrease is produced by photodissociation in the external layers of the cse ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "we have fitted over 300 lines .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows :    1.  the geometrical structure and physical properties of dust and gas over the whole envelope are compatible in many cases with those already proposed . however , the values of certain parameters are quite different . in particular , we find the position of the outer acceleration zone ( @xmath375  r@xmath376 ) to be farther out than found by previous work",

    "the latter result is in accordance with the increase predicted by the chemical models .",
    "contrarily , the derived abundance of hcn grows as radius increases while the chemical models suggest a decay .",
    "in addition , the determined abundances in regions ii and iii allow the condensation of @xmath383 of molecules of c@xmath2h@xmath2 onto the dust grains .",
    "on the other hand , the decrease of the hcn abundance when reaching the outer dust formation zone is probably due to chemical processes .",
    "3.  the vibrational temperatures determined by fitting the lines suggest the existence of a complex pumping mechanism driven by near - ir radiation ( @xmath384  @xmath0 m ) emitted by the star and the inner dusty cse .",
    "high - energy vibrational levels play an important role in the non - lte pumping of low- and mid - energy vibrational states throughout region ii and the edge of region iii through radiative cascades .",
    "reliable modeling using spectroscopic methods of any molecular species in the innermost cse requires an analysis of high - energy vibrational levels at temperatures as high as @xmath385  k.    4.  most of the rotational levels behave as expected : low-@xmath111 rotational levels can be considered to be in lte , while high-@xmath111 ones are not thermalized .",

    "<S> a spectral survey of irc+10216 has been carried out in the range 11 to 14  @xmath0 m with a spectral resolution of about 4  km  s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified a forest of lines in six bands of c@xmath2h@xmath2 involving the vibrational states from the ground to @xmath3 and in two bands of hcn , involving the vibrational states from the ground up to @xmath4 . some of these transitions are observed also in h@xmath5cch and h@xmath5cn . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the kinetic , vibrational , and rotational temperatures , and the abundances and column densities of c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn between 1 and 300 r@xmath6 ( @xmath7  cm ) by fitting about 300 of these ro - vibrational lines . </S>",
    "<S> the envelope can be divided into three regions with approximate boundaries at 0@xmath8019 ( the stellar photosphere ) , 0@xmath81 ( the inner dust formation zone ) , and 0@xmath84 ( outer dust formation zone ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of the lines might require a large microturbulence broadening . </S>",
    "<S> the derived abundances of c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn increase by factors of 10 and 4 , respectively , from the innermost envelope outwards . </S>",
    "<S> the derived column densities for both c@xmath2h@xmath2 and hcn are @xmath9  @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> vibrational states up to 3000  k above ground are populated , suggesting pumping by near - infrared radiation from the star and innermost envelope . </S>",
    "<S> low rotational levels can be considered under lte while those with @xmath11 are not thermalized . </S>",
    "<S> a few lines require special analysis to deal with effects like overlap with lines of other molecules . </S>"
