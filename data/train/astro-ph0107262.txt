    "fundamental limitations of optical and infrared aperture synthesis imaging had been an academic subject in which astronomers were not keenly interested .",
    "the analyses of sensitivities are mathematically rather involved and they appeared in journals of optics ( @xcite ( pk89 ) , @xcite ( nm01 ) ) instead of those in astronomy .",
    "the analyses were academic partly because they dealt with ideal conditions in which atmospheric disturbances did not exist .",
    "therefore their results were applicable only to space interferometers which were instruments in the distant future .",
    "they were also academic partly because optical and infrared interferometers were not considered as routinely used astronomical instruments unlike radio interferometers in radio astronomy .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite ( hereafter rr99 ) , the situation has changed due to the completion of large ground - based telescopes with 8 - 10 m diameters and to the planning of next - generation giant telescopes with 30 - 100 m diameters . in the plans of the giant telescopes , they are all equipped with adaptive optics which deliver diffraction limited images .",
    "the giant telescopes are always useful as optical buckets .",
    "however for the purpose of high resolution imaging , it is not clear whether the synthesized images from an interferometric array of large telescopes or diffraction limited images of giant telescopes are superior . in terms of resolution ,",
    "the interferometric array is obviously advantageous , but in terms of sensitivity or dynamic range the quantitative comparison is more complex .",
    "optical / infrared interferometric arrays with small telescopes currently in operation or being built are dedicated to stellar astronomy . with the advent of an interferometric array composed of large telescopes ,",
    "one essential question is whether interferometry finally has an impact on extragalactic astronomy .",
    "this question is directly related to the limiting magnitude .",
    "the development of the fringe - tracking technique has enabled to cophase a number of telescopes and a ground - based interferometric array can be regarded as an ideal interferometer without atmospheric disturbances .",
    "therefore the sensitivity analyses made for space interferometers in the past can now be applied to ground - based interferometers as well . under these circumstances , it is worthwhile to highlight the results of previous analyses of optical and infrared synthesis imaging in an astronomical journal and apply them to ground - based interferometry composed of large telescopes .",
    "rr99 pioneered the analysis of ground - based interferometry from the point of view of comparison with future giant telescopes .",
    "however their analysis is not of aperture synthesis and as we will show later that their results are not necessarily in agreement with ours . although this paper mostly utilizes previously obtained formulae of signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) in pk89 and nm01 , we also present new results to cover the full parameter space .",
    "the beam combination geometry is a major issue in studying the sensitivity of an interferometer .",
    "one extreme is the @xmath2 interferometer , in which @xmath0 beams are divided into @xmath6 subbeams and they are pairwise combined at @xmath7 detectors .",
    "there is one detector for each baseline .",
    "the other extreme is the @xmath3 interferometer in which all the @xmath0 beams are combined at @xmath8 detector . in this paper",
    ", we present the sensitivities of both interferometers .",
    "we consider idealized interferometers , but the beam - combination scenario for actual interferometers may be more complicated ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 schemes are called pairwise and all - on - one combinations in @xcite .    baseline redundancy is a factor that affects the snr of a synthesis image for a given number of apertures .",
    "since the number of large telescopes combined to form an interferometric array is likely to be limited , it is important to gain @xmath9 coverage by using nonredundant baselines . throughout this paper , we only consider interferometers with nonredundant baselines .",
    "there are two types of noise which appear in aperture synthesis , one of which is removable while the other is intrinsic and not removable .",
    "sampling noise is potentially introduced by the incompleteness of @xmath9 coverage .",
    "however , deconvolution techniques such as clean and maximum entropy method ( mem ) ( @xcite ) , when applied to radio interferometric data , appear to compensate for sampling noise .",
    "we thus regard sampling noise as removable noise . on the other hand ,",
    "noise resulting from the photodetection process is not removable .",
    "the snr of a dirty image to which deconvolution has not been applied is limited by photodetection noise and detector read noise . here",
    "we regard the snr of a dirty image as the snr of the synthesized image .",
    "there are two different methods by which a synthesized image can be constructed from the visibility data : inversion without total counts and true inversion . in the former ,",
    "the zero frequency phasor is neglected , implying that the total number of photons in the synthesized image is zero . despite this seemingly unattractive feature , this is the standard method in radio astronomy . in the latter method ,",
    "the van cittert - zernike theorem is strictly applied and the zero frequency phasor as well as the @xmath1 complex phasors is used .",
    "the image produced by this technique has the desirable property of nonnegativity . in the presence of additive background which overwhelms the signal ,",
    "the magnitude of the zero frequency phasor is much greater than those of other phasors .",
    "the zero frequency phasor determines the dc offset level due to thermal background in the synthesized image .",
    "not only is this background of little astronomical interest , it is also a major source of poisson fluctuations . in this paper , we present the results obtained for both inversion with and without total counts .",
    "however , in practice faint source detection is limited by oh airglow background at j and h and thermal background in the thermal infrared .",
    "so we obtain those detection limits for inversion without total count .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we introduce two types of interferometers , the @xmath2 interferometer and @xmath3 interferometer with expressions for snrs of the images obtained by these interferometers in  2 and  3 .",
    "we discuss limiting cases for spectrally broad light in  4 . in  5 , we present the sensitivities of interferometers composed of nine 10-m telescopes in comparison with a single 30-m telescope with adaptive optics .",
    "we discuss further on the sensitivity analysis in  6 .",
    "let there be @xmath0 identical principal apertures from which we derive @xmath0 main beams .",
    "each beam is divided into @xmath10 subbeams by the use of beam splitters .",
    "the resulting @xmath6 subbeams are combined pairwise at @xmath11 detectors where @xmath12 is also the number of baselines .",
    "the fringe pattern is formed at the focal plane of each detector which is either a one dimensional array of identical pixels or a two dimensional array of identical pixels which range from 1 to @xmath13 ( figure 1 ) . for spectrally broad light , the fringe can be dispersed in the cross fringe direction with the use of a two dimensional detector . for a focal plane interferometer of this type , the influence of source shot noise on fringe phasor estimation has been fully formulated ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let the interferometer be illuminated by a source and spatially smooth background .",

    "in deriving ( [ fpint ] ) , we have assumed that the incident light is spectrally narrow so that the fringe visibility depends on only the spatial correlation of the field .",

    "the temperature of interferometer optics is assumed to be 273 k and the optical throughput is assumed to be 10% . therefore the background emission is estimated from a 273k blackbody with 90% emissivity . for the single telescope with adaptive optics , the throughput of the optics is assumed to be 60% .",
    "the temperature of the optics is assumed to be 273 k , and its emissivity is assumed to be 40% .",

    "this implies that detector read noise is negligible . at 2.2 @xmath4 m ,",

    "longward of 5 @xmath4 m , the single telescope is 5.8 mag more sensitive than the interferometers . at 10.5 @xmath4 m ,",
    "the sensitivities of the interferometers are about 2 mjy or 10.7 mag , while that of the single telescope is 57 @xmath4jy or 14.4 mag . at wavelengths shorter than 2 @xmath4 m",
    ", the baseline length affects the sensitivities of the interferometers due to the change in the number of pixels , while longward of 2 @xmath4 m , it does not matter as long as the source is unresolved . here",
    "we do not consider the case for a fully extended objects . as we have seen from the previous section ,",
    "the interferometers are not sensitive to fully extended objects under background limited conditions .      in the above evaluation of sensitivities",
    ", it is assumed that the throughput of the interferometers is 10% , while that of the single telescope is 60% .",
    "it is natural to question whether the difference in sensitivities is due to that in throughput or something more fundamental .",
    "as discussed by pk89 , there is a basic difference between an interferometer and a single telescope in that the former takes the correlation of signal from multiple apertures .",
    "however the loss of snr by this process is only a factor of @xmath119 in the case of an ideal @xmath2 interferometer with inversion without total count in the source shot noise limit .",
    "a similar situation is expected in the case of background shot noise limit where the number of detector pixels does not affect the snr .",
    "then the only situation in which the difference is conspicuous is the read noise limit where the interferometer requires many more detector pixels to sample fringes .",
    "it is of theoretical interest to assume ideal interferometers and compare their performance with that of the single telescope .",
    "again we compare the interferometers with nine 10-m telescopes and a 30-m single telescope .",
    "since each of the 10-m telescope and the 30-m single telescope require adaptive optics , the throughputs are assumed to be 60% .",
    "the sensitivity limits are plotted in figure 5 , where the difference is about by a factor of five .",
    "therefore the fundamental difference between in the interferometers and the single telescope is rather small and the large difference seen in the previous analysis is due to that in throughput .",
    "the snr expressions of the interferometers are not explicitly baseline dependent .",
    "since the astronomical source is assumed to be unresolved , only the total number of detector pixels is dependent on the lengths of baselines .",
    "detector read noise is more significant as the baselines become longer . in order to use long baselines ,",
    "it is essential to keep detector read noise low so that the snr is not limited by read noise .    for a source of finite extent , long baselines start to resolve it and the visibilities @xmath25 of those baselines decrease from unity and the phases @xmath133 become less coherent depending on the symmetry of the source .",
    "for the extended source , the snrs of the interferometers are calculated as follows .",
    "for a particular baseline configuration , the complex visibilities are obtained by the fourier transform relation ( 4 ) and the number of detector pixels are calculated as above . by inserting those numbers and taking the summation over different baselines , one can obtain the snrs of the dirty images .",
    "one of the motivations of this analysis is to evaluate the capability of interferometry for extragalactic astronomy .",
    "we inevitably have to consider extended objects for this purpose and take into account the guide star availability .",
    "fringe tracking requires the presence of a natural guide star in the infrared .",
    "if the adaptive optics also needs the same natural guide star , the limiting magitude is around r = 15 , and an isoplanatic angle is order of 10@xmath134 at 2 @xmath4 m .",
    "requirements for a natural guide star limit the range of observing targets to bright active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and bright quasars .",
    "the central continuum source of an agn or a quasar will act as a natural guide star and the fringe visibilities are close to unity and phases are close to zero",
    ". therefore snr calculations made in the previous section are applicable to this case .",
    "small deviations in a reconstructed image from a point source indicate the presence of a faint extended structure such as jet .",
    "the 10@xmath5 limiting magnitude of k=25 indicates snr = 10@xmath135 for a k=15 quasar . in other words ,",
    "jet can be searched for with a dynamic range of 10@xmath135:1 .",
    "now we consider resolving broad - line regions ( blrs ) .",
    "according to the photoionization model ( @xcite ) , the size of a blr scales as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the luminosity of the agn . for an agn or a nearby quasar",
    "toward which the geometry is euclidean , the observed flux @xmath138 is given by @xmath139 where @xmath19 is the distance to the object",
    ". then the angular size @xmath140",
    ". therefore the brightest quasar has the largest blr in angular size .",
    "3c273 is the brightest quasar ( k=10 ) and easiest to observe because pa@xmath141 is redshifted to k band .",
    "the necessary spatial resolution is order of 1 milliarcsecond or the necessary baseline length is 400 m. the fwhm of the line is 3400 kms@xmath142 and the line / continuum ratio below 8000 kms@xmath142 is 0.08 ( @xcite ) . in order to obtain the spatial structure of the blr",
    ", we wish to spectrally resolve the broad line or at least separate the blue and red components .",
    "if we require a spectral resolution of 3000 kms@xmath142 , the continuum flux per spectral resolution is k=14 equivalent .",
    "a spectral image will be composed of an unresolved source of k=14 and a resolved source with 8% of the flux of the unresolved source .",
    "again , the complex visibilities are close to those of a point source and the snr argument made above for jet applies to this case as well .",
    "we expect that the blr of 3c273 will be resolved with a dynamic range more than 10@xmath135:1 . at least for agns and quasars , infrared interferometry with large telescopes",
    "appears effective .      in this subsection",
    ", we compare our results with that of rr99 on fizeau - type interferometers or two - dimensional @xmath3 interferometers .",
    "first of all , for spectrally broad light , we have seen that two - dimensional @xmath3 interferometers or fizeau - type interferometers have limitations in the ratio of the telescope aperture diameter and the baseline length to avoid bandwidth smearing .",
    "this is not discussed in rr99 .",
    "second , rr99 states that the @xmath3 interferometer is superior to the @xmath2 interferometer .",
    "however , we have seen from the analysis of limiting cases that the situation is not so simple . as pk89 noted",
    ", there is no major difference in performance between both interferometers in the source shot noise limit .",
    "this is also true with the case for the background limit . in the read noise limit ,",
    "the @xmath62 interferometer is superior to the @xmath2 interferometer due to the difference in the number of detector pixels .",
    "these differences originates from that in the definitions of the snrs .",
    "rr99 defines the snr as that of the central peak in the interferogram directly formed by beam combination . on the other hand",
    ", we define the snr as that of the dirty image formed by aperture synthesis . in the latter ,",
    "the interferogram formed by beam combination is fourier transformed to measure complex visibilities which fill the @xmath9 plane and then they are fourier transformed back to the image plane to form a dirty image . in rr99 ,",
    "the detector pixels of concern at the focal plane are only a few pixels at which the peak is located , while in the latter many pixels which sample the entire interferogram are considered .",
    "we have obtained the sensitivity limits of the interferometers for perfect wavefront correction by adaptive optics and perfect fringe tracking . in reality , both adaptive optics and fringe tracking require a guide star and there is a limitation in the precision of wavefront and delay compensations .",
    "imperfection in phase directly influences the fringe visibility @xmath143 which is proportional to the snrs .",
    "an analysis which takes into account this imperfection in phase is difficult because introduction of atmospheric disturbances opens up a vast parameter space .",
    "our analysis corresponds only to the best case designing .    in this paper , we considered only nonredundant baselines .",
    "however , if we consider a closely packed array of telescopes , we have to take into account the redundancy of the baselines .",
    "although the behavior of snrs are expected to be the same as the nonredundant case , deriving formulae of snrs for the redundant case is non trivial or analytically impossible .",
    "finally one essential and difficult question is whether the definition of the snr as that of the dirty image is valid . in other words ,",
    "we have left out the issue of deconvolution by assuming that it is perfect .",
    "we believe that this is practically of no problem because the snr of the dirty beam is usually much higher than that of the dirty image .",
    "nevertheless deconvolution is a nonlinear process and the error propagation through it is not fully understood .",
    "we present the formulae of snrs of interferometers for the purpose of comparing ground - based interferometers composed of multiple large telescopes with a single giant telescope with adaptive optics . in deriving sensitivity limits ,",
    "perfect wavefront correction by adaptive optics and perfect cophasing by fringe tracking are assumed .",
    "we consider the case in which @xmath0 beams are pairwise combined at @xmath1 detectors ( @xmath2 interferometer ) and the case in which all the @xmath0 beams are combined at a single detector ( @xmath3 interferometer ) .",
    "\\(1 ) in the read noise limit , the @xmath3 interferometer with one dimensional baseline configuration is superior to the @xmath2 interferometer , while in the background limit , the advantage of the @xmath3 interferometer is small .",
    "\\(2 ) we compare the point - source sensitivities of interferometers composed of nine 10-m diameter telescopes and a 30-m diameter single telescope with adaptive optics between 1 and 10 @xmath4 m for 10-@xmath5 detection in one hour . between 1 and 2 @xmath4 m ,",
    "the sensitivities of the interferometers are limited by detector read noise and sky background , while longward of 2 @xmath4 m , they are limited by the instrumental thermal background . at k band ,",
    "the sensitivities of the interferometers are around 23 mag , while that of the single telescope is 27 mag .",
