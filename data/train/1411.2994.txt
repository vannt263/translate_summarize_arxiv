    "the composite fermion ( cf ) formalism offers an elegant explanation for the physics of interacting two - dimensional electron systems ( 2dess ) at very low temperatures in the presence of a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 . in the cf framework , the electron - electron interaction manifests itself through the formation of cfs , quasi - particles resulting from the attachment of an even number of flux quanta to each electron at high @xmath7 @xcite . at even - denominator landau level ( ll ) filling factors , e.g. at @xmath5 and 3/2 , the flux attachment cancels the external field completely , leaving the cfs as if they are at zero effective magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "analogous to their low - field counterparts , near these fillings the cfs occupy a fermi sea with a well - defined fermi contour @xcite .    at @xmath1 , the lower energy spin state of the lowest @xmath9 ll , the @xmath10 state , is fully occupied while its higher energy spin state , @xmath11 , is half filled . in a simple picture",
    ", one might expect the @xmath1 cfs to be fully spin - polarized .",
    "however , the cf spin - polarization depends on the interplay between the coulomb energy @xmath12 , and the zeeman energy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the magnetic length , @xmath15 is the dielectric constant , @xmath16 is the lande @xmath16-factor , @xmath17 is the electron charge , and @xmath18 is the bohr magneton @xcite . when @xmath19 fully dominates over @xmath20 , the cfs can be partially spin - polarized .",
    "this is indeed evidenced by transitions observed between fractional quantum hall states with different spin - polarizations as @xmath21 is varied @xcite . the cf spin - polarization near @xmath1",
    "can also be deduced directly from measurements of the size of the cf fermi wave vector @xmath22 .",
    "however , such experiments have been elusive @xcite . here",
    "we report direct measurements of the @xmath1 cf fermi contour size and shape using commensurability oscillations .",
    "we also deduce the cf spin - polarization and present three models to treat the non - trivial question of the number of cfs in the vicinity of @xmath1 .",
    "we perform @xmath1 cf commensurability measurements in very high - quality 2dess confined to gaas quantum wells ( qws ) of widths @xmath23= @xmath24 to @xmath25 nm . the 2dess have a surface - strain - induced , unidirectional , density modulation . in particular , we monitor , near @xmath1 , the positions of @xmath8 at which we observe magnetoresistance features . associating the features with the commensurability between the majority - spin cf cyclotron orbit and the period of the density modulation , our data are consistent with the cfs occupying a circular fermi sea @xcite .    the positions of the commensurability features are slightly asymmetric in magnetic field with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the asymmetry , best accounted for by a _",
    "minority - density _ model in the @xmath11 ll , in which the cfs are formed by _",
    "electrons _ for @xmath26 and by _ holes _ for @xmath27 , is similar to an asymmetry observed in the commensurability oscillations of @xmath5 cfs @xcite .",
    "it indicates a subtle breaking of the particle - hole equivalence in the ballistic regime of cfs and points to the nontrivial and fundamental question which particles , electrons or holes , pair with flux quanta to form cfs in the vicinity of even - denominator filling factors .",
    "the fermi contour area we deduce from the positions of the commensurability features implies that the @xmath1 cfs degree of spin - polarization depends on the electron density @xmath28 and on the width @xmath23 of the qw in which the cfs are confined . in narrower qws and at low densities ,",
    "the cfs are partially spin - polarized , but at higher densities , or when @xmath29 nm , they reach full spin - polarization .",
    "we explain the @xmath23- and @xmath28-dependence of the degree of cf spin - polarization based on the fact that higher density leads to an increase in @xmath21 and a wider qw reduces @xmath19 . our measurements also reveal that the commensurability features are more pronounced when the cfs are more spin - polarized .",
    "we further apply a magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) parallel to the 2d plane . because of the finite thickness of the electron layer , @xmath4 couples to the carriers out - of - plane orbital motion and severely distorts the @xmath1 cf fermi contour .",
    "remarkably , this @xmath4-induced distortion is much more pronounced compared to the cf fermi contour anisotropy observed near @xmath5 at a comparable @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in addition , thanks to the increasing @xmath20 , which depends on the total magnetic field , the degree of spin - polarization of the cfs increases with @xmath4 .",
    "the 2dess in our samples are confined to symmetric gaas qws grown via molecular beam epitaxy on ( 001 ) gaas substrates .",
    "we studied five samples with qw widths @xmath23 of 30 , 40 , 50 , and 60 nm .",
    "four of the qws are 190 nm under the surface and are flanked on each side by 150-nm - thick , undoped al@xmath30ga@xmath31as barrier ( spacer ) layers and si @xmath32-doped layers . after a brief illumination with a red light emitting diode at low temperatures , the 2d electron densities in these samples are @xmath33 @xmath3 . the fifth sample , another 40-nm - wide qw located 135 nm under the surface with a 95-nm - thick spacer , has @xmath34 @xmath3 .",
    "the mobilities of all samples are @xmath35 @xmath36/vs .",
    "we did experiments in two pumped @xmath37he cryostats with base temperatures @xmath38 k and with either an 18 t superconducting or a 31 t resistive magnet .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath4 was varied by tilting the samples _ in situ _ around @xmath39 $ ] so that @xmath4 was always along the @xmath40 $ ] direction , with @xmath41 denoting the angle between the field direction and the normal to the 2d plane ( see fig",
    ". 1 inset ) . in our measurements",
    "each sample has two perpendicular hall bars , along the @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] directions , covered with periodic gratings of negative electron - beam resist with a period @xmath42 nm ( see fig .",
    "1 inset ) .",
    "the stripes impart strain to the sample surface which , through the piezoelectric effect in gaas , induces a periodic 2des density modulation @xcite . in the presence of an applied @xmath7 , whenever the diameter of the cfs cyclotron orbit becomes commensurate with the period of the density modulation , the sample s resistance exhibits a minimum .",
    "in the cf formalism , away from @xmath1 , the quasi - particles feel an effective magnetic field @xmath8 and undergo cyclotron motion with radius @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the cf fermi wave vector , @xmath45 is the cf density , and @xmath46 is the degree of spin - polarization ( @xmath47 means the cfs are spin - unpolarized and @xmath48 signifies full spin - polarization ) . the magnitude of @xmath8 should depend on the number of electrons in the @xmath11 state , which , in a simple picture , can be approximated by @xmath49 . consequently , the cf density is @xmath50 , and the effective magnetic field experienced by the cfs is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the magnetic field at @xmath1 .",
    "the periodic surface strain in our samples induces a local variation of the cf density @xmath45 which in turn creates a strong local variation of @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the magnetoresistance traces at tilt angle @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) along the two hall bar arms of the 40-nm - wide qw sample with @xmath55 @xmath3 .",
    "they exhibit prominent commensurability features near @xmath56 , including a characteristic , v - shaped , resistance dip , followed by resistance minima on the sides of @xmath1 and flanked by regions of rapidly rising resistance .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively similar to the commensurability features near @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "commensurability features are absent in the trace from the unpatterned region , shown with dashed line in fig",
    ". 1 .    in principle",
    ", periodic variations in both @xmath45 and @xmath8 can trigger commensurability effects of their own .",
    "magnetoresistance minima are thus anticipated when the cyclotron radius @xmath57 of cfs quasi classical orbits satisfies the condition @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a positive integer .",
    "the negative sign denotes the _ electrostatic _ commensurability condition , corresponding to a variation in @xmath45 , while the positive sign implies that the commensurability is _ magnetic _ , i.e. it is related to a periodic modulation of @xmath8 .",
    "previous experiments near @xmath5 reveal excellent agreement between the cf commensurability minima and the _ magnetic _ condition , indicating the cfs there experience a modulated effective field @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , the positions of the resistance minima we observe near @xmath1 agree well with the commensurability condition for cfs with a circular fermi contour in a weak periodic _",
    "magnetic _ field , similar to the @xmath5 cfs . in fig . 1",
    ", two sets of vertical lines , symmetric around @xmath1 , mark the expected positions of the cf commensurability minima based on eq . ( 1 ) applied to a simple picture in which @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath48 and @xmath60 .",
    "the lines closer to @xmath1 correspond to the magnetic condition @xmath61 , and those further away mark the expected electrostatic commensurability minima @xmath62 .",
    "clearly the lines marked with @xmath63 match the observed resistance minima , providing evidence that the data are consistent with the magnetic commensurability condition .",
    "we conclude that in our samples a surface - strain - induced density modulation directly affects @xmath8 near @xmath1 and makes it spatially periodic .",
    "the results of our measurements at @xmath64 are summarized in fig .",
    "2 , where we show one trace from a patterned section for every sample .",
    "the corresponding qw widths and densities are also indicated along with a calculation of the charge distribution in the absence of magnetic field . the density of the top trace , shown in fig .",
    "2 in blue , is significantly higher compared to the other traces . in the vicinity of @xmath1 , each trace exhibits commensurability features .",
    "we mark their positions with vertical arrows .",
    "the features in the @xmath65 nm and the lower - density @xmath66 nm samples ( bottom two traces in fig .",
    "2 ) are rather weak . as the qw width and/or the electron density increase ,",
    "the features develop into pronounced resistivity minima and move outward from @xmath1 .",
    "the positions of the minima are slightly asymmetric with respect to @xmath1 with those on the @xmath67 side being closer to @xmath1 .    in order to quantitatively understand the positions of the commensurability features and their dependence on the qw width and density , we compare them to the expected values based on the commensurability between the quasi - classical orbits of the cfs and the periodic potential modulation ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) with a positive sign ) . for such a comparison",
    ", we need to treat the cf density @xmath45 explicitly in order to predict the @xmath8 values at the commensurability condition . determining the cf density is a non - trivial problem because , away from @xmath1 , the electrons and holes in the @xmath11 ll have unequal densities .",
    "it is similar to an earlier study which revealed an unexpected asymmetry in the positions of the cf commensurability features around @xmath5 , both as a function of field and filling factor @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry there was explained by assuming that the cf density is equal to the density of the minority carriers in the spin - resolved , lowest ll , namely , the cf density was taken to be the density of electrons when @xmath68 but of holes when @xmath69 .",
    "the results near @xmath5 suggest that cfs are formed by pairing of flux quanta with the minority carriers in the lowest ll and further indicate a breaking of the particle - hole symmetry @xcite .    in the present study we consider in detail three density models whose expected",
    "resistance minima positions on the two sides of @xmath1 are summarized in table i. the first cf density model , which we refer to as the `` fixed - density '' model , assumes that cfs have a fixed density , @xmath50 , equal to the electron density in the @xmath11 ll at @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the solution to the magnetic commensurability condition from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , when @xmath60 , is @xmath70 .",
    "the two roots , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are symmetric around @xmath1 and are shown with vertical red lines in fig .",
    "2 . in the second `` minority - density '' model ,",
    "we take into account the variation of the electron density in the @xmath11 ll away from @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that cfs are formed by the _ minority _ carriers in the @xmath11 ll , shaded green in fig .",
    "3 , i.e. by holes for @xmath73 and by electrons for @xmath74 .",
    "hence , the cf density is given by @xmath75n$ ] for @xmath73 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath76n$ ] for @xmath74 ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the solutions to the commensurability condition ( eq . ( 1 ) )",
    "are _ asymmetric _ about @xmath1 ( see table i ) .",
    "they are marked with vertical green lines in fig .",
    "2 . compared to the fixed - density model , the expected minima in this case are closer to @xmath1 .",
    "we also consider a third `` hole - density '' model ( not shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , where the cfs are assumed to be formed by holes in the @xmath11 ll on both sides of @xmath1 .",
    "this model was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to discuss cf commensurability features near @xmath1 . in this model ,",
    "the expected positions of @xmath8 are also asymmetric with respect to @xmath1 ( see table i ) . on the @xmath73 side ,",
    "since holes are the minority carriers in the @xmath11 ll , the solution is exactly the same as in the minority - density model . on the @xmath74 side , however , the expected solution in the hole - density model is at even higher @xmath8 than the fixed cf density solution .",
    "as we discuss later in the context of cf spin - polarization , this model appears inconsistent with our data .",
    "the different cf density models predict positions of @xmath8 which are very close to each other ( fig .",
    "2 ) . since the traces from the narrower qws exhibit only broad commensurability features rather than clear minima , it is difficult to discern which model is most consistent with the experimental data .",
    "the best distinction can be made in the 60-nm qw trace , where there are deep commensurability minima .",
    "the positions of these minima nearly match the spin - polarized marks with @xmath50 .",
    "the agreement with the minority - density model is slightly better compared to the fixed - density model , as the former model captures the observed asymmetry of the minima around @xmath1 .",
    "if cfs are assumed to be formed by holes in the @xmath11 ll ( hole - density model ) , the predicted asymmetry in the expected positions of the commensurability minima would be in the wrong direction , i.e. the features on the @xmath78 are further away than those for @xmath67 ( see table i ) , which is inconsistent with the data .",
    "in general , the traces in fig . 2 show that the positions of the commensurablity minima depend on the qw width and the density .",
    "as @xmath23 decreases , they change from a value nearly consistent with fully spin - polarized cfs to a value suggesting nearly spin - unpolarized cfs .",
    "for example , as @xmath23 decreases from 60 nm to 50 nm , at @xmath79 @xmath3 , the observed minima move closer to @xmath1 . in the 50-nm - qw trace , they are nearly half - way between the two ( solid and dashed ) sets of vertical lines , indicating partial spin - polarization of the cfs .",
    "when @xmath66 nm and @xmath80 @xmath3 , the features are even closer to @xmath1 while for the @xmath65 nm qw ( lowest trace in fig .",
    "2 ) , the cfs appear to be nearly spin - unpolarized as the commensurability features are observed in close proximity to the dashed vertical lines , and certainly far from the solid vertical lines .",
    "in addition to the change in the positions of the commensurability features as @xmath23 varies , we can observe the effect of increasing density . at a fixed qw width , @xmath66 nm ,",
    "but at higher density , @xmath81 @xmath3 , the positions of the resistance features move further away from @xmath1 compared to the lower density @xmath66 nm sample , as expected from eq . ( 1 ) .",
    "more important , the observed features become pronounced resistance minima and their positions are consistent with the predicted positions based on @xmath48 , implying the cfs become more spin - polarized at higher density , as expected .",
    "next , we attempt to quantitatively link the positions of the commensurability features for different qws and electron densities to the cf spin - polarization . the trend is summarized in fig .",
    "4 where we show , for each commensurability feature , the ratio of its _ observed _ position to the _ expected _ position for spin - polarized cfs @xmath82 based on each of the three cf density models ( table i ) . in the fixed - density model , fig .",
    "4(a ) , the data from the @xmath29 nm and the higher density @xmath83 nm samples suggest that the cfs are nearly fully spin - polarized . the @xmath78 side ( solid triangles )",
    "shows a slightly higher degree of spin - polarization which is expected because of the higher total field there . in the minority - density model ,",
    "4(b ) , the cfs in the @xmath29 nm qw and the higher density 40 nm qw are essentially fully spin - polarized , and the difference in the degree of spin - polarization on the two sides of @xmath1 is very small . as we discuss later ,",
    "spin - transition data show that these two samples should exhibit full spin - polarization .",
    "hence , the minority - density model better predicts the positions of the commensurability minima compared to the fixed - density model .",
    "in contrast , if we assume the cfs are formed by holes ( fig .",
    "4 ( c ) ) , the polarization of the @xmath67 side is larger compared to the @xmath78 side .",
    "this is unreasonable since the applied magnetic field at @xmath78 is larger .",
    "if we assume the commensurability features represent the majority - spin carriers , the data from the @xmath84 nm qw suggest a slightly smaller degree of cf spin - polarization compared to the 60-nm - qw ( see figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "data from the narrower wells at density @xmath79 @xmath3 show that the cfs are even less spin - polarized .",
    "the error bars increase with decreasing qw width because the commensurability minima become less well - defined features .",
    "regardless of what density model we use , the cfs become more spin - polarized with increasing well width and electron density . even though the precise treatment of @xmath45 does not change our conclusions on the @xmath23- and @xmath28-dependence of the cf spin - polarization , it reveals subtle differences between the three density models . for the fixed - density and the minority - density models ,",
    "the degree of spin - polarization is always higher for the @xmath78 side , which is expected since the minima there occur at a higher applied field . when @xmath45 is taken to be the density of holes , this trend is reversed , and the cfs on the @xmath67 side appear nearly fully spin - polarized while the degree of spin - polarization on the @xmath78 side is much lower .",
    "this is physically unreasonable since at lower applied field the zeeman energy is lower .",
    "the minority - density model results in a higher degree of spin - polarization on both sides of @xmath1 and further decreases the difference between the two sides .",
    "this is reasonable in light of the fact that the difference in the applied field is @xmath85 t , only about 10% of the total applied field .",
    "we can recast our data in terms of the ratio of the zeeman to the coulomb energies , @xmath21 , which is independent of how we treat the cf density , and compare them to spin - polarization data from the cf spin transition measurements @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "the cf spin transitions , observed as a weakening and strengthening of the fractional quantum hall states around @xmath1 , provide sufficient information to depict the boundary beyond which the cfs are fully spin - polarized @xcite . in fig .",
    "5 , this expected boundary is drawn with solid lines for each qw .",
    "the positions of the lines are interpolated from the spin transition data , reported for @xmath86 and 65 nm qws @xcite .",
    "the symbols in each graph of fig .",
    "5 are the calculated ratios @xmath21 for the positions of the commensurability features / minima we observe on each side of @xmath1 .",
    "the cfs are fully spin - polarized only in the 60 nm and the high density @xmath66 nm qws . for all other samples , they are below the boundary for full spin - polarization .    the plots in fig .",
    "5 agree very well with the spin - polarization deduced from the plot of fig .",
    "4(b ) which assumes a minority - density model for the cfs . in both fig .",
    "4(b ) and fig . 5 ,",
    "the cfs in the 60 nm and the high density @xmath66 nm qws show nearly full spin - polarization ; note that @xmath87 values in fig .",
    "4(b ) for these samples exceed @xmath88 .",
    "the fixed - density and the hole - density models , figs . 4(a ) and ( c ) , on the other hand , predict a somewhat lower degree of spin - polarization .",
    "hence , the comparisons in fig . 5 , which provide an independent check on the cf spin - polarization , further justify the use of the minority - density model for @xmath45 .    the strength of the commensurability features seen in fig .",
    "2 depends on both @xmath23 and @xmath28 .",
    "the higher density 40 nm qw , as well as the 50 nm and 60 nm qws , show pronounced resistance minima .",
    "in contrast , the cf commensurability in the 30 nm and 40 nm qws is signalled only by weak features . this dependence and the sensitivity of our measurements to the majority - spin cf fermi contour @xcite",
    "could also be explained with the degree of cf spin - polarization .",
    "when the cfs are fully or nearly fully spin - polarized , the commensurability minima are well pronounced because there is essentially a single fermi sea with a fermi contour corresponding to cf density @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , in the narrower qws , where the cfs are partially spin - polarized , there are two fermi contours with different sizes which should result in two nearby sets of commensurability features . evidently , our measurements can not resolve such features .",
    "the effect of an in - plane magnetic field @xmath4 on the cf commensurability minima is five  fold .",
    "first , @xmath4 couples to the cfs out - of - plane orbital motion and makes their fermi contours anisotropic .",
    "second , the coupling also changes the charge distribution which in turn affects @xmath19 .",
    "third , @xmath4 increases the degree of cf spin - polarization because it raises @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "forth , when @xmath4 is sufficiently strong , there is a ll crossing between the @xmath11 and @xmath90 lls as the separation between the symmetric and anti - symmetric lls becomes smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "finally , at even higher values of @xmath4 , the system becomes bilayer - like .",
    "we first discuss the change in the positions of the cf commensurability minima as we tilt the sample in magnetic field at an angle @xmath41 , then give an example of a ll crossing at high values of @xmath41 , and quantify the cf fermi contour anisotropy which we later use to draw conclusions about the spin - polarization as a function of the total magnetic field ( see fig .",
    "1 inset for the experimental setup ) .    in the presence of @xmath4 , the cf commensurability minima shift from their @xmath64 positions .",
    "the results for the 40-nm - wide qws are summarized in fig .",
    "6 . in the lower density 40 nm qw ( figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) ) at @xmath64 , the cf commensurability is signaled by weak features rather than minima .",
    "the features fall between the expected values for spin - unpolarized ( dashed green lines ) and those for spin - polarized cfs ( solid green lines ) .",
    "the cfs in the high - density 40-nm - wide qw are essentially fully spin - polarized even at @xmath64 ( bottom traces in figs .",

    "6(a ) and ( c ) . in the @xmath39 $ ] direction , shown in figs .",
    "6(b ) and ( d ) , the relative shift of the resistance minima is toward @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , with increasing @xmath4 , the features in the @xmath91 @xmath3 sample gradually develop into well - defined resistance minima ( figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "we attribute this strengthening to the increase in the cf spin - polarization with tilt , similar to the case of the @xmath23- and @xmath28-dependence of the strength of the features .",
    "the described shifts of the positions of @xmath92 with @xmath4 represent a general trend . in the @xmath93",
    "nm samples , the commensurability features remain well defined minima for a range of tilts and exhibit similar shifts with increasing @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "eventually , at high @xmath41 , the system undergoes a ll crossing which destroys the commensurability features .    in fig .",
    "7 we show an example of a ll crossing which appears at @xmath94 in the 50-nm - qw . the bottom trace in fig .",

    "8 we study the effect of @xmath4 quantitatively in both arms of the l - shaped hall bars .",
    "we summarize the change in the observed positions of the features by normalizing them to the expected values ( @xmath97 ) for fully spin - polarized cfs @xmath82 with @xmath45 equal to the minority - density carriers in the @xmath11 ll and circular fermi contour for each sample ( table i ) . in figs.8(a ) and ( b ) , the normalized values in the two directions are labeled @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] , respectively .",

    "we note that extracting the cf spin - polarization can not be done directly from the data when @xmath4 is finite because the shift is also affected by the @xmath4-induced cf fermi contour anisotropy . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we first discuss the fermi contour anisotropy and then return to the question of spin - polarization .    the evolution of the data points with increasing @xmath4 in fig .",
    "8 provides direct information about the anisotropy of the cf fermi contours . in fig .",

    "the dashed line for the @xmath84 nm qw is interpolated across the ll crossing .",
    "the cf fermi contour distortion is significant for all samples . at low values of @xmath4",
    ", however , the proximity of the different curves and the large error bars make it difficult to extract the exact well - width dependence of the anisotropy . at higher @xmath4",
    "a density dependence emerges in the 40 nm qws : at higher density , @xmath100 @xmath3 , the cf fermi contours are less distorted compared to the @xmath91 @xmath3 case .",
    "this can be understood in terms of a heavier cf effective mass at higher density , as we discuss below .",
    "the @xmath1 fermi contour anisotropy is much stronger than the distortion observed for cfs near @xmath5 at comparable values of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "as we elaborate in the next paragraphs , we attribute this to the smaller cf effective mass near @xmath1 compared to the @xmath5 cfs .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath1 cf fermi contour anisotropy on the cf effective mass and on the finite thickness of the conducting layer can be understood more quantitatively in a simple model , in the spirit of fermi liquid theory @xcite . in this model , which provides an estimate for the expected cf fermi contour anisotropy , an in - plane magnetic field @xmath4 couples",
    "the unbound in - plane motion to the quantized perpendicular motion of the quasi-2d carriers",
    ". we can evaluate its effect by treating @xmath4 in lowest - order perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the model also assumes a parabolic dispersion with effective mass @xmath101 for the in - plane motion and subband levels @xmath102 for the quantized perpendicular motion in a qw of width @xmath23 and out - of - plane mass @xmath103 .",
    "assuming fully spin - polarized electrons , this yields an elliptic fermi contour with minor and major radii @xcite : @xmath104 this perturbative expansion in @xmath4 is valid as long as the distortion of the fermi contour described by the second term in the round brackets remains small . here",
    "we may expect that the physics of cfs characterizes the in - plane dynamics of the quasi - particles in our experiments , implying @xmath101 should be approximately the effective mass of cfs that contains electron - electron interactions .",
    "the quantized perpendicular motion of the quasi - particles giving rise to the formation of electric subbands should reflect , on the other hand , the band dynamics which is characterized by the band mass of electrons in gaas @xcite .",
    "the cf effective mass @xmath105 is in general very different from the electron band effective mass in gaas , @xmath106 ( in units of the free - electron mass ) , and depends on interaction which increases as @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "near @xmath5 , for example , @xmath105 is measured to be @xmath108 at @xmath109 t @xcite , while in the same sample the measured @xmath105 for cfs near @xmath1 at @xmath110 t is @xmath111 @xcite .    in light of its dependence on @xmath112 and qw width , the theoretical model based on eq .",
    "( 2 ) has three qualitative implications for the fermi contour anisotropy of the various particles in our measurements .",
    "first , it predicts that , for a given sample and density , the electrons near @xmath113 would exhibit the highest fermi contour anisotropy because they have the smallest @xmath112 while the @xmath5 cfs would show the least anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy for the @xmath1 cfs would be smaller than the anisotropy for electrons but larger than that of the @xmath5 cfs .",
    "this is indeed the qualitative trend seen in our results .",
    "for example , for the 40-nm - wide qw sample with density @xmath114 @xmath3 and at @xmath115 t , the anisotropy is @xmath116 for electrons @xcite , @xmath117 for @xmath1 cfs ( black curve in fig .",
    "9(a ) ) , and only about 1.1 for @xmath5 cfs @xcite ( also see the dashed gray curve in fig .",
    "second , the model of eq . ( 1 ) predicts a qw - width dependence , which is also qualitatively observed : wider qws show larger cf fermi contour anisotropy .",
    "third , the model explains the density dependence of the data for the two @xmath66 qw samples .",
    "in particular , @xmath118 implies a larger @xmath105 at higher density , resulting in a smaller cf fermi anisotropy as seen in fig .",
    "we emphasize that we only see a qualitative agreement between the trends predicted by eq .",
    "( 2 ) and those observed experimentally ; this is not surprising since the model is only perturbative and not rigorous .    as mentioned above , another consequence of the application of @xmath4",
    "is the enhancement of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath19 and the increase in the degree of cf spin - polarization .",
    "to quantitatively assess the change in the cf spin - polarization , we plot in fig .",
    "9(b ) the normalized product of the observed field positions of the cf commensurability resistance minima ( @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] ) as a function of total magnetic field @xmath119 .",
    "the cf density is taken to be the minority - density .",
    "the dashed section of the 50-nm qw trace represents the ll crossing region in figs . 7 and 8",
    ". we also show , with a dashed black curve , the @xmath5 data from the @xmath66 nm qw with @xmath91 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the cfs in our @xmath5 study are fully spin - polarized so the @xmath5 data appear as a nearly flat line ( see dashed black curve in fig .",
    "9(b ) ) , which in turn allows us to conclude that the cf fermi contours remain elliptical even at high values of @xmath4 . assuming the @xmath1 cf fermi contours also remain nearly elliptical , fig .",
    "9(b ) is effectively a plot of the cf spin - polarization @xcite .",
    "indeed , all samples except for the lower - density @xmath66 nm qw appear to reach full spin - polarization .",
    "however , the apparent spin - polarization in the lower - density @xmath66 nm sample remains surprisingly small .",
    "even at @xmath120 t , the cfs there are still partially spin - polarized which is not consistent with the other samples .",
    "it is likely that because of the significant anisotropy at high @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "9(a ) ) , the cf fermi contour is no longer elliptical which prevents use from accurately determining the cf spin - polarization from a plot like the one in fig .",
    "in summary , we observe pronounced commensurability minima in the vicinity of @xmath1 . their positions with respect to the field at @xmath1 are slightly asymmetric .",
    "the presence of this asymmetry necessitates the proper treatment of the cf density @xmath45 and reveals that the cfs near @xmath1 are likely formed by the minority carriers in the @xmath11 ll , in agreement with the observations for @xmath5 @xcite . by deducing the size of the cf fermi wave vector , we find that the cf spin - polarization depends on the qw width and the electron density .",
    "we attribute this dependence to the change in the ratio @xmath21 of the zeeman and coulomb energies : @xmath19 decreases with increasing layer thickness as the coulomb interaction softens , while @xmath20 is enhanced at higher densities with respect to @xmath19 . in the presence of @xmath4 ,",
    "the cf fermi contours become distorted and the cf spin - polarization increases . qualitatively ,",
    "the @xmath4-induced cf fermi contour anisotropy seen near @xmath1 is larger than the distortions observed near @xmath5 because of the smaller cf in - plane mass near @xmath1 .",
    "quantitatively , however , the @xmath1 cf fermi contour distortion is stronger than our expectations based on a simple perturbative model .",
    "we hope our experimental results would stimulate a more rigorous theoretical treatment of the cf fermi contour anisotropy .",
