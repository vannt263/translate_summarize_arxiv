    "in spite of an unprecedentedly intensive experimental and theoretical study after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in cuprates there is , even twenty - two years after , no consensus on the pairing mechanism in these materials . at present",
    "there are two important experimental facts which are not under dispute : ( 1 ) the critical temperature @xmath3 in cuprates is high , with the maximum @xmath4 @xmath5 ; ( 2 ) the pairing in cuprates is d - wave like , i.e. @xmath6 with @xmath7 . on the contrary",
    "there is a dispute concerning the scattering mechanism which governs normal state properties and pairing in cuprates . to this end",
    ", we stress that in the htsc cuprates , a number of properties can be satisfactorily explained by assuming that the quasi - particle dynamics is governed by some electron - boson scattering and in the superconducting state bosonic quasi - particles are gluing electrons in cooper pairs . which bosonic quasi - particles are dominating in the cuprates is the subject which will be discussed in this work . it is known that the electron - boson ( phonon ) scattering is well described by the migdal - eliashberg theory if the adiabatic parameter @xmath8 @xmath9 fulfills the condition @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the electron - boson coupling constant , @xmath12 is the characteristic bosonic energy and @xmath13 is the electronic band width .",
    "the important characteristic of the electron - boson scattering is the eliashberg spectral function @xmath14 ( or its average @xmath1 ) which characterizes scattering of quasi - particle from @xmath15 to @xmath16 by exchanging bosonic energy @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , in systems with electron - boson scattering the knowledge of this function is of crucial importance .",
    "there are at least two approaches differing in assumed gluing bosons . the first one is based on the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where mediating bosons are _ phonons _ and where the the average spectral function @xmath1 is similar to the phonon density of states @xmath18 .",
    "note , @xmath1 is not the product of two functions although sometimes one defines the function @xmath19 which should approximate the energy dependence of the strength of the epi coupling .",
    "there are numerous experimental evidence in cuprates which support the dominance of the epi scattering mechanism with a rather large coupling constant @xmath20 and which will be discussed in detail below . in the epi approach @xmath1",
    "is extracted from tunnelling measurements in conjunction with ir optical measurements .",
    "we stress again that the migdal - eliashberg theory is well justified framework for epi since in most superconductors the condition @xmath21 is fulfilled .",
    "the htsc are on the borderline and it is a natural question - under which condition can high t@xmath22 be realized in the non - adiabatic limit @xmath23 ?",
    "the second approach @xcite assumes that epi is too weak to be responsible for high @xmath3 in cuprates and it is based on a phenomenological model for spin - fluctuation interaction ( @xmath24 ) as the dominating scattering mechanism , i.e. it is a non - phononic mechanism . in this approach",
    "the spectral function is proportional to the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "nmr spectroscopy and magnetic neutron scattering give that in htsc cuprates @xmath27 is peaked at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath28 and this property is favorable for d - wave pairing .",
    "the @xmath24 theory roots basically on the strong electronic repulsion on cu atoms , which is usually studied by the hubbard model or its ( more popular ) derivative the t - j model . regarding the possibility to explain high t@xmath22 solely by strong correlations , as it is reviewed in @xcite",
    ", we stress two facts .",
    "first , at present there is no viable theory which can justify these ( non - phononic ) mechanisms of pairing .",
    "second , the central question in this approach is - do models based on the hubbard hamiltonian show up superconductivity at sufficiently high critical temperatures ( @xmath29 @xmath5 ) ?",
    "a number of numerical studies of these models offer a negative answer .",
    "for instance , the sign - free variational monte carlo algorithm in the 2d repulsive ( @xmath30 ) hubbard model gives no evidence for htsc , neither the bcs- nor berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt)-like @xcite . at the same time ,",
    "similar calculations show that there is a strong tendency to superconductivity in the attractive ( @xmath31 ) hubbard model for the same strength of @xmath32 , i.e. at finite temperature in the 2d model with @xmath31 the bkt superconducting transition is favored .",
    "concerning htsc in the @xmath33 model , various numerical calculations such as monte carlo calculations of the drude spectral weight @xcite and high temperature expansion @xcite have shown that there is no superconductivity at temperatures characteristic for cuprates and if it exists @xmath3 must be rather low - few kelvins .",
    "these numerical results tell us that the lack of high @xmath3  ( even in @xmath34  bkt phase ) in the repulsive ( @xmath30)single - band hubbard model and in the @xmath33 model is not only due to thermodynamical @xmath34-fluctuations ( which at finite t suppress and destroy superconducting phase coherence in large systems ) but it is mostly due to an _ inherent ineffectiveness of strong correlations to produce solely high _",
    "@xmath3 _ in cuprates_. these numerical results certainly mean that the simple single - band hubbard , as well as its derivative the t - j model , are insufficient to explain the pairing mechanism in cuprates and some other ingredients must be included .",
    "having in mind these facts there is no room at present for any kind of celebration of the victory of non - phononic mechanisms of pairing as some prefer to do .",
    "since @xmath35 is as a rule strong in oxides , then it is plausible that it should be accounted for in cuprates at least in the normal metallic state .",
    "as it will be argued later on , the experimental support for the importance of epi comes from optics , tunnelling , and recent arpes measurements @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recent arpes activity was a strong impetus for renewed experimental and theoretical studies of epi in cuprates .",
    "however , in spite of accumulating experimental evidence for importance of epi with @xmath36 , there are occasionally reports which doubt its importance in cuprates .",
    "this is the case with recent interpretation of some optical measurements in terms of sfi only @xcite and with lda band structure calculations @xcite , @xcite , where both claim that epi is negligibly small , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "there are two parts - in _",
    "part i _ we will mainly discuss experimental results in _ cuprates near optimal doping _ and minimal theoretical explanations which are related to the spectral function @xmath1 as well to the transport spectral function @xmath38 and how these are related to epi in cuprates . in this work",
    "we consider mainly those direct one - particle and two - particles probes of low energy quasi - particle excitations ( by including gap and pseudogap ) and scattering rates which give informations on the structure of the spectral functions @xmath39 and @xmath38 in systems near optimal doping .",
    "these are angle - resolved photoemission ( @xmath40 ) , various arts of tunnelling spectroscopies such as superconductor / insulator/ normal metal ( @xmath41 ) junctions and break junctions , scanning - tunnelling microscope spectroscopy ( @xmath42 ) , infrared ( @xmath43 ) and raman optics , inelastic neutron scattering ( @xmath44 ) etc .",
    "we shall argue that these direct probes give evidence for a rather strong epi in cuprates as dominating scattering mechanism of quasi - particles .",
    "some other experiments on epi are also discussed in order to complete the arguments for the importance of epi in cuprates .",
    "the detailed contents of part i is the following . in _ section ii",
    "_ we discuss some prejudices related to @xmath35 and the fermi - liquid behavior of htsc cuprates .",
    "we argue that any non - phononic mechanism of pairing should have very large bare critical temperature @xmath45 in the presence of the large epi coupling constant , @xmath46 , if its spectral function is weakly momentum dependent , i.e. if @xmath47 .",
    "the fact that epi is large in the normal state of cuprates and the condition that it must conform with d - wave pairing implies inevitably that epi in cuprates must be _ strongly momentum dependent_. in _ section iii _ we discuss direct and indirect experimental evidence for the importance of epi and for the weakness of sfi in cuprates .",
    "these are :    ( * a * ) _ magnetic neutron scattering _ _",
    "measurements - _ these measurements provide dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath48 which is in the @xmath24 phenomenological approach @xcite related to the eliashberg spectral function , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "we stress that such an approach can be qualitatively justified only in the weak coupling limit , @xmath50 , where @xmath13 is the band width . here",
    "we discuss experimental results which give evidence for strong rearrangement ( with respect to @xmath17 ) of @xmath51 by doping toward the optimal doped htsc @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in the optimally doped cuprates with @xmath52 @xmath5 @xmath53 is drastically suppressed compared to that in slightly underdoped ones with @xmath54 @xmath5 , and this is strong evidence for the smallness of the sfi coupling constant .    *",
    "( _ b _ ) * _ optical conductivity _",
    "_ measurements _ - from these measurements one can extract the transport relaxation rate @xmath55 and indirectly an approximative shape of the transport spectral function @xmath56 . in that respect we discuss : ( i ) the misleading concept concerning the relation between the optical relaxation rate @xmath57 and the quasi - particle relaxation rate @xmath58 .",
    "this ( misleading ) concept has been appearing repeatedly in the last twenty years despite the fact that this controversy is resolved many years ago @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; ( ii ) some methods of extraction of the optical spectral function @xmath59 from optical reflectivity measurements .",
    "it turns out that the width and the shape of the extracted @xmath38 favor epi ; ( iii ) the restricted sum - rule for the optical weight as a function of temperature which can also be explained by strong @xmath35 @xcite , @xcite ; ( iv ) good agreement with experiments of the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath60 calculated with the extracted @xmath38 .",
    "recent femtosecond time - resolved optical spectroscopy in @xmath61 gives additional evidence for importance of epi and ineffectiveness of sfi @xcite .    * ( _ c _ ) * _ arpes _ _ measurements and epi _ - from these measurements one can extract the self - energy @xmath62 from which one can extract some properties of @xmath63 .",
    "here we discuss the following items : ( i ) appearance of the nodal and anti - nodal kinks in optimally and slightly underdoped cuprates , as well as the structure of the arpes self - energy ( @xmath64 ) and its isotope dependence , which are all due to epi ; ( ii ) appearance of different slopes of @xmath65 at low ( @xmath66 ) and high energies ( @xmath67 ) which can be explained with strong epi ; ( iii ) formation of small polarons in the undoped htsc which is due to strong epi - this gives rise to phonon side bands which are clearly seen in arpes of undoped htsc .",
    "( * d * ) _ tunnelling spectroscopy - _ it is well known that this method is of an immense importance in obtaining the spectral function @xmath68 from tunnelling conductance . in this part",
    "we discuss the following items : ( i ) extraction of the eliashberg spectral function @xmath68 with @xmath69 from the tunnelling conductance of break - junctions @xcite-@xcite which gives that the maxima of @xmath1 coincide with the maxima in the phonon density of states ; ( ii ) the presence of the dip in di / dv in stm which shows the pronounced oxygen isotope effect and important role of these phonons : ( iii ) the presence of fine and doping independent structure in i(v ) characteristics due to phonon emission by the josephson current in layered htsc cuprates with intrinsic josephson junctions .    *",
    "( _ e _ ) * _ phonon _ _ neutron scattering _ _ measurements _ - from these experiments one can extract the phonon density of state @xmath18 and strengths of the quasi - particle coupling with various phonon modes . here",
    "we argue , that the large softening and broadening of the half - breathing cu - o bond - stretching phonon , of apical oxygen phonons and of oxygen @xmath70 buckling phonons ( in lsco , bisco , ybco ) can not be explained by lda .",
    "it is curious that the magnitude of softening can be partially obtained by lda but the calculated widths of some important modes are an order of magnitude smaller than the neutron scattering data show .",
    "this remarkable fact implies _ the _ _ inadequacy of lda in strongly correlated systems _ and a more sophisticated many body theory for epi is needed .",
    "this problem will be discussed in more details in _ part ii _ @xcite . in _ section iv _",
    "brief summary of the _",
    "part i _ is given .",
    "since _ we are dealing with electron - boson scattering in cuprate near optimal doping _",
    ", then in _ section v _ - appendix we introduce the reader briefly into the migdal - eliashberg theory for superconductors ( and normal metals ) where the quasi - particle spectral function @xmath14 and the transport spectral function @xmath38 are defined .",
    "finally , at the end of the day one poses a question - do the experimental results of the above enumerated spectroscopic methods allow a building of a satisfactory and physically reasonable microscopic theory for basic scattering and pairing mechanism in cuprates ?",
    "the posed question is very modest compared with a much stringent request for the _ theory of everything _ - which would be able to explain all properties of htsc materials .",
    "such an ambitious project is not realized even in those low - temperature conventional superconductors where it is definitely proved that the pairing is due to epi and many properties are well accounted for by the migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "let us mention only two examples .",
    "first , the experimental value for the coherence peak in the microwave response @xmath71 at @xmath72 @xmath73 in @xmath74 is much higher than the theoretical value obtained by the migdal - eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "so to say , the theory explains the coherence peak at @xmath72 @xmath73 in @xmath74 qualitatively but not quantitatively . however , the measurements at higher frequency @xmath75 @xmath73 are in agreement with the migdal - eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "second , the experimental boron ( b ) isotope effect in @xmath76 ( with @xmath77 @xmath5 ) is much smaller than the theoretical value , i.e. @xmath78 , although the pairing is due solely by epi for boron vibrations @xcite . since the theory of everything is impossible in the complex materials such as htsc cuprates in",
    "part i _ and _ ii _ we shall not discuss those phenomena which need much more microscopic details and/or more sophisticated many - body theory .",
    "these are selected by chance : ( i ) peculiarities of the coherence peak in the microwave response @xmath79 in htsc cuprates , which is peaked at @xmath80 much smaller than @xmath3 , contrary to the case of ltsc where it occurs near @xmath3 ; ( ii ) @xmath3 dependence on the number of @xmath81 in the unit cell ; ( iii ) temperature dependence of the hall coefficient ; ( iv ) distribution of states in the vortex core , etc . however , in a separate paper - _ part ii _ @xcite we shall discuss some minimal theoretical concepts which can explain at least qualitatively and semi - quantitatively results related to the above enumerated spectroscopic methods . due to the presence of strong correlations and quasi-2d electronic structure",
    "some of these concepts go beyond the lda approach . in our opinion at this stage of the htsc physics some _ important ingredients _ of the future theory are already recognized .",
    "these are : ( 1 ) very peculiar quasi-2d ionic - metallic structure with a rather weak screening along the c - axis , which is a prerequisite for strong epi ; ( 2 ) strong coulomb interaction and correlations which are responsible for strong magnetism in undoped cuprates and for important renormalizations of epi .",
    "since both ingredients belong to the class of strong coupling problems , at present there is no quantitative theory and therefore we must rely on approximative and model theories .",
    "even these approaches allow us qualitative ( and semi - quantitative ) explanations of some important properties which are due to the interplay of epi and strong correlations .",
    "the latter two cause the appearance of momentum dependent epi - peaked at small transfer momenta @xcite .",
    "based on such an approach we are able to explain ( understand ) at least qualitatively some very puzzling experimental results , for instance : * * ( * * _ _ a ) _ _ why is d - wave pairing realized in the presence of strong epi ? * * ( * * _ _ b _ _ * ) * why is the transport coupling constant ( @xmath82 ) smaller than the pairing one @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath83 ? ( _ c _ ) why is the mean - field ( one - body ) lda approach unable to give reliable values for the epi coupling constant in cuprates and how many - body effects help ; ( _ d _ ) why is d - wave pairing robust in presence of non - magnetic impurities and defects ? ( e ) why the arpes nodal and antinodal kinks are differently renormalized in the superconducting states ?    in real materials there are numerous experimental evidence for nanoscale inhomogeneities in htsc oxides .",
    "for instance recent stm experiments show rather large gap dispersion at least on the surface of bisco crystals @xcite giving rise for a pronounced inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter , i.e. @xmath84 where @xmath15 is the relative momentum of the cooper pair and @xmath85 is the center of mass of cooper pairs .",
    "one possible reason for the inhomogeneity of @xmath86 and disorder on the atomic scale can be due to extremely high doping level of @xmath87 @xmath88 in htsc cuprates which is many orders of magnitude larger than in standard semiconductors ( @xmath89 vs @xmath90 carrier concentration ) .",
    "there are some claims that high @xmath3 is exclusively due to these inhomogeneities ( of an extrinsic or intrinsic origin ) which may increase epi @xcite , while other try to explain high @xmath3 within the inhomogeneous hubbard or t - j model . in _ part ii _",
    "@xcite we argue that the concept of an increase of t@xmath22 by inhomogeneity is ill - defined , since the increase of @xmath3 is defined with respect to the average value @xmath91 .",
    "however , the latter quantity is experimentally not well defined and an alleged increase of @xmath3 by the material inhomogeneity can not be tested at all .",
    "concerning the high @xmath3 in cuprates , one of the central questions is - which interaction(s ) is(are ) responsible for strong quasi - particle scattering in the normal state and for the superconducting pairing ? in the last twenty - two years , the scientific community was overwhelmed by all kinds of ( im)possible proposed pairing mechanisms , most of which are hardly verifiable in any material , if at all .",
    "this trend is still continuing nowadays ( although with smaller slope ) , in spite of the fact that the accumulated experimental results eliminate all but few .    _",
    "a. fermi vs non - fermi liquid in cuprates _",
    "after discovery of htsc in cuprates there was a large amount of evidence on strong scattering of quasi - particles which contradicts the canonical ( popular but narrow ) definition of the fermi liquid , thus giving rise to numerous proposals of the so called non - fermi liquids , such as luttinger liquid , rvb theory , marginal fermi liquid , etc . in our opinion there is no need for these radical approaches in explaining basic physics in cuprates at least in optimally , slightly underdoped and overdoped metallic and superconducting htsc cuprates .",
    "this subject will be discussed more in _ part ii _ and here we give some clarifications related to the dilemma of fermi vs non - fermi liquid .",
    "the definition of the _ canonical fermi liquid _ ( based on the landau work ) in interacting fermi systems comprises the following properties : ( 1 ) there are quasi - particles with charge @xmath92 , spin @xmath93 and low - laying energy excitations @xmath94 which are much larger than their inverse life - times , i.e. @xmath95 .",
    "since the level width @xmath96 of the quasi - particle is negligibly small , this means that the excited states of the fermi liquid are placed in one - to - one correspondence with the excited states of the free fermi gas ; ( 2 ) at @xmath97 @xmath5 there is an energy level with the fermi surface at which @xmath98 and the fermi quasi - particle distribution function @xmath99 has finite jump ; ( 3 ) the number of quasi - particles under the fermi surface is equal to the total number of conduction particles ( we omit here other valence and core electrons ) - the luttinger theorem ; ( 4 ) the interaction between quasi - particles are characterized with a few ( landau ) parameters which describe low - temperature thermodynamics and transport properties . having this definition in mind one can say that if fermionic quasi - particles interact with some bosonic excitation ( for instance with phonons ) and if the coupling is sufficiently strong , then the former are not described by the canonical fermi liquid since at energies and temperatures of the order of the debay temperature @xmath100 ( more precisely @xmath101 ) , i.e. for @xmath102 one has @xmath103 and the quasi - particle picture ( in the sense of the landau definition ) is broken down . in that respect",
    "an electron - boson system can be classified as a _ non - canonical fermi liquid _ for sufficiently strong electron - boson coupling .",
    "it is nowadays well known that for instance al , zn are weak coupling systems since for @xmath102 one has @xmath104 and they are well described by the landau theory .",
    "however , the electron - phonon system is satisfactory described by the migdal - eliashberg theory and the boltzmann theory , where thermodynamic and transport properties depend on the spectral function @xmath105 and its higher momenta . since in htsc",
    "cuprates the electron - boson ( phonon ) coupling is rather strong and @xmath3 is large , i.e. of the order of characteristic boson energies ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath106 , then it is natural that in the normal state ( at @xmath107 @xmath3 ) we deal inevitably with a strong interacting non - canonical fermi liquid which is at least qualitatively and semi - quantitatively described by the migdal - eliashberg theory . in order to justify this statement we shall in the following",
    "elucidate some properties in more details by studying optical , arpes , tunnelling and other experiments .",
    "prejudice on the limitation of the strength of epi _    in spite of reach experimental evidence in favor of strong epi in htsc oxides there was a disproportion in the research activity ( especially theoretical ) in the past , since the investigation of the sfi mechanism of pairing prevailed in the literature .",
    "this retrograde trend was partly due to an incorrect statement in @xcite on the possible upper limit of t@xmath22 in the phonon mechanism of pairing .",
    "since in the past we have discussed this problem thoroughly in numerous papers - for the recent one see @xcite , we shall outline here the main issue and results only .",
    "it is well known that in an electron - ion crystal , besides the attractive epi , there is also repulsive coulomb interaction . in case of an isotropic and homogeneous system with weak quasi - particle interaction ,",
    "the effective potential @xmath108 in the leading approximation looks like as for two external charges ( @xmath109 ) embedded in the medium with the _ total longitudinal dielectric function _",
    "@xmath110 ( @xmath15 is the momentum and @xmath17 is the frequency ) @xcite , i.e. @xmath111 in case of strong interaction between quasi - particles , the state of embedded quasi - particles changes significantly due to interaction with other quasi - particles , giving rise to @xmath112 . in that case @xmath113 depends on other ( than @xmath114 ) response functions .",
    "however , in the case when eq.([veff ] ) holds , i. e. when the weak - coupling limit is realized , @xmath3 is given by @xmath115 @xcite , @xcite@xmath116 .",
    "here , @xmath117 is the epi coupling constant , @xmath118 is an average phonon frequency and @xmath119 is the coulomb pseudo - potential , @xmath120 ( @xmath121 is the fermi energy ) .",
    "the couplings @xmath117 and @xmath122 are expressed by @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the density of states at the fermi surface and @xmath127 is the fermi momentum - see more in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was claimed that lattice stability of the system with respect to the charge density wave formation implies the condition @xmath128 for all @xmath15 . if this was correct then from eq.([nveff ] ) it follows that @xmath129 , which limits the maximal value of t@xmath22 to the value @xmath130 . in typical metals",
    "@xmath131 @xmath132 and if one accepts the statement in @xcite , i.e. that @xmath133 , one obtains @xmath134 @xmath5 .  the latter result , if it would be true , means that epi is ineffective in producing not only high - t@xmath22 superconductivity but also low - temperature superconductivity ( lts ) . however , this result is apparently in conflict first of all with experimental results in ltsc , where in numerous systems @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "for instance , @xmath137 is realized in @xmath138 alloy which is definitely much higher than @xmath139 .    moreover , the basic theory tells us that @xmath140 is not the response function @xcite .",
    "namely , if a small external potential @xmath141 is applied to the system it induces screening by charges of the medium and the total potential is given by @xmath142 which means that @xmath143 is the response function .",
    "the latter obeys the kramers - kronig dispersion relation which implies the following stability condition : @xmath144 for @xmath145 , i.e. either @xmath146 or @xmath147 .",
    "this important theorem invalidates the above * *  * * restriction on the maximal value of t@xmath22 in the epi mechanism . we stress that the condition @xmath148 is not in conflict with the lattice instability .",
    "for instance , in inhomogeneous systems such as crystal , the total longitudinal dielectric function is matrix in the space of reciprocal lattice vectors ( @xmath149 ) , i.e. @xmath150 , and @xmath151 is defined by @xmath152 .",
    "it is well known that in dense metallic systems with one ion per cell ( such as metallic hydrogen ) and with the electronic dielectric function @xmath153 , one has @xcite @xmath154 at the same time the frequency of the longitudinal phonon @xmath155 is given by @xmath156 ,   \\label{ph - fr}\\ ] ] where @xmath157 is the ionic plasma frequency , @xmath158 is the local ( electric ) field correction - see ref .",
    "the real condition for lattice stability requires that @xmath159 , which implies that for @xmath160 one has @xmath161 .",
    "the latter condition gives automatically @xmath162 .",
    "furthermore , the calculations @xcite show that in the metallic hydrogen crystal , @xmath163 for all @xmath164 .",
    "moreover , the analyzes of crystals with more ions per unit cell @xcite gives that @xmath165 is _ more a rule than an exception _ - see fig .",
    "[ epsilon - k ] .",
    "the physical reason for @xmath166 are local field effects described above by @xmath167",
    ". whenever the local electric field @xmath168 acting on electrons ( and ions ) is different from the average electric field @xmath169 , i.e. @xmath170 , there are corrections to @xmath171 ( and to @xmath172 ) which may lead to @xmath162 .",
    "the above analysis tells us that in real crystals @xmath173 can be negative in the large portion of the brillouin zone giving rise to @xmath174 in eq.([nveff ] ) .",
    "this means that the dielectric function @xmath175 _ does not limit _",
    "_  in the phonon mechanism of pairing__.",
    "this result does not mean that there is no limit on t@xmath22 at all - see more in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we mention in advance that the local field effects play important role in htsc oxides , due to their layered structure with very _ unusual ionic - metallic binding _ , thus giving rise to large @xmath35 - see more in the subsequent sections .",
    "it is pertinent to note that one of the author of @xcite recognizes the possibility @xmath162 and in @xcite even makes interesting proposals for compounds with large epi and @xmath176 @xmath5 , while the other author @xcite still ignores rigors of scientific arguments and negates importance of epi in htsc cuprates .    in conclusion",
    "we point out that there are no theoretical and experimental arguments for ignoring epi in htsc cuprates . to this end",
    "it is necessary to answer several important questions which are related to experimental findings in htsc cuprates ( oxides ) : ( 1 ) if epi is responsible for pairing in htsc cuprates and if superconductivity is of @xmath177 type , how are these two facts compatible ? ( 2 ) why is the transport epi coupling constant @xmath178 ( entering resistivity ) much smaller than the pairing epi coupling constant @xmath179 ( entering t@xmath22 ) , i.e. why one has @xmath180 ? ( 3 ) is high t@xmath181 possible for a moderate epi coupling constant , let say for @xmath182 , and under which conditions ? ( 4 ) if epi is ineffective for pairing in htsc oxides , inspite of @xmath36 , why it is so ?",
    "_ c. is a non - phononic pairing realized in htsc ? _    regarding epi one can pose a question - whether it contributes significantly to d - wave pairing in cuprates ? surprisingly , despite numerous experiments in favor of epi , a number of researchers still believe that epi is irrelevant for pairing @xcite .",
    "this belief is mainly based : ( i ) on the , previously discussed , incorrect lattice stability criterion , which implies small epi ; ( ii ) on the well established experimental fact that d - wave pairing is realized in cuprates @xcite , which is believed to be incompatible with epi .",

    "we stress that there is no such strong suppression in the quasi - particle self - energy @xcite .    _",
    "second _ , the theory gives that the coupling constant @xmath845 in htsc cuprates can be significantly larger than lda predicts , which is due to some many - body effects not present in the latter @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for some phonon modes one has @xmath856 @xmath857 .",

    "these results point to inadequacy of lda in calculations of epi effects in htsc cuprates .",
    "the isotope effect @xmath859 in the critical temperature @xmath3 was one of the very important proof for the epi pairing in low - temperature superconductors ( ltsc ) .",
    "as a curiosity the isotope effect in @xmath758 systems was measured almost exclusively in monoatomic systems and in few polyatomic systems : the hydrogen isotope effect in @xmath860 , the @xmath861 and @xmath862 isotope shift of @xmath3 in @xmath863 , and the isotope effect in @xmath864 and @xmath865 .",

    "the isotope effect @xmath859cannot be considered as the smoking gun since it is sensitive to numerous influences .",
    "for instance , in @xmath865 it is with certainty proved that the pairing is due to epi and strongly dominated by the boron vibrations , but the boron isotope effect is significantly reduced , i.e. @xmath869 .",
    "it is still unexplained .",
    "the situation in htsc cuprates is much more complicated because they contain many - atoms in unit cell .",

    "this problem will be discussed only briefly since more extensive discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the pure epi pairing mechanism , the total isotope coefficient @xmath873 is given by @xmath874 where @xmath875 is the mass of the i - th element in the p - th crystallographic position .",

    "this means that measurements of @xmath882 for heavier elements are at / or beyond the ability of present day experimental techniques .",

    "<S> in _ part i _ we discuss accumulating experimental evidence related to the structure and origin of the bosonic spectral function @xmath0 in high - temperature superconducting ( htsc ) cuprates near optimal doping . some global properties of @xmath1 , such as number and positions of peaks , are extracted by combining optics , neutron scattering , arpes and tunnelling measurements . </S>",
    "<S> these methods give convincing evidence for strong electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) with @xmath2 in cuprates near optimal doping . here </S>",
    "<S> we clarify how these results are in favor of the eliashberg - like theory for htsc cuprates near optimal doping.we argue that the neglect of epi in some previous studies of htsc was based on a number of deceptive prejudices related to the strength of epi , on some physical misconceptions and misleading interpretation of experimental results .    in _ part ii _ we discuss some theoretical ingredients which are necessary to explain the experimental results related to pairing mechanism in optimally doped cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> these comprise the migdal - eliashberg theory for epi in strongly correlated systems which give rise to the forward scattering peak . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is due to the combined effects of the weakly screened madelung interaction in the ionic - metallic structure of layered cuprates and many body effects of strong correlations . </S>",
    "<S> while epi is responsible for the strength of pairing the residual coulomb interaction ( by including spin fluctuations ) triggers the d - wave pairing . </S>"
