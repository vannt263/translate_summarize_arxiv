    "recent observational data  @xcite strongly support the inflationary paradigm  @xcite as a successful solution to the shortcomings of the standard hot big bang model and the origin of density fluctuations , leading to the observed large - scale structure .",
    "nevertheless , despite its success , inflation still remains a paradigm in search of a model .",
    "successful inflationary models should thus be motivated by some fundamental physics .",
    "having this in mind , inflation has been studied extensively in the framework of supersymmetric grand unified theories , where the end of an inflationary era is generically accompanied by cosmic string formation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , inflation faces some issues regarding its onset under generic initial conditions .",
    "the studies on the probability of the onset of inflation  @xcite indicate that it should take place in the deep quantum gravity regime . a successful inflationary model",
    "could thus be obtained in the process of brane interactions , in the framework of brane cosmology within string theory  @xcite .",
    "string theory , a consistent theory of quantum gravity , which is assumed to be relevant during the early stages of our universe , leads to a number of insights into the physics of inflation .",
    "one crucial issue in cosmological models inspired by string theory is that compactification to four space - time dimensions leads to a number of scalar fields and moduli . on the one hand",
    ", moduli could play the rle of the inflaton field , provided they do not roll quickly . on the other hand though , runaway moduli would destroy any consistent cosmological model .",
    "thus , one requires moduli stabilisation , as achieved for instance within the kklt scenario  @xcite . among the various proposed brane inflation models",
    "@xcite , the kklmmt model  @xcite is a brane - anti - brane annihilation scenario in the warped geometry . in this model ,",
    "the inflaton field is associated with the relative position of branes in the compactified space , and all moduli are stabilised at the exit from inflation .",
    "brane annihilation releases energy which can then reheat the universe , thus the radiation - dominated phase of the standard hot big bang cosmology can take place .",
    "consider a type iib string theory in 10 space - time dimensions .",
    "brane annihilations allow the survival only of three - dimensional branes  @xcite , one of which plays the rle of our universe , with the copious production of fundamental ( f - strings ) and dirichlet d1-branes ( d - strings ) .",
    "such strings are of cosmological size and they could play the rle of cosmic strings  @xcite ; they are referred to in the literature as cosmic superstrings  @xcite .",
    "individually , the f- and d - strings are @xmath1-bps objects , which however break a different half of the supersymmetry each . in a number of successful brane - inflation models , as for example in the kklmmt model , a spectrum of strings , bound states of @xmath2 f- and @xmath3 d - strings , with reduced tensions was found .",
    "the bound states have tension @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the effective fundamental string tension after compactification and @xmath6 stands for the string coupling .",
    "the bound states are still @xmath1-bps objects .",
    "the presence of stable bound states implies the existence of junctions , where two different types of string meet at a point and form a bound state leading away from that point .",
    "traditionally , cosmic strings have been assumed to share the characteristics of type - ii nielsen - olesen ( no ) vortices  @xcite in the abelian higgs model .",
    "the main differences between these ordinary cosmic strings and cosmic superstrings are the following : ( i ) the intercommutation probability for ordinary strings is equal to 1 , whereas it is smaller ( often much smaller ) than 1 in the case of superstrings  @xcite ; ( ii ) ordinary string networks consist of ( sub - horizon sized ) loops and ( super - horizon sized ) long strings , whereas cosmic superstring networks have also junctions at which three string segments meet ; ( iii ) all strings in an ordinary string network have the same tension , whereas there is a whole range of tensions for superstrings .",
    "the last two of these features are shared with type - i vortices in the abelian higgs model  @xcite , but in contrast with them , cosmic superstrings have two integer - valued charges @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these differences are expected to imply a different evolution of a cosmic superstring network as compared to that of ordinary strings .",
    "in particular , a question which has early been addressed is whether such a network will eventually reach scaling , or whether it will freeze  @xcite , leading to predictions inconsistent with our observed universe .",
    "the reader can find in the literature a number of numerical experiments  @xcite with cosmic superstrings , each of them at a different level of approximation , as well as analytical studies  @xcite .",
    "these distinct features are expected to lead to different observational and cosmological consequences .",
    "the aim of our work is to build a simple field model of bound states , in analogy with the abelian higgs model used to investigate the properties of ordinary cosmic string networks , and to study its properties using lattice simulations .",
    "we are mainly interested in the overall characteristics of the network , and therefore we focus on the total energy of the network , rather than the dynamics of individual strings . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe our model . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the string spectrum . in section 4 , we describe our numerical approach to studying the string spectrum . in section 5",
    ", we present our results from numerical experiments with small and large simulations .",
    "we round up with our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we want to build a model of strings which captures the main features of the string theory model and is amenable to study via lattice simulations .",
    "therefore , we need a system which features :    * two different species of cosmic strings .",

    "we realise that by introducing a coupling of the scalar fields via the potential . *",
    "one non - bps species of cosmic string .",
    "such strings have long - range interactions ( regardless of their orientation ) and this can be realised by having the second type of string be the topological defect of a scalar field with a global u(1 ) symmetry .    in the case where both species of cosmic strings are bps",

    "the scalar potentials are parameterised by the positive constants @xmath18 . in the case of a non - bps species of string",
    ", we remove the second gauge field by setting @xmath19 .",
    "the classical equations of motion for the fields follow from the action ( [ equ : action ] ) , @xmath20    let us look at the potential terms for the two scalar fields .",
    "the overall value of the potential for the @xmath9 field depends on the value of the @xmath8 field at that location .",
    "if @xmath8 is in the vacuum , @xmath21 , the potential has the usual mexican hat form , while at the core of a @xmath8 vortex we have @xmath22 .",
    "if a @xmath9 vortex passes through the core of a @xmath8 vortex , the potential energy of the @xmath9 field at the core of the vortex is ( almost ) eliminated , so the energy of the vortex is reduced .",
    "it is therefore favourable for the two vortices to form a bound state .",
    "it is easier to illustrate how this works if we look at an extreme situation , where the thickness of the axion string is much smaller than that of the higgs string .",
    "let us consider a higgs string located at the origin of the @xmath23 plane and oriented along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "we can use the radial profile of the higgs field , @xmath25 , to determine the radial profile of the function , @xmath26 , which multiplies the axion field potential .",
    "since the axion field potential energy is non - zero only in a very small region , the function @xmath27 will be the potential seen by the axion string .",
    "therefore , the axion string will prefer to move to a location where @xmath27 is minimised , and that place is the core of the higgs string .",

    "first of all , the most commonly used formula for string tension , eq.([pq_tension ] ) , represents the bps bound for an object carrying the charges of @xmath2 @xmath31-strings and @xmath3 @xmath32-strings , the more general result being that the mass per unit length of such an object satisfies the inequality ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath33",
    "if we consider a more realistic model with explicit stabilisation of the compactification , the strings formed at the end of brane inflation will be localised at the bottom of a warped throat  @xcite , since the tension of the cosmic string is given by the value of the warp factor  @xcite : @xmath34 it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the d1 branes placed at the bottom of a warped throat embedded in a flux compactification can not be bps .",

    "a different class of objects with @xmath2 @xmath31-strings and @xmath3 @xmath32-strings units of charge was studied in  @xcite .",
    "such an object is a @xmath39-brane wrapped on the collapsing @xmath40 of a k - s throat , and the spectrum of tensions for such an object is : @xmath41 thus , the most commonly used formula for the spectrum of the string tension , eq.([pq_tension ] ) , is exact only in the bps limit , while for more general situations we expect departures from this theoretical prediction . in order to make a comparison of our model with the theoretical formula , eq .",
    "( [ pq_tension ] ) , we will numerically determine the tension of the strings for a range of values of the charges and then fit the numerical data with the expression given in eq .",
    "( [ pq_tension ] ) .",
    "the systems we use to model the strings are different in a number of aspects from the ones used so far , and we believe that our systems bring a number of improvements and allow for additional effects to be studied .    the systems used so far to simulate string networks allow for the formation of 3-string  @xcite ( or more generally n - string  @xcite ) junctions , in which all strings that meet at a point have equal tension . in our models ( constructed along the lines of  @xcite ) the bound states have different tension than the single - charge strings , following the original string theory model more closely . our models also allow to individually set the long - range interaction of each species of cosmic strings . as eq .",
    "( [ non_bps_spectrum ] ) suggests , for cosmic strings at the bottom of a k - s throat the f - string is not bps while the d - string is .",
    "we therefore expect the different components of the string to exhibit different types of long - range interactions .",
    "also , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , in models where the standard model branes are located at orbifold fixed points , not all bulk fields that couple to the cosmic strings of the model survive the orbifold projection .",
    "there will also be other fields present , coming from higher - rank form - fields integrated over collapsed cycles , which will mediate the interactions of cosmic strings obtained from higher - dimensional branes wrapping the same collapsed cycles .",
    "we therefore want to allow for the possibility to independently choose the long - range interactions between the different species of cosmic strings .",
    "in this section we construct the spectrum of @xmath30 strings formed in our model and compare it with the one predicted by string theory , eq.([pq_tension ] ) .",
    "we will start by considering an isolated defect and make an ansatz for the radial field profiles in analogy with the no vortex  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the model consists of two no vortices coupled via the scalar field potential .",

    "for such an initial configuration the gauss constraint  ( [ equ : gauss ] ) is automatically satisfied .",

    "the initial white - noise configuration excites all modes , with half - wavelengths up to the lattice spacing , and in order to see the formation and evolution of a network of defects we have to drain the excess energy from the system .",

    ", we also track the fraction of the simulation box volume occupied by single charged strings .",
    "our set - up allows us to start with initial conditions which will lead to the formation of a particular network configuration .",
    "starting with a white - noise configuration , the total volume occupied by bound states is too small to lead to a sizable difference in their volumes , for the two types of string networks .",
    "this is also due to the particular form of the potential for the axion field .",
    "this potential vanishes at the core of a higgs string and gets its largest value where the higgs field is in the vacuum .",
    "therefore , starting with white - noise initial conditions the axion strings prefer to form where the higgs field is already in the vacuum .",
    "thus , the formation of bound states is not favoured .",
    "even when we use a very large simulation box , @xmath70 , we encountered situations during the network evolution where no bound states were present .",

    "the bound states survive past the point where the local - global bound states disappear",
    ".    however , if we choose the higgs and the axion fields to be partially aligned in the initial configuration the volume of the bound states formed is large enough to obtain a statistically significant difference .",

    "we repeated the simulation choosing local strings with different windings around the periodic simulation box , such that the local and the global strings would intersect in more than one point . in both cases we observed that the long - range interaction wins in the sense that the bound states split and the global strings move towards each other and annihilate .",
    "the other case we studied was the formation and evolution of a network starting with various initial conditions .",
    "the evolution of the string networks suggests that the long - range interactions have a much more important rle in the network evolution than the formation of bound states . in the local - global networks the bound states tend to split as a result of the long - range interactions , resulting in two networks that evolve almost independently .",
    "the formation of short - lived bound states and their subsequent splitting only increases the small - scale `` wiggliness '' of the local strings . in the case of a local - local network , the absence of long - range interactions allows the bound states to be much longer - lived and significantly influences the evolution of the string network .     strings .",

    "[ bound_states_pictures],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in an attempt to express these observations in a more quantitative manner we plotted the fraction of the spatial volume occupied by the bound states for each type of a network , as well as the total energy of the string network as a function of time .",
    "the observations we mentioned above translate into a larger volume occupied by the bound states , in the absence of long - range interactions .",
    "the energy of the local - global network is larger than that of the local - local one , since the energy of the global strings is not localised and therefore the formation of bound states has a smaller effect on the total energy of the network .",
    "our results suggest that if in a string network one species of cosmic string features long - range interactions , the bound states will not survive and we have two networks evolving ( almost ) independently .",
    "we did not address the question of scaling in this work , but since the bound states split due to the long - range interactions , we expect such a network to scale rather than freeze .",
    "our study included only two extreme cases , that of local - local and of local - global networks . while we believe that the models we use represent an improvement over the previous types of models considered , as far as the tension of the strings and their bound states is concerned",
    ", there is still room for improvement in modelling the long - range interactions .    as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the long - range interactions between the cosmic strings can be much more accurately modelled by including a rank-2 antisymmetric tensor field that couples to the magnetic flux trapped at the core of the string via a chern - simons term .",
    "it was also shown that , depending on the strength of the chern - simons coupling , the interaction mediated by the rank-2 tensor field interpolates between that of local and global defects .",
    "when the coupling is very small the interaction is negligible , while at strong coupling the magnetic flux at the core of the string is almost eliminated and the network behaves like a global string network .",
    "we therefore expect the interplay between the effects of binding and those of long - range interactions to be more subtle as one changes the strength of the chern - simons coupling . at small coupling",
    "we expect the evolution of the network to be dominated by the formation of bound states , while at large coupling the effect of bound states is negligible , and one gets two species of strings evolving almost independently .",
    "we believe that the models presented in this paper represent a step forward in understanding the behaviour of a cosmic superstring network formed at the end of brane inflation in flux compactification scenarios . in a future work ,",
    "we plan to use the models presented above to address the issue of scaling in a string network .",
