    "the optical spectra of  regions in this galaxy display extremely strong [ ]  4959 ,  5007    emission due to the high electron temperature @xmath14 , a result of the low abundance of oxygen , the primary coolant .",
    "however , since the infrared lines ( see above ) are not sensitive to @xmath14 , the strong line - to - continuum contrast contrast in the infrared must have a different origin , possibly a deficiency of interstellar dust emitting at these wavelengths due to the extremely intense ultraviolet radiation field ( see lu et al .",

    "if we had used the calibrations of mcgaugh ( 1991 , 1994 ) for intermediate ionization parameters , the inferred ( o / h ) values would be systematically lower by @xmath310.1  dex , but the galaxies would retain the same order and differences in abundance values . note the contrast between ngc  693 and ngc  7771 , which have similar line fluxes and line - to - continuum contrast ( in integrated light ) but strikingly different ionic line ratios ( table  [ tab : optical_spectroscopy ] ) , which indicate that ( o / h ) and ( n / o ) are about 0.4@xmath310.5  dex higher in ngc  7771 than in ngc  693 .",
    "these two galaxies give an excellent illlustration of both the excitation - metallicity effect which is the basis of the bright - line method , and the well - known correlation between metallicity and total mass or luminosity of disk galaxies ( see garnett 2002 for a recent discussion ) .",
    "ngc  7218 is intermediate in abundance between ngc  693 and ngc  7771 .",
    "since we have only red spectra for ugc  2855 , we assume that it has the same ( o / h ) as ngc  693 based on the similarity of their r@xmath40 indices .",
    "on the other hand , ngc  1569 has extremely strong [ ] lines .",
    "taking r@xmath40 as a lower limit to r@xmath34 , we find an ( o / h ) value of about 8.2 , consistent with the result of kobulnicky & skillman ( 1997 ) .",
    "near - infrared emission lines are securely detected in 84% ( 37/45 ) of the lines and regions targeted ( table  [ tab : fluxes ] ) . in general ,  is the strongest of the observed lines , and  ( 2.122 ) the weakest ( no significant  emission is observed for any  region in the sample ) .",
    "this is also true for the extinction - corrected fluxes (   [ sec : extinction ] ) .",
    "the most notable exception to this rule is provided by ngc  4418 , which has a surprisingly large  flux , brighter in fact than the other three near - infrared lines observed combined .",
    "the equivalent widths are generally smaller for the nuclei than for the  regions .",
    "for example , the uncertainty - weighted averages for  and  are @xmath41    and @xmath42    for nuclei and @xmath43    and @xmath44    for  regions .",
    "this is no surprise since the nuclear regions have comparatively much stronger near - infrared continuum emission from older stars .",
    "ho , fillipenko , & sargent ( 1997 ) found a similar result in their study of  nuclei and disk  regions .",
    "the  and  equivalent widths are essentially ratios of line emission from  regions around young stars to continuum emission from older stars .",
    "if the conditions of either an instantaneous starburst or recent constant star formation are met , then these equivalent widths are excellent age indicators . from a modeler s perspective",
    ", one needs to know the star formation history for at least 1  gyr ; if there are variations in the star formation rate with time , the continuum is difficult to constrain . on the other hand ,",
    "if the recent starburst is dominant and has an age less than 30  myr , its red supergiant population is often so strong that the older population does not significantly affect the inferred starburst age .",
    "for example , in the @xmath45 instantaneous starburst model of starburst99 ( figure  51 of leitherer et al . 1999 ) , the peak in the @xmath46 band luminosity as a function of time ( for @xmath47 ) stems from the burst s red supergiant population ; this peak at @xmath48  yr characterizes the starburst .",
    "compare this luminosity to the luminosity generated by a galaxy - wide continuous @xmath49  yr@xmath22 star formation that occurs for , say , @xmath50  yr ( see their figure  52 ) .",
    "considering that only a small portion of this underlying global luminosity is projected to spatially overlap with an individual  region ,  equivalent widths for an  region can indeed be relatively unaffected by an older population .",
    "assuming that the  equivalent width can be related to the effective star formation age , the ages derived for an instantaneous starburst ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) range from a few million years for the youngest  regions to longer than 10  myr for the oldest nuclear regions ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "the  regions tend to have more recent starbursts than nuclei .",
    "if nuclei in general are not defined by a single starbursting population , and instead are comprised of star formation episodes that span a range of ages , then it is expected that their inferred ages would be older than an isolated starburst .",
    "interestingly , excluding the unusual system ngc  4418 , there is perhaps a trend in the starburst age with mid - infrared color .",
    "systems with lower , indicating more active star formation , tend to be younger ( see figure  [ fig : density ] ) .",
    "a similar trend was previously reported for a study of galaxy circumnuclear regions ( roussel et al .",
    "finally , readers familiar with post - starburst ngc  1569 may be surprised by its apparently young age .",
    "we emphasize that our observations centered on two  regions , not the famous super - star clusters .",
    "moreover , the differing spatial distributions in the continuum and line (   [ sec : spatial_distribution ] ) can lead to ill - defined equivalent widths ; we have extracted an average equivalent width , based on the entire fluxes within the pifs field of view .      for the nuclear regions where line emission is detected , the continuum and line emission are generally co - spatial ( have similar morphology ) .",
    "on the other hand , there are clear spatial offsets between the line emission from the ionized gas and the continuum emission in the disk  regions ( see the maps in figure  [ fig : pifs1][fig : pifs4 ] ) .",
    "the similar distributions of the line ( gas ) and continuum emission ( stars ) in the galaxy nuclei may arise naturally , as a result of interstellar material settling to the center of the galaxy s gravitational potential well , confining the peak density of various components to a narrow region .",
    "conversely , the  regions do not provide the same kind of gravitational environment , so that the distribution of ionized gas is affected by a number of other factors .",
    "for example , interstellar material can be blown away from a region that is actively forming stars : the  map of ngc  1569 exhibits a hole centered on the two bright super starclusters , and the distinct `` s '' shape to the near - infrared line emission maps in ngc  1569  nw is also apparent in  at the same location ( martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ; the emission line contours for ngc  1569  nw correspond to gmc  3 of taylor et al .",

    "the values listed in table  [ tab : results ] are derived by least - squares fitting a screen model to the observed line ratios /  and /  ( the two line ratios are fit simultaneously ) and assuming the li & draine ( 2001 ) extinction curve . uncertainties on the derived extinctions are based on the observational uncertainties and the predicted range in the intrinsic line ratios : /@xmath51 and /@xmath52 for case b recombination ; @xmath53 ; and @xmath54 ( storey & hummer 1995 ) .",
    "a small difference is found between the nuclear and  region extinctions .",

    "the extinction for ngc  4418 is unconstrained by these data , since the fluxes for both  and  are upper limits .",
    "the range of extinctions found by ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1997 ) for a sample of over 200 ``  nuclei '' is @xmath61 .",
    "the results of kennicutt , keel , & blaha ( 1989 ) for  and starburst nuclei are consistent with this result .",
    "this range of extinction for optically - selected samples is a bit smaller than the average nuclear extinction derived for our sample ( @xmath623  mag ) , with ngc  693 being significantly higher than the average .",
    "in fact , in most cases the extinction values are larger than those indicated by our long - slit - derived ratio of h@xmath32/h@xmath16 ( note : for a ratio of total to selective extinction of @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "this is to be expected in regions where dust is mixed with gas , since the optical line emission is seen selectively from the regions of lowest extinction .",
    "as kennicutt ( 1998 ) points out , infrared - selected samples reveal much more dramatic nuclear star formation , and @xmath65 band obscuration can easily exceed several magnitudes in the cores of star - forming galaxies ; we are able to probe deeper at near - infrared wavelengths than optical studies , and the more deeply embedded sources simply are more obscured .      the number of hydrogen - ionizing photons is derived from an average of the ( extinction - corrected )  and  luminosities n(h^o ) [ s^-1]=\\ { 7.63 l_br [ 10 ^ 20  w ] + 1.40 l_pa [ 10 ^ 20  w ] } ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) . if either the  or  flux is an upper limit , then only the securely detected flux is used .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] also expresses this number in terms of the equivalent number of o8.5  v stars , using a conversion from vacca , garmany , & shull ( 1996 ) .",
    "the average projected density of ionizing photons for this sample , computed from a ratio of the number of ionizing photons to the size of the emitting region , spans two orders of magnitude , from @xmath66 = 46.4 $ ] for ngc  7218 to 48.2 for ngc  1569  nw ( the uncertainty on these numbers is 0.2 dex ) .",
    "a strong and understandable correlation is obtained between the mid - infrared color  and ionizing photon density : lower , an indicator of more active star formation , corresponds to more intense radiation environments ( figure  [ fig : density ] ) .",
    "frster schreiber et al .",
    "( in preparation ) find a similar result for disk and nuclear regions in a sample of nearby galaxies .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the one outlier in the observed trend is ngc  4418 , the most unusual target in our sample ( see   [ sec : n4418 ] , [ sec : fluxes ] , and [ sec : extinction ] ) .",
    "this object may falsely appear to be lacking in ionizing photons either because of extreme extinction , or because its  regions are very young and still rich in dust which absorbs a large fraction of the ionizing photons .",
    "finally , with the exception of the  region dubbed `` ngc  6946  ne , '' the  regions exhibit the most intense radiation fields and lowest  ratios .",

    "the observed ratio is of order @xmath69 , suggesting that the dominant excitation mechanism is shocks rather than fluorescence .",
    "the /  line ratio can be a useful diagnostic of the star formation history since  emission is thought to arise from supernova activity .",

    "as described by calzetti ( 1997 ) , molecular hydrogen on the surface of molecular clouds can be collisionally excited in gas heated by slow shocks , ultraviolet radiation , and x - ray radiation , or it can result from fluorescence following ultraviolet absorption . empirically , starburst galaxies and  regions exhibit lower /  ratios ( larkin et al . 1998 ) .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : ratios ] confirms that these line ratios help to empirically distinguish between galaxies powered by different processes .",
    "data from the literature show there is an approximate trend proceeding from the upper right to the lower left of increasing star formation activity and decreasing agn activity ( or , in the absence of agn activity , decreasing star formation activity occurring in brief , intense and embedded bursts with shocks ) . in fact , all three  regions for which we measured both line ratios reside in the lower left , and the one source in our sample suggested to harbor agn activity , ngc  4418 ( roche et al . 1986 ; baan , salzer , & lewinter 1998 ; spoon et al .",
    "2001 ) , is the upper - rightmost data point in our sample .",
    "the nuclear observations for the remainder of our sample lie between these extremes .",
    "it should be noted , however , that systems with low metallicity might be expected to have low iron - to - hydrogen ratios regardless of the source that powers their infrared emission ; the location of ic  10 and ngc  1569 in figure  [ fig : ratios ] must reflect in part their low metallicity .",
    "following frster schreiber et al .",

    "the emissivities are computed in the low density limit  @xmath74 ( hamann & ferland 1999 ; quinet , le dourneuf , & zeippen 1996 ) , so we assume collisional de - excitation is unimportant when computing line emissivities . ]",

    "the fe@xmath1 abundances are listed in table  [ tab : results ] . for comparison ,",

    "one particular object exhibits extreme properties in essentially every category .",
    "ngc  4418 is isolated in plots of near - infrared line ratios , ionizing photon density and starburst age . unlike every other source",
    ", it was undetected in  and , and  is the brightest of the four transitions sampled .",
    "it is possible that ngc  4418 deviates from the overall age - infrared color trend due to a more complicated star formation history .",
    "some claim the galaxy harbors a heavily obscured agn ( roche et al .",
    "1986 ; spoon et al .",
    "2001 ) , while others suggest it is a pre - starburst galaxy .",
    "roussel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , for example , use new multi - wavelength radio data to argue that galaxies like ngc  4418 may be experiencing the very onset of a starburst after a long time of quiescence , giving them a distinctive infrared emission signature in both continuum and lines .",
    "other studies have shown ngc  4418 to likewise be peculiar (   [ sec : n4418 ] ) . though our data do not have the spectral and spatial resolution to resolve this debate , they similarly point to an object that is not currently powered by star formation .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy over two spatial dimensions has been obtained for the first time for nuclear and extranuclear star - forming regions in a diverse sample of nine nearby galaxies .",
    "the sample was previously observed with @xmath2 as part of the key project on the interstellar medium of normal galaxies .",
    "mid - infrared and other ancillary data are used in conjunction with continuum and line maps at , , , and  wavelengths to explore the physical processes underlying star formation .    in this small sample ,",
    "the  regions differ from the galaxy nuclei according to nearly every metric .",
    "nuclear observations typically show spatial coincidence of the continuum and line emission , unlike that seen for star - forming extranuclear regions .",
    "in addition , the star - forming episodes characterizing the  regions appear to be younger and more intense than in the nuclei .",
    "one hypothesis is that the density of material in nuclear regions supplies continual , on - going episodes of star formation , while extranuclear star - forming regions are more transient and dependent upon random overdensities in the interstellar distribution .",
    "thus if measures of a single star - formation age are made , such as that inferred from  equivalent widths , on - going nuclear star formation would naturally lead to longer timescales than that seen for individual starbursting episodes in  regions .",
    "moreover , continual nuclear star formation means both the near - infrared continuum and line transitions would be strong at the same locations , even if they represent stellar populations of different ages . alternatively , though there may be cycling in the nuclear star formation history , the strong central density gradient should result in spatially coincident continuum and line emission .",
    "though the  regions appear to differ from the nuclei by most measures , this result is perhaps not surprising nor profound , especially given our limited sample of targets .",
    "near - infrared line ratios that distinguish between agn and star - forming activity are consistent with the  regions being dominated by star formation whereas the nuclear regions reflect a mixture of star formation and a secondary ionization component ( in the absence of agn activity , the secondary component could be due to embedded and intense starburst - induced shocks ) .",
    "perhaps the nuclei are not exclusively powered by normal star formation , echoing the suggestion of terlevich et al .",
    "( 1992 ) that agn activity is the natural consequence of the final stages of intense nuclear star formation .",
    "ho , filippenko , & sargent ( 1997 ) find that about half ( 42% ) of the bright spirals have nuclear emission spectra with  region - like line ratios ; the percentage is a steep function of global morphology , with up to 80% of the later types exhibiting  nuclei .",
    "kennicutt , keel , & blaha ( 1989 ) find that approximately `` half of the  region and starburst nuclei show evidence for a secondary ionization component , either an active galactic nucleus or large - scale shocks ... [ supporting ] the idea that many spiral nuclei are composite in nature , with a central liner or seyfert - like nucleus surrounded by star - forming regions . ''",
    "consistent with this interpretation , our nuclear data do not exhibit extreme line ratios indicative of pure star formation or agn dominance , but instead suggest a combination of the two processes .",
    "one of the secondary goals of this work was to search for any trends in the sample as a function of metallicity .",
    "no obvious correlations are seen with respect to the oxygen abundances .",
    "however , on a purely empirical basis the  regions show lower gas - phase fe@xmath1 abundances than nuclei by an order of magnitude . _",
    "total _ gas - phase fe abundances can not be computed with these data since only the singly - ionized species has been observed .",
    "these data are additionally limited since fe@xmath1 abundances are difficult to interpret .",
    "not only do fe@xmath1 abundances depend on the overall amount of fe produced , fe@xmath1 abundances also depend on the ionizing strength of the interstellar radiation field and how much fe has been depleted onto , or released from , dust grains .",
    "these complications are likely why the abundances do not correspond in any way to the derived metallicities .",
    "nevertheless , there is an interesting contrast in the fe@xmath1/h abundance for the -like regions and the nuclei .",
    "the -like regions show low abundances in comparison to the nuclei .",
    "lack of abundance data from additional ionic species leaves many questions unanswered . for example , do environments with harder radiation fields like  regions exhibit relatively higher fe@xmath77 and fe@xmath78 abundances , helping to explain their relatively low fe@xmath1 abundances ?",
    "models of orion nebula data indirectly support this scenario , with ionization fractions of fe@xmath1/fe@xmath77/fe@xmath78=0.0128/0.244/0.744 ( baldwin et al .",
    "1991 ) and 0.0529/0.414/0.533 ( rubin et al . 1991 ) .",
    "to directly compare these fractions in a relatively soft and a relatively hard radiation environment , we utilize the nebula software ( rubin et al .",
    "1991 as updated recently rodrguez & rubin 2003 ) . keeping the metallicity ( orion - like ) and the number of ionizing photons ( 10@xmath79 ) the same from simulation to simulation , we find a relatively small change in the fe@xmath1 abundance but a clear shift to higher fe@xmath78 abundances , mostly at the expense of fe@xmath77 , for harder radiation fields ( see table  [ tab : ratios ] ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result is that portrayed in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : density ] , the relation between ionizing photon density and mid - infrared color .",
    "relatively intense radiation fields result in lower , likely via two different effects : reduced emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a steepening mid - infrared continuum at 15  ( e.g. dale et al .",
    "1999 ; dale et al . 2001",

    "<S> unlike observations of nuclear regions ,  region near - infrared observations do not show a spatial coincidence of the line and continuum emission ; the continuum and line maps of  regions usually show distinct and sometimes spatially - separated morphologies . gauging from  and  equivalent widths and luminosities , the  regions have younger episodes of star formation than the nuclei and more intense radiation fields . </S>",
    "<S> near - infrared line ratio diagnostics suggest that  regions have `` purer '' starbursting properties . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation between ionizing photon density and mid - infrared color is consistent with the star formation activity level being higher for  regions than for nuclei . and </S>",
