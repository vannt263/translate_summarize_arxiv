    "observing the large - scale distribution of matter provides us the rich information about not only the late - time evolution but also the primordial nature of the universe . among various cosmological parameters characterizing the primordial universe , we are particularly interested in possible departures from a purely gaussian distribution of primordial density fluctuations called primordial non - gaussianity ( png ) , which is one of the most powerful tests of inflation and more generally a key to understanding the extreme high - energy physics .",
    "one of the major theoretical discoveries is that _ all _ inflationary models predict the presence of the consistency relation between the parameters characterizing png . for the simplest scenarios ,",
    "if there is the nonvanishing local - form bispectrum , the trispectrum must necessarily exist with @xmath5 , where @xmath1 and @xmath0 are the so - called local - type nonlinear parameters characterizing the amplitude of the primordial bispectrum and trispectrum . even in a general situation",
    ", one can show that there is a universal relation , @xmath6 , which is often refereed to as the suyama - yamaguchi inequality  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the primordial trispectrum is also usually characterized by another nonlinear parameter , @xmath7 , which corresponds to the strength of the intrinsic cubic nonlinearities of primordial fluctuations .",
    "hence a detection of the higher - order png and the confirmation of the inequality would indicate the presence of more complicated dynamics , e.g. , multifield inflationary models , in the primordial universe and should be , thus , the target in future experiments ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the current limits on these parameters have been obtained from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies : @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath10 statistical significance  @xcite and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 c.l . )",
    "however , cmb measurements are already close to being cosmic - variance limited . a complementary way to access png is to measure its impact on a large - scale structure . for the standard gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "the halo bias is often assumed to be linear , deterministic , and scale independent .",
    "it was found that the non - gaussianity in primordial fluctuations effectively introduces a _ scale - dependent _ clustering of galaxies on large scales  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on scale - dependent _ stochastic _ halo bias .",
    "if @xmath13 , the halo density contrast @xmath14 is not @xmath15 correlated to the matter linear density field @xmath16 even in the absence of the shot noise  @xcite .",
    "namely , the simple bias relation @xmath17 should be modified due to the stochasticity . the halo - halo power spectrum between @xmath18- and @xmath19-mass bins , @xmath20 , can not be expressed as the products of the linear bias defined by @xmath21 and the linear matter density power spectrum @xmath22 .",
    "formally this means @xmath23 .",
    "this provides the unique opportunity of large - scale scale - dependent _ stochastic _ bias as a probe of the primordial universe associated with complicated dynamics .",
    "a promising way to explore png in future large - scale structure surveys is to reduce the cosmic - variance noise with the so - called multitracer technique  @xcite , which allows us to measure the scale - dependent bias very accurately . since using the multitracer technique we can constrain the png in the halo bias without suffering from the cosmic - variance noise , the clustering analysis in this case",
    "is expected to be limited only due to the contributions from the shot noise . in order to reduce the remaining noise contribution , the two - dimensional map of the large - scale structure projected along the line of sight is considered , while the redshift information of galaxies would be lost by the projection . although the multitracer technique is truly effective for three dimensional statistics , in this paper we will focus on two - dimensional one as a simple extension of our previous work  @xcite .",
    "even when we use the projected density contrasts as tracers , the multitracer technique is expected to be still effective .",
    "indeed ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the constraining power on @xmath1 drastically improves even when splitting samples into two tracers and increases with the number of tracers . in this paper",
    "we extend the multitracer technique to include the effects of the higher - order png and discuss the required survey level needed to test the consistency relation . as future representative surveys",
    ", we consider euclid-   in optical and infrared bands , and the square kilometre array ( ska)-   in radio wavelength .",
    "both telescopes will perform ultimate galaxy surveys with different characteristics .",
    "the euclid photometric galaxy survey ( @xmath24 ) will reach @xmath25 and provides redshift information , which is highly advantageous to constrain @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the ska continuum galaxy survey will cover a wider area of sky ( @xmath26 ) and a significant redshift depth ( @xmath27 ) , while the redshift information is not available . as we will show below",
    ", the wide and deep survey provided by ska can constrain @xmath0 effectively .",
    "in what follows , we compute the angular power spectrum for the halo density contrast , extending our previous work  @xcite to include the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath7 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we first split whole samples into mass - divided subsamples for each redshift bin to apply the multitracer technique .",
    "it can be shown that in the presence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 the halo - halo power spectrum between the @xmath18 th and @xmath19 th mass bins is expressed as  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) @xmath28 p_{\\rm mm }      \\,,\\label{eq : fnl - taunl power spectrum }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the growth factor , and @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the matter transfer function normalized to unity at large scales  @xcite . throughout the paper",
    ", we use the expression @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the critical density for spherical collapse and we will take the @xmath35 to fit the numerical simulation  @xcite .",
    "we employ a fit to simulation for the mass function @xmath36 and the linear bias factor @xmath37 given in @xcite .",
    "if there is a nonvanishing @xmath7 , we should take into account the additional correction to the halo bias as @xmath38  @xcite , and we adopt the fitting function for @xmath39 to simulation  @xcite . when defining @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath7 , we have evaluated primordial fluctuations at present , though at the decoupling for the cmb convention , suggesting that the observed nonlinear parameters have the relation  @xcite : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . with eq .",
    ", the halo - halo angular power specta between @xmath18- and @xmath19-mass bins in the @xmath43 th redshift bin is given by    @xmath44          p^{(bb')}_{\\rm hh }      \\,,\\label{c_l def }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the comoving distance , and @xmath47 denotes the average density .",
    "we have introduced @xmath48 to represent the selection function .    to take advantage of the multitracer technique",
    ", we need to estimate the halo mass of each galaxy , which has to be inferred from available observables .",
    "however , since estimates of the halo mass involve large uncertainties , a number of nuisance parameters should be included to model systematic errors .",
    "we assume the mass - observable relation including uncertainties in the mass inference from available data . in our treatment , the probability of assigning the estimated mass @xmath49 to the true mass @xmath50",
    "is assumed to be given by log - normal distribution with the variance @xmath51 and the bias @xmath52  @xcite . with these",
    ", the selection function can be expressed as @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the gray - body factor to denote the ratio between halos and what we really observe for each mass bin , because we may not observe all galaxies associated with the underlying dark matter halos .",
    "hereafter we will introduce @xmath56 nuisance parameters in the variance and the bias to quantify the impact of possible residual systematic errors on the parameter estimation  @xcite .    in order to understand the constraints on the non - gaussian parameters , @xmath57 and @xmath7 , it is useful to note that their effects on the halo - halo power spectrum have different redshift- , scale- and halo - mass dependences .",
    "the correction to the bias roughly scales as @xmath58 for @xmath1 , @xmath59 for @xmath0 , and @xmath60 for @xmath7 . because the correction to the bias from @xmath1 is identical to the one from @xmath61 , @xmath1 and @xmath7",
    "are degenerate for a single tracer case .",
    "however , in the case with multiple tracers , the different halo - mass dependence of @xmath62 and @xmath63 would break their degeneracy  @xcite . on the other hand , because the bias correction due to @xmath0 has larger dependences on the scale and redshift , its detectability would be enhanced for a survey with larger angular scale and higher redshift coverage .",
    "thus , we expect that , with the multitracer technique , wide and deep surveys will be powerful to probe higher - order png .",
    "to study the required survey level needed to test the consistency relation , we proceed to the fisher analysis .",
    "the fisher matrix is defined by @xmath64 , where the indices @xmath65 run over the redshift and mass bins @xmath66 , @xmath67 are free parameters to be determined by observations , and @xmath68 is the observed power spectrum including the shot noise contamination . the marginalized expected @xmath10 error on @xmath67 is estimated to be @xmath69 .",
    "we adopt the covariant matrix for multiple tracers whch are observed in different sky areas with some overlap given in @xcite .    before showing the expected constraints",
    ", we need to specify the survey parameters .",
    "we consider the ska radio continuum survey , the euclid photometric survey , and their combination as future representative surveys with significant high precisions .",
    "ska covers @xmath26 out to @xmath70 , though there is only one redshift bin since the redshift information is not available .",
    "then we simply drop the redshift dependence in @xmath71 and @xmath72 . to infer the halo masses",
    ", we consider five radio galaxy types such as star - forming galaxies , radio quite quasars , radio - loud agn ( fri and frii ) , and starbursts .",
    "following @xcite , we will assign these galaxy types the following halo mass : @xmath73 in the unit of @xmath74 . in order to have a plausible distribution for the halo mass associated with each population , we introduce the five separating masses",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 . with these",
    ", the five mass bins can be defined through @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 . to match the expected number density distribution of galaxies  @xcite",
    ", we adopt the gray - body factor @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively . as for euclid ,",
    "the covered area @xmath24 and the redshift range @xmath85 are considered .",
    "the redshift information is provided though photometric redshifts .",
    "galaxy samples are then split into five redshift bins with same interval @xmath86 .",
    "since photometric surveys provide various galaxy properties such as luminosity , color , and stellar mass , which can be used to infer the halo mass , we can further split the galaxy samples according the estimated halo mass .",
    "we consider five mass bins such that each mass bin of the same redshift bin has the same number density , presumably because the tightest constraint is expected to be obtained when the shot noises for the mass bins become comparable .",
    "for the flux cut , we adopt the minimum observed mass for each redshift bin , @xmath87 , and set @xmath88 instead . for the combination of these surveys",
    ", the area of the overlap region is assumed to be @xmath89 and we neglect the contributions from the derivative of the cross - correlations for simplicity . in total",
    "we include @xmath90(ska)@xmath91(euclid ) nuisance parameters to model the systematic errors as well as three nonlinear parameters .",
    "we choose @xmath92 , and zero for the other parameters as fiducial values . to calculate the fisher matrix , we use @xmath93 for ska and @xmath94 for euclid .",
    "we hereafter focus on constraints on @xmath57 , and @xmath7 , marginalizing over the other parameters .",
    "our fiducial model is a standard @xmath95cdm cosmological model with the parameters : @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "marginalized contours in @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 planes with the vanishing fiducial values of the nonlinear parameters . to see the dependence on the minimal multipole we also plot the results for ska with @xmath107 in the dashed line .",
    ", width=321 ]    in order to see the impact of the higher - order png on the parameter estimation , we first plot the @xmath10 expected marginalized contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnl - taunl - gnl_fisher ] , in the case with vanishing nonlinear parameters .",
    "although the resultant constraints on @xmath1 are slightly weaker than the previous results  @xcite where @xmath0 and @xmath7 were neglected , the constraints from both ska and euclid are still significant , @xmath108 . especially , the redshift information obtained from the photometric survey significantly improves the constraint on @xmath1  @xcite . as for @xmath0 , ska2 can reach @xmath109 , which is an improvement by a factor of @xmath110 compared with the planck constraint .",
    "in contrast , the constraint from euclid , @xmath111 , is relatively weaker than one from ska1 , @xmath112 .",
    "this is understood as follows .",
    "the bias correction from @xmath0 has stronger dependence on the wavelength and redshift than those from @xmath1 and @xmath7 as argued above",
    ". then wider sky coverage and deeper redshift are expected to be more advantageous to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "although the redshift information is not available for ska , the contributions from high-@xmath113 samples are significant to the effective bias . to see the effect of sky coverage , we also plot the expected contours for ska with @xmath114 in the dashed line .",
    "we find that @xmath114 reduces the power of the ska significantly and becomes comparable or weaker than euclid , suggesting that the full - sky observation of the ska is essential when we try to constrain the higher - order png .",
    "similarly , the expected constraints on @xmath7 are given as @xmath115 ( euclid ) , @xmath116 ( ska1 ) , and @xmath117 ( ska2 ) , which are several tens of times severer than that obtained from planck .",
    "these different behaviors suggest that ska and euclid turned out to be complementary probes of png and the joint analysis between ska and euclid are quite effective to confirm the png consistency inequality .     and @xmath118 .",
    "for comparison , the inconsistent region and the constraints from planck are also shown in gray color .",
    ", width=321 ]    we then study the dependence of our forecast on the choice of the fiducial values , concentrating on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "for this purpose , we consider stochastic bias with values of @xmath0 which satisfies @xmath119 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] , we show the region where both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are detected at @xmath10 significance , that is , @xmath120 and @xmath118 in @xmath104 plane for ska1(2 ) , euclid , and their combinations .",
    "when @xmath0 is close to the nonstochastic value , there is little stochasticity and the tightest constraint on @xmath1 is obtained , as expected . on the other hand , with increasing @xmath0 , the constraining power on @xmath1 decreases , mainly because the correction from @xmath0 to the halo bias dominates that from @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the relatively smaller @xmath0 is needed to detect @xmath1 .",
    "we find from the figure that even for ska1 there is a wedge - shaped region where we can confirm the consistency inequality at more than @xmath10 level . as is anticipated , the confirmation of the inequality becomes harder as decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is small , say @xmath121 , the confirmation at the @xmath122 level is rather challenging for a single survey , even with the multitracer technique .",
    "however , combining ska2 and euclid can break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and drastically improve the constraints to reach the confirmation of the consistency relation even for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we roughly estimate the boundary of the viable region as @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "to summarize , we have discussed the potential impact of the higher - order nonlinear parameters @xmath125 , and the required survey level needed to test the png consistency relation @xmath6 for future galaxy surveys such as ska radio continuum and euclid photometric surveys . with the multitracer technique , the fisher matrix analysis has revealed that deep survey and large sky coverage provided by ska are advantageous to constrain @xmath0 , while the euclid photometric survey has the strong constraining power for @xmath1 thanks to redshift information .",
    "the information from both euclid and ska is quite essential to break the degeneracy between the nonlinear parameters . indeed",
    "the combination of ska2 and euclid can detect the consistency inequality in the wide parameter region at more than @xmath10 level , more specifically even for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , though for a single survey it is still hard to confirm when @xmath4 .",
    "our analysis also implies that the large - angle observations is quite essential to provide the constraints on the higher - order png .",
    "we should address the spectroscopic surveys conducted by both the ska and euclid . in this paper",
    "we conservatively assumed no redshift information for the ska and relatively large redshift bin for the euclid .",
    "the redshift information for individual galaxies obtained from the spectropic surveys may allow the tomographic analysis to enhance the fisher matrix due to the cross - correlations between the different redshift bins , providing the improvement of the constraints .",
    "we hope to come back to these issues in the near future .",
    "when the constraints on nonlinear parameters , in particular @xmath1 , are close to @xmath126 , the general relativistic correction in the observed power spectrum might not be negligible  @xcite .",
    "we have simply neglected this effect expecting that we can subtract the effect from the observed power spectrum .",
