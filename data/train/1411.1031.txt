    "dust grain alignment in protostellar environments is closely linked to both magnetic fields and the physical parameters of the dust grains in these regions . since the discovery of polarized starlight by @xcite and @xcite , interstellar polarization has provided clues about the role that magnetic fields play in star formation @xcite . the polarization caused by transmission through a medium with asymmetrical , aligned dust grains",
    "can be directly related to the orientation of the magnetic field in the plane of the sky .",
    "also , polarization ( and extinction ) measurements teach us about the size distribution , shape and structure of the dust grains themselves @xcite .",
    "we know from observations that spinning , asymmetric dust grains align with their long axes perpendicular to the surrounding magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite first suggested this connection . depending on whether the polarization is in transmission or emission , the observed",
    "polarization is either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "however , despite years of research and theoretical work , we still do not have a comprehensive model of how the dust grains are actually aligned .",
    "evidence is strong that in the very diffuse ism grain alignment is nearly perfect .",
    "computations using infinite cylinders by @xcite reproduce the wavelength dependence of the polarization assuming perfect alignment of the large silicate grains . using the observed trend of polarization with extinction in the optical and the wavelength dependence of the polarization , @xcite found that a high alignment fraction was necessary for the large silicate grains to produce the observed @xmath9 , the polarization per unit optical depth . this was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "there are three main grain alignment theories that have been developed to explain interstellar polarization .",
    "@xcite suggested that mechanical effects due to gas flow relative to the heavier grains could align grains , but this mechanism is not supported by the vast majority of observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite developed a mechanism that relied on dissipation of rotational energy into heat in rotating grains through paramagnetic relaxation to align the grains with the magnetic field .",
    "even with enhancements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this theory is difficult to reconcile with observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "radiative torque alignment , originally proposed by @xcite , has been explored more recently by various authors , including @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite .",
    "recent work on observational tests for the radiative alignment theory can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "note that radiative alignment occurs with long grain axes perpendicular to b , i.e. , in the expected orientation .",
    "this results not from paramagnetic relaxation but from averaging of radiative torques as the grain angular momentum precesses about b @xcite .",
    "if grains were perfectly aligned everywhere , in all environments , then the grain alignment mechanism would be an interesting physics problem , but of only moderate importance to the study of the ism using interstellar polarization . however , there is increasing evidence that grain alignment suffers dramatically reduced efficiencies in certain regions of the ism , in particular dense molecular gas with no internal stars .",
    "since these regions are sites of future star formation , and interstellar polarization provides an important tool for studying the magnetic field geometry in these regions , a realistic grain alignment model that accounts for these changes is a necessity .",
    "starless cores provide an important testbed for grain alignment theories , as optical depths can range beyond @xmath10 @xcite . unfortunately , because of these high optical depths , it is impossible to find stars bright enough to be seen at visual wavelengths behind these very dense regions . by obtaining polarization measurements at wavelengths from the near - ir though the submm , we can work at these very high visual optical depths .",
    "the fractional polarization as a function of extinction for various wavelengths can provide clues about grain alignment along these heavily extinguished lines of sight .",
    "the grain alignment efficiency has been measured primarily by studying the fractional polarization divided by optical depth ( @xmath9 ) in both diffuse and dense regions .",
    "@xcite observed that this ratio in dark clouds was significantly lower than in the diffuse ism when viewing background field stars . @xcite and @xcite later suggested that beyond @xmath11 a few , the grains in cold dark clouds could not polarize background field stars at all .",
    "however , a different data set presented by @xcite showed that for background field stars , @xmath9 _ decreases _ with extinction , but does _ not _ go to zero .",
    "in fact , an extensive analysis by @xcite shows that @xmath9 decreases roughly as @xmath12 in most dark clouds , but does not fall as @xmath13 , which would indicate the complete absence of grain alignment at the higher optical depths .",
    "@xcite used @xmath14 band polarimetry results using mimir @xcite to study the magnetic field geometry and fractional polarization in a study of the l183 starless core .",
    "he finds that compared to the relatively unextincted surrounding stars , the reddened stars show no increase in polarization with extinction , suggesting that all of the polarization is induced in the outer layers of the cloud . these results probe extinctions up to @xmath15 and do not penetrate the cloud core .",
    "@xcite does , however , find clear evidence for an influence from the presence of the inner core of l183 on the magnetic field in the outer regions .",
    "@xcite studied the optical , near - infrared and submm polarimety of a starless core in the pipe nebula .",
    "they find that @xmath9 for the near - infrared polarimetry initially drops with a slope of @xmath13 , but beyond @xmath16 becomes more shallow with a slope of @xmath17 .",
    "polarization observations along lines of sight to embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) , however , complicate the picture . for these stars , the steep decline in @xmath9 with increasing @xmath3",
    "is not seen @xcite . for embedded ysos ,",
    "the trend in @xmath9 can be explained by assuming complete grain alignment , but with the inclusion of turbulence in the magnetic field geometry @xcite . in other words , the grains along a line of sight to an embedded yso",
    "appear to be well aligned , but not so along a line of sight to a background field star seen through molecular cloud material with no internal source of optical or near - ir radiation .    in this paper , we present @xmath0 band polarization and @xmath18 photometry of background stars extincted by starless cores .",
    "compared to previous measurements at somewhat lower @xmath3 @xcite , we see evidence for a further decrease in grain alignment for @xmath19 . combining these results with an analysis of submm polarization data compiled from the scuba legacy project there is good evidence that grain alignment drops to zero at optical depths greater than @xmath8 .",
    "most of the molecular cores selected for nir polarization observations were chosen for their high submm flux ( * ? ? ?",
    "* l1544 ) or for their pre - existing submm polarization maps , such as cb3 @xcite , l43 , l183 , and l1544 @xcite .",
    "these submm observations allow us to make comparisons of the polarization at different wavelengths ( @xmath0 band in extinction vs @xmath20 in emission ) and high values for @xmath21 .",

    "for the three stars where we were forced to use @xmath50 , the error in the color could be as much as 0.7 magnitudes , corresponding to an error of @xmath51 if the source is an early type star . since early type stars are relatively rare in the field at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite and less likely to have an infrared excess compared to dusty red giants , we have not tried to make any corrections to these sources .",

    "the dot - dash line , labeled @xmath57 in figure 2 corresponds to this equation for the case where the magnetic field lies in the plane of the sky ( the optimum geometry ) and grain alignment is maximum .",
    "the vertical location of @xmath57 is determined by the observed upper limit of interstellar polarization at @xmath0 @xcite , and is equivalent to the well know relation in the visible of @xmath58 from @xcite .",
    "the dip in @xmath57 at very high extinction is due to the fact that @xmath5 can not exceed 100% , but the extinction can become arbitrarily large . the long - dash line is the jkd model for the trend of fractional polarization vs. optical depth at @xmath0 @xcite , which assumes perfect alignment but includes a turbulent component to the magnetic field of equal strength to the constant component .",
    "this line well reproduces the mean trend found by @xcite for embedded sources .",

    "or more at @xmath0 . secondly , the starless cores are typically @xmath62 across , subtending a small solid angle on the sky , greatly reducing the odds of finding a bright field star shining through from behind .",

    "the radiation necessary to align the grains also arises from outside the cloud .",
    "they find that the intensity and anisotropy of the intracloud radiation field show large variations throughout the models but are generally sufficient to drive widespread grain alignment at modest extinctions .",

    ", the cloud is modeled as an outer shell with aligned grains and an inner core with unaligned grains .",
    "these studies generally find that grain alignment is minimal for @xmath66 in the absence of a central source of radiation .",

    "ii we provide a simple argument why this is a valid procedure .",
    "although it may seem improper to directly compare polarization in transmission with polarization in emission , the trend with optical depth should be the same .",
    "if alignment is perfect with no turbulence , then the fractional polarization in emission will be constant with surface brightness ( optical depth ) provided the emission is optically thin , which is the case at submm wavelengths for all but the exact center for these starless cores .",

    "this trend will closely follow the jkd model shown in figure 2 . finally , if , only the outer skin of these molecular cloud cores has aligned grains , then the fractional polarization in emission will simply be diluted by added unpolarized flux ( optical depth ) as the line of sight penetrates the core , and we have @xmath73 , as seen in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "this is also case for @xmath9 in extinction , when the grains are no longer aligned , and increasing optical depth is not accompanied by increasing polarization .",

    "@xcite suggest that grain alignment by radiative torques appears to best explain the data . in radiative torque theory",
    "the alignment is sensitive to the ratio of wavelength to grain size ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "reddening of the external radiation field due to dust extinction progressively removes short wavelength photons which are necessary to align the smaller grains in the grain size distribution . with progressively fewer aligned grains at greater extinction , the value for @xmath9 drops . using radiative torque alignment theory , whittet et al .",

    "the solid line in figure 5 is a simple model that modifies the jkd model to vary the alignment efficiency ( fraction of grains aligned ) with optical depth . using the notation in jones ( 1989 )",
    ", the alignment efficiency is parametrized by @xmath77 , where    @xmath78    in this scheme @xmath79 and @xmath80 are understood to be the total extinction coefficients with contribution from all sizes of dust grains .",
    "if no grains are aligned , then @xmath81 , @xmath82 and the dust can not polarize starlight .",
    "the nominal value of @xmath77 is 0.875 , set by the maximum observed trend of @xmath83 with @xmath42 ( jones 1989 , 1992 ) and is equivalent to the well known relation in the visible of @xmath58 from @xcite .",
    "a smaller @xmath77 would correspond to a higher polarizing power ( not observed ) and an @xmath77 closer to 1 corresponds to weaker polarizing power , or equivalently , fewer aligned grains . in our modification of the jkd model , at each step in @xmath84 through the cloud the value of @xmath77 is no longer a constant , but is parametrized by    @xmath85    where @xmath86 . in other words , @xmath77 at low optical depths is 0.875 ( maximum alignment ) , but increases to 1.0 at increasing optical depth ( no alignment ) .",
    "the term controlling the decrease in efficiency is the extinction of light from the external radiation field ( the @xmath87 factor ) .",

    "the jkd model is a very simplistic parametrization of the physical conditions in the ism in comparison to the models for submm polarized emission discussed at the beginning of this section , but reproduces the main characteristics of the observations well .",
    "a simple decrease in alignment efficiency with optical depth can easily reproduce the observations both in extinction and in emission .",

    "submm plots of the percent polarization versus flux / extinction for individual clouds show slopes near @xmath13 , indicative of no grain alignment .",

    ", we first determine the submm optical depth @xmath110 from the observed flux @xmath109 by assuming a dust temperature @xmath111 and using the blackbody equation :                                                            the proportionality on the right is not an equality because the extinction efficiencies are wavelength dependent .",
    "also , the proportionality on the right assumes that the grain population causing the polarization in extinction is the same is the grain population causing the polarization in emission .",
    "we recognize that this has not been established by observation , and is possibly incorrect along some lines of sight @xcite .",
    "if this assumption is valid for l183 and l43 , we can write      since we have already established the relationship between optical depths at near - ir and submm wavelengths in appendix i , we use this proportionality to justify the vertical scaling of the submm polarization in figure 5 .",
    "for l183 , the scaling factor is @xmath138 and for l43 the scaling factor is @xmath139 .",
    "these scaling factors are not equal due to differences in the angle the constant component makes to the line - of - sight , differences in the dust temperature used in ( [ eq - temp ] ) , or differences in other assumptions we have made .",
