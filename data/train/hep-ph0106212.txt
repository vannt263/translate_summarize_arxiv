    "in the past twenty years there has been a great deal of theoretical study of low energy supersymmetry and a number of experimental searches .",
    "however , these searches have found no evidence for supersymmetry . within the next ten years",
    "a number of new collider experiments will probe higher energies and low energy supersymmetry will either be discovered experimentally or will no longer be relevant to the problem of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "after briefly surveying the models which are used in experimental studies we will discuss the discovery potential and signatures for current and future experiments .",
    "we will consider the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this is the supersymmetric extension of the the standard model ( sm ) which has minimal particle content , it contains two higgs doublets rather than the one of the sm and the superpartners of the standard model fields .",
    "this model has one less parameter than the standard model , provided that supersymmetry ( susy ) is unbroken .",
    "there is an additional parameter @xmath1 which gives mixing between the two higgs doublets but the couplings in the scalar potential are constrained by susy . however , as the superpartners have not been observed , susy must be broken in such a way as to not reintroduce the quadratic dependence of the higgs mass on the cutoff scale .",
    "this is called soft susy breaking and leads to a large number of additional parameters : soft susy breaking masses for the scalars and gauginos ; soft susy breaking @xmath2 terms , which couple two sfermions and a higgs ; and @xmath3 terms , which couple two higgs bosons .",
    "the trilinear @xmath2 terms are only important for the third generation sfermions as they enter in terms proportional to the fermion masses .",
    "the z boson mass is given in terms of the other parameters of the model .",
    "in the mssm r - parity related to baryon ( @xmath3 ) and lepton number ( @xmath4 ) by , is assumed to be conserved which means that susy particles can only be produced in pairs and the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is stable .",
    "as the lsp is stable it must be neutral as charged stable matter is excluded by cosmological arguments .",
    "this implies that all susy events have two lsps in them leading to missing transverse energy in susy events because the lsps do not interact in the detector .",
    "r - parity need not be conserved and this leads to very different experimental signatures @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to use the mssm for detailed experimental studies due to the large number of free parameters it contains .",
    "furthermore large ranges of the parameters are excluded and a real model will surely have far fewer fundamental parameters",
    ". therefore models of susy breaking are used which are motivated by theoretical ideas .",
    "all have a common feature ; susy is broken in some hidden sector and then transmitted to the mssm fields .",
    "the models differ in how this transmission is accomplished :    sugra : :    in supergravity models @xcite all the scalar masses    ( @xmath5 ) , the gaugino masses ( @xmath6 ) , the    @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters are assumed to be    unified at the grand unified ( gut ) scale . as the model predicts    @xmath7 in terms of the other parameters it is    possible to use @xmath8 , the ratio of the    vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) for the two higgs doublets , and the    known value of @xmath7 to fix @xmath3 and    @xmath9 .",
    "this leaves five parameters @xmath5 ,    @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath10 ,    @xmath11 which completely determine the mass spectrum    and decay patterns of the particles .",
    "the gluino mass    ( @xmath12 ) is strongly correlated with    @xmath6 and the slepton mass with @xmath5 .",
    "the    lhc experiments have defined several sugra points which are often used    in simulations @xcite .",
    "gmsb : :    the gauge mediated susy breaking model @xcite aims to solve the    flavour changing neutral current problem which is generically present    in sugra models by using gauge interactions rather than gravity to    transmit the susy breaking .",
    "the messenger sector consists of some    particles , @xmath13 , which have sm interactions and are aware    of susy breaking .",
    "the simplest choice is to have the messenger    particles in complete @xmath14 * 5 * or * 10 * representations    to preserve the gut symmetry .",
    "the fundamental susy breaking scale    @xmath15 must be such that    @xmath16 or sugra breaking will    dominate .",
    "the gaugino masses occur at one - loop while the squark and    slepton masses occur at two - loop .",
    "the lsp is an almost massless    gravitino so that the sparticles decay as in a sugra model followed by    the decay of the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) to the    gravitino .",
    "the nlsp need not be neutral and its lifetime is model    dependent .",
    "this model has six parameters : @xmath17    the scale for the susy masses ; @xmath18 the messenger    mass scale ; @xmath19 the number of    @xmath20 messenger fields ; the ratio of the    vacuum expectation values @xmath11 ;    @xmath10 the sign of the @xmath1 parameter ; and    @xmath21 which controls the nlsp lifetime .",
    "amsb : :    the super - conformal anomaly @xcite is always present and predicts    sparticle masses in terms of @xmath22 , the gravitino    mass . the simplest version of this model predicts tachyonic sleptons    and therefore some other susy breaking mechanism must be present in    order to get a realistic spectrum . one way to do this is to add a    universal scalar mass ( mamsb ) or new very heavy fields ( damsb ) .",
    "the    ( mamsb ) model has four parameters : @xmath5 the universal    scalar mass ; @xmath22 the gravitino mass ;    @xmath11 the ratio of higgs vevs ; and    @xmath10 .",
    "the damsb model has five parameters :    @xmath23 the mass of the new fields ; @xmath24 the number    of new fields ; @xmath22 ; @xmath11 ; and    @xmath10 .",
    "the amsb model has one important feature in    that the lsp is mainly wino like and almost degenerate with the    lightest chargino , @xmath25 , but this feature is lost in    damsb .",
    "all of these models are implemented in the isajet event generator @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the susy particles in these models can be very similar , an example of each is shown in fig.[fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the main differences in these models are the ratios of the squark to slepton masses and the differences between the electroweak gaugino and gluino masses . in the sugra model",
    "the scalar masses are universal at the gut scale and therefore the differences in the masses come from the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) to the electroweak scale . however , in the gmsb models the masses at the susy breaking scale are proportional to the relevant gauge couplings and therefore the strongly interacting squarks are heavier than the sleptons , relative to the sugra model . in the amsb model",
    "the sleptons are very light compared to the squarks unless the universal scalar mass is very large . similarly for the gauginos the splitting of the gluino and electroweak gaugino masses in the sugra model comes from the rge",
    "however in the gmsb model the gaugino masses are proportional to the gauge couplings at the susy breaking scale and therefore the strongly interacting gluino is heavier than the weakly interacting gauginos . in the amsb model",
    "the soft breaking mass for the gluino is larger than the soft breaking masses for the electroweak gauginos at the gut scale which gives a bigger splitting between the gluino and electroweak gauginos masses than in sugra models .",
    "the nature of the lightest neutralino is also different in the different models . in the sugra model",
    "it is usually mainly bino whereas in the amsb model it is mainly wino and degenerate with the lightest chargino . as discussed above ,",
    "the lightest neutralino in the gmsb model is the gravitino and the nlsp , which can be neutral or charged , is most important for phenomenology .",
    "obviously once supersymmetry is discovered it will be important to make accurate measurements of susy particles masses and couplings in order to investigate the model of susy breaking .",
    "however at present , given we have seen no evidence for supersymmetry in experimental studies , the main interest is in simulating models which give qualitatively different experimental signatures so that we can be certain that all variants can be observed . for example",
    "the damsb model is very similar to a sugra model and has not therefore been subjected to many detailed studies , whereas in the mamsb model which has an almost degenerate lightest neutralino and chargino the dominant chargino decay mode is @xmath26 which is very different from sugra models and therefore of more interest .",
    "there are a number of signatures which are characteristic of supersymmetry , regardless of the model of susy breaking : missing transverse energy ; a high multiplicity of high transverse momentum jets ; many isolated leptons ; copious b - jet production ; a large rate of higgs production ; isolated photons ; and quasi - stable charged particles .",
    "it should be noted that not all of these signals are present in all models and that production of any heavy object will give some of these signals .    in order to simulate supersymmetry",
    "it is essential to have a consistent model .",
    "we can not consider one sparticle in isolation because all the supersymmetric particles which are kinematically allowed will be produced . in hadron colliders production of the squarks and gluinos",
    "dominates provided the centre - of - mass energy is high enough .",
    "the production of those sparticles which only have electro - weak couplings may be dominated by the decays of squarks and not by direct production .",
    "the dominant backgrounds at the lhc are combinatorial from susy events after some simple cuts are applied .",
    "the situation at the tevatron where electroweak gaugino production may dominate and standard model processes are the most important source of background is very different . at a lepton collider where the full spectrum is unlikely to be accessible and",
    "the beam energy and polarization can be used to separate sparticles the situation is much simpler .",

    "results are shown for 2 , 10 and 30  @xmath31 integrated luminosity .",
    "the curves require the observation of at least 5 events and are @xmath32 exclusion contours .",

    "the background is included in all the histograms .",

    "a number of limits were obtained which we will not discuss here  @xcite .",
    "run ii of the tevatron which has both an increase in the centre - of - mass energy to 2  tev and one hundred times the luminosity will extend the mass range but the search reach is limited . due to the centre - of - mass energy",
    "the production of squarks and gluinos may not dominate and the best channel for the discovery of susy may be gaugino production , of @xmath51 .",
    "fig.[fig : tevatron1 ] shows the search potential in this channel at run ii of the tevatron for different integrated luminosities .",
    "the background to this process is dominated by gauge boson pair production followed by leptonic decays with @xmath52 being the dominant background process .",
    "if this signal is observed structure in the @xmath53 mass distribution will constrain the @xmath54 and @xmath55 masses , this will be discussed in more detail for the lhc in the next section .",
    "however as can be seen from fig.[fig : tevatron2 ] for those points which are still allowed by the lep limits the endpoint of the distribution which gives information on the mass difference of the lightest two neutralinos will be difficult to measure .",
    "it is possible to extend the search reach by using channels involving jets and missing transverse energy .",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered at the tevatron it will determine the mass scale of some of the particles .",
    "the lhc will then make detailed measurements of the susy spectrum .",
    "and at least one isolated lepton . an integrated luminosity of @xmath56 has been assumed .",
    "plot taken from @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    many detailed studies of the search potential of the lhc have been performed by both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations . at the lhc",
    "the strongly interacting squarks and gluinos are predominantly produced unless they are very heavy giving large susy production cross sections .",
    "this allows hard cuts to be applied to the data in order to reduce the standard model background leaving combinatorial backgrounds from the susy events themselves as the dominant source of background .",
    "most of the studies have assumed the full integrated luminosity of the lhc which enables hard cuts to be used . in practice",
    "the discovery of susy will probably take less time and use weaker cuts in which case the standard model background will be more important .",
    "the lhc studies can be broadly grouped into two categories : the first attempts to find some signal indicative of susy and find an excess in order to discover supersymmetry by exploiting inclusive signatures ; the second then tries to make use of more information from the susy events in order to measures masses and other parameters of the model .",
    "there is a very large range of accessible masses in inclusive signals , jets , leptons and missing transverse energy ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "fig.[fig : lhc1 ] shows the mass reach in sugra models for the cms experiment  @xcite .",
    "this covers all the interesting theoretical range , .",
    "it is useful to define global variables for susy searches .",
    "for example if we consider events with at least four jets and missing transverse energy the variable m_eff = p_t,1+p_t,2+p_t,3+p_t,4 + , where @xmath58 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath59th jet , is very useful .",
