    "these observations highly deviate from the relation expected for an isotropically distributed gas @xcite and instead there seems to exist high anisotropicity in the distribution of circumstellar matter around the x - ray pulsar , especially in some orbital phases .",
    "our results are in contrast to the studies by @xcite , where they found a linear correlation between equivalent width and column density , thereby favouring a spherical shell model of gas distribution .",
    "however , such studies were carried out in narrow window of pointed observations and this work is carried by averaging over multiple orbital cycles . + from orbital variation of n@xmath2 and equivalent width shown in figure .  , we see a very high equivalent width for very low line of sight column density at orbital phases 0.1 - 0.3 .",
    "this being an important outcome of the present work and the fact that it is hardest to measure absorption column density in the dim phase , we have further examined it . as the maxi - gsc spectrum has very little count - rate below 3 kev , we carried out the spectral analysis above 3.5 kev and an upper limit on n@xmath2 of 11 @xmath13 @xmath14 is obtained at the orbital phase 0.1 - 0.3 with a 90% confidence limit .",
    "near the flare phase , the spectrum has higher statistics and the best fit model for the spectrum above 3.5 kev , when extended to the lower energy band , clearly shows the presence of a soft excess .",
    "the blackbody temperature of the soft excess measured in these phases is in the range of 0.1 - 0.3 kev and this component does not have any significant contribution in the gsc spectrum above 3.5 kev .",
    "therefore , the value of n@xmath2 measured at different orbital phases ( especially at dim phase of 0.1 - 0.3 ) represents the true line of sight value of n@xmath2 .",
    "a possible explanation would be that the distribution of circumstellar matter in these orbital phases somehow avoids the line of sight and the possible geometries could be the ones in which the reprocessing region ( where the fe fluorescence line is produced ) is situated behind the neutron star or on one side of the neutron star away from the line of sight .",
    "the optical studies of gx 301 - 2 done by @xcite confirms the presence of gas stream trailing the x - ray pulsar around the orbital phases 0.18 - 0.34 .",
    "this would also be a possible explanation for the absence of second peak in the orbital distribution of n@xmath2 , though it is predicted both by @xcite and @xcite models .",
    "we have investigated the long term orbital variation of spectral parameters by exhaustive orbital phase resolved spectroscopic measurements of gx 301 - 2 with _ maxi_. the column density and flux of the fe fluorescence line has a large value around the pre - periastron passage , suggesting the possible origin of x - ray flare due to enhanced mass accretion .",
    "a large column density and strong fe emission line together with the presence of low energy excess in orbital phases around the x - ray flare , strongly favours a high density gas stream plus a stellar wind model for mode of accretion onto the neutron star in gx 301 - 2 @xcite .",
    "the orbital dependence of column density and equivalent width of fe line presented in this work provides stronger constraints to the dynamical wind plus stream model of @xcite .",
    "the presence of very high equivalent width of fe line for very low column density along line of sight at orbital phases 0.1 - 0.3 places constrains on the direction of gas stream around gx 301 - 2 orbit .",
