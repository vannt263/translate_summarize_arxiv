    "nowadays , it is generally accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of the strong interaction .",
    "it has been very successful and tested to great precision at high energies ; however , its application in the low energy region of @xmath2 1 gev is quite problematic due to the large running coupling constant . the advent of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) and lattice qcd approach has made possible a model independent study of the low - energy strong phenomena for the first time .",
    "neutrino physics has made remarkable progress in recent years , as evidenced by the 2002 nobel prize in physics ( awarded partly to raymond davis jr and masatoshi koshiba `` for pioneering contributions to astrophysics , in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos '' ) .",
    "after many years of experimental ( and theoretical ) efforts , two facts have been firmly established : ( i ) neutrino have masses and ( ii ) different flavors of neutrino can oscillate into each other .",
    "presently , one of the main goals in the field is to measure accurately the masses and oscillation parameters .",
    "a good understanding of pion production is relevant to reduce systematic uncertainties in oscillation experiments .",
    "the axial nucleon to @xmath1(1232 ) transition , characterized by four form factors , plays an important role in this reaction at low @xmath4 transfer.@xcite    most of our current ( experimental ) knowledge of the @xmath0 axial transition form factors comes from neutrino bubble chamber data.@xcite the possibility to extract them using parity - violating electron scattering at jefferson lab has been extensively studied,@xcite and could shed new light on the nature of these form factors .",
    "present and future neutrino experiments ( miniboone , k2k , fermilab ) could also provide further information .    in the past , the theoretical descriptions have been done using different approaches , mostly quark models ( for a review , see ref .  ) . in recent years , there has been an increasing interest on these form factors .",
    "they have been calculated , for instance , using the chiral constituent quark model and light cone qcd sum rules .",
    "state of the art calculations within lattice qcd have also become available.@xcite    while the axial @xmath0 form factors have been addressed in ( tree level ) hb@xmath3pt,@xcite _ no calculation has been performed up to now within the relativistic framework_. with lattice qcd results becoming available and in view of the many ongoing experimental efforts to extract these form factors from electron- and neutrino - induced reactions , it is timely to study the axial @xmath0 transition form factors within covariant baryon @xmath3pt.@xcite",
    "the study of the @xmath0 transition form factors using covariant baryon @xmath3pt is much more complicated than it seems to be . to begin with",
    ", one has to address the following three questions : power counting , chiral lagrangians , and the appropriate form of the @xmath1 propagator .    1",
    ".   a proper power counting scheme is at the center of effective field theories . to include the @xmath5 explicitly",
    ", one has to count the @xmath6-@xmath1 mass difference @xmath7gev properly . in the present work ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath8 expansion scheme , which counts @xmath9 as @xmath10 to maintain the scale hierarchy @xmath11.@xcite 2 .",
    "the pion - nucleon and pion - pion lagrangians are rather standard .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 lagrangians , on the other hand , require more attention .",
    "the @xmath5 is a spin-3/2 resonance and , therefore , its spin content can be described in terms of the rarita - schwinger ( rs ) field , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the lorentz index .",
    "this field , however , contains unphysical spin-1/2 components . in order to tackle this problem",
    ", we follow ref .   and adopt the `` consistent '' couplings , which are gauge - invariant under the transformation @xmath16 3 .",
    "different forms of the spin-3/2 propagator have been used in the literature , some of which may lead to serious theoretical problems.@xcite due to the spin-3/2 gauge symmetric nature of the consistent couplings , we can use the most general spin-3/2 free field propagator.@xcite    a more detailed discussion of these issues and the relevant @xmath12 and @xmath13 lagrangians can be found in ref .  .",
    "axial transition form factors up to order @xmath17 .",
    "the double , solid , and dashed lines correspond to the delta , nucleon , and pion , respectively ; while the wiggly line denotes the external pseudovector source.[fig_diagram ] ]    the @xmath0 axial transition form factors can be parametrized in terms of the usually called adler form factors:@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the third isospin component of the axial current .    in the @xmath8 expansion scheme , up to order @xmath17 , all diagrams contributing to the axial @xmath0 transition form factors",
    "are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] .",
    "the corresponding results in terms of low - energy constants ( lec ) and loop functions are summarized in table [ table : avf ] .",
    "we can easily see that at @xmath20 , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 coupling determined from the @xmath1 width , which is close to the kitagaki - adler value@xcite of 1.2 .",
    "the kitagaki - adlder assumption @xmath24 , on the other hand , is satisfied only up to @xmath25 , i.e. , non pion - pole contributions appear at order @xmath17.@xcite    the form factors @xmath26 and @xmath27 both start at chiral order 2 and get their @xmath28 dependence at order 3 from the loops . for @xmath26",
    ", we find a small @xmath28 dependence , which is quite sensitive to the @xmath29 coupling constant . on the other hand , its imaginary part ,",
    "coming mainly from the @xmath6-@xmath6 internal diagram , is finite ( @xmath30 at @xmath31 ) and has a mild @xmath28 dependence .",
    "this suggest that @xmath26 is small ( compared to @xmath32 ) but not necessarily zero .",
    "the @xmath27 dependence on @xmath28 is also found to be rather mild at order @xmath17 .    in covariant",
    "@xmath3pt up to @xmath17 , four @xmath25 and seven @xmath17 lec appear in the results . however , some of them appear in particular combinations .",
    "therefore , effectively we have only five unknown constants",
    ". they can be fixed by fitting either to the phenomenological form factors obtained from neutrino bubble chamber data ( with several assumptions ) , to the results of other approaches , such as those of various quark models , or to the lattice qcd results@xcite . for a more detailed discussion ,",
