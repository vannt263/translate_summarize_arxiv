    "[ fig : bosonexchangeloop ] . a direct connection to the particle - hole diagrams of fig . [ fig : lambdaflow ] can be established on the bcs side and in the microscopic regime : there the boson gap @xmath90 is large . in this case , the effective fermion interaction in eq .",
    "becomes momentum independent , diagrammatically corresponding to a contracted bosonic propagator .",
    "the box diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : bosonexchangeloop ] is then equivalent to the particle - hole loop investigated in the last section with the pointlike approximation @xmath175 for the fermion interaction vertex .",
    "in contrast to the particle - particle fluctuations ( leading to ssb for decreasing @xmath126 ) , the particle - hole fluctuations lead only to quantitative corrections and depend only weakly on temperature .",
    "this can be checked explicitly in the pointlike approximation , and holds not only in the bcs regime where @xmath176 , but also for moderate @xmath177 as realized at the critical temperature in the unitary regime .",

    "after these preliminaries , we can now incorporate the effect of particle - hole fluctuations in the rg flow . in principle",
    "one could simply take @xmath142 as an additional coupling into account .",
    "however , it is much more elegant to use a scale - dependent hubbard - stratonovich transformation ( gies & wetterich 2001 ; pawlowski 2007 ; floerchinger & wetterich 2009 ) which absorbes @xmath142 into the yukawa - type interaction with the bosons at every scale @xmath51 . by construction",

    "since @xmath142 remains now zero during the flow , the effective four - fermion interaction @xmath181 is purely given by the boson exchange .",

    "breaking we use @xmath182    we emphasize that our non - perturbative flow equations go beyond the treatment by gorkov & melik - barkhudarov ( 1961 ) which includes the particle - hole diagrams only in a perturbative way .",
    "furthermore , the inner bosonic lines @xmath183 in the box diagrams include the center - of - mass momentum dependence of the four - fermion vertex .",
    "this is neglected in gorkov s pointlike treatment , and thus represents a further improvement of the classic calculation . actually , this momentum dependence becomes substantial away from the bcs regime where the physics of the bosonic bound state sets in .",
    "the continuous description of dynamically transmuting degrees of freedom is a particular strength of an rg description , as exemplified also in the context of qcd ( gies & wetterich 2004 , braun 2009 ) .",
    "in this section we aim at a systematic extension of the truncation scheme and consider a running fermion sector .",
