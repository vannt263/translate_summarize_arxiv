    "g. hori(1966,1967 ) applied a theorem by lie in canonical transformation to the theory of general perturbations .",
    "theorem is applicable to such cases where the undisturbed portion of hamiltonian depends on angular variable as well as momentum variables .",
    "a. deprit(1969 ) introduced the concept of lie series to the cases where the generating function itself depends explicitly on the small parameter .",
    "lie transforms define naturally a class of canonical mappings in the form of power series in the small parameter .",
    "they reviewed how a lie series defines a canonical mapping as a formal power series of a small parameter @xmath2 , provided the generating function itself does not depend upon @xmath2 .",
    "this restriction is overcome by introducing lie transform .",
    "they showed that how they naturally define the canonical transformations contemplated by von zeipel s method .",
    "canonical mappings defined by lie transforms as formal power series of a small parameter constitute the natural ingredient of transformation theory applied to hamiltonian systems .",
    "orbital stability of quasi - periodic motions in multidimensional hamiltonian systems was studied by sokolskii(1978 ) . with some applications to the birkhoff s normal form along with its generalized form by k. r. meyer ,",
    "the restricted problem of three bodies near @xmath3 , the birkhoff s normalization procedure , and the singular perturbation , of hamiltonian systems have been discussed by liu(1985 ) .",
    "meyer and d.s.schmidt(1986 ) established the full stability of lagrange equilibrium point in the planar restricted three body problem even in the case when @xmath4 .",
    "hamiltonian is normalised up to order six and then kam theory is applied .",
    "this establishes the stability of the equilibrium in degenerate case .",
    "markeev(1966 ) and k.t .",
    "alfriend(1970,1971 ) have shown that @xmath3 is unstable when the mass ratio is equal to @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the lie transform method is an efficient perturbation scheme which explicitly generates the functional form of the reduced hamiltonian under an implicitly defined canonical periodic near identity - transformation .",
    "coppola & rand(1989 ) applied a method of lie transforms , a perturbation method for differential equations to a general class of hamiltonian systems using computer algebra .",
    "they developed explicit formulas for transforming the system into birkhoff normal form .",
    "they formed explicit nonlinear stability criteria solely in terms of h for systems where the linear stability is inconclusive .",
    "they applied these results to the non - linear stability of @xmath3 in the circular rtbp . at @xmath3 , arnold s theorem(1961 ) must be used since a lyapunov function can not be found .",
    "they confirmed the previous computations of deprit and deprit bartholome ( 1967 ) , meyer and schmidt ( 1986 ) .",
    "algorithms of linear and nonlinear normalization of a hamiltonian system near an equilibrium point were described by maciejewski , and gozdziewski(1991 ) .",
    "a. jorba(1997 ) described the effective computation of normal forms , centre manifolds and first integrals in hamiltonian mechanics .",
    "these kind of conclusions are very useful .",
    "they allow , for example , to give explicit estimates on the diffusion time or to compute invariant tori .",
    "their approach presented here is based on using algebraic manipulation for the formal series but taking numerical co - efficients for them .",
    "j. palacian & p. yanguas ( 2000 ) described the reduction of perturbed hamiltonian systems .",
    "they used a technique based on lie - transformations . by extending an integral of the unperturbed part to the whole transformed system up to a certain order of approximation",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom of such a system is reduced , under certain conditions .",
    "the idea of reducing a perturbed system is valid not only for hamiltonians , but also for any system of differential equations .",
    "recently there has been a resurgence of this subject .",
    "the problem of building formal integrals for hamiltonian systems has received a wide treatment in the last forty five years .",
    "the results have been applied in fields such as molecular physics or astrodynamics .",
    "for example , in galactic models of three degrees of freedom , the search for third integral becomes very important to analyze the onset of chaos .",
    "their approach consists in generalising the concept of normal forms by selecting a function @xmath7 and proposing thereafter a symplectic change of variables",
    ".    the nonlinear stability of triangular equilibrium points was studied by kushvah et al ( 2007 ) in the generalised photogravitational restricted three body problem with poynting - robertson drag .",
    "they have performed first and second order normalization of the hamiltonian of the problem and applied kam theorem to examine the condition of non - linear stability .",
    "after computation they have found three critical mass ratios and concluded that triangular points are stable in the nonlinear sense except three critical mass ratios at which kam theorem fails .",
    "hence , we thought to examine the non - linear stability of @xmath0 , equilibrium point of non - planar photogravitational restricted three body problem with oblate smaller primary .",
    "we examined the linear stability of above problem in shankaran(2011 ) where @xmath8 is radiation pressure of bigger primary and @xmath9 that of smaller .",
    "we have found that @xmath0 is unstable due to positive real part in complex roots .",
    "now , we proceed to normalize the hamiltonian of the problem as in coppola and rand ( 1989 ) using lie transform .",
    "we transformed the system into birkhoff s normal form .",
    "using arnold s theorem , we have found non - linear stability criteria in terms of h. lie transforms reduce the system to an equivalent simpler system which is immediately solvable .",
    "finally we find that @xmath10 hence , according to arnold theorem , we conclude that @xmath0 is stable .",
    "we plotted graphs for @xmath1 they are rectangular hyperbola .",
    "we suppose that @xmath12 is the radiation co - efficient of bigger primary and @xmath13 that of smaller primary in photogravitational non - planar restricted three body problem .",
    "we want to apply arnold s theorem(1961 ) .",
    "we applied method of lie transform using computer algebra as given in research article of coppola and rand(1989 ) .",
    "we suppose @xmath14 and @xmath15,(where @xmath16 ) be the operators .",
    "then we transformed the near - identity transformation @xmath17 to @xmath18 variables .",
    "the kamiltonian is given by    @xmath19 \\quad n=2,3,4\\dots\\ ] ]    we choose the generating function @xmath20 in such a way so as to best simplify kamiltonian and each term to be canceled will be of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "we choose @xmath20 to be a sum of terms , one for each term to be canceled , of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the basic frequencies which are rationally independent and we suppose that the frequency in vertical direction is constant i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 then @xmath31 will be infinite hence the terms @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath11 is given as ( please see coppola and rand(1989 ) )    @xmath33    we performed computation using mathematica and found the following results :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    where + @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43^{5/2};$ ]    @xmath44^{5/2};}$ ]    @xmath45^{5/2};}$ ]    @xmath46^{5/2};}$ ]    @xmath47^{5/2};}$ ]    @xmath48^{5/2};}$ ]    @xmath49^{5/2};}$ ]    from above results @xmath11 upto first order in @xmath22 is    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53 using all the values of coefficients and algebraic manipulations we get the following expression for @xmath11 : + @xmath54    we have computed the value of @xmath11 numerically for various values of parameters when @xmath55 and @xmath56.the graphs are plotted @xmath11 versus @xmath26 . in figures [ fig : fig1 ] , plot i , ii , iii represent the respective values of @xmath57 , and @xmath58 respectively when @xmath59 fixed and the vertical line shown in each graph is an asymptote .",
    "effect of @xmath60 in which first three curves are for @xmath61 and second three curves belong to @xmath62 .",
    "similarly we have also obtained the effect of @xmath8 in figure [ fig : fig2 ] in which plot i and ii correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath58 respectively when @xmath64 fixed . here",
