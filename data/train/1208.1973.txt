    "conjecture [ conj : k3a ] would also follow from its validity for all @xmath47 for the k3 surface alone . here",
    "we note a remarkable coincidence : the series on the rhs of the above formula appears in the work of @xcite on computing descendant invariants in the ( reduced ) gromov - witten or stable pairs theory of a k3 surface .",

    "then the caporaso - harris recursion determines the degrees @xmath106 of the loci of curves with @xmath24 nodes and satisfying the tangency conditions @xmath105 .",

    "if @xmath27 is an unnodal del pezzo surface , they coincide with the welschinger invariants , real analogues of the gromov - witten invariants .",
