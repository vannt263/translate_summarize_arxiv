    "the new particle discovered at the lhc in 2012 was identified as a higgs boson  @xcite . with the current lhc data , its measured properties are consistent with those of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm )  @xcite . on the other hand , so far , no evidence for new physics beyond the sm has been found directly at the lhc .",
    "therefore , our standard picture for high energy particle phenomena , which is based on the gauge theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking , seems successful .",
    "however , it has been well known that the higgs sector in the sm is problematic from the theoretical viewpoint .",
    "first of all , the existence of the scalar boson causes the hierarchy problem  @xcite , so that many physicists try to understand the essence of the higgs boson , e.g. , elementary or composite particle . in order to solve the hierarchy problem ,",
    "several scenarios for the new paradigm have been introduced such as supersymmetry , dynamical symmetry breaking and extra dimensions .",
    "each of them gives a different answer for the question of essence of the higgs boson .",
    "second , there is no principle for the structure of the higgs sector , so that the minimal higgs sector adopted in the sm is just an assumption .",
    "there are many possibilities of non - minimal higgs sectors with additional scalar fields such as singlets , doublets and triplets .",
    "a model based on the above - discussed paradigms can predict the specific structure and property of the higgs sector .",
    "for example , the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) predicts the higgs sector with two isospin doublet scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "in addition , non - minimal higgs sectors can also be introduced in new physics models to explain the origin of neutrino masses , the existence of dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the universe , _ et cetera _ , which can not be explained in the sm .",
    "each new physics model predicts a characteristic structure for the higgs sector .",
    "therefore , if the higgs sector is determined by experiments in future , the new physics scenario can be selected from many candidates .    to probe the extended higgs sectors , the simplest way is to directly search for additional higgs bosons such as the second scalar boson . by measuring its properties",
    "; e.g. , the mass , the electric charge , the spin and the parity , important information to reconstruct the higgs sector can be extracted .",
    "non - observation of the second higgs boson gives the experimental constraint on the parameter space in the higgs sector .",
    "current bounds from searches for additional higgs bosons at the lhc with the collision energy of 7 and 8 tev can be found in refs .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the direct search results , precision measurements of various low energy observables can be an indirect search for extended higgs sectors , since the existence of additional higgs multiplets can affect them .",
    "the electroweak rho parameter defined in terms of the masses of the @xmath1 boson @xmath2 and the @xmath3 boson @xmath4 , and the weak mixing angle @xmath5 by @xmath6 is one of the most important tools to constrain the structure of the higgs sector , whose experimental value is very close to unity ; i.e. , @xmath7  @xcite . in the sm , the rho parameter is predicted to be unity at the tree level . in general , in extended higgs sectors , predicted values for the rho parameter can deviate from unity . in the higgs sector with arbitrary number of scalar fields @xmath8 ( a hypercharge @xmath9 and an isospin @xmath10 ) with vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath11 , the rho parameter is calculated at the tree level by  @xcite @xmath12\\ , v_i^2 } { 2\\,\\sum_i y_i^2\\ , v_i^2}.   \\label{eq : rho_tree } \\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_tree ] ) , an additional vev of a higgs field satisfying with @xmath13 does not change the value of the rho parameter from the sm , doublets with @xmath14 and septets with @xmath15 .",
    "the next possibility to the septet representation is isospin 26-plet with @xmath16 . ] .",
    "a vev of a higgs multiplet without satisfying the above equation ; e.g. , a triplet higgs field , deviates @xmath17 from unity , so that we need finetuning for such a vev to avoid the constraint from @xmath18 . however , even if the above equation is not satisfied , by allowing an alignment among vevs , we can keep @xmath19 . the simplest realization is known as the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite whose higgs sector is composed of additional real and complex triplet fields with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the above discussion is very useful to discriminate extended higgs sectors .",
    "however , the rho parameter has been measured quite precisely , so that we need to take into account quantum effects to the rho parameter .",
    "let us discuss how the rho parameter is modified at the one - loop level .",
    "the deviation of the rho parameter from unity measures the violation of the custodial @xmath22 symmetry  @xcite in the sector of particles in the loop , we need a different prescription for the calculation of the radiative corrections to the rho parameter from that in models with @xmath23 , because of an additional input parameter in the electroweak sector . in the higgs sector with a real triplet higgs field with @xmath24 , one - loop corrections to the rho parameter have been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite . that has been applied to the higgs sector with a complex triplet higgs field with @xmath25 in refs .  @xcite . in the gm model",
    ", although @xmath19 can be satisfied , similar prescription in models with @xmath26 is necessary due to the vev alignment  @xcite . ] .",
    "for example , in the yukawa lagrangian , the custodial symmetry is broken by the mass splitting between the top and bottom quarks . as a result",
    ", the deviation of the rho parameter from unity @xmath27 due to the loop contribution of the top and bottom quarks takes a form of @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath29 , there remains @xmath30 dependence in @xmath31 . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs potential in the sm respects the custodial symmetry , so that the higgs boson loop contribution is at most the logarithmic dependence of the higgs boson mass through the hypercharge gauge interaction .",
    "however , in general , the custodial symmetry is broken in extended higgs sectors .",
    "for example , in two higgs doublet models ( thdms ) , the mass splitting between singly - charged higgs bosons and a cp - odd higgs boson gives a quadratic mass dependence similarly to the top and bottom quark contributions in @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a sizable amount of the mass difference has already been excluded  @xcite . in the above way",
    ", we can take bounds on various physical parameters by comparing precisely measured observables with theory predictions with radiative corrections .",
    "experimental data for flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes such as @xmath32 and the @xmath33-@xmath34 mixing strongly constrain extended higgs sectors with multi - doublet structures .",
    "the way to avoid such dangerous fcnc processes at the tree level is to assign a different quantum number for each higgs doublet .",
    "consequently , each quark or lepton can obtain its mass from only one higgs doublet just like in the sm , and therefore the model escapes fcnc processes at the tree level . in the thdm , for example , this can be achieved by imposing a discrete @xmath0 symmetry to the model  @xcite as the simplest way , which can be softly - broken in the potential .",
    "there are four independent types of yukawa interactions under the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite , which are called as type - i , type - ii , type - x and type - y  @xcite .",
    "how can we explore extended higgs sectors ?",
    "it is important to understand that in general , a new scale @xmath35 is introduced in extended higgs sectors , which is irrelevant to the vev of the higgs boson .",
    "when @xmath35 is much larger than the tev scale , the mass of the second higgs boson is approximately given by @xmath35 . in this case , the second higgs boson is too heavy to be discovered directly at the lhc .",
    "in addition , the indirect effect of new particles decouples from the low energy observables  @xcite such as the coupling constants of the discovered higgs boson .",
    "however , if @xmath35 is as high as the tev scale , there can be two possibilities in searches for additional higgs bosons .",
    "the first possibility is that the second higgs boson can be discovered directly at the lhc . in this case",
    ", the properties can be directly measured at the lhc , and the useful information to determine the structure of the higgs sector can also be obtained at the high luminosity ( hl)-lhc  @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is that it can not be discovered directly , but its indirect effect on the higgs couplings can be significant and thus detectable by precision measurements at the hl - lhc and at the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .",
    "it goes without saying that in order to realize the second possibility a small but detectable mixing between the sm - like higgs boson and an additional higgs boson is required . in this case ,",
    "in addition to obtaining information on the mass of the second higgs boson , the structure of the higgs sector could be determined without the direct discovery by finding the pattern in deviations in various higgs boson couplings  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath35 stays at the electroweak scale , a large mixing between the sm - like higgs boson and an additional higgs boson can occur , and the higgs boson couplings can deviate significantly from the sm values .",
    "if the last scenario is realized , both the direct search and the indirect search are possible to determine the higgs sector .",
    "the direct search for additional higgs bosons in thdms at the lhc has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite after the discovery of the higgs boson .",
    "the complementarity of additional higgs boson searches at the lhc and at the ilc is recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss how the structure of the higgs sector can be determined at the lhc and at the ilc .",
    "in particular , we shed light on complementarity of direct searches of additional higgs bosons at the upcoming 13 tev or 14 tev run of the lhc and precision measurements of the coupling constants of the discovered higgs boson at future collider experiments .",
    "we consider extended higgs sectors which satisfy @xmath36 without predicting fcncs at the tree level ; i.e. , the thdm with the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry , the doublet - singlet model  @xcite , the gm model  @xcite and the doublet - septet model  @xcite . for the thdm , we discuss the four types of yukawa interaction .",
    "we at first give a detailed explanation for properties in the thdms such as the decay branching ratio , perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability .",
    "we then analyze the direct search for additional neutral higgs bosons at the lhc .",
    "the expected excluded regions on the mass of extra neutral higgs bosons are shown assuming the 14 tev energy at the lhc .",
    "next , as the indirect search , we show various patterns of deviations in the gauge interaction @xmath37 and the yukawa interactions @xmath38 of the sm - like higgs boson @xmath39 from the sm predictions .",
    "we show the deviation in the @xmath38 couplings in the thdms . for the rest models",
    ", we also show those in the @xmath38 and @xmath37 couplings , where these models predict universal modifications for the @xmath38 couplings .",
    "we use the latest results of allowed values of the higgs boson couplings which have been obtained from the global fit to all higgs data  @xcite in order to compare the various prediction of deviations in the higgs boson couplings and @xmath37 couplings in the thdms and in the models with universal modification of the @xmath38 couplings .",
    "we update the plots for the @xmath38 and @xmath37 couplings with more detailed explanations by using the latest data  @xcite . ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the higgs potential and yukawa lagrangian in the thdm with the softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry . after we derive the yukawa couplings in the four types , we discuss the decay branching ratios of the higgs bosons .",
    "the bounds from unitarity and vacuum stability are also discussed . in section iii , we study the direct search for the additional higgs bosons at the lhc . in section iv , we present expected accuracy of the precise measurement of the higgs boson couplings at the ilc , and then we discuss the deviation in the sm - like higgs boson couplings are calculated in the thdms and models with universal yukawa couplings .",

    "we note that these extended higgs sectors can predict larger deviations in the @xmath37 couplings as compared to those in models with @xmath70 , because an amount of the deviation depends on an additional vev whose magnitude is constrained by the rho parameter if it causes @xmath70 .    in the doublet - singlet model and the doublet - septet model , an isospin singlet field with @xmath24 and an isospin septet field with @xmath71",

    "a key role is taken by the deviation in the coupling constant of @xmath39 to weak gauge bosons from the sm prediction , @xmath102 . when non - zero @xmath103 is found at future colliders , that is identified as an evidence of non - standard effects mainly due to additional higgs bosons . by combining the theoretical constraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability",

    "even in such a situation , as we have shown in the last section , the model discrimination and parameter determination will be still possible by utilizing only the fingerprinting of the deviation of the couplings of @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , an upper limit of the mass scale of additional higgs bosons can be set by the constraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability , while the lower limit is given by the direct search at the lhc .",

    "the complementarity between the direct searches and the indirect searches can be understood to identify the non - minimal higgs sector .",
    "observation of the deviation in the coupling constant of the sm - like higgs boson to the weak gauge bosons plays a key role , which also affects the strategy of the direct search of additional higgs bosons at colliders .",
    "first of all , we have to keep in mind that there exists a decoupling limit in extended higgs sectors in the limit of @xmath131 , where the sm is a good description as a low energy effective theory up to much higher scales than the electroweak scale .",
    "on the other hand , if a relatively large deviation of @xmath103 is observed , the mass scale of the additional higgs bosons is bounded from the above by using the argument of perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability , so that the direct discovery of them can be highly expected .",
    "if a small deviation is observed at the ilc , the direct discovery of the additional higgs boson can be difficult .",
    "even in such a situation , the fingerprinting of the sm - like higgs boson couplings can be a solid and powerful tool to explore the extended higgs sector .",

    "<S> after the discovery of the standard - model - like higgs boson at the lhc , the structure of the higgs sector remains unknown . </S>",

    "<S> first of all , we evaluate expected excluded regions for the mass of additional neutral higgs bosons from direct searches at the lhc with the 14 tev collision energy in the two higgs doublet models with a softly - broken @xmath0 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> second , precision measurements of the higgs boson couplings at future experiments can be used for the indirect search of extended higgs sectors if measured coupling constant with the gauge boson slightly deviates from the standard model value . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> in the two higgs doublet model with the softly - broken discrete symmetry , there are four types of yukawa interactions , so that they can be discriminated by measuring the pattern of deviations in yukawa coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we can fingerprint various extended higgs sectors with future precision data by detecting the pattern of deviations in the coupling constants of the standard - model - like higgs boson . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how the pattern of deviations can be different among various higgs sectors which predict the electroweak rho parameter to be unity ; such as models with additional an isospin singlet , a doublet , triplets or a septet . we conclude that as long as the gauge coupling constant of the higgs boson slightly differs from the standard model prediction but is enough to be detected at the lhc and its high - luminosity run or at the international linear collider , we can identify the non - minimal higgs sector even without direct discovery of additional higgs bosons at the lhc . </S>"
