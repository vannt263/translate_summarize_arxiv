    "spectroscopy , including the spectrum and the corresponding wave functions , is a very interesting topic for heavy quarkonia in particle physics .",
    "the spectrum and the corresponding wave functions for the binding systems can be tested experimentally and via study of the spectroscopy one may have insight of the heavy quarkonia and understand qcd , which is the nature of the binding , further as well . in the literature , there are various approaches to the spectroscopy of the heavy quarkonia : charmonium and bottomonium @xcite , and to solve the bethe - salpeter ( b.s . )",
    "equation is one of them @xcite . since recently we have realized a new method to solve the b.s .",
    "equation for the heavy quarkonia , so in this paper , we would like to try the method i.e. to apply this method to re - analyzing the spectroscopy of the heavy quarkoia : charmonium and bottomonium under b.s . equation approach .",
    "first of all , how to determine the b.s .",
    "kernel is crucial for b.s .",
    "equation approach to a bound state problem .",
    "it is known that if one adopts the qcd - inspired bethe - salpeter ( b.s . )",
    "equation @xcite approach to the problems of hadronic bound states , then the relevant b.s .",
    "kernel for a double heavy quark - antiquark system , such as charmonium and bottomonium , is instantaneous approximately i.e. the b.s .",
    "equation is essentially an instantaneous one ( a bs - in equation ) .",
    "it is also known that bs - in equation can further precisely relate to the schdinger equation in potential model ( pm ) by means of the salpeter approximate method @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may use the relation to the potential model ( pm ) and help oneself to determine the kernel of bs - in equation precisely . whereas starting with the bs - in equation whose kernel is fixed in terms of qcd consideration and the relation to pm",
    ", one can extend some relativistic nature of the problem more than what pm can consider , and stand on more solid theoretical ground for the b.s .",
    "equation approach , hence , we start the study of spectroscopy for heavy quarkia with such a bs - in equation .",
    "moreover , we apply the new realized method to solving the bs - in equation .",
    "people later on will see an important issue from the new method is that besides the ` fine and hyperfine ' splitting being involved , the wave mixtures in the wave functions , such as @xmath0 wave mixing in @xmath1 ( @xmath6 : total angle momentum ; @xmath7 : parity ; @xmath8 : charge parity ) states and @xmath2 wave mixing in @xmath3 states etc , are determined precisely , although the mixtures , in fact , are rooted in the kernel under the present framework of bs - in equation .",
    "the new proposed method can be outlined as that , firstly we analyze the bound states according to their total angular momentum @xmath6 , parity @xmath7 and charge conjugation @xmath8 , such as the states @xmath9(@xmath10 ) , @xmath11(@xmath12 or @xmath13 ) , @xmath14(@xmath15 ) , @xmath16(@xmath17 ) , @xmath18(@xmath19 or @xmath20 ) , and @xmath21(@xmath22 ) etc ; secondly we write down the most general formulation for the b.s .",
    "wave functions respectively , and then input the formulated wave functions into the bs - in equation and turn the equation into a set of proper coupled equations for the components which appear in the formulation ; finally we solve the coupled equation numerically , and obtain the mass spectra and wave functions for ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) binding systems . for convenience ,",
    "we call the coupled equations as bs - coeqs later on .    this paper is organized as following , additional to the introduction section i , in section ii we introduce the relativistic bethe - salpeter equation and bs - in equation . in section iii",
    "we start with the generalized formulation for relativistic wave functions with definite quantum numbers to derive the relevant bs - coeqs for low total angle momentum states individually .",
    "finally , we show the numerical results although we do not present the detail to solve the equation numerically , and we also explain and briefly discuss the obtained solutions of the bs - coeqs in section iv .",
    "firstly let us outline the reduction of the b.s .",
    "equation which is similar to the way of salpeter @xcite if b.s .",
    "kernel is instantaneous , and introduce necessary notations .",
    "the readers , who are interested in the details , can also find them in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bethe - salpeter ( b.s . ) equation for mesons is read as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the b.s .",
    "wave function , @xmath27 is the interaction kernel between the quark and antiquark , and @xmath28 are the momenta of the quark 1 and anti - quark 2 .",
    "quark mass is @xmath29 , antiquark mass is @xmath30 , and here we consider heavy quarkonia : charmonium and bottomonium so we have @xmath31 .",
    "the total momentum @xmath7 and the relative momentum @xmath32 are defined as : @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 for charmonium and bottomonium .",
    "we divide the relative momentum @xmath32 into two parts , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 @xmath39 correspondingly , we may have two lorentz invariant variables :    @xmath40    when @xmath41 , they turn to the usual component @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .    if the kernel @xmath27 takes the simple form : @xmath44 namely the b.s .",
    "equation is ` instantaneous ' , for convenience , we would like to introduce the notations @xmath45 and @xmath46 so the ` instantaneous ( three dimensional ) objects ' will accordingly read as follows : @xmath47 @xmath48 the b.s .",
    "equation now is rewritten as : @xmath49 generally the propagators of the two constituents can be decomposed as : @xmath50 with @xmath51\\ ; , \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 for quark and anti - quark respectively , and @xmath53 , and @xmath54 satisfy the relations : @xmath55 hence sometimes @xmath54 are called as ` project operators ' , although they need to be sandwiched with the operator @xmath56 when ` projecting ' as eq([eq9 ] ) .    introducing the notations @xmath57 to note the projected wave functions as : @xmath58 and we indeed have @xmath59 with contour integration over @xmath60 on both sides of eq.([eq6 ] ) , we obtain : @xmath61 and the equation becomes four independent equations : @xmath62 where we have @xmath63 for the equal mass system .",
    "in fact the four equations is of an ` eigenvalue problem ' about the eigenvalue @xmath64 .",
    "note that in the ref.@xcite the way for solving the bs - in equation is not exactly equivalent to the four equations eq.([eq11 ] ) .",
    "details about examining the equivalence may be found in ref.@xcite . alternately here",
    "we exactly start with the four equations to solve the bs - in equation .",
    "the normalization condition for b.s .",
    "wave function is : @xmath65=2p_{0}\\;. \\label{eq12}\\ ] ]    now let us return to the problem for the heavy quarkonia ( @xmath66 ) and ( @xmath67 ) . to fix the kernel for the heavy quark and heavy anti - quark ,",
    "on one hand , we should let the kernel being qcd - inspired and on the other hand , we should relate the kernel to the cornell potential accordingly .",
    "thus the kernel in space - time looks like as a linear scalar interaction ( the confinement one in qcd nonperturbative nature ) plus a vector interaction ( single gluon exchange in coulomb gauge ) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the string constant , @xmath70 is the running coupling constant of qcd .",
    "usually , in order to fit the data of heavy quarkonia , a constant @xmath71 is often added to the scalar confining potential and takes different values for the bound states with different quantum numbers respectively is determined by fitting the data for the ground states with the corresponding quantum numbers . ] .    to avoid the infrared divergence in the coulomb - like one and to correspond the fact that the confined linear interaction should be also suppressed at large distance phenomenologically ,",
    "so it will be better to re - formulate the kernel as follows : @xmath72 to decrease the parameters which are needed to fix by fitting data , we assume @xmath73 approximately and @xmath74 vary in reasonable region . ] .",
    "it is easy to show that when @xmath75 , the potential approximately becomes linear . now",
    "kernel in momentum space and in the rest frame of the bound state is read as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 for ( @xmath23 ) system , @xmath78 for ( @xmath24 ) system ; the constants @xmath69 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath71 and @xmath81 are the parameters which characterize the kernel ( potential ) .",
    "in fact in this section , we show the new realized method to solve a bs - in equation , but specifically apply to the concerned heavy quarkonium problem .",
    "firstly , according to the total angle momentum ( @xmath6 ) , parity ( @xmath7 ) and charge conjugation ( @xmath8 ) of the concerned bound state , we write down the most general formulation for each of the relativistic b.s .",
    "wave functions , and then we put it into eq.([eq11 ] ) to derive out the coupled equation for the components appearing in the formulation , bs - coeq .",
    "in the below subsections , we do the derivation for the low - laying states : @xmath82 in turn precisely .      since the bound states with the quantum numbers @xmath84 and @xmath16 are similar , so in this subsection we derive the equations for them in turn .",

    "usually , the parameters are fixed by fitting the best experimental data . since now quite a lot of data about the charmonium and bottomnium with quantum data @xmath1 are available and quite precise , so the most parameters are fixed by the data .",
    "since @xmath71 in the kernel originates from qcd non - perturbative effects , its value is to account the states with various @xmath192 , so we fix it by fitting the mass of the ground states .",

    "some are @xmath151-wave dominant and the others are @xmath7-wave dominant .",
    "the third one of charmonium with @xmath245mev below the threshold of ` open - charm ' , for instance , clearly is a @xmath156-wave dominant state , and in its decay into @xmath246 , @xmath247 only its @xmath151-wave components play a role , so the fraction width of the pure leptonic decay is comparatively small .",
    "indeed it corresponds to the observed one @xmath248 ( with mass @xmath249mev ) as pointed in @xcite . whereas , similarly there is wave mixture for bottomonium too , for instance , once more the third one of bottomonium with @xmath250mev below the threshold of ` open - bottom ' is also a @xmath156-wave dominant state and it decays into @xmath251 only via its @xmath151-wave components , so the fractional width of the pure leptonic decay is comparatively small too .",
    "furthermore , the fractional width of the pure leptonic decay for such a state will be comparatively much smaller ( a quarter ) than that of charmonium , due to the two factors that the charge of bottom - quark is smaller than that of charm - quark , and the comparative weight of the @xmath151-wave component to the @xmath156-wave component in the @xmath156-wave dominant state , which is proportional to @xmath252 ( @xmath253 ) as indicated in eq.([eq1330 ] ) ) , is small .",
    "therefore such a state is very difficult to be observed either in @xmath5 energy scanning experiments at cleo and b - factories ( due to low production rate ) or in hadron colliders ( due to very small branching ratio for the lepton pair decay and various backgrounds etc ) .",
    "we believe that all such @xmath156-wave dominant states for bottomonium must be still missing in experiments so far , even if our prediction here is true .",
    "we conjecture that such states may be observed at z - factory such as giga - z etc elsewhere via @xmath254 or @xmath255 , because there the backgrounds can be controlled comparatively easy , and numerous such bottomonium states enough for experimental observation can be produced via on - shell @xmath4-boson @xcite . for the @xmath2 wave mixture , since the first state with quantum numbers @xmath3 is a ` high ' excited state already so there are only fewer of the @xmath3 states below the threshold of ` open - charm ' or ` open - bottom ' , thus there are fewer example states which can be used to test the wave mixture , although the tests and the situation essentially are quite similar to the cases of @xmath11 states for @xmath0 wave mixture .",
    "when the bound states does not consist of a pair of quark and antiquark ( not as charmonium and bottomonium here ) , the quantum number @xmath8 is not a good one , then the present way to solve the problem ( the relevant b.s .",
    "equation ) should be changed accordingly , but its main steps may be still kept and interesting results , which are different from the present , are obtained finally .",
    "in fact we have considered the double heavy system ( @xmath256 ) or ( @xmath257 ) as an example for non-(quark - antiquark ) binding system and solved the relevant b.s .",
    "equation in a similar way , but due to differences we put the results and discussions about the double heavy system ( @xmath256 ) or ( @xmath257 ) elsewhere in ref.@xcite .",
