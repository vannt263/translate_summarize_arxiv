    "the desire for single - shot ultrafast electron diffraction ( ued ) beamlines ( @xmath11 100 fs , @xmath12 electrons ) capable of imaging molecular and atomic motion continues to push the development of both photocathode and cold atom electron sources @xcite . in the case of photoemission sources , advances in the development of low mean transverse energy ( mte ) photocathodes @xcite , as well as both dc gun and normal conducting rf gun technology @xcite , now bring the goal of creating single shot electron diffraction beamlines with lengths on the order of meters with in reach .    for such devices , the required charge and beam sizes at the cathode imply transporting a strongly space charged dominated beam .",
    "building on the successful application of multi - objective genetic algorithm ( moga ) optimized simulations of space charge dominated beams used in the design and operation of the cornell photoinjector @xcite , we apply the same techniques to a moderate energy dc gun followed by two solenoids and a ncrf buncher cavity @xcite .",
    "we use the smallest mtes considered achievable given the excellent vacuum environment provided by this gun technology .",
    "in particular , recent work points to the ability to reduce the cathode mte via cooling of the cathode @xcite , and data suggests cathode mtes as low as 5 mev ( cathode emittance of 0.1 @xmath3m / mm ) may be possible using multi - akali antimonide cathodes cooled to 20 k.    this work is structured as follows : first , we briefly review the definition of coherence and the expected scaling with critical initial laser and beam parameters .",
    "next , a detailed description of the beamline set - up , and the parameters for optimization is given .",
    "the results of an initial round of optimizations of the emittance vs. bunch charge , as well as detailed optimizations of the coherence length vs. final bunch length at several final beam sizes ( @xmath13 25 , 50 , 100 @xmath3 m ) and bunch charges ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 electrons ) follow . from the optimal fronts , examples for @xmath14 @xmath3 m",
    "are simualted for both final charges , and the dynamics in each case discussed .",
    "the transverse coherence length is defined as @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath16 nm is the _ reduced _ compton wavelength of the electron . in this and",
    "all subsequent expressions , all fields and particle distributions are assumed symmetric about the beam line ( @xmath17 ) axis .",
    "rewriting the coherence length in terms of the ( normalized ) emittance @xmath18 gives @xmath19 for a beam passing through a waist this expression reduces to @xcite @xmath20 to determine how this quantity scales with the critical initial beam parameters and accelerating field requires relating the initial and final emittances .",
    "factoring out any emittance degrading effects occurring during transport allows one to write the emittance as : @xmath21 where the factor",
    "@xmath22 $ ] determines the degree of emittance preservation .",
    "in general , @xmath23 depends strongly on the space charge dynamics along the beamline , which in turn are determined by the initial and final required beam sizes .",
    "nonetheless , using this and the expression for the emittance at the cathode @xmath24 , the coherence length can be written in terms of the magnification @xmath25 from cathode to sample as well as the initial coherence length : @xmath26 the mean transverse energy ( mte ) of the emitted electrons determines the initial coherence length @xcite : @xmath27 while the charge saturation limit , set by the desired extractable charge and cathode field , determines the size of the laser pulse .",
    "following @xcite , we write the aspect ratio of the photoemitted beam as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 gives the approximate length of the beam at the time of emission in terms of the field at the cathode @xmath30 and the laser pulse length @xmath31 . in the charge saturation limit , this yields : @xmath32 thus , the coherence length scales as : @xmath33 for beams with a large degree of emittance preservation , @xmath34 , and the above expression gives the correct scaling @xcite .",
    "both limits in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lcxscale ] ) make clear that given a desired final spot size @xmath35 , and charge @xmath36 at the sample , maximizing coherence length requires larger cathode fields as well as smaller mtes . in this work , we seek to document the best coherence length achievable from photogun systems delivering the best in mte technology . to that end",
    ", we simulate a dc gun set - up , derived from the design of a 250 kv dc gun featuring a 20 mm cathode - anode gap , and a novel cryo - cooled photocathode system capable of cooling multi - alkali cathodes to 20 k under design and construction at cornell university . for this work ,",
    "we specify the same gun geometry and a slightly lower gun voltage of 225 kv , in part guided by the empirical data on voltage breakdown and previous voltage demonstration figures for dc guns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : voltage_vs_gap ] @xcite .",
    "recently alkali antimonide photocathodes cooled to 90 k produced mtes as low as a 15 mev @xcite .",
    "we anticipate mtes of a few mev may be achievable in the new cryogun system , and thus , for simplicity , we assume a cathode mte of 5 mev for all simulations for this beamline .    to model the gun fields , we use an analytic expression for the potential of a plate conductor with a hole in it immersed in a constant background field . for this system ,",
    "the potential is approximately : @xmath37 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\rho(r , z ) & = & \\sqrt{\\lambda(r , z)^2 + 4(z - l)^2/r^2 } , \\nonumber",
    "\\\\ \\lambda(r , z ) & = & \\frac{1}{r^2}[(z - l)^2+r^2]-1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath30 is the field at the cathode .",
    "this solution becomes exact in the limit that the cathode - anode gap goes to infinity , and remains a good approximation provided that the radius of the anode hole is much greater than the gap ( @xmath38 ) . here",
    ", the radius of the anode hole is 2.5 mm ( compared to 20 mm for the gap ) , and the relative voltage error across the cathode is @xmath39 1% : @xmath40 for this field set - up , the 225 kv gun voltage corresponds to a roughly 11 mv / m accelerating field at the cathode .",
    "[ fig : cgunlayout ] shows the overall layout of the cryogun beamline . this setup features a 3 ghz normal conducting buncher cavity for final bunch compression , as well as two solenoid magnets @xcite . for the buncher fields",
    ", we used the same 3 ghz field map as the eindhoven design @xcite ( a new 3 ghz design is currently underway at cornell ) .",
    "the solenoid field maps were created by scaling down the existing cornell photoinjector fields by a factor of two .",
    "we then fit the analytic form for the on - axis solenoid field from a sheet of current with radius @xmath41 and length @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , to the solenoid field maps , and created a custom gpt element featuring the analytic result of the off - axis expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : solfield ] ) to third order in the radial offset @xmath45 .",
    "we note here that given the small beam sizes along each set - up ( @xmath46 mm ) determined by the optimizer , the first - order expansion of the solenoid fields accurately describes the beam dynamics through both beamlines .",
    "additionally , use of such small mte values requires estimating the effect of disorder induced heating ( dih ) near the cathode .",
    "this issue is discussed later in the results section .",
    "in order to produce the best coherence length performance from the cryogun ued setup , multi - objective genetic optimizations were performed using general particle tracer and the same optimization software used previously in @xcite . for these simulations ,",
    "the optimizer varied the laser rms sizes , beamline element parameters and positions .",
    "additionally , the optimizer was allowed to arbitrarily shape both the transverse and longitudinal laser distributions , based on the same method described in @xcite .",
    "table-[tab : beamline_params ] displays the beamline parameters varied for each setup .        in order to get a better feel of the beam dynamics determined by the coherence length optimizations",
    ", we ran several example solutions from the coherence vs. final bunch length fronts shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : elvst ] . from these , we present two examples , one for each of the final charges . in all cases shown ,",
    "the final sample radius was @xmath47 @xmath3 m .",
    "the final rms bunch lengths was set to @xmath48 100 fs and 200 fs for the lower / higher final charge , respectively .",
    "table-[tab : resparams ] displays the resulting relevant beam parameters .",
    "fig.[fig : cgun_stdx ] shows the transverse rms beamsize along the cryogun beamline , as well as the initial transverse laser profile and the final electron beam transverse distribution at the sample for both bunch charges .",
    "the optimizer chose a roughly flattop transverse laser profile with @xmath49 @xmath3 m for both final charges .",
    "the clipping at the sample produces a roughly flattop transverse electron beam distribution , validating the approximation @xmath50 used to compute the relative coherence lengths in table-[tab : lcxopt ] .",
    "the optimizer chose a smaller transmission @xmath51 for the smaller final charge @xmath52 electrons , with @xmath53% transmission . at @xmath54 electrons ,",
    "the optimizer clipped fewer particles , resulting in a transmission of @xmath55% .",
    "[ fig : cgun_stdt ] shows the rms bunch length , and the initial temporal current profile produced by the laser , and the electron beam current profile at the sample .",
    "the use of the buncher cavity allows for a fairly constant bunch length along the beamline up to the cavity , where the buncher applies an energy chirp which results in the bunch being compressed by the time it reaches the screen .",
    "the optimizer chose a roughly flattop longitudinal initial laser distribution for the lower charge , and a sloped distribution at the higher charge . from the transverse and longitudinal rms data , the initial electron beam volume and aspect ratio follow , which allows for the estimation of the of disordered induced heating near the cathode surface , as well which scaling law regime from eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lcxscale ] ) should apply to the dynamics . in both cases , we assume a uniform beam with equivalent rms sizes . from this , the volume follows : @xmath56}\\sigma_x^2(c\\sigma_t)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this to compute the electron number density for each of the example cases yields @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) @xmath59 for the final charges at the sample of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) electrons respectively . from this",
    "we estimate the effect of disordered induced heating using the formula given by maxson : @xmath60   = 1.04\\times10^{-9}(n_0 \\hspace{0.1cm}[m^{-3}])^{1/3}$ ] @xcite , where @xmath61 is the electron number density . for the examples ,",
    "this yields a dih effect of 0.75 and 1.6 mev for the lower / higher final sample charge , or roughly 15% and 32% of the original 5 mev cathode mte .",
    "computing the initial electron beam aspect ratio yields @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) with a final charge of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) electrons , respectively . as anticipated from the emittance optimizations , the cryogun produces best performance when operating in the long initial electron beam limit .",
    "as the emittance performance largely determines the optimal coherence length , we also plot both the transverse projected and average slice emittance along each beamline for each final charge . for the slice emittance calculation , each simulation was run with 30k macroparticles , and binned using 20 longitudinal slices along the bunch .",
    "the emittance in slice , @xmath64 , was computed and then the average over the slices taken to get a single number representative of the slice data .",
    "[ fig : enx_cgun1 ] shows the emittances computed using the lower final charge for cryogun .",
    "shown in the insets are the initial and final horizontal phase spaces in both cases .",
    "the space charge induced rotation of the slices grows the projected emittance along the beamline up to the point of the last solenoid before the sample , which is used to send the beam through a waist , aligning the slices in the process .",
    "we point out that the emittance drops following the eventual slice realignment due to the second solenoid .",
    "however , the emittance blows up again as the beam is compressed longitudinally before being clipped at the sample , after which the emittance is on the order of 1 nm .      fig .",
    "[ fig : enx_cgun2 ] shows the corresponding data for the final charge of @xmath54 electrons .",
    "the dynamics is similar to the lower charge , though emittance is significantly larger along the beamline .",
    "the curvature of the final phase in this case indicates the bunch has experienced non - linear fields along transport , which is verified by the increase of the average slice emittance along the beamline .",
    "table-[tab : resparams ] collects all of the relevant emittance data from these simulations , including the estimate of the coherence using eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : lcxemit ] ) .    finally , to put the results of the above examples into perspective",
    ", we compare the emittances in these results to the optimized emittances for longer bunch lengths . fig .",
    "[ fig : enxfinal ] shows the comparison .",
    "as anticipated , the emittance at initial final charges agrees nicely , suggesting the optimizer compensates the requirement of additional bunch compression by clipping out particles ( hence the smaller particle transmission at the sample ) .",
    "these results show that , even when including particle clipping at the sample , the optimized emittances for given final rms transverse and longitudinal beamsizes correctly estimate the coherence length performance .    in this work",
    ", we have presented optimized layouts and element settings found using moga optimizations of space charge simulations of a 225 kv dc gun featuring a cryo - cooled photocathode , separate bunching cavity , and two solenoids .",
    "in addition to computing the optimal emittances in each set - up , realistic optimizations of the coherence length as a function final bunch length at the sample , for three sample radii , and allowing for charge clipping at the sample , produced coherence lengths that may be suitable for single - shot ued experiments with final electron charges of @xmath5 electrons .",
    "these results for the optimized coherence length show a significant difference in the emittance and coherence performance when increasing the charge required at the same from @xmath4 to @xmath5 electrons .",
    "in particular , estimates of the scaling of the coherence length fronts suggest the coherence length scales as @xmath66 for the largest two sample pinhole radii .",
    "in addition to producing coherence data , these simulations also provide optimized beamline element positions .",
    "example solutions from the optimum coherence length fronts demonstrate reasonable beam dynamics for @xmath4 and @xmath5 electrons .",
    "analysis of the optimized coherence lengths shows agreement with the simple formula for the coherence length evaluated at a waist @xmath67 .",
    "estimates of the coherence length using the optimized emittance agree well with the coherence length determined from optimization .",
