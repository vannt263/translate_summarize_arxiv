    "* ) from studies of star formation in metal - free environments",
    ". however , the actual form of the imf for such stars is poorly understood and is still controversial ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "if the imf is not universal then a question arises - how and when did the imf change to the present - day imf which is biased towards low - mass stars ( @xmath2 ) @xcite ?",
    "extremely metal - poor stars ( emp stars ) observed in the galaxy can help to answer this question because we can estimate the number of former agb stars that contributed to the change of the surface abundances evident in these stars .",

    "the large frequency of carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars is argued to be a consequence of binary mass transfer from agb stars that have undergone carbon dredge - up into their envelopes @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for carbon enhancement , the third dredge - up ( tdu ) , is the currently accepted theory that explains the origin of classical ba ii stars and ch stars ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the same manner , the origins of some cemp stars are thought to be explained by the binary scenario , i.e. , the observed stars have binary companions that are now unseen white dwarfs .",
    "one of the advantages of this scenario is that we do not expect all the observed emp stars to show carbon enhancement on their surface .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the recent discovery of emp stars in the lowest metallicity range without large enhancements of carbon @xcite .",

    "the origin of cemp - no stars is still controversial ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , there is another class of emp stars that show enhancements of nitrogen greater than the enhancement of carbon .",
    "these stars are called nitrogen - enhanced metal - poor ( nemp ) stars and are thought to be produced via binary mass transfer from intermediate - mass agb stars which have converted c to n via hot bottom burning ( hbb ) during the agb phase .",
    "previous works exploring the possibility that the imf was different in the early universe @xcite dealt only with the statistics of cemp stars .",

    "the database covers the data published up to 2011 ( august , 2012 update ) .    for wind accretion episodes we assume that the mass accretion onto the secondary star is subject to bondi - hoyle accretion with the constant stellar wind velocity of 20 km / s from the primary star .",

    "the mass boundary for the progenitors of cemp - no stars is also an open question and can change the ratio cemp - no / cemp .",
    "there are four observable constraints on the simulations .",
    "three of them are shown in table  [ tab : model ] , and the other one is the  abundances of emp stars .",
    "firstly , it can be seen that the cemp fraction in our models can never reach as high as the observed 25 per cent when using a low - mass imf ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : cfreq ] ) . in order to check the robustness of the conclusion",
    ", we have tested extreme assumptions for the model parameters , which include ( 1 ) a binary rate of 100 % , ( 2 ) excluding the contribution of supernova binaries because the speed of companion stars could have been higher than the velocity dispersion of the host halo after the disruption of binaries @xcite , and ( 3 ) the carbon abundance of primary star enhanced by a factor of 10 .",
    "the superposition of all these assumptions still fails to explain the observed cemp frequencies at low - metallicity when a low - mass imf is used .",
    "a significant increase in the cemp fraction can only be obtained by assuming that all the emp stars are born as binary systems , although this gives the cemp fraction well below 20 % at @xmath0}}= -2.5 $ ] .",
    "a 100% binary fraction is however highly unlikely @xcite .",
    "secondly , we find that the ratio cemp - no / cemp is extremely low for the models using the low - mass imf . to obtain a ratio cemp - no / cemp @xmath27",
    ", we have to set the lower mass boundary for the formation of cemp - no stars as small as @xmath28",
    ". however , this then leads to a mismatch with the observed ratio cemp-_s _  /emp .",
    "thus it is evident that other sources of cemp - no stars , for example stars that formed out of an ism pre - enriched with carbon , are needed if we adopt a low - mass imf @xcite .",
    "we note however that any source of pre - enrichment would require more massive stars , i.e. , a massive - star dominated imf , although its shape depends on the efficiency of low - mass star formation out of ejecta from the massive stars .",
    "thirdly , the ratios of nemp to cemp stars in models with low - mass imfs are too small to be compatible with the observations .",
    "the observed ratio is around @xmath29 in the current available data @xcite , while it was previously thought to be much smaller @xcite .",
    "the mass range of nemp star progenitors would need to be @xmath30 , without the assumption of mass loss suppression , to obtain a nemp / cemp ratio @xmath260.1 .",
    "this mass range would need a higher efficiency of hbb at low metallicity as has been reported by some studies @xcite .",
    "however , this range will also reduce the cemp fraction dramatically , and hence can not coexist with the requirement for the large frequency of cemp stars .",
    "finally , the number of the progenitors of type i.5 supernovae dominates over , or is comparable to , that of type ii supernovae when a low - mass imf is used , which is not supported observationally since galactic halo stars do not show the low values of  that would be expected from type i.5 supernovae @xcite .",
    "thus our simulations arrive at the robust conclusion that population simulations using low - mass imfs can not match the observational constraints given by galactic emp stars .",
    "our results add to previous evidence for a non - universality of the imf .",
    "other evidence comes from studies such as the population of white dwarfs @xcite , those involving simulations of star formation ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and observations of early - type galaxies ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our study shows that the observed population in the galactic halo can be explained by a transition of the imf from one biased towards high masses to one biased toward lower masses at a metallicity of @xmath0}}\\sim -2 $ ] .",
    "we propose that the statistics of cemp and nemp stars in the entire range of metallicity in our galaxy and dwarf galaxies in the local group should be investigated to reveal the star formation history of galaxies .",
    "we have compared the results of our binary population synthesis model with the observations of metal - poor halo stars in the galaxy .",
    "we find that a low - mass biased imf , similar to the present one , is incompatible with the four observable quantities related to the cemp subclasses . on the other hand , considering a high - mass biased imf , together with the occurrence of sn i.5 in a certain mass and metallicity range ( supported by recent simulations of pulsation - driven mass - loss in low metallicity stars ) , a more reasonable agreement between models and observations",
    "our results imply that the transition of the imf occurred around a metallicity of @xmath0}}\\sim -2 $ ] , which should be tested by star formation theory and observations .",
    "these results also give important clues in the most metal poor regimes as to the mass and metallicity limits of stars that experience hbb , tdu and stellar winds , or that allow the formation of cemp ( -_s _  and -no ) stars , nemp stars , sn i.5 and snii .",
    "our understanding of these limits has been traditionally hampered by the scarcity of observations .",
    "we hope these results can help to improve the understanding of the chemical evolution of our galaxy .",
