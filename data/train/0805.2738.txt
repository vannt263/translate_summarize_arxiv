    "interesting @xmath1 gauge theories can be obtained as low - energy limits of type ii string theories compactified on calabi  yau manifolds with internal boundary conditions on holomorphic submanifolds .",
    "the tree level superpotential of such theories corresponds to the disk amplitudes of the topological b - model , and , in principle , can be computed in various ways , e.g. by using worldsheet techniques , by reducing the holomorphic chern ",
    "simons theory to the brane world - volume , by using an appropriate locally - free resolution , by considering the landau - ginzburg phase of the model , or by various combinations of those methods , see refs .  and the references therein .",
    "the method that we present here exploits the relation between the superpotential , in the large radius limit and when the ambient calabi  yau manifold corresponds to the local space , and the deformation theory of the submanifold , along the lines of ref .  .",
    "it has the advantage of being reasonably pratical for explicit computations and steems from the remark that the deformation theory of a submanifold @xmath2 with given normal bundle @xmath3 is intrinsic to the couple @xmath4 .",
    "we start by reviewing some properties of compact complex submanifolds .",
    "let @xmath2 be a compact complex submanifold of a complex manifold @xmath5 , with normal bundle @xmath3 .",
    "then , for any @xmath6 , there exists a tubular neighborhood @xmath7 of @xmath2 in @xmath5 and an open covering @xmath8 of @xmath2 such that @xmath7 can be covered by an atlas @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , with transition functions @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the transition functions for @xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 those for the normal bundle @xmath3 and its tangent space @xmath15 respectively . if we ignore convergence issues and treat the deformation terms @xmath16 as polynomials in the @xmath17 then@xcite the deformation terms are cocycles representing elements in the ech cohomology group @xmath18 , up to terms of order @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the space @xmath20 parametrizes the tubular neighborhoods that admit a projection to the base @xmath2 .",
    "the tubular neighborhoods of complex submanifolds of calabi  yau manifolds are those with @xmath21 and are parametrized by the kernel of a map induced in cohomology by the _ divergence map _ acting on the sections of the tangent bundle .",
    "now , given a compact submanifold @xmath2 of a complex manifold @xmath5 , there exists@xcite a map , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a neighborhood of @xmath24 , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 and such that @xmath27 parametrizes the local deformations of @xmath2 in @xmath5 .",
    "the map @xmath28 only depends on the local proprierties of the embedding , i.e. only on a tubular neighborhood of @xmath2 in @xmath5 . up to convergence issues , depend on the the convergence properties of the deformation terms . ]",
    "the map @xmath28 can be seen as an element of @xmath29 where in the last line we used serre duality , and @xmath30 .",
    "summarizing , to a given embedding @xmath31 , we can associate an element @xmath32 and a map @xmath28 as in ( [ eq : elementk ] ) , and we would like to determine the relation between the two . in the case",
    "in which there exists a projection to the base , it is very natural to guess that the map associating @xmath33 $ ] to @xmath34 is given by the dual of the multiplication of the sections morphism @xmath35",
    "let now @xmath36 be a curve in a calabi  yau threefold @xmath5 with normal bundle @xmath3 and let us consider a _",
    "simple _ brane wrapped around @xmath36 , i.e. a vector bundle on @xmath37 such that @xmath38 . from a geometric viewpoint ,",
    "the superpotential is a map @xmath39",
    "whose differential @xmath40 gives the map @xmath28 . as we did for the map @xmath28 , we can consider @xmath41 as an element of @xmath42 . by using the calabi ",
    "yau condition , one finds that a tubular neighborhood of @xmath36 in @xmath5 , when a projection to the base does exist , is parametrized by an element in @xmath43 .",
    "then , the expression ( [ proposal1 ] ) implies that the superpotential is given by the map @xmath44 that is dual to the multiplication of the sections map .",
    "the formula ( [ superpotential ] ) seems to be the simplest closed expression for the superpotential in this generality , and reduces to the previously known expressions@xcite for the laufer rational curve .",
    "it is suitable for explicit computations when the multiplication morphism is known , for example in the case of a rational curve @xmath45 or of an elliptic curve @xmath46 . in the case in which the brane is given by a general bundle @xmath47",
    ", the superpotential gives the coupled deformations of the curve @xmath36 and of the vector bundle @xmath47 , and should be obtained by generalizing ( [ superpotential ] ) , although the correct guess is not completely trivial .",
