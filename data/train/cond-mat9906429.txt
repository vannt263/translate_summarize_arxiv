    "the adsorption of proteins and colloids from solution onto solid surfaces often involves strong departure from equilibrium behavior @xcite .",
    "many experimental studies have attempted to quantify the kinetics @xcite of the adsorption process , as well as the structure of the adsorbed configurations @xcite .",
    "protein adsorption has also been the subject of a number of theoretical studies . in particular , the random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) model @xcite is able to account for a number of experimentally observed properties of protein adsorption , such as irreversibility and non - linear surface blockage @xcite .",
    "quantitative expressions are now available for the kinetics of rsa of spherical @xcite and non - spherical particles @xcite on planar interfaces and these models have been shown to provide an excellent description of the adsorption of proteins @xcite , colloids @xcite and other particles .",
    "more recently , the rsa models have been extended to allow for the possibility of post - adsorption conformational change @xcite .",
    "it has been observed experimentally that a fraction of the proteins in an adsorbed layer may be removed by rinsing with a buffer solution or by eluting with a surfactant solution @xcite .",
    "the influence of a desorption step on subsequent adsorption is not well understood .",
    "in particular , one would like to know how the structure of the adsorbed layer is affected by the desorption process and how this influences the kinetics when adsorption resumes .",
    "one anticipates , due to the non - equilibrium nature of the adsorption , that the intermediate desorption step may result in behavior that differs non - trivially from an uninterrupted process .",
    "it is the goal of this work to investigate this by considering a multistep rsa process that begins with the irreversible adsorption of spherical particles onto a planar surface up to a density @xmath0 .",
    "adsorbed particles are then removed randomly until the density falls to @xmath1 .",
    "we then initiate a second irreversible adsorption process beginning from the depleted configuration and investigate how the final saturation density depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the memory effect of the rsa process is expected to result in a final density that is different from that of an uninterrupted rsa process .    in the theoretical part of the study",
    ", we use a distribution function approach to determine the influence of the multistep adsorption process on the structure of the adsorbed particle configuration .",
    "a density expansion of the pair distribution function leads to an approximate description of the structure up to the maximum density in the initial adsorption step .",
    "we then show that if particles desorb randomly from the adsorbed configuration , the radial distribution function is unchanged .",
    "we use this result to estimate the available surface function of the configurations generated by the re - adsorption process and develop approximate interpolant formulas that allow us to estimate the final saturation density . the theory",
    "is then compared with numerical simulations of the process in one and two dimensions .",
    "finally , we use these expressions to determine the extent of desorption needed to optimize the time required to reach a given adsorbed density .",
    "we consider a three - step adsorption / desorption / readsorption process .",
    "the initial phase consists of the irreversible addition of spherical particles of diameter @xmath3 on an initially empty planar interface to a density @xmath4 ( in this work we will use @xmath5 to denote a dimensionless density , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of particles adsorbed in an area @xmath8 ) . during this phase the particles",
    "are placed according to the usual rsa rules i.e. , a trial position is selected from a uniform random distribution .",
    "if the trial particle does not overlap with any previously placed particles it is accepted and remains permanently fixed .",
    "otherwise it is rejected . in the subsequent desorption step ,",
    "particles in the adsorbed configuration are removed at random until the final density is @xmath1 . in the final step ,",
    "the irreversible adsorption process is resumed .",
    "new particles can be added to the depleted configuration until the jamming limit is reached . as a result of the inherent memory of the rsa process , the coverage in this final state , @xmath9 is , in general , different from the usual jamming limit for rsa that occurs without the intermediate desorption step , namely 0.547 @xcite .",
    "the adsorbed configurations are characterized by a set of distribution functions @xmath10 , which represent the density of finding @xmath11 unspecified particles among @xmath7 particles defining the system , at the positions @xmath12 within an area @xmath8 such that @xmath13 .",
    "centered on each pre - adsorbed particle is a circular exclusion region of diameter @xmath3 into which it is impossible to insert the center of an additional particle .",
    "the probability of finding a cavity of diameter @xmath14 centered on @xmath15 that is free from the centers of pre - adsorbed particles is related to the distribution functions via @xmath16 where @xmath17 is shorthand for @xmath18 etc . ,",
    "and @xmath19 is the mayer function .",
    "when the interparticle potential , @xmath20 , is taken for non - overlapping hard spheres of diameter @xmath3 , the mayer function becomes : @xmath21 equation [ phi ] applies to any configuration , equilibrium or not , of spherical particles .",
    "our strategy is to determine the relationship between the configurations before and after the desorption process .",
    "this allows us to find an approximate expression for @xmath22 which we can use to estimate the saturation coverage as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the kinetics during the irreversible adsorption phase are given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the adsorption rate constant .",
    "to solve for the kinetics , one writes down a hierarchy of rate equations for the distribution functions @xcite .",
    "in particular , the pair density evolves according to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the probability density function associated with finding an unspecified particle at @xmath27 and a cavity of diameter @xmath14 free from particle centers at @xmath28 .",

    ", the density evolves according to @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the desorption constant and , if no other relaxation processes ( such as surface diffusion ) are operative during the desorption , the pair density function evolves according to @xmath36 where we indicate explicitly the dependence of the pair density on the density prior to desorption , @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from these two equations that @xmath37 integrating between the initial ( @xmath0 ) and final densities ( @xmath1 ) yields @xmath38 or @xmath39 where @xmath40 defines the radial distribution function .",
    "this physically intuitive result implies that the structure of an arbitrary configuration is not altered by desorption , as long as the particles desorb randomly .",
    "further consequences of this result and its connection with quenched annealed systems are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we now wish to relate the properties of configurations during the re - adsorption step to those of the configurations in the initial adsorption step . up to third order in density ,",
    "the differences between the two configurations come from the term @xmath41 .    integrating ( [ r2r ] ) between @xmath1 and @xmath42 , @xmath43    using ( [ gequiv ] ) to relate the pre- and post - desorption pair distribution functions , we find @xmath44 \\int d3\\;f_{13}f_{23 } + o(\\rho^4)\\bigr]\\ ] ] substituting in ( [ phi ] ) then yields @xmath45\\int d2\\;d3\\;d4\\ ;   f_{12}f_{13}f_{24}f_{34}(1+f_{23 } )",

    "we note that @xmath48 correctly reduces to @xmath49 in both the limit where @xmath50 ( no desorption ) and @xmath51 ( total desorption ) .    during desorption , it is easy to show that @xmath52 we plot that @xmath22 during adsorption , @xmath53 , desorption @xmath54 , and re - adsorption , @xmath48 , in fig .",

    "one has , furthermore , that @xmath58 so @xmath59 @xmath60 and thus the change in @xmath22 may be more pronounced in either desorption or re - adsorption .",
    "it is clear that in either case , the available surface function is enhanced compared with the simple rsa value ( at least to third order in density ) since @xmath61    to obtain quantitative results , we consider the interpolation formula @xmath62(1-x)^3(1+a_1 x + a_2 x^2 ) \\label{interpolant}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 this form is consistent with the asymptotic kinetics , @xmath64 finally , ( [ interpolant ] ) correctly reduces to the equation used to determine @xmath65 for simple rsa when @xmath66 or when @xmath51 . expanding the interpolant in powers of @xmath5 and equating the coefficients with those of ( [ phi ] ) yields an estimate for @xmath67 .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : jlden ] , the saturation coverage is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 and exhibits a maximum versus @xmath1",
    ". actually , the saturation density increases monotonically with the combination @xmath68 , so a maximum occurs for @xmath69 .    in one dimension",
    ", the coefficient @xmath70 takes the value 2/9 .",
    "unfortunately , however , the analogous interpolation formula , @xmath71(1-x)^2(1+a_1 x + a_2 x^2)$ ] does not yield physically acceptable estimates of the jamming density , even in the simple rsa case .",
    "the adsorption - desorption process was simulated using techniques that have been described previously .",
    "disks are deposited randomly and uniformly in a periodic cell of area @xmath8 , subject to the usual rsa constraints of no overlap and no desorption , until the coverage reaches the preset value , @xmath0 . in the desorption step , randomly selected particles are removed until the coverage falls to @xmath1 . the rsa process is then restarted and continued for a total of @xmath72 attempts . in this way we obtain the time - dependent coverage , @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 is the number of attempts that have been made . this function is then averaged over a number , @xmath77 , of independent runs .",
    "the coverage in the jamming limit was estimated by assuming that at long times the kinetics are described by the usual asymptotic kinetics , ( [ asymp ] ) .",
    "the simulation procedure in one - dimension is somewhat different .",
    "rods of unit length are deposited randomly on a line of length @xmath78 subject to the usual constraints of no overlap and no desorption .",
    "when the jamming limit coverage is nearly reached , all the remaining available gaps , each of which can by now accommodate at most one additional rod , are filled by inserting rods randomly and uniformly within them .",
    "partial desorption is then simulated by looping through all the adsorbed particles and removing each with a probability @xmath79 .",
    "this is achieved by generating a uniform random number between zero and one .",
    "if this number is less than @xmath79 the particle is removed .",
    "the depleted configuration then serves as the initial configuration for a new irreversible adsorption process which continues until jamming .",
    "if @xmath7 denotes the number of adsorbed rods , then the coverage is computed from @xmath80 .",
    "since the jamming limit can be reached exactly in the one - dimensional system , the final results are expected to be more accurate than in two dimensions .",
    "in both one and two dimensions , the new jammed state has a higher coverage than that of simple rsa , although the effect is smaller than predicted by the theory . in one dimension ,",
    "figure [ fig : sim1d ] shows that the maximum density ( just over 0.78 ) occurs for @xmath81 or @xmath82 , which is consistent with , although a little larger than , the theoretical prediction of @xmath83 .    in two dimensions ( figure [ fig : sim2d ] ) ,",
    "the enhancement is not statistically significant for @xmath84 . for @xmath85",
    "the effect is clearly evident and the maximum final coverage occurs for @xmath86 while the theoretical estimate is 0.353 .    that the theory overestimates the enhancement is not totally surprising .",
    "the estimate of the saturation coverage provided by the interpolation formula for simple rsa ( 0.553 ) exceeds the actual value ( 0.547 ) .",
    "moreover , the pair density function is taken only to second order in @xmath5 .",
    "an interesting consequence of the findings of this article is that it may be possible to achieve a given surface coverage using an intervening desorption process in a shorter time than with a continuous adsorption process .",
    "we can readily quantify this idea by minimizing the time required to reach a given surface coverage in an adsorption - desorption - adsorption process by optimizing densities at which the desorption step begins , @xmath0 , and ends , @xmath87 .",
    "let @xmath88 denote the time at which the adsorbed density is @xmath89 . in a process with a single desorption step @xmath90^{-1}d\\rho + \\int_{\\rho_1}^{\\rho_{2 } } [ k_d\\rho]^{-1}d\\rho +   \\int_{\\rho_{2}}^{\\rho_f}[\\phi(\\rho_1,\\rho_{2},\\rho)]^{-1}d\\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we find the minimum time to reach the density @xmath89 by by optimizing the density at the beginning of the desorption step and that after desorption . as we will demonstrate , the amount adsorbed in such a process can exceed that in a continuous adsorption process without interruption .",
    "the required densities are found from a numerical solution of the equations @xmath91 this is achieved by iterating the following matrix equation :    @xmath92^{\\rm new}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\rho_1\\\\ \\rho_{2 } \\end{array } \\right]-\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\frac{\\partial^2 t_f}{\\partial\\rho_1 ^ 2 } &   \\frac{\\partial^2 t_f}{\\partial \\rho_1\\partial\\rho_{2 } } \\\\",

    "[ fig : twostep ] shows @xmath0 and @xmath1 which minimize the time required to produce an adsorbed configuration with a final density of @xmath89 . for a given value of @xmath35 ,",
    "the two curves converge at @xmath97 .",
    "if the desired final density is larger than this value , it will be more efficient i.e. , require less time , with a two - step process than with a single step process .",
    "if the final density is less than @xmath97 , the single step process is more efficient . as @xmath35 increases , @xmath97 decreases since the time required to remove a given fraction of particles",
    "is a decreasing function of @xmath35 .",
    "thus at large desorption rates less time is spent in the desorption phase .",
    "we observe that @xmath0 appears to be almost independent of @xmath35 ( for @xmath98 ) , while @xmath1 curves converge at large values of @xmath35 .",
    "the two - step process is most efficient in the limit @xmath99 . that the two step process can be more efficient than a one - step process is a result of the inherent memory of the adsorbed configurations . without this memory effect ,",
    "the two - step process is always less efficient .",
    "we have developed a theoretical approach for modeling a three - step surface filling process composed of two irreversible adsorption steps separated by a desorption step .",
    "this approach considers the effects of surface density and coverage history on the adsorbate particle distribution functions and predicts an enhancement of the saturation surface density that is maximized when one third of the molecules are removed during the intermediate desorption step .",
    "one experimental realization of this process is partially reversible macromolecular adsorption where only a certain fraction of molecules desorb during a buffer rinse .",
    "partial reversibility may be due to adsorbent heterogeneity , formation of stable clusters of molecules on the surface , or post - adsorption transitions in conformation or orientation .",
    "another experimental realization of this proces is the elution of otherwise irreversibly adsorbed macromolecules with surfactant or detergent eluting agents @xcite .",
    "the results presented here could have important implications for these and other multi - step filling processes when a high saturation density and/or a rapid surface filling is required .",
