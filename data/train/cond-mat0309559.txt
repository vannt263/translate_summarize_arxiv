    "the past decade has seen a revolution in biophysics , due to exquisitely sensitive experiments @xcite which probe ingredients of the `` central dogma '' of molecular biology @xcite at the level of _ individual _ molecules . although exceptions exist , the central dogma states that biological information first flows from dna to messenger rna via transcription mediated by a rna polymerase .",
    "information is then transferred from mrna to proteins via a ribosome - mediated translation process .    among the efforts to probe the basic constituents further : ( a )",
    "proteins anchored to a microscope slide in their biologically relevant folded state have been teased apart with atomic force probes @xcite attached using , e.g. , biotin - streptavidin linkages ; ( b )  individual dna s linked to magnetic beads have been stretched and twisted by small magnetic field gradients , allowing studies of both supercoiling and twist - induced denaturation @xcite ; and ( c )  the reversible unfolding of single rna molecules ( with beads attached to both ends ) has been studied using laser tweezers with a feedback loop to generate a constant force @xmath2 @xcite . in this later experiment , the fluctuating displacements of a @xmath025 base - pair rna hairpin evolve from a predominantly closed state ( with rare opening events ) at small force to a predominantly open state ( with rare closing events ) at larger forces . at an intermediate force of @xmath3 piconewtons @xmath4 ,",
    "the hairpin spends approximately equal time in both configurations , suggestive of a first - order phase transition between the open and closed states in the `` thermodynamic limit '' of a very large hairpin .",

    ", the 48,502 base pairs of the virus phage lambda with one strand attached to a microscope slide were unzipped by a microneedle attached to the other strand under conditions which produced a constant rate of unzipping at a fixed temperature .",
    "reasonable agreement with these experiments was obtained by direct numerical evaluation of the equilibrium statistical sums associated with a given average degree of unzipping .",
    "if the rate of unzipping is slow , such experiments effectively probe the physics at constant extension .",
    "the average force under these conditions locks in at about 1415 piconewtons .",
    "the time - dependent fluctuations of this force as the unzipping proceeds provide information about the particular sequence of g : c and a : t base pairs being torn apart @xcite .",
    "the full phase diagram of dna in the force - temperature plane is shown in fig .",
    "the thermal dna melting transition at zero force ( see sec .",
    "2 ) is characterized by diverging length scales associated with denaturation bubbles . when @xmath5 , the native duplex dna denatures into an unzipped state via a first - order phase transition ( see sec .",
    "3 ) . under conditions of a slow , constant rate of extension",
    "@xcite , the average force _ adjusts _ so that the system sits on the heavy first - order transition line @xmath6 . at any stage in the unzipping process",
    ", the unzipping fork separating the native and unzipped states is like the meniscus dividing , say , liquid and gas phases at constant volume at a bulk first - order phase transition .",
    "although running unzipping experiments in a two - phase region associated with the line @xmath6 is well - suited for possible dna sequencing applications @xcite , the full force - temperature phase diagram of fig . 2 is interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "first , understanding dna denaturation under conditions of constant force ( instead of constant extension ) could provide insights into the complicated process by which dna replicates during bacterial cell division @xcite .",
    "second , statistical mechanics in ensembles with _ intensive _ variables like the force held fixed is often more tractable than when the control parameter is a conjugate variable like the extension .",
    "precise analytic predications are indeed possible in the vicinity of @xmath7 , even when sequence disorder is present @xcite .",
    "third , experiments which use force as a control parameter can probe interesting behavior of the unzipping fork for @xmath8 ( analogous to `` wetting '' phenomena in bulk phase transitions @xcite ) and anomalous fork dynamics for @xmath9 .",
    "because of significantly different bonding strengths of the nucleotide pairs a : t ( two hydrogen bonds ) and g : c ( three hydrogen bonds ) , heterogeneity dominates unzipping over a large region of the phase diagram , for @xmath10 , inside the region bounded by the dashed lines in fig .  2 .",
    "in this section we discuss the thermal denaturation of dna at zero force ( vertical arrow in fig .",
    "2 ) . this transition plays an important role in the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , where it is applied cyclically to amplify minute amounts of dna .",
    "the basic physical ideas driving thermal denaturation ( worked out in the 1960s ) are described in refs .",
    "the simplest models invoke the ising - like description of dna shown in fig .",
    "3a , where right - facing spins represent bonded nucleotides in a closed `` helix '' state and left - facing spins the open `` coil '' state .",
    "the magnetic field of the equivalent ising model represents a ( temperature - dependent ) nucleotide bonding free energy and the ising exchange energy determines an `` initiation factor '' at the boundaries between the helix and coil regions .",
    "the statistical mechanics of this one - dimensional ising model can be described entirely in terms of kink excitations associated with transitions between domains of up and down spins , which here represent helix / coil boundaries .",
    "rapid variations in dna from a helix - dominated to a coil - dominated state are predicted by such models @xcite , corresponding to the magnetic field changing sign in the equivalent ising system .",
    "however , it is well - known that the 1d ising model does not have a real phase transition at finite temperature , basically because the finite energy cost of kinks at zero external field is overwhelmed by the entropy gained by creating them [ 20 ] .",
    "an improved theory results when the three - dimensional entropy of wandering loops in the coil sections ( see fig .",
    "3b ) is taken into account .",
    "this can be done by approximating the loops as ideal random walks @xcite , or improving this estimate by taking self - avoidance of the loops into account @xcite .",
    "the effect on the statistical mechanics is to produce a long range interaction which binds kinks together and leads to a continuous finite temperature phase transition @xcite .",
    "recent work by kafri _",
    "et al . _ incorporates additional self - avoidance between coil sections and the rest of the dna chain ( important for large molecules ) and argues that the thermal denaturation transition then becomes first order @xcite .",
    "heterogeneity of the bonding between base pairs ( g : c bonds are stronger than a : t ones ) is neglected in the treatments above .",
    "simple helix - coil descriptions with heterogeneity are governed by the statistical mechanics of the 1d random field ising model . a reasonable guess for more realistic models with heterogeneity",
    "is that while the transition may be less sharp ( weakly bound regions melt before more tightly bound ones ) , a real finite temperature phase transition survives .",

    "each dna to be unzipped is offset by an additional dna spacer ( see fig .",
    "biotin links the other end of the dna to magnetic beads .",
    "unzipping at constant force is achieved by applying a uniform magnetic field gradient , causing the beads to stretch out at right angles to the capillary tube , like a series of flags on a flagpole .",
    "figure 12a records some unzipping histories at @xmath207c for three different beads at different heights on this `` flagpole '' with @xmath208  @xmath1 , corresponding approximately to the critical unzipping force for the front half of the sequence for phage lambda .",

    "the beads are well separated , and are clearly subject to microscopically different thermal histories .",
    "nevertheless , there are distinctive pauses ( some lasting 15 minutes or more ) and jumps common to the different beads . as the individual dna s unzip , the beads occasionally jump back and forth , suggesting two nearly degenerate minima in the energy landscape about 1000 base pairs apart .",
    "this behavior is similar to that found for much shorter rna hairpains in ref .",
    "the long pauses before unzipping resumes are consistent with large energy barriers , of order 2030  @xmath149 .",
    "in contrast , unzipping at a slow constant velocity is an _ imperative _ in the work of bockelmann _ et al .",
    "because these experiments are _ effectively _ at constant extension , the force in this case fluctuates as needed about @xmath6 to insure that all energy barriers are overcome .",
    "many of the pauses and local `` two - level system '' oscillations found by the prentiss group coincide with those predicted for phage lambda dna @xcite , using energy landscapes obtained from the base pairing and stacking energies of santa lucia _ et al .",
    "overall , these experiments seem consistent with important aspects of the theory reviewed here , such as large energy barriers and sequence - specific pause points .",

    "there are again jumps between common plateaus as well as oscillations suggesting nearly degenerate minima .",
    "although 20 @xmath1 should be above the thermodynamic critical force @xmath6 , the dna nevertheless fails to unzip completely on experimental time scales , presumably due to the ruggedness of `` downhill '' landscapes such as that in fig . 10 .",

    "analysis of this free energy is simplified if a theory of the unzipped handles is available .",

    "the assumption ( 36 ) of short - range correlations in the sequence is an approximation valid only for simple `` coding dna '' in bacteria or viruses .",

    "although we are unaware of detailed calculations , a straightforward generalization of the argument leading to eq . ( 42 ) now gives @xcite @xmath213 for @xmath214 , we expect that predictions for sequences with short - range correlations will apply .",
    "the exponent @xmath215 seems to describe the energy correlations of some intron - rich sequences [ 36 ] .",
    "ideas similar to those discussed here can also be applied to force - induced denaturation @xcite of the multiple stem - loop structures which define the secondary structure of complicated rna enzymes . here , however , strings of rna hairpins are unzipped simultaneously and the discrete jumps and plateaus in @xmath175 near the unzipping force are averaged out .",
