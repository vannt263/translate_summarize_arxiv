    "the present article is based on the background previous papers and monographs [ 1 - 16 ] as well on the recent contribution [ 17 - 26 ] .    in ref.[17 ] the hamiltonian of the electron - radiation interaction in the second quantization representation for the case of 2d coplanar electron - hole ( e - h ) systems in a strong perpendicular magnetic field was derived .",
    "the s - type conduction band electrons with spin projections @xmath10 along the magnetic field direction and the heavy holes with total momentum projections @xmath11 in the p - type valence band were taken into account .",
    "the periodic parts of their bloch wave functions are similar to @xmath12 expressions with the orbital momentum projection @xmath13 on the same selected direction .",
    "the envelope parts of the bloch wave functions have the forms of plane waves in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "in its presence they are completely changed due to the landau quantization event . in the papers [ 17 - 26 ] the landau quantization of the 2d electrons and holes",
    "is described in the landau gauge and is characterized by the oscillator - type motion in one in - plane direction giving rise to discrete landau levels enumerated by the quantum numbers @xmath14 and @xmath15 and by the free translation motion in another in - plane direction perpendicular to previous one .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) plane waves describing this motion are marked by the 1d wave numbers p and q. in ref.[18 ] the landau quantization of the 2d electrons with non - parabolic dispersion law , pseudospin components and chirality terms was investigated . on this base in ref.[19 ] the influence of the rashba spin - orbit coupling ( rsoc ) on the 2d magnetoexcitons was discussed .",
    "the spinor - type wave functions of the conduction and valence electrons in the presence of the rsoc have different numbers of landau quantization levels for different spin projections .",
    "as was demonstrated in refs[18 , 19 , 22 ] , the difference between these numbers is determined by the order of the chirality terms .",
    "their origin is due to the influence of the external electric field applied to the layer parallel to the direction of the magnetic field . in ref.[19 ] two lowest landau levels ( llls ) of the conduction electron and four llls for the holes were used to calculate the matrix elements of the coulomb interaction between the charged carriers as well as the matrix elements of the electron - radiation interaction . on these bases",
    "the ionization potentials of the new - magnetoexcitons and the probabilities of the quantum transitions from the ground state of the crystal to the magnetoexciton states were calculated . in the present description",
    "the number of the hole and magnetoexciton states will be enlarged and the formation of magnetopolaritons taking into account the rsoc will be described .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section 2 the results concerning the landau quantization of the 2d heavy holes as well as of the electrons in the conduction band taking into account the rashba spin - orbit interaction",
    "were remembered . on this base",
    "the hamiltonians describing the electron - radiation interaction and of the coulomb electron - electron interaction in the presence of the rashba spin - orbit coupling were deduced in the section 3 and 4 correspondingly .",
    "the section 5 is devoted to the description of the magnetoexcitons in the model of a bose gas . in the section 6 the breaking of the gauge symmetry of the obtained hamiltonians",
    "is introduced and the mixed photon - magnetoexciton - acoustical plasmon states are discussed .",
    "the section 7 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "first of all we will describe the landau quantization of the 2d heavy holes following the ref.[19 , 22 ] .",
    "the full landau - rashba hamiltonian for 2d heavy holes was discussed in ref.[19 ] following the formulas ( 13)-(20 ) .",

    "all the lower branches in their initial parts have a linear increasing behavior up till they achieve the maximal values succeeded by the minimal values in the middle parts of their evolutions being transformed in the final quadratic increasing dependences .",
    "the values of the magnetic field strength corresponding to the minima and to the maxima decrease with the increasing of the number @xmath24 . these peculiarities can be compared with the case of landau quantization of the 2d electron in the biased bilayer graphene described in ref.[18 ] .",
    "the last case is characterized by the initial dispersion law without parabolic part and by second order chirality terms .",
    "they both lead to dependences on the magnetic field strength for the lower dispersion branches with sharp initial decreasing parts and minimal values succeeded by the quadratic increasing behavior .",
    "the differences between the initial dispersion laws and chirality terms in two cases of bilayer graphene and of heavy holes lead to different intersections and degeneracies of the landau levels .",
