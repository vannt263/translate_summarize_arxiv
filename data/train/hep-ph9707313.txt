    "non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite is a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of systems with two or more heavy quarks at momentum transfers much less than their mass .",
    "such systems are more complicated than single - heavy quark systems described by the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite because the quarks scatter via the qcd potential .",
    "this introduces infrared divergences in heavy quark scattering near threshold in hqet which must be regulated by resumming an infinite number of insertions of the kinetic energy operator .",
    "since this operator is subleading in @xmath3 , this violates hqet power counting .",
    "this kinematic regime of qcd is of interest for a number of physical systems , including quarkonium , @xmath4 near threshold and nonrelativistic qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "similar techniques are also of interest for other nonrelativistic systems , such as positronium @xcite and low - energy nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "a concrete example where hqet power counting fails is provided by an external current in qcd coupled to @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is some dirac matrix . in processes with a single incoming and outgoing heavy quark ( such as semileptonic @xmath7 decay ) there is no potential scattering and hqet is the appropriate low - energy theory .",
    "loop graphs such as fig .",
    "[ hqetloop](a ) are well - defined in hqet , and the matching conditions for this current in hqet are currently known to @xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the one - loop correction to quark - antiquark production by the same current near threshold can not be correctly described in hqet ; the one - loop graph in fig .  [ hqetloop](b ) is infinite when the four - velocities of the quarks are the same , and gives rise to the well - known infinite complex anomalous dimension for the current @xcite .",
    "= 8 cm    the appropriate low - energy theory for the second process is nrqcd , which treats potential scattering near threshold properly .",
    "in this paper we consider the general problem of matching an external fermion - antifermion production current in a nonrelativistic theory .",
    "we pay particular attention to power counting in the nrqcd expansion parameter @xmath0 , the relative three - velocity of the heavy quarks .",
    "power counting in nrqcd is less transparent than in hqet , for several reasons .",
    "first , since @xmath0 is not a parameter in the lagrangian , power counting is not manifest in the nrqcd lagrangian , although there are simple rules for determining the @xmath0 scaling of an operator @xcite .",
    "second , the power counting for on - shell gluons differs from that of virtual gluons contributing to potential scattering @xcite and in order to have simple @xmath0 counting this distinction must be implemented at the level of the lagrangian .",
    "also , in order to retain simple @xmath0 counting beyond tree level the theory must be regulated with a mass - independent regulator such as dimensional regularization , instead of the usual momentum cutoff ( otherwise divergent loop integrals change the power counting of feynman graphs in the effective theory ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ vpc ]",
    "we discuss velocity power counting in nrqcd , and the relation between the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . in order to maintain manifest @xmath0 power counting in dimensionally regulated nrqcd",
    "we introduce two sets of gluon fields , corresponding to propagating gluons and an instantaneous potential . in section [ nrym ]",
    "we discuss the matching of an external current in nonrelativistic yukawa theory ( nry ) , and show that the dependence on the infrared regulator vanishes in the matching when both gluon fields are included in the low - energy theory .",
    "we consider this theory both because it is simpler than qcd , as well as to stress that manifest velocity power counting does not depend on working in any particular gauge , such as coulomb gauge . in section [ nrqcdm ]",
    "we match an external current in nrqcd to @xmath9 , and explicitly show that the low - energy theory reproduces the nonanalytic behaviour of qcd to this order .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in nrqcd , the power counting of terms in the lagrangian is different from hqet , allowing potential scattering near threshold to be correctly described .",
    "operators are classified according to how they scale with the three - velocity @xmath0 instead of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "since the kinetic energy of a nonrelativistic state is proportional to @xmath10 while the momentum is proportional to @xmath0 , space and time derivatives scale differently with @xmath0 , and power counting is not manifest in the nrqcd lagrangian , @xmath11 nonrelativistic fields are distinguished here from fields in the full theory by the subscript @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the gauge fixing term , @xmath14 is the gauge - covariant derivative ( @xmath15 ) and the dots denote higher dimension operators whose matrix elements are suppressed by powers of @xmath0 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a rescaling of the fields and coordinates was introduced to make the @xmath0 counting of operators manifest at the level of the lagrangian .",

    "the @xmath0 scaling of operators is manifest in the lagrangian . in lorentz gauge ,",
    "@xmath25    of course , there is no physics in a simple rescaling .",
    "however , in order to have an effective theory in which the @xmath0 power counting is manifest , the additional prescription that terms which are subleading in @xmath0 be treated as operator insertions must be added ( otherwise , loop graphs evaluated in dimensional regularization will mix powers of @xmath0 ) . as was noted in @xcite , once this prescription is added , the rescaling in eq .",
    "( [ rescaled1 ] ) misses important physics .",
    "while it provides the correct description of virtual gluon exchange corresponding to an instantaneous potential , it fails to correctly describe on - shell gluons .",
    "the problem is that the pole in the full gluon propagator occurs at @xmath26 , or , in terms of rescaled variables , @xmath27 .",
    "unless the time derivative in the gluon kinetic term is treated exactly instead of as an insertion ( which would violate manifest @xmath0 counting ) , amplitudes in the effective theory do not have the correct branch cut corresponding to physical gluon propagation , so the effective theory can not describe on - shell gluons .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that this problem is avoided by a further rescaling ( in coulomb gauge ) of the space coordinates of only the transverse components of the gauge fields . in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite instead of @xmath0 ; however , the two descriptions are equivalent .",

    "once the multipole expansion is performed , loop integrals in dimensional regularization do not change the @xmath0 scaling of a graph determined by the vertices .",
    "there is , however , a subtlety arising from the multipole expansion . since three - momentum is not conserved at the vertices , transverse gluons can not alter the three - momenta of the heavy quarks .",
    "potential scattering via transverse gluon exchange therefore does not occur in the low energy theory .",
    "since the amplitude for potential scattering is not analytic in the external momenta , it can not be reproduced in nrqcd by the addition of local operators . both potential scattering and real gluon emission",
    "are long - distance effects , so in order to correctly describe the infrared physics of qcd in the nonrelativistic limit the instantaneous potential due to transverse gluon exchange must be added to the effective theory .",
    "this may either be done by explicitly including spatially non - local operators in the nonrelativistic theory ( the need for which was discussed in @xcite ) , or by reintroducing a second gluon field which couples according to eq .",
    "( [ rescaled1 ] ) .",
    "the need for two distinct gluon fields is understood by comparing the energy and momentum of radiated gluons compared to those involved in potential scattering . in the nonrelativistic regime of qcd",
    "there are nonanalytic contributions to scattering amplitudes arising from gluons in two separate kinematic regions , both with energy of order @xmath37 .",
    "the gluons with spatial momenta @xmath38 are far off shell and contribute to potential scattering .",
    "in contrast , the gluons with spatial momenta @xmath39 may be on - shell , describing real radiation , but do not contribute to the scattering of quarks with three - momenta of order @xmath40 ( in the limit @xmath30 ) .",
    "each of the rescalings discussed above treats one of these kinematic regimes correctly , while missing the physics of the other . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not possible to describe both regimes via any single rescaling . in order to correctly describe the infrared physics of qcd in the nonrelativistic limit two separate gluon fields must be included , which will be referred to in this work as  potential \" and  radiation \" gluons , corresponding to the two different kinematic regimes described above .    in this approach",
    "the heavy quark lagrangian in nrqcd in lorentz gauge is therefore , in standard ( unrescaled ) units , @xmath41 where the subscripts @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote potential and radiation gluons , @xmath44 is the field strength tensor for radiation gluons , and @xmath45 is the gauge parameter . for practical calculations ,",
    "this version of the lagrangian is much more convenient than the rescaled version .",
    "the rescaled theory simply guarantees that loop graphs computed in the unrescaled theory , with the appropriate terms treated as operator insertions , will have @xmath0 scaling determined by the vertices .",
    "coulomb gauge is usually used in nrqcd because in this gauge @xmath46 exchange corresponds to an instantaneous potential .",
    "once @xmath0 counting is performed as in the previous section , potential gluon exchange is instantaneous in all gauges for both transverse and longitudinal gluons .",
    "more generally , potential scattering proceeds via an instantaneous interaction even in theories with no gauge freedom . to illustrate this in a theory which is simpler than qcd ,",
    "in this section we consider a nonrelativistic yukawa theory ( nry ) of a massive fermi field @xmath47 coupled to a massless scalar @xmath48 .    as a warmup for our calculation of the matching conditions for @xmath1 in qcd , we consider here the matching conditions for an external current coupling to @xmath49 in nry . in processes with a single incoming and outgoing fermion",

    ", graphs containing a single insertion of the tree - level matching of @xmath174 , the two - loop matching of @xmath174 and the tree - level matching of @xmath194 combined with a single higher order potential contribution are equally important . in this region ,",
    "the one - loop matching to @xmath174 and @xmath195 that are presented here are the same order as the three loop matching to @xmath194 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a power counting scheme for nonrelativistic effective theories that allows for a systematic calculation of subleading effects .",
    "a systematic @xmath0 counting scheme simplifies the calculation of relativistic corrections to qcd processes such as quarkonium production and decay .",
    "as it is usually presented , nrqcd does not have manifest @xmath0 power counting in the lagrangian , nor is @xmath0 power counting preserved by loop graphs either in dimensional regularization or with a momentum cutoff . while there is nothing in principle wrong with this , it makes calculating matching conditions somewhat awkward , since the matching conditions for any given operator will change by @xmath196 when higher order operators are included in the lagrangian .",
    "velocity power counting is only preserved by loop graphs in dimensionally regulated nrqcd when gluons contributing to potential scattering are treated separately from on - shell gluons .",
    "this was accomplished in this paper by introducing two distinct gluon fields in the effective theory .",
    "potential gluons propagate instantaneously and give rise to the qcd potential , whereas radiation gluons do not contribute to potential scattering , but correspond to on - shell gluons .",
    "the power counting is manifest in the lagrangian when space , time and the fields are rescaled for the potential fields as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and for radiation fields as discussed in ref .  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , under this rescaling radiation fields couple to fermions via the multipole expansion . separating these gluon modes realizes at the level of the lagrangian the separation advocated for nrqed in ref.@xcite . under this rescaling @xmath0",
    "power counting is manifest in any gauge , not just coulomb gauge , and also holds for non - gauge interactions .",
    "the infrared divergences arising in fermion - antifermion production in yukawa theory at order @xmath173 and @xmath197 were shown to be reproduced in the nonrelativistic effective theory only when both potential and radiation scalars were included , and the matching conditions at that order were shown to be analytic in the external momentum .",
    "finally , the matching conditions for quark - antiquark production by an external vector current were computed in nrqcd to @xmath9 .",
