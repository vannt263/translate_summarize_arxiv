    "identifying the mechanism which breaks electroweak symmetry and generates fermion masses is one of the main physics goals for both the lhc and the ilc .",
    "studies of the top quark have the potential to illuminate this issue ; since it is the heaviest of the standard model ( sm ) fermions , the top is expected to couple strongly to the symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "consequently , the structure of that sector can have significant , potentially observable effects on the properties of the top .",
    "for example , it is well known that the vector and axial @xmath1 form factors receive large corrections ( of order 5 - 10% ) in certain models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite . at future colliders such as the lhc and the ilc",
    ", we will be able to pursue a program of precision top physics , similar to the program studying the @xmath2 at lep and slc . in this manuscript",
    ", we study the corrections to the top quark properties in `` little higgs '' models of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite , and compare the expected deviations from the sm predictions with expected sensitivities of experiments at the lhc and the ilc .    in the little higgs models ,",
    "electroweak symmetry is driven by the radiative effects from the top sector , including the sm - like top and its heavy counterpart , a tev - scale `` heavy top '' @xmath3 . probing this structure experimentally is quite difficult .",
    "while the lhc should be able to discover the @xmath3 quark , its potential for studying its couplings is limited  @xcite .",
    "direct production of the @xmath3 will likely be beyond the kinematic reach of the ilc .",
    "however , we will show below that the corrections to the gauge couplings of the sm top , induced by its mixing with the @xmath3 , will be observable at the ilc throughout the parameter range consistent with naturalness . measuring these corrections",
    "will provide a unique window on the top sector of the little higgs .",
    "little higgs models contain a light higgs boson which is a _",
    "composite _ of more fundamental degrees of freedom .",
    "a generic composite higgs model must become strongly coupled at an energy scale around 1 tev , leading to unacceptably large corrections to precision electroweak observables .",
    "in contrast , little higgs models remain perturbative until a higher energy scale , around 10 tev .",
    "the hierarchy between the higgs mass and the strong coupling scale is natural and stable with respect to radiative corrections . because of the special symmetry structure of the theory ,",
    "the higgs mass vanishes at tree level , as do one - loop quadratically divergent diagrams .",
    "the mass term is dominated by the logarithmically divergent one - loop contribution from the top quark , which triggers electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "many little higgs models have been proposed in the literature .",
    "we will consider two examples in this study , the `` littlest higgs '' model  @xcite , and its variation incorporating t parity  @xcite .",
    "as our first example , consider the @xmath4 littlest higgs ( lh ) model  @xcite . since the original model turned out to be severely constrained by precision electroweak data  @xcite , we focus on the version with a reduced gauge group , @xmath5 , which is significantly less constrained .",
    "we follow the conventions and notation of ref .",
    "the new tev - scale states are the gauge bosons @xmath6 , a vector - like weak - singlet quark @xmath3 ( the `` heavy top '' ) , and a weak - triplet scalar field @xmath7 . the model is parametrized by the symmetry breaking scale @xmath8 ( assumed to be of order 1 tev ) , the @xmath9 mixing angle @xmath10 , the @xmath11 coupling constant @xmath12 , and the triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath13 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 gev is the sm higgs vev . in this analysis",
    ", we will set @xmath16 , since the effects of a non - vanishing @xmath17 on the observables considered here are numerically small . instead of @xmath8",
    ", we will use the more physical quantity , the heavy top mass @xmath18 , in our plots ; these are related by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the sm top yukawa .",
    "naturalness arguments put an upper bound on this parameter , @xmath21 tev .",
    "corrections to the gauge couplings of the top quark in the lh model arise from two sources : the mixing of the ( left - handed ) top with the heavy top @xmath3 , and the mixing of the sm gauge bosons @xmath22 with their heavy counterparts , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . using the superscripts `` t '' and `` g '' to denote the contributions from these two sources , the corrections to the @xmath1 coupling can be written as g^zt_r = 0 ,  & &   g^zg_r = g_r^z , + g^zt_l = ,  & &   g^zg_l = . here , @xmath25 are the sm left- and right - handed @xmath1 couplings , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are their vector and axial combinations , @xmath28 are respectively the cosine and sine of the weak mixing angle , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the predicted shifts in the @xmath1 axial and vector couplings for @xmath31 and 2.0 tev , and @xmath32 , are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lh ] ( left panel ) , along with the experimental sensitivities expected at the lhc  @xcite and the ilc  @xcite .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath10 is varied between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "note that the shifts have a definite sign .",
    "while only a rather small part of the parameter space is accessible at the lhc even with 3000 fb@xmath35 integrated luminosity , the ilc experiments will be able to easily observe the shifts in most of the parameter space preferred by naturalness considerations .",
    "the corrections to the @xmath36 coupling have the form g^wt_r = 0 ,  & &   g^wg_r = 0 , + g_l^wt = - ,  & &  g_l^w g = g^w s_^2 ( c_^2- s_^2 - ) , where @xmath37 is the sm @xmath36 coupling .",
    "these corrections induce a shift in the top width , @xmath38 . the induced shift , as a function of the angle @xmath10 ,",
    "is plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lh ] , where the parameter @xmath12 is varied between 0.5 and 2 for @xmath39 and 2.0 tev .",
    "the accuracy of the top width measurement expected at the ilc  @xcite will allow to observe this effect in most of the natural parameter space .",
    "the shift in the @xmath40 coupling has the form = - , where the reference value is @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is inferred from the experimentally measured values for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the lh model can be extended to include a discrete symmetry , t parity  @xcite , which greatly reduces the contributions to precision electroweak observables  @xcite . the main new feature in this model",
    "is the absence of the gauge boson mixing , since light and heavy gauge bosons have opposite charges under t parity .",
    "the top - heavy top mixing is still present , however .",
    "the resulting corrections to the @xmath1 and @xmath36 vertices are identical to the corresponding shifts in the model without t parity , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , given in eqs .   and  .",
    "the shift in the axial @xmath1 coupling is plotted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tpar ] .",
    "( the shift in the vector coupling is identical up to a sign . )",
    "the correction to the top width is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tpar ] .",
    "again , both effects should be observable at the ilc .",
