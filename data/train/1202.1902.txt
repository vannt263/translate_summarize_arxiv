    "the seminal paper by @xcite laid the groundwork for our present understanding of the broad multi - wavelength properties of m dwarf flares .",
    "the basic two - component flare spectral model ( h recombination + warm blackbody continuum ) presented in @xcite is useful for estimating the total energy and stellar surface extent of flares in the optical regime @xcite .",
    "however , this model does not specifically address the detailed spectral features observed during flares , such as line emission from h , he i , he ii , and ca ii h&k , nor the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) as the flare cools and decays .",
    "a partnership of multi - wavelength photometric and spectroscopic time - domain observing campaigns ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and detailed radiative hydrodynamical modeling @xcite are required to extend our understanding of stellar flare emission physics .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of m dwarfs that show evidence of magnetic activity as defined by h@xmath9 emission decreases with height above the galactic plane .",
    "this is thought to be an age effect , with the older , less active stars lying further from the plane due to dynamical heating and radial migration within the disk @xcite .",
    "flares may play an important role in the main sequence stellar evolution for low - mass stars , and correlating m dwarf flare rates with mass and metallicity promises to yield an effective constraint on the ages of stellar populations .",
    "models and observations of the initial mass function indicate that m dwarfs are the primary stellar component in the galaxy by number @xcite .",
    "recent large scale surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss ) , have photometrically identified millions of m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these stars make excellent tracers of nearby galactic structure due to their high number densities @xcite , and future survey missions , like the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will detect m dwarfs to nearly the full extent of the galaxy , using longer wavelength bandpasses and deep repeat imaging .",
    "lsst will map the sky approximately 1000 times over 10 years using @xmath10 bands , and is expected to detect flares both as variability in previously quiescent stars , and as transient emission from previously undetected sources .",

    "they confirmed the increase of the flare duty cycle with later spectral type , and further investigated the galactic height dependence of flaring activity , finding that the stars that flared were even more closely confined to the galactic plane than the stars with h@xmath9 activity .",
    "the few studies of m dwarf flares in the near infrared ( nir ) that have been previously attempted have not found a consistent relationship to the optical emission .",
    "@xcite , for example , measured a marginal anti - correlation between optical u - band and infrared k - band photometry of two flares .",

    "observations of flares on the sun in the nir offer a more promising avenue .",
    "@xcite studied the luminosity of solar flares at 1.6@xmath12 m , the h@xmath13 opacity minimum , and found a correlation with hard x - ray and white - light optical emission for two x - class flares .",
    "their data indicated that the nir band reached peak luminosity after the x - ray , and was responding to secondary heating , possibly from chromospheric back - warming .",
    "modern m dwarf flare studies are expanding both in wavelength and temporal coverage to gain insight into stellar flare physics , as well as the contaminating impact these events have on detecting other sources of variability .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between flare energies in the optical , near - uv , and x - ray . @xcite",
    "have observed flaring m dwarfs with nir spectroscopy to characterize the correlation between nir emission lines , such as the h paschen series , and blue optical broadband flux during flares .",
    "dedicated high time - cadence white - light flare studies from the kepler mission @xcite will allow an order - of - magnitude improvement in the study of flare frequency distributions @xcite and their possible evolution .",

    "discerning true variability from background noise requires sophisticated statistical techniques . following k09 ,",

    "excesses of positive @xmath42 values represent correlated variability , from events such as flares or eclipses .",
    "we computed the @xmath42 statistic for all pairs of bandpasses `` adjacent '' in wavelength space ( e.g. @xmath50 , @xmath51 for every epoch in our samples .",
    "since the sdss and 2mass data were not obtained contemporaneously ( see figure [ lc ] ) we do not compute @xmath52 .",
    "figure [ phi ] shows the @xmath42 histograms for all objects in our stripe 82 and cal - pswdb samples .",
    "the black line indicates the @xmath53 data , hereafter denoted @xmath54 , while the blue line shows the @xmath55 data , hereafter @xmath56 .    as the sampling cadence of stripe 82 and cal - pswdb surveys was much longer than typical flare timescales of minutes to hours @xcite , our flare search relies on single - epoch outliers in the light curves . in order to act as an effective variability discriminant the two bandpasses making up the @xmath42 statistic must be imaged nearly simultaneously to capture the same physical event .",
    "the 2mass @xmath34 bands were imaged simultaneously @xcite , allowing the photometry to be directly compared for each 7.8 second exposure .",
    "the sdss used a drift - scanning technique that produced separate 52.4 second exposures in each filter taken in the order @xmath57 @xcite . as a result the @xmath58 values , for example , come from measurements which were separated by only @xmath01 minute , while the @xmath59 values are derived from data which were separated by almost 5 minutes .",
    "we searched for flares in each of the six @xmath42 distributions separately , but recognize the limitation that flares with timescales of only a few minutes may not have been imaged by all sdss bands .",
    "as such , these rapid events would not yield large @xmath42 values , and may fall below our detection thresholds .    to remove large @xmath42 values from the sample that resulted from a",
    "_ decrease _ in flux in both bands , for example due to photon loss from clouds or eclipses , we required all epochs in our investigation to have @xmath60 for the bluer ( shorter wavelength ) filter in each of the @xmath54 and @xmath56 distributions .",
    "this removed approximately half the epochs in each distribution , as expected .",
    "as discussed in k09 , the @xmath56 distribution , also referred to as the `` null '' distribution , is representative of uncorrelated noise in the light curve .",
    "the @xmath56 distribution was still well modeled by gaussian noise in all filters after the removal of half the epochs .",
    "comparison of the @xmath54 distribution with the @xmath56 yields excesses in the @xmath54 due to candidate flaring epochs .",
    "in this section we explore the selection of flares from our light curves , and the luminosities of the flare candidate epochs .",
    "as discussed above , given our sparse sampling we assume that each flare is observed in only one epoch of our data .",
    "a threshold value for @xmath54 must be chosen from the null distributions to separate flare epochs from the quiescent epochs with statistical fluctuations .",
    "if too high a threshold is chosen , we may lose valuable weak signal in the redder bandpasses by disregarding real flare events .",
    "however , too low a threshold will add significant false positives to the resulting flare rates . using the false discovery rate method @xcite on the @xmath61 distribution",
    ", k09 determined that a conservative cutoff for flares was @xmath62 .",
    "this ensured less than 10% contamination from non - flaring epochs would be included in their final analysis .",
    "we performed the false discovery rate analysis to limit the contamination to 10% in all six of our @xmath56 distributions , and determined @xmath42 thresholds of ( 100 , 100 , 120 , 500 , 50 , 50 ) for @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the @xmath56 distributions using 2mass filters in figure [ phi ] decline rapidly at @xmath64 , nearly an order of magnitude lower values than for the optical filters .",
    "this is indicative of the lower intrinsic stellar variability seen at these wavelengths , and the larger photometric errors in the 2mass survey .",
    "the @xmath42 thresholds are shown as dashed vertical lines in figure [ phi ] .",
    "the number of flaring epochs for each filter combination was very small compared to the total number of observations .",
    "previous studies such as k09 have shown that flare rates for m dwarfs increase as a function of spectral type . to examine this trend we grouped our sample into three spectral type bins ( m0-m1 , m2-m3 , m4-m6 ) .",

    "since the bochanski optical templates only go as short as 3825 , to fully cover the m dwarf spectra in the @xmath3-band we used templates from @xcite . as these are lower resolution than the bochanski templates , we used them only from 2900  to 5000 .",
    "the pickles and bochanski templates are both published in normalized flux units , while the flux - calibrated irtf data we used in the nir are in observed flux .",
    "we found distances to each of the irtf m dwarf standard stars from @xcite , @xcite , , and @xcite using the simbad database , and standard radii from @xcite to convert the observed flux into surface luminosity for each star in the nir .",
    "the normalized optical templates were then scaled to match at 8500 , and or resultant optical / nir spectral energy distributions for the m0 through m6 sub types are shown in figure [ sed ] .",

    "the overall flare sed shape was defined by a 10,000k blackbody continuum .",
    "previous studies have found temperatures as low as @xmath08500k @xcite for flares , while @xcite found evidence for temperatures as high as 13,000k . fit a blackbody temperature of 20,000",
    "k during the brief impulsive phase of an enormous flare on cn leo .",
    "these temperatures rapidly declined , however , with values around 7,00010,000 k for the remainder of the flare event .",
    "shortward of 3646 , we added a second component of h balmer continuum line emission , which was computed from the @xcite radiative hydrodynamic m dwarf atmosphere model .",
    "the balmer continuum was scaled to have 10 times larger surface area coverage than the blackbody component .",
    "the 10:1 scaling was approximately an average of those used by previous studies , with @xcite using values from 3:1 to 16:1 .",
    "our idealized model does not include many detailed emission mechanisms that would alter these fluxes , such as line emission from other elements , or other levels of hydrogen .",
    "using measured spectral line emission from m dwarf flares in the nir from @xcite , we estimate that line emission would contribute an order of magnitude less than our predicted blackbody continuum emission in @xmath34 bands , and is therefore negligible for our analysis . continuum emission from higher levels of hydrogen in the flare atmosphere , and effects from chromospheric back - warming such as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "likely provide the greatest changes to the red optical and nir flare sed .    to investigate the effect of the flare model , we scale it by a surface coverage fraction , ranging from 5@xmath90 to 0.5 , and add it to the m0m6 template spectra . the photometric response to flares in each filter was then calculated by convolving the sdss and 2mass filter transmission curves @xcite to the m0m6 model spectra with and without the flare . in figure [ dmag ]",

    "the resulting increases in flux for the @xmath89 bands were approximately ( 2.7 , 0.62 , 0.19 , 0.06 , 0.03 , 0.01 , 0.01 , 0.01 ) magnitudes respectively .",
    "the extremely blue response of the flare is due to a contrast effect between the intrinsically blue flare model and the underlying red stellar spectrum .",
    "since the m3 spectrum is much redder than the flare model , even large amplitude flares do not give a strong singal in the reddest filters .",
    "however , k09 recovered a very bright flare in the stripe 82 sample , visible in all five passband light curves , on an active m6 star .",
    "this flare had magnitude excursions of ( 5.50 , 3.07 , 2.34 , 0.77 , 0.29 ) for the @xmath39 bands respectively .",
    "our m6 model , scaled to match the @xmath3-band excursion , predicted @xmath39 magnitude excursions of ( 5.5 , 2.5 , 1.2 , 0.3 , 0.1 ) . in the 2mass @xmath34 filters we predicted excursions of approximately ( 0.03 , 0.01 , 0.01 ) .",
    "the coverage for this simulated flare was 0.06% of the stellar surface .",

    "we allowed the blackbody temperature within our model to vary from 8,000k to 13,000k .",

    "using our flare model with the m3 spectral template , we investigated the efficiency of recovering flares from our sample with the @xmath42 statistic .",
    "we first computed the sigma - clipped mean photometric error profiles as a function of observed magnitude for each of the @xmath89 bands in increments of 0.1 mag , shown in figure [ meanerror ] . for each of the m3 stars in our nir time domain sample",
    ", we simulated 200 artificial flares using our model from  5 , with a logarithmically increasing surface area coverage fraction from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "the mean error profiles were then used to select an appropriate photometric error for the resultant apparent magnitudes of each simulated flare in all eight passbands . finally , we calculated the @xmath42 values for each simulated flare on every star .",
    "the result was a `` @xmath42 profile '' , which was a function of both the quiescent apparent magnitude of the star , and the flare amplitude .",
    "these represent the two competing physical quantities , the distance to the star and the size of the flare , which conspire to limit our detection of small flares or flares on distant stars .",
    "this envelope is shown in figure [ response ] as a function of quiescent magnitude on the x - axis , with @xmath42 contour values increasing from black to red .",
    "the @xmath42 profile was smoothed with a kernel of 0.1 magnitudes . because flares are typically characterized by their enhancement of blue flux ,",
    "the corresponding predicted @xmath3-band excursion from our model is shown on the right axis in blue for the @xmath93 bands .        using our described @xmath42 thresholds from  4",
    ", we found that small flares in the @xmath3-band ( @xmath96mag ) would be recovered for every star in the sample with a quiescent magnitude of @xmath97 .",
    "the completeness is a direct function of the photometric error profile , which parallels the @xmath42 threshold curves shown in figure [ response ] .",
    "interestingly , note that in the @xmath98 bands in figure [ response ] , the @xmath42 profiles `` turn up '' for bright stars , since the error profiles begin to increase as stars approach the saturation limit for the sdss . consider a star with a moderate quiescent luminosity in the @xmath3-band ( e.g. @xmath99 ) .",
    "a very large flare such those observed in @xcite and @xcite would result in an observed @xmath3-band magnitude too bright for the sdss photometry , and would therefore be excluded from our analysis",
    ". this would be possible in the @xmath11 , and even @xmath85-band , for bright stars with very large flares .",
    "incompleteness is therefore also expected at the brightest flare luminosities , although these events are rare with duty cycles estimated to be @xmath01 per month on most active stars @xcite .",
    "the error profiles in the @xmath11 , @xmath85 , and @xmath100 filters plotted in figure [ meanerror ] are best suited to monitor small amplitude variations such as eclipses and spot modulation .",
    "figures [ response ] and [ dmag ] clearly show that we are only completely sampling flares larger than @xmath101 in these bands for most of our sample , and thus the @xmath3-band is the most suitable to search for the frequent low - amplitude flares in these stars .",
    "as expected from the model discussion above , only very large flares would be detectable in the nir passbands for the brightest stars in our sample using the 2mass photometric error profile .",
    "our model predicts that a flare with a nearly @xmath102 magnitude increase in the @xmath3-band would be required to detect any significant increase in flux in the cal - pswdb for a nearby m3 type star .",
    "no simulated flares on m3 stars showed enough increase in flux to register as a @xmath103 response in the @xmath34 bands , however .",
    "the flare emission in the nir must therefore be greatly influenced by physics not included in our two - component model , and definitive simultaneous detection of flares in the nir and optical is needed to calibrate this model .",
    "our analysis has extrapolated a well - known two - component flare model into a new wavelength regime , and we therefore provide a prediction for the `` best - case '' to detect m dwarf flares in the nir .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath104 magnitudes is easily observable for many nearby m dwarfs with present day ground based differential photometry .",
    "using the @xmath91 to @xmath105 flare amplitude transformations shown in figure [ dmag ] , we estimated the @xmath91 enhancement for each spectral type required to achieve @xmath106 .",
    "for spectral types m  m6",
    "this yielded a @xmath107(1.4 , 1.8 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.3 , 4.0 , 4.5 ) mag .",
    "the changing shape in the underlying stellar sed in the nir indicates that @xmath7-band flares are detectable from smaller @xmath91 flares at earlier spectral types .",
    "the frequency of flaring has been previously found to increase with spectral type , such as in our figure [ ffrac ] .",
    "the characteristic lifetime of magnetic activity is also highly correlated with spectral type @xcite , and later spectral types m dwarfs are expected to show not only more , but larger amplitude flares ( hilton 2011 phd thesis ) .",
    "this highlights the contrasting effects at work in detecting broadband nir flares : persistently active m0 stars that show large amplitude flares are exceedingly rare , as compared to those at later spectral types .",
    "the higher bolometric luminosity of earlier spectral type stars additionally means much larger energy flares are needed to achieve these large amplitudes .",
    "figure [ ffd_sptype ] shows the observed @xmath3-band flare frequency distribution for each spectral type bin as a function of @xmath91 magnitude .",
    "the total rate of flaring increased with spectral type , and the slopes were very similar for all the distributions , in agreement with results from e. j. hilton ( 2011 phd thesis ) .",
    "a linear fit was found for each log@xmath108 distribution between @xmath109 to avoid false - positives at the low - amplitude end , and incompleteness at high @xmath91 amplitudes . the predicted frequency at which we expect to observe a @xmath110 mag flare , from the corresponding @xmath91 amplitudes , at each spectral type",
    "was then calculated from these fits , and is shown in figure [ rate_sptype ] .",
    "the optimal spectral type to search for these nir flare detections is in our latest type stars , m6 .",
    "the slight up - turn at m0 is due to the more favorable color - contrast between the flare and the star .",
    "the overall trend from m1m6 , however , shows that the strongest effect for all spectral types is the total flaring duty cycle .",
    "this provides one possible reason that the recovered flare rates are higher than expected for m0m1 stars in figure [ ffrac ] .",
    "a new method for calculating the duty cycle of a given amplitude excursion , known as the magnitude likelihood distribution , has been recently put forward by e. j. hilton ( 2011 phd thesis ) . using these magnitude likelihood distributions",
    "we predict a peak duty cycle of @xmath111 for the magnetically active m4 and m5 stars .",
    "for the 54 sec exposures of sdss , this is equal to a frequency of @xmath112 hr@xmath70 , which is consistent with our estimation .",
    "we would encourage future nir flare observers to monitor bright / nearby targets in the latest spectral types possible , at least m4 or later .",
    "promising stars might include gj 1061 , cn leo ( wolf 359 ) , and especially the highly active yz cmi .",

    "each distribution was fit with a linear polynomial in the range @xmath113.,width=336 ]",
    "we have shown that the signatures of flares from m dwarfs are not confined to the bluest bandpasses in large scale photometric surveys .",
    "there is significant response from medium to large flares in @xmath114 bands , and the largest flares are observable in @xmath115 and in some cases into the nir passbands .",
    "this is the first statistical characterization of m dwarf flares in the nir regime .",
    "a self - consistent result between all eight filters shows that while the frequency of flares decreases with increasing luminosity in all filters , the total number of flares recovered decreases with wavelength .",
    "this suggests that like our simplified flare model the underlying sed for flares of all sizes is intrinsically blue .",
    "furthermore , the total rate of flares in all optical bands appears to increase with increasing spectral type , but low - number statistics prevent us from robustly exploring this distribution at nir wavelengths .",
    "the slope of the flare frequency distribution is found to be insensitive to the flare detection threshold below @xmath88 erg s@xmath70 .",
    "mag amplitude flare is expected to be seen on each spectral type , based on our model and measured flare rates .",
    "the numbers below each point are the @xmath91 amplitudes that our flare model predicts from a @xmath110 mag flare at each spectral type.,width=336 ]    we have also presented an implementation of the two - component spectral flare model from @xcite to make predictions of the red - optical and nir response of flares in m dwarfs",
    ". these conversions will be useful in future broadband photometric studies of m dwarfs to predict the contamination from flares across a wider wavelength space .",
    "flares in the @xmath7-band are predicted to be detected most frequently in spectral types from m4 to m6 , with rates of @xmath116 hr@xmath70 .",
    "medium sized flares larger than 0.5 magnitudes in @xmath3 were found to occur at a rate of one per few thousand sdss exposures for m dwarfs .",
    "low - amplitude flare rates are limited by the photometric precision of the survey in question , and lsst will detect even smaller amplitude flares from these stars , and will increase the rate at which variability from these sources is detected .",
    "lsst will also employ a @xmath117-filter , with a central wavelength between that of @xmath115 and @xmath7 . using the `` @xmath118 '' filter curve for lsst ,",
    "our two - component flare model from figure [ model ] predicts a flare amplitude of @xmath119 mag .",
    "the increased photometric sensitivity will therefore allow lsst to routinely detect large flares in this nir bandpass for bright stars , providing useful constraints on the sed structure of flares at long wavelengths    finally , we have shown that the intrinsic sed of a flare , convolved with the photometric characteristics of a given survey , can greatly affect the sample of flares recovered .",
    "the cadence and integration times will also affect the recovery of flares .",
    "short exposures such as in 2mass capture the near instantaneous luminosity of an event , while longer exposure times may encapsulate entire flare events .",
    "we anticipate a day when this problem can be inverted , using orders of magnitude larger samples of flare candidate epochs in many bands , as well as spectra , from next - generation surveys to probe the underlying flare sed ( or its deviations ) across the population of m dwarfs in the galaxy .",
