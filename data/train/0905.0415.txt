    "a well - known kinematic dynamo model goes back to the work of ponomarenko @xcite , who found that magnetic modes could be amplified in a flow field in cylindrical geometry ( depending only on distance from the axis ) , which generally possesses helical streamlines . in recent studies",
    "this ponomarenko dynamo has been investigated when the helical flow is modulated in time @xcite , with a focus on the dynamo threshold .",
    "the aim here is to quantify the effect of simple time - periodic fluctuations on the mean flow , and the effect of these on the threshold for magnetic growth .",
    "the main conclusion is that the dynamo threshold is larger than the one obtained without fluctuations , suggesting that large scale fluctuations are not desirable when optimizing a dynamo experiment . in dynamo experiments ,",
    "such large scale fluctuations have been avoided simply by adding inner walls @xcite or a flow - stabilizing ring @xcite . a further experiment in preparation @xcite",
    "is based on a single helical flow , again avoiding large scale fluctuations .    the above simulations @xcite were purely numerical and in order to give some theoretical backing to the results it is necessary to use an asymptotic limit where approximate results can be obtained .",
    "the steady ponomarenko dynamo @xcite has been studied for @xmath0 in the kinematic case @xcite and equilibrated solutions have been found taking into account the nonlinear feedback on the flow @xcite . in both cases",
    "the underlying flow is steady , and our aim here is to extend the kinematic results to the case of oscillatory flow fields .",
    "we therefore adopt the limit of large magnetic reynolds number ( @xmath0 ) , generally much above the threshold .",
    "although our aim is to derive asymptotic results which are valid for this general class of flows , with an eye to experimental dynamos and numerical simulations , we note that ponomarenko dynamos may also occur in bipolar jet - like outflows commonly observed in protostellar systems , in which magnetic field probably plays an important role . though it is argued that such magnetic fields are produced inside the protostellar disk @xcite we can not exclude the existence of a ponomarenko type dynamo in such a helical jet in which strong time fluctuations may also occur .    here",
    "we assume a time - periodic flow depending only on radius , limit our investigation to the kinematic approximation , and study the asymptotic limit of large @xmath1 ( section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "our analysis will be compared to direct numerical simulations for three cases ( section [ sec3 ] ) : stationary flow and oscillatory flow with zero mean flow ( zm ) , or non - zero mean flow ( nzm ) .",
    "finally in section [ sec4 ] we generalize our analysis to the case of time - varying resonant radius .",
    "the time evolution of the magnetic field is given by the dimensionless induction equation @xmath2 with @xmath3 and where we have adopted a diffusion time scale for our time variable ( in contrast to @xcite , but in accord with @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a time - dependent helical flow expressed in cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are smooth functions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a given function of time . in the stationary case @xmath10 , and for the non - stationary case we will consider two functional forms for the time - dependence , @xmath11 the ` zero - mean ' and ` non - zero mean ' flows , respectively .    for the linear , kinematic dynamo problem we may consider a magnetic field of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the azimuthal and vertical wave numbers of the field and @xmath15 is a phase , put in for convenience , that we will choose shortly .",
    "the solenoidality of the field , @xmath16 , expressed in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath17 shows that it is enough to solve the induction equation for @xmath18 and @xmath19 only .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for a stationary flow the magnetic field is generated in a resonant layer located at @xmath20 , where the magnetic field lines are aligned with the shear and thus minimize their diffusion . in equation ( [ velocity ] ) we see that since there is the same time - dependent factor @xmath21 multiplying angular and axial velocities , this radius is independent of time , and so this surface is fixed and given by @xmath22 for more complex time - dependence @xmath23 may vary with time , leading to a succession of growing and damping magnetic field states @xcite . in section [ secres ] of this paper",
    "we will consider the velocity field in ( [ velocity ] ) with @xmath23 fixed , and we assume that @xmath23 lies in the fluid , with @xmath24 ( otherwise modes are strongly damped ) . for the more general case of distinct time - dependence for angular and axial flows , where @xmath23 does vary with time ,",
    "the equations are set out and discussed in section [ secnonres ] .    with a given resonant surface @xmath20 the leading action of the flow on the field",
    "is simply advection of the mode by the angular and axial velocities , on the fast advective timescale @xmath25 .",
    "we take this out of consideration by defining the phase @xmath15 as @xmath26 to leave behind only evolution through dynamo action , diffusion and reconnection , on slower time - scales .    introducing",
    "( [ velocity ] ) , ( [ b ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) in ( [ induc ] ) , we find @xmath27 where the laplacian operator @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 in the highly conducting limit @xmath30 we adopt the smooth ponomarenko dynamo scaling @xcite , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a time - scale on which the dynamo mode grows , intermediate between the @xmath33 diffusive time - scale and the @xmath34 advective time - scale .",
    "this scaling gives a magnetic mode localized at the radius @xmath20 and it is known that the final formulae obtained with this choice of scaling give the ` richest ' asymptotic picture including both the case @xmath35 and the peak growth rates , achieved at @xmath36 .",
    "setting @xmath37 together with the @xmath38 and @xmath39 expansion at @xmath20 , @xmath40 we obtain from ( [ 2rbis ] ) and ( [ 2phibis ] ) at leading order in @xmath41 , @xmath42 with @xmath43 from ( [ 3r ] ) and ( [ 3phi ] ) we immediately see how the dynamo works : the differential rotation @xmath44 stretches radial field @xmath45 to generate @xmath46 , and the diffusion of @xmath46 in cylindrical geometry then regenerates @xmath45 . for the flows considered below @xmath47 , and for simplicity we will take this to be the case in what follows : there are insignificant changes if this quantity is negative .",
    "these equations are solved by an exact ansatz involving time - dependent , complex gaussian functions .",
    "we put these in , at the same time rescaling using constants @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , to eliminate as many parameters as possible , with @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a new time scale .",
    "we now fix the constants with @xmath54 and we are left with the following system of odes in @xmath55 to solve @xmath56 where the constant @xmath57 and the time - dependent factor is @xmath58 .",
    "( note that modes with more radial structure can be studied , taking the form of two time - dependent polynomials times a gaussian in ( [ layer ] ) , but these will be subdominant ) .",
    "the equation for @xmath59 is nonlinear , while those for @xmath60 and @xmath61 are linear .",
    "the exponential growth rate @xmath62 of the magnetic field components @xmath60 and @xmath61 depends only on the parameter @xmath63 , which captures the local geometry of the helical streamlines @xcite , and the form of the time - dependence @xmath64 . from ( [ resonnance ] ) and ( [ c ] ) we have @xmath65 showing that @xmath63 depends only on the geometry of the velocity field .",

    ", then we need to be careful to check the condition that the width given by ( [ layerwidth ] ) is small , to validate the asymptotic theory .",
    "for example if we fix @xmath89 as @xmath86 we have @xmath90 from ( [ linkfreq ] ) and as @xmath59 turns out to be bounded in this limit ( of low frequencies , so similar to the stationary case ) this condition is verified .",

    "note that for stationary flow the corresponding criterion is @xmath129 for magnetic field amplification . to see the relevance of these results ,",
    "consider the spiral couette flow , which is simply the general solution for differentially rotating flow forced by rotating , translating cylindrical boundaries @xmath221 this corresponds to @xmath222 , and so satisfies the condition in the stationary case : dynamo action was observed in @xcite .",
    "if the motion of the boundaries is now periodic with zero mean , and sufficiently slow that the above functions are just multiplied by @xmath223 , then figure 2 shows that dynamo action becomes marginal provided @xmath224 is large .",
    "of course the full picture for any boundary forcing is complicated by the development of stokes layers unless it is slow compared with viscous time - scales .",
    "nonetheless the key point is that flows with larger values of @xmath225 over a range of radii are likely to be more efficient as dynamos in non - stationary as well as stationary flows , and this consideration could be important in optimizing experiments and understanding experimental or numerical results .",
    "we also considered flow fluctuations in which components are out of phase , leading to a time - dependent resonant radius .",
    "the results show that this inhibits the dynamo action , confirming previous results obtained for a cellular type of flow @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations considered in this paper have a very simple structure , and it would be a natural extension to consider fluctuating flows that carried field across streamlines , in other words depending also on @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "this would lose the separation of variables employed here and make the study more numerical , unless averaging is done analytically , which would generally give an alpha effect @xcite .",
    "other possible interesting developments would be to consider random time - dependence , which increases the complexity of the system , especially close to the threshold @xcite , and to include some of the effects of nonlinear feedback on the flow field @xcite .",
