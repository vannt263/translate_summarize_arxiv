    "in f - theory guts the trilinear yukawa couplings are realised at the intersections of three matter curves where the zero - modes of two fermion fields and a higgs boson reside .",
    "the structure of the zero - mode wavefunctions is found by solving the corresponding differential equations emerging from the twisted eight - dimensional yang - mills action  @xcite . the third generation up , down and charged lepton mass matrices",
    "are then computed in terms of the integrals of overlapping wavefunctions at the intersection point of three matter curves  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , assuming that higher order non - renormalizable yukawa couplings are generated through mediation of heavy string modes and/or kaluza - klein states , the calculation of all entries in the fermion mass matrices can be reduced to a similar computation . in fact , in this approach a rigorous and consistent application of the described method can be developed  @xcite , by computing the relevant integrals for the nr - terms involving zero - mode and massive kk - mode overlapping wavefuctions .",
    "the complete calculation of all @xmath1 yukawa entries for the entire charged fermion mass spectrum shows that all the yukawa coefficients are found within a reasonable range of values ( @xmath2 ) while the predicted fermion mass eigenvalues and cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm)-mixing in accordance to the experimental expectations .",
    "the tree - level yukawa couplings are computed by the wavefunction overlap integrals @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the compact 4-d manifold wrapped by 7-brane surface associated to the gauge symmetry ( here @xmath0 ) . to compute the integral we use our knowledge of the wavefunctions profile close to the intersection point . for localized solutions",
    "the zero - mode equations lead to a gaussian profile of the general form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a mass parameter related to a background higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 complex coordinates on @xmath4 and @xmath9 are @xmath10 charges ( @xmath11 ) . to make a reliable computation of the yukawa couplings we also need a consistent normalization of the wavefunction . for a generic form of a wavefunction",
    "we have @xmath12 the factor @xmath13 is the result of the gaussian integration along the coordinate normal to the curve .",
    "the factor @xmath14 is introduced to account for the integration along the coordinate parametrising the curve .",
    "the mass scale @xmath6 is naturally associated to the compactification scale @xmath15 on @xmath4 , while the parameter @xmath16 ` measures ' the integration along the matter curve inside the gut surface @xmath4 , thus clearly @xmath17 and one naturally expects that @xmath18 .",
    "from renormalization group analysis we can see  @xcite that it is possible to obtain a scale independent normalization given by @xmath19 where the exponent @xmath20 is related to kk - massive mode threshold corrections expressed in terms of the analytic torsion @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the integral for three generic wavefunctions of the form ( [ yuk ] ) with arbitrary charges @xmath22 participating in the triple intersection the yukawa couplings , gives  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 from charge conservation in the triple intersection , while @xmath11 etc .      in the present context",
    "we have assumed that our local f - theory gut is @xmath25 with the top and bottom yukawa couplings appearing in triple intersections of @xmath4 with other seven branes . locally the @xmath26 symmetry is enhanced and in practice the yukawa couplings should also be invariant under additional @xmath10 symmetries . in the spectral cover approach we consider the @xmath0 embedding into the exceptional symmetry @xmath27 which is the highest symmetry in the elliptic fibration .",
    "we assume the background field configuration @xmath28 with weights @xmath29 along @xmath30 satisfying the tracelessness condition @xmath31 .",
    "we turn on a non - zero vev for @xmath28 which breaks the symmetry down to @xmath32 . at the intersection",
    "points where the yukawa couplings are formed two appropriate linear combinations of these @xmath10 s are preserved .",
    "the @xmath0 representations are characterised by various combinations of @xmath29 s as shown in table  [ rest ] .",
    "an @xmath0 gauge invariant coupling must also comply with the cancellation of the @xmath29 charges . in practice",
    "this means that for a given allowed coupling either the @xmath29 must come in pairs with opposite sign , or their sum has to satisfy the traceless condition .",

    "they emerge through the mediation of kk - massive modes and all yukawa coefficients are calculable using the above procedure . here",
    "we give a specific model with representation content given in table [ content ] which is also capable of generating doublet - triplet splitting through the flux mechanism .",

    "it can be seen  @xcite that the above are in accordance with the quark mass ratios and ckm mixing .",
