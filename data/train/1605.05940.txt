    "the density of a cluster evolving under the influence of tidal shocks and two - body relaxation can be found by adding the change in @xmath14 due to tidal shocks ( equation  [ eq : edotshock ] ) and relaxation ( equation  [ eq : edotrelax ] ) @xmath91 we use this in the general expression for the energy ( equation  [ eq : de ] ) and express @xmath92 ( equations  [ eq : edotshock ] and [ eq : edotrelax ] ) .",
