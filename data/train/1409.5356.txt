    "silicene is the subject of considerable attention due to its exotic electronic properties and promising applications in si nanoelectronics that are similar to those of graphene.@xcite the similarity between silicene and graphene is due to the fact that si and c belong to the same group iv in the periodic table .",
    "generally , @xmath2 hybridization is favourable for si whereas @xmath3 hybridization is energetically favourable in case of graphene .",
    "experimentally , the growth of silicene on ag(110 ) @xcite , ag(111 ) @xcite , zrb@xmath4 @xcite , and ir(111 ) @xcite have been reported .",
    "in addition , silicene on semiconducting substrates ( @xmath5-bn and sic ) @xcite have been studied and demonstrating that these substrates could be promising for producing free - standing silicene .",
    "based on first - principles calculations , it has been shown that the electronic structure of silicene is particularly interesting due to the formation of graphene - like dispersion at the fermi level ( dirac - like cone).@xcite the vibrational properties measured from phonon dispersion calculations show that the silicene lattice can be stable up to a biaxial strain of 17%.@xcite in addition , the effect of the strain on the mechanical properties of the free - standing silicene has been demonstrated to have larger intrinsic stiffness as compared to unstrained case .",
    "@xcite the structural and magnetic properties of 3@xmath6 transition metal doped silicene have been reported and it has been found that transition metals are strongly bound to the silicene sheet with higher binding energies compared to graphene.@xcite moreover , adsorption of fe and cr on planar and buckled silicene has been studied and it was found that fe and cr bind strongly to buckled silicene as compared to the planar one.@xcite based on the experimental and theoretical studies , it is expected that silicene can easily be integrated in electronic devices .",
    "the interactions between graphene and different chemical functional groups have potential applications in graphene - based devices.@xcite the physisorption of small molecules on graphene is of considerable interest since absorbents enhance the chemical reactivity of graphene.@xcite it has also been demonstrated that several organic molecules have potential to modify the electronic properties of graphene - based systems @xcite , and that introducing dopants can enhance the interaction , which could be relevant for sensing devices.@xcite dopants in silicene also significantly modify the electronic and magnetic behaviour of the pristine silicene.@xcite in particular , transition metal doped silicene can host a quantum anomalous hall effect , which is highly desirable for spintronic applications.@xcite    a large enhancement of spin - orbit coupling of approximately 2.5  mev has been observed for hydrogen molecule adsorbed graphene , which is sufficient to realize the spin hall effect.@xcite recently , the molecular adsorption and its effects on graphene have been studied in both experiment and theory.@xcite inverse gas chromatographyhas been used to investigate the adsorption energies and enthalpies of molecules onto graphene . excellent agreement between experiment and computational approach",

    "in particular , the structural and electronic properties are addressed to quantify the adsorption energy and the effect on the electronic structure .",
    "in addition the effective mass of the electron has been estimated and indicates larger mobilities in these systems .",
    "furthermore , the effect of doping li atoms in pristine and acetone adsorbed silicene is addressed . in particular ,",
    "the variation of the adsorption energy with the number of li atoms has been focused .",
    "our results show that the systems under consideration are promising for tuning the band gap and hence could have great potential for silicene based devices .",
    "unless otherwise noted , all the calculations were performed using density functional theory ( dft ) within the generalized gradient approximation in the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof parametrization @xcite as implemented in the pwscf code.@xcite we include the van der waals interaction ( dft - d ) in order to achieve an accurate description of the dispersion.@xcite a high plane wave cutoff energy of 816 ev and a monkhorst - pack @xmath7 k - mesh were used for all the structures under consideration .",
    "a @xmath8 supercell of silicene with a lattice constant of @xmath9   was employed . in addition , a vacuum layer of 20   was used in order to avoid artificial interactions due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the supercell contains 32 si atoms and a single molecule ( acetone , acetonitrile , ammonia , benzene , methane , methanol , ethanol , and toluene ) adsorbed on it .",
    "based on the similar kinds of the modelling in graphene , this supercell is sufficient for our calculations.@xcite the adsorption density is low enough such that interaction between the molecule and its periodic images is prevented .",

    "this can have strong effects on the adsorption energy .",
    "the adsorption energy of the molecules on silicene is calculated as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total energy of the isolated molecule , @xmath13 is the total energy of a @xmath8 pristine silicene supercell , and @xmath14 is the total energy of the molecule adsorbed silicene .",

    "theoretically , the adsorption energy of ammonia on graphene has been reported to be 0.11 ev @xcite ; this value is approximately four times lower than ammonia adsorbed on silicene .",
    "this indicates that silicene is an extremely good candidate compared to graphene to detect or sensor harmful gases , like ammonia .",
    "in general our data for the adsorption energy shows that these molecules are more strongly bound to silicene as compared to graphene and hence silicene could be the better host material for these molecules , which makes it a potential candidate material in sensor as well as electronic device applications .       point .",

    "the electronic structure of pristine silicene has been calculated with three different approaches ; ( i ) dft - d , ( ii ) optb88-vdw functional , and ( iii ) the gw approximation using the vasp package @xcite , see fig .  2 . here  opt \" is the the optimised exchange functionals @xcite , g refers to the one - electron green s function , and w refers to the screened coulomb interaction , and their product  gw \" is the quasi - particle self - energy corrections methods.@xcite it is found that the band gap is 1.92 mev , 1.95 mev , and 1.99 mev by using dft - d , the optb88-vdw functional , and the gw approximation , respectively .",
    "the obtained result agrees well with the available reports @xcite and hence in the following only the dft - d calculations have been taken into account .",
    "modifications in the electronic structure can be achieved by applying strain / electric fields @xcite , and doping.@xcite however , the impact of molecular adsorption on the electronic structure has not been explored .",
    "the electronic structure of the systems under consideration are illustrated in fig .",
    "the electronic structure of acetone adsorbed silicene is strongly modified resulting in e@xmath23 ev , see fig .",
    "this gap opening can be attributed to the strong structural distortion , which breaks the structural symmetry .",
    "such a modification has also been found in case of the transition metal decorated silicene.@xcite due to the significant band gap as compared to pristine silicene , the system is expected to be of potential use for electronic device applications such as field effect transistors .",
    "the band gap can be further increased by the application of an electric field such that the system could be promising for opto - electronic devices .",
    "due to the weak interaction between silicene and acetonitrile , a small band gap of 0.006 ev is achieved , see fig .",
    "3(b ) , which is still about 4 times higher than that of pristine silicene ( @xmath24 mev ) .",
    "in case of ammonia adsorbed silicene , a band gap of 0.103 ev is obtained , see fig .",
    "the fact is that silicene is locally distorted around the ammonia adsorbed areas .",
    "the band structure of benzene adsorbed silicene is addressed in fig .",
    "due to a weak interaction between silicene and benzene a band gap of 0.007 ev is obtained .",
    "a band gap of 0.002 ev is obtained in case of methane adsorbed silicene , see fig .",
    "3(e ) , which is similar to that of pristine silicene .",
    "this indicates only a minimal interaction between silicene and methane .",
    "in addition , larger band gaps of 0.011 ev , 0.017 ev , and 0.208 ev are obtained for methanol , ethanol , and toluene adsorbed silicene , see figs .",
    "3(f ) , 3(g ) , and 3(h ) , respectively .",
    "a clear trend is observed between the band gap opening and the adsorption energy .",
    "while the correlation between band gap and adsorption energy is not perfect , we note that stronger adsorption provides a larger band gap opening and weaker adsorption provides a smaller band gap opening , which can be clearly seen from the data presented in fig .",
    "4(a ) , this behaviour agrees well with the band gap engineered by adsorption of aromatic molecules on graphene.@xcite for instance , the adsorption energy of acetone is highest and acetone - adsorbed silicene has a very large band gap",
    ". the band gap opening can be understand by looking at the charge transfer from the adsorbent to the host silicene .",
    "charge transfer between adsorbent molecule and silicene provides an internal electric field , which indeed breaks the sublattice symmetry in silicene and opens a band gap at the dirac point ( at the k - high symmetric point ) .",
    "the internal electric field can be understood by using a parallel plate capacitor model , which has been already well established for 2d systems , such as graphene @xcite , silicene @xcite , and germanene.@xcite this can be calculated by using @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the lwdin transferred charge , vacuum permittivity , and silicene lattice constant , respectively .",
    "previous theoretical calculations already demonstrated that the band gap of silicene / germanene increases linearly with increasing external electric field @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we find that the largest amount of the charge transfer ( 0.483 electron ) from the adsorbent to silicene provides the highest value of the band gap ( for acetone adsorption ) , and the smallest amount of charge transfer ( 0.004 electron ) for methane induces a minimal value of the band gap , see fig .",
    "the calculated values of the charge transfer are summarized in table 2 . moreover ,",
    "the obtained value of the band gap can be enhanced by applying an electric field , which is relevant for the design of molecular based electronic devices .",
    "experimentally , molecular based electronic devices , in particular field effect transistors , have already been designed for molecular oxygen adsorbed graphene @xcite and fluorinated graphene @xcite and hence it is expected that molecule adsorbed silicene would also be useful to construct silicene based devices such as field effect transistors .          the energy dispersion relation for the gapped 2d systems , where charge carriers behave as massive dirac fermions , graphene and silicene for example , can be obtained @xcite by @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 represents the conduction and valence bands , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are wave vectors along the x- and y - directions , and @xmath33 is an effective mass of the electrons .",
    "it is calculated as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the band gap and @xmath36 is the fermi velocity , which is @xmath37 ms@xmath38 for pristine silicene.@xcite it has been demonstrated that the layer - layer interaction is the key factor in order to control / tune the band gap in graphene systems , however , the value of the @xmath33 is enhanced largely as a function of the increment in the band gap , which has poor performance for device application because of smaller mobility .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to keep the value of @xmath33 as small as possible.@xcite the calculated values of the effective mass of the electron are found to be 0.001 @xmath39 to 0.166 @xmath39 , see table 2 .",
    "these values are significantly smaller as compared to doped graphene @xcite and double - gate graphene nanoribbon field - effect transistors.@xcite hence , doped silicene would provide larger mobility , which is good for the device performance .",
    "interestingly , it is observed that the smaller effective mass for the molecule having smaller adsorption energy and vice - versa .",
    "the electron mobility can be evaluated as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the momentum relaxation time . at this point ,",
    "the exact value of @xmath41 is unknown and hence it is not possible to estimate the exact value of @xmath42 .",
    "however , the smaller values of the effective mass of the electron ensure that the @xmath42 in the doped silicene systems should be very high , even higher than those in the case of graphene and its derivatives .          in this section",
    ", we explore the effect of li atom doping in pristine silicene and in acetone adsorbed silicene .",
    "we start from single li atom doping in one of the hollow sites , see the prototype structures in figs .",
    "4(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we chose acetone adsorbed silicene because the adsorption energy is highest in this case out of all the eight molecules discussed before and we aim to understand how the adsorption energy and electronic property influenced by the doping of li atoms .",
    "the li atom occupies the hollow site without creating any distortion to the si hexagon ( no modification in the si@xmath10si bond lengths ) .",
    "the average distance of the li atom to the silicene sheet is about 1.72   and 1.68   in case of pristine and acetone adsorbed silicene , respectively .",
    "the obtained distance agrees well with the experimentally and theoretically observed value for li doped graphene @xcite and theoretical prediction for li doped silicene.@xcite the obtained value of the adsorption energy for a single li atom doped silicene is found to be @xmath102.76 ev , this value agrees well with li doping in nitrogen mediated silicene.@xcite furthermore , the adsorption energy decreases monotonically with increasing the number of li atoms in silicene , see fig .",
    "5(a ) , which agrees well with o doped graphene @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that li doped monolayer / bilayer graphene supported by the sic substrate can have high potential to construct nano - scale li - ion batteries.@xcite similarly , li doped silicene can also be a potential candidate for li - ion batteries.@xcite the lack of structural distortion discussed above is a significant factor here also , since structural reconstruction with li motion during charging / discharging is undesirable .",
    "the adsorption energy of single li atom doping in acetone adsorbed silicene is found to be @xmath103.05 ev , higher than for li doped pristine silicene .",
    "this indicates that the acetone molecule has a significance influence on the adsorption of li atoms , which also indicates that one can use molecular adsorption ( acetone for example ) in order to achieve higher energy for li adsorption .",
    "in addition , the strength of adsorption of an acetone molecule in the presence of a li atom is about 5 times higher than that of adsorption of acetone on pristine silicene , which means that depending on the need , one can include li atom during the acetone molecule adsorption on silicene . the value of the adsorption energy decreases with increasing the number of li atoms , see fig .",
    "the reduction of the adsorption energy can be understood by possible li - li interactions . in fig .",
    "5(c ) , the electronic structure of li doped pristine silicene along the @xmath43-k - m-@xmath43 path is shown .",
    "the dirac - like cone in pristine silicene shifts below the fermi level by 0.36 ev by providing a gap of 0.03 ev .",
    "the shifting of the dirac - like cone can be attributed to the charge transfer from the li atom to the si atoms of the silicene hexagon , amounting to 0.83 electrons . in addition",
    ", the opening of the band gap is due to the hexagonal symmetry breaking.@xcite moreover , a gap of 0.27 ev below the fermi level by 0.06 ev is obtained in case of li doping on acetone molecule adsorbed silicene ( see fig .  5 ( d ) ) , which is in fact due to the same reason as for li doping on pristine silicene .",
    "thus , this material can also have potential for use in molecule based li - ion batteries .",
    "in conclusion , using van der waals density functional theory ( dft - d ) , the structural and electronic properties of acetone , acetonitrile , ammonia , benzene , methane , methanol , ethanol , and toluene adsorbed silicene have been studied .",
    "the obtained values of the adsorption energy vary from @xmath0 ev to @xmath1 ev for acetone to toluene , respectively .",
    "these values are higher than those for similar molecules adsorbed graphene , which indicates that silicene could be a better candidate as compared to graphene to detect the organic molecules and hence to tune the electronic properties .",
    "in addition , band structure calculations were performed .",
    "the calculated band gaps range from 0.006 ev to 0.35 ev for acetonitrile to acetone , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the gap can be enhanced by applying an electric field , which , indeed , could be potential to design the molecular based electronic devices .",
    "our calculated values of the effective mass of the electron are found to be smaller as compared to the graphene counterpart and hence we expect larger mobility , which should be of great importance for silicene - based electronic devices .",
    "in addition , the effect of li atoms in pristine and acetone adsorbed silicene is discussed .",
    "it is found that the adsorption energy is reduced with increasing the number of the li atoms in the systems .",
    "the results show that li doped pristine / acetone adsorbed silicene can be an alternative candidate for li - ion batteries as li doped graphene has a great potential for constructing li - ion batteries .",
