    "in this talk i would like to address the question about how to incorporate the heavy particle mass effects into the photon structure functions .",
    "this talk is based on the works done in collaboration with yoshio kitadono , ryo sahara , ken sasaki , takahiro ueda and yutaka yoshida .",
    "now let me make some remarks on why the photon structure is so interesting .",
    "first of all , it provides a good probe to study the qcd dynamics in perturbation theory .",
    "the unpolarized virtual photon structure function @xmath0 was studied up to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) and the polarized virtual photon structure function @xmath1 was investigated to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the qcd sum rule for the first moment of @xmath1 has attracted much attention in the literature since it is related to the axial anomaly . in this",
    "talk we investigate the heavy particle mass effects on the photon structure functions including the polarized structure function .",
    "here we investigate two - photon processes ( figure 1 ) with the kinematical region where the mass squared of the probe photon ( @xmath2 ) is much larger than that of the target photon ( @xmath3 ) which is in turn much bigger than the @xmath4 , the qcd scale parameter squared .",
    "the advantage for studying the virtual photon target is that we can calculate whole structure functions up to next - leading - order ( nlo ) , in contrast to the real photon target where there remain uncalculable non - perturbative pieces .",
    "e@xmath5 collision experiments ]",
    "the structure function @xmath6 for the real photon target ( @xmath7 ) was first studied in the parton model @xcite and then studied to the leading order ( lo ) qcd based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) in ref.@xcite .",
    "the next - to - leading order qcd computation of @xmath6 was performed in the ope and renormalization group ( rg ) method by bardeen and buras @xcite and in the qcd - improved parton model by glck and reya @xcite and fontannaz and pilon @xcite and by other people quoted in ref.@xcite .    for a virtual photon target ( @xmath8 )",
    "the unpolarized photon structure function @xmath9 to lo in qcd was studied in ref.@xcite and to nlo in ref.@xcite .",
    "the master formula for the @xmath10-th moment to nlo is given by @xmath11~ , \\label{master}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are computed from the one- and two - loop anomalous dimensions together with one - loop coefficient functions . all of them are shown to be renormalization - scheme independent .",
    "@xmath16 is the qcd running coupling constant , @xmath17 is the one - loop beta function , and @xmath18 denote the eigenvalues of one - loop anomalous dimensions @xmath19 .",
    "we compute the deviation arising from heavy quark mass effects on the photon matrix elements of twist-2 quark and gluon operators and the corresponding coefficient functions to nlo qcd @xcite .",
    "the moment of @xmath0 can be decomposed as @xmath20 where the additional moment due to mass effects reads @xmath21 \\right . \\nnb\\\\ & & \\left.\\hspace{-1 cm }              + \\sum_{i=\\pm , ns } \\delta \\mathcal{b}_{i}^{n }                \\left [ 1 - \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha_s(q^2 ) }                      { \\alpha_s(p^2 ) } \\right)^{d_{i}^n+1 }             \\right ]          + \\delta \\mathcal{c}^{n }   \\hspace{0.2 cm }        \\right ] + \\mathcal{o}(\\alpha_s)~,\\nnb \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .    in the massive quark",
    "limit : @xmath24 the deviations of the the coefficients turn out to be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the heavy - quark charge and the average charge squared is defined as @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the number of active flavors and the deviation of operator matrix element @xmath29 is @xmath30.\\nnb\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the figure 2 shows the theoretical evaluation with charm quark mass effects compared to the pluto s experimental data @xcite for the effective structure function @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the longitudinal structure function . the theoretical prediction ( red curve ) with the charm quark",
    "mass effects shows the trend of reducing the massless qcd calculation ( purple curve ) and becomes consistent with the experimental data .",
    "also shown is the theoretical curve ( blue curve ) with the resummation prescription given in @xcite .     to nlo in qcd with charm quark mass effects compared to pluto data for @xmath33 , @xmath34gev@xmath35 , @xmath36gev@xmath35 , @xmath37gev  @xcite ]",
    "we now turn to the polarized photon structure function @xmath1 .",
    "let us first consider massless quark contributions to the photon structure functions",
    ".    for a real photon target ( @xmath7 ) , bass , brodsky and schmidt have shown that the 1st moment of @xmath38 vanishes to all orders of @xmath16 in qcd @xcite : @xmath39 now the question is what about the @xmath40 moment of the virtual photon case . by replacing the @xmath41 with @xmath42 in ( [ master ] ) and taking @xmath43 limit ,",
    "the first three terms vanish . denoting @xmath44 , the @xmath45-th quark charge and @xmath28 , the number of active flavors",
    ", we have @xmath46 we can now go to @xmath47 corrections which turn out to be @xcite : @xmath48 + { \\cal o}(\\alpha\\alpha_s^2).\\label{sum - rule - nlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this result coincides with the one obtained by narison , shore and veneziano @xcite , apart from the overall sign for the definition of @xmath1 .",
    "we then extended this nlo result to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculation , which is @xmath49 , where we need the 3-loop anomalous dimensions as well as 2-loop coefficient functions @xcite .",
    "the same formalism can be applied to the heavy quark mass effects as in the case of unpolarized structure functions .",
    "of course we have to replace the one- and two - loop anomalous dimensions as well as the one - loop coefficient functions by the polarized counterparts .",
    "in addition we put the operator matrix elements with the photon states .",
    "namely @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us first consider the heavy quark mass effects on the first moment of the virtual photon structure function @xmath51 . to the lowest order the first moment",
    "is given by _",
    "0 ^ 1 dx g_1^(x , q^2,p^2)= ^n=1+o ( _ s ) . for the massless case",
    "we have ^n=1=12_0e^4_n_f ( b_g^n+_ng^)|_n=1 = -24_0n_fe^4_n_f , where @xmath52 . now in the presence of the heavy quark , the @xmath28-th flavor , with the charge @xmath53 : ^n=1=24_0e_h^4  .",
    "hence we find that the heavy quark mass effects lead to & & _ 0 ^ 1 dx g_1^(x , q^2,p^2)= ( c^n=1+^n=1 ) + & & = -_i=1^n_f-1e_i^4+o ( _ s ) .",
    "thus the heavy quark decouples from the sum rule .",
    "this argument can be extended to the order @xmath47 and the sum rule becomes eq.([sum - rule - nlo ] ) where @xmath28 is replaced by @xmath54 .",
    "we now investigate the heavy quark mass effects on the virtual photon structure function @xmath1 as a function of the bjorken variable @xmath55 @xcite . in figure 3",
    "we have plotted the theoretical prediction for the structure function @xmath51 in the case of @xmath56gev@xmath35 and @xmath36gev@xmath35 , where @xmath33 and the heavy quark is the charm quark with mass squared @xmath57gev@xmath35 .     in units of @xmath58 with and without the charm quark",
    "mass effects for @xmath33 , @xmath56gev@xmath35 , @xmath36gev@xmath35 ]     in units of @xmath58 with and without the bottom quark mass effects for @xmath60 , @xmath61gev@xmath35 , @xmath62gev@xmath35 ]    note that the polarized structure function for the massive case ( red curve ) is suppressed in the large @xmath55 region compared to the massless case ( blue curve ) and becomes less negative for small @xmath55 region when the charm quark mass effect is taken into account . varying the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the kinematical region where the charm quark can be regarded as the heavy quark we get the similar behaviors .",
    "we have also shown in figure 4 , the structure function for the the case of @xmath61gev@xmath35 and @xmath62gev@xmath35 , where @xmath60 and the heavy quark is the bottom quark with mass squared @xmath63gev@xmath35 .",
    "we note that the deviation from massless case is almost negligible , since the charge factor is much smaller compared to the charm case i.e. @xmath64 .",
    "we have also applied our formalism for the photon structure functions in supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) where there exist squarks and gluinos in addition to the quarks and gluons .",
    "the squark contribution in the parton model was studied in @xcite . for the sqcd",
    "radiative corrections , we based our argument on the parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) which satisfy the dglap - type evolution equation .",
    "the heavy mass effects can be incorporated by the boundary conditions where we require the pdf for each particle to vanish at @xmath65 ( @xmath45=gluino , squark , heavy quark ) . by solving the coupled boundary conditions we can determine the initial conditions and then we get the solution for the moment of the each pdf . by performing the inverse mellin transform",
    "we finally get structure functions . in figure 5",
    "we have plotted @xmath9 as a function of @xmath55 .",
    "there we have also taken into account the threshold effects @xmath66 with @xmath67 .     in supersymmetric qcd where heavy particle mass effects are taken into account @xcite ]",
    "we note that at small @xmath55 there is no significant difference between massless and massive qcd , while there exists a large difference between massless and massive sqcd . at large @xmath55 ,",
    "the significant mass - effects exist both for non - susy and susy qcd .",
    "the sqcd case is seen to be much suppressed at large @xmath55 compared to the qcd .",
    "in this talk we discussed the heavy particle mass effects for the virtual photon structure functions which are calculable by perturbative qcd ( sqcd ) . here",
    "we are particularly interested in evaluation of unpolarized and polarized structure functions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with the heavy particle mass effects .",
    "we first discussed our basic framework of studying heavy quark mass effects for @xmath0 .",
    "we then present the analysis of the polarized photon structure function @xmath1 in two aspects ; qcd sum rule of the first moment which is related to the axial anomaly as well as a the @xmath55 dependence of the structure function .",
    "we have shown that the heavy particle decouples from the qcd sum rule .",
    "the analysis shows that the large @xmath55 region of @xmath51 is suppressed in the presence of the heavy quark effects .",
    "we also investigated the photon structure functions in supersymmetric qcd .",
    "experimental confrontation in the future is anticipated .",
