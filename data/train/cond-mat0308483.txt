    "as is well known , there are many physical systems whose phase diagrams exhibit a lifshitz point.@xcite a lifshitz point is a multicritical point at which a disordered , a homogeneous ordered , and a modulated ordered phase meet .",
    "it divides the critical line that separates the disordered phase from the two ordered ones into two sections , and marks the onset of a wave - vector instability . in the case of an @xmath3-axial lifshitz point this instability occurs in an @xmath3-dimensional subspace of @xmath4 .",
    "prominent examples of systems with uniaxial ( @xmath16 ) lifshitz points are , on the experimental side , the metallic compound@xcite mnp , and on the theoretical side , the three - dimensional axial next - nearest - neighbor ising ( annni ) model.@xcite    although the notion of a lifshitz point was introduced decades ago,@xcite the successful application of modern field theory tools to the study of critical behavior at such points is a fairly recent development.@xcite a full two - loop renormalization group analysis and @xmath14 expansion of all critical exponents to second order in @xmath14 about the upper critical dimension @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) has been accomplished for general values of @xmath3 only two years ago.@xcite    in the present paper we wish to study the effects of surfaces on the critical behavior at an @xmath3-axial lifshitz point .",
    "previous work on this problem is scarce .",
    "it started in 1986 with gumbs investigation @xcite based on landau theory .",
    "this was reconsidered , completed , and partly corrected by binder and frisch.@xcite in either one of these papers , only the uniaxial case @xmath16 was considered , and the special axis along which ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interactions compete was chosen perpendicular to the surface plane . the complementary case in which the special axis of the considered semi - infinite annni model is parallel to the surface was dealt with on the level of mean field theory in subsequent work by frisch _",
    "et al_.@xcite even more recently , pleimling@xcite presented results of monte carlo simulations of semi - infinite annni models for both types of surface orientations .",
    "a characteristic feature of critical behavior at lifshitz points is _ anisotropic scale invariance_. let @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote displacements along the corresponding euclidean axes and suppose that the @xmath25 are rescaled by a factor @xmath26 .",
    "anisotropic scale invariance means that the @xmath21 must be rescaled by a nontrivial power @xmath27 in order that the system looks self - similar on different scales.@xcite    an obvious consequence of this property is that two distinct cases of surface orientations must be distinguished when dealing with surface critical behavior at bulk lifshitz points : a parallel one for which the surface normal @xmath28 is along a @xmath29-direction ( all @xmath30-directions being parallel to the surface plane ) , and a perpendicular one for which @xmath28 is along an @xmath30-direction .",
    "since the distance @xmath31 from the surface scales differently in these two cases , one expects ( i ) that the respective values of the surface exponents are in general different , even in mean - field theory , and ( ii ) that the boundary terms which must be included in the hamiltonian are different as well . expectation ( i )",
    "is borne out by both the mean - field results of refs .   and as well as by pleimling s monte carlo results;@xcite ( ii ) turns out to be equally true.@xcite    in this paper@xcite we will focus our attention on the case of _ parallel _ surface orientation , leaving the study of the other , `` perpendicular '' case to a subsequent paper [ which will confirm the above conclusion ( ii ) ] . to our knowledge ,",
    "experimental investigations of even bulk critical behavior at lifshitz points@xcite have so far been restricted to the uniaxial case @xmath16 , and this is also still the only one for which monte carlo simulation results on surface critical behavior at bulk lifshitz points are available.@xcite    although @xmath16 thus appears to be the case of greatest interest , we will keep the value of @xmath3 as general as possible , imposing at this stage no restriction other than the obvious one @xmath32.@xcite just as in essentially all renormalization group ( rg ) analyses of bulk critical behavior with @xmath33 , we will make , however , the simplifying assumption that the wave - vector instability is _ isotropic _ in the @xmath3-dimensional subspace of @xmath30 directions .",
    "let us nevertheless add a cautionary remark about this presumed `` @xmath3-isotropy '' . in a recent study of bulk critical behavior,@xcite",
    "this assumption has been relaxed by requiring only invariance in this subspace under the cubic , or even a lower , symmetry group .",
    "the results indicate that the isotropic bulk fixed point for @xmath34 gets destabilized by bulk terms of second order in @xmath2 and fourth order in the derivatives @xmath35 , although the associated crossover exponent appears to be fairly small .",
    "the inclusion of such non - isotropic terms is beyond the scope of the present work and , of course , meaningless in the uniaxial case @xmath16 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we specify the hamiltonian representing the corresponding universality classes for surface critical behavior at @xmath3-axial bulk lifshitz points .",
    "we explain which boundary terms must be included in it and give the implied boundary conditions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ren ] we first clarify the renormalization of the model for general values of its parameters and derive the resulting rg equations . on the basis of two - loop results , we then discuss the form of the rg flow in the space of the surface interaction constants and identify the fixed points describing the ordinary , special , and extraordinary transitions .",
    "section  [ sec : rgot ] deals specifically with the ordinary transition .",
    "we show that the rg analysis can be simplified in much the same way as in the @xmath36 case of a critical point@xcite by choosing dirichlet boundary conditions , considering correlation functions involving the normal derivative of the order parameter at the boundary , and making use of the boundary operator expansion .",
