    "the mean - field ( mf ) approach to the weakly interacting bose gas ( bg ) is a well established theoretical tool @xcite .",

    "the situation is most dramatic in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case , where the size of the fluctuation region , @xmath1 , is almost insensitive to the smallness of interaction @xcite ( @xmath2 ) : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the critical temperature , @xmath5 is the particle mass , and @xmath6 is the effective long - wavelength interaction constant .",
    "the regime of weak interaction corresponds to a small dimensionless parameter @xmath7 which close to the transition point is equivalent to the condition @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the particle density ) .",
    "for the purposes of the present paper the microscopic origin of the effective interaction @xmath6 is not important .",
    "however , to make connection between our results and realistic experimental systems we briefly review how @xmath6 relates to the interatomic interaction potential @xmath10 .",
    "the value of @xmath6 corresponds to the pair vertex ( the sum of ladder diagrams ) with typical external momenta @xmath11 .",
    "it can be written in a generic form as @xmath12 where microscopic parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend on the case .",

    "there is , however , a very important point about the fluctuation region of a weakly interacting bg : in the limit of small @xmath6 all @xmath0 models  quantum or classical , continuous or discrete  allow a universal description @xcite .",
    "this observation follows from a simple fact that interactions are important only for long - wavelength components of the order parameter field , @xmath37 , with momenta @xmath38 , and in this limit the effective hamiltonian is given by the @xmath39 model @xmath40= \\int \\left\\ {   { 1 \\over 2m}|\\nabla \\psi|^2 + { u \\over 2 }    \\label{psi4}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the effective chemical potential .",
    "the microscopic physics of the model is important only at much higher momenta , @xmath42 , where the system behavior is ideal ( in linear in @xmath6 approximation ) and thus may be easily accounted for analytically .",
    "this observation was successfully used in refs .",
    "( both in 3d and 2d ) in the study of the critical point dependence on interaction .",
    "same considerations apply , though , not only to the critical point itself , but to the whole fluctuation region around it , and one thus expects that , e.g. , the superfluid density dependence on density , @xmath43 , or chemical potential , @xmath44 , is also universal close to the transition point and into the region where the mf theory takes over .",
    "the study of this universal behavior is the subject of this paper .",
    "we found that even for very weak interaction , say , @xmath45 , the conventional mf theory result @xmath46 may not be used since the fluctuation region is still of order @xmath4 itself .",
