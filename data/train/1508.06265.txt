    "given a nested sequence of adaptively generated simplicial meshes @xmath10 with associated finite element spaces @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , the corresponding discrete eigenvalue problem is : find @xmath13 such that @xmath14 and @xmath15 we seek to approximate an eigenvalue cluster @xmath16 and associated invariant subspace @xmath17 .",

    "the corresponding discrete sets are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "afem for eigenvalues are typically based on the standard loop @xmath24 to the finite element error , afem employs local error indicators @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a standard residual error indicator for the residual @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be a given parameter .",
    "@xmath29 is used in to select a smallest set @xmath30 satisfying the drfler ( bulk ) @xcite criterion @xmath31    proofs of convergence and optimality of afem for approximating have been given in several papers .",
    "the first proof of optimality of afem for controlling simple eigenvalues and eigenfunctions was given in @xcite .",
    "other papers concerning convergence of afem for simple eigenvalues include @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite contains a proof of optimal convergence of standard afem for an eigenvalue with multiplicity greater than one , while @xcite proves a similar result for clustered eigenvalues .",
    "these papers mirror afem convergence theory for source problems ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in that they first prove that the afem contracts at each step .",
    "an optimal convergence rate dependent on membership of the eigenfunctions in suitable approximation classes is then obtained by standard methods .",
    "all require that the maximum mesh diameter in the initial mesh be sufficiently small to suitably resolve the nonlinearity of the problem .",
    "the behavior of afem for eigenvalues in the pre - asymptotic regime was studied in @xcite , where the authors proved plain convergence results ( with no rates ) starting from any initial mesh .",
    "these results guarantee convergence of afem for general elliptic eigenproblems to some eigenpair , but not generically to the correct pair .    the works of dai et al . @xcite and gallistl @xcite are most relevant to ours .",
    "in @xcite the authors establish convergence of an afem for a multiple eigenvalue of a symmetric second - order linear elliptic operator for arbitrary - degree finite element spaces .",
    "approximation of eigenclusters of the laplacian using piecewise linear elements is considered in @xcite . .",
    "this leaves open the question of convergence results for afem for eigenvalue clusters using lagrange spaces of arbitrary polynomial degree .",
    "we fill this gap by showing that standard afem for eigenvalue clusters using polynomials of arbitrary degree also converge optimally . while we consider only conforming simplicial meshes , we also provide a key step in extending such analysis to quadrilateral elements of any degree , meshes with hanging nodes , and discontinuous galerkin methods ; cf .",

    "the analysis of @xcite additionally does not immediately apply in the case of non - constant diffusion coefficients .",

    "we briefly explain the difficulty which we resolve . a key step in standard afem convergence proofs establishing a certain continuity between error indicators on adjacent mesh levels . in the case of multiple or clustered eigenvalues ,",
    "the ordering and alignment of the discrete eigenfunctions may change between mesh levels even on fine meshes .",
    "thus @xmath32 and @xmath33 may not approximate the same eigenpair , making the comparison between @xmath34 and @xmath35 used in standard afem convergence proofs irrelevant .",
    "a critical contribution was made in @xcite , where this problem was circumvented by first analyzing a theoretical ( non - computable ) afem based on error indicators @xmath36 aligned to the _ fixed _ continuous cluster .",

    "is used to show that the corresponding afem are essentially equivalent .",
    "we provide ( lemma  [ lem : main ] ) a more direct proof of the equivalence between @xmath37 and @xmath52 which is valid for finite element spaces of arbitrary degree .",
    "extension of the afem convergence results for eigenvalue clusters of @xcite to higher - degree finite element spaces is then immediate ( see theorem  [ t : opt ] and corollary  [ c : opt ] ) .",

    "as numerical experiments confirm (  [ sec : numerics ] ) , this improvement is important from a practical standpoint as it establishes that no knowledge of cluster properties is needed in order to choose @xmath58 correctly",

    "the remainder of the note is structured as follows . in  [ sec : prelims ] we give further assumptions and preliminaries . in  [ sec : main_result ] we prove our main result and briefly sketch its application in the proof of afem convergence for eigenvalue clusters .",
    "a brief set of numerical experiments in  [ sec : numerics ] illustrates our theoretical results .",
    "finally note that we do not give a full proof of eigenvalue convergence , as most of the analysis of @xcite holds verbatim for higher - order elements given the equivalence of the theoretical and practical error estimators .",
    "we also largely employ the notation of that work .",
    "familiarity with @xcite is thus essential to the reader .",

    "let @xmath87 be the energy norm .",
    "the computable error estimator @xmath88 reliably controls up to higher - order terms which can be proved to be negligible under the assumption that @xmath89 is sufficiently small .",
    "the theoretical local indicator @xmath50 is given by @xmath90 a slight modification of proposition 4.1 of @xcite shows that @xmath91 also bounds @xmath92 up to higher - order terms which are negligible if @xmath93 is sufficiently small . in @xcite the volume term is simplified to @xmath94 due to the use of piecewise linear finite element spaces , and the definition in the higher - order case is left open with our choice given as one possibility ( cf .",
    "remark 9 ( f ) of @xcite ) .",
    "our definition of @xmath37 also differs from that given in @xcite .",
    "proofs of optimal convergence rates for adaptive fem require assumptions on the eigenspaces and their resolution by the initial mesh .",
    "first , the continuous eigencluster must be separated from the remainder of the spectrum , i.e. , @xmath95 ( here we take @xmath96 ) .",
    "in addition , the discrete cluster respects this separation in that @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "let then @xmath99 .",
    "the implied requirement on the initial mesh may be more or less strict depending on the separation of the cluster from the remainder of the spectrum .",
    "reliability of our a posteriori estimators is only guaranteed for sufficiently fine initial mesh @xmath61 .",
    "we have for example from proposition 4.1 of @xcite that latexmath:[\\ ] ]    we now define the vectors @xmath108 $ ] , @xmath109 $ ] , @xmath110 $ ] , and . here",
    "these quantities vary with @xmath112 ( for @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) or @xmath115 lying on the mesh skeleton ( for @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) , but this fact has little significance for the time being .",

    "the relationships may now be written @xmath121 let @xmath122 denote the operator @xmath123-norm and @xmath124 the euclidean length .",
    "the proof of lemma [ lem : main ] is thus reduced to showing that @xmath125 under the stated hypotheses .",
    "we now employ several basic facts from linear algebra . letting @xmath126",

    "a short computation shows that @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "a standard result from linear algebra is that @xmath132 and @xmath133 are isospectral for square @xmath134 , so @xmath135 is isospectral with @xmath129",
    ". therefore we have that @xmath136 , and both quantities are equal to the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath135 .",
    "the matrix @xmath135 was analyzed extensively in the proof of lemma 5.1 of @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath135 is nonsingular under the condition , and by ( 5.2 ) and following of @xcite , we have @xmath137 gershgorin s theorem thus gives that the eigenvalues @xmath138 of @xmath135 satisfy @xmath139 thus @xmath140 , which is the first inequality in .",
    "the invertibility of @xmath135 guarantees the invertibility of @xmath141 .",
    "computing as above yields @xmath142 .",
    "because @xmath135 is positive and diagonalizable , we have from that @xmath143 , thus completing the proof of the second inequality in .     in @xcite",
    "it is shown for piecewise linear elements that under the assumption , @xmath144 the first bound in holds with no restriction on @xmath93 .",
    "our proof thus yields an improved cluster - independent bound under the fineness assumption .",
    "also gives an improved bound for @xmath52 in terms of @xmath37 .",
    "significantly loosening the restriction appears to be substantially more difficult .",
    "@xmath141 is invertible for @xmath145 , but the obtained upper bound for @xmath146 degenerates as @xmath147 .",
    "the condition @xmath148 is not substantially weaker than , and control over the equivalency constants is lost as @xmath147 , so we retain from @xcite .    in lemma 3.3 of @xcite it is shown that if @xmath149 and @xmath150 is of arbitrary polynomial degree , @xmath151 where @xmath152 as @xmath153 and @xmath154 is similar to @xmath37 . in our analysis",
    "the obtained bounds are independent of @xmath55 and the double sum term on the right is completely absent .",
    "the absence of the double sum term on the right is important , as ; cf .",

    ", our equivalence analysis extends immediately to the general case .",
    "we consider only @xmath157 , @xmath158 because analyzing optimality in the general case involves consideration of data oscillation , which would make our presentation much more involved ; cf @xcite .",
    "let given lemma [ lem : main ] , the analysis of @xcite mostly holds verbatim for higher - order finite element spaces .",
    "in particular , the following counterpart to theorem 3.1 of @xcite holds .",

    "employing this class requires proving equivalence between @xmath167 and @xmath168 , that is , approximation by functions in @xmath165 is equivalent to approximation by gradients of functions in @xmath169 . in @xcite ,",
    "the needed result is obtained by citing @xcite , in which the equivalence is shown up to data oscillation terms .",
    "however , the necessary equivalence has recently been shown to hold on arbitrary meshes without data oscillation terms in @xcite , which could simplify the proof of proposition 3.1 of @xcite .",
    "[ r : theta ] the dependence of @xmath93 and @xmath58 on various quantities is given in detail in @xcite .",
