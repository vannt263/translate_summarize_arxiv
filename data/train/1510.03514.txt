    "the measurements are chosen with eigenvectors as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 $ ] is required . for a detailed comparison ,",
    "we take three different lower bounds into consideration , which include rudnicki - puchala - zyczkowski ( rpz ) direct sum majorization bound @xcite , simply constructed bound ( scb ) and the recent generalized maassen - uffink ( mu ) bound figured out by liu , mu and fan ( lmf ) @xcite .",
    "see methods for details .",
    "the electron spin of nv center is initialized with a 532  nm laser pulse .",
    "projection measurements with three sets of eigenvectors are used to ensure the initial state of nv spin , then the measurement entropy of each set of eigenvectors is determined .",
    "mw pulses of various length , frequencies and phases as shown in table i , are employed to carry out the projection .",
    "a rabi oscillation signal is used to read out the result after a projection .",

    "the difference between the theoretic prediction and experiment result may be attributed to decoherence of electron spin during the controls and measurements .",
    "since the measured state is initially prepared as a pure state , decoherence will increase the von neumann of the measured state and enhance the sum of entropic uncertainties .",
    "these analyzes can be also manifested by the lower bounds of entropic uncertainty relations discussed in the methods .",

    "4b , we have experimentally investigated entropic uncertainty relations for multiple measurements with different measured states of spin-1 electron spin of a nv center and different kinds of three observables .",
    "differing from ordinary used optical systems , our system is a truly three - level system and has overcome the defects of post - selection .",
    "the significance of physics for multiple measurements is that the uncertainty principle can be more precisely formulated and demonstrated for a high - dimension quantum state .",
    "differring from the well - studied nonlocality , entanglement or other quantumness of correlations , the uncertainty relations are due to the superposition principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "thus the demanding for physical implementation is that it should be an indivisible quantum system .",
    "our experiment system is naturally three - dimension , and our experimental results confirm the theoretical expectation from the uncertainty relations .",
    "our result may shed new light on the differences between quantum and classical physics in higher - dimension .",
