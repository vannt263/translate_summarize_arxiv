    "type i x - ray bursts ( xrbs ) ( see @xcite for reviews ) were first explained by @xcite who associated the xrbs with thermonuclear runaways on the surface of neutron stars that accrete a mixture of hydrogen and helium from a semi - detached low mass companion star @xcite .    in woosley & taam s",
    "_ thermonuclear flash model _",
    "the impact of the accreting matter fully ionizes the matter and heats it to @xmath1 explaining the persistently observed x - ray emissions .",
    "the accreted matter then undergoes gradual compression as it sinks as new matter continuously piles on top of it . under these atmospheric conditions",
    "the electrons are degenerate , but the nucleons are not . therefore the matter is subject to a thin - shell instability that triggers a thermonuclear runaway @xcite . for accretion rates below roughly one eddington ( @xmath2 ) , the bottom layer of the newly accreted matter becomes unstable after a few hours / days and burns explosively and gives rise to a burst of x - rays as the atmosphere is heated to 1 - 1.5 gk . the sudden release of nuclear binding energy heats the atmosphere rapidly and increases the luminosity within a few seconds after which the luminosity decays exponentially as the atmosphere cools again producing the observational features of a type i x - ray burst @xcite .",
    "these bursts are the most common thermonuclear explosions in the universe , so the indestructable and repeatable lmxbs are useful for indirect conclusions about the behavior of matter under extreme conditions .",
    "x - ray bursts have been explored theoretically by @xcite and stable burning has been explored by @xcite using relatively simple hydrodynamical models to estimate the burning conditions e.g.  a set of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the density , @xmath5 is the temperature , and @xmath6 is a composition array describing the fractional concentration of each isotope . on the other hand",
    "more realistic 1 dimensional models have been constructed by many groups @xcite but they suffered from relatively simple nuclear reaction networks so only recently models have successfully included both aspects @xcite .",
    "the relevant types of reaction sequences in xrbs have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "important are @xmath7)- , @xmath8)- , @xmath9)-reaction rates as well as @xmath10-decay rates between the valley of stability and the proton dripline .",
    "reaction rates must be known up to the end - point of the @xmath11-process @xcite .    in the past serveral attempts",
    "have been made to identify critical reaction rates in x - ray bursts .",
    "it is , however , not possible to directly test the astronomical number of possible perturbations of the thousands of participating reaction rates .",
    "@xcite changed groups of decay rates and narrowed the rates down to several important candidates . @xcite",
    "relied on `` inspired guesses '' and found individual important rates .",
    "recently , @xcite has used a one - zone model and individually varied a large number of reaction rates with the intent of verifying `` one - zone''-candidates with a multi - zone model . using monte carlo methods , @xcite varied random groups of reaction rates and similarly identified the most significant candidates for later verification with multi - zone models .    in this paper",
    ", we use such a full 1d x - ray burst model with a complete nuclear reaction network to answer one of the fundamental questions in this field : what are the nuclear reactions that power x - ray bursts ?",
    "while previous studies have used simplified models to delineate basic types of reaction sequences we can now go the next step and describe the actual nuclear reaction sequences that occur as a function of time and depth during a typical x - ray burst .",
    "because temperature , density , and initial composition vary greatly as a function of depth there is no single reaction flow , but a range of very different sequences that influence each other .",
    "identifying the nuclear reactions that take place in x - ray bursts is a prerequiste for understanding x - ray burst light curve features in terms of the underlying nuclear physics and for determining the nuclear physics uncertainties in x - ray burst model predictions of lightcurves and other observables .",
    "it is also essential to guide experimental and theoretical efforts to address these uncertainties in the future .",
    "cross sections have typically been predicted by global models which in most cases have been fitted to stable nuclei and extrapolated to proton - rich nuclei . in many cases cross sections have also been predicted by nuclear shell model calculations .",
    "however , with upgrades of existing experimental facilities and new facilities many of these reactions are now in range of experiments @xcite .    with a better understanding of the nuclear physics it will also become possible to address potential issues beyond the 1d approximation , such as the interplay of lateral flame propagation and nuclear energy release timescales that can affect the modeling of burst rise times .",
    "in this paper we compute and describe one xrb model using the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 and a proper global accretion rate of @xmath14 .",
    "this choice yields a h / he - ignited xrb corresponding to case ( 1 ) of @xcite where the observational data depends more on the @xmath11-process than is the case for a pure he - ignited xrb ( case ( 2 ) of @xcite ) . the newtonian accretion rate ( observable at infinity ) of @xcite and model _ zm _ of @xcite was @xmath15 ,",
    "so the burst behavior of our model is expected to be similar but have a slightly higher hydrogen content and a slightly lower helium content at the point of ignition resulting in a longer rise time .",
    "this model is calculated using a general relativistic type i x - ray burst simulation code that is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the code couples the general relativistic hydrodynamics code , ` agile ` @xcite , with the nuclear reaction network solver of @xcite .",
    "the code includes radiative , conductive , and convective heat transport as described in @xcite and uses an arbitrarily relativistic and arbitrarily degenerate equation of state .",
    "we calculate the radiative opacities due to thomson scattering and free - free absorption using the analytic formulations of @xcite .",
    "we use the same conductivity formulations for electron scattering on electrons , ions , phonons , and impurities as @xcite .    `",
    "agile ` solves the general relativistic equations in a spherically symmetric geometry on a comoving grid .",
    "the computational domain covers about 7 pressure scale heights and is discretized into 129 log - ratioed grid zones with a column density the relativistic column density is mass of a column above an area : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , so @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the neutron star radius , @xmath20 is the neutron star mass , @xmath4 is the density , @xmath21 is the pressure , and @xmath22 is the surface acceleration of gravity . ]",
    "ranging from @xmath23 g @xmath24 to @xmath25 g @xmath24 .",
    "the computational domain is bounded by a realistic core boundary interface @xcite and a relativistically corrected grey atmosphere @xcite which is integrated numerically out to @xmath26 using a 4th order runge - kutta method for greater accuracy @xcite .",
    "the rp - process is naturally limited once it reaches the @xmath27 region because neutron deficient nuclei in this mass range become @xmath28-unbound .",
    "this terminates the reaction flow via ( @xmath29,@xmath28 ) reactions and forms a snsbte cycle @xcite .",
    "this determines the maximum network size that is needed , unless the alpha unbound nuclei can be circumvented in multiple proton exposures .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the @xmath27 endpoint can be reached if burst peak temperatures and hydrogen concentration at ignition are high .",
    "however , @xcite showed , that these ignition conditions are only fulfilled for the first burst after the start of accretion on a pure @xmath30 atmosphere .",
    "compositional inertia effects @xcite for subsequent bursts significantly reduce peak temperature and the amount of hydrogen at ignition as ignition occurs at a lower pressure and depth thus limiting the rp - process to @xmath31 with only a fraction of heavier isotopes produced .",
    "the nuclear reaction network used in this work employs 304 isotopes ( see table  [ [ fig : sunet ] ] ) .",
    "all the connecting particle reactions are taken from the reaclib ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these reaction rates have also been used in @xcite .",
    "the network includes all isotopes between the valley of stability and the proton dripline up to @xmath32 . here isotopes with @xmath33-half lives @xmath34 day are considered `` stable '' on the timescale of the burst intervals , so their daughters are not included .",
    "the hot proton - proton chains of @xcite are also included . above the @xmath32 waiting point , only isotopes between the proton drip line and half lives less than 1 minute are included .",
    "this is because protons only capture on these high - z isotopes during the burst s peak temperature which is only sustained for a few seconds .",
    "weak rates up to @xmath35 are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since only a small fraction of material is processed above @xmath35 , it is a reasonable approximation to ignore neutrino losses from heavier isotopes @xcite .",
    "these considerations significantly reduce the size of the networkm which decreases the simulation run - time .",
    ".the table shows the list of isotopes which describes the @xmath11-process .",
    "see the main text for details",
    ". an earlier version of this reaction network has been used in the following works @xcite but it now includes the hot proton - proton chains of @xcite .",
    "the network is described in more detail in @xcite . [ cols=\">,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the inner boundary , i.e.  towards the neutron star crust , has been slightly improved compared to previous work which used either a massive substrate ( @xcite ) or parameter values ( @xcite ) .",
    "this work uses the neutron star core code of @xcite which calculates the thermal luminosity emanating from the crust given the temperature at the atmosphere - ocean interface .",
    "the code includes pair , photo , and plasmon neutrino emission .",
    "this neutrino luminosity is only a few percent of the thermal luminosity but still several orders of magnitude larger than the hydrodynamical uncertainty due to the conservative formulation of mechanical equations .",
    "different types of convection occur when thermal fluctuations cause instabilities to grow .",
    "their rate of growth determine the eddy - velocity , so all instabilities can be treated by the mixing length theory ( mlt ) implementation .",
    "the present work only includes the schwarzschild - ledoux instability , because it is the dominant form of convection during the burst ( which is the only period relevant to this paper ) , whereas secular instabilities ( e.g.  semi - convection ) occur in between bursts and are negligible at high accretion rates , because the diffusion speed is smaller than the advection speed of the accretion .",
    "the initial model was computed by running the simulation for hundreds of bursts until the burst ashes had advected completely to the bottom of the model and the computational envelope was in thermal balance with the neutron star core model . at this point ,",
    "the envelope was considered to be self - consistent , that is , independent of any possibly unphysical initial values , and a typical x - ray burst was picked for analysis .",
    "[ fig : lt ] shows the luminosity for the analyzed burst as a function of time .",
    "when comparing it to observations , it should be kept in mind that our model assumes a spherical symmetric ignition whereas in reality ignition most likely happens at a single point on the neutron star after which the flamefront spreads and eventually covers the entire neutron star .",
    "therefore fig .",
    "[ fig : lt ] may be thought of as the luminosity of a single point under the assumption of negligible lateral heat transport . however , this assumption seems to provide a good comparisson to reality @xcite .",
    "the luminosity is the combined product of the energy released from nuclear reactions at different depths .",
    "the kippenhahn diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : kippenhahn ] shows the specific nuclear energy release rate as a function of column density and time as well as the extent of the convective zone .",
    "the ignition region is easily indentified as a sudden and rapid increase increase in nuclear energy generation .",
    "this causes a temperature spike that causes a convective instability . since convection transports heat very efficiently , the zones above the ignition point also ignite .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kippenhahn ] .",
    "however , this heat transport quickly restores the shallower radiative / conductive temperature gradient and convection quickly ends .",
    "the kippenhahn diagram also demonstrates how nuclear energy generation decreases as fuel depletes and how residual helium from the previous burst contributes to nuclear reactions below the ignition region .",
    "still , most of the nuclear energy is released , not at the point of ignition but in the hydrogen rich layers immediately above the ignition region .",
    "runaways occurring in a mixed h / he layer mainly proceed via the @xmath11-process ( @xcite ) , where the characteristic timescale , @xmath36 , is given by the sum of the half - lives of the @xmath10-decays in the reaction flow ( @xcite ) . however , depending on the flow pattern , a simultaneuosly occurring @xmath37-process , which does not depend on @xmath10-decays , may decrease the timescale through the @xmath38-shell nuclei ( @xcite ) . as the runaway lasts several seconds for a h",
    "/ he - ignited xrb , the temperature gradient only produces a minor convective instability .",
    "the analysis of a one - dimensional x - ray burst model is very complex , as the model is characterized by rapidly changing temperature conditions and nuclear reaction sequences in each layer .",
    "all these effects are tightly interconnected through energy generation and heat transport by radiation and convection .",
    "since the different layers interact and also burn differently due to different compositions and temperature , the burst can not be understood based on the burning of one layer only , but must be analyzed for several different burning layers . therefore the analysis is split into four regions : the region around the ignition point , the convective region , the surface , and the ocean , which are sufficiently different to merit separate attention .",
    "these regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhot ] which shows a trace of the burst conditions for different depths ( pressures ) during a complete revolution of the limit cycle .    following the cooling of the previous burst ,",
    "the individual layers reach their lowest temperature and highest density of the cycle .",
    "the subsequent accretion increases the hydrogen content of the layer , which in turn lowers the density , because the increased electron abundance of hydrogen requires less mass to maintain the hydrostatic pressure ( @xcite ) compared to the heavier and more neutron - rich ashes ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is most clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhot ] just above the ignition region , which decreases its density by about a factor two during the quiescent phase , as the electron - rich surface ashes of the previous burst sink into this region . for an accretion rate of @xmath14 and a recurrence time of @xmath39 ,",
    "the neutron star accretes a mass of @xmath40 @xmath41 in between bursts .",
    "this means that matter above @xmath42 is freshly accreted , whereas matter below comprise the old surface ashes of the previous burst(s ) , therefore the composition in the ignition region actually consist of heavier ashes with a comparably lower hydrogen / helium abundance .",
    "when the matter ignites and the nuclear runaway causes a rising temperature , it eventually affects the degeneracy of the electrons and decreases the density further so the trace runs up the left leg of the cycle in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhot ] until the fuel is exhausted as it burns into heavier ashes shortly after the peak temperature is reached .",
    "the @xmath33-decays during and subsequent to the @xmath11-process decrease the electron abundance and bring the trace down the right leg as the envelope cools .",
    "therefore the separation in density between the rising leg and the decaying leg accounts for the change in composition , so the largest change happens around the ignition regions , whereas the surface does not change its composition much .",
    "the different compositions and hydrostatic pressures with corresponding temperatures and densities of the burning regions change dynamically on a nuclear timescale defined as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the abundance of the @xmath45th isotope .",
    "therefore the analysis of the nuclear reaction flow proceeds in a different way compared to previous works , which assumed solar abundances burning at fixed densities and temperatures and described the integrated flow over many minutes ( @xcite ) ; instead the instant flow rate is described as the thermodynamic state variables change .    the net reaction flow rate from isotope @xmath45 to isotope @xmath46",
    "is defined by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the time rate - of - change of the abundance of the @xmath45th isotope resulting from all reactions converting isotope @xmath45 to isotope @xmath46 .",
    "the flow - rates for the different times of fig .",
    "[ fig : rhot ] will be demonstrated in the flowcharts of the following sections , which describe the reaction flow rates at the ignition point , the region above it , the convective zone , the surface ( of our model ) , and the ashes going into the ocean .    in these figures",
    "the main reaction - flow is described by the heavy lines .",
    "very thick lines indicate @xmath49-equilibrium .",
    "thin lines indicate a flow rate just above @xmath50 increasing their thickness logarithmically to a maximum after which they stay constant . also shown",
    "are the mass fractions , @xmath51 , for a given mass , @xmath52 , as a function of mass number .",
    "if @xmath53 for any @xmath52 , the bar is cut off and replaced with a dotted line .",
    "this only happens for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 cases where the concentration can be read in the figure caption .      between bursts ,",
    "the surface ashes from the previous burst sink down under the weight of the newly accreting matter while the hot cno cycle transforms hydrogen into helium .",
    "the hot cno cycle is beta - limited and therefore burns at a fixed rate that mainly depends on the concentration of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is partially moderated by a quiescent breakout via the @xmath58 reaction which depletes @xmath57 and thus slows down the conversion of hydrogen into helium .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:87chart971 ] , the reaction flow can subsequently return to the hot cno cycle via the bi - cycle @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 which speeds up the conversion of hydrogen to helium and thus influences the composition for the runaway .",
    "this cycle is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the hot cno cycle increases the @xmath67 concentration until a runaway of the extremely temperature sensitive triple - alpha reaction ensues and causes a spike in the nuclear energy release rate .",
    "the triple - alpha reaction creates @xmath68c which immediately captures two protons to become @xmath56 , causing the fraction of @xmath56 ( @xmath69s ) to increase as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : xt_ignition ] , since @xmath56 ( @xmath69s ) decays too slowly .    meanwhile the increasing temperature of the nascent nuclear runaway leads to a breakout of the hot cno cycle into the @xmath11-process .",
    "the details are described in the following subsections .",
    "we now describe the reaction flow in terms of temperature , density , and proton and alpha fractions as the time develops .",
    "the time is synchronized , so @xmath70 coincides with the peak surface luminosity .      at this time",
    "the increasing temperature has caused the flow rate of @xmath58 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this rate ) to reach @xmath76 of the @xmath77 rate establishing a breakout of the hot cno cycle ( the @xmath78 limit was breached at @xmath79 ) which extends into the light iron region .    at this point",
    "proton captures establish a flow out of @xmath80 .",
    "the matter in this flow can no longer return to the hot cno cycle and the reaction flow proceeds with @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 , where it is blocked by photodisintegration , because of the @xmath84-equilibrium .",

    "the characteristic time depends on the mass fraction weighed harmonic mean of the half lives of the beta decays along respective pathways .",
    "as the temperature rises , the proton capture branches become initially more dominant but then decrease again as photodisintegration of the weakly proton bound and short lived proton - rich @xmath107 and @xmath108 isotopes steers the flow away from the dripline again . yet at this particular temperature the beta decay path of @xmath93 dominates the proton capture to @xmath109 .    from this point ,",

    "the @xmath119-value of proton capture on @xmath117 is only @xmath120 which makes @xmath121 subject to photodisintegration at higher temperatures . at later times",
    ", this can have a large effect on the observed luminosity of the burst @xcite .    here , the proton capture still dominates , so the flow proceeds via @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124",

    "later when the @xmath37-process ignites and the temperature increases , the reaction flow will move closer to the dripline decreasing the @xmath10-half - lives , thus making the timescales comparable . at that point , our model is no longer fully predictive of hydrodynamically influenced ( extensive ) observables such as the time - dependent luminosity .",

    "this means that @xmath477 is not generated in quantity which corroborates previous multi - zone simulations of @xcite .",
    "the average mass of the ashes is @xmath478 @xcite . at the same time",
    "carbon is slowly destroyed by helium captures below the ignition zone and at the top of the ocean .",
    "this corroborates the findings of @xcite and it does not favor the parameter space requirements of current superburst theories @xcite",
    ". however , our model did not consider sedimentation effects which may change this conclusion @xcite .    we find that the convective region does not hit the top of our model for mixed hydrogen / helium ( sub - eddington ) bursters .",
    "therefore we predict that any spectral lines observed during such bursts are not from material that was burned at any significant depth .",
    "however , at lower accretion rates , the convective region does hit the top of our model for helium bursters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the main result of our calculations is the identification of the nuclear reaction sequences that power type i x - ray bursts . in particular , we describe the complete nuclear reaction flow as a function of time and depth , including branchings and waiting points , as it evolves with realistic , rapidly changing temperatures and densities . clearly , the reaction sequences are more complex than previously assumed based on the analysis of much simpler models .",
    "our work is a necessary first step towards identifying the critical nuclear reaction rates in x - ray bursts that have the largest impact on observables such as light curves , or , indirectly , the composition of the ashes .",
    "one can then also begin to disentangle the effects of nuclear burning on the luminosity @xcite from geometric effects such as the propagation of the burning front around the ns @xcite to better explain the many different and somewhat inconsistent shapes of the burst luminosity profiles .",
