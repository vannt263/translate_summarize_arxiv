    "the spring  mass system is a common and easy to perform experiment often used to introduce the study of simple harmonic motions during the first academic year of graduation in physics @xcite .    although the experimental apparatus is simple , an actual spring ",
    "mass system behaves as a simple harmonic oscillator only under specific conditions : ( i ) the mass of the spring must be negligible compared to the attached mass ; ( ii ) the spring elongation caused by the attached mass must exceed the spring equilibrium length by one - fourth @xcite ; and ( iii ) the initial spring stretch must be strictly vertical .    if these conditions are not satisfied , the resulting motion of the attached mass will not be a simple harmonic one .",
    "it will pass from a vertical to a horizontal oscillation in an apparently random manner , exhibiting parametric rather than harmonic oscillations @xcite .",
    "a parametric oscillator is a harmonic oscillator that has at least one parameter oscillating over time . in the spring ",
    "mass system , the pendular motion of the mass modulates the component of the gravitational force , acting along the axis of the spring ( fig . [ forze - moti ] ) .",

    "the amplitude of the spring oscillation decreases while the amplitude of pendular oscillation increases , and vice versa . there is a coupling between the spring and pendulum oscillations , which is at a maximum when the spring oscillation motion s frequency is double that of the pendular swinging motion .    using standard symbols , where @xmath0 is the oscillating spring s frequency and @xmath1 is the oscillation pendulum s frequency",
    ", we can express the frequency ratio ( fr ) between the two frequencies as : @xmath2 this is called _",
    "resonance condition_. the strong coupling between the two modes induces parametric instability .",
    "this instability is observed within an fr interval around the resonance frequency , with a complete mode exchange near to the center and a partial mode exchange outside of it .",
    "the resonance width depends on the degree of motion disorder .",
    "that is , the amplitude of the spurious motions ( mass wobbling , the transverse vibration of the spring , and the rotation around the spring axis ) which are unavoidable in an actual system .    in a laboratory context in which students are allowed to choose and set - up their own experimental apparatus using different springs and masses ( which we call _ open lab _ ) , students can reach particular configurations which are close to the one in which the proper oscillation of the spring elongation and the pendulum oscillation have a ratio not far from two .",
    "students have to approach the spring ",
    "mass experiment with an open mind , dealing with the gap between theory and practice , examining complex multi - effect motions , and mastering experimental techniques .",
    "moreover , they have to handle data statistically and purge the experiment of many nuisances .",
    "it requires students to develop the ability to manage unexpected experimental observations and perform research - like investigation activities in order to interpret the observed motions .",
    "in fact , the analysis of phenomena ( which are not fully understood in advance ) requires the development of strategies for identifying the motion components , and separating their inter - relations so as to treat each component separately .",
    "afterwards , these components can be combined in order to understand the overall motion .",
    "the experimental apparatus was kept as simple as possible : a spring and a weight oscillating vertically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ setup ] .     experimental set - up : sonars ( ultrasonic motion detectors ) detect the motion .",

    "the first coil of the spring is fixed to the top rod.,width=188 ]    the @xmath3 and @xmath4 coordinates of the hanging mass , defined in relation to its equilibrium position , are tracked respectively by a ultrasonic motion detector located underneath ( sonar1 ) and two side ones ( sonar2 and sonar3 ) .",
    "the bob of the mass - spring system is composed of a stack of 20 g metal disks placed on a support to which plasticine may be added in order to obtain the precise desired weight . below the support",
    ", there is a 70 mm diameter diskette which optimally reflects the sound waves emitted by the sonar underneath .",
    "this expedient is necessary because the mass has wide lateral oscillations and wobbles around its pivot .",
    "another spurious motion can be observed , namely the transverse spring vibration which is due to the mass wobbling .",
    "the diskette diameter is a compromise between a larger size for ideal sonar detection , and a smaller size to minimize both friction and spurious motion .",
    "these haphazard motions , superimposed on the bouncing and pendular oscillations , cause the observed motion waveforms to be irregular .",
    "distorted waveforms prevent us from attempting a simple analysis of the experiment and its physics . to minimize spurious motion , it is essential to start with a mass displacement which is smooth and precise , and to use small oscillation amplitudes .",
    "outline of the sound wave paths between the sonars and the appended mass along their trajectories .",
    "the convex , concave and lissajous trajectories represent the motion configurations of the parametric system.,width=283 ]    sonar1 and sonar2 mainly detect the motions in front of them ( vertical and transverse ) , but they also faintly detect longitudinal motions ( transverse and vertical respectively ) because of the different distances between the sonar and the mass .",
    "sonar1 also partially detects transverse pendular oscillation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ view - sonars - moti ] .",
    "similarly , sonar2 partially detects vertical spring oscillation .",
    "in particular , sonar2 detects the vertical oscillation amplitude with a reduction factor of more than ten ( hence negligible ) , while sonar1 detects transverse pendular oscillation with a reduction factor of only about three .",

    "the top coil of the spring is fixed to the bar to partially constrain the rotation of the pendulum oscillation plane .",

    "_ note_. the apparatus planned for the class experiment uses only sonar1 .",
    "students do not elaborate on the complex motion seen during detection .",
    "the spring  mass experiment in the first year of an undergraduate course is intended to introduce students to the physics of harmonic oscillation .",
    "the classical harmonic motion is represented by the following equation @xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the initial oscillation amplitude , @xmath10 is the damping constant , c the damping coefficient , and @xmath11    in these equations , the mass of the spring is assumed to be zero , which is not true in an actual apparatus .",
    "the damping force is assumed to be proportional to velocity , although air friction against a moving object depends on its shape , and it is not linear with velocity .",
    "the experimental investigation involves the following steps : ( a ) testing hooke s law @xmath12 , ( b ) testing @xmath13 , ( c ) measuring the damping time @xmath14 , and ( d ) testing the sinusoidal solution .    in an ordinary lab ,",
    "this experiment is carried out by guiding students to choose heavy masses aimed at obtaining harmonic oscillations . in the context of the open lab approach ,",
    "students set - up their own experimental apparatus by choosing springs and masses which leads to some of the oscillators having very irregular motions .",
    "hence , the new phenomenon of parametric oscillations comes to the fore . in the class discussion",
    ", students understand that the system exhibits the expected harmonic behavior only with heavy masses .",
    "the experiment is initially carried out by studying harmonic oscillations with heavy masses , while investigation of the irregular motion is addressed at the end .",
    "the testing of hooke s law @xmath12 is performed by measuring spring elongations relative to different masses .",
    "the testing of the physical law @xmath18 is conducted by measuring the periods @xmath19 relative to different masses .",
    "the range of masses that can be used can not , however , exceed certain values - they can not be too large in order to avoid damage to the spring , and they can not be too little in order to avoid disordered system vibrations",
    ". the law can be rewritten in terms of the measured quantities @xmath20",
    "@xmath21    a graph of the attached masses versus @xmath22 shows the anticipated straight line , but with a small negative intercept on the @xmath23-axis . the class discussion led to the conclusion that the mass of the spring must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "an effective mass , @xmath24 , operates in the system where @xmath25 is the contribution of the mass of the spring .",
    "hence , eq . [ emme ] must be rewritten as @xmath26 the @xmath23-intercept of the data graph shows the expected value of one - third of the total spring ",
    "mass ( @xmath27 ) , as reported in the literature @xcite . for the remainder of this paper , system mass ( @xmath28 ) refers to the effective mass as defined above .",
    "while students noticed that lighter masses caused more complex oscillations , they also realized that the system did not behave as a simple harmonic oscillator , and therefore questioned the teacher for an effective explanation .",
    "they were advised to delay investigating the non - harmonic motion until the final step of the lab work .    at this point",
    ", the students measured the decay time @xmath29 , that is , the time interval between the beginning of the oscillation and the moment when the amplitude is reduced to @xmath30 of its initial value .",
    "the students , looking for reasonably stable oscillations , used large masses in this measurement .",
    "the expected mass dependence @xmath31 was confirmed .",
    "however , the results were scattered .",
    "the class discussion on the scattered results led to the conclusion that the decay was dependent on the oscillation amplitude @xcite .",
    "the study of the motion was carried out , from now on , by detecting waveforms and extracting the frequency @xmath16 and the decay time @xmath17 from the waveforms .",
    "the waveforms detected by sonar1 were displayed on the computer screen .",

    "subsequently , the fast fourier transform is applied . in this context",
    ", students are introduced to the concept and use of the fft .    the value of the waveform s decay time @xmath17 is obtained by measuring the time interval from the beginning of the oscillation @xmath9 to the @xmath32 point . after the class discussion , students realized that measuring @xmath17 could be done by investigating any section of the curve .",
    "however , different curve sections provide different @xmath17 values @xcite .",
    "indeed , the decay time turns out to be non - exponential soon after the beginning of the curve and becomes much longer along the curve .",
    "this indicates that the damping coefficient decreases as the oscillation amplitudes decrease ; that is , the effect of air friction ( against the disk holding the mass ) decreases as velocity decreases . as a result , the mathematical form of eq .",
    "[ z(t)-freemotion ] , based on a constant decay value , does not reproduce actual , observed motion .",
    "once the mandatory testing and measuring of the harmonic motion characteristics were completed , students looked at the waveforms that were obtained with the use of lighter masses .",
    "the complex motion instability which displayed an interchange between the vertical and transverse oscillations made it clear that a new physical model was needed to account for the unexpected behavior .",
    "the system set - ups , using masses which ranged from heavy ( 70 g ) to light ( 40 g ) , generated waveforms ranging from decaying exponential sinewaves ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ damped - oscill ] ) to partially modulated decaying sinewaves , to fully modulated ( multi - lobed ) decaying sinewaves .",
    "a detailed analysis of the motion is presented in the remainder of this paper .",
    "this result leads us to conclude that there are two different classes of motion : harmonic and non - harmonic .",
    "the two types of motions refer to different physical phenomena : a harmonic oscillator and an unstable parametric oscillator .",
    "the class discussion introduced students to the basics of the subject of parametric instability .",
    "in order to perform a systematic study of the parametric behavior of a spring  mass system , we have investigated the motion at many frequency ratio ( fr ) values distributed within the resonance curve centered around @xmath33 . at each fr configuration , the set of excitations reported in table [ excitations ] were applied .",
    ".[excitations ] a set of excitations turning the system in motion . in the acronym vse / vle+s excitation , the term _ seed _ ,",

[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the objective of this study was to find the width of the resonance curve , and thus the efficiency of the parametric generation at different positions within the resonance curve , the threshold of the instability onset , and the dependence of the parametric process on the kind of excitation .",
    "+ when applying a proper excitation , the system ( when out of resonance ) exhibits an exchange of energy from the spring mode to the pendular mode .",
    "this observation suggests an analogy between this behavior and the parametric generation in non - linear optics , as described next .",
    "equations describing the mode exchange presented in the literature @xcite had to be revisited in order to obtain good simulations with the experimental waveforms . in fig .",

    "the typical actual motion had a rotation angle @xmath38 of about 0.1 rad and a spring elongation @xmath47 of 3 cm , which corresponded to roughly @xmath48 .",
    "these rotation and elongation values were applied in the experiment in order to overcome the effect of the spurious motions .",
    "the approximation of small angle and small elongation is not applicable in an actual system .",
    "however , it is useful for a physics investigation looking at approximate equations . applying the following approximations ,    @xmath49    @xmath50    we get the approximate final equations of motion :",
    "@xmath51    it is evident from the coupling coefficients that the expected motion is very complex , and therefore difficult to predict .",
    "since these motion equations show that the modes are not coupled at the lowest order , the onset of the instability at resonance is expected after a certain excitation intensity .",
    "what happens in the region around resonance is a matter for investigation . from the non - linear down- and up - conversion picture",
    ", we should instead expect no threshold for frequency generation when a seed is injected into the non - linear system .",
    "we should expect a transition time before the onset of a steady state . in ref.@xcite , for an ideal system , it is reported that at the start of the growing solution , there is a phase arrangement time up to the settlement of @xmath52 radians of the relative phase between the two modes .    eqs .",
    "[ eq1-parametric ] and [ eq2-parametric ] are solved numerically and then converted from polar to cartesian coordinates for a comparison between the simulations and the experiments results .",
    "an ad hoc friction term is added into the equation to reproduce the actual friction effect .",
    "in the vertical spring  mass system , the pendulum s oscillation modulates the spring s elongation ( via the term @xmath53 ) and , conversely , the spring s oscillation modulates the pendulum s length .",
    "these two modes are coupled when their frequencies are within a certain interval ( the resonance interval ) , whereas they are de - coupled when the two frequencies are out of resonance .",

    "it is used in the optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) laser scheme to provide a tunable source of coherent radiation , and also in a non - linear converting crystal , that is , a non - linear crystal crossed by the three waves @xcite .    while transferring energy from one mode to another , the spring ",

    "these two parameters determine the pendulum and spring frequencies respectively .",
    "the ratio between these two frequencies , fr , is the fundamental system parameter .",
    "a system s behavior depends on its configuration and on the applied excitation .",
    "the systematic experimental investigation of the parametric behavior requires the identification of a set of relevant configurations and the application of the set of different excitations in table [ excitations ] to each configuration .",
    "a large excitation will drive the system into strong non - linearity , while a small excitation will drive it to a relatively low non - linearity . in order to investigate how the variation of the non - linear coupling changes the system s motion , small and large spring elongations and small and large pendulum shifts ( vse , vle , tse , tle ) were applied .",
    "on the basis of an analogy with non - linear optics , the concept of the input signal amplification by a pump wave was transferred to this system by applying a very small transverse shift ( which we call _ seed _ ) in addition to the vertical excitation ( vse+s and vle+s ) .",

    "[ sonar1-pendolo ] , reproducing so the shape of the waveforms observed with the naked eye . incidentally , the simulation helps to deal with this case .",
    "the motion with vle excitation , compared to the previous vse excitation , is more disordered , the waveforms are more irregular , the mode exchange is faster , the resonance width is wider , and the spectra have additional lines and more pronounced idler lines .",
    "the increase of the non - linearity explains both the faster mode exchange and the wider resonance width , the latter leading to a more pronounced idler frequency @xmath60 line .",
    "in fact , the observed mode exchange extends up to fr=1.6 ( i.e. 80 g mass ) .",
    "the additional frequencies present in the spectra are due to both the harmonics of large pendulum oscillation and entangled spring oscillation , and to the non - negligible spurious motions .",

    ". this merits consideration .",
    "this frequency shift moves further away from the resonant value fr , thus it can be said that the system moves further from resonance , while the observed parametric action is stronger .",
    "the two facts can coexist because the resonance width becomes larger .",
    "this result seems to indicate a reduction in the average value of the pendulum length .",
    "this is possible with a convex arch trajectory .      in line with the idea that the system can behave as a frequency converter",
    ", a very small transverse shift was added to the vertical spring stretching . from this point of view , the non - linear interaction is the mechanism providing the energy transfer from pump to seed . in this case , there is still a resonance condition among the frequencies .",
    "it does not come from the mechanical system parameters , but from its capability of setting itself at the resonant condition of matched periodic motions .",
    "the following experimental results support the conjecture : ( i ) the mode coupling extends itself to heavier masses , see the noticeable waveform1 modulation relative to the system configuration with fr=1.78 ( 60 g mass ) and the modulation even at a fr=1.6 ( 80 g mass ) configuration as shown in fig .",
    "11 ; ( ii ) the complete mode exchange extends up to fr=1.84 ; ( iii ) the system chooses a convex arc trajectory ; and finally , ( iv ) the idler frequency line is neat",

    "the evident waveforms modulation indicates the energy exchange between the two modes.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    the start of the amplified oscillation is neat .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the initial relative phase between the two modes is @xmath52 , as was theoretically calculated in ref .",
    "the setting of an initial @xmath71 causes the onset of the exchange between the two modes , as predicted by the coupling term rhs of eqs .",
    "[ eq1-parametric ] and [ eq2-parametric ] .",
    "transverse excitation is intrinsically different from vertical excitation because the pendulum oscillation of the mass generates an oscillation of the gravitational force on the spring ( by the term @xmath72 ) , and this in turn generates a vertical mass oscillation . in short ,",
    "this excitation couples the two modes directly , and the mode exchange becomes inherent in the system .",
    "this fact leads to experimental results with neat waveforms and relative onsets , and also to neat spectra showing a clear idler frequency line .",
    "overall , the system behavior is similar to the previous one with vertical excitation , although some differences can be observed .",
    "the resonance width obtained is a little larger , the pendular oscillation does not transfer completely to the vertical oscillation even at resonance , and the 2@xmath64 line in spectrum1 is so strong that it becomes comparable to the @xmath63 line .",
    "the presence of the @xmath63 and 2@xmath64 frequencies in the vertical motion spectrum indicates that the system arranges itself into such a motion configuration as to allows mode coupling , i.e. a configuration in which the periods of the two vertical and transverse oscillations are close to resonance .",
    "in fact , the frequencies of the two oscillations move with respect to previous values .",
    "a vertical spring  mass system can oscillate both vertically and laterally .",
    "the two motions are non - linearly coupled . when its parameters , viz . , length , spring constant and mass , lead to oscillation frequencies in resonance , the motion is composed of sideways swinging and vertical spring oscillation , and the two oscillations interchange with each other . the spring ",
    "mass system exhibits a mechanical peculiarity : it is possible for mass trajectories to be found all around the space delimited by the concave and convex arcs .",
    "mostly , concave and convex trajectories are observed , but a type of simile lissajous curve is also sometimes seen .",
    "the motion trajectory depends on the kind of excitation .",
    "these trajectories are also traced by motion simulations with different excitations .",
    "the following main features are observed : ( 1 ) _ strong mode exchange _ ; ( 2 ) _ large resonance width _ ; ( 3 ) _ pendular and spring oscillation frequencies covering a certain interval _ ; and finally ( 4 ) _ settlement of the mass trajectory within a concave - convex arc space_. the increase in the vertical stretching increases both the resonance width and the velocity of the mode exchange ; the spring frequency @xmath0 is transformed into the pendulum frequency @xmath1 plus the idler frequency @xmath60 satisfying the relation @xmath73 ; these three frequencies vary by a few hundredths of a digit in repeated tests .",
    "all these measured and observed features lead us to conjecture that the non - linear system adapts itself to a mechanical configuration suitable for mode interaction .",
    "the ability of the system to end up with configurations with a frequency ratio fr inside the resonance curve width depends on the fact that the amplitudes of the two oscillations and the spring elongations ( thus the two motion frequencies ) adapt themselves for the exchange between the two motions .",
    "in other words , the mass trajectory can arrange itself within a wide space and , in addition , with different shapes .",
    "the oscillation frequencies of the two motions are entrained by the parametric action , the frequency of the pendular oscillation follows the string elongation , and the frequency of the spring oscillation is in turn dragged by the oscillation of the gravitational force component .",
    "this aspect of the motion conformation to the parametric interaction is also supported by the observation of many lines in the waveform spectra relative to complex trajectories .",
    "it can be inferred that the system accomplishes the adaptation of the oscillation periods by developing motion harmonics . for completeness",
    ", it could be added that the idea that the spurious motions present in the actual spring ",
    "mass system foster the parametric behavior .",
    "the system adaptability to different motion configurations plus the fact that the pendulum motion causes a variation in the spring elongation by the appended mass ( i.e. energy is exchanged between the two modes independently of the spring and pendulum frequency ratio ) supports the view of the system as a parametric converter .",
    "the parametric non - linear interaction between the two spring and swinging oscillations can be modeled in the same way as a three - wave non - linear parametric interaction in a plasma or a non - linear crystal . in this model",
    ", the input pump wave is converted into the output up- or down - wave and a third wave , called the idler wave . within this framework , we can associate the vertical oscillation to the pump wave and the small side shift to the seed used for the frequency conversion .",
    "the motion equations developed for this systematic study of the parametric behavior of the spring  mass system largely reproduce all of the experimental observations .",
    "they proved very useful in analyzing the many sophisticated aspects of the complex motion .",
    "the system is used to study harmonic oscillator physics in a first - year laboratory course . in a laboratory organized so that students can assemble their own apparatus as they see fit ( picking components from a pile ) , the spring ",
    "mass system is not likely to reproduce ideal harmonic motion .",
    "there is a high probability that they will set - up a system which shows complex dynamics .",
