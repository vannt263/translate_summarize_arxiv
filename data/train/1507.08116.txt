    "the improvement of the techniques for cooling atoms has been boosting advances in physics for several years  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable example is the finding of experimental evidences of the so - called efimov states , that were predicted by v. efimov in the seventies  @xcite . using few - body techniques",
    ", he showed that the energy levels of three identical bosons accumulate with a geometrical separation between them when the binding energy of the pairs goes to zero .",
    "more than thirty years passed until a signature of such states was found in loss experiments in 2006  @xcite .",
    "although being a true breakthrough , this was still an indirect measurement and another nine years were necessary until this effect was found in a direct manner in experiments with @xmath1he  @xcite .",
    "this impressive technological advance also opened new avenues as the quasi-2d realization of single - species systems  @xcite , two - component gases  @xcite , mixed - species systems  @xcite and even heteronuclear diatomic molecules  @xcite in ultracold atomic traps . on the theoretical side",
    ", it has been shown that three - identical weakly attractive bosons in 2d have only one two - body and two three - body bound states  @xcite and further studies have also shown that the efimov effect does not happen when the system is restricted to lower dimensions  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have focused on mixed - species two - dimensional systems  @xcite , which , despite of not supporting the efimov states , can have a rich energy spectrum in the case of highly mass - imbalanced systems  @xcite .",
    "while most of these calculations were done in vacuum or disregarding the medium , bound states can be drastically affected depending on the surrounding medium in which the system is immersed .",
    "if one thinks about a single impurity immersed in a bath of different atoms , its motion distorts the medium , which in turn acts back on the impurity .",
    "the final state depends on the interaction strength between the different species , where for weak enough attraction the impurity behaves as a free particle and for strong enough attraction it forms a bound state with a particle from the sea . on the other hand , for intermediate attraction the impurity",
    "is dressed by the particles from the sea and becomes a polaron , namely , a quasi - particle whose basic properties as effective mass and charge differs from the ones of the original impurity .",
    "these different properties result from the dressing of the impurity by excitations of the background medium .",
    "the original idea of polaron dates back to landau  @xcite and a discussion about it in the context of ultracold atomic gases can be found in  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to simulate polaronic systems with cold atomic gases by mixing a few atoms of a specific type to a bath of atoms of a different kind  @xcite ( different masses or spin states , for example ) even when the system is restricted to two dimensions and the majority atoms are fermions , in which case the quasi - particle is known as a fermi polaron .",
    "fermi gases have been successfully trapped to quasi-2d geometries and the fermi polaron was already observed through radio - frequency spectroscopy techniques  @xcite .",
    "the fate of a single impurity immersed in a two - dimensional fermi sea has been studied in recent years both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite , where the importance of the particle - hole fluctuations in 2d systems was emphasized .    in real systems",
    "it can be very hard to have only a single particle propagating in the medium and it is therefore important to understand how the presence of extra impurities affect the system . in this work",
    "we take a first step in this direction and consider the case of two identical impurities immersed in a fermi sea .",
    "the study applies to a broad range of masses and both for interacting and non - interacting impurities . in both cases",
    ", the two impurities can attach to a fermion from the sea and form three - body bound states .",
    "we show how the energy of the states are shifted depending on the fermi momentum @xmath0 and also how these states decay into the two- and three - body continuum .",
    "the corrections due to the fluctuations in the sea are considered when the impurities are not allowed to interact with each other .",
    "we show that in spite of the strong influence both the two- and three - body systems , the corrections from fluctuations in the fermi sea have small influence on the point where the three - body bound state cease to exist .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the influence of the background environment in the state of an impurity bound to a fermion from the sea is discussed in sec .",

    "corrections to the three - body states induced by the fluctuations in the sea are discussed in sec .",

    "the two - body energies corresponding to bound states are described by the expression @xmath31 which tends to the energy of the pair in vacuum when the fermi sea is not relevant , i.e. , @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",

    "the absence of bound states in the region defined by ( [ eq11 ] ) was already pointed out in  @xcite and can also be seen in  @xcite for the spin - balanced system and the remaining question is to know what happens to the state in this region .",
    "it is shown in figure  [ bound - virtual - continuation ] that for @xmath34 the state touches the lowest threshold ( @xmath37 ) in two points , strongly suggesting that it enters through the two - body cut in one point and comes back in another one .",
    "this cut is determined exclusively by the square - root inside the logarithm in ( [ eq06 ] ) and the logarithm itself does not contribute to the cut since its argument is positive and non - zero throughout the regions where @xmath38 and @xmath30 for @xmath26 .",
    "the analytic continuation of the matrix elements ( [ eq06 ] ) is labeled @xmath39 and found by flipping the sign in front of the square - root inside the logarithm in ( [ eq06 ] ) , since the logarithm itself does not contribute to the cut .",
    "next , this expression is used to calculate @xmath14 as a solution of @xmath40 , which gives precisely ( [ eq10 ] ) as the result .",
    "notice that now the solution still satisfies condition @xmath28 , but only satisfies condition @xmath27 in the region given in ( [ eq11 ] ) and not outside this region as before .",
    "these two - body states have entered through the cut and are in the second energy - sheet , therefore they are virtual states . these states are shown in figure  [ bound - virtual ] .",
    "the matrix elements of the two - body t - matrix as given in ( [ eq06 ] ) may lead to inconsistent results in the scattering region ( @xmath41 ) , where the imaginary part of the energy becomes important .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath42 in ( [ eq06 ] ) , expanding the terms inside the square root and collecting energies and @xmath43 s together makes it possible to see that the imaginary part becomes null in some cases .",

    "figures  [ fig09a ] and [ fig09c ] have been obtained in  @xcite and in order to straightforwardly compare figure  [ spectral - mol ] to the previous work , calculations here were made replacing the binding energy in and by the total two - body energy measured in terms of the fermi energy @xmath64 plus the chemical potential of the impurity ( @xmath65 ) , specifically @xmath66 on those equations .",
    "a way of taking into account fluctuations in the background medium is by introducing the self - energy of the impurity , which considers particle - hole excitations on top of the fermi sea .",
    "the full propagator for the self - energy of the impurity relates to the bare one through the dyson equation @xmath67    in the self - consistent way , the transition operator and the self - energy obey a set of non - linear coupled equations .",
    "this problem is handled by solving this set of non - linear coupled equations iteratively , which is equivalent to a ward - luttinger approach  @xcite .",

    "the first - order transition operator is a function of the zero - order self - energy and so on ( see [ sec : ese ] for the details ) .",
    "this procedure leads to the set of coupled equations @xmath68 where @xmath69 is given in ( [ eq08 ] ) , @xmath3 is the mas of the impurity and @xmath5 the mass of the fermion .    the problem of one single impurity on top of a fermi sea has been successfully solved with non - self - consistent methods ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , we found the self - consistent one more suitable to handle in the investigation of the three - body problem of two impurities immersed in a fermi sea , whose results are presented in the following sections .",
    "this choice is supported since the self - consistent method describes well the two - body system when particle - hole fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "for instance , calculations done with the zero - order expression of the self - energy ( [ ts1 ] with @xmath70 ) for @xmath23 reproduce previous results in the literature . using ( [ ts1 ] ) and ( [ ts ] )",
    "we found that the energy of the attractive and repulsive branches of the polaron , which are solutions from @xmath71 $ ] , as well as the weights of the branches ( @xmath72 \\right\\}^{-1}$ ] ) and the polaronic spectral function ( @xmath73^{-1 } $ ] ) are the same as found in  @xcite .    in  @xcite the molecular regime ,",
    "namely the region where the energy of the molecule under the effect of particle - hole fluctuations from the medium ( dressed molecule ) is lower than the polaron one , calculated with non - self - consistent methods happens from large and negative @xmath74 up respectively to -0.97 or -0.95 , above which the polaron energy will always be below the molecular energy .",
    "we define @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the two - dimensional scattering length which fulfills @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the fermi energy .",
    "this transition between regimes is often called polaron - molecule transition and we found a first - order ( @xmath70 in ( [ ts1 ] ) and ( [ ts ] ) ) polaron - molecule transition to occur around @xmath79 , which is below the results obtained with variational  @xcite and diagrammatic monte carlo  @xcite calculations , but is close to the @xmath80 found in the 2d limit of quasi - two - dimensional highly polarized fermi gases  @xcite .",
    "the different behavior found between our method and previous studies in the small window @xmath81  @xcite or @xmath82  @xcite is not important for our purpose of using the self - consistent approach in the three - body calculations .",
    "the actual point of crossing is not the relevant information since experiments  @xcite have shown that the crossing of the energies of the polaron and the molecule as function of @xmath74 happens at a very shallow angle and that the two - body energy spectrum is not affected by the polaron - molecule transition ( see  @xcite for details ) .    in view of that",
    ", it is more important that the model reproduces this transition than the actual point of occurrence . solving ( [ ts1 ] ) and ( [ ts ] ) with @xmath70 we find that the energy spectrum of the polaron and the dressed molecule are very similar to each other and that the crossing between the energies does happen at a shallow angle , as shown in figure  [ fig10 ] . here",
    "a difference between the self - consistent method and the non - self - consistent one can be seem . comparing figure  [ fig10 ] to  @xcite",
    ", we note that the polaronic spectrum is exactly the same , while the spectrum of the dressed molecule has a small quantitative difference .",
    "however , as explained above , since our model captures the correct behavior of the two - body system , this small quantitative difference is not a problem . as an extra argument for using the self - consistent method in our analysis , notice",
    "that our three - body results when particle - hole fluctuations are taken into account lie mostly in @xmath83 ( see figures  [ diagrams ] and [ diagram_corrected ] ) , from where the energy of the polaron is always lower than the molecular one and it is the same as calculated with non - self - consistent methods  @xcite .    .",
    "notice that the crossing between lines happens at a shallow angle and that both spectra are similar in the region @xmath84 , from where the polaron has always a lower energy . ]",
    "it was found in  @xcite , with diagrammatic monte carlo calculation , that corrections beyond one particle - hole in the medium does not contribute significantly to the energy spectrum of the polaron and the dressed molecule . in view of that , the convergence of the iterative solution of ( [ ts1 ] ) and ( [ ts ] ) is studied . @xmath85 and @xmath86 are shown as function of @xmath87 for different @xmath74 s , where the strong binding - limit corresponds large negative @xmath74 and the weak binding - limit to large positive @xmath74 .    results for large binding ( @xmath88 ) are shown in figure  [ sigmatau-2 ] .",
    "notice that the self - energy converges very fast as @xmath89 and @xmath90 are almost indistinguishable from each other and both of them differ just slightly from @xmath91 .",
    "as expected , the self - energy correction is almost negligible in this limit , which is confirmed by noticing that @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are practically identical .",
    "increasing @xmath0 and moving towards the small binding limit , a few iterations are still needed for the self - energy to converge . for @xmath95 , for instance , the difference from @xmath90 to @xmath89 is clearly much smaller than the difference from @xmath89 to @xmath91 , as shown in figure  [ sigmatau+0 ] .",
    "the difference is that now the self - energy influences the two - body system , rendering it more bound .",
    "there is a big difference between the pole position of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , but this difference is already much smaller from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .",
    "the scenario keeps this pattern for @xmath96 and figures showing details are not presented here .",
    "the results in figure  [ sigmatau ] provide our argument for working with @xmath93 and @xmath91 in the three - body calculations below .",
    "the computational cost of going beyond this are considerable and we do not expect neither qualitative nor large quantitative changes .",
    "one great simplification comes by noticing that the function @xmath97 is almost independent of the angles in its argument , namely @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the agreement between the both sides of ( [ sigma - app2 ] ) is in general better than @xmath101 .",

    "furthermore , for @xmath23 and @xmath20 only one bound state is supported  @xcite as shown in figure  [ mequ0 ] . without considering the particle - hole fluctuations in the fermi sea ,",
    "the behavior of the three - body energy and of the thresholds is similar to the case where the impurities are allowed to interact . for @xmath167 , the three - body threshold , which is the highest for @xmath20 , increases at the smallest rate and for @xmath168 it becomes lower than the @xmath21 threshold , meaning that the decay channel @xmath146 is not available any more for the three - body system .",

    "since the last pair is also unbound ( non - interacting impurities ) , the three - body system is bound when the three subsystems are unbound . the behavior of the ground state is similar to what has been seen in so - called borromean systems in 2d  @xcite . in the present case",
    "we have the background medium in the form of a fermi sea which is what makes this behavior possible .",
    "one may therefore consider this an example of a medium - induced borromean state in 2d .",
    "next we introduce the self - energy correction in the three - body equations .",
    "since the two impurities are not interacting , only the second term on the right - hand - side of ( [ eq.021 ] ) survives .",
    "it is important to emphasize at this point that the bosons in our problem are not from a bose gas , but isolated impurities , or we can say that the average distance with a third boson from the gas is very large compared to any size scales in the problem ( vanishing limit of the density ) . in this idealized situation ,",
    "the connected three - body t - matrix can in principle contribute only to the two - boson t - matrix with a term proportional to the fermion density .",
    "if in addition , we take into account that the bose gas density is negligible according to our statement of the physical situation , the contribution of the connected three - body t - matrix to the self - energy will be negligible and only the non - connected term of the t - matrix with the fermion and boson t - matrix will be relevant . indeed , this term was already taken into account in our evaluation of the self - energy of the impurity . in a more general situation , e.g. , in the presence of a bose gas , other contributions to the impurity self - energy",
    "should be included , and the feedback from the full three - body t - matrix should be relevant as the boson density increases . in this case , one has to include corrections to the self - energy beyond the contribution of the disconnected part of the three - body transition matrix .",

    ", the convergence of the two - body t - matrix with @xmath170 is very fast and the most significant correction is seen in figure  [ sigmatau ] to be from @xmath171 to @xmath172 , justifying the choice of @xmath70 in ( [ ts ] ) . in order words , the real gain of going to higher",
    "@xmath170 is not worth the extra time spent in the calculation .",

    "the numerical solution of ( [ fsig ] ) gives the corrected three - body energy and we need to understand again how the thresholds and energies depends on the fermi momentum .",
    "however , since the self - energy correction is being considered , both the two- and three - body corrected thresholds are calculated numerically .    as shown in figure  [ sigmatau ] , the inclusion of the self - energy in the propagator of the impurity renders the molecule more bound , which lowers the @xmath21 threshold in the three - body calculation ( see figure  [ mequ0 ] ) .",
    "the same happens to the three - body threshold , which starts from zero when @xmath20 and goes negative for @xmath174 .",
    "the three - body state is also more bound and its energy as function of @xmath0 increases slower than in the previous cases , where corrections due to fluctuations of the medium were not considered .",
    "the three - body energy and the thresholds with and without the self - energy correction are compared in figure  [ mequ0 ] .",
    "the final result is that , although rendering both the two- and three - body bound states more bound , the inclusion of the self - energy makes the states disappear at a slightly smaller @xmath0 , since the changing rates of the thresholds are strongly affected .",

    "the continuous lines are from calculations without fluctuations in the fermi sea and the discrete points show how the lines move when the self - energy is considered .",
    "notice that the correction is always small within the range of the fermi momentum and masses considered , which covers typically experimentally accessible cold atomic gas systems .",
    "such correction is expected to be smaller in the case of interacting impurities , where the extra attraction would render the effects of the fermi sea less relevant .",

    "we have considered the 2d problem of two identical atomic impurities ( either bosonic or with distinct internal states ) , immersed in a background fermi sea and interacting with a fermion on top of it in 2d .",
    "the interactions were modeled by attractive zero - range potentials and the faddeev decomposition was used to write the homogeneous coupled integral equations for the three - body bound state .",
    "the problem of just one impurity propagating in the fermi sea was first considered and we have reviewed some well - known results in the literature  @xcite , specifically the two - body t - matrix in the medium ( [ eq06 ] ) and the energy of the molecule as function of its total momentum ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "the binding energy of the molecular state was studied previously as a function of its mass ratio , total momentum , and fermi energy . for some values of these parameters",
    "the pole of the t - matrix , which represents a bound state , enters through the cut of the two - body continuum and increasing the momentum of the molecule it returns from the cut and become a bound state again  @xcite .",
    "we have shown here that this state appears in the second energy sheet and becomes a virtual state , as shown in figure  [ bound - virtual ] .",
    "replacing @xmath176 in order to consider the two - body t - matrix in the medium ( [ eq06 ] ) in the scattering region leads to inconsistent results in some cases ( see figure  [ tau ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the analytic extension of these matrix elements , as presented in ( [ eq08 ] ) , gives the right solution in this case .",
    "particle - hole fluctuations were then considered and the self - energy of the impurity propagating in the sea was self - consistently calculated .",
    "the non - linear couped equations for the transition operator and the self - energy ( [ ts1 ] ) and ( [ ts ] ) were solved iteratively and we showed that the convergence of both quantities with the number of iterations was very fast . although this method has some disadvantages , we found it suitable to use mainly in the three - body calculation .",
    "this choice is supported since the self - consistent method employed in this work correctly describes the two - body system when particle - hole fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "we found that the energy of the attractive and repulsive branches of the polaron , as well as their weights and the polaronic spectral function are the same as found in  @xcite .",
    "the polaron energy is the relevant information for @xmath83 , where most of the effects of the medium on the three - body system are calculated ( see figures [ diagrams ] and [ diagram_corrected ] ) .",
    "the formalism used here allowed us to study the complex problem of two interacting impurities propagating in the fermi sea .",
    "interestingly , three - body states of the two interacting impurities and a fermion of the sea are supported even when two of the subsystems are in a virtual state .",
    "importantly , the fate of the three - body state depends strongly on the two - body systems . this feature can be used to identify the three - body states of two impurities immersed in a fermi sea in measurements of cold atoms lost from a trap .",
    "the complexity of the integral equations when the impurities are allowed to interact makes the inclusion of the self - energy correction very hard to be implemented .",
    "however , if the impurities are not interacting , the integral equations simplify and the effect of the correction can be studied .",
    "first of all , the three - body bound states are still allowed when the impurity - fermion subsystems are in a virtual state .",
    "since we have two non - interacting impurities , the three - body systems are bound when the three two - body subsystems are unbound , which can be interpreted as a medium - induced borromean state in 2d .",
    "the fate of the three - body states once more strongly depends on the two - body subsystems .",
    "the inclusion of the self - energy of the impurity drastically affects the behavior of the subsystems and of the three - body states , as it can be seen in figure  [ mequ0 ] , but the superposition of all the effects together leads to just a small correction in the final results , as shown in figure  [ diagram_corrected ] .",
    "we expect that the correction would be smaller in the case of interacting impurities , since the effects of the fermi sea would decrease as there is more attraction in the system .",
    "three - body bound states were also found when a single impurity is immersed in a fermi sea  @xcite .",
    "the different particle can be in a polaronic state or bind one or two fermions from the sea .",
    "it is interesting to understand what scenario is more favorable when another impurity is brought into the game .",
    "would each impurity bind to two fermions or the two impurities bind to one fermion ?",
    "valuable information can also be gained by considering two polarons interacting with each other as a four - body system of two fermions and two impurities , using techniques similar to the ones employed in  @xcite .",
    "another interesting direction for future investigations would be to study how the presence of the fermi sea would affect the momentum distribution of the three - body systems by calculating the measurable two- and three - body contacts through an extension of the techniques described in  @xcite .",
    "another interesting point is the understanding of how the signature of the efimov effect in 3d three - body systems under the influence of a fermi sea  @xcite would disappear and connect to the result presented here through a change in dimensionality , similarly to what was done for three - identical bosons in  @xcite .",
