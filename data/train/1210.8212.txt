    "multi - channel ccd often suffers from a crosstalk phenomenon between readout channels .",
    "there are several user documents describing the crosstalkand some observatories prepare data to correct this crosstalk .",
    "@xcite estimated the effect in dfosc and fors1 at the eso vlt .",
    "the studies for advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in hubble space telescope ( hst ) is also available @xcite .",
    "since the replacement of the ccds in july 2008 with full depleted back illuminated ccds ( fdccd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the data of subaru prime focus camera ( suprime - cam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show crosstalk signatures in a ccd .",
    "the effect is easily recognized in narrowband data with low sky background ( figure [ fig : crosstalk1 ] ) .",
    "as one of the crosstalk dimming regions ( shadows ) has the same spatial parity as the source , it obtains a higher signal - to - noise ratio(s / n ) after coadding ( figure [ fig : manga_crosstalk ] ) , and causes a problem even in a deep field study .    in this paper , we investigated the crosstalk effect in suprime - cam in order to remedy this problem .",
    "we adopted a method using cosmic rays in dark frames , and present a recipe to remedy the crosstalk effects .",
    "suprime - cam is equipped with 10 fdccds , and each fcccd is read out from 4 channels . in this paper , we call the channels cha , chb , chc , and chd along the x - axis of the output fits file for simplicity .",
    "the data from each channel consist of 512@xmath24177 ccd pixels , 8@xmath24177 pixels of the prescan region of serial read and 48@xmath24177 pixels of the overscan region of serial read , followed by ( 8 + 512 + 48)@xmath248 pixels overscan of parallel read .",
    "the fits data have an additional ( 8 + 512 + 48)@xmath248 pixels in the prescan region , but it should not be used for the analysis ( figure [ fig : ccd1ch ] ) .",
    "the 10 ccds are arranged in 2 rows of 5 ccds each .",
    "the ccds in the upper row ( detector id=0,1,2,6,7 ) are read from the top edge ( y=4177 ) , and those in the lower row ( detector id=3,4,5,8,9 ) are read from the bottom edge ( y=1 ) .",
    "when a ccd is read out , the charges stored in each pixel are converted to voltage at on - chip amplifiers(on - chip amps ) at 4 channels .",
    "the conversion factor of the on - chip amps has @xmath015% difference .",
    "suprime - cam is equipped with 40 preamplifiers(preamps ) arranged in 10 quad - channel preamp boards around the camera dewar .",
    "one preamp board handles signals from a ccd .",
    "the gain of the preamp is 3 @xcite and the difference among the 40 preamps is @xmath01% ( nakaya , h. 2012 ; private communication ) .",
    "the signals are then put into the signal board ( sig ) and a correlated double sampling is performed @xcite .",
    "suprime - cam has 5 sig boards , and one sig board has 8 channels .",
    "the signals from ccd0 and ccd1 are into the first sig board , those from ccd2 and ccd3 are into the next , and so on .",
    "the signal is then converted into a digital value .",
    "the analog - to - digital conversion factor is configured to be 1 @xcite , but slightly differs at each channel by @xmath05% .",
    "the total gain of the suprime - cam data is the product of the three gains of the components ; the gain of the analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) in the sig at each channel(@xmath3 ) , the gain of the preamp ( @xmath4 ) , and the gain of the on - chip amp at each channel(@xmath5 ) .",
    "a schematic figure is shown as figure [ fig : manga_readout ] .",
    "the charges in ccds are read out and converted to the digital data simultaneously in 40 channels .",
    "for example , when ( x , y ) of ccd0 is read , ( 1024-x , y ) , ( 1024+x , y ) , and ( 2048-x , y ) of ccds in the upper row and ( x,4178-y ) , ( 1024-x,4178-y ) , ( 1024+x,4178-y ) , and ( 2048-x,4178-y ) of ccds in the lower row are read at the same time .",
    "the apparent crosstalk appears as follows .",
    "when a bright object is observed at ( x , y ) in cha , shadows appear at three symmetric positions of saturated stars ; at ( 1024-x , y ) in chb , at ( 1024+x , y ) in chc , and at ( 2048-x , y ) in chd , which are read out at the same time .",
    "currently , the crosstalk in the same ccd , the pixels read at the same time show an apparent crosstalk .",
    "the possible crosstalk across the ccds , and effect on the adjacent pixels in the same ccd are examined later .    in the three shadows corresponding to ( x , y ) , ( 1024-x , y ) and ( 2048-x , y ) , can be removed by dithering , as their position at the sky changes when the telescope pointing is changed . however , the movement of the shadow at ( 1024+x , y ) is the same as the object at ( x , y ) , and the shadow gains s / n when we coadd the dithered images ( figure [ fig : manga_crosstalk ] right ) , if the shadow is larger than the slight differential shift by the optical distortion at the dithered pointing .",
    "the existence of the shadow of the same parity is different from quadrantic readout devices , such as acs / hst and fors1/vlt .",
    "as investigated in a later section , the shadow of the same parity causes problems in deep field imaging in broadband , though the effect can not be detected in a single exposure .      if the crosstalk occurs around the input of the on - chip amps , the effect would correlate with the raw charge @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the value in output fits file after the bias subtraction .",
    "if the crosstalk occurs between output of the on - chip amps and input of the preamps , the effect would correlate with @xmath6@xmath10 , and if between output of preamps and input of adc , the effect would correlate with @xmath11@xmath3 .",
    "we estimated the relative value of the total gain @xmath12@xmath7@xmath5 and the relative gain of sig+preamps , @xmath12@xmath4 , and listed them in tables [ tab : gain ] and [ tab : siggain ] .",
    "the detail of the estimation is described in the appendix . though we do not have @xmath13 nor @xmath14 data , the difference of @xmath3 and @xmath12@xmath4",
    "is small , since the difference of @xmath4 is only @xmath01% among the 40 preamps .    using the relative gain values , we obtain three different signal values ; @xmath15 , @xmath16@xmath2@xmath10 , and @xmath17@xmath2@xmath7@xmath8 .",
    "@xmath18 is the count in fits file in analog - to - digital unit(adu ) , @xmath13 is proportional to the voltage between the on - chip amps and the sig , and @xmath14 is proportional to the charge in a pixel .",
    "we can evaluate the crosstalk by taking the correlation between pixels in channel x and channel y , when the pixel in x has a large count and the pixel in y has a smaller count .",
    "a linear trend of crosstalk effect was reported by previous studies on other ccds(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . under the assumption that the crosstalk is linear to the source",
    ", the strength of the crosstalk is measured by the coefficient of proportionality .",
    "the coefficient of other instruments are about @xmath0@xmath1 ; acs / hst has -0.6 .. -2.3@xmath19@xcite and fors1/vlt has -2.3 .. -2.5@xmath19@xcite . it should be noted that the readout count suffers from the quantization error , and the difference smaller than 1 adu in a certain pixel is buried in the noise .",
    "since the maximum output is @xmath20 adu in suprime - cam , the crosstalk coefficient is meaningful when its absolute value is larger than @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 .",
    "there are several types of data for measuring the correlation .",
    "@xcite used a calibration lamp with a mask on the focal plane and a night sky with standard stars . @xcite used dark frames and sky frames . in this work ,",
    "we only use dark frames and cosmic rays to minimize the error from flat fielding and the background level estimation .",
    "the small spatial size of the high count pixels in cosmic rays , even smaller than the point spread function ( psf ) , enables us to examine a possible spatial extent of the crosstalk shadow over a pixel .",
    "moreover , the fdccd of suprime - cam and the subaru telescope have several advantages for using cosmic rays in dark frames .",
    "thanks to the thickness of the fdccd ( 250@xmath24 m ) and the high altitude of the subaru telescope , suprime - cam receives a relatively large number of cosmic rays .",
    "the dark current is very low ; less than 0.6 adu per hour , and the readout noise is also low ; 2 - 2.5 adu in rms @xcite .",
    "the acquisition of dark frames does not require either a special instrument setting such as a mask , nor a telescope time at night .",
    "we can take a dark frames in a daytime if we can keep the instrument in the dark .",
    "on the other hand , the drawback of this method is that it is not easy to obtain enough data of high - value count pixels .",
    "for example , we could not investigate the behavior near the full - well region in this study , because of the lack of such data .",
    "we used all dark frames with exptime @xmath25120 seconds taken between 2008/12/03 and 2011/07/02 ( ut ) ; after the fix of the linearity problem , and before the hardware incident of the subaru .",
    "the data are retrieved from mastars and the smoka archives .",
    "the used frames are summarized in table [ tab : darklist ] .",
    "bias is first subtracted using the median of 48 pixels in the serial overscan region at each y. the bias level has a @xmath02 adu waving pattern in x direction as shown in figure [ fig : y - overscan ] . the pattern is common in all the ccds , in all the channels , and in all the exposures as far as we examined in the dark frames .",
    "this pattern is corrected using the data in the parallel overscan region .",
    "the median of the parallel overscan after the subtraction of the serial overscan of the parallel overscan reflects the pattern , and it is subtracted from the data in each frame .",
    "finally , the dark is subtracted , and we call the value after the mean dark subtraction as @xmath18 , hereafter",
    ".    the dark level is estimated by averaging the count in a channel avoiding the pixels which are hit by cosmic rays or are affected by the crosstalk because of a high count in other channels .",
    "the mean dark count is various in different ccds and channels .",
    "the typical count of dark is ( 0.16@xmath260.09 ) adu for 300 second exposure ( ( 5@xmath263)@xmath2@xmath1adu s@xmath27 ) , and the rms is ( 2.2@xmath260.2 ) adu .",
    "the rms includes readout noise and the error of bias / overscan subtraction .",
    "as the total gain of suprime - cam is about 34 electron adu@xmath27 , the mean dark count is less than 1 electron .    in the bias and the dark corrected dark images ,",
    "high count pixels are picked up and then corresponding pixels in other 3 channels in the same ccd are checked .",
    "we arbitrarily adopted the threshold of the `` high '' count as 300 adus in @xmath18 .",
    "total 1277705 pixels are marked as a high count pixel in the 370 frames .",
    "the count of the three corresponding pixels to the high count pixel is cataloged .",
    "when taking the correlation of @xmath28 as the high count and @xmath29 as the affected count , @xmath29 should be corrected the dark count , but @xmath28 should not , since the dark count would also contribute to the crosstalk . however , as we take the @xmath30 as the high count in following analysis , the effect of the dark subtraction of 0.16 adu makes 0.05% error in the coefficient .",
    "the error is negligible , as we estimate the coefficients with 3 significant figures . for simplicity",
    ", we used the bias and the dark subtracted value for @xmath28 instead of the bias subtracted value .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] an example of the correlation is shown .",
    "the data are ccd0 and a high pixel is at chb and the checked the corresponding pixel in chd .",
    "apparent linear correlation is recognized .",
    "the result shows that the shadow appears even in the dark data with negligible ( @xmath31 ) background charges .",
    "it suggests that the crosstalk phenomenon in suprime - cam should be a slight shift of the zero level .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the result by @xcite that the effect is additive and not multiplicative .",
    "we can therefore expect that an additive correction established with these negligible background data is also valid for the object images with sky backgrounds .",
    "we then multiply two kinds of relative gain to @xmath18 .",
    "one is the value multiplied by the sig+preamp gain in table [ tab : siggain ] .",
    "it represents the voltage between the output of the on - chip amp and the input of sig .",
    "we call it @xmath13 .",
    "the other is the value multiplied by the total gain in table [ tab : gain ] , which is proportional to the photo - charges .",
    "we call it @xmath14 .",
    "the question is which is the fundamental variable , @xmath18 , @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "as the gains are different among channels , the behavior of the three variables is different .",
    "a clue is @xmath014% change of gain of the on - chip amp of cha of ccd9 in 2010/10 .",
    "if crosstalk depends on photo - charges ( @xmath14 ) , the coefficient of the crosstalk should change if the gain of on - chip amp(@xmath5 ) changes . if crosstalk does not depend on the gain",
    ", the coefficient should remain the same .",
    "we calculated the regression line using the data before the change of the gain , and tested whether the data after the change follow the same regression line .",
    "for the regression , we estimated the distribution of @xmath9(other ) , especially the fraction of outliers .",
    "the distribution of the pixel values which are not affected by the high count pixels is well approximated by gaussian in @xmath32 , with several ( @xmath0@xmath33 ) outliers on the positive side .",
    "the fraction is much larger than the expected fraction of @xmath34@xmath35 in gaussian , @xmath36 , and possibly due to weak radiation events .",
    "if we exclude @xmath37@xmath35 data in normal distribution , the expected reduced @xmath38 is only @xmath39 smaller .",
    "therefore , we neglect the effect of the truncation as @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "we restricted the data that input of high count pixel is in chd and output is in cha in order to exclude the effect of the difference of the coefficients of different combination of the channels discussed in the next section .",
    "we adopted chd because it has more high count pixels than chb or chc by chance in our data . from likelihood - ratio test with the critical value of 5% , we obtained the result that the regression of @xmath18 and @xmath13 is not significantly different , while the regression of @xmath14 changes significantly after the change of the gain .    as another check ,",
    "we plotted the histogram of @xmath42=@xmath9(other;chd)/@xmath9(high;cha ) in @xmath9(high;cha)@xmath4315000 data of @xmath18 and @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : chip9hist ] .",
    "we can see a shift of the histogram of @xmath14 , while @xmath18 remains the same .",
    "we therefore conclude that the crosstalk affects @xmath18 or @xmath13 , and not @xmath14 .",
    "the result resembles the result by @xcite , who noted that `` changing the gain , e.g. from low to high gain , does not alter the cross - talk amplitudes , when the cross - talk originates from the ccd itself rather than from the adcs electronic circuits . ''",
    "the result implies that the crosstalk does not occur inside of the ccd but downstream of output of the on - chip amp . in the following analyses ,",
    "we do not use @xmath14 . whether @xmath13 is more fundamental than @xmath18 or not can not be distinguished by this ccd9 gain analysis .",
    "as the difference of @xmath18 and @xmath13 is 7% at most as listed in table [ tab : siggain ] , the correction of the crosstalk may have a comparable error if the wrong variable is used .",
    "we investigated the linear correlation of each ccd of each combination of the channels , because we noticed that some combination of channels have weaker crosstalk signal than others .",
    "for example , the chc affected from chb in ccd0 shows weak crosstalk signal as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chbchcplot ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : chbchcexample ] .",
    "ideally , we can estimate all combinations separately by investigating all possible datasets . in our data , however , some combinations do not have enough data at large @xmath9(high ) and the error of the estimation of the coefficient is large .",
    "we therefore set a working hypothesis and test its validity .",
    "the hypothesis is that the coefficient is the same for the same combination in a mirror symmetry .",
    "for simplicity , we will call the data where a high count pixel is in chx and the output is chy as crosstalk of xy , and write it as cxy . from the assumption of the mirror symmetry ,",
    "the combinations are reduced to 4 groups : 4 of cab - like combinations , which include cab , cba , ccd , cdc , 4 of cac - like ones , 2 of cad - like ones , and 2 of cbc - like ones .",
    "we call the groups as gab , gac , gad , and gbc , respectively . as the small @xmath9(high )",
    "data only add the noise , we restricted the fitting range at @xmath9(high)@xmath44 .",
    "we also tested @xmath9(high)@xmath45 but the difference between them is small .",
    "the coefficients of the best - fit regressions are shown in table [ tab : coeff1 ] and [ tab : coeff2 ] .",
    "the 95% confidence intervals are calculated from likelihood - ratio test .",
    "the regression of gab and gac have an overlap of the confidence intervals , while other two do not have the overlap .",
    "then , data of each channel pair are compared with the best - fit function by likelihood - ratio test with the critical value of 5% .",
    "one cbc data ( ccd5 ) and two cbc data ( ccd0 and ccd5 ) are significantly different from the best - fit function both in @xmath18 and @xmath13 . as the total number of combinations",
    "are 120 , the expected number of significantly different pairs should follow binomial distribution bi(120,0.05 ) in an ideal case .",
    "we therefore conclude that the coefficients of the crosstalk are not significantly different in the same symmetry group , and we mix all the chips and the combinations in the same symmetry group hereafter . in future , this hypothesis should be re - examined when more data are available .",
    "as the coefficient of gbc in the same ccd is different from other three , we can assume that the crosstalk may occur around the output of on - chip amp , because the difference of gbc from other three groups exists only inside the ccd package .",
    "this implies that @xmath13 would be the fundamental variable .",
    "we therefore use @xmath13 hereafter .",
    "we checked whether the crosstalk occurs only in the corresponding pixel to the high count pixel .",
    "if the crosstalk has a time duration , not only the pixels which were read at the same time but also the pixels which were read later might be affected .",
    "for example , if ( x , y ) in cha has a high count , ( 1024-(x+@xmath46x),y ) is examined in chb , and also the corresponding pixels in chc and chd .",
    "we should be careful in the analysis that if ( ( x+@xmath46x),y ) in cha is also a high count pixel , the shadow at ( 1024-(x+@xmath46x),y ) would be caused by a normal crosstalk effect from ( ( x+@xmath46x),y ) .",
    "we therefore set an additional constraint that ( ( x+@xmath46x),y ) and corresponding pixels in other three channels should not be high count pixels , i.e. @xmath47300 .",
    "we then found a sign that the confidence intervals of the coefficient are significantly different from 0 at @xmath46x@xmath48 .    for a detailed study",
    ", we select the high count pixels which extend only one pixel along the x - axis , and calculate the profile of the crosstalk coefficients along the x - axis . the result is shown in figure [ fig : xprof_n1 ] , and the coefficients around x=0 are given in table [ tab : xprof_n1 ] .",
    "the errorbars represent the 95% confidence intervals .",
    "the readout sequence is toward + x. the pixel at @xmath46x=1 is read out just after the high count pixel is read out , for example .",
    "the profile of gab , gac , and gad resemble one another . in @xmath46x@xmath49 region ,",
    "the coefficient is @xmath0 0 . at @xmath46x=0 ,",
    "the coefficient is significantly negative .",
    "it is the shadow of the crosstalk in figure [ fig : crosstalk1 ] .",
    "then the coefficient is back to almost 0 at @xmath50 , and then _ significantly _ positive at @xmath51 .",
    "it resembles a damped oscillation pattern . on the other hand",
    ", the profile of gbc shows no significant crosstalk except at x=0 .",
    "if the crosstalk occurs around sig , the crosstalk of ccd(2n ) and ccd(2n+1 ) may occur , as they are handled in the same sig board .",
    "the possibility is examined in the same way as in the previous section .",
    "we picked up a high count pixel and check the corresponding pixels which are read at the same time in other ccds .",
    "none of the coefficients of the crosstalk across the ccds is significantly different from 0 .",
    "if we use all the combinations , the coefficient is @xmath52@xmath1 , and their 95% confidence interval is @xmath53@xmath54@xmath1 .",
    "the result supports the assumption that the crosstalk would occur around on - chip amp . and",
    "the possible small crosstalk across the ccds is negligible , because the crosstalk effect is buried in the quantization noise if the coefficient is smaller than @xmath0@xmath22@xmath23 as discussed in section [ sec : method ] .",
    "we tried to correct the two significant pixels at @xmath55 and @xmath51 using the coefficients in table [ tab : xprof_n1 ] .",
    "the recipe is as follows :    1 .",
    "prepare an overscan subtracted image .",
    "2 .   convert the pixel value ( @xmath18 ) to @xmath13 using the gain in table [ tab : siggain ] .",
    "3 .   visit each pixel in the frame .",
    "when visiting ( x , y ) in cha , calculate the crosstalk effect from ( 1024-x , y ) as @xmath46 x=0 and ( 1024-(x+2),y ) as @xmath46 x=+2 in chb .",
    "the crosstalk from chc and chd are also calculated .",
    "subtract the sum of the effect from the pixel value at ( x , y ) in the output frame .",
    "this procedure is based on several assumptions .",
    "first , we assumed that the effects from different pixels are additive .",
    "the coefficients we use are calculated from isolated signals .",
    "we assumed that the crosstalk effect is a simple sum when several high count pixels are connected in the x - axis .",
    "this assumption is checked later .",
    "second , we assumed that the crosstalk from different channels is also additive .",
    "this must be verified by checking whether the crosstalk signal changes when two or more pixels have high count .",
    "for example , we should check whether the crosstalk in cha is doubled or not if chc and chd are hit by cosmic rays . in current data ,",
    "such events are too few to make a conclusion .",
    "third , we assume that the crosstalk does not affect the pixels in the same channel .",
    "it is difficult to check , since the local change of bias level from @xmath46x=0 can not be distinguished from a change of the gain and the effect would be very small ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath46x=+2 signal might be seen in the same channel , but we can not distinguish the crosstalk signal from the original signal , as the intrinsic profile of the cosmic rays is unknown .",
    "we checked the first assumption , the effects from different pixels are additive , using the crosstalk corrected images following the recipe .",
    "the profile after the correction is shown in fig [ fig : xprof_after ] .",
    "as expected , the crosstalk is corrected well for single high count pixels , and most of the coefficients are consistent with no crosstalk ( @xmath56 ) . however , connected high count pixels show a significant sign that pixels at x=0 in some combination have a significant signal .",
    "this means that the crosstalk phenomenon is not perfectly additive .",
    "recently , @xcite reported that preamp+sig have a remnant signal of @xmath01 adu in following pixels in 4 channels after 50000 adu signal in a channel .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath0@xmath57@xmath23 of the coefficient at @xmath50 in our analysis .",
    "the different behavior of crosstalk after connected high value pixels may be a combined effect of the crosstalk and the remnant signal .",
    "currently , it is difficult to investigate further because of the lack of sufficient data",
    ". detailed investigation on this point will be possible when more data are available in future .      in the previous section",
    ", we get a recipe for the crosstalk correction for data with a negligible background . in this section",
    ", we will test the correction to the data with a background .",
    "we will apply the correction to two kinds of astronomical data .",
    "one is a narrowband image with a bright star .",
    "such data has a low background sky level , and the effect of the crosstalk is apparent in a single image .",
    "the other is a deep field taken with a broadband filter .",
    "it is difficult to recognize the crosstalk in a single image , but the coadd enhances the s / n of the shadow .",
    "then , we will estimate the effect of the crosstalk correction quantitatively .",
    "for the first test , we used h@xmath58(n - a - l659 ) data of m83 of 720 seconds exposures , which were used in @xcite .",
    "after flat - fielding , the background is typically 700  900 adu , and rms is 20  40 adu in a pixel .",
    "saturated stars make blooming of @xmath060000 adu , and the shadow will be @xmath010 adu .",
    "an example is shown in the top pane of fig [ fig : m83 ] .",
    "though the crosstalk signal is 0.2  0.5@xmath59 in a pixel , the corresponding shadow pattern is recognized in a single image , because the blooming pattern has a width of @xmath020 pixels .",
    "the result of the correction is shown in the bottom pane of fig [ fig : m83 ] .",
    "the apparent shadow is corrected by our recipe .",
    "fig [ fig : m83xprof ] is a surface brightness profile in 2 arcsec apertures along x - axis of the two images .",
    "the shadow is corrected well .      for the second test",
    ", we adopted a part of z - band(w - s - z+ ) data of uv4a field .",
    "the exposure time is various between 180 sec to 720 sec .",
    "the median of the sky level is @xmath026000 adu .",
    "the position angle is the same for all the exposures , and the crosstalk shadows of the same parity overlap at the same position .",
    "we performed a standard reduction of suprime - cam .",
    "after the reduction , the shadow is not obvious in a single exposure , because of the high photon noise .",
    "however , it becomes apparent after the coadd of many exposures .",
    "we picked up an example of the shadow as shown in figure [ fig : uv4a ] top - left pane , and the coadd of the corrected data with our recipe is the top - right pane .",
    "then , we divided the data into two subgroups according to the x - position of the dithering so that the celestial position shown in figure [ fig : uv4a ] is affected by the crosstalk in the frames of one of the groups , and not in the frames of the other group .",
    "the numbers of the frames are 68(affected ) and 86(not affected ) .",
    "the result of the coadd of each group is also shown in figure [ fig : uv4a ] bottom - left and bottom - right .",
    "the surface brightness profile of 2 arcsec apertures along the x - axis is shown as figure [ fig : uv4a_prof ] .",
    "it shows that the shadow at x=100 is corrected well by our method ( open circles ) , and the spatial profile of the coadd of the non - affected frames ( filled triangles ) is recovered .",
    "using cosmic rays in dark frames , we evaluated the crosstalk in the new suprime - cam fdccds .",
    "the strength of the crosstalk is not affected by a change of the gain of the on - chip amps , which implies that the crosstalk occurs not inside the ccd but downstream from the output of the on - chip amp .",
    "the crosstalk effect is well approximated by a linear correlation .",
    "the coefficient seems to be correlated with the distance between the on - chip amplifiers in the ccd , which implies that the crosstalk occurs around on - chip amps .",
    "the coefficients are not significantly different among the 10 ccd ccds .",
    "no crosstalk is detected among the different ccds .",
    "we also find that the crosstalk appears not only the corresponding pixels but also at the next pixel but one .",
    "we present a recipe to remedy the crosstalk effect .",
    "the recipe is applied to the real data to show that it works well .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for suggestions which helped us to improve and clarify the manuscript .",
    "we appreciate fumiaki nakata for obtaining dark frames , hidehiko nakaya for the detailed information on readout system of suprime - cam , yukiko kamata and hisanori furusawa for the previous gain measurement of the ccds .",
    "we appreciate yutaka komiyama and satoshi kawanomoto for suggestions and comments on the analysis .",
    "this work is based on archived data collected at the subaru telescope .",
    "the data are obtained from mastars , which is operated by the subaru telescope , and the smoka , which is operated by the astronomy data center , national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "data of suprime - cam has gain information of each channel in fits header .",
    "the values should be @xmath12@xmath7@xmath5 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the gain of the analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) in the sig at each channel , the gain of the preamp of each ccd , and the gain of the on - chip amp at each channel , respectively .",
    "the header values , however , are known to have large error .",
    "the reason was that the preamp and the sig used for the gain measurement were not the same as the currently used ones .",
    "especially , a sig board with one channel was used when the gain was measured .",
    "therefore the gain values in the header represents @xmath60@xmath5 , where @xmath61 is an unknown coefficient of @xmath62@xmath63 .",
    "as the gain of the preamp used for the measurement was @xmath64 while the typical gain of the preamps in the camera is @xmath65 , the factor was corrected in the fits header values .",
    "we can see the incorrect gain problem by multiplying flat images with the gain values in the fits header at each channel .",
    "an example of ccd5 is shown in fig [ fig : newgain ] left .",
    "the flat pattern is the product of the quantum efficiency ( qe ) of each pixel , the throughput pattern of optics , and the inverse of the total gain .",
    "we can expect that the qe would be continuous at the channel boundary within a small variation .",
    "the optics pattern should be smooth .",
    "as there is a level gap between adjacent channels , it must be made by incorrect gain value ratios .",
    "namely , it should reflect the variation of @xmath5 among the channels in the same ccd .    in this study",
    ", we only require the ratio of the gains , since we expect that the crosstalk would be approximated by a linear relation as many other cameras follow .",
    "we therefore recalibrate the gain of each channel using dome flat so that the step between ccds and channels to be minimal . as the gain of one channel ( cha ) of ccd9",
    "is changed in 2010/10 , we need to use a set before the change and after the change .",
    "we adopted 18 exposures of v , r , and i - band taken on 2010 - 06 - 10 for the former , and 38 exposures in v , r , and i - band taken between 2011 - 03 - 31 and 2011 - 04 - 04 for the latter .",
    "each frame is divided by the median of the frame for normalization .",
    "then , the median of the normalized frames is taken for each band and each ccd .",
    "this is a normal dome flat .",
    "we then extracted regions of 128 pixels wide across the channel boundary and binned by 32@xmath232 pixels .",
    "the left 2 binned pixels vl[1],vl[2 ] are in the left channel , and the other two pixels vr[3],vr[4 ] are in the right channel . from vl[1 ] and vl[2 ] , vl[3 ] is estimated by linear extrapolation , and vr[2 ] is estimated from vr[3 ] and vr[4 ] .",
    "the ratio vr[3]/vl[3 ] and vr[2]/vl[2 ] reflect the ratio of the gains of the adjacent channels .",
    "the schematic figure is in figure [ fig : manga_newgain ] . as the y - pixels are 4177 in original flat",
    ", 2@xmath2130 of the ratios are obtained .",
    "the median of the ratio gives the ratio of the gain of the adjacent channels in the ccd , and the error is estimated from median of the absolute deviation ( mad ) .",
    "we found that the ratio is the same within the error ( typically @xmath00.05% ) among different bands and in different epochs , except the cha of ccd9 .",
    "this result supports that this method well extracts the relative gain information , as the flat pattern due to optics differs in different bands .",
    "we therefore took the median of the ratio of gains in all the bands .",
    "except for the cha of ccd9 , the two epochs are mixed to calculate the relative gain .",
    "we then estimated the ratio of the gain between neighboring ccds .",
    "the similar method is adopted but we adopted a binning size of 100@xmath2100 pixels , and ratios not only of x - neighbors but also of y - neighbors are calculated .",
    "the relative position and rotation of ccds were estimated from night sky dithered exposures .",
    "we adopted the positions and the rotations as in table [ tab : position ] .",
    "as the gain ratio information is redundant , we solved the overdetermined constraints by a singular value decomposition method .",
    "the relative gain values are given in table [ tab : gain ] .",
    "the normalization is so that the chb of ccd5 to be unity , for the standard stars are often observed in the channel .",
    "the data reflect the relative values of @xmath12@xmath7@xmath5 .",
    "the application of the new values is shown in fig [ fig : newgain ] right as an example , where the gaps disappear .    dividing the re - calibrated relative gain ( @xmath12@xmath7@xmath5 ) by the gain values in the fits header ( @xmath60@xmath5 ) ,",
    "we can obtain relative gain of sig+preamps , @xmath12@xmath4 .",
    "the values are listed in table [ tab : siggain ] .",
    "the normalization is also at the chb of ccd5 .",
    "the change of the gain of cha of ccd9 in 2010/10 is thought to be the change of the on - chip amp and the gain of sig+preamp remains the same .",
