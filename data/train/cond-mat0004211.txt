    "magnetic field control of the shape of ferromagnetic alloys with martensitic structure was suggested recently @xcite and advantages of using those kind of materials as actuators was substantiated @xcite .",
    "the suggestion was based on the fact that crystallographic anisotropy of martensite lattice encourages the presence of strong magnetic anisotropy .",
    "for example , in ni@xmath0mnga martensite lattice the easy axis of magnetization is directed along the axis of tetragonality ( c - axis ) with the shortest axial length @xcite .",
    "the martensitic crystal consists of mixture of the martensite variants possessing different c - axis orientations .",
    "the increase in the fraction of the martensite variants with c - axis directed along the magnetic field due to the movement of twin boundaries would appear to be more advantageous process in comparison with the process of magnetic moment rotation in the martensitic variants , in which the easy axis of magnetization is non - parallel to the applied magnetic field .",
    "the change of the martensite variants proportions would lead to macroscopic deformation of sample , i.e. to the control of the sample shape by the applied magnetic field .",
    "more than 4 % field - induced strains have been observed in a single - crystal of ni@xmath0mnga alloy @xcite .",
    "it have been shown that the initial state of samples is important for observing such a big effect .",
    "the single martensite variant state was obtained by applying axial compressive stress to martensite crystal @xcite or by cooling the sample through the austenite - to - martensite phase transformation under axial compressive stress @xcite .",
    "magnetic field applied in transverse direction produced more than 4 % macroscopic deformation .",
    "the aim of this work was to confirm the coincidence of martensite c - axis with the axis of easy magnetization in near - stoichiometric ni@xmath0mnga alloys and to investigate the conditions when martensite variants can be redistributed by the applied magnetic field .",
    "two alloys ni@xmath1mn@xmath2ga@xmath3 ( n1 ) and ni@xmath4mn@xmath5ga@xmath6 ( n2 ) were melted in induction furnace in argon atmosphere .",
    "the composition of the alloys was measured by wave - length dispersive spectroscopy ( wds ) .",
    "after homogenization at 1000 @xmath7c during 3 days and aging at 800 @xmath7c 1 day alloys were air cooled to room temperature .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements revealed the heusler type ordered structure ( l2@xmath8 ) for both alloys in austenitic state .",
    "martensitic transformation points m@xmath9 , m@xmath10 , a@xmath11 , a@xmath10 , and curie point t@xmath12 were measured using low field ac magnetic susceptibility technique ( for n1 - m@xmath11=71 @xmath7c m@xmath10=67 @xmath7c a@xmath11=74 @xmath7c a@xmath10=78 @xmath7c t@xmath12=97 @xmath7c , for n2 - m@xmath11=29 @xmath7c m@xmath10=26 @xmath7c a@xmath11=32 @xmath7c a@xmath10=35 @xmath7c t@xmath12=99 @xmath7c ) .",
    "samples for magnetic investigation had been cut by spark cutting machine with dimensions 4x4x4 mm .",
    "the specimens of alloy n1 had a rather fine grain structure , but alloy n2 samples have been cut from one big grain .",
    "all m - h curves were obtained using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) .",
    "the specimen stage was mounted between the pole pieces of a 1 t electromagnet and could be rotated for different field orientations . in all measurements rotation of the samples",
    "was carried out at zero magnetic field .",
    "the mechanical and thermo - mechanical treatment were carried out by compression using tensile machine l1000r with cross head speed of 0.2 mm / min .",
    "stains induced by magnetic field were measured by strain gauges .",
    "temperature was controlled with an alcohol - based circulator .",
    "figure 1 shows the m - h curves at 25 @xmath7c for alloy n1 along the different cubic directions of the sample , marked as a , b and c , before and after 5 % compression .",
    "the model describing the martensite magnetization curves have been proposed recently by likhachev and ullakko @xcite .",
    "discussion of our experimental data is based on this model .",
    "the m - h curves of the sample in three above - mentioned directions before compression tests are shown in fig .",
    "it is clear from the model that c direction of the sample is close to the hard magnetization direction . for two other sample directions",
    "a and b the m - h curves indicate the different volume fractions of martensite variants , in which the easy axis of magnetization is directed along the field .    the m - h curves in fig .",
    "1b show that the 5 % compression of the sample along b direction results in the sample texture , which is very similar to that for the single variant martensite with c - axis , which is indeed the easy axis of magnetization , along the compression direction . along the a and c directions",
    "m - h curves ( see fig .",
    "1b ) reveal the direction of hard magnetization .",
    "the subsequent compression of the sample along direction a leads to the axial texture reorientation of about 90@xmath7 , thus the c - axis and consequently the easy axis of magnetization again coincides with a compression direction ( see fig .",
    "the direction b becomes close to the direction of hard magnetization .",
    "the change of compression direction from b to a and vice versa results in reversible reorientation of the martensitic texture . at the same time c",
    "direction always remains the direction of hard magnetization .",
    "this can be connected with realization of only two martensitic twin variants in studied sample after such a type of mechanical treatment .",
    "uniaxial anisotropic constant estimated from the area between m - h curves for easy and hard axes ( fig .",
    "1b , 1c ) was k@xmath13=0.25 mj / m3 .",
    "this value is close to that obtained by tickle and james @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the m - h curves for the single - crystal sample of alloy n2 without any preliminary treatment .",
    "the dimensions of the sample and the procedure of measurements were the same as in previous case .",
    "the m - h curves measured in a direction are shown in fig .",
    "initial part of magnetization curve ( marked as 1 in fig .",
    "2a ) corresponds to the case where the fraction of the martensite variant with hard axis of magnetization along a direction is dominant ( compare curves in fig . 1 and 2 ) . at the field in the interval 0.3 - 0.5",
    "t magnetization abruptly increases and approaches the saturation level .",
    "when decreasing the field , the magnetization keeps the saturation level towards the lower field .",
    "subsequent magnetization loops have no particularities and show saturation at low field , indicating that the easy axis of magnetization now is directed along the field ( curve 2 on fig .",
    "when sample is rotated by 90@xmath7 from a to b direction along the field , m - h curve again shows the same behavior ( see fig .",
    "the effect is fully reversible - 90@xmath7 rotation of the sample from b to a position and vice versa does not change the peculiarities of m - h curves . consequently",
    ", it is evident that under the influence of the magnetic field within the interval of 0.3 - 0.5 t one can observe the easy axis reorientation from the perpendicular to parallel to the field direction .",
    "it must be pointed out that if the magnetic field is applied along the c direction of the sample , no changes of easy axis direction occurs and c direction always coincides with the hard axis of magnetization .",
    "the above - mentioned reorientation of the easy axis is caused by the redistribution of the martensite variants proportions under the applied magnetic field and would lead to macroscopic deformation of the sample .",
    "the results presented in fig .",
    "3 confirm this conclusion .",
    "3a and fig .",
    "3b show the changes of strain against magnetic field of alloy n2 for the single - crystal and polycrystalline samples , respectively . for the single crystal sample",
    "the strain gauge was attached to the preliminary magnetized sample along a direction coincided with the easy axis of magnetization .",
    "the polycrystalline sample was preliminary thermo - mechanically treated by 5 % compression cycling at the temperature higher than af temperature with subsequent cooling lower m@xmath10 temperature .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements of the cubic structure , made before thermo - mechanical treatment , revealed that preferable orientation along columnar grains was the 001 .",
    "the strain gauge was attached to the polycrystalline sample along the compression direction , which was parallel to the columnar grains .",
    "curves 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "3 show the changes of the strain vs. magnetic field applied across the strain gauge axis .",
    "then the sample was turned by 90@xmath7 at zero field ( b single crystal sample direction is parallel to the magnetic field ) , and subsequently the strain was measured as a function of the magnetic field ( curves 3 and 4 ) . increasing the magnetic field after every 90@xmath7 rotation of the sample results in more than 4 % strain .",
    "the changes of single crystal sample dimensions due to rotation between a and b directions are reversible , but applying the magnetic field along direction c causes no dimension changes .",
    "results shown in fig . 2 and fig . 3a are in a good accordance to each other .",
    "the difference between curves 1 in the figs .",
    "3a and 3b can be connected with that the polycrystalline sample has not been magnetized before measurements .",
    "the rather big sample shape changes give us the possibility to confirm strain gauge data by micrometer measurements . the observed magnetic - field induced",
    "reversible strains are the largest to date obtained for polycrystalline ni@xmath0mnga alloys .",
    "\\1 . compression of ni@xmath0mnga alloy samples by approximately 5 % , at a temperature lover that the m@xmath10 one results in formation of close to one variant martensite structure in which c - axis coincides with compression direction .",
    "it is confirmed that martensite c - axis is the axis of easy magnetization .    \\2 . in single crystal ni@xmath0mnga alloy sample the reversible redistribution of twin variants by applying the magnetic field can be obtained without any preliminary treatment .",
    "the martensite structure reorientation occurs only between two sample directions , the third one remains the axis of hard magnetization .",
    "the rearrangement of the martensite variants under influence of magnetic field is accompanied with reversible changes of sample dimensions exceeding 4 % .",
    "the same effect can be achieved even on polycrystalline samples after appropriate thermo - mechanical treatment ."
