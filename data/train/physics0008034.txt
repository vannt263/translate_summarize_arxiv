    "kek - atf is a test facility to study the low emittance multi - bunch beam and beam instrumentation technique for the future linear collider .",
    "that consists from 1.5 gev s - band linac , a beam transport line , a damping ring , and a diagnostic extraction line .    in the linac ,",
    "the electron beam is generated by a thermionic electron gun .",
    "typical intensity is @xmath1 electron / bunch .",
    "the bunch length shrinks from 1 ns to 10 ps by passing a couple of sub - harmonic bunchers , a tw buncher .",
    "the electron beam is accelerated up to 1.3 gev by 8 of the s - band regular accelerating section .",
    "one section has two accelerating structures driven by a klystron - modulator .",
    "klystron is toshiba e3712 generating 80 mw with a pulse duration of @xmath2 rf .",
    "a peak power of 400 mw with a pulse duration of @xmath3 is obtained by sled cavity and makes a high gradient accelerating field , 30 mev / m .",
    "20 of bunches separated by 2.8 ns are accelerated by one rf pulse .",
    "this multi - bunch method is one of the key technique in the linear collider , but atf is now operated in single - bunch mode because of the kek radiation safety policy .    in april 2000 , we achieved horizontal emittance @xmath4 , vertical emittance@xmath5 ( both for @xmath6 , single bunch mode ) @xcite which are almost our target .",
    "so , our next task is to achieve such low emittance with the high intensity , high reputation multi - bunch electron beam . to start the multi - bunch operation",
    ", we have to clear the radiation safety limit anyhow .",
    "one of the biggest source of the radiation is the beam transport line . the large energy tail and the energy jitter causes the radiation loss in the beam transport line .",
    "to suppress the radiation , we have to stabilize the beam energy and also improve the quality of the beam .",
    "in addition , the energy jitter fluctuates the injection efficiency to the damping ring , the beam intensity becomes therefore very unstable .",
    "the energy stabilization of the linac is very important for the systematic study for the beam instrumentation at the extraction line .",
    "from a study of the energy instability@xcite , one of the biggest source of the instability was klystron voltage jitter induced by the fluctuated modulator output .",
    "we implement a new deq method to compensate it .    in our modulator ,",
    "the pulse forming network , pfn is charged up resonatorly up to 43 kv . by discharging @xmath7 , a pulse transformer gains this voltage up to 340 kv with pulse duration of 7.5 @xmath8 and is fed to the klystron .     and",
    "dv / dt respectively .",
    "even deq works , @xmath9 correlates with dv / dt . , width=188,height=170 ]    deq module controls the voltage of pfn , @xmath9 . when @xmath10 reaches the reference voltage , deq modules fires trigger to stop the charge up .",
    "[ ffoff ] shows the correlation between @xmath9 and gradient of the charge up curve , @xmath11 .",
    "ideally @xmath9 is independent from @xmath11 , but there is a significant correlation .",
    "this correlation is explained as follows ; there is some delay to stop charging up and the delay causes excessive charge up which is expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the delay .",
    "this excess is therefore proportional to dv / dt and induces the correlation .    if dv / dt was always same , it was not a problem .",
    "in fact , the amplitude of ac power is unstable and that makes fluctuated dv / dt .",
    "improving the quality of power source is straightforward , but it will be rather expensive .",
    "then we admit the fluctuation of dv / dt and consider to compensate the @xmath9 jitter .        because dv / dt is fluctuated and @xmath14 could not be zero , then the only way to compensate the fluctuation is to control @xmath14 to keep a constant excessive charge up . fortunately , we can measure dv / dt prior to fire deq signal , then feed - forward control is possible .",
    ".stability of @xmath9 with and without feed - forward control .",
    "the data are shown in % of rms divided by the mean . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ pdspec ]    fig .",
    "[ fbresult ] shows a result of a test for the phase - lock system .",
    "klystron rf phase was stabilized within @xmath15 peak - to - peak by the phase - lock system with the amount of the feed - back up to @xmath16 . accounting for @xmath17 systematic error ,",
    "the klystron rf phase was stabilized within @xmath17 .",
    "the phase - lock system will be introduced for all klystrons soon .",
    "this system will suppress the long range energy drift of the s - band linac .",
    "to suppress the energy instability of the s - band linac , feed - forward control deq was introduced .",
    "the momentum jitter was measured at the beam transport line and was improved from 0.6% to 0.2% by the feed - forward deq . for further improvement , the feed - forward circuit was modified to correct the curve shape of dv / dt-@xmath9 relation by using linearizers ."
