    "intersecting d - brane models provide a framework in which the particle physics aspects of string theory , such as the origin of gauge structures and chiral spectrum , as well as some couplings , have a beautiful geometric interpretation .",
    "in particular the intersecting d6-brane constructions on compact type iia orientifolds @xcite , wrapping three - cycles of the internal orbifold , provide a framework where the explicit conformal field theory techniques in the open string sectors can be employed to determine the gauge structure , the chiral spectrum and ( some ) couplings . within this framework",
    "the chiral matter @xcite is located at the d6-brane intersection points in the internal space .    a large number of non - supersymmetric three family standard - like models have been constructed , based on the original work @xcite ( for a partial list , see @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "these models satisfy the ramond - ramond ( rr ) tadpole cancellation conditions ; however , since the models are non - supersymmetric , there are uncancelled neveu - schwarz - neveu - schwarz ( ns - ns ) tadpoles . in addition , in these toroidal / orbifold constructions",
    "the string scale is close to the planck scale , thus these models typically suffer from the large planck scale corrections at the loop level .    on the other hand ,",
    "the first supersymmetric three family standard - like models with intersecting d6-branes were constructed in  @xcite .",
    "these constructions were based on type iia @xmath7 orientifolds . while stable at the string scale the original constructions possess additional chiral exotics .",
    "( their phenomenological consequences were studied in @xcite . )",
    "subsequent work @xcite revealed more examples of standard - like models , as well as systematic constructions of grand unified georgi - glashow models @xcite . for works on the supersymmetric constructions of standard - like models on other orientifolds , see @xcite .",
    "most recently , in @xcite a systematic search of @xmath1 orientifolds revealed a number of supersymmetric potentially viable three - family standard - like models .",
    "these constructions are based on the pati - salam gauge symmetry .",
    "the subsequent symmetry breaking via d - brane splitting and d - brane recombination gives no additional @xmath8 s near the electroweak scale , in contrast to the previous supersymmetric standard - like model constructions  @xcite which typically possess additional light neutral gauge bosons .",
    "generically these models possess the chiral standard model exotics , which however can be removed from the spectrum due to the hidden sector strongly coupled dynamics @xcite .",
    "[ there is currently strong activity , in constructions of supersymmetric chiral solutions with d - branes of gepner models ; see @xcite and references therein . while there seems to be @xcite a large class of three - family standard - like models with no chiral exotics ,",
    "these exact conformal field theory models are located at the special points in moduli space where the geometric picture is lost , and the couplings , such as yukawa couplings , do not possess hierarchies associated with the size of the internal spaces , such as in the case of the toroidal orbifolds with intersecting d - branes . ]    the main focus of the previous constructions based on intersecting d6-branes on compact orbifold constructions was on obtaining the gauge symmetry and the chiral spectrum of the effective theory at the string scale .",
    "in particular , further study is needed to shed light on the gauge symmetry breaking patterns , both from the point of view of deforming the original string construction , _ i.e. _ , by employing the splitting or recombination of d - branes , and in the dual field theory approach .",
    "the latter involves giving vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) to chiral superfields - moduli , associated with the brane deformation , referred to as higgsing .",
    "the intriguing property of the type iia orientifold constructions with the intersecting d6-branes is that the gauge symmetry breaking patterns have a geometric interpretation either in terms of recombination of branes that wrap different intersecting cycles , or in terms of parallel splitting of branes that wrap parallel ( non - rigid ) cycles .",
    "[ for related work , see , e.g. , @xcite and for a review , @xcite . ]",
    "the focus of this paper will be on the second phenomenon of parallel splitting of branes .",
    "this is a specific phenomenon due to the fact that for toroidal orbifolds the cycles wrapped by d - branes are not rigid and thus the continuous parallel splitting of branes ( consistent with preservation of supersymmetry ) can take place . in the t - dual picture",
    "this geometric deformation can be interpreted as the introduction of wilson lines in the open string sector of string theory .",
    "[ for an analogous explicit study of continuous wilson lines for ( fractional ) d9-branes , their t - dual interpretation as moving d3-branes , as well as the field theory analysis of higgsing for a specific supersymmetric type iib chiral model on compact @xmath9 orientifold @xcite , see @xcite . ]",
    "the purpose of this paper is a few fold .",
    "first we would like to gain insight into the detailed interpretation of the symmetry breaking patterns in the case of splitting of branes that are parallel with orientifold planes .",
    "in particular , the breaking patterns in this case are non - trivial and also result in the change of the chiral spectrum and number of families .",
    "specifically , we discuss in detail the string theory results for all such breaking patterns in the case of toroidal @xmath1 orbifolds with the six - torus factorized as a product of three two - tori .",
    "the breaking pattern is qualitatively different when branes split from the orientifold planes in one two - torus , two two - tori and three two - tori directions , respectively .",
    "the gauge symmetry breaking pattern typically involves @xmath2 groups .",
    "we also discuss the symmetry breaking pattern when the branes are at angles relative to the orientifold planes ; there the symmetry breaking is that of @xmath3 .",
    "we also demonstrate how this string theoretic interpretation of symmetry breaking patterns is in one to one correspondence with the field theoretical interpretation in terms of higgsing of open - string moduli living on the branes .",
    "for the branes parallel with the orientifold planes the splitting in one , two and three two - tori corresponds to higgsing of one , two and three chiral superfields in the anti - symmetric representation of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "for the branes at angles the higgsing takes place due to the one , two and three moduli in the adjoint representation of @xmath3 , respectively .    as a by - product of this analysis we present three standard - like models , two supersymmetric ones and one non - supersymmetric one , in which the electroweak symmetry part of the standard model is associated with the branes parallel to the orientifold planes . as a global supersymmetric construction",
    "this possibility has not been addressed , yet .",
    "in particular , the four - family supersymmetric example and the three - family non - supersymmetric example are free from massless standard model chiral exotics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the string theory aspects of d - brane splitting and the resulting symmetry breaking patterns for the type iia @xmath10 orientifold , both for d6-branes parallel ( section 2a ) and not parallel ( section 2b ) to o6-planes . in section 3",
    "we analyze its dual field theory interpretation in terms of higgsing , again both for d6-branes parallel ( section 3a ) and not parallel ( section 3b ) to o6-planes . in section 4 , we present the new standard - model - like models in which the electroweak part is generated by splitting of branes parallel with the orientifold planes . in section 4a a four - family model without standard model chiral exotics is given .",
    "in sections 4b a non - supersymmetric three family example is presented .",
    "the higgsing can occur at a low or intermediate scale , which however must be large enough to suppress new flavor changing neutral current interactions . in section 4c",
    "we present a consistent supersymmetric three - family standard - like model based on @xmath11 electroweak symmetry .",
    "the standard model part of this model was originally proposed in @xcite on a toroidal orientifold ; it was locally supersymmetric but did not cancel rr tadopoles .",
    "conclusions and open questions are given in section 5 .",
    "the intriguing property of type iia orientifolds with intersecting d6-branes is the geometric interpretation both of the gauge symmetry and of the origin of the chiral spectrum . in particular ,",
    "different gauge group factors are generated from different d6-brane stacks / d - brane configurations , wrapping three - cycles of the orbifolds .",
    "the concrete group structure is determined by the orientifold and orbifold projections on the chan - paton factors for gauge bosons in the open string sector that start and end on the same stack of d - branes .",
    "the resulting symmetry breaking pattern is determined by the number of d - branes and the specific discrete projection , associated with the orientifold and/or orbifold symmetries , on chan - paton indices .",
    "the second intriguing feature is that the symmetry breaking pattern associated with stacks of d6-branes corresponds to a specific geometric operation on d6-branes .",
    "a first such typical process involves d6-branes from different ( intersecting ) stacks recombining and forming a new brane configuration .",
    "( within the specific construction based on the @xmath1 orientifold , the implications of d6-brane recombination for the gauge symmetry breaking pattern and the change in the chiral spectrum have been discussed @xcite . )",
    ". it can take place for intersecting d - brane stacks , where two group factors are broken down to one and the higgs role is played by the massless superfields in bi - fundamental representation located at the intersection of two brane stacks . in the non - supersymmetric case ,",
    "d - brane recombination can be interpreted as a tachyon condensation process .",
    "the second process involves a stack of d6-branes that split parallel to each other . comparing with d - brane recombination , d",
    "- brane splitting involves one single d - brane stack , and a single group factor is broken down to subgroups . for d6-branes parallel ( non - parallel ) with the orientifold planes the gauge group factor is @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , and in the dual field theory the higgs particles - moduli are three @xmath12 chiral superfields in the antisymmetric ( adjoint ) representations of the respective gauge group factors .",
    "the three copies of the higgs fields are in one to one correspondence with the geometric interpretation of splitting branes in one , two and three two - tori , which are generic deformations of the factorizable three - cycles wrapped by d6-branes on toroidal orbifolds .    for the sake of concreteness , in order to illustrate the correspondence between the d - brane splitting and field theory higgsing in type iia orientifold constructions , we focus on the @xmath13 orientifold .",
    "we briefly review the construction of the type iia @xmath14 orientifold ( for more details , refer to @xcite ) .",
    "we consider @xmath15 to be a six - torus factorized as @xmath16 whose complex coordinates are @xmath17 , @xmath18 for the @xmath19-th two - torus , respectively .",
    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 generators for the orbifold group @xmath22 , which are associated with their twist vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , act on the complex coordinates of @xmath25 as @xmath26 when a specific brane configuration is invariant under these orbifold actions , the corresponding chan - paton factors are subject to their projections , as discussed in the following subsections .",
    "[ the fact that d6-branes are invariant under orbifold projections does not imply that their intersection points will be .",
    "the final spectrum , however , turns out to be rather insensitive to this subtlety in the case of the @xmath27 orientifold construction .",
    "see @xcite for further discussions . ]",
    "the orientifold projection is implemented by gauging the symmetry @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is world - sheet parity , and @xmath30 acts as @xmath31 there are four kinds of orientifold 6-planes ( o6-planes ) due to the action of @xmath28 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "their configurations have been tabulated in table [ orientifold table ] and presented geometrically for rectangular two - tori in figure [ oplanes ] . in the following we shall focus on the case of rectangular tori , only .",
    "string states in the open string sector are subject to orbifold and orientifold projections on their chan - paton indices . for the states associated with the branes located on the top of the orientifold planes ,",
    "the brane configuration is invariant under the action of the orientifold @xmath35 projection as well as the orbifold projections @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the chan - paton indices for the open - string states in this sector are subject to all three projections .",
    "we choose the following specific @xmath36 representations for these group elements acting on the chan - paton indices associated with the stack of @xmath37 on the top of the orientifold fixed plane : @xmath38\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\gamma_{\\omega r } & = & \\pmatrix {   0 & \\id_{2n }   \\cr \\id_{2n } & 0 \\cr   } \\ , .\\label{gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above representations are the same as those in @xcite .",
    "the actions for the orbifold groups form a projective representation as explained in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 representations are compatible with all the symmetry constraints on the orientifold group action .",
    "they satisfy the following conditions : @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is chosen to be real , which is consistent with the choice for the orientifold projection on @xmath42-branes in type iib string theory .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite for details . ) in addition , @xmath43 and @xmath44 commute , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is no discrete torsion .",
    "note also that @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ , there are no twisted tadpoles .",
    "since the configuration of @xmath37 d6-branes positioned on the top of the o6-plane is invariant under all orbifold and orientifold projections , the chan - paton indices @xmath46 ( @xmath47 matrix ) , associated with the gauge boson states , should be invariant under all these projections and should satisfy : @xmath48 this sequence of projections yields the following symmetry breaking chain : @xmath49 therefore , the final gauge symmetry is @xmath2 with the resulting @xmath46 matrix of the form : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an arbitrary @xmath52 matrix , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are @xmath55 symmetric matrices .",
    "the structure of the chan - paton indices thus confirms that this is the adjoint representation of the @xmath2 gauge symmetry .",
    "since there are a number of the fixed o6-planes ( see figure [ oplanes ] ) , one can position sets of @xmath56 d6-branes on different fixed o6-planes , and then obtain in general @xmath57 gauge symmetry .",
    "( of course the final set of brane configurations has to cancel the r - r tadpoles , which puts constraints on the allowed values of @xmath58 . )",
    ".wrapping numbers of the four o6-planes .",
    "@xmath59 is equal to 0 and 1 for rectangular and tilted two - tori , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     interestingly , this specific standard model sector can be implemented into the consistent supersymmetric constructions based on the type iia @xmath7 orientifold .",
    "the models have an additional gauge sector and unfortunately possess the standard model chiral exotics that appear at the intersections of the standard model d6-branes with those of the additional gauge sector .    here",
    "we present one such model , with the third two - torus tilted .",
    "the d6-brane configurations and intersection numbers are given in table [ lssm ] .",
    "[ the model presented in the first version had a @xmath8 factor in the hidden sector which introduced odd - number of fundamental representations of the @xmath2 symmetries , and thus the model possessed the global anomaly @xcite ; the conditions for the absence of such global anomalies can be derived from k - theory @xcite and were given for type iia @xmath7 orientifolds in @xcite . ]",
    "we assume that the @xmath60 and @xmath61 stacks of d6-branes coincide with each other on the first torus .",
    "the standard model d6-branes have the same wrapping numbers as those of @xcite . in the observable sector",
    "the gauge symmetry is @xmath62 , where the anomalies from @xmath8 in @xmath63 are cancelled by the green - schwarz mechanism , and the gauge field of @xmath8 obtains mass via the linear @xmath64 couplings . using the equivalence @xmath65 , the gauge symmetry ( with massless gauge bosons ) is then @xmath66 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the pati - salam model . we can further break the @xmath67 symmetry down to the @xmath68 via the d6-brane splitting , which leads to @xmath69 gauge symmetry at the string scale .",
    "since in the standard model sector the d6-branes wrap the same three - cycles as those in @xcite , there are three families of the standard model fermions , and one pair of higgs doublets arising from the open strings which stretch between the @xmath60 and @xmath61 stacks of d6-branes .",
    "however , in order to cancel the rr tadpoles , we have to introduce an additional gauge sector , in particular , one @xmath70 and one @xmath71 groups .",
    "it turns out that all the standard model chiral exotic particles are charged under this @xmath70 , _",
    "i.e. _ , they appear at the intersection of the standard model d6-branes and the @xmath70 d6-brane .",
    "the hope is that they may become massive after the @xmath70 symmetries are broken . in this case at low energies this model would be very attractive : @xmath72 gauge symmetry can be broken down to the @xmath73 by the vevs of the scalar components in the right - handed neutrino superfields at several tev or at an intermediate scale ( if one accepts the landscape arguments  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore at the electroweak scale one would only have the mssm - like vacua .",
    "this is only a representative model in this class and one can construct variants of the above model by choosing different wrapping numbers for branes in the gauge sector beyond the standard model .",
    "however , these models typically possess additional standard model exotics .",
    "in this paper , we addressed in detail the string and field theory aspects of parallel d - brane splitting in type iia orientifolds .",
    "this is a specific phenomenon due to the fact that for toroidal orbifolds the cycles wrapped by d - branes are generically not rigid and thus the continuous parallel splitting of branes ( consistent with preservation of supersymmetry ) can take place .",
    "non - rigid cycles are generic for toroidal / orbifold compactifications , where the conformal field theory techniques can be employed to obtain the spectrum and couplings for four - dimensional models with potentially interesting particle physics properties .",
    "especially , the constructions with the intersecting d6-branes on orientifolds of that type have interesting particle physics implications .    for the sake of concreteness we analyse the d6-brane splitting on @xmath74 orientifold ( with factorizable @xmath75 ) .",
    "in particular , the symmetry breaking pattern for d6-branes parallel with the o6-planes is nontrivial , since it involves a combination of the orientifold and orbifold projections on chan - paton indices for open string states as well as putting branes in different configurations , related to each other by the geometric actions of the orientifold and orbifold group elements .",
    "we analysed all the possible symmetry breaking patterns with d6-brane splitting in one- , two- and three- two - tori , respectively . in a field theory",
    "we demonstrate one - to - one correspondence with the supersymmetry preserving higgs mechanism by giving vevs to one- , two- and three- chiral superfields , respectively .",
    "these superfields in the anti - symmetric representation of the original @xmath71 symmetry are the moduli associated with the parallel splitting of the d6-branes .    this symmetry breaking mechanism within the intersecting d6-brane construction allows for the change in the number of chiral families , which appear at the intersections of the split - branes with another stack of branes .",
    "this change in the number of chiral superfields is due to the fact that the original brane configuration on the top of the o6-plane was singular ( fixed plane of the orientifold action ) and thus the deformation from such a singular d - brane configuration allows for the change in the number of chiral fields .    for the sake of completeness",
    "we also address the symmetry breaking pattern for the branes not parallel with the orientifold planes , both in the string theory and field theory . in this case",
    "the higgsing is due to the three chiral superfields in the adjoint representation of the original @xmath76 symmetry .    as an application of this analysis we present three examples of new supersymmetric standard - like models where the end - point gauge symmetry and the spectrum is a consequence of brane - splitting , both those parallel with the orientifold planes and those that are not . in particular , we construct a four - family model with no standard model chiral exotics where the electroweak symmetry is obtained from the @xmath77 original brane configuration .    we also address a three - family model , again with no massless sm chiral exotics , in which the standard model is obtained by non - supersymmetric higgsing , which however does not have a consistent string theory interpretation in terms of d - brane deformations .",
    "such a model may be viable if the higgsing occurs at a low or intermediate scale .",
    "however , the scale should be at least @xmath78 tev to suppress unwanted flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "in addition , we present a consistent supersymmetric three - family standard - like model with one vector pair of higgs doublets and the @xmath79 electroweak symmetry arising in the original string construction .",
    "the wrapping numbers of the branes in the standard model sector are the same as those in @xcite , however , in our construction we found explicit additional brane configurations that cancel all the rr - tadpoles . on the other hand",
    ", these additional gauge sectors typically introduce standard model chiral exotics .",
    "the study presented in this paper porvides a useful tool for further constructions of intersecting d6-brane models models with potententially realistic particle physics .",
