    "throughout this note , all graphs and all digraphs are finite and simple .",
    "the notion of competition graphs was introduced by cohen  @xcite in a connection with a problem in ecology . given a digraph @xmath1 ,",
    "if @xmath7 is an arc of @xmath1 , then we call @xmath8 a _ prey _ of @xmath9 and @xmath9 a _ predator _ of @xmath8 . the _ competition graph",
    "_ @xmath10 of a digraph @xmath1 is the graph which has the same vertex set as @xmath1 and has an edge between two distinct vertices @xmath9 and @xmath8 if and only if there exists a common prey of @xmath9 and @xmath8 in @xmath1 . since cohen introduced the notion of competition graphs , several variants have been defined and studied by many authors ( see the survey articles by kim  @xcite and lundgren  @xcite ) . for example , scott  @xcite introduced competition - common enemy graphs ( or cce graphs ) , cable , jones , lundgren , and seager  @xcite introduced niche graphs , and sonntag and teichert introduced competition hypergraphs  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for competition multihypergraphs and @xcite for the hypercompetition numbers of hypergraphs ) . as another variant , roberts and sheng  @xcite introduced phylogeny graphs .",
    "the _ phylogeny graph _ of a digraph @xmath1 is the graph which has the same vertex set as @xmath1 and has an edge between two distinct vertices @xmath9 and @xmath8 if and only if there exists an arc from @xmath9 to @xmath8 or an arc from @xmath8 to @xmath9 or a common prey of @xmath9 and @xmath8 in @xmath1 .    in the study of competition graphs and their variants ,",
    "one of important problems is characterizing the competition graphs of interesting classes of digraphs ( see @xcite for some studies on this research direction ) . in this note , we study the phylogeny graphs of doubly partial orders .",
    "doubly partial orders are digraphs defined as follows . for a point @xmath11 in @xmath12",
    ", we denote its first and second coordinates by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . for @xmath15",
    ", we write @xmath16 if @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "a digraph @xmath1 is called a _ doubly partial order _ if there exists a finite subset @xmath19 of @xmath12 such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "note that , by definition , the out - neighborhood @xmath22 of a vertex @xmath11 in a doubly partial order @xmath1 is the set @xmath23 .",
    "we recall some results on variants of competition graphs of doubly partial orders .",
    "a graph @xmath5 is called an _ interval graph _ if there exists an assignment @xmath24 of real closed intervals @xmath25 to the vertices @xmath8 of @xmath5 such that , for any two distinct vertices @xmath8 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 if and only if @xmath28 . in 2005 , cho and kim @xcite showed the following :    [ thm : ck ] the competition graph of a doubly partial order is an interval graph .",
    "[ dpo2 ] an interval graph can be made into the competition graph of a doubly partial order by adding sufficiently many isolated vertices .    here , we mention that wu and lu @xcite gave a further result on this subject .",
    "they showed that a graph is the competition graph of a doubly partial order if and only if it is an interval graph , at least half of whose maximal cliques are isolated vertices .    after the study of cho and kim , several authors studied variants of competition graphs of doubly partial orders . in 2007 ,",
    "kim , kim , and rho @xcite showed that the cce graph of a doubly partial order is an interval graph unless it contains @xmath29 as an induced subgraph . in 2009 , kim , lee , park , park , and sano @xcite showed a similar result for niche graphs .",
    "the niche graph of a doubly partial order is an interval graph unless it contains @xmath30 as an induced subgraph . in 2011 ,",
    "park , lee , and kim @xcite studied the @xmath31-step competition graphs of doubly partial orders , and showed that , for any positive integer @xmath31 , the @xmath31-step competition graph of a doubly partial order is an interval graph .",
    "recently , kim , lee , park , and sano @xcite studied the competition hypergraphs of doubly partial orders .",
    "as the phylogeny graph is an important variant of the competition graph , it is natural to ask whether the phylogeny graph of a doubly partial order is an interval graph or not . in the following section ,",
    "we show that the phylogeny graph of a doubly partial order is always an interval graph .",
    "we use the following notations in this section : for @xmath15 , @xmath32 the following theorem is our first main result .",
    "[ thm : interval ] the phylogeny graph of a doubly partial order is an interval graph .    let @xmath5 be the phylogeny graph of a doubly partial order @xmath1 .",
    "we shall give an interval assignment @xmath24 such that @xmath5 is the intersection graph of the family of those intervals .",
    "we may disregard the isolated vertices of @xmath5 since we can assign an interval to an isolated vertex that does not overlap with any other interval .",
    "let @xmath33 be a function defined by @xmath34 .",
    "for a ( non - isolated ) vertex @xmath11 of @xmath1 , we define @xmath35 where @xmath36 means the convex hull of a set @xmath37 in @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath39 since @xmath40 .",
    "we will show that the graph obtained by deleting all the isolated vertices from @xmath5 is the intersection graph of the family of these intervals .",
    "take two adjacent vertices @xmath11 and @xmath41 of @xmath5 .",
    "then it holds that @xmath16 , or @xmath42 , or there exists a vertex @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath16 , then @xmath46 . if @xmath42 , then @xmath47 . if there exists a vertex @xmath43 such that @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath49 .    next , take two non - isolated vertices @xmath11 and @xmath41 which are not adjacent in @xmath5 .",

    "hence the theorem holds .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     theorem [ thm : ck ] and theorem [ dpo2 ] are complementary to each other . in the same fashion , after establishing theorem [ thm : interval ] , a natural question is if every interval graph is the phylogeny graph of some doubly partial order .",

    "suppose that there exists a doubly partial order @xmath1 such that the phylogeny graph of @xmath1 is equal to @xmath5 .",
    "since the edge @xmath74 is not contained in any triangle in @xmath5 , it holds that @xmath78 . since @xmath78",
    ", there can not exist a vertex @xmath79 in @xmath1 such that @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "however , since @xmath82 , either @xmath83 or @xmath84 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that @xmath84 .",

    "if there exists a vertex @xmath79 in @xmath1 such that @xmath88 and @xmath81 , then @xmath80 and @xmath89 form a clique of size @xmath90 in @xmath5 , which is a contradiction to the fact that @xmath78 .",
