    "the longitudinal viscosity @xmath0 is a transport coefficient of interest for fluids  @xcite .",
    "it is the counterpart to the better - known transverse viscosity  @xcite , which is more commonly called the shear viscosity @xmath1 .",
    "the latter characterizes the momentum flux perpendicular to a velocity gradient .",
    "these viscosities are theoretically predicted to be related by  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimensionality of the system , and @xmath2 is the bulk viscosity .",
    "the bulk viscosity @xmath2  @xcite is also called the volume viscosity or expansive viscosity ; it is a parameter for liquids as well as molecular gases  @xcite . both the shear and bulk viscosities appear in the navier - stokes equation  @xcite of a fluid . however , as compared with the shear viscosity @xmath1 , the longitudinal viscosity @xmath0 and the bulk viscosity @xmath2 are studied less often .",
    "physically , these kinds of viscosity characterize energy dissipation in a fluid .",
    "bulk viscosity is for energy dissipation due to compression and rarefaction of a fluid , for example in shock waves and high - frequency sound waves .",
    "shear viscosity , on the other hand , is for energy dissipation due to a gradient in the flow velocity . in the latter case ,",
    "the energy dissipation rate is proportional to both the shear viscosity and the square of the velocity gradient  @xcite . in the case of a periodic density perturbation ,",
    "the energy dissipation rate is proportional to both the bulk viscosity and the square of the rate of density change  @xcite .    unlike shear viscosity ,",
    "longitudinal and bulk viscosities are in general difficult to measure experimentally  @xcite .",
    "this is because the hydrodynamic effects of bulk viscosity are significant only for rapid time variations , unlike shear viscosity which affects flows in easily observed ways , even under steady conditions .",
    "ultrasound attenuation has been described as the only experimental method available for measuring bulk viscosity of a fluid  @xcite . in this method",
    ", one can obtain the bulk viscosity after subtracting the ultrasound attenuation contributions from thermal conduction and shear viscosity  @xcite .",
    "this method of measuring bulk viscosity is so difficult that it has been used only for water and a handful of exotic liquids  @xcite , and even for these substances the results for the bulk viscosity have large uncertainties .",
    "in contrast to this difficult experimental situation , however , longitudinal viscosity and bulk viscosity are mentioned more often in the theoretical literature , where it has been calculated for example using the green - kubo relation  @xcite , using the hydrodynamic limit  @xcite , or derived using a chapman - enskog approach  @xcite . in this paper",

    "dusty plasma  @xcite is partially ionized gas containing micron - size solid particles , also called dust particles .",
    "these dust particles are highly charged negatively within the plasma by absorbing more electrons than ions , since negatively charged electrons have a higher temperature than positively charged ions . due to the shielding provided by free electrons and ions in the plasma , the interaction between dust particles in a plasma",
    "can be modeled using a yukawa or debye - hckel potential  @xcite , similar to charged particles in a colloidal suspension  @xcite .",
    "because of the high particle charge , dust particles in plasmas are strongly coupled ( i.e. , the potential energy between neighboring particles is larger than its kinetic energy ) , so that the collection of dust particles exhibits properties of liquids or solids . in laboratory experiments",
    ", dust particles can be in two - dimensional ( 2d ) or three - dimensional ( 3d ) suspensions , depending on the experimental conditions . in 2d experiments ,",
    "all dust particles are confined in a horizontal plane , with negligible out - of - plane motion due to strong confining potentials in the vertical direction .",
    "the dust particles are immersed in a rarefied gas , which applies a much weaker friction to moving dust particles , as compared with the case of a colloid .",
    "the size of dust particles allows imaging them directly and tracking their motion , so that various transport mechanisms can be studied experimentally at the particle level .",
    "transport mechanisms that have been studied for dusty plasmas include diffusion  @xcite , shear viscosity  @xcite , and thermal conduction  @xcite .",
    "for 2d dusty plasmas , viscosity is generally attributed to dust particle scattering arising from interparticle interactions , while scattering due to the molecules of rarefied gas is negligible , as explained in  @xcite .",
    "shear viscosity has been widely studied for dusty plasmas , first in simulations for 3d systems  @xcite , then later in experiments  @xcite and simulations  @xcite for 2d systems , as well as 3d experiments  @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal viscosity and the bulk viscosity have been quantified for classical 3d one - component plasmas ( ocp )  @xcite using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and gluon plasmas  @xcite , however , it has until now not been quantified for classical 2d dusty plasmas , to the best of our knowledge .    in this paper , we will report a determination of the longitudinal viscosity for a 2d yukawa liquid .",
    "we will also report an unusual finding regarding the bulk viscosity : it is either negligibly small or it is not a meaningful transport coefficient , for a 2d yukawa liquid .",
    "green - kubo relations are often used to calculate various transport coefficients , such as diffusion  @xcite , shear viscosity  @xcite , and thermal conductivity  @xcite .",
