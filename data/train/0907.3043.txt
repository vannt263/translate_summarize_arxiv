    "the charmonium spectroscopy has been recently pushed forward with the unexpected discovery of many new charmonium - like resonances in the @xmath16 factories at slac , kek and cesr .",
    "the @xmath16-factories , originally constructed to test matter - antimatter asymmetries or cp - violation , within or beyond the standard model , discovered a number of interesting charm and hidden charm mesons which do not seem to have a simple @xmath17 structure .",
    "the first of these xyz states is the @xmath18 that was observed by the belle collaboration as a narrow peak near @xmath19 mev in the @xmath20 invariant mass distributions in @xmath21 decays @xcite .",
    "belle also observed that the rate of the decay @xmath22 was comparable to @xmath23 @xcite , with the @xmath24 or @xmath25 coming from @xmath26 or @xmath27 which would imply the @xmath18 is a mixture of both @xmath6 and @xmath28 @xcite ( see however @xcite for alternative explanations of that ratio ) .",
    "the close value of the @xmath18 mass to the sum of the masses @xmath29 mev led to consider the @xmath18 as a molecule - like bound state of a @xmath30 and a @xmath31 meson , and much work on the properties of these possible systems has been done @xcite .    the next xyz states , that we will consider in this paper , are the @xmath32 , the @xmath3 , the @xmath5 and the @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath32 was observed in the double - charmonium production reaction @xmath34 with mass @xmath35 mev and width @xmath36 mev @xcite .",
    "after that belle also observed a @xmath9 mass peak in the @xmath37 reaction @xcite . whereas the @xmath38 has been observed ,",
    "there is no signal for the @xmath39 or the @xmath40 decays . because of that and the fact that the @xmath41 and @xmath42 were also produced in double - charm production , it was believed that the @xmath32 could have @xmath43 , being a @xmath44 charmonium state ( @xmath45 ) , but there are problems with this assignment since in this case the @xmath32 should have a mass @xmath46 @xmath47 mev or even higher @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems very unlikely that the @xmath32 is a @xmath17 state .",
    "belle has observed a state with a decay mode @xmath48 in @xmath49 decays @xcite and babar has confirmed it @xcite , although the values for the mass and width reported by babar are smaller than belle s values ( @xmath50 mev and @xmath51 mev is reported by belle and @xmath52 mev and @xmath53 mev by babar ) . in principle , the mass and width of the @xmath3 suggest a radially excited p - wave charmonium state but then the @xmath54 would be the dominant decay mode and has not been observed .",
    "hence , it seems very unlikely that the reported @xmath3 and @xmath32 represent different decay modes of the same state @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 assignment in the case that the @xmath3 were a charmonium state is not very clear .",
    "indeed , for a charmonium state with @xmath43 ( @xmath56 ) the mass is a little low and for @xmath57 the mass is too high @xcite , also if it had a simple @xmath17 structure one would expect that the open charm decay modes would be dominant , and the other , @xmath40 , negligible .",
    "also , the large partial width @xmath48 , estimated above @xmath58 mev @xcite , is quite larger than the measured partial widths for any of the observed hadronic transitions between charmonium states .",
    "belle has recently observed a mass peak in the @xmath9 system in the @xmath59 reaction @xcite .",
    "this state with a mass of @xmath60 mev and a width of @xmath61 mev has been called @xmath5 .",
    "the production mechanism ensures that it has @xmath62 .",
    "the known charmonium states seen from a @xmath59 reaction have @xmath63 , thus , although this state could be identified with a @xmath64 ( @xmath45 ) or @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) charmonium state , the mass predicted in the first case would be smaller ( @xmath47 mev ) and higher ( @xmath67 mev ) in the second case @xcite .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration at fermilab has announced a narrow peak near the @xmath68 threshold , which is designated as @xmath69 , observed in the @xmath70 decay , it has a mass @xmath71 mev and a width @xmath72 mev @xcite .",
    "the width observed is quite different from the one reported by belle for the @xmath5 @xcite , suggesting that one is taking about a different state .",
    "another point is the structure and quantum numbers .",
    "there are some predictions : in @xcite the authors solved the schrdinger equation from the potential obtained using effective lagrangians and they found molecular solutions for @xmath73 and @xmath69 with @xmath74 , concluding that the @xmath73 and the @xmath69 are molecular partners . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors assume that the @xmath3 and the @xmath69 are hadronic molecules with quantum numbers @xmath7 or @xmath8 whose constituents are the charm vectors @xmath9 for the @xmath3 and @xmath75 for the @xmath69 and they calculate the decay rates of the observed modes @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the case @xmath7 .",
    "the coupling constants are determined by means of the compositeness condition @xcite and the results for these decay modes support the molecular interpretation of the @xmath73 and the @xmath69 . in @xcite",
    "the authors use qcd sum rules to evaluate the mass of a possible mesonic state that couples to a molecular @xmath75 current . whereas in @xcite",
    "a mass @xmath78 gev is found , concluding that it is possible to describe the @xmath69 as a @xmath79 molecular state , in @xcite they find a larger value of the mass @xmath80 gev . in @xcite",
    "the authors suggest possible assignments for the charmonium - like `` x , y , z '' states , for example the @xmath5 could be assigned to a @xmath81 state .",
    "also in @xcite the authors find that the p - charmonium @xmath82 associated to the @xmath69 is problematic because of the upper limit of the branching ratio of the decay @xmath83 computed of the order of @xmath84 . in @xcite a tetraquark structure is suggested for this state , while in @xcite it is argued than the peak at this energy is just a @xmath85 threshold effect .",
    "the @xmath33 is also reported by belle as a peak in the spectrum of @xmath39 mesons produced in @xmath86 collisions , with mass and width @xmath87 mev and @xmath88 mev . in the production process",
    "the two photons can only produce @xmath39 in a @xmath89 or @xmath8 states .",
    "the belle measurements favors the @xmath8 hypothesis , making the assignment of the @xmath33 to the @xmath90 charmonium state possible @xcite , following the arguments given in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will propose a theoretical explanation on the nature of some of these xyz states , providing structure and quantum numbers for them .",
    "our work is based on the hidden gauge symmetry ( hgs ) formalism for the interaction of vector mesons , which was introduced by bando - kugo - yamawaki @xcite .",
    "this hidden gauge formalism has been applied in @xcite for the @xmath91 interaction , giving rise to two bound @xmath92 states that could be identified with the @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "after that , the radiative decay of these states into @xmath86 was studied in @xcite , obtaining results in good agreement with the pdg @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite was later extended to @xmath95 @xcite , where several states were found that could also be identified with some of the pdg .",
    "recently , the @xmath96 , @xmath97 interaction was studied within the same formalism @xcite , generalizing to @xmath98 the basic hidden gauge lagrangians , but breaking the @xmath98 symmetry in the vector exchange diagrams .",
    "some states were found which could be identified with the @xmath99 and the @xmath100 , giving a prediction of the quantum numbers for the last one @xmath101 in the case the correspondence was correct , and providing a reasonable explanation for the small width of this state .",
    "also , a new @xmath102 state was predicted with @xmath103 , a mass close to @xmath104 mev and width of about @xmath105 mev .",

    "our starting point is the lagrangian , which involves the interaction of vector mesons amongst themselves , coming from the formalism of the hidden gauge symmetry ( hgs ) for vector mesons @xcite @xmath107 where the symbol @xmath108 stands for the trace in the @xmath98 space and @xmath109 is given by @xmath110\\ , \\label{vmunu}\\ ] ] with @xmath111 given by @xmath112 and @xmath113 mev the pion decay constant . using the value of @xmath111 in eq .",

    "the formalism is the same used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some approximations were made there which make the formalism handy and reliable , by neglecting the three - momentum of the vector mesons with respect to their masses .",
    "it is interesting to see that with this approximation one obtains @xcite from the hidden gauge approach the chiral local lagrangians which are used to study the interaction of pseudoscalar mesons among themselves and the pseudoscalar mesons with vector mesons and with baryons @xcite .",
