    "this line list covers the spectral range 0 - 12,000 @xmath1  and is expected to be fairly accurate for all temperatures up to 1500 k ( 1226 @xmath2c ) .",
    "in particular , byte shows errors in band origins which can be up to a 3 or 4 @xmath1  for bands involving high - lying vibrational states @xcite but can be expected to be lower for the region studied here and to extrapolate smoothly with @xmath5 for a given band .",

    "this article has the following structure .",
    "the experimental set - up used for the measurements is described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 gives an overview the assignment procedure and the method used to calculate experimental and theoretical absorbance spectra .",
    "the accuracy of byte is assessed by a direct comparison with the experimental spectra in section 4.1 and summary of all assignments is given in section 4.2 .",
    "finally our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the experimental setup is described in our previous work @xcite , the main points are summarised below .",
    "an agilent 660 ftir spectrometer , linearised mercury - cadmium telluride ( mct ) detector , ceramic high - temperature gas - flow cell ( c - hgc ) ( see figure  [ f : gascellc ] ) and an external ir light source , which is blackbody - like ( bb ) at 1800 k were used in the measurements .",
    "the optical setup is illustrated in figure  [ f : opticalsetup ] .",
    "the c - hgc operates at temperatures up to 1873 k ( 1600 @xmath2c ) @xcite and has also been used by the technical university of denmark ( dtu ) group @xcite to study for example hot co , co@xmath6 , ch@xmath7 and h@xmath6o .",
    "this cell has a fully - heated , temperature - uniform central part and two partially - heated buffer parts with interchangeable optical ( kbr ) windows at the ends .",
    "the buffer parts are purged with n@xmath8  or dry air taken from a purge generator while the sample gas ( e.g. n@xmath8  + nh@xmath0 ) is preheated and fed into the central part of the cell .",
    "laminar flow sheets ( flow windows ) are established between the central and buffer parts where the purge and sample gases meet , meaning the sample gas can not reach , or react with or form deposits on , the optical windows @xcite . to minimise reactions with the internal surface of the gas cell the inner part of the c - hgc is made from high quality pure ceramic ( al@xmath6o@xmath4(99.5@xmath9 ) ) .",
    "the absorption path length , defined by the flow windows , has a value of 53.3 cm at room temperature . at higher temperatures",
    "the length changes a little due to thermal expansion .",
    "thus at 1027 @xmath2c the length is 53.8 cm that is an increase of about 0.9%  of its value at room temperature , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an nh@xmath4 ( 9.94% ) concentration in n@xmath6 ( 99.998% ) was obtained by mixing n@xmath6 ( 99.998% ) and nh@xmath4 ( 99.98% ) flows controlled using a high - end ( bronkhorst ) mass - flow controllers ( mfc ) .",
    "the n@xmath6 ( 99.998% ) bottle was obtained from air liquide and the nh@xmath4 ( 99.98% ) bottle was obtained from linde gas .",
    "the remaining gas in the nh@xmath4 ( 99.98% ) bottle was considered to be air .",
    "the accuracy of the mfc was taken to be @xmath10%  of the reading plus @xmath11%  of the full scale .",
    "therefore for the n@xmath6 the mfc accuracy under measurement conditions was @xmath12% .",
    "if other than calibration gas is used , one needs to add the uncertainty in the conversion factor from calibration gas to actual gas which is in our case is 3.6% ( for nh@xmath4 instead of ar ) .",
    "therefore the ar mfc ( used with nh@xmath4 ) has an accuracy of 6.2 further details on the c - hgc , its performance and a comparison with the other hgcs in the laboratory will be presented elsewhere @xcite . for",
    "now the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .    single beam ( sb ) spectra from measured interferograms at a nominal spectral resolution 0.09 @xmath1 are calculated using agilent resolution pro software ( supplied with the ftir spectrometer ) using inverse fast fourier transform ( fft ) and boxcar and triangular apodization functions .",
    "mertz phase correction is applied , see griffiths and de haseth s book @xcite .",
    "triangular apodization results in less noise in the final spectra while boxcar apodization gives narrower peaks .",
    "the boxcar apodization allows one to maximize the possible ftir spectrometer performance in the sense of spectral resolution .",
    "if the true line widths are at least 5 times greater than the spectral resolution of the ftir , then the measured line profiles can be considered as true ones and therefore more fundamental studies about line shape can be carried out .",
    "this is the case , for example , for high - pressure measurements with a ftir of similar class to ours .",
    "this is also the case when spectra are broad ( i.e. with a continuum - like structure ) . for our spectra",
    "( and for pnnl in general ) there is no big difference between the boxcar and triangular apodizations , except for very closely - spaced lines , because one needs to model spectrum at the ftir resolution in any case , even for 0.112 @xmath1  resolution . to ensure consistent results",
    "both sets of calculated sb spectra were used in the final analysis .",
    "measured wavenumbers were multiplied by a factor of 1.000059 to account for the linear wavenumber shift caused by beam divergence , in accordance with the discussion in ref .",
    "the experimental uncertainties on absorbance measurements were determined by comparison of two high - resolution nh@xmath4 spectra measured on two separate days and estimated to be 2.9  %  for 3050  3650 @xmath1 , 5.1  %  for 4200  4600 @xmath1  and 7.7  %  for 4860 - 4900 @xmath1 .",

    "experimental transmission spectra @xmath13 at a temperature @xmath14 [ k ] and a line position @xmath15 [ @xmath1 ] are calculated from four sb spectra .",
    "this four measurements scheme is needed because the ir light source used is not modulated but modulation of the ir light appears in the ftir spectrometer .",
    "therefore , the mct detector in the ftir spectrometer will `` see '' both modulated emissions from the light source and the cell .",
    "moreover at 1027  @xmath2c many of nh@xmath4 bands appear in emission as well and the additional measurements with the cold beam stopper allow one to separate emission from absorption .",
    "the four measurements are two reference ( n@xmath8  in the central part of the cell ) measurements @xmath17 and @xmath18 and two sample ( n@xmath8  + nh@xmath0  mixture ) measurements @xmath19 and @xmath20 , one with and one without signal from the bb ( at 1800 k ) @xcite :    @xmath21    spectra without signal from the bb are measured from a cold ( room temperature ) beam stopper placed at 90 degrees from the optical axis of the setup using a movable mirror in the bb adapter .",

    "first the true transmission spectrum was computed as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the absorption path length in cm , @xmath29 is the nh@xmath0  concentration in @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the pressure - broadened nh@xmath0  absorption cross - section calculated using byte and the procedure laid out in @xcite , but replacing the gaussian line shape with a voigt line shape .",
    "lorentz half - widths were estimated from the experimental spectra and with reference to measured widths compiled in the hitran database .",
    "the measured ( effective ) transmittance spectrum is derived by convolving @xmath32 with the instrument line shape ( ils ) function @xmath33 :    @xmath34    for boxcar apodization , the ils is a @xmath35 function :    @xmath36    for triangular apodization , the ils is a @xmath37 function :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is commonly termed the ftir retardation and is generally defined as the inverse of the nominal resolution of the spectrometer @xcite .    the theoretical absorption spectrum is then computed as :    @xmath40\\ ] ]      first a list of observable byte lines for the experimental conditions was compiled . for this purpose",
    "the absorbance of each line , @xmath41 , was approximated as :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is an effective line width which is assumed to be a constant for all lines in the spectrum and the quantity @xmath44 represents an effective cross section assuming rectangular line shapes with @xmath43 widths .",
    "if both the upper and lower energies involved in a observable transition were known experimentally , the byte line position was replaced by the marvel line position generated by subtracting upper and lower state energies .",
    "this hybrid line list , which retains all the byte transitions , will be presented elsewhere @xcite ; it shall henceforth be referred to as barvel .",
    "taking the resolution of the measurements and the accuracy of byte intensities into account ( see section 4.1 ) , experimental peaks and barvel line positions were coupled using python scripts to produce a trivial assignment list . in cases where multiple barvel lines corresponded to a single peak , the peak was assigned to the strongest line .",

    "was then compared to previous studies , namely those catalogued in the hitran database @xcite .",
    "the absorption measurements were performed at a temperature of 1027 @xmath2c for the nh@xmath0  volume concentration of 10@xmath9 .",
    "the measurements were used to test the accuracy of byte then analysed using byte to generate an assignment list for the data .",

    "overall , taking into account the experimental noise , there is good agreement .",
    "however there are shifts in line position of the order @xmath3 0.2 @xmath1  across the entire spectral range and shifts up to @xmath3 1 - 2 @xmath1  in a few regions , particularly at higher wavenumbers .",
