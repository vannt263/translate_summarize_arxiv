    "galaxies and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are not distributed randomly in the universe .",
    "the small primordial fluctuations in the matter density field present in the very early universe have progressively grown through gravitational collapse to create the complex network of clusters , groups , filaments , and voids seen in the distribution of structure today .",
    "galaxies and agns , as well as groups and clusters of galaxies , are believed to populate the collapsed dark matter halos ( dmhs ) .",
    "the clustering of galaxies and agns therefore reflects the spatial distribution of dark matter in the universe .",
    "this allows clustering measurements to be used to derive cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these measurements also allow us to study the complex physics which governs the creation and evolution of galaxies and agns , as well as the co - evolution of galaxies and agns .",
    "the co - evolution scenario is motivated by the observed correlation between the mass of the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) and the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , lending strong evidence to an interaction or feedback mechanism between the smbh and the host galaxy .",
    "the specific form of the feedback mechanism , as well as the details of the agn triggering , accretion , and fueling mechanisms , remains unclear .",
    "different cosmological simulations address possible scenarios for the co - evolution of agns and their host galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "large volume , high - resolution simulations that include physical prescriptions for galaxy evolution and agn feedback make predictions for the spatial clustering and large - scale environments of agns and galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . observed clustering measurements of agns can be used to test these theoretical models , put constraints on the feedback mechanisms , identify the properties of the agn host galaxies , and understand the accretion processes onto smbhs and their fueling mechanism .",
    "x - ray surveys allow us to identify agn activity without contamination from the emission of the host galaxy , i.e. , therefore efficiently detecting even low luminosity agns . in the current era of deep and wide - area x - ray surveys with extensive spectroscopic follow - up , measurements of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) clustering of agn in various redshift ranges are emerging ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , our knowledge of agn clustering in the low redshift universe @xmath19 ) is still poor , except for optically selected type ii agns ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is due to the lack of observable comoving volume and the low number density of low-@xmath2 agns .",
    "exceptionally large survey areas with good sensitivity are needed to acquire a sufficiently large number of objects for clustering measurements .    to date",
    ", the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; @xcite ) is the most sensitive survey to have mapped the entire sky in x - rays .",
    "surveys with modern higher - sensitivity x - ray observatories such as _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ cover much smaller areas of the sky ( area : @xmath00.1 - 10 deg@xmath20 ) . therefore , the available comoving volume from these deeper data sets is not sufficient to accurately measure agn clustering at low redshifts @xmath19 ) .",
    "serendipitous surveys , such as extended champ ( @xcite ) and 2xmm ( @xcite ) , cover larger areas ( @xmath033 deg@xmath20 and @xmath0360 deg@xmath20 , respectively ) .",
    "however , the large variations in sensitivity between different observations and the non - contiguous sky coverage make serendipitous surveys unsuitable for wide - area clustering measurements .",
    "a few studies have attempted to measure the auto - correlation function ( acf ) of rass - based agn samples .",
    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) angular correlation functions ( @xcite ) do not require redshift measurements for each agn , but the projection heavily dilutes the clustering signal .",
    "furthermore , the deprojection of the angular clustering to the 3d correlation function is subject to uncertainties in the redshift distribution , which can be substantial .",
    "direct measurements of the 3d rass - agn acf with spectroscopic redshift measurements have been made by @xcite and @xcite with a few hundred agns , respectively , providing clustering measurements that have large statistical uncertainties caused by the relatively small sample size .",
    "@xcite positionally cross - correlated rass sources with spectroscopic data available from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "this dramatically increased the number of rass - agns with spectroscopic redshift measurements , which we use here to provide significant improvements in the measurement of agn clustering at low redshift .",
    "furthermore , the availability of spectroscopic redshifts for large samples of sdss galaxies in the same volume allows us to use an alternative approach to infer the clustering of agn using calculations of the agn ",
    "galaxy cross - correlation function ( ccf ) .",
    "this approach uses much larger samples of agn  galaxy pairs and hence significantly reduces the uncertainties in the spatial correlation function compared with direct measurements of the agn acf .",
    "furthermore , the use of a ccf avoids the problem that we have to correct for the complex angular dependences of limiting sensitivity in the x - ray sample .",
    "we therefore have initiated a program to investigate the clustering properties of low redshift ( @xmath21 ) rass - agns through measurements of the ccf of these agns with sdss luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) . in this study , we chose lrgs as the corresponding galaxy sample because they have a significant overlap in redshift range with our x - ray sample ( details are described later ) .    in this first paper of a series , we explain the data selection , as well as the calculation of the ccf and the inferred rass - agn acf .",
    "we also investigate the x - ray luminosity dependence of the clustering properties and biases . in a follow - up paper ( t. miyaji et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , we will focus on applying the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model to the calculated ccf between rass - agns and lrgs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we describe the construction and properties of the lrg and x - ray agn samples in details .",
    "all essential steps to measure the ccf , compute the acf via the ccf , and estimate errors are explained in section  3 .",
    "the results of the clustering measurements for the different x - ray agn samples and their luminosity dependence are given in section  4 .",
    "we discuss these results in section  5 in the context of other studies and conclude in section  6 . throughout the paper , all distances , luminosities , and absolute magnitudes",
    "are measured in comoving coordinates and given in units of @xmath7mpc , where @xmath22kms@xmath5 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "we use a cosmology of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use ab magnitudes throughout the paper .",
    "all uncertainties represent a 1@xmath11 ( 68.3% ) confidence interval unless otherwise stated .",
    "the optical data analyzed in this study are drawn from the sdss ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use data both from the main galaxy sample , which has a spectroscopic depth of @xmath25 ( @xcite ) , and the lrg sample , which has a spectroscopic depth of @xmath26 , significantly fainter than the main galaxy sample .",
    "the lrg sample was designed for studies of large - scale structure to higher redshift ; it covers a larger volume than the main galaxy sample .",
    "here we use the lrg sample as a large - scale structure tracer set to calculate the ccf with the rass - agn , as the lrg sample covers a similar redshift range as the rass - agns .    the target selection and the properties of the lrg sample",
    "are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "two different selection criteria ( cut i and cut ii ) were introduced in identifying lrgs as at @xmath27 the typical 4000   break in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an early - type galaxy drops out of the @xmath28 band and falls into the @xmath29 band .",
    "@xcite shows that up to @xmath30 a volume - limited sample of lrgs with passively evolving luminosity and rest - frame colors is selected with a very high efficiency ( 95% for cut i and 90% for cut ii ) .",
    "@xcite advised that the lrg selection algorithm should not used for objects @xmath31 .",
    "the lrg sample was obtained using the web - based sdss catalog archive server jobs system .",
    "the appropriate objects are selected through the prime target flag galaxy_red ( @xcite ) . in sdss dr2 ,",
    "the model magnitude code was changed ( @xcite ) to improve the star ",
    "galaxy separation .",
    "this also caused a slight change in the lrg sample definition .",
    "we make use of the updated lrg sample selection .",
    "we extract 115,577 lrgs in the dr7 data release that have a spectroscopic redshift of @xmath32 , a galaxy spectral - type classification , and a redshift confidence level of @xmath33 .",
    "we discovered that 3% of objects flagged galaxy_red ( i.e. , both cut selections ) in dr7 do not fall within the lrg selection criteria ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this does not happen in earlier data releases prior to dr7 .    to calculate the rass - agn  lrg ccf",
    ", we wish to define an lrg sample that is both volume - limited and contains a high number density of lrgs to maximize the number of possible agn ",
    "lrg pairs .",
    "table  1 of @xcite defines three different volume - limited lrg samples , corresponding to different luminosity ranges , that they use to measure the lrg acf .",
    "the first volume - limited lrg sample , with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , contains the highest number density of objects .",
    "here we adopt the same lrg sample definition , as this sample is the best suited to our scientific goals .",
    "we select lrgs from dr7 that meet the criteria of this sample , and we refer to the subsequent data here as lrg sample. we further limited our survey area to dr4 + to match the x - ray sample ( see section  [ unification ] ) .",
    "the properties of this sample are shown in table  [ xagn_samples ] .    the selected lrgs span a range in redshift . to construct a volume - limited sample",
    ", one must correct their time - evolving sed to account for the evolution of the stellar population and the redshifting . as described in the appendix of @xcite",
    ", we use the extinction corrected @xmath36 magnitude to construct the @xmath37-corrected and passively evolved rest - frame @xmath38 magnitudes ( non - star - forming model ) .",
    "@xcite passively evolve their @xmath39 to @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 ( @xcite ; we refer to this magnitude by using the notation @xmath42 ) .",
    "the stellar population synthesis ( sps ) code described in @xcite is used to derive the purely passive evolution correction .",
    "lrgs are @xmath43 brighter at @xmath40 compared to @xmath41 .",
    "this value is similar to the one used in @xcite who state that the evolution is about 1 mag per unit redshift .",
    "we extensively tested that our lrg sample meet the lrg selection criteria of both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we only consider objects that are located in areas of the sky that have a spectroscopic completeness fraction in dr7 of @xmath44 .",
    "the vast majority of the objects in our sample ( 99.9% ) belong to the lrg cut i criteria .",
    "@xcite describe the algorithm used for positioning tiles in the plane of the sky and assigning spectroscopic fibers for observing objects in the sdss .",
    "the resulting spectroscopic sample of sdss is spatially biased in that fibers on the same tile can not be placed closer than 55 arcsec .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are available for galaxy pairs closer than 55 arcsec only if the field is observed at least twice .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , not taking into account the effects of these fiber collisions would systematically underestimate measured correlation functions , even on large scales .",
    "@xcite provide publicly available collision - corrected sdss catalogs suitable for robust large - scale structure studies .",
    "they assign a redshift to a galaxy which has no spectroscopic redshift by giving it the redshift of that galaxy in a galaxy group that is positionally the closest and has a spectroscopic redshift .",
    "however , these catalogs are generated only for the main galaxy sample , not the lrg sample .",
    "to correct our lrg sample for fiber collisions , we therefore use the following approach .",
    "we select from the sdss catalog archive server all lrg objects that passed the pure photometric - based cut i and cut ii selection criteria , with no spectroscopic restrictions applied .",
    "photometrically selected lrgs that get a redshift assigned are only those which have a spectroscopic lrg within a separation of @xmath45 .",
    "this corresponds to 2% ( 1004 objects ) of the total lrg sample .",
    "our redshift assignment is a two stage process .",
    "first , if the photometrically selected lrg is included in the primary spectroscopic lrg sample but its redshift was initially rejected due to a low confidence level of @xmath46 , the spectroscopic redshift is now accepted independent of its confidence level to correct for fiber collisions .",
    "this specific procedure assigns a redshift only to nine objects .",
    "as a next step , we make use of the substantially improved dr7 photometric redshift code ( @xcite ) compared to earlier sdss data releases . if the difference between the spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath47 ) of an lrg and the photometric redshift ( @xmath48 ) of a neighboring ( within a 55 arcsecond radius ) lrg is @xmath49 then the photometric lrg is assigned the same redshift as the spectroscopic lrg . otherwise the photometric redshift is taken to be the correct redshift for the photometric lrg .",
    "more than half of all photometric lrg redshifts are assigned the spectroscopic redshift of a neighboring lrg , while the remaining objects are assigned their photometric redshift .",
    "the above procedure for redshift assignment is used because simply adopting the photometric redshift for all objects that do not have a measured spectroscopic redshift would smear out the clustering signal in redshift space and therefore dilute the amplitude of the correlation function . @xcite verified that for areas of the sky with overlapping spectroscopic tiles , 60% of the galaxies that had a neighboring galaxy within 55 arcsec were within 10 mpc of the neighbor galaxy .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that lrgs are highly clustered , so using this procedure for lrgs will result in a higher success rate .",
    "the average photometric redshift error ( @xmath50 ) is 2% , and within our sample less than 1% ( 437 objects ) of the lrgs are assigned a photometric redshift .",
    "the rass ( @xcite ) is currently the most sensitive all - sky survey in the x - ray regime , with a typical flux limit of @xmath51 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) .",
    "the area of the sky covered is 99.7% , all of which has at least 50 s of exposure with _",
    "position sensitive proportional counters ( pspc ) .    based on the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) , @xcite classify 6224 agns with broad permitted emission lines in excess of 1000 kms@xmath5 fwhm and 515 narrow permitted emission line agns matching rass sources within 1 arcmin (",
    "note that 86% of all matches fall within 30@xmath52 ) .",
    "consequently , broad - line agns account for 92% of all rass / sdss classifications . in this study",
    ", we use the broad emission line rass - agns only .",
    "the rass sources are taken from both the rass bright source catalog ( @xcite ) and the rass faint source catalog ( @xcite ) and have a maximum likelihood ml @xmath53 .",

    "the rass / sdss target selection consists of two selection algorithm : the main sdss algorithm for galaxies and agns ( @xmath58 ) and the specific assignment of sdss fibers for rass identifications ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "@xcite explain in detail their selection of optical counterpart candidates .    to understand possible bias effects , which may influence our ccf measurements , we summarize the selection method briefly .",
    "the algorithm considers those sdss optical objects within 1 arcmin of the x - ray source position .",
    "optically detected objects qualify for sdss spectroscopy if their @xmath28 , @xmath29 , or @xmath60 magnitude is @xmath59 . since not every optically detected object that fulfills the criteria",
    "can be observed spectroscopically , different priority levels are introduced in target selection .",
    "the highest priority is given to objects with a triple positional coincidence of rass x - ray source , sdss optical object , and first ( @xcite ) radio source .",
    "the next priority level consists of sdss objects in the rass error circles with unusual optical colors indicating agns ( e.g. , uv - excess with @xmath61 ) .",
    "the third priority includes less likely , but plausible , counterparts such as bright stars and galaxies .",
    "the last group consists of any object in the magnitude limit that falls within the rass error circle .",
    "one rass / sdss spectroscopic fiber is assigned to the object with the highest priority level and a spatial offset less than 27.5 arcsec from the x - ray source .",
    "if multiple objects populate the same priority level , one is chosen at random for sdss spectroscopy .    before consideration",
    "is given to potential rass targets , an sdss fiber is first assigned to objects that belong to the main sdss sample , which includes both galaxies and optically identified agns .",
    "about 80% of all rass / sdss identifications are independently targeted for spectroscopy by the sdss main target selection algorithm .",
    "however , objects in the main sample can be observed at the cost of excluding high - priority rass targets . in these cases ,",
    "the rass / sdss identification is missing .",
    "for these reasons , the rass / sdss agn sample is only reasonably complete ( @xmath62% ) for agns with @xmath58 .",
    "objects identified by rass / sdss priority levels and not because of their belonging to the main sdss sample tend to be optically fainter , on average , than the main agn sample . in the @xmath63 versus",
    "@xmath64 color  color space , objects from both selection algorithms lie in the same region .",
    "studying their redshift distributions shows that objects identified by the rass / sdss priority levels are , on average , at higher redshifts than the identifications relying on the main sdss sample .",
    "this also explains their lower observed count rates x - ray fluxes .",
    "the x - ray hardness ratios of both populations are very similar .",
    "being fainter in x - rays and in the optical wavelengths leads to the same x - ray to optical flux ratio for the rass / sdss priority levels agns and the main sdss sample agns . therefore , except that rass / sdss priority levels agns are found on average at higher redshifts , no intrinsic differences between the rass / sdss agns from both selection methods are detected .    to create a well - defined x - ray agn sample to use for clustering measurements , we focus solely on broad emission line agns .",
    "s sensitivity to the soft energy band that is limited to @xmath652.4 kev selects against x - ray absorbed agns ( type ii ) , which are usually optically classified as narrow lines objects .",
    "therefore , the sample of broad emission line rass - agn is much more complete than the narrow emission line rass - agn sample . furthermore , the x - ray / optical counterpart identification is more reliable for the broad emission line agns than for the narrow emission line agns , which have much higher surface density ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "in addition to studying the clustering of the rass - agn sample , here we also test for possible differences in the clustering of low versus high x - ray luminosity rass - agn ( figure  [ lx_z ] ) .",
    "the commonly used x - ray dividing line between seyfert agns and high luminous qsos is in the 0.5 - 10 kev band ( intrinsic luminosity ; @xcite ) .",
    "although this dividing line is somewhat arbitrary , it is widely employed in literature , and we use it here .",
    "@xcite provide a table which list the galactic absorption - corrected 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosities assuming a photon index of @xmath66 . with this index",
    ", the agn / qso dividing line corresponds to a 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosity of ( figure  [ lx_z ] ) .",
    "this index agrees well with that found by @xcite in the _ xmm - newton _ spectra of pg quasars in the 0.5 - 2 kev band , where @xmath67 . in the same paper , it is shown that at higher energies ( 2 - 12 kev ) the mean photon index for pg quasars gets harder and is @xmath68 . here",
    "we use @xmath66 to be consistent with @xcite .",
    "the properties of our total rass - agn sample , low @xmath9 rass - agn sample , and the high @xmath9 rass - agn sample are shown in table  [ xagn_samples ] . in order to measure the ccf of the rass x - ray agns with lrgs",
    ", the x - ray samples must cover the same area of sky and redshift range as the lrg sample used here . in all samples ,",
    "no x - ray detected agn is also classified as an lrg .",

    "the results shown in this figure suggest that high redshift , low x - ray luminous agns tend to reside in higher mass dark matter halos ( @xmath311 @xmath7 @xmath209 ) than low redshift , high luminous agns .",

    "the availability of large optical data sets such as sdss , 2df qso redshift survey ( 2qz ) , and 2df - sdss lrg and qso ( 2slaq ) led to a series of large - scale clustering studies .",
    "however , many authors report only @xmath305 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which makes it difficult to compare their results to our @xmath89-based results .",

    "we compare only to studies that measured @xmath89 , listed in table  [ table : study ] ( middle section ) .",
    "most of the optically selected agn samples contain samples that are orders of magnitude larger than x - ray selected samples .",
    "@xcite use the ccf between @xmath05000 deep2 galaxies and 52 qsos to infer the qso acf .",
    "agns selected at optical wavelengths have relatively low clustering scale lengths , found over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "this translates into low bias parameters , not much larger than what we find for our low-@xmath2 rass - agns ( figure  [ oagn_b ] ) .",
    "radio - loud agns are found to be significantly more clustered than optically selected agns ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "optically bright and radio - loud quasars are also luminous in x - rays ( @xcite ) and reside in very massive dark matter halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "comparing the general trends seen in figure  [ xagn_b ] and [ oagn_b ] , x - ray and optically selected agns show similar clustering strength at @xmath312 .",

    "more massive galaxies should reside in more massive dark matter halos and therefore be more strongly clustered .",
    "more massive galaxies are expected to be more luminous , which should lead to a luminosity dependence of the clustering signal .",
    "this result has been confirmed by clustering measurements of , e.g. , sdss galaxies at low redshifts ( @xcite ) and of , e.g. , deep2 galaxies at @xmath316 ( @xcite ) . whether this relation applies also to the agn luminosity",
    "is unclear .",
    "the agn luminosity depends on the smbh mass , mass accretion rate , and radiative accretion efficiency . in the simple case in which all smbhs have the same eddington ratio and the same dependence of radiative efficiency on the eddington ratio ,",
    "then higher - luminosity agns will have higher smbh masses . _",
    "if _ there is a correlation between smbh mass and dark matter halo mass , then the higher - luminosity agns will also be more strongly clustered .",
    "the observed correlation between the mass of the smbh and the stellar velocity dispersion in the bulge of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) suggests that a luminosity ( x - ray and optical ) clustering dependence could be feasible and physically motivated , since massive bulges preferentially reside in massive dmhs .",
    "alternatively , even among galaxies with the same smbh mass , those that reside in a denser large - scale environment may have a higher chance of large mass accretion through galaxy mergers and interactions .",
    "however , this trend has not been detected , possibly due in part to the relatively large uncertainties in the clustering measurements of x - ray and optically selected agn samples .",
    "several studies have attempted to measure the dependence of clustering on x - ray luminosity .",
    "@xcite compute the clustering signal for a high and low x - ray luminosity agn sample in the _ xmm - newton_cosmos field at a dividing line of @xmath10 ergs@xmath5 and find no significant difference .",
    "@xcite studied an x - ray luminosity dependence in the _ chandra _ selected agn samples .",
    "as noted by both @xcite and @xcite , splitting the samples in different x - ray luminosities leads to the study of a high and low redshift sample of x - ray selected agns .",
    "these studies of the dependence of clustering on luminosity are therefore hampered by the redshift - luminosity degeneracy .",
    "taking into account the possible redshift evolution of the clustering signal , @xcite do not find a significant dependence of clustering on the x - ray luminosity .",
    "@xcite measure the clustering of agns with @xmath317 ergs@xmath318 ergs@xmath5 and @xmath319 ergs@xmath5 at similar redshift ( @xmath320 ) and find no significant difference in their clustering properties as well .",
    "our sample here covers a limited redshift range , @xmath73 , such that we do not expect a significant contribution of the redshift evolution to the clustering signal within our sample .",
    "in addition , our use of the ccf with a large tracer set of lrgs yields an agn acf with high precision . splitting the sample into a low and high x - ray luminosity sample at",
    "the commonly used agn / qso dividing line of allows us to detect an x - ray luminosity dependence of the clustering at the @xmath02.5@xmath11 level for the first time , in that x - ray luminous rass - agns at low-@xmath2 cluster more strongly than their low luminosity counterparts .",
    "although , as mentioned above , the tracer lrg sample is approximately volume - limited , in order to clearly test whether the difference in the clustering signal between the high and the low @xmath9 rass - agn sample could be caused by a change of the lrg acf with redshift ( which could mimic a luminosity dependence of the inferred rass - agn acf ) , the redshift dependence of the lrg sample acf must be analyzed .",
    "@xcite study dependence of the lrg clustering amplitude with luminosity and redshift and split their @xmath35 lrg sample into @xmath321 and @xmath322 subsamples ; they find no redshift evolution in the lrg clustering signal .",
    "we repeat this test and split our lrg sample into two subsamples containing object in redshift bins of @xmath323 and @xmath324 .",
    "we verify that the lrg acf of both subsamples agree to much better than 1@xmath11 and therefore exclude redshift evolution of the lrg clustering signal as a possible source of the detected luminosity dependence of the rass - agn clustering .",
    "optical qso / agn samples based on sdss , 2qz , and 2slaq samples yield comparable low uncertainties in the measured acf due to the large sample sizes ( up to a few 10,000 objects ) , allowing measurements of the luminosity dependence of clustering in optically selected qso / agn samples .",
    "@xcite compute the ccf at @xmath312 between qsos and lrgs from 2slaq , 2qz , and sdss to break the redshift - luminosity degeneracy .",
    "they find little qso - lrg cross - clustering dependence on qso luminosity , implying dark matter halo masses of @xmath311 @xmath7 @xmath209 approximately independent of qso luminosity .",
    "da ngela et al .  ( 2008 ) confirm that qsos of different luminosities reside in dark matter halos of similar mass ( @xmath325 @xmath7 @xmath209 ) for @xmath326 .    using the optical luminosity in table  [ table : study ] and the @xmath327 relation between the optical rest - frame flux density at 2500   and the x - ray luminosity flux density at 2 kev measured for 6224 agns with broad emission lines from @xcite , we derive the median x - ray luminosities of the optical agn samples .",
    "this allows us to compare these results with x - ray selected agn clustering measurements .",
    "the optically selected agn samples have median x - ray luminosities of @xmath328 ergs@xmath5 , which is very similar to the x - ray luminosity of our high @xmath9 rass - agn sample .",
    "these samples are shown in figure  [ xagn_b ] as gray filled ellipses .",
    "contrary to our findings for the x - ray luminosity dependence at low-@xmath2 , at higher redshift high luminosity optically selected agns appear to be _ less _ clustered than low luminosity x - ray selected agns .",
    "this implies that high luminosity agns at these redshifts lie in less massive dark matter halos than low luminosity agns .",
    "however , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray selected agns ( which define the x - ray samples at higher redshift ) contain a significant fraction of type ii agns , while optically selected agn samples contain mainly type i agns with broad optical emission lines .",
    "therefore , x - ray and optically selected samples at high redshifts probe different kinds of agns .",
    "optically selected , high luminosity agn samples at high redshifts and high @xmath9 rass - agn samples at low redshifts likely contain the same type of agns because of both _",
    "s soft energy selection being biased toward x - ray unabsorbed type i agns and the similar x - ray luminosities measured for both samples . in terms of their clustering properties , optically selected agn samples at higher redshift reside in host dark matter halo masses between @xmath329 @xmath7 @xmath209 and @xmath311 @xmath7 @xmath209 , similar to the full range observed for the low redshift rass - agn samples",
    ". stated differently , the dark matter halo masses of both the low @xmath9 and high @xmath9 rass - agn samples are consistent with those of the optically selected , high luminosity agns at higher redshift ( which have relatively large clustering uncertainties ) .    to summarize the clustering trends seen , at low redshift within the rass - agn broad - line sample , higher luminosity agns cluster more strongly than their lower luminosity counterparts , while at higher redshifts ( @xmath330 ) the higher luminosity optically selected agns are less clustered than the lower luminosity x - ray selected agns .",
    "however , the higher redshift x - ray agn samples contain a large fraction of narrow - line agns , and so these trends are not necessarily comparing the same kinds of agns at all redshifts and luminosities .",
    "for example , the low @xmath9 agns studied at high redshifts have lower luminosities than the low redshift , low @xmath9 rass - agns ( see table  [ table : study ] ) .",
    "we propose two possible explanations for the agn clustering trends observed , assuming the validity of the @xmath327 connection , i.e. , that over a wide range of x - ray and optical luminosity , both luminosities are closely connected independent of redshift :    \\1 ) the dominant accretion processes that are triggering agn activity could be different at different redshifts and/or halo masses .",
    "for example , one possible scenario is that at high redshift agns may be triggered by interactions or mergers between galaxies in group environments , while at low redshifts internal processes might be responsible .",
    "consequently , due to different underlying physics triggering agn activity , the observed agn clustering properties at low and high redshifts could differ .",
    "\\2 ) alternatively , the underlying physics may not evolve with time , but the kinds of agns being compared at different redshifts and luminosities are fundamentally different .",
    "it may be that high luminosity broad - line agns generally reside in lower mass dark matter halos ( at least out to @xmath304 ) , and within this population the brighter agns are more clustered .",
    "on the other hand , the lower luminosity agns probed in the deep @xmath304 surveys , which contain a mix of broad - line and narrow - line agns , may reside in more massive halos . in this scenario ,",
    "different kinds of agns can have different triggering mechanisms .",
    "the change in the luminosity dependence of the clustering signal seen with cosmic time is simply explained by observing different kinds of agns in the low and high redshift universe with current data sets .",
    "the present clustering measurements do not allow us to accept or reject these hypotheses ; smaller uncertainties on the observed clustering and detailed model predictions are needed . however , it is clear from the above results and discussion that there is not a simple relation between luminosity and clustering amplitude for agns .",
    "large - scale structure studies have established the dependence of galaxy clustering on morphological type , luminosity , color , spectral type , and stellar mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these quantities are strongly correlated with each other and with clustering amplitude . for a comparison with our agn clustering measurements , we focus on the color - dependence of galaxy clustering .",
    "the last section of table  [ table : study ] lists a representative sample of the color - dependent clustering measurements of galaxies to @xmath316 , where we have listed results for galaxies with @xmath331 , where we use @xcite ; @xcite , and @xcite to determine @xmath195 for each sample .",
    "the @xcite results in table  [ table : study ] correspond to galaxies 1 mag below @xmath332 but contain more objects and therefore yield more reliable clustering measurements .",
    "blue galaxies show a weaker clustering signal than red galaxies over the wide redshift range studied here ( @xmath333 ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "results from larger surveys agree with each other and indicate that red galaxies are hosted by dark matter halos of slightly higher mass than @xmath311 @xmath7 @xmath209 , while blue galaxies reside in halos of @xmath329 @xmath7 @xmath209 . at @xmath334 different studies find that red galaxies are more strongly clustered than blue galaxies , but the published clustering scale lengths are discrepant . in terms of inferred dark matter halo masses , our measurements are in agreement with @xcite , while the results by @xcite give dark matter halo masses which are too low when evolve into low-@xmath2 @xmath195 galaxies .",
    "the errors on the measurements of optical agn clustering are too large to constrain the host galaxy type using the clustering measurements ; the results are consistent with optical agns being hosted by either blue or red galaxies .",
    "however , @xcite find that at the 2@xmath11 level qsos are clustered like blue galaxies , not red , at @xmath316 .",
    "our clustering measurements strongly exclude the possibility that rass - agns reside in the very massive dark matter halos that host lrgs ( figure  [ gagn_b ] ) .",
    "interestingly , our sample of @xmath01000 low @xmath9 rass - agns clusters similarly to blue galaxies , while the high @xmath9 rass - agns ( @xmath335 ) have the same clustering amplitude as red galaxies at similar redshifts .",
    "this suggests that rass - agns are hosted in a mix of higher fraction of blue galaxies and lower fraction of red galaxies .",
    "using cross - correlation measurements between rass - agns and sdss lrgs , we measure the projected cross - correlation @xmath121 , and from this we derive the real - space auto - correlation function @xmath89 of x - ray selected agns with broad optical emission lines at @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath336 with an unprecedented precision . using the rass / sdss cross - identification sample by @xcite results in the largest sample of x - ray selected agns ( @xmath337 ) used for clustering studies , covering an area of 5468 deg@xmath20 .",
    "we detect a clustering signal at the @xmath011@xmath11 level and find a correlation length of @xmath338 @xmath7 mpc and @xmath339 , fitting on scales of @xmath340 @xmath7 mpc .",
    "we investigate the luminosity dependence of clustering using low and high x - ray luminosity subsamples defined using the common agn / qso dividing line of @xmath10ergs@xmath5 .",
    "we detect an x - ray luminosity dependence of the clustering signal at the @xmath02.5@xmath11 level , with the brighter sample being more clustered .",
    "this is contrasted with clustering measurements of low luminosity x - ray agns and optically selected qsos at redshift @xmath334 , which suggest that low x - ray luminosity agns are more strongly clustered and reside in more massive dark matter halos than their high x - ray luminosity counterparts .",
    "possible explanations are that ( 1 ) different mechanisms trigger agn activities at different redshifts and/or halo masses or ( 2 ) at all redshift , low luminosity agns and the brightest qsos reside in red galaxies , while most intermediate luminosity agns / qsos are hosted in blue galaxies .",
    "our low @xmath9 rass - agn sample exhibits a similar clustering amplitude as blue , star - forming galaxies at similar redshifts , while the high @xmath9 rass - agn sample clusters like red galaxies .",
    "the total rass - agn sample is likely dominated by blue host galaxies but includes a fair fraction of red host galaxies .",
    "we show that the auto - correlation function derived from cross - correlation measurements of @xmath01500 agns and @xmath050000 lrgs in an area of @xmath06000 deg@xmath20 constrains the auto - correlation function at the 10% level .",
    "although the rass is the most sensitive x - ray survey ever performed , only the most luminous and x - ray unabsorbed ( soft ) agns were detected .",
    "the upcoming all - sky _ erosita _ mission ( @xcite ) with its _ xmm - newton_-like soft and hard energy high sensitivity should detect @xmath0200,000 agns with much lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "the data generated by the mission will allow one to compute clustering measurements with a significantly higher accuracy .    to draw meaningful conclusions from agn clustering measurements using agn samples selected at different wavelengths and to address the evolution and luminosity dependence of agn clustering , lower uncertainties on the detected clustering signal are required .",
    "we describe and successfully show in this paper that the cross - correlation function can be used to not only measure the relative clustering of agn / galaxy samples but also to determine the auto - correlation function with relatively low uncertainties .",
