    "the statistical properties of coin tosses are full of mathematical wonders and shuichi tasaki was well aware of it . thus assume a fair coin tossing game and a sequence @xmath1 of @xmath2 binary digits , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where say the symbol @xmath5 stands for heads and @xmath6 for tails . the probability measure which assigns probability @xmath7 to every symbol irrespective of which of heads or tails came at the previous toss is invariant under such a process , which in particular is to say that every set of @xmath2 binary digits has the same measure @xmath8 .",
    "no surprise there .",
    "consider however an arbitrary number @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and let @xmath11 denote the probability measure which assigns measure @xmath9 to heads and @xmath12 to tails .",
    "this measure is itself invariant under fair coin tossings @xcite .",
    "the reason is simply that the set @xmath1 is the union of the two disjoint sets of length @xmath13 , @xmath14 since @xmath15 and @xmath16 , we have that the probability measure of the left and right hand sides of equation is the same , irrespective of the choice of the value @xmath9 .",
    "we might say , in other words , that @xmath11 is as good an invariant measure as the uniform measure @xmath17 is .",
    "there is however an essential difference here , which is that @xmath17 is the natural invariant measure for the fair coin tossings . for @xmath18",
    ", @xmath11 is in fact a singular measure , which can be thought of as a singular lebesgue function @xcite . using the isomorphism between fair coin tossings and the angle - doubling map , @xmath19",
    ", it is a simple exercise to identify @xmath11 with the measure lifted on the corresponding cylinder sets of the unit interval , whose cumulant @xmath20)$ ] is the unique function @xmath21 satisfying @xmath22 except for @xmath23 , for which @xmath24 , @xmath25 is strictly increasing and continuous , but has zero derivatives almost everywhere with respect to the lebesgue measure @xcite .",
    "a specific example is shown in .",
    "notice however that @xmath11 is in fact the natural invariant measure of the biased coin tossing which gives probability @xmath9 to heads and @xmath12 to tails .",
    "its cumulant corresponds to a uniform measure , which can be identified as the solution of the more general functional equation @xmath26 setting @xmath27 indeed yields @xmath28 . on the other hand ,",
    "the function @xmath29 , illustrated in , is of the lebesgue singular type and arises as the cumulant of the natural invariant measure of a dissipative baker map , projected along the contracting direction @xcite .",
    "though equation is a functional equation characterizing a probability measure , it is not in itself restricted to real values of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the uniqueness of its solutions is indeed warranted for every complex parameter @xmath9 such that @xmath30 @xcite . in such cases the solutions of equation",
    "are self - similar sets on the complex plane and it is a simple calculation to show that their hausdorff dimension is the solution @xmath31 of the following equation @xcite , @xmath32 a graphical representation of its solution is shown in .     defined through equation . ]",
    "note in particular that the parameter values @xmath33 , @xmath34 , define a circle of complex parameters such that the dimension is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "curves with parameters whose values lie inside that circle have hausdorff dimension between @xmath6 and @xmath36 .",
    "curves with parameters which verify the conditions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , but which lie outside that circle have hausdorff dimension @xmath36 @xcite    as shown by tasaki and collaborators @xcite , the functions @xmath25 with complex parameter @xmath39 with @xmath2 a real number such that @xmath40 , occur as representations of the left eigenvectors of the frobenius - perron operator of an expanding piecewise linear map of the real line related to the angle - doubling map",
    ".    the same curves also occur as special cases of hydrodynamic modes of diffusion , associated with multi - baker maps on a ring @xcite , where @xmath2 is the associated wavenumber .",
    "the dynamics is defined according to @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are understood to be taken modulo @xmath44 . given an initial distribution , the relaxation of statistical ensembles to the uniform equilibrium measure takes place exponentially fast at rate @xmath45 and is best characterized in terms of the cumulant measure @xmath46,[0,y])$ ] of phase points @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , after @xmath50 iterations : @xmath51,[0,y ] ) = \\sum_k a_k \\cos^t(k ) f_k(y ) e^{\\imath k",
    "n } ,    \\label{hydromodes}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are the wavenumbers , the coefficients @xmath54 are set by the initial distribution , and @xmath55 are solutions of the system of equations with the choice of parameter , @xmath56 , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath57 the dimension of these curves can be computed explicitly @xcite : @xmath58    in particular , for @xmath59 , we obtain a curve of hausdorff dimension @xmath60 which covers positive areas of the plane and corresponds to the levy dragon @xcite . another remarkable value of the parameter is @xmath61 , for which we have the dimension @xmath62 .",
    "these two curves are displayed in .    in the context of hydrodynamic modes of diffusion @xcite",
    ", the complex curves defined by equation acquire a clear physical meaning , which comes about when the parameter @xmath2 in is small : @xmath63 .",
    "the hausdorff dimension then becomes @xcite @xmath64 which provides a relation between the hausdorff dimension of the hydrodynamic modes , the diffusion coefficient of the process and the positive lyapunov exponent of the underlying dynamics .",
    "furthermore , considering the functional equation , we obtain the equivalent of a gradient expansion for @xmath55 @xcite ,    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the takagi function @xcite , which can be defined through the functional equation : @xmath67 see .    the result",
    "should be compared with that of hata and yamaguti @xcite , who recover the takagi function as the derivative of the curves @xmath25 , equation , with respect to their parameter , @xmath68 .",
    "the levy dragon shown in is but one example in a long list of popular fractal curves which are most often defined recursively through iterated function systems @xcite or using @xmath69-systems @xcite .",
    "the von koch curve @xcite and the heighway dragon , popularized in martin gardner s _ mathematical games _",
    "@xcite , are two other similar examples . in analogy with equation , it is simple to identify linear contractions which generate these sets @xcite .",
    "the solutions of equation with complex parameters produce a family of curves somewhat similar to the levy dragon . looking at the iterative construction of these solutions , we start from the initial line segment joining @xmath70 and @xmath71 and obtain @xmath72 . at the next iteration , we add the two points @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the result on the complex plane is a collection of two isosceles triangles whose long edges correspond to the two smaller edges of the triangle formed by the three initial points @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the next iteration produces four smaller isosceles triangles which are stacked upon the small edges of the two existing ones .",
    "a similar construction , which consists of stacking up the triangles alternatively upwards and downwards from one iteration to the next , as shown in , produces curves similar to the von koch curve .",
    "they are most easily obtained as the self - similar sets associated with a linear contraction similar to equation , but that further involves complex conjugation : @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the complex conjugation .",
    "equations and share the same real solutions but have different sets of solutions for complex parameter values .",
    "nonetheless they share the same hausdorff dimension .",
    "as pointed out by de rham @xcite , the choice @xmath80 produces the von koch curve .    taking the parameter @xmath9 as defined by equation",
    ", we write @xmath81 , for which we have the functional equation : @xmath82 as illustrated in , the choice of parameter @xmath61 corresponds to the von koch curve .",
    "for @xmath59 we obtain a peano - like curve .    as such",
    ", the functional equation is different from equation so its solutions do not correspond to hydrodynamic modes of the dyadic multi - baker map .",
    "it is however straightforward to see that they are the hydrodynamic modes associated with the four - adic map , @xmath83 with wavenumbers halved .",
    "note that the iterative construction of the von koch curve using a four - adic process amounts to skipping every odd step in the dyadic - based iterative construction shown in .",
    "the former is often preferred over the latter in the literature , see for instance @xcite , even though the dyadic representation based on equation is indeed the most compact .    the heighway dragon and related curves can also be obtained through functional equations similar to equation .",
    "they are based upon iterative constructions which combine both upwards and downwards triangles , as shown in .",
    "the heighway dragon is in fact a particular case of a hydrodynamic mode of a dyadic map similar to the multibaker map , where the angle - doubling map is replaced by the tent map @xmath84 if @xmath85 and @xmath86 if @xmath87 , namely @xmath88 note that the tent map here appears upside down along the expanding direction .",
    "this choice of combination of maps along the @xmath89 and @xmath90 coordinates is taken so the map has the property of being time reversal symmetric under the induction @xmath91 , which is also the case of the multi - baker map .",
    "another such map , very similar to equation , is @xmath92 here the usual tent map acts along the expanding direction . for the sake of our argument",
    "however , we prefer using since the tent map appears along the contracting direction under the time - evolution of phase - space densities .",
    "using , for the evolution of statistical ensembles under , an expansion similar to equation , we identify the modes @xmath93 the value @xmath59 yields the heighway dragon , as shown in .",
    "the map produces modes which can be obtained from equation by a simple symmetry .    finally , by analogy with equation",
    ", we obtain another set of associated fractals by complex conjugating the function on the right - hand side of the functional equation , @xmath94 examples of solutions are shown in . here again these curves can be identified as the hydrodynamic modes of a four - adic map .",
    "the above considerations are not limited to dyadic processes . consider for instance the iterated systems shown in    the functional equations whose solutions reproduce these familiar curves are based upon triadic processes : @xmath95 equation defines the hydrodynamic modes of diffusion of the triadic multi - baker map @xcite .",
    "equations and correspond , on the other hand , to the hydrodynamic modes of nine - adic multi - baker maps associated with random walks with assigned probabilities @xmath96 to jump by two units to the left or right , @xmath97 by a single unit , and @xmath98 to remain put .",
    "notice in particular that equation produces the sierpinski gasket @xcite for @xmath99 , as shown in .",
    "further examples of piecewise linear maps and their associated eigenstates can be found in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , tasaki and gaspard showed that the takagi function describes the non - equilibrium stationary state of a multi - baker map , and used its properties to show that this system obeys fick s law , which provides an expression of the mass current as minus the product of the mass density gradient and diffusion coefficient .",
    "this result thus provided a derivation of a phenomenological law of thermodynamics in terms of the phase - space dynamics of the model , which subsequently lead gaspard to identify the fractality of the non - equilibrium stationary states as the source of entropy production @xcite .",
    "a recent survey of these results with further extensions can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have presented some of these results in the more general context of fractal curves and self - similar sets defined by linear contractions , and emphasized their connections with the statistical properties of maps that generate the associated functional equations .",
    "shuichi tasaki contributed in important ways to our understanding the connection between singular functions and the statistical properties of @xmath0-adic maps .",
    "we are deeply saddened that we are not able to talk to shuichi about the excursion into the world of fractals described here . we know that we would have learned still more about them , and benefited from his careful and clear explanations ."
