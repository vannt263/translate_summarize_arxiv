    "<S> we examine the effect of spin - orbit coupling on the scattering of conduction electrons , by using the green s function method , for the s - d hamiltonian , with employing a decoupling procedure . as a result </S>",

    "<S> the kondo temperature @xmath1 is estimated from a singularity of green s functions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath1 is reduced as the spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath2 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath3 is comparable to or greater than @xmath4 , @xmath1 shows an abrupt decrease as a result of the band splitting . </S>",
