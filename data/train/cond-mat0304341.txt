    "utilizing feshbach resonance physics , recent experiments have produced an atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) coherently coupled to molecules in high vibrationally excited bound states @xcite .",
    "the coupling of atomic and molecular states was achieved through application of a pulsed external magnetic field and it has sparked much interest @xcite since it ultimately ( although possibly not yet ) should lead to the creation of a molecular condensate .",
    "the problem of creating a molecular bec has been one of the focus areas of ultracold physics research for several years now @xcite .",
    "two different techniques , namely photoassociation and a magnetic field ramp near a feshbach resonance , have been used in attempts to transform an atomic condensate into a molecular one .",
    "the use of feshbach resonances to control the atom - atom scattering length , and other properties , has been previously demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "it was predicted theoretically @xcite that magnetic field pulses would drive a significant part of an atomic bec into a molecular one .",
    "these predictions were based on a mean field theory approach , of the same type that has proven very successful in describing many properties of the alkali atom becs produced experimentally to date .",
    "however , two sets of experiments performed at jila have shown puzzling results that did not match the original theoretical predictions . in one experiment ,",
    "a single magnetic pulse close to the feshbach resonance probed the strongly interacting atomic dynamics , @xcite while in a second experiment double pulses generated interference patterns between the different states populated . in both experiments , the atoms , part of the initial bec cloud ,",
    "were observed to end up in one of the following three components : a remnant bec cloud , a burst of hot atoms , and a missing ( undetected ) component .",
    "this outcome differed from the theoretical predictions which only accounted directly for two components .",
    "the questions regarding the nature of the three components observed experimentally , including the specific issue of whether a molecular bec was created , were addressed by two independent theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "both of these papers accounted for many body effects by employing field theory beyond the mean field ( i.e. , gross - pitaevskii equation ) level .",
    "these two studies gave similar answers , in identifying the observed atom bursts as hot , non - condensed atoms , and the missing component as a molecular condensate .",
    "in addition to refs . @xcite and @xcite , three other theoretical studies involving many - body approaches",
    "have also addressed the interpretation of the donley _",
    "_ experiment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative model that does not rely on field theory .",
    "our model considers only two - body dynamics and uses a very simple scaling procedure to apply our results to the many - body system studied experimentally .",
    "the observed oscillatory behavior can then be viewed as a simple example of quantum beats of the type that arise whenever indistinguishable quantum mechanical pathways associated with two or more impulsively - excited stationary states interfere coherently.@xcite specifically , our treatment considers two atoms confined by a spherically symmetric harmonic oscillator potential , which interact through a contact potential .",
    "the stationary states of such a system have been described by busch _",
    "_ , @xcite who proposed it as a model that can be used in the context of ultracold collisions occuring in trapped gases .",
    "the properties of this treatment were further investigated in the context of the condensed bose gases by julienne and coworkers @xcite and by blume and greene @xcite .",
    "these papers investigated the strong interactions that occur near a feshbach resonance , and employed an energy - dependent scattering length to model this situation . here",
    "we implement this model for a time - dependent magnetic field , augmented by the sudden approximation to model the rapid field ramps .    by performing a frequency rescaling ,",
    "an initial condensate density can be achieved for two bodies that is comparable to the density range studied experimentally .",
    "the premise of our model is that the energy scale of the trap energy levels is very low in present day experiments , far smaller than the molecular binding energies of interest . at the same time",
    ", we anticipate that the physics of any single molecule formation is controlled by the interaction of just two atoms , even in a many - atom condensate .",
    "accordingly , we consider just two atoms in an oscillator trap of very high frequency , adjusted so that the density of the two atoms becomes the same as the condensate density in the experiments .",
    "the resulting approach is then used to model the recent experimental results of donley _",
    "our two - body model is shown to describe most of the nontrivial features observed in the experiment , although some discrepancies remain .",
    "this may indicate that a more elaborate inclusion of the many - body effects may be necessary to achieve a full quantitative description .",
    "nevertheless , our results show that more of the key effects can be interpreted in terms of two - body physics than appears to have been realized in existing theoretical models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 determines the eigenstates of two trapped atoms using a quantum - defect - style method that differs from the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite but is equivalent .",
    "section 3 discusses the behavior of the atom pair close to a feshbach resonance , and our approximate solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation using the sudden approximation .",
    "section 4 discusses the frequency rescaling employed to interpret the many - atom system .",
    "section 5 compares the results of our model with recent experiments , while section 6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we consider two atoms of mass @xmath0 in a spherical oscillator trap of angular frequency @xmath1 , which interact through a zero - range potential @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the two - body atom - atom scattering length and @xmath5 is the relative coordinate of the two particles .",
    "the hamiltonian of the two - body system separates into a center of mass part and a relative part .",

    "whereas in our model the `` hot '' atoms at the end of the pulse can be created through any of the three intermediate states ( i.e , molecules , condensed atoms or non - condensed atoms ) , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the `` hot '' atoms are solely the results of the `` rogue dissociation '' of intermediate molecular states .",
    "our approach suggests that around half of the final hot atoms are not produced by rogue dissociation .",

    "this may in fact be the additional loss mechanism that is cited as being `` missing '' in ref .",
    "we have investigated the results given by a simple model of the dynamics of two trapped atoms near a feshbach resonance .",
    "our model accounts for the interaction between the two atoms using a zero range potential and it also includes the confinement of the atoms by an external harmonic trap . this model can be used to make predictions regarding atomic bose condensate driven with the help of magnetic fields near a feshbach resonance , if a rescaled frequency is used to achieve a density comparable to the density of the many - atom condensates studied experimentally .",
    "a correspondence can be drawn between the three components observed in the recent field - ramp experiments and three groups of two - body states in our model .",
    "the experimentally - observed burst of hot atoms appears in our model as atom pairs excited to states energetically higher than the trap ground state level .",
    "the two - atom model is able to predict the populations of these three states , in fair agreement with the experimental observations . accordingly",
    "this may provide a useful alternative view of the physics of coherent atom - molecule coupling in a condensate .",
    "the success of a two - body description may initially seem surprising , because the dominant physical processes occurring in condensate experiments near a feshbach resonance are normally viewed as being inherently many - body in nature .",
    "nevertheless , the present study suggests that a two - body picture , with minimal modifications , is sufficiently realistic to be used for simple estimates at a qualitative or semiquantitative level .",
