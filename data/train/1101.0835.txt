    "it is now widely accepted that approximately 23 @xmath0 of the universe s energy density consists of non - baryonic cold dark matter @xcite . a large number of experiments consisting of direct , indirect and accelerator searches are currently underway all hoping to discover the underlying , presumably massive ( @xmath1 gev -tev ) , weakly interacting dark matter particle ( wimp ) .",
    "the lightest neutralino in supersymmetric models with conserved matter parity is a particularly attractive cold dark matter candidate and has attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "the direct detection searches have already yielded important constraints on the spin independent neutralino - nucleon cross sections in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm ) and some related models ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "indirect wimp searches rely on the capture and subsequent annihilation , say in the sun s center , of relic dark matter particles .",
    "the neutralinos , in particular , can annihilate into the known sm particles , for example , @xmath2 .",
    "the tau particles in turn produce energetic muon neutrinos which interact with the polar ice to produce muons which can be identified by the @xmath3 icecube / deep core detector @xcite .",
    "neutralinos in the galactic halo passing through a massive body like the sun can get captured if they scatter off the nuclei with velocities smaller than the escape velocity . in the core of the sun , where they eventually accumulate",
    ", these neutralinos can annihilate into known sm particles , for e.g. , @xmath2 .",
    "these particles decay ( e.g. @xmath4 ) and produce energetic muon neutrinos which can then be detected at icecube after they interact with the polar ice and produce muons ( for e.g. via processes like @xmath5 , n being the nucleon and x some hadronic system ) .",
    "we investigate the possibility of detecting these energetic neutrinos by estimating the flux of muons that they induce .",
    "in addition to the well studied cmssm , we explore other well motivated models , namely , flipped su(5 ) , non - universal higgs models ( nuhm2 ) , and flipped su(5 ) with universal higgs masses at @xmath6 .",
    "the prospects for detecting this neutrino induced muon flux by the icecube / deepcore experiment is discussed .",
    "in this paper we are mainly interested in studying the implications of supersymmetric flipped su(5 ) models for indirect dark matter wimp searches , with the lightest neutralino being the dark matter candidate . flipped su(5 )",
    "has several distinct features which are not easily replicated in other guts such as su(5 ) and so(10 ) .",
    "for instance , the well - known doublet - triplet splitting problem is easily solved in flipped su(5 ) @xcite .",
    "primordial inflation with predictions for the cosmological parameters in good agreement with the 7 year wmap data are readily obtained , which in turn , lead to testable predictions for proton decay @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ framework ] ,",
    "following @xcite , we briefly describe the two flipped su(5 ) models under discussion .",
    "consistent with the underlying gauge group ( su(5 ) x u(1 ) ) , both classes of models work with non - universal gaugino masses .",
    "their difference stems from the non - universal soft scalar higgs masses employed in one of the models . in section [ flux - sd ]",
    "we review the calculations of the conversion factors relating the muon flux and spin dependent ( sd ) cross section in the icecube / deep core experiment .",
    "section [ procedure ] contains a description of the experimental constraints and the scanning procedure employed to generate the benchmark points .",
    "our predictions for the muon flux and sd cross section are presented in section [ sec : results ] , and the conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we are interested in estimating the neutrino induced muon fluxes from neutralino annihilations in the sun , with flipped su(5 ) ( fsu(5 ) ) boundary conditions imposed on the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) parameters at @xmath6 .",
    "more generally , we compare four distinct models , namely cmssm , nuhm2 , fsu(5 ) and fsu(5 ) with universal ssb higgs mass boundary condition ( fsu(5)-uh ) .",
    "we will briefly describe each model below .",
    "the cmssm @xcite has the following parameters at the @xmath6 : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) scalar masses , @xmath9 is the ssb gaugino mass , @xmath10 is the universal ssb trilinear scalar interaction ( with the corresponding yukawa coupling factored out ) , @xmath11 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two mssm higgs doublets , and the magnitude of @xmath12 , but not its sign , is determined by the radiative electroweak breaking ( rewsb ) condition .    whereas , universal scalar masses are motivated to suppress unwanted flavor changing neutral currents , the higgs mass parameters can be non - universal .",
    "the effects of this non - universality on the parameter space has been studied in models called non - universal higgs models ( nuhm ) @xcite .",
    "one of the types of these models called the nuhm2 has two additional parameters compared to the cmssm @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the ssb the mssm higgs mass@xmath16 term .",
    "the supersymmetric flipped su(5 ) ( fsu(5 ) ) model @xcite is based on the maximal subgroup @xmath17 of so(10 ) , and the sixteen chiral superfields per family of so(10 ) are arranged under @xmath18 as : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . here",
    "the subscripts refer to the respective charges under @xmath22 , and we follow the usual notation for the standard model ( sm ) particle content .",
    "the mssm electroweak higgs doublets @xmath23 and @xmath24 belong to @xmath25 and @xmath26 of su(5 ) , respectively .",
    "we will assume for simplicity that the soft mass@xmath16 terms , induced at @xmath27 through gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite , are equal in magnitude for the scalar squarks and sleptons of the three families .",
    "the asymptotic mssm gaugino masses , on the other hand , can be non - universal . due to the fsu(5 ) gauge structure",
    ", asymptotic @xmath28 and @xmath29 gaugino masses can be different from the @xmath30 gaugino mass . assuming so(10 ) normalization for @xmath22 , the hypercharge generator in fsu(5 ) is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the generators of su(5 ) and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we then have the following asymptotic relation between the three mssm gaugino masses : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote su(5 ) , @xmath22 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 gaugino masses respectively .",
    "the supersymmetric fsu(5 ) model thus has two independent parameters @xmath43 in the gaugino sector . in other words , in fsu(5 ) , by assuming gaugino non - universality , we increase by one the number of fundamental parameters compared to the cmssm    we will also consider both universal ( @xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 ) and non - universal ( @xmath44@xmath47@xmath46 ) soft scalar higgs masses in fsu(5 ) , using the notations for fsu(5)-uh and fsu(5 ) respectively .",
    "this would mean up to three additional parameters compared to the cmssm .",
    "this latter case , with one additional gaugino mass parameter and two soft scalar mass parameters , provides us with a compelling neutralino dark matter candidate for indirect and direct detection @xcite in the ongoing and future experiments .",
    "we use the ( @xmath48 ) parameterization to characterize non - universal soft scalar higgs masses rather than ( @xmath49 )",
    ". the fundamental parameters of our fsu(5 ) model are @xmath50 we will assume that @xmath51 .",
    "note that @xmath12 and @xmath52 are specified at the weak scale , whereas the other parameters are specified at @xmath27 .",
    "although not required , we will assume that the gauge coupling unification condition @xmath53 holds at @xmath27 in fsu(5 ) .",
    "such a scenario can arise , for example , from a higher dimensional theory @xcite after suitable choice of compactification .",
    "in this section we will review the calculation of the muon flux and spin dependent cross section and revisit the way the conversion factors between the two are calculated .",
    "the icecube collaboration @xcite has presented its results as a future bound on the muon flux from the sun .",
    "the bound was then converted to a bound on the spin dependent cross section by suitable conversion factors calculated in @xcite and also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the flux of neutrino induced muons from neutralino annihilation in the sun is given by @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the annihilation rate , _",
    "n _ is the target number density , and @xmath56 is the distance from the center of the sun to the detector . @xmath57 is the differential energy spectrum of the number of neutrinos from neutralino annihilation with the corresponding branching fractions @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is the threshold energy of the muon in the detector , @xmath60 is the muon range , @xmath61 is the survival probability for a muon , @xmath62 is the differential neutrino cross - section and @xmath63 is the oscillation probability for a neutrino of flavor @xmath64 to oscillate to flavor @xmath12 in the detector .",
    "the annihilation rate for the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in the center of the sun is given by @xmath65 @xmath66 is a measure of the time in which capture and annihilation equilibrate , @xmath67 is the capture rate , and @xmath68 parameterizes the annihilation rate of the wimps . for present wimp annihilation rate ,",
    "@xmath69 is the age of the sun , i.e. , @xmath70 years .",
    "the annihilation and capture rate are in equilibrium when @xmath71 , which implies @xmath72 since the capture rate is proportional to the spin dependent and spin independent cross sections , there would be a direct correlation between the flux and the sd cross section .",
    "the converted bound can not be trusted for models where the equilibrium condition is not satisfied .",
    "accurate expressions for the capture rate can be found in @xcite , while reference @xcite gives the approximate expressions .",
    "for the case of sd cross section , which occurs mainly on hydrogen and the form factor suppression is negligible , the capture rate in the sun can be written as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the neutralino - proton spin dependent cross section , @xmath75 is the dark matter velocity dispersion , @xmath76 is the local dark matter density , and @xmath77 is the kinematical suppression factor defined as @xmath78 with @xmath79 @xmath80 denotes the mean escape velocity from the sun .",
    "reference @xcite calculates accurate conversion factors including neutrino oscillations .",
    "here we take a simple example to see how the conversion factors are calculated to get the sd cross section from the muon flux . ignoring detector thresholds and taking the effective range of muons in the detector ,",
    "the rate of neutrino induced through going muons for the sun can be approximated as @xcite @xmath81 since the capture in the sun is mainly through spin dependent scattering , we can assume @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) to get a bound on the sd cross section .",

    "the quantity @xmath90 is the second moment of the neutrino spectrum of type @xmath64 from final state @xmath91 , scaled by the square of the injection energy @xmath92 of the annihilation products , and is given by @xmath93 the neutrino spectrum from the @xmath94 and @xmath95 channels can be taken as @xcite @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and @xmath102 with @xmath103 @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "note that improved functions for the spectra can be obtained by using programs like pythia . in fig.[fig:6 ] we show plots of the second moment of these functions .",
    "we take @xmath108 and only consider contributions of the hard channels @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in our plots we assume that only the @xmath94 channel contributes for @xmath109 , and the @xmath95 channel for @xmath110 .",
    "the second moments @xmath111 and @xmath112 for the @xmath94 and @xmath95 channels are obtained by inserting eqs .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the conversion factor we find is similar to the estimates made in @xcite without including neutrino oscillations .",
    "we will see later how the converted icecube / deepcore future bound for the sd cross section is changed once neutrino oscillations are included .",
    "neutrinos created from neutralino annihilations in the sun s center may experience oscillations and interactions ( neutral as well as charged ) in the sun .",
    "these and other factors , like the solar composition , can modify the flux observed by detectors on earth . on the other hand ,",
    "direct detection involves measuring the scattering cross section of neutralinos off of nuclei .",
    "the conversion of the limit obtained from indirect detection experiments thus involves several uncertainties @xcite .",
    "they include :    * uncertainties in the solar model .",
    "* gravitational effects of planets like jupiter .",
    "* form factors .",
    "* variations in local dark matter density and velocity distributions . * neutrino oscillations",
    ".    these uncertainties can affect the estimated muon flux and thereby the deduced cross section .",
    "gravitational affects from jupiter , for example , can reduce the estimated muon flux , whereas neutrino oscillations can enhance it .",
    "the form factor suppression is negligible for the case of spin dependent interaction since the capture in the sun mainly occurs through scattering on the hydrogen nuclei .",
    "all of the above listed affects can have implications for the particular particle physics model being investigated .",
    "the implications for our models are discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we use the package darksusy-5.0.5 @xcite to calculate the flux of neutrino induced muons from the sun .",
    "darksusy ( ds ) uses a local dark matter density of @xmath118 . from the three methods ds",
    "employs to calculate the relic density , we pick the one which includes coannihilations only if the mass difference between the lsp and nlsp is less than @xmath119 .",
    "we rescale the neutralino density to @xmath120 , for @xmath121 .",
    "this is done because the neutralino can not make up all of the dark matter in the galaxy halos if @xmath122 drops below 0.025 .",
    "although not required , we assume for simplicity , that the gauge coupling unification condition @xmath123 holds at @xmath6 for fsu(5 ) .",
    "darksusy-5.0.5 uses isajet 7.78 @xcite for renormalization group evolution ( rge ) running and the latter employs two loop mssm rges and defines @xmath124 to be the scale where @xmath125 . a few percent deviation from exact unification ( @xmath123 )",
    "can be attributed to unknown gut - scale threshold corrections  @xcite .",
    "the random scan is performed over the parameter space of cmssm ( @xmath38=@xmath37=@xmath128=@xmath9 , @xmath8=@xmath129=@xmath130 ) , fsu(5 ) , nuhm2 ( @xmath38=@xmath128 ) , and fsu(5 ) with universal soft higgs @xmath131 ( @xmath132=@xmath133 ) at @xmath6 . since the neutralino mass is sensitive to the gaugino masses , we manipulate the latter to obtain more allowed points in the parameter space .",
    "we take piece - wise intervals [ 0,10],[10,100 ] and [ 100,1000 ] for the gaugino masses ( in units of gev ) .",
    "the random points in each of these intervals are distributed logarithmically .",
    "these points were then combined with a uniform distribution of points on the interval [ 0,1000 ] , with the total number of points around a million , which enables us to obtain a sufficiently dense set of points for our plots .",
    "this is still not sufficient for fsu(5)-uh , so we perform a gaussian scan around the allowed points .",
