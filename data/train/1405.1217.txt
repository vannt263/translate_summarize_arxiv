    "<S> this is a follow - up of our previous article @xcite where we proved local stability estimates for a potential in a schrdinger equation on an open bounded set in dimension @xmath0 from the dirichlet - to - neumann map with partial data . </S>",
    "<S> the region under control was the penumbra delimited by a source of light outside of the convex hull of the open set . </S>",
    "<S> these local estimates provided stability of log - log type corresponding to the uniqueness results in caldern s inverse problem with partial data proved by kenig , sjstrand and uhlmann  @xcite . in this article , we prove the corresponding global estimates in all dimensions higher than three . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates are based on the construction of solutions of the schrdinger equation by complex geometrical optics developed in the anisotropic setting by dos santos ferreira , kenig , salo and uhlmann  @xcite to solve the caldern problem in certain admissible geometries .    </S>",
    "<S> [ section ] [ thm]proposition [ thm]lemma [ thm]corollary [ thm]definition    [ thm]remark    introduction the aim of this article is to complete our previous results on the stability of caldern s inverse problem with partial data . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we obtained local stability estimates of log - log type on a potential in a schrdinger equation from the dirichlet - to - neumann map with partial data in dimension three . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we could only control the potentials in the penumbra region delimited by a source of light located outside of the convex hull of the open set where the potentials were supported . </S>",
    "<S> it seems very likely that one could obtain global estimates by a continuation argument but in the gluing process , it might be difficult to avoid losing as many logarithms as there are steps , thus yielding very weak stability estimates .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof was based on the construction of solutions of the schrdinger equation by complex geometrical optics with nonlinear phases performed by kenig , sjstrand and uhlmann @xcite and the alternative final argument of the same authors with dos santos ferreira @xcite involving the radon transform . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates were thus derived in two steps :    * first , controlling the radon transform with restricted angle - distance data by the dirichlet - to - neumann map * then , controlling a function on some determined subset by this restricted radon transform .    both steps provided log - stability , which after combination yielded a log - log estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the second step was based on the observation that the qualitative microlocal analytic methods used in @xcite ( and in a slightly more involved way in @xcite ) could actually be transformed into quantitative estimates , and relied on the use of kashiwara s watermelon theorem . </S>",
    "<S> an observation that we still believe to be of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the microlocal nature of the argument ( also related to unique continuation ) partly explains the reason why one only obtains local estimates . besides </S>",
    "<S> , the restriction to dimension three was justified by the fact that in this case , the radon transform naturally comes in , whereas in higher dimensions , it is replaced by the two - plane transform , and that formulae relating the radon and the segal - bargmann transforms ( used in the microlocal arguments ) are straightforward .    in this paper , we choose a different path which directly yields global estimates and applies similarly to all dimensions higher than three . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the methods developped in @xcite ( and refined in @xcite ) to tackle the caldern problem on manifolds under certain geometric assumptions , and which also englobe part of the construction done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation has already been made by kenig and salo @xcite and is the starting point to improve uniqueness results in the inverse problem with partial data and to unify different approaches on the subject . like the predecessor of this article </S>",
    "<S> , the proof of the estimates decomposes into two parts involving this time the ( attenuated ) geodesic ray transform on the hemisphere , both yielding log - stability . </S>",
    "<S> the upgrade to global estimates is allowed because the information provided on the ray transform is not restricted to certain points and directions .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now describe the problem under scope and our results . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the schrdinger equation with bounded potential @xmath1 @xmath2 when @xmath3 is not a dirichlet eigenvalue of the schrdinger operator @xmath4 , the dirichlet - to - neumann map may be defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the exterior unit normal of @xmath7 and @xmath8 denotes the boundary of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a bounded operator @xmath9 in fact a first order pseudodifferential operator when @xmath10 and @xmath8 are smooth . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation relates to the conductivity equation involved in the caldern problem , at least for smooth enough conductivities , as observed by sylvester and uhlmann in @xcite . in combination with boundary determination obtained by kohn and vogelius @xcite this allowed sylvester and uhlmann to solve the caldern problem for twice continuously differentiable conductivities in dimension @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the formulation of the inverse problem with partial data is whether the dirichlet - to - neumann map @xmath12 measured on subsets of the boundary determines the electric potential @xmath10 inside @xmath7 . in dimension </S>",
    "<S> higher than three , the first results with partial data were obtained by bukhgeim and uhlmann @xcite but required measurements on roughly half of the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the first results which require measurements on small subsets of the boundary ( at least for strictly convex open sets @xmath7 ) were obtained by kenig , sjstrand and uhlmann @xcite . with the refinements and generalization recently obtained by kenig and salo @xcite , they are the most precise results so far in dimension  @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> let us describe the results of @xcite in more details . </S>",
    "<S> for that purpose , we introduce the front and back sets @xmath13 of @xmath14 with respect to a source @xmath15 outside the convex hull of @xmath14 ( see figure [ fig : frontback ] ) . recall that @xmath6 is the exterior unit normal . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of @xcite reads as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath7 be a bounded open set in @xmath16 with smooth boundary , let @xmath17 and consider two open neighbourhoods @xmath18 respectively of the front and back sets @xmath19 and @xmath20 of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath22 be two bounded potentials on @xmath7 , suppose that @xmath3 is neither a dirichlet eigenvalue of the schrdinger operator @xmath23 nor of @xmath24 , and that for all @xmath25 supported in @xmath26 , the two dirichlet - to - neumann maps coincide on @xmath27 @xmath28 then the two potentials agree @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of this article is to derive the corresponding stability estimates . </S>",
    "<S> stability estimates for the conductivity inverse problem go back to alessandrini s article @xcite . for the inverse problem with partial data , stability estimates corresponding to the results of bukhgeim and uhlmann were derived by heck and wang @xcite , and in the presence of a magnetic field by tzou @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , caro and salo proved in @xcite stability estimates for the caldern problem in certain anisotropic media following an approach quite similar to the one presented here . </S>",
    "<S> our previous article @xcite was , to the best of our knowledge , the first attempt to obtain stability estimates corresponding to the results of kenig , sjstrand and uhlmann , and only lacked its goal by the local nature of the estimates . to simplify the exposition of the derivation of our stability estimates </S>",
    "<S> , we only consider the case where the dirichlet - to - neumann maps are measured on the front set of @xmath7 but with test functions fully supported in the boundary ( instead of the back front set ) . </S>",

    "<S> let us begin by defining a partial dirichlet - to - neumann map ; let @xmath27 be an open neighbourhood of the front set @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath30 be a cutoff function supported in @xmath27 which equals @xmath31 on a neighbourhood of @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> we study the attenuated geodesic ray transform on a hemisphere ; the results are classical but given the plain context we choose a very explicit and pedestrian approach . </S>",
