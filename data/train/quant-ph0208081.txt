    "quantum superposition and its resulting interference are arguably the most fundamental effects in quantum mechanics , which leads to the concept of complementarity . in 1927 , bohr@xcite first reviewed this subject , claimed that the wave- and particle - like behaviors of a quantum mechanical object are mutually exclusive in a single experiment and expressed it as complementarity .",
    "so bohr complementarity is often superficially identified with the ` wave - particle duality'@xcite which emphasizes two extreme cases that each experiment must be described in terms of either waves or particles , as explained in the textbook .",
    "theoretical investigations about the intermediate situations in which particle and wave aspects coexist have led to some quantitative statements about wave - particle duality@xcite , some of which are expressed as inequalities @xmath8 or @xmath9 about the complementarity between ` which - way ' ( ww ) information of a particle : the predictability @xmath10 and the distinguishability @xmath11 of the path , and the visibility @xmath12 of interference fringes@xcite .",
    "bohr complementarity is often illustrated by means of interferometers and has been experimentally investigated in one - particle interferometer with individual particles , including photons@xcite , electrons@xcite , neutrons@xcite , atoms@xcite and nuclear spins in a bulk ensemble with nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques@xcite .",
    "complementarity , however , is a more general concept which states that quantum systems possess properties that are equally real but mutually exclusive .",
    "naturally , the techniques of standard one - particle interferometry have been extended to two - particle interferometry by employing correlated two - particle systems .",
    "the two - particle interference phenomenon was first observed by ghosh and mandel@xcite using photon pair produced by parametric down - conversion , where the nonclassical effects associated with einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) states were exhibited . since that",
    ", two - particle interferometry has been intensively studied theoretically and experimentally@xcite .",
    "whereafter , a fact between one- and two - particle interference was noticed by horne and zeilinger@xcite , i.e. , when the two - particle visibility is unity , the one - particle visibility is zero , and vice versa .",
    "the visibilities of the one- and two - particle interference are described as a pair of complementary quantities . a systematic investigation of intermediate cases",
    "was carried out by jaeger et al.@xcite , who showed that in a large family of states @xmath13 an interferometric complementarity holds between one - particle visibility @xmath14 and two - particle visibility @xmath15 : @xmath16 where the upper bound is saturated for a special family of states while most of the cases are limited in the inequality ( 1 ) .",
    "however , the condition of achieving the upper bound has not yet been pointed out .",
    "the complementarity relation of one- and two - photon interference has been experimentally demonstrated in a young s double - slit experiment by abouraddy et al.@xcite . except this experiment",
    ", we have not still found other experimental versions in the intermediate regime .",
    "moreover , inequality ( 1 ) can be strengthened to an equality with a suitable extension of operations on the pair of particles@xcite , but this conclusion is based on the different parameters of experimental configuration , that is , one can not observe such interference fringes to obtain @xmath14 and @xmath15 that satisfy the equality in practice@xcite .    then , what is the condition of this complementarity being of the form of an equality @xmath17 ? and what is the reason why the complementarity relation is restricted in the inequality ( 1 ) ? in this paper , we analyze the one- and two - particle interference complementarity in the general case and examine the relation among @xmath18 , @xmath4 and the predication of the path @xmath19 to obtain an equality : @xmath20 for any pure two - particle source , which gives the answers of the two questions above , and , in fact , embodies two interferometric complementarity relations whose relations are discussed .",
    "furthermore , we also clarify the relationships of @xmath21 the distinguishability of the path @xmath22 and the entanglement @xmath7 of the composite system which show an important view that this complementarity can arise due to the correlations . using nmr techniques detailed in our works@xcite",
    ", the one- and two - particle complementarity relation of @xmath23 with @xmath24 has been experimentally tested with the ensemble - averaged spin states of @xmath25c and @xmath26h nuclei in @xmath25c - labelled chloroform @xmath25chcl@xmath27 , including two extreme cases : perfect two - particle interference fringe and no one - particle interference fringe for an entangled state and the opposite for a product state , and an intermediate case of a special family of states , by measuring both single and joint probability densities of spin states .",
    "we briefly review some dinfinitions and two - particle interferometric complementarity in two extreme cases . a schematic arrangement for a two - particle interferometer with variable phase shifters",
    "is given in fig .",
    "the source s emits a pair of particles 1 + 2 , one of which propagates along the path a and/or a@xmath28 , through a variable phase shifter @xmath29 impinging on an ideal symmetric beam splitter bs@xmath30 , and is then registered in either beam @xmath31 or @xmath32 , while on the other side there is the analogous process on the other ( see fig .",
    "the locution `` and/or '' refers in a brief way to a quantum - mechanic superposition , the details of which are specified by the state of particles 1 + 2 .",
    "assuming that the pair of particles 1 + 2 are ideally two - level or spin-1/2 quantum entities , the hilbert space h@xmath30 associated with particle 1 is spanned by vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 representing states of propagation in the paths a and a@xmath28 , and the hilbert space h@xmath35 associated with particle 2 by analogous vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in the same way , the space of the output states is the subspaces spanned by the vectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 for particle 1 and by @xmath40 and @xmath41 for particle 2 .",
    "according to the standard definition of visibility @xmath42 , the usual definition for single - particle fringe visibility is @xmath43 _",
    "{ \\max } -\\left [ p\\left ( k_{i}\\right ) \\right ] _ { \\min } } { \\left [ p\\left ( k_{i}\\right ) \\right ] _ { \\max } + \\left [ p\\left ( k_{i}\\right ) \\right ]",

    "_ { \\min } } , \\ ] ] where the `` corrected '' joint probability @xmath45 to assure the reasonableness of the visibility @xmath46@xcite , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the probabilities of single and joint detections , respectively .",
    "these visibilities can be obtained by observing the variations of both single and joint probabilities as functions of the phases @xmath29 and @xmath49 . for simplicity ,",
    "our experiments take the case of @xmath50 and @xmath51 representing the single - particle states with spin - up and spin - down , respectively .",
    "consider two extreme cases@xcite : when particles 1 + 2 is prepared in an entangled state @xmath52 or in a product state @xmath53 \\otimes \\left [ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left ( \\left| \\uparrow \\right\\rangle _ { 2}+\\left| \\downarrow \\right\\rangle _ { 2}\\right ) \\right ] .\\ ] ] the joint action of variable phase shifters and symmetric beam splitters can be described by a unitary operation @xmath54 where @xmath55 and subscript @xmath56 represents particle @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the unitary mapping from the space of input states of the pair of particles 1 + 2 into the space of output states .",
    "it is easy to show that the joint and single measurement probabilities in the space of output states are : for the @xmath58 state of eq.(4 ) , @xmath59   \\\\   p\\left ( \\left| \\uparrow \\right\\rangle _ { 1}\\left| \\downarrow \\right\\rangle _ { 2}\\right ) = p\\left ( \\left| \\downarrow \\right\\rangle _ { 1}\\left| \\uparrow \\right\\rangle _ { 2}\\right ) = \\frac{1}{4}\\left [ 1-\\cos \\left ( \\phi _ { 1}+\\phi _ { 2}\\right ) \\right ]   \\\\   p\\left ( \\left| \\uparrow \\right\\rangle _ { 1}\\right ) = p\\left ( \\left| \\downarrow \\right\\rangle _ { 1}\\right ) = p\\left ( \\left| \\uparrow \\right\\rangle _ { 2}\\right ) = p\\left ( \\left| \\downarrow \\right\\rangle _ { 2}\\right ) = \\frac{1}{2 } \\end{array}\\ ] ] and for the @xmath60 state of eq.(5 ) , @xmath61 where @xmath62or@xmath63 . obviously , the probabilities of joint measurements in eqs.(8 ) exhibit cosinusoidal modulations via the variable phase @xmath64 which yields two - particle interference fringes for the entangled state @xmath58 , whereas there is no one - particle interference fringes .",
    "conversely , a cosinusoidal dependence of the single probabilities on the variable phase @xmath64 in eqs.(9 ) yields one - particle interference fringes for the product state @xmath65 , but no genuine two - particle fringes , in that the variation of the joint probability @xmath66 results only from the variations of the single probabilities @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "this is the reason for using the `` corrected '' definition for two - particle fringe visibility .",
    "further , eqs.(8 ) shows @xmath69 , a manifestation of quantum nonlocality associated with the entangled state @xmath58 . from the definitions of eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , the theoretical outcomes of the visibilities are found to be @xmath70 for @xmath58 and @xmath71 for @xmath60 .",
    "the phenomenon can also be partially explained via the spirit of the ` which - way ' ( ww ) interferometry experiment to test bohr complementarity : any attempt to gain ww information unavoidably destroys the interference pattern@xcite . for example , when the composite system of particles 1 + 2 is prepared in the entangled state @xmath58 , ww information of one particle is stored in the states of the other through their correlation .",
    "consequently , as far as a single particle ( 1 or 2 ) is concerned , there are full ww information and no one - particle fringes .",
    "however , for the pair of particles 1 + 2 , there is no way to determine whether 1 + 2 takes the composite path @xmath72 or the composite path @xmath73 , and hence perfect two - particle interference pattern displays .",
    "in contrast , if the system is in the product state @xmath74 it is impossible to determine the path of one particle through the other , and thus there is one - particle interference .",
    "now , we turn to the general case from two extreme @xmath75 and @xmath60 .",
    "the most general state of pure two - particle source 1 + 2 that can be formed from the basis of @xmath76 is @xmath77 where @xmath78 where @xmath79 are complex numbers .",
    "as the visibilities are independent of the phases @xmath80 , in our analysis , all of @xmath81 are taken to be real numbers@xcite .",

    "the maximal and minimal values of @xmath88 are deduced as : @xmath89 , which can be achieved only when @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 .",
    "hence , on substituting for the maximal and minimal values of these probabilities in eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) , one gets    @xmath92    and @xmath93 ^{2}\\leq 1,\\quad \\left ( i=1,2\\right ) .\\ ] ] the complementarity relation is achieved for any pure state of a composite two - particle system . in this type of interference experiments ,",
    "another interesting physical quantity is the ww information of one particle when the other serves as the ww maker .",
    "because the two complementarities  between path distinguishability and single - particle visibility and between one- and two - particle visibilities  are intimately connected , the one - particle visibility @xmath18 enters in the same way in both of them@xcite . without any measurement ,",
    "the available _ a priori _ ww knowledge of one particle is described by the predictability @xmath19 of the alternatives , which represents man s knowledge before measure ; while the distinguishability @xmath22 denotes the maximal information about the `` path '' that can be extracted from an appropriate measure , which is nature s information about the actual alternative ; usually @xmath94@xcite . for all pure states @xmath95 ,",
    "the complementarity of single particle@xcite @xmath96 holds , while @xmath97 where , by definition , the predictability @xmath19 of the path for particle _ i _ reads@xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 are the probabilities that particle @xmath56 takes one way @xmath100 or the other @xmath101 .",
    "comparing inequality ( 16 ) with eq.(19 ) , an equality @xmath102 is achieved , which gives the relation among three physical quantities : @xmath103 , @xmath4 and @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , eq.(20 ) covers both of two complementarity relations of inequalities ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) and implies the condition of saturating the upper bound of the two inequalities .",
    "for example , if the state of particle _",
    "i _ is prepared symmetrically ( @xmath104 ) so that @xmath24 , i.e. , there is nothing predictable about the paths in a symmetric one - particle counterpart , the one- and two - particle complementarity will be of the form of an equality . or otherwise , if particle _",
    "i _ is an asymmetric state ( @xmath105 ) , that is , one path is more likely than the other to begin with @xmath106 , the complementarity is strictly limited in the inequality ( 16 ) , because partial ww information @xmath19 restrains full one - particle interference visibility @xmath18 .",
    "as the complementarity is tightly associated with the property of the composite system , it would be natural to examine the relationships between these physical quantities and the entanglement @xmath7 of the system . by calculating the von neumann entropy@xcite",
    ", the entanglement @xmath7 for the pure state @xmath95 in eq.(10 ) goes as @xmath107 as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , this monotonically increasing relation between the two - particle visibility @xmath4 and the entanglement @xmath7 indicates the visibility of two - particle interference fringes @xmath4 is entirely governed by the entanglement @xmath7 of pure two - particle source : the absence of entanglement will results in zero - visibility two - particle interference fringes ( e.g. , the @xmath60 state in eq.(5 ) , @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) , and the prefect entanglement , the full two - particle interference fringes ( e.g. , the @xmath58 state in eq.(4 ) , @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) . from eq.(21 ) one can not directly make out clear relations between @xmath18 or @xmath22 and @xmath7 . however , from eq.(20 ) and eq.(17 ) , @xmath112 is gained , which means that @xmath22 contains both of the _ a priori _ ww information @xmath19 and the additional information @xmath4 encoded in the entanglement between the object and the ww maker due to the entire determination of @xmath4 by @xmath7 .",
    "since _ a priori _ knowledge @xmath19 only lies on the feature of initial single subsystem rather than that of the composite system , these quantities can be studied with a given _ a priori _ ww knowledge @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , in a relevant symmetric one - particle interferometer @xmath113 , then @xmath114 and @xmath115 , which tie up with the entanglement @xmath7 ( see fig.2 ) : the entanglement @xmath7 is enhanced , more and more nature s ww information is stored in the states of the marker particle through their correlation so that @xmath22 rises whereas the one - particle visibility decreases , as discussed and experimentally testified in ref .",
    "most of one - particle interference experiments@xcite are discussed in this kind of symmetric interferometer . if the interferometer begins with @xmath106 , @xmath18 and @xmath116 still bear the similar dependence on the entanglement @xmath7 , this monotonically decreasing relation for @xmath18 and this monotonically increasing relation for @xmath22 except for the wholly alterative amplitudes based on _ a priori _ knowledge @xmath19 , while @xmath4 does not alter the relation on @xmath7 at all .",
    "consequently , this figure also illuminates an important view that quantum correlation is completely responsible for complementarity .    in order to discuss these relations in greater detail , we study some special families of states .",
