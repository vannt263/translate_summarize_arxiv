    "<S> in what are known as _ metaphase _ and the subsequent _ anaphase _ , when chromosomes are separated , the eukaryotic nucleus is spanned by the mitotic spindle , consisting of an intricate network of protein filaments , microtubules ( mts ) , self - organized to originate from nucleating centers and terminate either at connections to the chromosomes or in an anti - parallel alignment in the spindle mid - zone . </S>",
    "<S> this filament network is both stabilized and driven by specialized motor proteins that slide antiparallel microtubules relative to one another , converting the chemical energy of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) to mechanical work and motion . at the same time , the mts are themselves dynamic and their incessant polymerization and depolymerization can also introduce non - equilibrium forces into the spindle  @xcite , although these forces are not directly atp - dependent . </S>",

    "<S> this approach has the powerful advantages of allowing unambiguous discrimination between true spindle length fluctuations , which are the quantities of interest here , and out of plane spindle excursions ; by virtue of the 3d imaging and high resolution ; and segregation of bipolar spindle cells , and specifically those in metaphase , from a population of normally - growing cells , without resorting to addition of a drug to stall growth in one phase of the cell cycle . </S>",
    "<S> the rotationally invariant measure @xmath8 is immune to any advection of the whole cell or of the microscope stage , or of the entire nucleus , and to instability of the focal plane and other such physical artefacts that are possible contaminants of fine measurements of individual locus motions .    </S>",
    "<S> we observed typically 12 - 15 cells per field of view ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : invivo_system_methmat ] ( c ) ) , from which 2 - 3 cells were in metaphase over the 20 minute observation window . </S>",

    "<S> the data show fluctuations in @xmath8 during metaphase that are easily distinguishable above the 3d resolution in the position localization .    </S>",
    "<S> to explore these fluctuations in the metaphase cells spindles , we collected the @xmath8 data for a population of cells , and from the fluctuations of @xmath8 we calculated the displacement power spectral density ( psd ) by fast fourier transform  @xcite . as the power spectral density analysis assumes uniformly spaced time series , we excluded cells that lacked the position for a single time point of either pole . in all , 25 cells were included in the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the psd data for cells are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : psd ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ensemble - averaged power spectrum shows an approximate power - law behavior in frequency @xmath9 , with the psd@xmath10  at low frequency , although the data can not be captured by a single power - law throughout the experimental range . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be understood by a variation of models for active diffusion in eukaryotic cells  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , our observations are consistent with uncorrelated active force fluctuations driving motion in a viscoelastic medium  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such uncorrelated force fluctuations are expected for the long time - scales of our experiments . </S>",
    "<S> correlations can arise , for instance , from the _ processivity _ or coherent motion of molecular motors or microtubule polymerization and depolymerization . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency range we observe corresponds to time - scales ( @xmath11s ) that are longer than the correlation time of either of these processes ( @xmath12s )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the active forces should be uncorrelated  @xcite and the force spectrum should be white . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to thermal driving forces that must be correlated in viscoelastic systems , as a consequence of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite . in a medium with power - law rheology given by @xmath13 , the thermal msd@xmath14 , corresponding to a psd@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , for white noise force spectrum , the msd@xmath16 and the psd@xmath17 . for more </S>",
    "<S> a general frequency - dependent modulus @xmath18 , when driven by a force @xmath19 , the frequency - dependent displacement @xmath20 should vary inversely with the stiffness of the matrix : @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for white noise driving , the power spectrum of position fluctuations @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been very few reports of directly measured nuclear rheology in living cells , and none for the cells we study here . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the fluctuations of the nuclear envelope labelled of a nuclear pore complex protein , do not account for the relaxation spectrum ( data not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> to investigate the viscoelastic environment in the nucleus , we created an _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> model system of bare chromosomes at a dna density comparable to the nuclear environment . </S>",
    "<S> we then performed passive microrheology measurements  @xcite on this model system . </S>",
    "<S> the model system consisted of @xmath23 @xmath24-dna ( 48,502 b.p . ) in physiological salt conditions . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the dna is well above the semi - dilute limit  @xcite and can be considered an entangled polymer network . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24-dna ( new england biolabs ) was concentrated by ethanol precipitation then resuspended in buffer ( 10 mm tris - hcl , ph 7.9 , 50 mm nacl , 50 mm kcl , 5 mm @xmath25 , 0.1 mm edta , and 15 mg / l bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) ) at the desired concentration , with slow mixing . </S>",
    "<S> concentration was measured using a nd-1000 nanodrop in serial dilutions with accuracy of @xmath26 error on the mean in 6 measurements . </S>",
    "<S> latex microspheres of @xmath27 radius ( polysciences ) were incorporated in the sample for microrheology . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was imaged on a leica dm - irb inverted microscope in brightfield mode using a 63x 1.4 na oil immersion objective lens using a ccd camera ( hamamatsu ) at 16 fps for 5 min . </S>",
    "<S> data obtained for multiple fields of view were analyzed separately and combined .    </S>",
    "<S> the frequency - dependent viscoelastic moduli obtained from this approach are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : invitro ] , with the relevant frequency range for the _ in vivo _ measurements highlighted . </S>",
    "<S> the measured rheology over the lowest frequency range is approximated by @xmath28 , which is close to the zimm behavior expected for flexible polymer solutions  @xcite . among the very few reports to date of nuclear rheology measurements on living cells , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite measured @xmath18 of nuclei of human stem and differentiated cells . when these authors studied cells deficient in nuclear lamins , which are not present in our yeast cells , they found results consistent with the @xmath28 that we find in our reconstituted system . </S>",
    "<S> as noted above , the full frequency dependence of the psd for active driving should follow @xmath29 . for the @xmath18 measured in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : invitro ] , this frequency dependence is in excellent agreement with our measured fluctuation spectrum in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : psd ] , as shown by the solid black line . here </S>",
    "<S> , we do not know the overall strength of active fluctuations , which should depend on such variables as the density and force level of active processes . </S>",
    "<S> so , only the amplitude ( vertical position in the log - log plot ) has been adjusted , and there are no further free parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the implied force fluctuations in this picture are far from what is expected thermally . for a continuum viscoelastic medium characterized by a complex modulus @xmath18 , the displacement psd for a particle of radius @xmath30 is given by @xmath31  @xcite , for which the force spectrum should be proportional to @xmath32 . in general , this represents a colored spectrum . for instance , the approximate @xmath33 indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : invitro ] would correspond to a thermal force spectrum @xmath34 , which is obviously very different from the expected active , white spectrum . for a more direct comparison with our measured psd </S>",
    "<S> , we also show on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : psd ] the thermal psd of probe particles in our _ in vitro _ reconstituted dna solution . here , too </S>",
    "<S> , the overall amplitude is not known , and a single multiplicative factor has been adjusted for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the data clearly identify quantitative differences between active and thermal driving . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the latter does not account for the psd _ in vivo _ suggests that the active driving is dominant and has a different time / frequency dependence than thermal , unless the rheology of the nucleus is very different from our _ in vitro _ model . </S>",
    "<S> but , in any case , for viscoelastic media such as dna solutions , the active and thermal psd of fluctuations are very unlikely to be the same  @xcite : one implication of the fluctuation dissipation theorem is that the thermal forces in such media must be characterized by a broad spectrum of characteristic timescales , in contrast with such active processes as the motion of molecular motors that exhibit a well - defined processivity time .    </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that position fluctuations within the nucleus of cells can be fully accounted for by a simple model of a viscoelastic medium , whose response is dominated by a solution of uncondensed dna , driven by de - correlated active force fluctuations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one consequence of such active force fluctuations would be enhanced transport relative to thermal fluctuations , at least over a range of time scales of order seconds .    while the fact that fluctuations in the nucleus on such time scales are non - thermal may not necessarily be surprising in itself , the nature of activity within the nucleus remains almost entirely unknown . in this system , </S>",
    "<S> the two most likely sources of activity are molecular motors and ( de)polymerization forces due to assembly / disassembly of microtubules . in order to test for the former </S>",
    "<S> , we individually suppressed each of the two microtubule - associated motors known to be important here : this organism has two types of kinesin-5 tetrameric motors , the proteins kip1 and cin8 , that can generate outward - directed forces by sliding antiparallel microtubules with respect to each other . </S>",
    "<S> when we remove either of these using complete deletion of the gene , we find no statistically significant change in the observed spectrum ( see figure 1s in esi ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that neither of these motors can be _ solely _ </S>",
    "<S> responsible for the observed fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible , unfortunately , to knock out both motors simultaneously ( though such a scenario can be achieved by temperature - sensitive mutants ) _ and still have an intact ( non - collapsed ) metaphase spindle _ , as these motors are known to play a crucial role in stabilizing the spindle structure  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent work has focused on the mechanisms by which kip1 and cin8 motors perform their multiple mitotic roles and their regulation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phosphoregulation of the mt - bundler ase1 by the cdk1 kinase and the cdc14 phosphatase ( which reverses the activity of the kinase ) controls the timing of cin8 physical association with the mid - zone  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ase1 protein crosslinks mid - zone mts for spindle elongation , and keeps the two half spindles connected throughout elongation . in metaphase , </S>",
    "<S> ase1 is sustained in the phosphorylated state by cdk1 , and in this state inhibits accumulation of cin8 on imts which prevents premature elongation and collapse of the metaphase spindle . during the transition to anaphase </S>",
    "<S> , ase1 is dephosphorylated , and both the bundling protein and the kinesin-5 cin8 associate more strongly with the newly - stable antiparallel imt scaffold , indicating that these two ( and presumably additional ) proteins work co - operatively to regulate and drive spindle elongation . </S>",
    "<S> khmelinskii _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , have shown that the ase1 protein exponentially increases the rate at which cin8 binds to the imts at the mid - zone , while fridman _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ have shown that kip1 is concentrated at the mid - zone only when spindles elongate in anaphase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> motor efficiency for extensile driving thus increases dramatically at the onset of anaphase . during metaphase </S>",
    "<S> the motors play primarily a structural role and appear to be non - processive . </S>",
    "<S> our finding that the perturbations shown in the supporting material do not alter the psd during metaphase is consistent with this picture .    in order to test for active , possibly non - motor processes , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to deplete the cell of atp by treating the cells with both sodium azide , a well - known metabolic inhibitor that switches off atp production in the mitochondria , and 2-deoxyglucose , which inhibits glycolysis . </S>",
    "<S> together , these suppress motor activity more generally  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when we do this , we also see no statistically significant change in the observed spectrum . however , these metabolic poisons are known to incompletely deplete atp  @xcite and they are even less effective in depleting gtp  @xcite . we conclude that the active fluctuations in our system most likely come from microtubule ( de)polymerization forces , which do not depend directly on atp . however </S>",
    "<S> , testing this will require more direct methods for micro - mechanical characterization in the nucleus , which remains highly challenging .    </S>",
