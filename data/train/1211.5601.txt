    "massive black holes ( mbhs ) , with masses ranging from some @xmath1 to a few @xmath2 are very likely present in the centre of most galaxies . measurements of the kinematics of gas and stars in the central regions of nearby galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have provided us with compelling evidence .",
    "our own milky way ( mw ) is the galaxy for which we have the strongest observational proof a central mbh .",
    "data based on 16 years of observations set the mass of the central smbh to @xmath3 @xcite .    to interact with the central mbh",
    ", stars have to find themselves on `` loss - cone '' orbits , which are orbits elongated enough to have a very close - in pericentre @xcite . while main - sequence stars are tidally disrupted when approaching the central massive black hole ( mbh ) , compact objects ( stellar black holes , neutron stars , and white dwarfs ) slowly spiral into the mbh via the gradual loss in the form of gravitational radiation and are eventually swallowed after some @xmath4 orbits in the elisa band@xcite .",
    "this is the best way to probe general relativity @xcite and , thus , the factory of space and time around a massive black hole",
    ". we will also get additional information about the binary itself : in particular the masses of the system and the spins of the mbh can be measured to a level of precision without any precedent ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "besides , the detection will provide us with information about the distribution of dark objects in galactic nuclei and globular clusters .",
    "producing emris is more difficult than producing tidal disruptions of stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) because while disruptions require a single passage within a critical radius , an emri is a progressive phenomenon that is only successful if the small compact object suffers a large number of close encounters with the central mbh .",
    "the requirement for an emri to be successful is not just to have a small periapsis , but that the gravitational radiation timescale is sufficiently shorter than 2-body relaxation , which could have a significant impact on the periapsis .",
    "although the basic ideas are explained in detail in the recent review of @xcite , we deem it important to briefly summarize in the next paragraphs the fundamentals of the ideas of two different categories of emris , since this will be crucial to understand the main results of this paper .    in a galactic nucleus without",
    "dissipation processes a star suffers `` gravitational tugs '' in the regime where the evolution is dominated by close encounters with other stars .",
    "these tugs , since they are driven by two - body relaxation , are _ random _ and originated by interacting with other stars that happen to have a very close position .",
    "the scattering rate is very similar in orbital energy @xmath5 and angular momentum @xmath6 .",
    "if the star gets close to a very low @xmath6 , which is statistically probable , then the picture changes : the rate at which the star changes @xmath6 will be much shorter than that at which it changes @xmath5 .",
    "if we introduce a dissipation term in the picture , e.g. gravitational waves , the star follows the same initial evolution and , at some point , our test star , the compact object , reaches the region in which it is on a very radial orbit . in this case , at every periapsis passage , the test star loses a significant amount of energy and , hence , the semi - major axis shrinks .",
    "if the process is efficient enough it becomes an emri .",
    "stars in very radial orbits would then scatter faster in @xmath6 than in @xmath5 , so that they would end up as direct plunges , i.e. being swallowed by the mbh after an insignificant amount of gravitational wave bursts .",
    "although their event rate is much larger , they do not allow us to get a full picture of the scenario as complete as compared with the slow inspiral of an emri ( but see the recent work of * ? ? ? * on bursting sources ) .",
    "the threshold lies around @xmath7 pc @xcite and this is what has led up to now to the thought that the emri event rate should be dominated by the physical phenomena happening in the innermost volume around the mbh , of radius @xmath8 pc .",
    "however , while this is strictly true for schwarzschild mbhs , _ the situation for spinning mbhs drastically changes the narrative_. recently , @xcite proved that for kerr mbhs plunges do not plunge , but spend a very large number of cycles in the elisa band .",
    "i.e. they are simply high - eccentricity emris .",
    "the authors prove that the event rate of both high - eccentric and also low - eccentric emris is enhanced by the spin as compared to the schwarzschild case by an amount that depends on the specific eccentricity and inclination of the orbit .",
    "the fact that compact objects on a `` plunge '' orbit have been envisaged as uninteresting has led to an effort to understand the phenomena that could lead to the creation of emris in a volume of radius @xmath7 pc . in this volume ,",
    "resonant relaxation is very likely the most important process to lead compact objects to emri orbits @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , while in the absence of relativistic effects resonant relaxation is expected to change the angular momentum of the stellar bhs very efficiently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter mamw11 ) showed recently with a few direct @xmath0body experiments that introducing relativistic precession effects are both a blessing and a curse for the inspiral event rate : rr is quenched at high eccentricities , resulting in more inspirals than plunges .",
    "however , this quenching also means that , in total , fewer bhs will reach pericentres that are small enough to lead to an inspiral observable by gravitational wave detectors such as elisa @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a statistical study of the schwarzschild barrier ( sb ) with a set of 2,500 direct - summation @xmath0 body simulations including relativistic corrections to study and quantify this effect .",
    "we implement the relativistic effects using a post - newtonian formalism as in @xcite but also , and _ for the first time ever in a direct - summation integrator , a geodesic scheme_.    this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec.methods ] we present the physical setup and the numerical methods used . in section [ sec.results ]",
    "we present general results and discuss the implications for the schwarzschild barrier in section [ sec.sb ] .",
    "recently , mamw11 estimated with a few direct - summation n - body simulations expanded with a statistical monte - carlo study that the traditional emri event rate is markedly decreased by the presence of a blockade in the rate at which orbital angular momenta change takes place .",
    "this so - called schwarzschild barrier is a result of the impact of relativistic precession on to the stellar potential torques . although the authors find that some particles can penetrate the barrier , emris are significantly suppressed in this scenario .    in analogy to mamw11 ,",
    "the setup we consider consists of a central mbh of mass @xmath9 surrounded by 50 stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) of mass @xmath10 .",
    "we fix the masses of the mbh and the stellar black holes at    @xmath11    initially we distribute the stars in phase space following a distribution of the form @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the semi - major axis of the bhs and @xmath14 their eccentricity .",
    "the semi - major axes range between @xmath15 .",
    "this setup represents roughly a relaxed distribution of stellar mass objects around a mbh @xcite .",
    "we note that the event rates we obtain in this study are only applicable to this specific , idealized system where @xmath16 heavy , equal mass stellar bhs orbit a mbh . for more realistic estimates",
    "one would need to take into account other properties of galactic nuclei , such as the stellar background , a certain mass distribution and larger @xmath17 .      in order to have emri events ,",
    "one needs bhs on orbits with pericentres of only a few gravitational radii ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this requires the existence of physical mechanisms for driving bhs from their initial orbits onto very eccentric ones .",
    "a purely newtonian system has two different ways of exchanging angular momentum @xmath6 ( or eccentricity @xmath14 ) and orbital binding energy @xmath5 ( or semi - major axes @xmath13 ) .",
    "the first one is by two - body scattering , or non - resonant relaxation ( nr ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "every time two objects come close they undergo scattering , changing the momenta of the scattering partners .",
    "this very basic mechanism exists in all gravitationally interacting systems from compact star clusters to galaxies .",
    "the associated time - scale for changing the angular momentum @xmath6 of a given particle by @xmath19 is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the number of stars within a sphere of @xmath22mpc and @xmath23 will denote the semi - major axis in mpc throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "the derivation of this equation , although trivial , can be found in mamw11 .    in newtonian systems with a central massive object which dominates the gravitational potential , however , this relaxation mechanism is usually dominated by resonant relaxation ( rr ) @xcite .",
    "the torque of a spherical distribution of stars of mass @xmath24 inside a sphere of radius @xmath25 on a bh with semi - major axis @xmath13 leads to a retrograde orbital in - plane precession on a time - scale    @xmath26    where the eccentricity dependent function @xmath27 is given by    @xmath28    > from eq .",
    "( [ eq.m ] ) we can derive the time - scale of changes in the angular momentum , which for our system is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a factor of order unity .",
    "for the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq.rr ] ) we defer the reader to reference mamw11 .",
    "this mechanism for relaxation , rr , is much more efficient than nr _ at these distances _ because the particles interact through coherent torques in resonant keplerian orbits .",
    "it therefore could lead in principle to an enhancement in the emri event rate .",
    "relativistic effects introduce two new time - scales .",
    "the conservative schwarzschild precession , appearing in particular at the first and second post - newtonian orders , causes a precession of the pericentre by an angle    @xmath31    per orbit .",
    "this leads to the following associated time - scale    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the orbital period . in a more convenient notation",
    "this yields    @xmath34    the second important time - scale is the inspiral time @xmath35 via gravitational radiation only which , for high eccentricities ( @xmath36 ) , is given by @xcite    @xmath37    for @xmath38 .",
    "this timescale is highly sensitive to the eccentricity and semi - major axis and for a typical bh in the system much longer than any other relevant time .",
    "however , for particles very close to the central mbh , gravitational radiation may drive them gradually into the capture radius leading to an `` inspiral event '' .      in order to integrate the initial configuration over time we use the publicly available planet code by sverre aarseth  @xcite , a direct summation @xmath0body integrator . we have modified this code in order to introduce relativistic corrections to the newtonian acceleration @xcite .",
    "for the studies that we present here we have considered the following types of dynamics :    * purely newtonian dynamics * post - newtonian ( pn ) corrections * relativistic geodesic equations for motion of the particles around the mbh    in the purely newtonian case , the integration is obviously done without modifications to the acceleration equations . in the second case",
    "we add the pn corrections in the following way :    @xmath39    where the individual @xmath40 s denote the different pn corrections to the total force on a particle , which can be found in appendix  [ pn - corrections ] .",
    "given the high mass ratios involved in emris , their motion around a mbh can be also approximated by solving the geodesic equations of motion , neglecting in this way dissipative effects due to gravitational wave emission and higher - order corrections in the mass ratio . in our case ,",
    "the geodesic equations describe the exact trajectory of a test mass particle around a schwarzschild mbh .",
    "_ unlike the pn approximation , the geodesic equations are valid even in the last few @xmath41 during a plunge or inspiral _",
    ", however only in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "some orbits are expected to migrate towards plunge or inspiral orbits at pericentre distances of @xmath43 , where the errors of the pn approximation can already be quite significant @xcite . in order to test the existence of the schwarzschild barrier at small distances",
    ", we have implemented these corrections in the planet code .",
    "since the geodesic equations do not contain dissipative terms we compare the results of using them with the conservative pn implementations , i.e. setting the dissipative correction @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.f_pn ] ) .    at any",
    "given time all the active acceleration corrections are computed only between the mbh and a stellar bh object .",
    "the semi - major axis and eccentricity evolution is tracked by monitoring the distances at periapsis @xmath45 and apoapsis @xmath46 using the standard relations    @xmath47    which are valid for any acceleration correction .",
    "this calculation does not require a pn expansion of the keplerian expressions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 and is thus consistent with the purely newtonian , pn and geodesic equations of motion .",
    "we record a merger event whenever a particular has an instantaneous separation to the mbh of @xmath48 ( i.e. the schwarzschild last stable orbit for circular orbits ) .",
    "we note that mamw11 use @xmath49 and thus might classify a few events that we call inspirals as plunges .",
    "we run @xmath50 simulations of the models described above , with different random seeds for the distribution of stars , for a few myr or until a merger event happens .",
    "for all the different sets @xmath51 of simulations we will compute the average time @xmath52 for the occurrence of a certain event @xmath53 in the simulation set @xmath51 in the following way :    @xmath54    where the sum runs over all the total duration times @xmath55 of the @xmath56 simulations and @xmath57 gives the total number of events @xmath53 in the set @xmath51 .",
    "every simulation has been given a burn - in time of @xmath58 , which is of the order of @xmath59 ( see eq . [ eq.rr ] ) in order to discard merger events due to particles being created extremely close to the mbh or even within the capture radius by the randomization routine .",
    "( [ average - time ] ) , the possible events @xmath53 can be either @xmath60 for an inspiral event or @xmath61 for a plunge event .",
    "we define the error for our results as the poisson error ,    @xmath62    the criterion for an event to be an inspiral event is taken to be    1 .",
    "@xmath63 and 2 .",
    "@xmath64 .",
    "the second condition ensures that the semi - major axis of the merging body ( @xmath65 ) has shrunk significantly prior to capture in order to dismiss plunges with low semi - major axis .",
    "the choice of @xmath66years has empirically proven to distinguish perfectly between plunges and inspirals .      in this section",
    "we present the results for our study using only purely newtonian accelerations , i.e. only the term @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.f_pn ] ) . in this case , the individual objects exchange energy and angular momentum efficiently via resonant relaxation ( rr ) . for the plunge time , using eq .",
    "( [ average - time ] ) , we find    @xmath68    this agrees very well with the rr timescale given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.rr ] ) for a typical particle , which confirms that this is the dominant mechanism at these radii for driving stellar objects into the central body in the purely newtonian case .",
    "of course , we do not identify any inspirals in the absence of gravitational radiation effects .",
    "we now add only the dissipative effects due to gravitational radiation emission , which appear at 2.5 pn order , to the acceleration equations .",
    "the analysis of the simulations now gives    @xmath70    now , with the inclusion of the effects of gravitational radiation , gradual inspirals into the mbh are possible .",
    "this converts a subset of the plunge events from the simulations in set si into inspiral events .",
    "however , the inspiral time @xmath71 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.peters ] ) only becomes smaller than the rr time for @xmath72 which is smaller than the assumed capture radius .",
    "thus , the efficient rr still drives the majority of particles into the capture radius before they can decouple from the stellar background and undergo a clean inspiral .",
    "in other words , the transfer of angular momentum to more eccentric orbits by rr is faster than the circularization by the dissipative 2.5pn term .      in this set of simulations",
    "we include all pn terms up to 2.5pn order in our calculations .",
    "this introduces prograde schwarzschild precession in addition to the dissipation produced by gravitational - wave emission .",
    "this effect is expected to increase the associated times for inspiral and plunges , since it eliminates efficient rr at high eccentricities .",
    "we find @xmath75 as expected , the inspiral and plunge times are now of the order of a two - body relaxation time , eq .",
    "( [ eq.nr ] ) .",
    "we also see that the substantial difference between plunge and inspiral times seen in sii vanishes , because now the relaxation time - scale is much higher and gravitational radiation can more easily decouple the star from the stellar background .",
    "compared to the previous set now the 2.5pn term is able to circularize and shrink the bh orbit faster than classical relaxation increases eccentricity .      in order to compare our pn results with the results using geodesic equations of motion",
    ", we also ran a set of simulations with only the conservative 1pn and 2pn terms . in this set",
    "we find a plunge time of @xmath76 this is consistent with the time we would obtain from siii when combining plunge and inspiral events and shows again that the @xmath69pn term does not change the important mechanisms for angular momentum transfer .",
    "in this set of simulations we investigate the system using newtonian forces to describe the gravitational interactions between the stellar black holes and to describe the interaction between the mbh and individual stellar black holes we use the exact solution of the motion of a test mass in a schwarzschild metric ( geodesic motion ) .",
    "this does intrinsically exclude dissipative effects and therefore , the results of this subsection should be compared to those from the set siv . in the limit of @xmath77 , the geodesic equations ( in harmonic coordinates ) expanded up to @xmath74pn order and the conservative 2pn equations agree ( see appendix [ sec.appendix ] ) , and hence they are consistent descriptions at this level of approximation .",
    "in this set of simulations we obtain    @xmath78    which is consistent with @xmath79 .",
    "this agreement means that the motion very close to the mbh is not relevant for the relaxation processes that drive bhs into plunge orbits .",
