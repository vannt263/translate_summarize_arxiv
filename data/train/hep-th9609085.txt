    "0    early interest in lower - dimensional black hole physics @xcite has grown into a rich and fruitful field of research .",
    "the main motivation for this is that the salient problems of quantum black holes , such as loss of information and the endpoint of quantum evaporation , can be more easily understood in some simple low - dimensional models than directly in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "several interesting 2d candidates have been explored to this end which share many common features with their four - dimensional cousins @xcite .",
    "this is intriguing since the one - loop quantum effective action in two dimensions is exactly known , in the form of the polyakov - liouville term , giving rise to the hope that the semiclassical treatment of quantum black holes in two dimensions can be done explicitly ( see reviews @xcite ) .    the black hole in three - dimensional gravity discovered by ba@xmath1ados , teitelboim and zanelli ( btz ) @xcite has features that are even more realistic than its two - dimensional counterparts .",
    "it is similar to the kerr black hole , being characterized by mass @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 and having an event horizon and ( for @xmath4 ) an inner horizon @xcite .",
    "this solution naturally appears as the final stage of collapsing matter @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the kerr solution it is asymptotically anti - de sitter rather than asymptotically flat . geometrically , the btz black hole is obtained from 3d anti - de sitter ( ads@xmath5 ) spacetime by performing some identifications .",
    "although quantum field theory on curved three - dimensional manifolds is not as well understood as in two dimensions , the large symmetry of the btz geometry and its relation to ads@xmath5 allow one to obtain some precise results when field is quantized on this background .",
    "the green s function and quantum stress tensor for the conformally coupled scalar field and the resultant back reaction were calculated in @xcite .",
    "the possibility that black hole entropy might have a statistical explanation remains an intriguing issue , and there has been much recent activity towards its resolution via a variety of approaches ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "one such proposal is that the bekenstein - hawking entropy is completely generated by quantum fields propagating in the black hole background .",
    "originally it was belived that uv - divergent quantum corrections associated with such fields to the bekenstein - hawking expression play a fundamental role in the statistical interpretation of the entropy .",
    "however , it was subsequently realized that these divergent corrections can be associated with those that arise from the standard uv - renormalization of the gravitational couplings in the effective action @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea of complete generation of the entropy by quantum matter in the spirit of induced gravity @xcite encountered the problem of an appropriate statistical treatment of the entropy of non - minimally - coupled matter @xcite , @xcite ( see , however , another realization of this idea within the superstring paradigm @xcite ) . at the same time , it was argued in number of papers @xcite that uv - finite quantum corrections to the bekenstein - hawking entropy might be even more important than the uv - infinite ones .",
    "they could provide essential modifications of the thermodynamics of a hole at late stages of the evaporation when quantum effects come to play .",
    "relatively little work has been done concerning the quantum aspects of the entropy for the btz black hole .",
    "carlip @xcite has shown that the appropriate quantization of 3d gravity represented in the chern - simons form yields a set of boundary states at the horizon .",
    "these can be counted using methods of wess - zumino - witten theory .",
    "remarkably , the logarithm of their number gives the classical bekenstein - hawking formula .",
    "this is the unique case of a statistical explanation of black hole entropy .",
    "unfortunately , it is essentially based on features peculiar to three - dimensional gravity and its extension to four dimensions is not straightforward .",
    "an investigation of the thermodynamics of quantum scalar fields on the btz background @xcite concluded that the divergent terms in the entropy are not always due to the existence of the outer horizon ( i.e. the leading term in the quantum entropy is not proportional to the area of the outer horizon ) and depend upon the regularization method .",
    "this conclusion seems to be in disagreement with the expectations based on the study of the problem in two and four dimensions .    in this paper",
    "we systematically calculate the heat kernel , effective action and quantum entropy of scalar matter for the btz black hole .",
    "the relevant operator is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath8 is the cosmological constant appearing in the btz solution . since we are interested in the thermodynamic aspects we consider the euclidean btz geometry with a conical singularity at the horizon as the background . in the process of getting the heat kernel and effective action on this singular geometry we proceed in steps , first calculating quantities explicitly for ads@xmath5 , then the regular btz instanton and finally the conical btz instanton .",
    "the entropy is calculated by differentiating the effective action with respect to the angular deficit at the horizon .",
    "it contains both uv - divergent and uv - finite terms .",
    "the analysis of the divergences shows that they are explicitly renormalized by renormalization of newton s constant in accordance with general arguments @xcite .",
    "we find the structure of the uv - finite terms in the entropy to be particularly interesting .",
    "these terms , negligible for large outer horizon area @xmath0 , behave logarithmically at small @xmath0 . hence they should become important at late stages of black hole evaporation .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the euclidean btz geometry , omitting details that appear in earlier work @xcite .",
    "we discuss in section 3 various forms of the metric for 3d anti - de sitter space giving expressions for the geodesic distance on ads@xmath5 that are relevant for our purposes .",
    "we solve explicitly the heat kernel equation and find the green s function on ads@xmath5 as a function of the geodesic distance .",
    "in section 4 we calculate explicitly the trace of heat kernel and the effective action on the regular and singular euclidean btz instantons .",
    "the quantum entropy is the subject of section 5 and in section 6 we provide some concluding remarks .",
    "0    we start with the black hole metric written in a form that makes it similar to the four - dimensional kerr metric .",
    "since we are interested in its thermodynamic behaviour , we write the metric in the euclidean form : @xmath9 where the metric function @xmath10 reads @xmath11 and we use the notation @xmath12 where we note the useful identity @xmath13 for future reference .",
    "the function @xmath14 in ( [ 1 ] ) is @xmath15    in order to transform the metric ( [ 1 ] ) to lorentzian singnature we need to make the transformation : @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "then we have that @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the values in the lorentzian space - time .",
    "these are the respective radii of the outer and inner horizons of the lorentzian black hole in @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "therefore we must always apply the transformation ( [ ? ] ) after carrying out all calculations in the euclidean geometry in order to obtain the result for the lorentzian black hole .",
    "the lorentzian version of the metric ( [ 1 ] ) describes a black hole with mass @xmath22 and angular momentum @xmath23 @xcite , @xcite . introducing @xmath24",
    "we find that in the @xmath25 sector of the metric ( [ 1 ] ) there is no conical singularity at the horizon if the euclidean time @xmath26 is periodic with period @xmath27 .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is the hawking temperature of the hole .",
    "the horizon @xmath29 is a one - dimensional space with metric @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a natural coordinate on the horizon .",
    "looking at the metric ( [ 1 ] ) one can conclude that there is no constraint on the periodicity of the `` angle '' variable @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the four - dimensional black hole , for which the angle @xmath32 in the spherical line element @xmath34 varies between the limits @xmath35 in order to avoid the appearance of the conical singularities at the poles of the sphere .",
    "however , following tradition we will assume that the metric ( [ 1 ] ) is periodic in @xmath32 , with limits @xmath35 .",
    "this means that @xmath29 is a circle with length ( `` area '' ) @xmath36 .",
    "there are a number of other useful forms for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "it is very important for our considerations that ( [ 1 ] ) is obtained from the metric of three - dimensional anti - de sitter space by making certain identifications along the trajectories of its killing vectors . in order to find the appropriate metric for the 3d anti - de sitter space ( denoted below by @xmath37 ) we consider a four - dimensional flat space with metric @xmath38 ads@xmath5 ( @xmath37 )",
    "is defined as a subspace defined by the equation @xmath39 introducing the coordinates @xmath40 @xmath41 the metric on @xmath37 reads @xmath42 it is easy to see that under the coordinate transformation @xmath43 the metric ( [ 1 ] ) coincides with ( [ 10 ] ) . in the next section",
    "we will derive a few other forms of the metric on @xmath37 which are useful in the context of calculation of the heat kernel and green s function on @xmath37 .",
    "the btz black hole ( @xmath44 ) described by the metric ( [ 1 ] ) is obtained from ads@xmath5 with metric ( [ 10 ] ) by making the following identifications :    @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "this means that @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 , which is the analog of @xmath51 .",

    "it has the range @xmath54 .",
    "the point @xmath55 is the horizon ( @xmath56 ) while @xmath57 lies at infinity .",
    "geometrically , @xmath58 means that there is no conical singularity at the horizon , which is easily seen from ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "a section of btz black hole at fixed @xmath52 is illustrated in fig.1 for the non - rotating ( @xmath59 ) and rotating cases .",
    "the opposite sides of the quadrangle in fig.1 are identified .",
    "therefore , the whole section looks like a torus . in the rotating case",
    "the torus is deformed with deformation parameter @xmath60 , where @xmath61 .",
    "the whole space @xmath44 is a region between two semispheres with @xmath62 being radius , @xmath52 playing the role of azimuthal angle and @xmath63 being the orbital angle .",
    "the boundaries of the region are identified according to @xmath64 .",
    "0    * 3.1 metric on @xmath37 *    3d anti - de sitter space ( @xmath37 ) is defined as a 3-dimensional subspace of the flat four - dimensional space - time with metric @xmath65 satisfying the constraint @xmath66 we are interested in ads@xmath5 , which has euclidean signature .",
    "this is easily done by appropriately choosing the signature in ( [ 2.1 ] ) , ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "the induced metric has a number of different representations depending on the choice of the coordinates on ads@xmath5 .",
    "below we consider two such choices .",
    "* a. * resolve equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) as follows : @xmath67 the variables @xmath68 can be considered as coordinates on @xmath37 .",

    "note that the section of @xmath37 corresponding to a fixed @xmath71 is a two - dimensional torus .",
    "the induced metric then takes the following form : @xmath72 the btz black hole metric is then obtained from ( [ 2.4 ] ) by making the identifications @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 .    *",
    "b. * another way to resolve the constraint ( [ 2.2 ] ) is by employing the transformation @xmath76 the section @xmath77 of @xmath37 is a two - dimensional sphere .",
    "the induced metric in the coordinates @xmath78 takes the form @xmath79 from which one can easily see that @xmath37 is a hyperbolic version of the metric on the 3-sphere @xmath80 allowing us to making use of our experience with the 3-sphere in understanding the geometry of @xmath37 .    * 3.2 geodesic distance on @xmath37 *    an important fact equally applicable both to @xmath81 and @xmath37 is the following .",
    "consider two different points on @xmath81 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "then we can choose the coordinate system @xmath78 such that one of the points lies at the origin ( @xmath82 ) and the other point lies on the radius @xmath83 .",
    "this radial trajectory joining the two points is a geodesic .",
    "moreover , the geodesic distance between these two points coincides with @xmath84 .",
    "more generally , for the metric ( [ 2.6 ] ) , ( [ 2.7 ] ) the geodesic distance between two points with equal values of @xmath85 and @xmath32 ( @xmath86 ) is given by @xmath87 .    in order to find the geodesic distance in the coordinate system @xmath88 ( [ 2.3 ] )",
    "consider the following trick .",
    "the two points @xmath2 and @xmath89 in the embedding four - dimensional space determine the vectors @xmath90 and @xmath91 starting from the origin : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an orthonormal basis of vectors in the space ( [ 2.1 ] ) : @xmath94    for the scalar product of @xmath95 and @xmath96 we have @xmath97 where @xmath98 and for simplicity we assumed that @xmath99 .",
    "the scalar product @xmath100 is invariant quantity not dependent on a concrete choice of coordinates .",

    "we have @xmath102 the new basis @xmath103 is obtained from the old basis @xmath93 by some orhogonal rotation .",

    "note , that @xmath111 in ( [ 2.13 ] ) , ( [ 2.14 ] ) is the intrinsic geodesic distance on @xmath37 .",
    "it is worth comparing with the chordal four - dimensional distance @xmath29 between the points @xmath2 and @xmath89 measured in the imbedding 4d space . in the coordinate system ( [ 2.3 ] ) we obtain @xmath112 after simplification we obtain @xmath113    consider now the point @xmath114 which is antipodal to the point @xmath89 .",

    "this operator would be conformal invariant .",
    "this equivalence , however , is no longer valid for the space @xmath126 which has a conical singularity .",
    "this is because the scalar curvature on a conical space has a @xmath127-function - like contribution due to a singularity that is additional to the regular value of the curvature .",
    "the @xmath127-function in the operator @xmath128 has been shown @xcite to non - trivially modify the regular heat kernel . in order to avoid the problem of dealing with this perculiarity we will not make use of this form of the operator and",
    "will treat the term @xmath129 as just a constant that is unrelated to the curvature of space - time .",
    "the function @xmath130 satisfying ( [ 2.19 ] ) can be found as some function of the geodesic distance @xmath84 between the points @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the simplest way to do this is to use the coordinate system @xmath133 with the metric ( [ 2.6 ] ) when both points lie on the radius : @xmath134 .",

    "this happens when @xmath150 , i.e. one of the points lies on the equator @xmath151 .",
    "this fact is important in view of the arguments of @xcite that the correct quantization on a non - globally hyperbolic space , like ads@xmath5 , requires the fixing of some boundary condition for a quantum field at infinity .",
    "the green s function ( [ 2.22 ] ) constructed by means of the heat kernel ( [ 2.21 ] ) automatically satisfies the dirichlet boundary condition and thus provides for us the correct quantization on @xmath37 . to our knowledge , the form ( [ 2.22 ] ) of the green s function on @xmath37 is not known in the current literature .",
    "a special case occurs when @xmath139 and @xmath140 , for which the operator @xmath152 is conformally invariant . in this case",

    "the @xmath162 terms are due to uncontractible winding paths that go @xmath163 times around the circle .",
    "note that @xmath159 automatically has the periodicity given in @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the sum over images in ( [ 3.1 ] ) provides us with the periodicity @xmath64 . assuming that @xmath99 it can be represented in the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 takes the form ( [ 2.20 ] ) .    for the further applications",
