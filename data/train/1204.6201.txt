    "after the string theory had indicated that noncommutative ( nc ) gauge field theory ( gft ) could be one of its low - energy effective - theory realisation @xcite , the studies on noncommutative particle phenomenology started their development @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to find possible experimental signatures and predict / estimate bounds on the nc spacetime from collider physics experimental data , in particular from the standard model ( sm ) forbidden , earlier introduced and very well known @xmath2 decay mode as well as the invisible @xmath3 decay .",
    "the nc contributions are for the latter decay are analyzed and discussed first time in this article .",
    "nice progress has been obtained in the seiberg - witten ( sw ) maps and enveloping algebra based models where one could deform commutative gauge theories with arbitrary gauge group and representation   @xcite .",
    "possible constraints on the @xmath4 charges @xcite are also rescinded in this approach .",
    "the noncommutative extensions of particle physics models like the covariant noncommutative sm ( ncsm ) and the nc gut models @xcite were constructed .",
    "these allow a minimal ( no new particle content ) deformation with the sacrifice that interactions include infinitely many terms defined through recursion over ( and in practice the cut - off at a certain order of ) the nc parameter @xmath5 .",
    "there were also other studies with nc modifications of the particle - physics theory @xcite .",
    "studies of divergences have been performed since the early stage of the nc qft development @xcite . later on trouble - free one - loop quantum corrections to noncommutative scalar @xmath6 theories @xcite and",
    "the nc qed @xcite have been obtained .",
    "also the sw map expanded ncsm @xcite at first order in @xmath1 , albeit breaking the lorentz symmetry is found to be anomaly free @xcite , having also well - behaved one - loop quantum corrections @xcite .    at @xmath1-order",
    "there are two important interactions that are suppressed and/or forbidden in the sm , the triple neutral gauge boson interaction @xcite , and the tree level coupling of neutrinos to photons @xcite , respectively . here the expansion and cut - off in powers of the nc parameters @xmath5 corresponds to an expansion in momenta , restricting the range of validity to energies well below the nc scale @xmath7 .",
    "usually , this is no problem for experimental predictions because the lower bound on the nc parameters @xmath8 ( the coefficients @xmath9 being of order one ) runs higher than typical momenta involved in a particular process . however , there are exotic processes in the early universe as well as those involving ultra high energy cosmic rays @xcite in which the typical energy involved is higher than the current experimental bound on the nc scale @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the previous @xmath1-cut - off approximate results are inapplicable . to cure the cut - off approximation",
    ", we are using @xmath1-exact expressions , inspired by the exact formulas for the sw map @xcite , and expand in powers of gauge fields , as we did in @xcite . in @xmath1-exact models",
    "we have studied the uv / ir mixing @xcite , the neutrino propagation @xcite and also some nc photon - neutrino phenomenology @xcite , respectively .    due to the presence of the uv / ir mixing the @xmath1-exact model",
    "is generally regarded as not perturbatively renormalizable , thus the relation of quantum corrections to observations is not entirely clear  @xcite . however ,",
    "recently we observed that certain possibility of reducing the severity of divergences using constraints on both the deformation freedom and noncommutative parameter @xmath1 @xcite could occur . in a noncommutative @xmath10 model we found that via the combination of deformation freedom and appropriate choices of the noncommutative parameter @xmath1",
    ", one could remove all divergences from both the one - loop neutrino ( neutral fermion ) and photon self - energy . in particular",
    "there exists a particular combination where the photon self - interaction contribution to photon self - energy reduces to a single finite term  @xcite .",
    "a deformation freedom was also shown recently to be capable of suppressing the divergent structures at one - loop and first order in the noncommutative parameter @xmath1",
    "@xcite .- expansion when such parameters are allowed to be renormalized  @xcite .",
    "it may also worth notice that in a @xmath1-exact treatment the momentum power series sum into phase shifts , therefore do not increase the superficial uv divergent order . ] assuming that controls over divergences in noncommutative phenomenological models could be made available , either in the @xmath1-expanding or in the @xmath1-exact approach , tree level amplitudes will always serve as the leading order contribution to the relevant particle physics process in such models given perturbation theory is trustable .    in the particular context of the uv / ir mixing problem",
    "it is also very important to mention a complementary approach @xcite where nc gauge theories are realized as effective qfts , underlain by some more fundamental theory such as string theory .",
    "it was claimed that for a large class of more general qfts above the uv cutoff the phenomenological effects of the uv completion can be quite successfully modeled by a threshold value of the uv cutoff .",
    "so , in the presence of a finite uv cutoff _ neither _ sort of divergence will ever appear since the problematic phase factors effectively transform the highest energy scale ( the uv cutoff ) into the lowest one ( the ir cutoff ) .",
    "what is more , not only the full scope of noncommutativity is experienced only in the range delimited by the two cutoffs , but for the scale of nc high enough , the whole standard model can be placed below the ir cutoff .",
    "in such a way the uv / ir mixing problem becomes hugely less pressing , making , at the same time , a study of the theory at the quantum level much more reliable .    to study triple neutral gauge boson couplings , in this report",
    "we construct the @xmath1-exact pure gauge - sector action of the @xmath11 gauge group , while for the nc z - boson - neutrino and photon - neutrino interactions we are using the actions from @xcite .",
    "we compute only tree level processes and therefore treat the nc model as an effective theory only .",
    "the decay of @xmath12 boson into two photons has been used to predict possible experimental signatures of the ncsm @xcite . since by bose - symmetry and rotational invariance arguments @xcite any vector particle",
    "can not decay into two massless vector particles , this forbidden decay has very little background from the standard model .",
    "fixing @xmath1 spontaneously breaks c , p , and/or cp discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "see also general discussions on the c , p , t , and cp properties of the noncommutative interactions in @xcite , and in the case of our model a discussion given in @xcite .",
    "a breaking of c symmetry occurs in the @xmath13 process .",
    "one common approximation in those existing works is that only the vertices linear in the nc parameter @xmath1 were used .    in this work",
    "we extend the ncsm gauge sector actions for first time to all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "next we discuss the decay widths @xmath14 and @xmath15 as functions of the nc scale @xmath7 for space / light - like noncommutativity which are allowed by the unitarity conditions @xcite .",
    "as usual we consider the star@xmath16-product formalism for quantum field theory on the deformed moyal space with a constant nc parameter @xmath1 . we start with a @xmath1-exact hybrid sw - map expansion of the noncommutative gauge field @xmath17 in the terms of component commutative fields , @xmath18 \\bigg ] .",

    "the second trace is slightly more complicated as it is connected with details of representation of the gauge group ( we denote it as @xmath34 ) . also , using the generalized star product @xmath20 , we can rewrite the star - commutator as @xmath35=-\\theta^{\\rho\\tau}\\partial_\\rho v^b_\\mu\\star_2 \\partial_\\tau v^c_\\nu$ ] , and obtain : @xmath36+ ...",

    "figure  [ fig2 ] magnifies the low nc scale regime of fig  [ fig1 ] for fixed coupling constant @xmath152 , for fixed gauge - deformation parameter @xmath89 , and with one more curve for the full rank @xmath5 @xcite added . in the u(1 ) model  of @xcite with deformation @xmath89 . ] note that the first order result for @xmath89 becomes @xmath153 with the two lengths @xmath154 and @xmath155 weighing exactly the same .",
    "therefore the first order result for all three @xmath1 choices in figure  [ fig2 ] coincide with the full result for space - like @xmath1 , while the @xmath1-exact results access the difference among @xmath5 choices at low nc scales .",
    "an important consequence of this paper is that the coupling @xmath156 and the nc scale @xmath7 are independent parameters , whereas in the @xmath1-expanded models ( linear in @xmath1 ) experiments measure always the combination @xmath157 .",
    "furthermore , at very @xmath7 low scales the full @xmath1-exact decay rate is sensitive to the tensor structure of the @xmath5 tensor for @xmath158 , as shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "however , these differences are not relevant when the nc scale is much larger than the @xmath12-boson mass .",
    "this fact is quite transparent from both figs , [ fig1 ] , and  [ fig2 ] , respectively . in order to maximize the @xmath90 rate , in the above",
    "analyzes we have used the maximal allowed value @xmath152 computed and given in figures and tables of @xcite .",
    "this is different with respect to the analysis of the rate computed at the first order in @xmath1 in  @xcite , where the lower central value from the figures and the tables in @xcite @xmath159 was used .",
    "anyhow the ratio of two values @xmath160 , is representing just an overall shift - factor , in any analysis .",

    "[ fig1 ] we see that current experimental upper limit @xmath162 @xcite is way too weak to produce any meaningful constraint on the scale of noncommutativity .",
    "however , we can certainly expect that further analysis of the lhc experiments would significantly improve the current limit on the @xmath90 partial width .",

    "a comparison of the experimental @xmath107 decay width @xmath172 mev @xcite with its sm theoretical counterpart , allows us to set a constraint @xmath173 mev , from where a bound on the scale of noncommutativity @xmath174 gev is obtained ( see fig .

    "black curves correspond to @xmath1-exact rate , while straight ( red ) curves correspond to the expanded decay rate.,width=321 ]    comparing to previous results , the total decay rates are modified by a factor which remains finite throughout all energy scales .",
    "thus , our results behave much better than the @xmath1-expansion method when ultra high energy processes are considered .",
    "we expect that similar control on the high energy behavior can be extended to @xmath1-exact perturbation theory involving more external fields in the near future .",
    "all of our results show closed / convergent forms ( see figs .",
