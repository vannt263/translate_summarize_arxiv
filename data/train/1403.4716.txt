    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we adopt the recurrence plot method to construct recurrence networks . in section 3",

    "we finally draw some conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the method of recurrence plots is based on the theory of phase space reconstruction introduced by packard _",
    "_ @xcite . in order to easily construct a more suitable space and",
    "then to reveal more meaningful information from original time series , packard _",
    "@xcite proposed the derivative reconstruction method and time delay method to reconstruct a finite - dimensional phase space .",
    "however , in practice , we do not know any prior information of time series , therefore the latter method is widely used to reconstruct phase space of time series . for a given scalar time series @xmath13 , we construct the delay vectors @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the embedding dimension and @xmath18 is the time delay .",
    "takens embedding theorem ensures that we can recreate a topologically equivalent @xmath17-dimensional phase space from an infinite noise - free time series data by means of the time delay method @xcite .",
    "the most significant advantage of phase space reconstruction is that it can preserve the geometrical invariants of the original system , such as the fractal dimension and the lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "so we can investigate much about the dynamics characteristics of time series in phase space more easily .",
    "the basic embedding theorem of phase space reconstruction assumes that we can choose the delay time @xmath18 without any limitation and the embedding dimension @xmath17 under the condition of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fractal dimension of the underlying attractor .",
    "however , since the observed time series data sets are finite and noisy in the most common case , the selection of the time delay @xmath18 and the embedding dimension @xmath17 is rather important for the quality of the phase space reconstruction .",
    "the binary recurrence matrix @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a threshold distance , @xmath24 is a suitable norm ( e.g. , the @xmath25 - norm , the euclidean norm and the @xmath26 - norm ) in the considered phase space and @xmath27 is the heaviside step function ( i.e. @xmath28 if @xmath29 , and @xmath30 otherwise ) . the resulting matrix @xmath31 is a symmetric matrix where the elements @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , the matrix @xmath34 exhibits the line of identity ( the main diagonal ) @xmath35 . in a two - dimensional space ,",
    "the recurrence plot is described by using different colors for different values of the recurrence matrix , e.g. , plotting a black dot at the coordinates @xmath36 if @xmath37 , and a white dot if @xmath38 .",
    "thus the recurrence plot always has a black main diagonal line .",
    "now we obtain the adjacency matrix @xmath39 of the recurrence network from the recurrence matrix @xmath34 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the kronecker delta function introduced here in order to avoid self - loops @xcite .",
    "in complex network , each state vector @xmath7 of the reconstructed phase space represents a single node .",
    "the topological structure of the recurrence network can be described with the adjacency matrix @xmath42 , and the elements @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to connection and disconnection , respectively . and",
    "the size of the network is @xmath45 .",
    "as mentioned above , the choice of the time delay @xmath18 and the embedding dimension @xmath17 plays an important role in the recurrence plot method",
    ". if the time delay @xmath18 selected is too small , each coordinate of the vector @xmath7 will be so close to each other that the trajectories of the reconstructed phase space are compressed along the identity line , and this phenomenon is referred to as redundance .",
    "if the time delay @xmath18 selected is too large , the coordinates of the vector @xmath7 are completely independent of each other and then the reconstructed attractor dynamics become causally disconnected , and this phenomenon is referred to as irrelevance @xcite . at present , auto - correlation function @xcite and mutual information method @xcite are the most common approaches for the estimation of the time delay @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite proposed a recursive method of calculating mutual information and pointed out that the first local minimum of mutual information is the best criterion for choosing time delay @xmath18 in phase space reconstruction from time series data .",
    "takens embedding theorem gives us a way to estimate the embedding dimension @xmath17 .",
    "this is to say that all self - intersections of the orbit ( which is the reconstructed attractor ) in the reconstructed phase space will be eliminated for any embedding dimension @xmath46 .",
    "the attractor will be completely unfolded in this embedding dimension @xmath17 .",
    "but in practice , since the dimension @xmath20 is unknown in many cases , we can not directly calculate the embedding dimension @xmath17 from the takens embedding theorem .",
    "many algorithms based on computing some invariants on the attractor have been proposed to calculate the minimum embedding dimension @xmath17 .",
    "the most popular method for calculating the minimum embedding dimension is the false nearest - neighbors ( fnn ) algorithm @xcite . according to the takens embedding theorem",
    ", we assume that @xmath17 is qualified as an embedding dimension . if any two points are close to each other in the @xmath17-dimensional phase space , then they are still close to each other in the @xmath47-dimensional phase space .",
    "we call this two points true neighbors , otherwise , they are false neighboring points .",
    "the main idea of the fnn algorithm is to measure the percentage of false nearest neighbors along a signal trajectory change with increasing embedding dimension .",
    "the optimal embedding dimension means that there is no false neighbors and self - intersections in the phase space .",
    "this indicates that the minimum embedding dimension is that for which the percentage of false nearest neighbors drops to zero or nearly zero for a given tolerance level for the first time @xcite .",
    "the threshold distance @xmath23 is another key parameter of an rp .",
    "the selection of the threshold @xmath23 depends strongly on the system considered .",
    "if @xmath23 is too small , there may be almost no recurrence points and we can not learn anything about the recurrence structure of the underlying system . on the other hand , if @xmath23 is too large , almost every point is a neighbor of every other point , which leads to a lot of artifacts and redundant information @xcite .",
    "therefore , special attention has been required on its choice . in practice ,",
    "the most common method is to set @xmath23 for a certain proportion of the standard deviation @xmath48 of the original time series .",
    "however , riley and van orden suggested choosing @xmath23 such that the recurrence point density remains low ( often smaller than 5% ) @xcite .",
    "this method is often used in rqa .",
    "the advantage of choosing an adaptive recurrence threshold by using a fixed recurrence rate in rqa is that it can preserve the recurrence point density and then allows us to compare the results of recurrence quantification analysis of different systems .",
    "it is easy to imagine that there is no direct relationship between recurrence rate or link density and network connectivity . and",
    "it is so difficult for us to find a fixed recurrence rate that all recurrence networks obtained at recurrence threshold @xmath23 calculated from the fixed recurrence rate are connected .",
    "however , we restrict our attention to the consideration of connected network in this article .",
    "therefor we do not adopt the fixed recurrence rate for obtaining such an appropriate recurrence threshold .",
    "if we do so , then we will not be able to study the topological and fractal properties of the entire network .",
    "in other word , we can only focus on the disconnected components or the largest connected component of each recurrence network .",
    "the critical phenomenon is one of the most interesting findings of complex networks . in 1959 ,",
    "erds _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the classical random graph model and studied the structural phase transition of the birth of the giant connected component in the network architectures .",
    "every pair of nodes of random graph is connected with probability @xmath49 .",
    "they found that there exists a critical probability @xmath50 where a giant connected component was formed and it can be spread across the entire network . if the probability @xmath49 is less than this critical probability @xmath50 , the network is composed of disconnected components .",
    "similarly to the critical behavior of random - graph theory , we study the critical connectivity of the recurrence networks by examining the size of the largest connected component and then determine the critical recurrence threshold @xmath51 . here",
    "we firstly employ the connection rate of network to quantify the connectivity of the recurrence network , which is defined as the number of nodes of the largest connected component divided by the size of the network .",
    "secondly , we observe the change of connection rate of network with the increase of the parameter @xmath23 .",
    "it can be easily imagined that the connection rate of network increases when the parameter @xmath23 becomes larger , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in fig . 1 , we set the recurrence threshold @xmath23 ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 with a step of @xmath54 , where @xmath48 is the standard deviation of the original fbm series .",
    "finally , we choose an appropriate recurrence threshold @xmath51 where the connection rate of the network arrives at @xmath33 for the first time . as can be seen in fig . 1 , we set the critical recurrence threshold @xmath55 .",
    "the recurrence network obtained at recurrence threshold @xmath51 will be connected .",
    "the threshold @xmath23 beyond this critical value @xmath51 will result in redundant connections among nodes , and threshold @xmath23 below this critical value @xmath51 will lead to a number of disconnected components where each component only contains a connected subnetwork .",
    "consequently , we select this suitable recurrence threshold @xmath51 to construct the recurrence network and then investigate its topological and fractal properties . in addition",
    ", we also notice that the critical recurrence threshold @xmath51 decreases with the increase of the hurst index @xmath1 from 0.4 to 0.95 . we know that the fbm series is relatively more smooth and regular for large hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "the consequence is that there are many data points in the original fbm series are mapped to state vectors which are close to each other in a dense region of the phase space so that the largest connected component of the recurrence network contains more nodes than the one of the network with the small hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "the specific explanation for this phenomenon can be found in the second subsection of the section 3 .    in this work ,",
    "we consider fbm of length @xmath56 with different hurst indices @xmath1 ranging from 0.05 to 0.95 ( the step difference is 0.05 ) .",
    "recurrence networks can be constructed by the following steps :    1 .   for a given fbm time series",
    ", we use the mutual information method @xcite and the fnn algorithm @xcite to calculate the time delay @xmath18 and the embedding dimension @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "these two procedures are available on tocsy software platform @xcite .",
    "the values of embedding dimensions @xmath17 we got vary from 5 to 7 , and those of the time delay @xmath18 vary from 10 to 20 .",
    "we use the connection rate of the recurrence network to determine the suitable threshold distance @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "we observe the connection rate of network reaching @xmath33 for the first time when the parameter @xmath23 ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath57 with a step of @xmath54 , where @xmath48 is the standard deviation of the original fbm series .",
    "the connection rate of network can be calculated by matlab - bgl toolbox @xcite in matlab .",
    "3 .   based on the above steps",
    ", we can calculate the recurrence matrix @xmath34 by eq .",
    "then we obtain the binary adjacency matrix @xmath42 of an unweighted and undirected recurrence network by eq .",
    "( 3 ) . as a result",
    ", the recurrence network is also connected .",
    "for clarity of visualization , we here only draw the recurrence network for the fbm series of length @xmath58 with hurst index @xmath59 . after obtaining the adjacency matrix @xmath42 of recurrence network according to the above three steps ,",
    "we convert the adjacency matrix @xmath42 into  pajek \" @xcite format and then we adopt the  pajek \" which is a freely available software platform for visualizing and analyzing complex networks to visualize the recurrence network . as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "2 , the recurrence network constructed from the associated fbm series is connected .",
    "in addition , we find that the connection rates of recurrence networks constructed from fbms with hurst indices @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are far less than 1 . in these cases ,",
    "the recurrence networks are not connected .",
    "so in the following sections , we only consider connected networks with hurst indices @xmath1 from 0.4 to 0.95 .",
    "in this section , we numerically study the basic topological features of recurrence networks including the degree distribution , the clustering coefficient and the motif distribution .",
    "recent works have shown that a large number of real - world networks are referred to as scale - free networks because the degree distributions @xmath62 follows a power - law @xmath63 where the degree exponent @xmath64 varying in the range @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the degree distributions of the visibility graphs constructed from fbms have power - law tails @xcite .",
    "in addition , xie _ et al . _ @xcite found that horizontal visibility graphs constructed from fbms have exponential degree distributions @xmath66 and the degree exponent @xmath67 increases with hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown that many real - world complex networks share similar universal statistical features , such as the small - world character and the scale - free distribution , but may demonstrate different local structure characteristics @xcite .",
    "an in - depth study of motif distribution can help us to understand the design principles of complex networks on the local structure level @xcite . in 2004 ,",
    "@xcite developed an approach for comparing network local structures , basing on the significance profile ( sp ) .",
    "they calculated the triad significance profile ( tsp ) for networks from different fields and found that networks with similar characteristic profiles are grouped into superfamilies .",
    "degree distribution is one of the most fundamental and important topological properties of complex networks .",
    "we simulated fbms with different hurst indices @xmath1 ranging from 0.40 to 0.95 with an increment of 0.05 .",
    "for each value of @xmath1 , we generated 1000 realizations and then calculated the average degree distribution .",
    "for example , we give the average degree distribution of recurrence networks constructed from fbms with hurst index @xmath59 in fig .",
    "we find that all the recurrence networks constructed from fbm series exhibit exponential degree distributions .",
    "we estimated the degree exponents @xmath67 and display the average degree exponents @xmath0 in fig .",
    "4 . from fig .",
    "4 , we can see that the parameter @xmath67 increases first and then decreases with the increase of @xmath1 .",
    "the inflection point is at around @xmath68 .",
    "we find that the relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be fitted by a cubic polynomial function which is also shown in fig .",
    "4 .      the clustering coefficient measures the density of triangles in a complex network . the definition of the clustering coefficient given by watts and strogatz in ref .",
    "@xcite has been used quite widely in complex network .",
    "the local clustering coefficient @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the degree of node @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the actual number of edges among @xmath71 nearest neighbor nodes of the node @xmath72 . the clustering coefficient of the whole network is then given by the average of @xmath69 over all the nodes in the entire network : @xmath74 from the geometrical point of view , the local clustering coefficient @xmath69 also can be defined as @xmath75 where a triple represents a vertex with edges connected any two neighbor vertices .",
    "there are two different triples as shown in fig .",
    "5 . the triple @xmath76 will occur if the three vertices are all close to each other .",
    "conversely , the triple @xmath77 will occur if the vertex @xmath72 is connected to its two neighbor vertices @xmath78 and @xmath79 , but vertices @xmath78 and @xmath79 are not connected . in network topology ,",
    "the triangle structure @xmath76 means transitivity and stability in the network .    in this paper",
    ", we study the dependence of the clustering coefficient @xmath80 of the recurrence networks against the hurst index @xmath1 of the original fbms . for each @xmath1 , we simulated the fbm @xmath81 times , hence we got 1000 fbm series .",
    "for each fbm series , a recurrence network was constructed and its clustering coefficient @xmath80 was calculated .",
    "we display the relationship between @xmath1 and the average clustering coefficient @xmath82 of recurrence networks in fig .",
    "6 . from fig",
    ". 6 , we can see that the average clustering coefficient @xmath82 increases with the hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "the results show that there are more triangle structures in the recurrence network when the hurst index @xmath1 increases from 0.4 to 0.95 .",
    "this means that the transitive and stable structure is more common for large hurst indices .",
    "this phenomenon can be easily explained by following points . it is well known that the hurst index characterizes the raggedness and irregularity of fbm .",
    "as already mentioned , the fbm is a self - similar process with stationary increments and possesses long - range dependence .",
    "the hurst index @xmath1 @xmath83 is a measure of the intensity of long - range dependence in a fbm series .",
    "more specifically , the fbm with @xmath4 indicates the absence of long - range dependence .",
    "and the closer hurst index @xmath1 is to @xmath33 , the greater the extent of long - range dependence or persistence .",
    "the hurst index @xmath1 less than @xmath84 corresponds to anti - persistence , which means that the process displays strong negatively correlated and fluctuates violently . for large hurst index @xmath1 , the fbm series is relatively more smooth and regular .",
    "the result is that close data points in the original fbm series are mapped to state vectors @xmath7 which are close to each other in a dense region of the phase space so that these nodes @xmath7 are more likely to be connected to each other in recurrence network . as expected , there are many more transitive and stable structures @xmath76 are to appear in recurrence network constructed from the fbm series with large hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "however , the fbm series with small hurst index @xmath1 is relatively more rough and irregular . as a consequence of this ,",
    "these close points in the original fbm series are mapped to state vectors @xmath7 in a sparse region of the phase space that are less likely to be mutually connected , and therefore the triple @xmath77 will be more common . from this point of view , the recurrence network reflects the smoothness and regularity of the fbms to some extent .      because it is very time - consuming to study next a few properties of large complex networks , we only generated 100 realizations of fbm for each value of hurst index @xmath1 and calculated the average in the following .",
    "researches have shown that subgraphs or motifs are the building blocks of complex networks and the superfamilies of networks can be defined as the network motif patterns of occurrence @xcite .",
    "distinct from the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient , the occurrence frequency of small subgraphs or motifs can characterize the local structural properties of real - world networks and then map the relation between the function and the local structure of real - world systems @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite observed the superfamily phenomenon in the nearest - neighbor networks constructed from different time series .",
    "they also found that the distribution of network motif ranks can be used to distinguish and to characterize different types of dynamics in periodic , chaotic and periodic with noise processes @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the frequencies of occurrence of the six motifs of size @xmath85 within the horizontal visibility graphs constructed from fbms .    in this work ,",
    "the constructed recurrence networks are connected and undirected , so here we only consider motifs with 4 nodes as in ref . @xcite .",
    "7 shows all six different network motifs of size @xmath85 in connected and undirected networks .",
    "these motifs reflects the different local structure characteristics in network .",
    "there are two extreme blocks : motif @xmath86 and motif @xmath87 .",
    "the motif @xmath86 means the most irregular and nontransitive structure that will appear if the node is connected to its three neighbor nodes , but these neighbors are not connected to each other . on the contrary , the motif @xmath87 indicates the most transitive structure that will appear if the three neighbors are also connected to each other .",
    "the relative occurrence frequencies of motifs @xcite are defined as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the number of motif @xmath90 in the network . after constructing the recurrence networks based on the recurrence plot method described above , we calculated the occurrence frequencies of various motifs within the recurrence networks by the network motif detection tool provided by milo _",
    "_ @xcite . for each hurst index @xmath1 , which runs from 0.40 to 0.95 with a step of 0.05 ,",
    "100 realizations of fbms were generated .",
    "then we constructed these time series into 100 recurrence networks and obtained the average of @xmath91 .    in fig .",
    "8 , we rearrange the relative occurrence frequencies @xmath92 in descending order for different hurst indices @xmath1 . as we can see from fig .",
    "8 , these seemingly unrelated recurrence networks are divided into two superfamilies based on the very similar motif rank distributions .",
    "8(a ) shows a superfamily determined by the motif rank @xmath93 , which includes the recurrence networks constructed from fbms with hurst indices @xmath94 , and @xmath95 . the rest of recurrence networks with hurst indices @xmath96 belong to another superfamily and the motif rank pattern is @xmath97 ( fig .",
    "8(b ) ) . in addition , three particular motifs @xmath98 , and @xmath87 play an important role in the classification of recurrence networks we constructed because their order determines the motif rank distributions .",
    "a similar phenomenon was also observed in refs .",
    "they gave a detailed explanation for this common phenomenon .",
    "9 further illustrates the dependence of @xmath92 with respect to the hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "more specially , the occurrence frequency @xmath99 of motif @xmath86 strictly monotonically decreases with the increase of the hurst index @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "in contrast to the motif @xmath86 , the frequencies @xmath100 and @xmath101 increase with the increase of the hurst index @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "9(e ) and fig .",
    "we also note that the fluctuation of the frequencies @xmath102 is comparatively small in fig .",
    "9(d ) , which means that the motif @xmath103 almost does not appear in all of the recurrence networks .",
    "these results indicate that there are more regular and transitive structures in the networks when the hurst index @xmath1 varies from @xmath104 to @xmath105 .",
    "that is to say , the fully transitive motif @xmath87 will be common in these recurrence networks constructed from the fbm series with large hurst index @xmath1 than the ones with small hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "on the contrary , the irregular and nontransitive structure such as @xmath86 will be more common for these network with small hurst index @xmath1 .",
    "these trends are roughly coincide with the ones in the previous subsection .",
    "it should be noted that two triples @xmath76 and @xmath77 in fig .",
    "5 are just two motifs with @xmath106 nodes in undirected network . measuring and analyzing the density distribution of the motifs with @xmath85 nodes",
    "may be seen as a generalization of the aforementioned transitivity concept .",
    "therefore , as mentioned in the previous subsection , we can give a similar explanation for these trends in this subsection .",
    "in this sense , recurrence networks capture the correlation of the associated fbms .",
    "in 1967 , mandelbrot introduced the fractal idea in ref . @xcite . in fractal geometry , a fractal object is self - similar because it contains small parts similar to the whole @xcite .",
    "recently , the fractal and self - similarity properties of complex networks have been studied extensively in various fields and systems @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite found that many real - world networks such as the world - wide web ( www ) , social networks , protein - protein interaction ( ppi ) networks and cellular networks consist of self - repeating patterns .",
    "they also believed that these complex networks are self - similar under a certain length - scale .",
    "after the small - world character and scale - free property , self - similarity has become the third basic characteristic of complex networks .    to gain further understanding of complex networks , numerous algorithms have been developed to calculate the fractal dimension of complex networks .",
    "@xcite proposed to calculate the fractal dimension via a box - counting method .",

    "if no newly burned vertex is found , then this box is discarded .",
    "3 .   repeat steps ( i ) and ( ii ) until all vertices in the entire network are assigned to their respective boxes .    in this work , we simulated fbm series with different hurst indices @xmath1 ranging from 0.4 to 0.95 in the step of 0.05 .",
    "for each @xmath1 , we simulated 100 fbm time series and then constructed the obtained series into 100 recurrence networks .",
    "apparent power - law behaviors of the two typical empirical recurrence networks constructed from fbm series with different hurst indices are shown in fig .",

    "11 , the average fractal dimension @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , it is surprising that the curve shows a nice linear relationship : @xmath114 which approximates the theoretical relationship between hurst index @xmath1 and the fractal dimension @xmath20 of the graph of fbm @xmath115 .",
