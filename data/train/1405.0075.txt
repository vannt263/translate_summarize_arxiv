    "it is worth noting that these conditions do not depend on the hilbert space @xmath14 unlike nearly all existing results in the literature .",
    "following completion of the first draft version of this note , the author became aware of a space - time regularity result in a recent article by @xcite ( see theorem 1.2-(1 ) in that article ) which seems comparable to our main result .",
    "however , their approach is much more involved as it is largely based on mcintosh s @xmath15-functional calculus and r - boundedness techniques .",
    "the approach in this short note is simpler as it relies only on regularity results for stochastic convolutions in m - type 2 banach spaces by @xcite .",
    "we argue that , using the factorization method introduced by @xcite and fixed - point arguments as in @xcite , this result can be easily generalized to mild solutions of semi - linear stochastic pdes with multiplicative cylindrical noise , linear growth coefficients and zero dirichlet - boundary conditions , as well as neumann - type boundary conditions .",
