    "we have been using wave functions reconstructed from lattice monte carlo simulations of qcd to calculate the masses of orbital excitations .",
    "we have also been trying to use wave functions as a tool for hadronic phenomenology .",
    "our work has been presented in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "we present a synopsis of it here .",
    "we will also comment on issues relevant to excited state spectroscopy which came up during discussions during the conference .",
    "lattice qcd is unique among the subfields of physics in focussing only on ground state spectroscopy .",
    "some p - wave states masses are regularly measured in staggered simulations because they are the odd parity partners of `` ordinary '' states : the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are examples of such pairs . in nonrelativistic",
    "qcd , lepage and thacker@xcite have computed the masses of @xmath2 and @xmath3 states ( without including spin effects ) .",
    "the ape collaboration@xcite measured masses of some p - wave mesons in quenched simulations at @xmath4 , but had difficulty in continuing their program to higher @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "recently , the fermilab group has presented a calculation of the 1p-1s splitting in charmonium , which they use to fix the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "we construct orbitally excited states by using interpolating fields which couple only to a specific angular momentum eigenstate , which are projected onto zero momentum and which are of large spatial extent to maximize overlap with the state .    at the @xmath6 end of the correlation function",
    "we use an operator which depends on the relative separation of the quarks , a `` wave function''@xcite .",
    "the wave function @xmath7 of a hadron h in a gauge g is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are quantum mechanical operators which create a quark and an antiquark at locations @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "( we have suppressed dirac and color indices . ) our correlation function is constructed from convolutions of quark and antiquark propagators @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16 operator . at large @xmath17 if the mass of the hadron is @xmath18 , then @xmath19 and so by plotting @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 we can reconstruct the wave function up to an overall constant .",
    "we measure the mass of a state by convoluting @xmath22 with some test function which further projects out the desired state : @xmath23    at @xmath16 we take an operator which is separable in the coordinates of the quarks . for a meson we use @xmath24 in order to couple to orbital excitations we take @xmath25 to be an s - wave and @xmath26 to be some orbitally excited state with angular momentum @xmath27 , centered around some specified coordinate .",
    "this state is a linear superposition of a @xmath28 @xmath29 orbital excitation and a state whose center of mass momentum is nonzero .",
    "( this is the familiar `` translation mode '' of a shell model state . )",
    "convoluting quark propagators as in eqn .",
    "[ eq : convol ] removes the @xmath30 state and gives us the wave function of the @xmath28 @xmath29 state .",
    "our trial states @xmath31 were chosen to be gaussians times an appropriate spherical harmonic .",
    "we used coulomb gauge .",
    "we discussed with d. richards whether p - wave spectroscopy could be done with other sources and concluded that one could use wuppertal sources ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : the s - wave @xmath32 could be the inverse of @xmath33 and the p - wave @xmath32 could be @xmath34 .",
    "this would eliminate any need to gauge fix or perform convolutions .",
    "we have to say , however , that we prefer the possibility of reconstructing the sink wave function at the end of the calculations ; we have seen too many qcd simulations where one discovered at the end of a lot of data collection that one s operators were not as effective at producing the desired state as one would have wished .",
    "there were several things that we should have done differently , which should be part of a second generation simulation .",
    "first , we only recorded wave function information on a small number of time slices .",
    "we took a trial function @xmath35 and recorded the @xmath36 resulting from eqn .",
    "[ eq : integ ] .",
    "had we possessed wave function information on all sites , we could have reconstructed the wave function from the large @xmath17 @xmath37 and used it as the @xmath35 in eqn .",
    "[ eq : integ ] .",
    "this might have given a better signal .",
    "second , we used sources which were angular momentum eigenstates only for the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 mesons , and the highest angular momentum baryons .",
    "the other states are merely eigenstates of @xmath42 .",
    "this was done to limit the number of propagators constructed .",
    "we could have fully reconstructed the sink angular momentum wave function , obtaining correlators which were eigenfunctions of @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "we used nonrelativistic source and sink wave functions ( upper dirac components in bjorken - drell basis ) .",
    "this is probably good enough for heavier masses but might not be the optimal choice for very light quarks .",
    "finally , in excited state baryon spectroscopy one must deal with the fact that many states with the same quantum numbers are present in a multiplet .",
    "for example , there are two @xmath44 nucleons in the @xmath45 [ 70 ] of su(6 ) .",
    "separating these states presents a technical challenge .",
    "our simulations used wilson fermions on @xmath46 lattices at a coupling @xmath47 , in quenched approximation , with 80 lattices for p waves and 50 for d waves .",
    "they were performed at the pittsburgh supercomputing center .",
    "we present a picture of a d - wave hadron in fig .",
    "[ fig : blah ] ; a slice through a @xmath40 meson .",
    "the light regions are where the wave function is large and positive ; in the dark regions it is large and negative .",
    "the characteristic quadrupole lobes are obvious .",
    "the orbitally excited mesons and baryons are much larger than the s - wave states .",
    "we were able to see a hint of p wave fine structure splitting at our heaviest quark mass .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : finestructure ] . with a nominal lattice spacing of @xmath48 gev",
    "there is a remarkable similarity to charmonium , where the @xmath49 state is at 3415 mev and the other states are at about 3500 mev .    as a global way of presenting our results",
    "we show the `` wilson fermion wallet card '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : walletcard ] .",
    "we show s - wave mesons and baryons along with the @xmath38 , @xmath50 , @xmath40 , and @xmath51 excited states ( labelled `` p '' , `` p '' , `` d '' , and `` d '' . )    we extracted a lattice spacing by lattice determinations of the @xmath38 and @xmath52 states at @xmath53 , 0.145 , and 0.152 and extrapolating their masses linearly in @xmath54 .",
    "( we used the data of ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath55 vector meson ) .",
    "we determined the lattice spacing by fitting the extrapolated masses to the @xmath56 and @xmath57 masses .",
    "this gave a charm hopping parameter of @xmath58 and an inverse lattice spacing of @xmath59 mev .",
    "( determining the lattice spacing from our proton mass would give @xmath60 mev ; from the rho , @xmath61 mev . )",
    "the extrapolated common d - meson mass is then 3.99(16 ) mev , where the error is only from the extrapolation .",
    "the @xmath62 @xmath63 state is at 3.77 gev but its mass is influenced by the nearby @xmath64 threshold .",
    "model calculations@xcite of d - wave states ( some of which are narrow since their decays to @xmath64 are forbidden ) give masses of 3.81 to 3.84 gev .",
    "at this value of the lattice spacing our @xmath65 mass splitting at @xmath55 is 63 mev ; in charmonium the corresponding number is 145 mev .",
    "this is a little different from the fermilab procedure of extracting a lattice spacing from the @xmath39 splitting from the center of gravity of the s - wave mesons .",
    "we made our choice because we have a better signal in the @xmath38 channel ; anyway , the most robust experimental p - wave spectroscopy pretty much across the board is in the @xmath38 channel .",
    "while wave functions in a smooth gauge have clearly demonstrated their worth as interpolating fields for spectroscopy , it is still not clear if they have any real physical significance .",
    "we compared charge radii computed using wave functions with form factor data .",
    "the calculation is simple : for mesons one computes @xmath66 and there is an analogous equation for baryons .",
    "we found that @xmath67 computed from eqn .",
    "[ eq : char ] was about a factor of four to six smaller than the observed pion or nucleon charge radius .",
    "however , at the same time , we saw that the ratio of neutron to proton charge radii was negative and about the same size as the experimental ratio .",
    "apparently this negative neutron charge radius arises because the two @xmath68 quarks have a larger relative separation than the @xmath69 quark does from either of the @xmath68 s .",
    "this effect is easy to explain as being due to the color hyperfine interaction ( compare ref .",
    "we show an example of this ratio in fig .",
    "[ fig : radius ] .",
    "the methods we describe here can and should be used for a large scale calculation of the spectroscopy of orbital excitations .",
    "we believe our signal for p - wave states is only limited by statistics .",
    "however , the physical meaning of the wave function remains obscure .",
    "this work was supported by the u. s. department of energy .",
    "simulations were performed at the pittsburgh supercomputing center .",
