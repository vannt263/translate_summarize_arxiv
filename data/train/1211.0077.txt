    "according to the latest compilation of known galactic open clusters ( i.e. , open clusters and galactic structure , version 3.2 , http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/@xmath4wilton ; dias et al .",
    "2012 ) , now numbering over 2000 , old clusters with an age of @xmath17 1 gyr are about 15% of the sample accounting for a small fraction of the total open cluster population .",
    "this could be explained by the process of disruptive encounters with massive molecular clouds in the galactic disk , which can easily destroy a typical open cluster ( spitzer 1958 ) . assuming a uniform destruction rate , the current census of old clusters implies that there once was a significant number of very old open clusters in the galactic disk .",
    "combined with the galactic positions , their ages and metallicities provide a direct panoramic view of the early stages of formation and chemical evolution of the galactic disk .",
    "these old clusters are also the key objects which can provide a possible link between old disk populations and the ancient galactic globular clusters ( friel 1995 ) .    given their practical importance in the study of galaxy formation and evolution , several notable open cluster survey programs ( i.e. , wiyn open cluster study ( wocs ) , mathieu 2000 ; cfht open star cluster survey , kalirai et al .",
    "2001a ; southern open cluster study ( socs ) , kinemuchi et al .",
    "2010 ; and bologna open clusters chemical evolution ( bocce ) project , bragaglia & tosi 2006 ; etc . ) have been initiated and are actively being carried out for systematic investigations of the physical properties of the galactic open clusters using homogeneous data sets .    as a part of our continuing efforts in the wocs series of studies , here we present a comprehensive photometric study of the old open cluster , ngc 6819 using 1@xmath0@xmath11@xmath0 field @xmath2 mosaic ccd imaging .",
    "ngc 6819 is a relatively well studied open cluster ( age @xmath4 2.5 gyr ; rosvick & vandenberg 1998 , hereafter rv98 ; kalirai et al . 2001b , hereafter k01 , and references therein ) , but in recent years , it has gained renewed prominence because this cluster is one of the target fields of nasa s @xmath18 satellite mission .",
    "a couple of analyses of astroseismic data obtained from @xmath18 observations of red giant branch stars ( rgbs ) in ngc 6819 have already been published ( stello et al .",
    "2010 ; basu et al .",
    "these studies provide model - independent estimates of the basic physical parameters ( i.e. , mass , radius , and log @xmath19 ) of rgb stars in ngc 6819 .",
    "the 1@xmath0@xmath11@xmath0 ccd imaging presented herein is unique because it provides the largest sky coverage yet of ngc 6819 and its environs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides a short description of the observations and data reduction ; in section 3 , we present the results of our analyses : section 3.1 provides a detailed explanation of the cluster centering algorithm we have employed ; section 3.2 describes general trends in the cluster and field color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) ; section 3.3 explains our adoption of the reddening and metallicity values for the cluster , while section 3.4 illustrates the measurements of distance and age ; section 3.5 provides a full description of the dynamical evolution of ngc 6819 using its surface density profile , luminosity and mass functions ; section 3.6 describes our attempt to detect variable blue stragglers ; lastly section 4 presents a summary of our results .",
    "the observations of ngc 6819 were obtained at the wiyn 0.9 m telescope at kitt peak national obsevatory on the night of 2000 july 9 .",
    "table 1 shows a log of the observations . the noao mosaic imager ( 8176@xmath18192 pixel@xmath20 )",
    "was used at the f/7.5 secondary to obtain a field of view of approximately 1@xmath0@xmath11@xmath0 with a plate scale of 0.4 arcsec pixel@xmath21 .",
    "the typical gain setting was 2.9 e@xmath22 adu@xmath21 with an average readout noise of 5.7 e@xmath22 .",
    "the images were centered on the cluster and dithered between exposures to minimize errors due to flat - fielding and cosmetic defects as well as to fill in the gaps between the eight ccds that comprise the mosaic imager .",
    "the observed cluster images ( 15 @xmath3 + 15 @xmath23 ) were reduced following the standard procedure using the daophot ii photometry package ( stetson & harris 1988 ) . ignoring the bad pixels , saturated stars , and defects , we selected about @xmath4 1000 fairly bright , isolated stars in order to construct a high signal - to - noise point spread function ( psf ) for each image .",
    "a psf was constructed so that its shape varies quadratically with position across the field of view .",
    "then , the instrumental magnitudes and positions of star - like objects were derived by fitting this psf to all detected profiles using the allstar task .",
    "ccccccc & & & & exposure & & + & obs date & filter & & ( sec ) & air mass & + & 2000 july 9 & @xmath3 & & 7@xmath150 & 1.05 & + & & @xmath3 & & 8@xmath1200 & 1.05 & + & & @xmath23 & & 7@xmath150 & 1.05 & + & & @xmath23 & & 8@xmath1200 & 1.05 & +    the next step included the calculation of aperture corrections for each image .",
    "to do so , @xmath4 1000 bright stars were selected from each frame .",
    "all stars except these selected aperture correction stars were subtracted from the frame , at which point , photometry was performed on each aperture correction star using a large aperture size .",
    "the aperture correction was calculated by measuring the difference between the psf magnitude and the total magnitude .",
    "we checked the degree of variation of the aperture correction with position on the image .",
    "there were no clear patterns or systematic variations in the aperture correction values with position on the images .",
    "therefore we did not make any additional corrections for this effect .",
    "the calibration of the instrumental magnitudes was performed using standardized photometry of ngc 6819 provided by sarrazine et al .",
    "the equations used for the transformation are the following :    @xmath24    @xmath25    in this formulation , the instrumental magnitudes corrected for exposure time are shown as the lower case symbols , while the uppercase letters represent the standard system .",
    "the @xmath26 errors of the fits in the @xmath3 and @xmath23 passband equations were 0.016 mag and 0.018 mag , respectively .",
    "we compared our photometry with literature data from rv98 and k01 .",
    "for the stars cross - identified in all three studies ( rv98 , k01 , and this study ) , the @xmath3 magnitude differences ( this study - literature ) were calculated .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "1 . in particular",
    ", the two upper panels show the magnitude differences as a function of @xmath3 magnitude from the present study , while the lower panels exhibit the magnitude differences as a function of @xmath27 color from this study . the comparison in fig .",
    "1 indicates that our photometry shows good agreement with those of rv98 and k01 .",
    "the systematic differences in @xmath3 magnitude are of the order of 0.015 mag to rv98 , and -0.035 mag to k01 .",
    "we begin our analysis of ngc 6819 by determining the position of the cluster center .",
    "locating an accurate cluster center is an important initial step for deriving robust physical parameters of star clusters .",
    "for instance , faulty centering would artificially flatten the inner part of the surface density profile of a star cluster , and this can cause significant systematic errors in any structural parameters such as core / tidal radii and total mass , and as a result important information on the dynamical evolution of the cluster could be compromised .",
    "the centering of galactic open clusters is generally less straightforward than galactic globular clusters because the former tend to be more asymmetric than the latter . in order to avoid significant biases in the centering , we employed three independent centering algorithms , and took the average of these results to derive an accurate center for the cluster .",
    "first , we used well - photometered stars which passed our stellarity criteria using the image - shape statistics provided by daophot ii ( i.e. , 0.2 @xmath28 sharp @xmath28 0.5 , -0.2 @xmath28 round @xmath28 0.2 , @xmath29@xmath30 @xmath28 2.0 ) .",
    "we counted these stars within narrow bands ( 80 pixels wide ) in both the horizontal ( x ) and vertical ( y ) directions across the images .",
    "these counts are shown in fig .",
    "2 . we adopted the location at which the counts reached a maximum as the ( x , y ) position of the cluster center .",
    "the second centering algorithm we employed is called the `` four quadrants method '' ( i.e. , section 3 of k01 ) .",
    "we adopted the ( x , y ) location from the previous method as an initial estimate of the cluster center .",
    "then we counted the number of stars in four equal quadrants around this center .",
    "we repeated the star counting by randomly moving the ( x , y ) position of the center within a small circular area around the initial center until the number of stars in all four quadrants agreed .",
    "finally , we implemented a monte carlo centering method similar to the algorithm employed by mackey & gilmore ( 2003 ) .",
    "we first placed a boxed area with a size ( 1200@xmath11200 pixels ) large enough to cover the central region of the cluster .",
    "next , we randomly selected an ( x , y ) position as a test center .",
    "we calculated the surface density in a circular area with a radius of 600 pixels about this test center .",
    "we repeated this random selection of the test center location 10,000 times .",
    "we consider the ( x , y ) position that yields the highest surface density as the cluster center .",
    "the results of these three independent centering algorithms agree reasonably well with each other .",
    "the average value of the ( x , y ) positions provides our final estimate of the cluster center ; we find ( x , y)=(3297.86 , 4770.56 ) or ( ra(j2000)=19:41:16.43 , decl(j2000)=+40:11:48.88 ) .",
    "our estimate of the centering errors in the x and y directions is @xmath4 25 pixels ( 10.6@xmath31 ) each .",
    "our estimation of the cluster center shows excellent agreement with the recent calculation by hole et al .",
    "( 2009 ; ra=19:41:17.5 , decl=+40:11:47 ; hearafter h09 ) obtained using stars with moderate - to - high membership probability ( @xmath32 ) ; however , it differs slightly from the center published by k01 ( i.e. , ra=19:41:17.7 , decl=+40:11:17 ) by @xmath4 30@xmath31 .",
    "our tests have revealed that this difference is not significant enough to cause serious biases in the structural parameters of the cluster determined herein .",
    "therefore we will adopt our value for the cluster center in the remainder of our analysis .",
    "figure 3 presents deep @xmath2 color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in the region of ngc 6819 .",
    "the two upper panels show cmds for the cluster field defined by its visual extent ( @xmath33 ) and the control field acquired from the outskirts ( @xmath34 ) of the cluster with an area equal to that of the cluster field .",
    "these two cmds provide useful insight to understand the degree of field star contamination ( see section 3.5.1 for detail ) . in order to see the characteristic features of the cluster more clearly in the cmd , we extract stars from a central area ( @xmath35 ) centered around the cluster as shown in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "3 ; this shows a clean red giant branch ( rgb ) extending @xmath41.5 mag brightward from a well - populated helium burning red clump ( rc ) at @xmath3@xmath413 mag .",
    "there is a sparsely populated subgiant branch , a well - developed main sequence ( ms ) from @xmath3@xmath414.5 mag down to our photometric limit of @xmath3@xmath421 mag , and the signature of equal mass binary stars ( 0.75 mag brighter than the ms ) .",
    "we note , however , that the observed equal - mass binary sequence in our @xmath2 cmd is not as prominent as that of k01 .",
    "the relative sparseness of our binary sequence combined with the degree of field star contamination made obtaining a robust estimate of the cluster binary fraction challenging .",
    "therefore , we have decided to adopt the result of k01 ( binary fraction @xmath4 11% ) for the fraction of equal - mass binaries in ngc 6819 .",
    "we also see the presence of a number of blue straggler stars ( bss ) , which are more luminous and bluer than the ms turnoff .",
    "bsss are rejuvenated massive stars which likely form via stellar mergers either due to dynamical collisions of two ms stars or through the coalescence of close binaries , and mass transfer of an evolved star onto the less - massive ms partner in binary systems ( glebbeek et al .",
    "some bsss exhibit pulsation properties which obey period - luminosity and period - luminosity - color relations similar to those of classical cepheids ( mateo 1993 ) . the existence and pulsation properties of the bss population in old galactic open clusters might shed some light on their formation mechanism , and role in the dynamical evolution of the host cluster .",
    "we will discuss the membership and physical properties of the bss population of ngc 6819 in section 3.6 .      in order to derive the cluster age accurately by fitting theoretical isochrones to the observed cmd , we need well - determined cluster parameters such as reddening and metallicity",
    ". the early measurements of the interstellar reddening toward ngc 6819 in the 1970s spanned a substantial range between high ( @xmath36@xmath40.30 : lindoff 1972 ; auner 1974 ) and low ( @xmath50.12 : burkhead 1971 ) values .",
    "however as more observations of ngc 6819 have been accumulated , the reddening measurements from various independent studies have converged to the relatively low value of @xmath36@xmath40.15 .",
    "the main reason for the high reddening measurements in the early studies is likely attributed to the photographic observations in the @xmath37 passband , which was known to be of low photometric quality .    for the present study",
    ", we have adopted the reddening and metallicity values ( @xmath50.14@xmath80.04;@xmath6=$]+0.09@xmath80.03 dex ) of ngc 6819 from the measurements of bragaglia et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter b01 ) . using effective temperatures of three rc stars in ngc 6819 derived from line excitation , which is a reddening - free index , b01 measured the interstellar reddening toward the cluster .",
    "the reddening was calculated by comparing the observed @xmath38 colors with the intrinsic colors computed using the measured temperatures .",
    "any possible zero - point offset in the intrinsic colors derived by model atmospheres was also corrected using a sample of 12 bright rc stars with accurate @xmath39 parallaxes .",
    "they selected this comparison sample to be similar to the stars of ngc 6819 in temperature and metallicity .",
    "b01 s measurement of the interstellar reddening toward ngc 6819 agrees very well with other independent studies ( burkhead 1971 ; rv98 ; k01 ; kang & ann 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , their study appears to be the lone high - dispersion spectroscopic analysis of this cluster .",
    "it is for this reason that we consider the reddening and metallicity values of b01 to be the most robust measurements for ngc 6819 to date .",
    "applying the adopted values of the cluster reddening and metallicity in the previous section , we generated a set of isochrones using the dartmouth stellar evolution database ( dotter et al .",
    "2007 , 2008(d08 ) ) .",
    "the database program handles convection by following the general principles of the standard mixing length theory and a solar - calibrated mixing length , @xmath40=1.938 .",
    "convective core overshooting is treated in the same fashion as the @xmath41 models developed by demarque et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ; the amount of convective core overshooting is parameterized as a multiple of the pressure scale height ( @xmath42 ) , and is a function of stellar mass and composition .",
    "the database program assigns 0.05@xmath42 of overshooting for the minimum stellar mass of 0.1@xmath15 ; then the amount of overshooting is linearly ramped from this value ( 0.05@xmath42 ) with an increment of 0.1@xmath42 as the stellar mass increases by 0.1@xmath15 ; models with masses greater than or equal to the minimum plus 0.2@xmath15 receive 0.2 @xmath42 of overshooting .",
    "the database uses a grid of phoenix model atmospheres ( hauschildt et al .",
    "1999a , 1999b ) for the range of @xmath432,000 to 10,000 @xmath44 and log @xmath450.5 to 5.5 to derive the surface boundary condition ( bc ) .",
    "the computation of phoenix model atmosphere grids covers the wide range of metallicity and @xmath46-element ratio ( @xmath47 < + 0.5 $ ] ; @xmath48 < + 0.8 $ ] ) .",
    "the effects of helium enhancement to the physical structure and the stellar spectrum are also considered in the model calculation .",
    "we adopted the solar values of the @xmath46-element ratio and he content ( @xmath49=$]0.0 ; @xmath500.27 ) for the calculation of the isochrones .",
    "a series of theoretical isochrones were calculated for a fixed metallicity of @xmath6=$ ] + 0.09 dex , and ages ranging from 1 gyr to 4 gyr .",
    "the interpolation routine in the database produces isochrones with a fine age spacing of 0.1 gyr . doing so allows for more precise age constraints .",
    "these theoretical isochrones were transformed into the johnson - cousins photometric system using the filter transmission curves defined by bessell ( 1990 ) . adopting the reddening , @xmath50.14 , and the initial estimate of distance modulus , @xmath5112.30 taken from k01 , we shifted the theoretical isochrones in the absolute magnitude - intrinsic color plane into the observed color - magnitude plane .",
    "then , we varied the age and distance until a satisfactory fit was achieved between the observed cmd and the isochrones . figure 4 shows our isochrone fits to the observed data of ngc 6819 .",
    "we see that the 2.6 gyr darthmouth isochrone ( red ) with a refined distance modulus , @xmath5212.36 yields the best description of the observed data . for comparison",
    "we also plot a best - fitting padova isochrone ( cyan ) calculated from their latest stellar evolution code , parsec ( bressan et al .",
    "2012 ; b12 ) for the given reddening , distance and age of the cluster .",
    "the padova isochrone agrees well with the main features of the observed cluster cmd , such as the rgb , red clump ( rc ) , and msto .",
    "however it starts to show offsets in the lower main - sequence ( @xmath3 @xmath17 18.5 mag ) in the sense that the isochrone becomes systematically bluer than the observed sequence .",
    "the two model sequences also show a marginal offset at the subgiant branch , and upper - ms hook which is a characteristic feature among the old galactic open clusters partly due to the effects of convective core overshooting .",
    "this offset is likely caused by the different treatment of convective core overshooting in each of the stellar evolution codes .",
    "the given amount of error ( @xmath80.04 mag ) in the adopted reddening value yields a change in the derived distance modulus of @xmath80.1 mag and a change in the derived age of @xmath80.6 gyr for a fixed @xmath6 $ ] value of 0.09 dex . a change in @xmath6 $ ] of @xmath80.1 dex results in a change in the derived age of @xmath80.3 gyr and distance modulus of @xmath80.08 mag for the adopted @xmath36 value of 0.14 mag .",
    "this best - fitting darthmouth isochrone seems to reproduce most of the characteristic features of the cluster cmd from the tip of the rgb down to the faintest low mass ms stars .",
    "our estimates for the age and distance modulus of ngc 6819 agree well with those determined from the recent analysis of basu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . just like in this study , basu et al . (",
    "2011 ) adopted the same reddening and metallicity values from bragaglia et al .",
    "they measured a cluster age of 2.4 gyr and a distance modulus of @xmath5112.32 by employing a model - independent analysis of the astro - seismic quantity , @xmath53 using data obtained by nasa s @xmath18 mission .",
    "our result is also consistent with previous estimates in the literature ( @xmath5112.35 , rv98 ; 12.30 , k01 ; 12.11 , kang & ann 2002 ; 12.30 , h09 ) .",
    "the cmd in fig .",
    "5 shows a direct comparison of our photometry for ngc 6819 and that of m67 ( montgomery et al . 1993 ) , which is one of the most studied old open clusters .",
    "this provides an alternative test of our adopted reddening and distance as well as the derived age for ngc 6819 . in order to perform this direct cmd comparison",
    ", we need to adopt a reddening and distance for m67 , for which we rely on the results of sarajedini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who found @xmath50.04 , @xmath519.69 .",
    "these values along with the reddening and distance of ngc 6819 ( @xmath50.14 , @xmath5112.36 ) allow us to produce the cmd comparison shown in fig .",
    "we see that there is a nearly exact match of the unevolved main sequences of these two clusters , and a reasonable separation of the main - sequence turnoffs predicted by the age difference ( @xmath54@xmath42 gyr ) between them .",
    "the red giant branches are also very well aligned indicating that the two clusters have similar metallicities within roughly 0.1 - 0.2 dex .",
    "thus this cmd comparison strengthens the validness of our estimates of the distance modulus and age for ngc 6819 .",
    "now we direct our attention to the dynamical properties of the cluster .",
    "these have previously been investigated by k01 and kang & ann ( 2002 ) .",
    "k01 conducted a wide field ( 42@xmath10@xmath128@xmath10 ) @xmath55 imaging survey of ngc 6819 using the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) equipped with the cfh12k mosaic ccd .",
    "the structural parameters such as the core and tidal radii ( @xmath111.75 pc ; @xmath1217 pc ) of the cluster were derived through a king model fit to the observed density profile constructed with star counts .",
    "they found an almost flat present - day luminosity function , and the clear signature of mass segregation from the analysis of radial cmds and mass functions ; their results indicate that ngc 6819 has dynamically evolved , and now contains mostly high - mass stars in the inner regions and lower mass stars at larger radii .",
    "subsequently , kang & ann ( 2002 ) presented @xmath2 ccd photometry of the cluster .",
    "their observational data covered an area of 18@xmath10@xmath118@xmath10 on the sky , which is smaller than k01 s field but still covered the visual extent of the cluster . by analyzing the derived luminosity function and radial density profile , they confirmed k01 s result that the cluster clearly exhibits mass segregation as a result of its dynamical evolution",
    ".    the ngc 6819 photometry presented herein represents the widest field coverage of this cluster to date . as such",

    "this provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the dynamical structure of the cluster in great detail . in the following two subsections ,",

    "6 includes corrections for photometric incompleteness ( see the next section for detail ) and for the density of the background field .",
    "the average background density was calculated in the outskirts ( @xmath60 ) of the cluster .",

    "we employed a maximum likelihood method powered by a genetic algorithm pikaia ( charbonneau 1995 ) to derive the best - fit structural parameters of ngc 6819 .",

    "the quoted errors in @xmath64 and @xmath65 reflect the amount of errors propagated from the expected error of 0.10 mag in our distance modulus measurement .    next we can calculate the mass of the cluster within its tidal radius .",
    "accurate measurements of the current masses of star clusters are crucial for understanding cluster survival and destruction processes in the galactic disk . according to the classical theory of galactic dynamics",
    ", the tidal force exerted on star clusters reaches its maximum when the clusters are passing through their perigalactic positions .",
    "the tidal radius of a cluster is defined as the inner lagrangian point where the galactic gravitational potential exactly equals the gravitational potential of the cluster . using this definition of the tidal radius of a star cluster and",

    "this simple version of the formula has been used in the calculation of total cluster mass using the tidal radius obtained from fitting a king model to the observed surface density profile , or alternatively , the tidal radius by assuming the total mass of the cluster . however , both theoretical considerations and numerical computations ( innanen et al . 1983 ; keenan 1981 ) call for caution with regard to the use of this equation .",
    "this is because the tidal radius in this formula is not the same as the tidal radius derived from king model fitting to the observed surface density profile .",
    "the tidal radius calculated from the point - mass galactic model ( equation ( 4 ) ) refers to the semi - minor axis of the elongated tidal surface of the cluster , while the tidal radius obtained from the king model fitting represents the radius of the isothermal sphere at which the cluster stellar density vanishes into the galactic field .",

    "we need to correct for photometric incompleteness in order to properly interpret the cluster lf .",
    "this was done through a series of artificial star tests .",
    "we employed the addstar routine in daophot ii to generate @xmath42,000 artificial stars with known magnitude and position .",

    "we followed k01 s recipes for the estimation of the errors in the global luminosity and mass functions .",

    "<S> fitting theoretical isochrones with adopted values of the reddening and metallicity ( @xmath50.14 , @xmath6=+$]0.09 dex ) to the observed cmd yields a distance modulus of @xmath711.93@xmath80.10 and an age of @xmath4 2.6 gyr for ngc 6819 . </S>",
    "<S> our wide - field imaging reveals that ngc 6819 is larger in areal extent ( @xmath913@xmath10 ) than previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> the wide - field also benefits our estimate of the degree of field star contamination , and ultimately yields improved measurements of the structural parameters ( @xmath112.80@xmath10 , @xmath1238.2@xmath10 , and @xmath137@xmath10 ) and tidal mass of the cluster ( @xmath143542.4 @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the flattened luminosity and mass functions indicate that ngc 6819 has experienced mass segregation as a result of its dynamical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> our variability study of the cluster blue straggler star ( bss ) population using the welch - stetson variability index ( @xmath16 ) has revealed a number of variable bss candidates . </S>"
