    "multifractals have been largely employed in the characterization of time series .",
    "this tool have been successfully applied in many different areas as economics @xcite , meteorology @xcite , geology @xcite , or biomedical @xcite .",
    "several algorithms have been used to find the multifractal spectrum of the time - series , for instance , wavelet analysis @xcite and dfa ( detrended fluctuation analysis ) @xcite . however , despite the large use of multifractals as a time - series analysis technique there is no simple geometrical examples of multifractal sets .",
    "some years ago it was introduced a multifractal partition of the unit square @xcite .",
    "this mathematical object was originally developed to model multifractal heterogeneity in oil reservoirs and to study percolation on complex lattices .",
    "afterwards , a generalization of this object to random partitions was performed to improve the model @xcite . in this work",
    "we explore the unidimensional version of this model .",
    "indeed , the multifractal partition of the square , cube or hypercube are , in essence , derived from a multifractal partition of a line segment .",
    "cantor sets , peano curves or sierpinski models are very useful subjects to grasp the fundamentals of fractals . on the other side ,",
    "the study of multifractal sets lack simple geometrical examples .",
    "this paper intend to fulfill this vacancy in the literature .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath8 we introduce the partition of a line segment that produces a multifractal set .",
    "we focus our attention on the case of a constant cutting ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the binomial distribution naturally arises in the construction of the partition algorithm . in section @xmath9",
    "we analytically derive the multifractal spectrum @xmath5 of the partition and find its limit cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we use a method similar to the boxcounting algorithm . finally in section",
    "@xmath10 we give our final remarks .",
    "in this section we introduce a partition of a line segment .",
    "we expose the method of construction of the partition as a recursive algorithm .",
    "we call the sets at step @xmath2 as father sets respect to son - sets at step @xmath11 .",
    "each father set always give origin to two son sets .",
    "the sum of lengths of the son sets is equal to the length of the father set , that means , the dynamic rule of the algorithm is length preserving . at each step of the algorithm we use a ratio @xmath0 to perform the partition of the father sets . in the next paragraphs we will detail the initial steps of the algorithm , but the multifractal , that shall be shown in the next section , is properly defined in the limit of @xmath2 going to infinity .    in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show a representation of the five initial steps in the construction of our partition .",
    "the step @xmath12 corresponds to the segment of length @xmath13 itself . at step",
    "@xmath14 the segment is partitioned into two pieces of length @xmath15 and @xmath16 . at step @xmath17",
    "the two pieces are each one partitioned into two new sets giving origin to @xmath10 sets and so on . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we show the iteration step @xmath2 , the number of sets for each step @xmath18 and the partition length ( as a fraction of @xmath13 ) inside each step .",
    "we notice that the length distribution is trivially done by a binomial rule , that means , the partition gives raise , at step @xmath2 , to a binomial length distribution : @xmath19    .the main quantities of the algorithm of the partition of a segment line according to a ratio @xmath0 .",
    "the iteration step @xmath2 , the total number of sets at each step @xmath20 , the full length partition as a fraction of @xmath13 . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we remark some differences between the exposed process and the algorithm construction of cantor set and koch curve @xcite .",
    "initially the cited fractals do not conserve length along the dynamic formation , the measure divergence in these sets is originated in the algorithm process itself , the cantor set subtracts subsets and the koch adds subsets at each step . in addition , in these fractal models all sets , at the same step of their generating algorithm , have the same length . by that reason these models produce monofractal sets .",
    "we call @xmath1-sets the set of all elements , at the step @xmath2 , that has the same length @xmath21 . by construction",
    "there are @xmath4 elements in a @xmath1-set . in the next section , for the limit of @xmath22",
    "we will determine the fractal dimension of each @xmath1-set and characterize the set of all @xmath1-set as a multifractal object .    to find the length partition of a line segment in the case of variable @xmath0 we proceed as follows .",
    "consider that @xmath23 is present @xmath24 times at the partition and that at step @xmath2 we have @xmath25 . in this case the length distribution is done by : @xmath26    in figure [ fig1 ] we assume a fixed rule in the partition .",
    "each time a father set is cut into two new pieces the largest son set is always situated at the right position .",
    "we notice that this is an arbitrary choice that will not change the length distribution of the object . on the other side , the topology of the partition ( a subject that we do not consider in this paper ) will change since the neighborhood properties will change .",
    "we cite that the bidimensional version of the multifractal has a topological treatment @xcite that can not be easily extended to the unidimensional object .",
    "in fact , the topology of a line segment is sort of trivial since each open set in the segment has always two neighbours . in the cited work",
    "@xcite we report that the bidimensional multifractal version of the object we work in this paper has a power - law distribution of neighbours .",
    "in this section we estimate the fractal dimension for each @xmath1-set that results from the partition of a segment .",
    "we calculate the fractal dimension of each @xmath1-set , @xmath5 , with help of the definition : @xmath27 in this definition @xmath28 is the number of open balls , of size @xmath29 , necessary to cover a given @xmath1-set .    in order to use ( [ dnn ] )",
    "we generate a proper coverage of the segment @xmath13 . to create an adequate coverage of the partition we take at step one @xmath30 for @xmath31 integers .",
    "therefore @xmath0 is a rational number @xmath32 ( we take @xmath33 ) .",
    "in addition , at each step @xmath2 the size of the segment is @xmath34 and the size of the open balls used to cover the @xmath1-sets is : @xmath35    in this way , @xmath28 , the total length of each @xmath1-set is @xmath36 and as a result @xmath5 is done by : @xmath37    in figure [ fig2 ] we computationally test the finite size effect over the multifractal spectrum ( [ dk ] ) .",
    "we use as a case study @xmath38 and @xmath39 and as a consequence @xmath40 . in the simulations we take @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 to follow the convergence of the spectrum . in this figure",
    "we plot @xmath44 in the horizontal axis to compare the results of several @xmath2 .",
    "we observe in the data that in the limit of large @xmath2 the spectrum seems to touch the line @xmath45 which suggests that the @xmath1-set of largest dimension is dense in the line .",
    "it is interesting to estimate @xmath5 in the limits of @xmath1 going to @xmath46 and @xmath2 . using equation ( [ dk ] ) we calculate @xmath5 for @xmath47 : @xmath48 summarizing , we have : @xmath49 in a similar way we estimate : @xmath50    we use the notation @xmath51 instead of @xmath52 because he multifractal is only defined in the limit of @xmath53 , and therefore @xmath52 is in fact an accumulation point .",
    "it is worth to note that in the limit of @xmath51 or @xmath54 the fractal dimension is not necessarily @xmath46 .",
    "one could think that @xmath55 for @xmath52 because the multifractal of the corresponding @xmath1-set for @xmath52 is composed by just one point and the dimension of a single point is zero .",
    "this argument is not valid because the multifractal is only properly defined in the limit of @xmath22 , where the variable @xmath1 is not discrete , but continuous .",
    "we show the spectrum of fractal dimension for several ratios @xmath0 in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "we display in this plot the spectrum @xmath5 versus @xmath44 for some @xmath56 and @xmath57 as indicated in the figure . in this estimation",
    "we use @xmath58 . the relations ( [ eq5 ] ) ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "are verified in the curves of the figure .",
    "we find the maximum of @xmath5 for any @xmath0 using the property of the maximum of the binomial distribution @xcite . in this way",
    "the maximum of @xmath5 is at @xmath59 or @xmath60 . to compare this result with the maximum of curves in figure [ fig3 ] we use the normalization @xmath44 and",
    "the maximum is at @xmath0 .",
    "we check in the figure , for instance , that the maxima for the cases @xmath38 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are at positions @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "these values are indicated by successive arrows in the plot .",
    "the degenerate case @xmath65 corresponds to the standard partition of a segment which generates the unidimensional lattice . in this limit",
    "all elements of the partition have the same size . following this rule we cover the line segment with @xmath3 equal elements of length @xmath66 and the dimension of the object is not a fractal , indeed @xmath67 in this case there is just one @xmath1-set that trivially have the same dimension of the line segment itself .",
    "in this work we introduce an object that arises from an infinite partition of a line segment .",
    "we present the construction algorithm of the object as a recursive sequence . in the case of a constant partition ratio @xmath0 the length distribution of its elements , at step @xmath2 of the algorithm ,",
    "follows a binomial distribution . at step @xmath2 ,",
    "the partition is formed by @xmath3 sets grouped in @xmath68 @xmath1-sets , that means , sets whose elements share the same length @xmath69 . in the limit of @xmath53 each @xmath1-set is a monofractal set .",
    "the multifractal set is composed by the totality of infinite monofractal sets .",
    "in addition we find the fractal spectrum @xmath5 and estimate where is its maximum .",
    "finally we find the values of @xmath5 for the limits @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    in this work we adapted to a line segment an algorithm of generation of multifractal objects that was initially defined on a square .",
    "the route from two dimensions to one dimension is a challenge . at one side we loose the attractive idea of modeling bidimensional geological formations .",
    "otherwise , once we go to an unidimensional version of the problem some points became more clear : the generalization of this object to any dimension , its formation algorithm and the spectrum of fractal dimensions .",
    "we think we have also attained our aims by showing to a general reader an illustrative ans simple geometrical multifractal set",
    ". however , some questions about this multifractal set remain open .",
    "is the largest set of the multifractal dense in the line ?",
    "the simulations indicate a positive answer , but we lack a rigorous proof of that . following equation ( [ multidist ] ) , is there a simple spectrum of dimensions for the case of non constant partition ?",
    "the answer seems positive if we could define appropriate @xmath1-sets",
    ". a more general question would be : if the set of ratios @xmath23 in equation ( [ multidist ] ) follows a normal distribution , what will be the resulting multifractal ? we conjecture that this new object would be usefull as a benchmark to compare with empirical multifractals ."
