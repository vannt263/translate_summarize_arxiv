    "in the fermi energy domain ( 15 - 100 a.mev ) semi - peripheral heavy - ion collisions are characterized by the presence of ternary or quaternary reactions leading to the formation of a binary system with excited projectile - like ( plf ) and target - like ( tlf ) fragments strongly correlated with one or more imfs and light particles in the exit channel .",
    "the emission pattern of these reactions has shown that light charged particles ( lcp , z@xmath22 ) and imfs ( z@xmath33 ) are not entirely described by the statistical decay of the plf and tlf . in particular , light imfs ( z@xmath210 ) are emitted preferentially towards mid - rapidity region ( intermediate between plf and tlf rapidities ) .",
    "their velocity distributions display typical forward - backward asymmetry in the invariant cross section @xmath4 ( see , for example , fig .",
    "1e ) in section ii ) , indicating their dynamical origin @xcite .",
    "the term `` neck fragmentation '' is commonly used for such a type of events , because a neck - like structure is predicted to be formed between the two main residues ( plf and tlf ) , in the early stages of the reaction .",
    "transport model simulations @xcite have shown that imfs in the neck region are formed in dilute matter in contact with the plf and tlf residues . however , the probability to produce fragments at mid - rapidity depends on different variables , such as impact parameter , beam energy and isospin asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the effective interactions driving transport phenomena of neutrons and protons through the neck have been related to the slope ( density gradient ) and magnitude ( isospin gradient ) of the symmetry potential term of the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "thus , heavy ion collisions with projectiles and targets with different isospin asymmetries have been studied to probe the density dependence of the symmetry term of the eos ( `` asy - eos '' ) that is an important ingredient for nuclear structure and astrophysical phenomena @xcite .",
    "different observables , mainly based upon measurement of the neutron to proton ( n / z ) ratio of reactions products have shown sensitivity to the density dependence of the simmetry energy like isospin diffusion and equilibration @xcite , neutron to proton ratio measurements @xcite , transverse collective flow @xcite .",
    "neutron enrichment of lcps and imfs in the mid - rapidity region has been observed experimentally ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an excess of neutron ( isospin migration ) towards the dilute low - density region is predicted by transport simulations .",
    "this is determined by the slope of the density dependence of the symmetry energy , providing a drift contribution to the isospin transfer , thus producing neutron rich imfs at mid - rapidity @xcite .",
    "such neutron enrichment of the neck - like imfs has never consistently been used to pin down the time scale of the reaction dynamics and to constrain the theoretical simulations vs. the isospin asymmetry .",
    "indeed , a neutron enrichment of the neck region could be also affected by phenomena not strictly related to the isospin dynamics , like proximity effects in the decay of plf and tlf @xcite , or effects of reduced size of neck structures and the persistence of neutron - rich matter at the surface @xcite . as shown in @xcite the isospin drift and isospin diffusion",

    "@xcite a new method based on a three body analysis of fragment - fragment relative velocities has been introduced to calibrate the timescale of imfs emission in semi - peripheral collisions , thus probing the dynamics and chronology of fragment formation .    in this paper , the time scale ( chronology ) of imfs originating in ternary reactions is correlated with their isospin content by inspecting typical dynamical observable , such as the degree of alignment and relative velocity correlations .",

    "<S> we present a new experimental method to correlate the isotopic composition of intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) emitted at mid - rapidity in semi - peripheral collisions with the emission timescale : imfs emitted in the early stage of the reaction show larger values of @xmath0n / z@xmath1 isospin asymmetry , stronger angular anisotropies and reduced odd - even staggering effects in neutron to proton ratio @xmath0n / z@xmath1 distributions than those produced in sequential statistical emission . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects support the concept of isospin `` migration '' , that is sensitive to the density gradient between participant and quasi - spectator nuclear matter , in the so called neck fragmentation mechanism . by comparing the data to a stochastic mean field ( smf ) simulation </S>",
    "<S> we show that this method gives valuable constraints on the symmetry energy term of nuclear equation of state at subsaturation densities . </S>",
    "<S> an indication emerges for a linear density dependence of the symmetry energy . </S>"
