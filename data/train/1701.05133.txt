    "<S> for @xmath22 and fixed @xmath23 and @xmath20 , this relation is usually sought in the form of a power law : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 has a fundamental significance for the mechanisms underlying the transport of heat .    the classical theory of priestley @xcite , malkus @xcite and howard @xcite is based on the argument that as @xmath7 the dimensional heat flux should become independent of the depth of the cell , resulting in @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> a consequence of this scaling is that the conductive boundary layers ( bls ) at the upper and lower surfaces , which are separated by a well mixed interior , do not interact .    </S>",

    "<S> this artificial symmetry had two important effects on the flow field : ( 1 ) the production and release of the plumes from the roughness elements was in tandem , resulting in larger plumes ; and ( 2 ) the plumes traversed the vertical distance without encountering a large scale circulation in the interior region . </S>",
