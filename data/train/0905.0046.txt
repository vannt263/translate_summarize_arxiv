    "the quantum - mechanical uncertainty principle , first formulated @xcite in terms of the standard deviations of the position and momentum probability densities which characterize the quantum - mechanical states of one - dimensional single - particle systems , is fundamental to the understanding the electronic structure and properties of atoms and molecules .",
    "the position - momentum heisenberg uncertainty relation has been extensively tested for many three - dimensional systems @xcite , and some interesting properties have been found for central potentials ; namely , the heisenberg uncertainty product ( i ) does not depend on the potential strength for the bound states of homogeneous power - type potentials @xcite , and ( ii ) has a lower bound which has a quadratic dependence on the orbital quantum number @xcite .",
    "there exist formulations of the position - momentum uncertainty principle based on uncertainty measures other than the standard deviation , which are more stringent than the heisenberg relation .",
    "they are the uncertainty - like relationships based on , e.g. the shannon @xcite , rnyi @xcite and tsallis @xcite entropies , the fisher information @xcite and the modified lmc or shape complexity , which are found and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the scaling properties of the position - momentum uncertainty relations mentioned above for single particle systems with a wide variety of central potentials have recently been examined by using of the dimensional analysis of their associated schrdinger equation @xcite . in this letter",
    "we present the first comprehensive information - theoretic study on the hydrogenic - like atoms in the presence of external parallel magnetic and electric fields .",
    "in particular , we have considered the scaling properties of the heisenberg uncertainty measure ( i.e. the standard variation ) , the shannon , rnyi , tsallis , fisher information measures , and the shape complexity @xcite .",
    "the numerical validity of these scaling properties are presented .",
    "the predictive power of the presently obtained results on this statistical complexity is illustrated by taking the example of the most distinctive non - linear spectroscopic phenomenon , the avoided crossing of two energy levels with the same energy @xcite of a hydrogenic system in the presence of intense parallel magnetic and electric fields .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we analyze the scaling transformation of the energies and eigenfunctions which characterize the quantum - mechanical states of a hydrogenic atom in the presence of parallel magnetic and electric fields in section 2 , and the dimensional properties of their position and momentum heisenberg uncertainty measure in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we examine the scaling properties of the uncertainty relations associated with the following information - theoretic measures : shannon , rnyi and tsallis entropies and the fisher and onicescu informations as well as the shape complexity . finally , in section 5 , we compute the shape complexity for two different pairs of energy levels of a hydrogen atom under intense parallel magnetic and electric fields , which show avoided crossing phenomena",
    ". moreover , we check the validity of the corresponding scaling law obtained for this information measure in the previous section , and , most important , we show that this measure presents a peculiar mirror symmetry through the avoided crossing region .",
    "the latter implies that the shape complexity is a good indicator of this highly non - linear phenomena at the same level as the energy @xcite and the shannon and fisher informations @xcite .",
    "let us consider an electron moving in a coulombic potential due to a nucleus with charge @xmath2 , in the presence of parallel magnetic and electric fields oriented in the @xmath3 direction .",
    "the effective potential in spherical coordinates is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the constant magnetic and electric fields strengths , @xmath7 the mass of the electron , @xmath8 the electric constant , and @xmath9 the @xmath3-component of the angular momentum .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation for this potential is @xmath10 note that we have neglected the relativistic corrections @xcite and the spin - orbit coupling @xcite and assumed that the nuclear mass is infinity @xcite , because they do not affect the main results of this work . here",
    ", we shall study the scaling properties of the eigensolutions of this equation of motion under the transformation @xmath11 , where the scaling factor is specified later on .",

    "moreover , the parameter @xmath18 and @xmath19 are also dimensionless , and the energy @xmath20 rescales into @xmath21 as @xmath22 consequently the wavefunction @xmath23 will change as @xmath24 because of the normalization to unity , and the associated probability density @xmath25 as @xmath26    to obtain the scaling of the wavefunction in momentum space , @xmath27 , under the transformation @xmath28 , with @xmath14 given by ( [ lambda ] ) , we take into account that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are mutually fourier - transformed as @xmath31 it is straightforward that the momentum wavefunction scales as @xmath32 and the associated density @xmath33 as @xmath34",
