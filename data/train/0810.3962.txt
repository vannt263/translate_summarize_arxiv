    "the highest mass stars spend their main - sequence lifetimes as o - type dwarfs , giants , and supergiants , and as early b - type giants and supergiants . in order to determine their physical properties ( effective temperatures , bolometric luminosities , stellar radii , surface gravities , etc . )",
    "we must rely upon modeling their spectra , as these stars are so hot that their optical and uv colors have only slight dependence on their physical properties , even effective temperature ( see massey 1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "the stellar atmospheres of such stars are physically complex , and producing realistic synthetic spectra requires the inclusion of nlte , as well as careful treatment of the hydrodynamics of the stellar wind .",
    "the recent inclusion of line blanketing in these models has led to a significant lowering of the effective temperature scale for galactic o - type stars ( martins et al .",

    "such a change has a strong effect on the expected amount of ionizing radiation for stars of a given spectral type ; it also has ( as yet largely unconsidered ) implications for the previous determinations of the ages of young galactic clusters and ob associations , and stellar evolutionary theory , as the theoretical zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) may now be too hot for the locations of stars in the h - r diagram .    in two previous papers ( massey et al .",

    "were many o stars of the earliest type ( o2-o4 ) .",
    "our expectations were that since the metallicity is lower in the smc and lmc ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; russell & dopita 1990 and discussion in paper i ) than in the milky way , the effects of stellar wind - blanketing and line - blanketing would be less , with the result that the effective temperatures of o stars would be hotter in the clouds than in their galactic counterparts .",
    "indeed , this was what we found : smc stars of spectral type o3 - 7  v were found to be 4000 k hotter than galactic stars of the same spectral type , with stars of slightly later type showing increasingly smaller effects until b0  v , at which type there was no discernible effect .",
    "the supergiants show a similar effect .",

    "the spectra used in this study were obtained by pm , nim , and kde on ut 2004 november 27 - 29 using the boller and chivens spectrograph on the clay 6.5-m ( magellan ii ) telescope on las campanas .",

    "each observation was obtained at the parallactic angle , as the instrument was used without an atmospheric dispersion corrector .",
    "the ccd data were reduced using iraf .",
    "the images were trimmed and a bias level subtracted using the overscan .",
    "nine bias exposures ( zero - second exposures ) were averaged , and were used to remove any residual two - dimension structure , although none was evident in our examination of the images .",
    "nine flat - field exposures were obtained each night using the projector flat , with a count level below saturation but whose total number of counts was such that the snr of our program data was not degraded .",
    "twilight sky exposures were used to correct for the slight difference in the illumination function along the slit between the program data and the dome flats .",
    "a series of long and short flat field exposures were used to construct a bad pixel map for the ccd , and the data linearly interpolated over bad columns , etc .",
    "next , the stellar spectra were extracted ( following massey et al .",
    "1992 ) using variance weighting across the spatial direction .",
    "clean \" function was used in order to recognize and remove cosmic rays at this point .",
    "a series of long comparison ( henear ) arc exposures obtained at the beginning of the night was used for the wavelength correction ; tests showed that there was very little flexure within the instrument throughout the night as the instrument rotated about the optical axis at the nasmyth focus .    getting the rectification ( normalization ) ",
    "right \" is important for o stars , particularly for weak lines and for the wings of the balmer lines .",
    "each individual spectrum was normalized before combining , with the blue data first clipped below 3800   to remove the effect of the balmer jump on the normalization .",
    "the normalization was done interactively using a seventh order cubic spline , with care taken to examine the regions around the principle classification / modeling lines .",
    "the three normalized spectra obtained in each wavelength region for each star were then averaged using an algorithm that rejected deviant pixels .",
    "we began by first classifying the stars as to spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "the spectral types were determined qualitatively by comparing the spectra with standards from walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) .",
    "a quantitative determination of the types was also obtained by measuring the ews ( by direct integration ) of he i @xmath10 and he ii @xmath11 , and calculating @xmath12 .",
    "this @xmath13 value was compared against the calibration of conti ( 1988 ) .    as we discussed in paper i",
    ", we expect our ability to detect and measure faint lines to be limited by our spectral resolution @xmath14 and the snr : @xmath15 . for @xmath162.4   , and a snr of 600 ,",
    "we expect the uncertainty to be about 4  m .",
    "thus , we should be able to detect lines at the 3@xmath17 level of 12  m . in practice ,",
    "our measurement of the ews ( which we use only as a secondly check on the spectral classification ) is limited more by the exact rectification , and is typically 20  m , although in some cases is better than this .    for milky way stars ,",
    "the luminosity class is determined primarily by the ",
    "f \" characteristics in the spectra : a luminosity class  v \" star ( dwarf ) will have niii @xmath18 in weak emission , but he ii @xmath19 in strong absorption , designated by the spectroscopic notation  ( ( f ) ) \" .",
    "a luminosity class  iii \" star ( giant ) will have the niii lines in somewhat stronger emission and the he ii @xmath19 line partially filled in by emission , denoted by the spectroscopic notation ",
    "( f ) \" . a luminosity class ",
    "i \" star ( supergiant ) will have both the niii @xmath18 lines and he ii @xmath19 line in strong emission , denoted by the spectroscopic notation  f \" .",
    "thus these classes would be designated somewhat redundantly as ",
    "v((f ) ) \" ,  iii(f ) \" , and  if \" .",
    "the situation is a little more complicated than that for the later o stars , as the  ( ( f ) ) \" characteristic does nt manifest itself until luminosity class iii , and by o9 none of these are found in emission and instead one uses the relative strengths of si iv @xmath20 to he i @xmath21 assign luminosity classes .",
    "the difficulty with extending this to lower metallicity is the following . as first noted mihalas et al .",
    "( 1972 ) , the niii @xmath18 lines go into emission as a result of dielectric recombination , while the he ii @xmath19 emission is formed in the stellar wind .",
    "thus , at lower metallicity we might expect that the niii @xmath18 emission formation will take place at about the same physical conditions , but that the he ii @xmath19 emission will not  at a given effective temperature a higher luminosity will be needed for the same stellar wind strength and he ii @xmath19 emission .",
    "thus , in the smc , it is _ expected _ on simple theoretical grounds to have ",
    "i(f ) \" supergiants while in the milky way stars with the same basic properties ( effective temperatures , surface gravity , and luminosity ) would result in a spectral appearance of  if \" .",
    "this was certainly what we found in papers i and ii .",
    "additionally , subtle luminosity / spectral type criteria , such as the presence of si iv @xmath22 ( denoted by some by the notation  f+ \" ) go into emission due to selective emission mechanisms , and their behavior may also differ with spectral type from what we are used to from milky way examples . therefore in assigning luminosity classes",
    ", we first classified the star as if it were a galactic star , but then paid attention to any large difference between the absolute visual magnitude we derived , and the absolute visual magnitude we expected for the spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "of course , if the visual luminosity was greater than what we expect , this could also be an indication of binarity , and we carefully examined our spectra for tell - tale signs , such as the inability to obtain good fits of both the he i and he ii lines with a single set of parameters . the classification of each star is given in table  [ tab : sample ] , and will be discussed individually below in   [ sec - types ] .",
    "when all is said and done we expect our spectral types are good to one classification step ; i.e. , an o8  v star could be reasonably classified as o7.5  v or o8.5  v.      in order to model the spectra of the stars with fastwind , we need two additional constraints .",
    "the first of these is the absolute visual magnitude @xmath23 , which is needed to calculate the stellar radius for a given set of inputs , and is found from existing photometry and a knowledge of the intrinsic colors , which in turn comes from the spectral type .",
    "the second of these is the terminal velocity of the wind @xmath24 , which we can best measure using the resonance lines in the ultraviolet part of the spectra .    in order to derive an accurate @xmath23 , we began by adopting the intrinsic colors corresponding to the spectral types , using table 3 of massey ( 1998b ) .",
    "we then calculated @xmath23 from @xmath25 where the distance modulus dm is assumed to be 18.9 for the smc and 18.5 for the lmc , following van den bergh ( 2000 ) .",
    "this value was compared to that expected for the assigned luminosity class ( conti et al .",
    "if there was a significant discrepancy , we reassigned a more appropriate luminosity class as discussed above .",
    "we then recalculated the final @xmath23 using the more appropriate intrinsic color .",
    "( in practice , this made very little difference , as the differences in intrinsic colors of o - type stars change by 0.03  mag in @xmath26 as a function of luminosity class . )",
    "the adopted @xmath27 and @xmath23 values are included in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we also include the @xmath27 determined from the @xmath28 colors as a reality check on the @xmath27 values determined from @xmath29 .",
    "in general the agreement is good , with an average difference @xmath30 , and a scatter of 0.13 .",
    "we adopt the @xmath27 determined from @xmath29 as the @xmath26 values are generally more accurately determined than @xmath28 .",
    "the slight systematic offset may also represent how poorly we still know the intrinsic colors of o stars at differing metallicities ( see , for example , the nice work by martins & plez 2006 ) .",
    "the other ingredient for modeling the optical spectra is knowledge of the terminal velocity ( @xmath24 ) of the wind .",
    "many of our stars had well measured values in the literature , while for others we measured these ourselves using the methods described in paper i. for one of the stars , lmc054383 , we obtained new uv data .",
    "we list the measured values , and sources , in table  [ tab : vinf ] .",
    "two stars require additional comments . at the time we planned our magellan observations , we thought ngc 346 - 682 had a stis spectrum , but heap et al .",
    "( 2006 ) note that the acquisition had failed .",
    "a second star , ngc 346 - 487 , has only a lower limit on the terminal velocity .",
    "we have decided to retain both of these stars in our analysis anyway , and , following kudritzki & puls ( 2000 ) , we adopt a value of @xmath31 , where the _ effective _ escape velocity @xmath32 is calculated from the stellar radius @xmath33 and surface gravity @xmath34 , explictly including the eddington factor @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 @xmath37^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the number of free electrons per he atom ( 2 for @xmath39 , 1 otherwise for ob stars ) and @xmath40 is the number ratio of he to h. the surface gravity @xmath34 is in cgs units ( i.e. , for the sun @xmath41 ) .",
    "we expect that the factor of proportionality 2.6 will be fairly insensitive to the metallicity , but one needs to keep in mind that this number is good only to 20% , and that this scaling relationship is approximate in any event ( kudritzki & puls 2000 ) , so we have used rounded values for these two stars .",
    "given the spectral types , neither of these stars is expected to have strong winds . for comparison we include the values of @xmath42 , drawing on the results of the model fitting presented below , for the other stars , where we see that in general there was very good agreement .",
    "the spectra were fit by varying the trial surface gravity , effective temperatures and mass loss rates in the models , and comparing the synthetic spectra to the observed spectrum .",
    "the @xmath43 parameter ( related to the acceleration of the stellar wind ) and the he to h ratio were altered , if needed .",
    "values for the metallicity @xmath44 of 0.2 ( smc ) and 0.5 ( lmc ) were adopted as mentioned earlier , as we did in papers i and ii . we have scaled the solar abundance of asplund ( 2003 ) by these factors , rather than the ( older ) solar abundances used in paper i and ii , although the differences are in fact imperceptible .",
    "as we note in paper i , the actual relative abundances of the interstellar medium in the smc , lmc , _ and _ the nearby regions of the milky way are non - solar , as discussed by westerlund ( 1997 ) , so this is not really the right thing to do , but lacking detailed abundance analysis of these stars ( which is beyond the scope of this paper ) , this is the best we can do for now .    in general , certain lines were primarily affected by varying a single stellar parameter .",
    "for instance , the strengths of the model he i and he ii lines were sensitive primarily to a change in @xmath45 .",
    "the stars in our sample covered the range of effective temperatures from 29,250 to 53,000 k. at the lowest values for @xmath45 the strengths of the si iii and si iv lines were also useful . in paper",
    "i and ii we argue that the uncertainty in our effective temperatures was 1000 k , but in many cases our temperatures are more precisely determined , as the models are sensitive to temperature differences of 250 - 500 k.    the effective surface gravity @xmath46 ( surface gravity reduced by the effects of centrifugal acceleration due to the rotation of the star ) was fit by comparing the wings of h@xmath47 lines to those of the models , with wider lines ( more pressure - broadened ) indicative of a larger value .",
    "values for @xmath48 in our sample ranged from 2.9 for the most extreme supergiant to 4.2 for the most compact dwarf .",
    "we could detect differences in the line profile of h@xmath47 by varying @xmath49 by 0.1 dex .",
    "the determination of the mass loss rates ( @xmath50 ) depended very strongly on the line profile of h@xmath8 and to a lesser extent , h@xmath43 and he ii @xmath19 .",
    "the mass loss rates measured ranged from @xmath51 to @xmath52 yr @xmath6 .",
    "models with lower mass loss rates were generally sensitive to adjustments of 0.1 - 0.2 @xmath53 yr @xmath6 , while the stars with the largest mass loss rates were sensitive to adjustments of about 1 @xmath54 m@xmath55 yr @xmath6 .",
    "the h@xmath8 profile becomes insensitive to mass - loss rates below about @xmath56 yr@xmath6 , and the details of the numerical approach can dominate the results .",
    "models with the highest mass loss rates had both @xmath57 and he ii @xmath04686 in emission . typically , lines in emission allowed a determination of @xmath43 , the wind acceleration parameter , which otherwise was set at default to 0.8 .",
    "we note that in accordance with papers i and ii , the mass - loss rate we determine is with the assumption of homogeneous stellar winds ; the actual mass loss will be related to this by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the clumping factor .",
    "this factor is likely to be of order 6 - 10 or less , if the clumping properties of o stars in the clouds are similar to those in the milky way ( see , for example , the recent conference workshop by hamann et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we assumed a standard he to h ratio of 0.1 , and this sufficed for most of our fitting . in a few cases we found we had to increase this value in order to obtain sufficiently strong he lines .",
    "we discuss these individual cases below .",
    "in comparing the star s line profiles to that of the models , we of course had to correct for the radial velocity of the star , and to broaden the model s lines to match the rotational velocity of the star .",
    "we used the width of several he ii lines as a gauge of the rotational velocity . strictly speaking , much of this broadening was due to the instrumental resolution , which created a floor in our measurements of 140 km s@xmath6 .",
    "occasionally we had to adjust either the radial velocity or @xmath60 values from our preliminary measurements to obtain better agreement .    in table",
    "[ tab : results ] we list the final adopted models for each star .",
    "we include several derived parameters .",
    "the _ true _ surface gravity is the _ effective _ surface gravity corrected for the effects of centrifugal acceleration due to the rotation of the star .",
    "this correction can be approximated ( in a statistical sense , assuming randomly distributed rotational axis orientations ) as simply the square of the projected rotational velocity divided by the stellar radius @xmath33 : @xmath61 following repolust et al .",
    "as discussed above , we expect that low ",
    "rotational velocities \" are actually dominated by the instrumental resolution , but these have a negligible effect .",
    "even the highest rotational velocities in our sample ( 240 km s@xmath6 ) contribute only 0.05  dex to @xmath62 , as seen for bi  208 in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "we also include an estimate of the spectroscopically derived mass of the star , based upon our determination of @xmath62 and the stellar radius ( since @xmath63 , where the mass and radius are in solar units ) ; we will compare these  spectroscopic \" masses to those derived from evolutionary tracks using the star s effective temperature and luminosity in the next section .",
    "we expect some significant number of stars in our sample of 26 stars to have no satisfactory fits , as some fraction will be actually be composites of two ( or more ! ) stars .",
    "at least 7 out of the 40 stars analyzed in papers i and ii admitted no good solution . in this way",
    "our method has some significant advantages over that of the  automatic fitting method \" of mokiem et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 , 2007 ) which obtains a  best answer \" for every star ( see discussion following de koter 2008 ) , but does not reject cases where the model is an unlikely match to the data ( see discussion in press et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "several of our stars have been previously analyzed , and we included these in our program as such overlap provides a crucial test of the methods ( and data ) of ourselves and others .",

    "how do our results compare to others ?",
    "in paper ii we considered our effective temperature scale ( effective temperature as a function of spectral type ) in comparison with those determined by others , finding that our fastwind - derived smc scale was warmer by several thousand degrees than the effective temperatures determined for several ngc 346 stars by bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using tlusty and cmfgen . however , very few stars were in common between various studies at the time , making it difficult to compare the results directly .",

    "[ tab : compa ] we compare the model results for the stars analyzed in this study with those by others , and in table  [ tab : compb ] extend this to other stars in common in papers i and ii with others .",
    "several trends emerge from this comparison .",
    "first , we find that the automatic fitting procedure with fastwind used by mokiem et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) produced effective temperatures that were 1100 k warmer ( on average ) 69 , where mokiem et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find an effective temperature that is 2700 k higher as well as a higher surface gravity . ]",
    "_ for the 11 stars in common for which we found an acceptable fit_. we attribute this differences to the different weights given to fitting various lines : we relied heavily upon he i @xmath68 and ( in the non - supergiants ) he i @xmath10 in determining our best fits .    more significant perhaps is the fact that the automatic fitting procedure of mokiem et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) always finds _ some _ fit which is  best \" , resulting in their deriving physical properties of stars which we find to be clearly composite .",
    "for example , in paper i azv 372 was found to have he  i lines significantly broader than the he  ii lines as well as a radial velocity shift between the he i and he ii lines .",
    "we expect from studies of galactic o stars that at least 36% are spectroscopic binaries",
    "( garmany et al .  1980 ) , with the true percentage of composites",
    "probably higher .",
    "thus , it would be remarkable in an analysis of a large sample of o - type stars to always come up with an acceptable fit ( see discussion following de koter 2008 ) . the lmc sample ( mokiem et al .",
    "2007 ) were  pre - filtered \" to avoid stars that showed radial velocity variations in their data , but no such selection was made for their smc sample , and in neither case were the goodness of the fits used other than to assign uncertainties to the physical properties .",
    "( we are indebted to chris evans for clarifying this situation for us . ) in any event , this problem could be avoided in future work by providing some objective  goodness of fit \" criteria that distinguishes cases where the  best \" fit is not good , as per the general discussion in press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "there are fewer stars ( 7 with good fits ) in common with our studies and the tlusty analysis of bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and heap et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but here we find a much larger range of differences ( from @xmath145 k to + 3500 k ) , with a median difference of 1000 k. thus the differences we saw in paper ii between our temperature calibration and the results for their stars were not due to a systematic effect between the different modeling techniques , but rather due to issues with particular stars .",
    "for example , as we noted above , heap et al .",
    "( 2006 ) retain the star ngc 346 - 368 in their determination of their effective temperature scale , even though they ( and we ) conclude it is a binary . in some cases the adopted spectral types do not match",

    "( 2000 ) , while we find a type of o6  v here .",
    "this type mismatch could be in part caused by the lack of nebular subtraction in the walborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) data , and in other cases could be the result of improper sky subtraction . as noted in paper ii , the aat echelle spectra used by walborn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for spectral classification were incorrectly corrected for moonlight contamination : they describe a procedure which removed the solar line absorption spectrum , but which would have left the moonlight continuum contribution contaminating the spectrum .",
    "chris evans ( private communication , 2005 ) reports that he was subsequently able to correct the spectra for most stars used in the analysis by bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and heap et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but that there were insufficient sky pixels for sky subtraction for ngc 346 - 368 and ngc 346 - 487 .",
    "yet these stars were included in their analysis .",
    "how large a difference did this make in practice ?",
    "we give a comparison for ngc346 - 487 in fig .",
    "[ fig : heap ] . the aat lines are weaker , as would be expected from uncorrected night sky contamination .",
    "the differences in ews are significant : in the aat data we measure 240 m  for he ii @xmath91 , 270 m   for he i @xmath68 , and and 300 m   for he",
    "ii @xmath11 , while in our own data we measure 530 m , 350 m , and 615 m , respectively : factors of 2.2 , 1.3 , and 2.1 higher .",
    "thus , modeling involving these lines would invariably lead to discordant results compared to ours .",
    "clearly he i @xmath10 would not provide much constraints in the aat data .",
    "recall that bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) were unable to obtain a good fit to the optical spectrum of this star , and had to rely primarily on their uv data .",
    "we derive very different results for this star , with our measurement 3000 k hotter and a @xmath49 that is 0.2  dex higher , as shown in table  [ tab : compa ] .    what about the other stars ?",
    "the other star with no sky subtraction in their data , ngc 346 - 368 , we find to be a binary . for ngc 346 - 324 ,",
    "our results are in very good agreement , with our temperature 500 k hotter . for that star",
    "we measure ews of 200 m  and 760 m  for he i @xmath10 and",
    "he ii @xmath11 , respectively , compared to 250 m  and 760 m  in our own data , in reasonable agreement .",
    "the difference is in the opposite sense than expected , though , in that our slightly stronger line should lead to a slightly cooler temperature , everything else being equal . for ngc",
    "346 - 355 we are unable to measure he i in their spectra ; we detect this line at the 50 m  level thanks to our much higher snrs . for he",
    "ii @xmath11 we measure an ew of 685 m  in their data , while in ours we measure 720 m , again in substantial agreement .",
    "the large difference in the derived effective temperature ( our 49500 k value vs their 52500 value ) is presumably due to the fact that we were able to detect he i , which constrained the effective temperature .",
    "bouret et al .",
    "( 2003 ) did also model uv data , which provided additional constraints ; we plan such an extension to our work in the future , as discussed further below .",
    "in paper ii we presented a revised effective temperature scale for o - type stars , based upon our analysis with fastwind of a sample of o stars in the smc and lmc , as well as the study by repolust et al .",
    "( 2004 ) of galactic stars .",
    "we presented in tabular form our revised scale for the smc supergiants , smc giants and dwarfs ( which appeared to be indistinguishable ) , galactic supergiants , and galactic giants and dwarfs .",
    "unsurprisingly we found a substantial difference between the smc and galactic effective temperature calibrations , with the smc scale significantly hotter ( 3000 - 4000 k ) for the early o s , with negligible differences by b0 .",
    "this is in accord with the expected effects of wind- and line - blanketing , which will be less significant at lower metallicities .",
    "the data were too scant to determine a scale for the lmc stars , although our data showed that the temperatures for lmc stars were intermediate between those for smc and milky way stars , as would be expected from their metallicity .    with the large sample of stars",
    ", we revisit this issue here . in fig",
    "[ fig : teff ] ( upper ) we show now all of the smc data from papers i , ii , and the present work , along with the smc effective temperature calibration .",
    "filled symbols show data from the present paper in order to demonstrate how the current study has improved our coverage of spectral types .",
    "dwarfs are indicated by circles , giants by squares , and supergiants by triangles .",
    "the proposed dwarf and giant effective temperature scale is shown by a solid line , and that of the supergiants by a dashed line .",
    "we see that the new data are in reasonable accord with the adopted relationship . if anything the dwarf and giant sequence may be a little hotter than it should be for the earlier types .",
    "note that even with the new data there are no constraints on the supergiant sequence for stars earlier than o5 i.    what of the lmc stars ?",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : teff ] ( lower ) we now add these stars to the mix using red to distinguish them from the smc stars , but otherwise retaining the same symbols . for simplicity we have excluded the o2 - 3.5 stars of uncertain types from papers i and ii . we see that there is little to no difference between lmc and smc stars by the late o / early b types ( even , surprisingly , for supergiants ) , but that for earlier types the lmc stars _ are _ cooler than their lmc counterparts .",
    "again , this is what is expected .",
    "we also see with the new data that giants may indeed be intermediate in effective temperature between dwarfs and supergiants , at least for the earlier types .    what is needed to further refine these relationships ? for the lmc stars we need analysis of more mid- and late - type o dwarfs , and mid - type supergiants . for the smc ,",
    "analysis of early - type supergiants would be useful .",
    "for now , we retain the effective temperature scale laid out in table 9 of paper ii .",
    "groenewegen et al .  (",
    "1989 ) were the first to describe the ",
    "mass discrepancy \" , which was subsequently studied extensively by herrero et al .  ( 1992 ) .",
    "the  spectroscopic mass \" follows directly from the results of modeling the spectra , with @xmath146 , where the mass and the radius are expressed in solar units ) .",
    "however , the effective temperature and luminosity from the modeling also imply a mass , which we call the  evolutionary mass \" ( @xmath147 ) from the evolutionary tracks .",
    "the mass discrepancy refers to the systematic difference between these two .",
    "early studies found that the spectroscopic mass was systematically less than the evolutionary mass , by as much as a factor of two for supergiants .",
    "improvements in the stellar atmosphere models have decreased or eliminated the size of the discrepancy for galactic stars ( herrero 2003 ; repolust et al .",
    "2004 ; mokiem et al .",
    "as we discuss in paper ii , the expected reason is two - fold : the new atmosphere models include line blanketing and thus result in lower effective temperatures , decreasing the inferred luminosities , and hence the deduced evolutionary mass will be less .",
    "in addition , the new models result in larger photospheric radiation pressure , so a higher surface gravity is needed to reproduce the stark - broadened wings of the balmer lines .",
    "( to some extent , however , this is offset by the fact that the cooler temperatures require a lower surface gravity to fit the balmer lines ; see repolust et al .",
    "however , in paper ii we found that there was still a mass discrepancy for the hottest o stars in the magellanic clouds . here",
    "we revisit the issue .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mass ] we plot the evolutionary mass vs the spectroscopic mass .",
    "although many points cluster along the 1:1 line , there are still a substantial number of points significantly above the line .",
    "the error bars are based on the same assumptions as in paper ii .",
    "it is clear that the mass discrepancy is still very much with us , at least in the magellanic clouds .",
    "we have used the same symbols as before : circles are dwarfs , squares are giants , and triangles are supergiants .",
    "filled symbols denote the new results here , while open symbols come from papers i and ii .",
    "( we have included stars of uncertain spectral types but exclude any stars for which we derived only a lower limit to their effective temperatures . ) in paper ii we suggested that the stars with a significant mass discrepancy were those with the highest effective temperatures , @xmath148 45,000  k. here we denote such stars in red .",
    "it is clear from the figure that this distinction is not really correct . in part",
    "this is clarified by the addition of the new data here .",
    "there are stars of relatively lower mass with cooler temperatures which clearly show such an effect .",
    "furthermore , such stars are not invariably supergiants , as was originally suggested for the galactic example by herrero et al .",
    "we have searched for correlations between the size of the mass discrepancy with effective temperature and/or surface gravity , and find little connection . as we suggest in paper ii",
    ", it may be that in a few cases the answer is that a star has been affected by binary evolution ; i.e. , lh64 - 16 , the giant shown at the top of the lmc plot . while the overall agreement in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] is encouraging , the figure shows that some improvement is still needed in either the atmosphere or evolutionary models , or both .",
    "we note that we have used the older , non - rotating evolutionary models of charbonnel et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and schaerer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in determining the evolutionary masses , but the use of the newer , rotating models , such as meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) , ( for which we do not have isochrones readily available ) would exacerbate the differences rather than reduce them , as argued in paper ii .",
    "we have analyzed the spectra of 26 o and early b stars in the magellanic clouds , obtaining satisfactory fits to 18 stars .",
    "the effective temperatures we derive are in accord with the effective temperature scale we presented in paper ii .",
    "we emphasize that the  of \" indicators ( n iii @xmath149 and he ii @xmath19 emission ) do not track the luminosity of the star in precisely the same manner as at galactic metallicities , as the causes of the emission are different . with our very high snr data , we are able to detect the weak he i @xmath10 line in some of the earliest spectral types , providing strong constraints on the effective temperatures and other physical properties of these stars . we do find some significant differences with the work of others : the automatic fastwind fitting procedure of mokiem et al .",

    "the problem does not seem to be correlated with a single parameter ( such as effective temperature ) , but is present for some stars and not for others .",
    "in paper ii we argue that the results from the literature suggest that there may be differences dependent upon what wavelength region is analyzed , and even possibly what programs are used .",
    "the trouble with such comparisons in the past is that they have been based on samples with little or no overlap of individual stars .",

    "<S> in order to better determine the physical properties of hot , massive stars as a function of metallicity , we obtained very high snr optical spectra of 26 o and early b stars in the magellanic clouds . </S>",
    "<S> these allow accurate modeling even in cases where the he i @xmath04471 line has an equivalent width of only a few tens of m . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra were modeled with fastwind , with good fits obtained for 18 stars ; the remainder show signatures of being binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we include stars in common to recent studies to investigate possible systematic differences . </S>",
    "<S> the  automatic \" fastwind modeling method of mokiem and collaborators produced temperatures 1100  k hotter on the average , presumably due to the different emphasis given to various temperature - sensitive lines . </S>",
    "<S> more significant , however , is that the automatic method always produced some  best \" answer , even for stars we identify as composite ( binaries ) . </S>",
    "<S> the temperatures found by the tlusty / cmfgen modeling of bouret , heap , and collaborators yielded temperatures 1000 k cooler than ours , on average . </S>",
    "<S> significant outliers were due either to real differences in the data ( some of the bouret / heap data were contaminated by moonlight continua ) or the fact we could detect the he  i line needed to better constrain the temperature . our new data agrees well with the effective temperature scale we presented previously . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the  of \" emission - line do not track luminosity classes in the exact same manner as in milky way stars . </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the the issue of the  mass discrepancy \" , finding that some of the stars in our sample do have spectroscopic masses that are significantly smaller than those derived from stellar evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find that the size of the mass discrepancy is simply related to either effective temperature or surface gravity . </S>"
