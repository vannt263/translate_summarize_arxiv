    "john bell @xcite has shown that local realistic models are impossible for quantum mechanics of two qubits .",
    "after some years researchers started to ask questions about the bell theorem for more complicated systems ( compare the classic review in which such problems are not covered , @xcite ) .",
    "first results concerning possible extensions to entangled states of pairs of @xmath0-state systems , with @xmath1 , arrived in early eighties @xcite .",
    "the early research was confined to stern - gerlach type measurements ( which are parametrized by only two numbers , defining the direction of the measurement axis ) .",
    "some authors speculated that correspondence principle suggests that non - classicality should diminish with growing @xmath0 .",
    "however , on one hand in the meantime we witnessed a surprise in the form of the ghz theorem @xcite : for three or more qubits the conflict between local realism and quantum mechanics is much sharper than for two .",
    "thus , with the increase of the dimensionality of the full system , non - classicality of quantum correlations can grow . on the other hand , peres and",
    "gisin @xcite considered dichotomic observables applied to maximally entangled pairs of qu@xmath0its , and showed that violations of the chsh inequalities robustly survive in the limit of @xmath2 .",
    "the concept of multiport interferometers , first discussed in the context of quantum entanglement by klyshko @xcite , gave a hope for operational realizations of unitary transformations much richer than those linking measurement stern - gerlach bases for higher spins .",
    "proposals of bell experiments with the multiports were presented in @xcite .",
    "multiport interferometers were shown to be capable to reproduce all finite dimensional unitary transformations @xcite , i.e. , one can have access to the full u(@xmath0 ) group .",
    "this lead to the discovery that two maximally entangled qu@xmath0its violate local realism more strongly than qubits , and that this violation grows with @xmath0 , see @xcite .",
    "the strength of the non - classicality was measured via a `` white '' noise resistance .",
    "one takes a family of mixed states @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the state under consideration , and @xmath5 is the maximally mixed state .",
    "the lower is the threshold value @xmath6 beyond which state does not violate local realism in a given bell experiment , the bigger is the noise admixture @xmath7 , which is needed to erase the non - classicality of the state in the experiment .",
    "note that @xmath8 is a natural generalization of the `` factor of violation '' of a bell inequality .",
    "e.g. for the chsh inequality , if @xmath9 is the bell operator , its local realistic bound can be violated maximally by a factor of @xmath10 .",
    "the same can be said about cglmp inequalities @xcite .",
    "the results were obtained via a numerical analysis , which is a prototype of the one which will be presented .",
    "the values were confirmed by collins et al .",
    "@xcite who derived a set of tight correlation bell ( cglmp ) inequalities specific for qu@xmath0it measurements .",
    "this tool helped to discover a strange property of two qu@xmath0it states .",
    "maximally entangled states do not violate the cglmp inequalities for qutrits maximally .",
    "the schmidt decompositions of the optimal states does have all amplitudes of the same modulus  one of them is smaller @xcite .",
    "the results were generalized further by chen at al . @xcite . with a new version of a qu@xmath0it bell inequality , the optimality of non",
    "- maximally entangled states was shown in arbitrary dimension , @xcite .",
    "note however , that in the papers a specific set of local observables was used , defined by a set of local phase shifts ( in the schmidt decomposition basis for the state ) , followed by an `` unbiased '' multiport beamsplitters ( class m1 in fig .",
    "1 ) , and finally detectors . thus ,",
    "non - classicality was not fully mapped .",
    "here we report an exhaustive numerical analysis of the two - qutrit bell experiment involving two settings per observer .",
    "the observables are absolutely general , all possible ones are studied ( that is the unitary transformations defining the measurement bases are forming the u(3 ) group ) .",
    "such an analysis allows us to map the strength of violations of local realism ( as measured by noise resistance ) for all possible pure two - qutrit states . in this way",
    "we discover that schmidt rank-2 states give rise to highest violations .",
    "this phenomenon continues if we increase the number of settings for the observers to three and four .",
    "the investigations were also extended to higher dimensional systems , for which we tested a few specially chosen states .",
    "the phenomenon seems to persist , and is even more pronounced . as a by - product of our investigations",
    "we have found for two qutrits a relatively simple set of unitary transformations ( defined by just three phases ) , which gives a map of violations of local realism which diverges from the one for the full u(3 ) group defined measurements by maximally just 1.5% , and for a broad class of states leads to the same level of non - classicality .",
    "we have also studied some interesting mixed states , which contain bound entanglement .",
    "let us move on to the quantum processes that we analyze , and the numerical approach .",
    "we begin with the two - qutrit case . in our numerical analysis ( called steam - roller )",
    "we consider a class of pure states of two qutrits , which contains all possible schmidt decompositions : @xmath11 two spatially separated observers perform measurements of @xmath12 alternative local noncommuting trichotomic observables : @xmath13 for alice and @xmath14 for bob .",
    "we assume that they measure observables defined by a set of phase - shifters and ( see fig .",
    "[ ufig - jg ] ) :            a @xmath0 input and output unbiased multiport performs a unitary transformation described by the fourier matrix @xmath15 where @xmath16 the unitary transformations m1 and m2 , obviously can not reproduce the full u(3 ) group . we have checked that this is also the case for m3 transformations .    by saying that an experiment is local realistic we understand that it has a local realistic model for the assumed set of settings . in order to obtain the value of the critical visibility @xmath8 to allow such models for any observables from a given class ,",
    "we follow the procedure of the kind first used in refs .",
    "@xcite ( but with a much more advanced implementation and structure ) .",
    "the method is described in the appendix .",
    "the critical visibility is calculated with the use of the simplex algorithm @xcite from the glpk library @xcite .",
    "this critical visibility is dependent on the angles ( parameters of the observables ) and it can be shown that it is in fact a continuous but non - differentiable function , of the angles @xcite",
    ". an intuitive explanation of why this is the case will be given in the last paragraph . the critical visibility function can be minimized with the use of non - linear optimization algorithms .",
    "since it is non - differentiable we are limited to the ones which do not require the derivative of the optimized function .",
    "we use the established nelder mead method @xcite . despite problems raised in @xcite where it is shown that the method does not converge to a stationary point in the general case ,",
    "in our case it converges nicely when applied to the critical visibility function .",
    "this was tested extensively by comparison with both results derived analytically and known from other sources .",
    "it should be noted , however , that while the search for critical visibility is guaranteed to return the correct result @xcite , the nelder - mead method may return a local minimum .",
    "therefore , one can be sure that the actual minimal critical visibility is not greater than the one given here ( but it might be smaller ) .    for qutrit experiments with two alternative measurement settings per observer ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "realistic models are equivalent to the existence of a joint probability distribution @xmath47 , where @xmath48 denotes the result of the measurement of alice s @xmath49-th observable ( bob s results are denoted by @xmath50 ) .",
    "quantum predictions for the probabilities should be given , if the model exists , by marginal sums @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the probability of obtaining the result @xmath53 by alice and @xmath54 by bob , if they measure the observables @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively and @xmath57 .",
    "if we admix some amount of white noise to the two qutrit state , we obtain the quantum probabilities @xmath58 in the form of @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the quantum - mechanically calculated probability for the state without the noise admixture .    for @xmath61",
    ", it is known that for some entangled states , no local realistic probability distribution @xmath62 which could satisfy the set of equalities ( [ marginals ] ) exists .",
    "therefore , no local realistic model can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics for these entangled states",
    ". however , for such states there always exists the critical visibility @xmath8 such that for @xmath63 there exists a local realistic probability distribution @xmath62 that satisfies the set of equalities ( [ marginals ] ) .",
    "our task  for a given state @xmath64  is to find settings for which the critical visibility is minimal .",
    "the computation of @xmath8 ( for the given parameters ) is equivalent to finding the set of @xmath65 positive numbers ( the values of @xmath47 ) summing up to @xmath66 and fulfilling the @xmath67 conditions given by ( [ marginals ] ) such that @xmath68 is maximal .",
    "therefore , @xmath68 and @xmath47 can be treated as variables lying in a @xmath69-dimensional real space .",
    "the set of linear conditions ( [ marginals ] ) and the conditions @xmath70 define a convex set in this space .",
    "our task is to find a vertex of the set with the largest @xmath68 coordinate .",
    "this is done by means of linear programming @xcite . of course one",
    "can easily formulate generalization of the presented approach to more settings per observer and systems of higher dimensionality .",
    "however in such cases the computing time increases , and thus we studied only specific interesting examples .",
    "the 36 probabilities @xmath71 define a point @xmath72 in a 36-dimensional space , which might be inside , on the boundary or outside the pitovsky - bell polytope in that space @xcite .",
    "the point @xmath72 in this space is within ( i.e. inside or on the boundary of ) the pitovsky - bell polytope if and only if the set of equalities ( [ marginals ] ) is satisfied by the coordinates of @xmath72 .",
    "let us consider a state @xmath73 and a set of observables @xmath74 for which the corresponding point @xmath72 is outside the bell polytope ( for @xmath61 ) .",
    "the position of @xmath72 is dependent on @xmath68 , with @xmath75 well inside the polytope and @xmath76 on a facet of the polytope .",
    "given ( [ probability ] ) we know that @xmath77 is a linear function in the 36-dimensional space .",
    "the critical visibility function for slightly perturbed angles ( parameters of the observables ) can now be calculated by recalculating all @xmath78 probabilities and connecting @xmath75 and the new @xmath79 with a straight line .",
    "@xmath75 will not change its position since for visibility equal to 0 the observables do not matter .",
    "@xmath79 will be slightly perturbed .",
    "thus the new @xmath80 point will also be `` just next to '' the previous critical visibility point and hence  the critical visibility function is continuous .",
    "it is also differentiable as long as we stay on the same facet of the bell polytope .",
    "but if we perturb the angles in a vicinity of an edge of the bell polytope , differentiability is lost .",
    "hence , as mentioned before , the critical visibility is a continuous but non - differentiable function of parameters defining the observables .",

    "there one can find a range of the @xmath17 and @xmath18 parameters of the state ( [ state - jg ] ) , for which the critical visibility is below the lowest known critical visibility ( @xmath19 ) in the case of the cglmp inequality , for the asymmetric state @xmath20 found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig . [ violmap ] ) .",
    "the lowest critical visibility is 0.6821 and surprisingly corresponds to the schmidt rank-2 states @xmath21 : @xmath22 , or @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( outside the map , but trivially related with the previous one ) .",
    "we can observe this phenomenon by using the most general local three - dimensional observables ( u(3 ) ) and transformations m3 , while for less general observables ( e.g. m1 , m2 ) , it is unobservable .",
    "despite the fact that the model noise well describes e.g. dark counts , one may criticize `` white '' noise resistance as a measure of non - classicality , see e.g. @xcite .",

    "if @xmath33 , there does not exist any local realistic model describing quantum probabilities of experimental events.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]       we can also observe such phenomena in the 4-dimensional case .",
    "for the most general local 4-dimensional observables defined by the u(4 ) group , the critical visibility obtained for a symmetric schmidt rank-2 state ( e.g. @xmath34 ) is equal to @xmath35 , whereas the critical visibility necessary for violation the cglmp inequality is equal to @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the asymmetric @xcite and symmetric @xcite states respectively ( see tab .",

    "we establish that these are the lowest possible critical visibilities for two - qutrit states and give a strong numerically supported conjecture that it is so for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "one could claim that a rank-2 state is effectively a two qubit state .",
