    "real world quantum systems interact with their environment to a greater or lesser extent .",
    "no matter how weak the coupling with such an environment , the evolution of an open quantum system is eventually affected by nonunitary features like decoherence , dissipation , and heating .",
    "decoherence , in particular , is a serious obstacle to all applications exploiting quantum coherence , such as the bourgeoning field of quantum information processing .",
    "recently , considerable effort has been devoted to designing strategies able to counteract the undesired effects of the coupling with an external environment .",
    "notable examples of these strategies in the field of quantum information are quantum error correction codes @xcite and error avoiding codes @xcite , both based on encoding the state to be protected into carefully selected subspaces of the joint hilbert space of the system and a number of ancillary systems .",
    "the main difference between the two encoding strategies is that error avoiding codes ( also called decoherence - free subspaces ) provide a passive strategy relying on the occurrence of specific symmetries in the interaction with the environment , which guarantees the existence of state space regions inaccessible to noise .",
    "quantum error correction is instead an active strategy in which the encoding is performed in such a way that the various errors are mapped onto orthogonal subspaces so that they can be diagnosed and reversed .",
    "a simple example of decoherence - free subspace has been recently demonstrated with two trapped ions @xcite , while error correction codes for single qubit errors has been demonstrated only in nmr quantum information processors @xcite .",
    "the main limitation for the efficient implementation of these encoding strategies for combatting decoherence is the large amount of extra space resources required @xcite .",
    "correcting all the possible one - qubit errors requires at least five qubits @xcite and if fault tolerant error correction is also considered , the number of ancillary qubits rapidly increases . for this reason , other alternative approaches which do not require any ancillary resources have been pursued , and which may be divided into two main categories : closed - loop ( quantum feedback ) @xcite , and open - loop @xcite decoherence control strategies . in closed loop techniques ,",
    "the system to be protected is subject to appropriate measurements and the classical information obtained from this measurement is used for real - time correction of the system dynamics .",
    "this technique shares therefore some similarities with quantum error correction , which also checks which error has taken place and eventually corrects it .",
    "however , the main limiting aspect of feedback schemes is the need of a measurement , which is always inevitably subject to the limitations due to non - unit detection efficiency .",
    "in fact , only under specific cases ( see @xcite ) it is possible to automatically correct the error without a measurement , as in quantum error correction codes . in open loop control strategies instead , the system is subject to external , suitably tailored , time - dependent drivings which are independent of the system dynamics and do not require any measurement , but only a limited , _ a priori _ , knowledge of the system - environment dynamics .",
    "these external control hamiltonians are chosen in order to realize an effective dynamical decoupling of the system from the environment . in this way , any undesired effect of the environment , such as dissipation , decoherence , heating , can be eliminated in principle .",
    "the essential physical idea behind these open loop schemes comes from refocusing techniques in nmr spectroscopy , now routinely used to eliminate unwanted interactions @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , these decoupling methods have recently attracted a large interest and they have been applied in many different situations , such as the inhibition of the decay of an unstable atomic state @xcite , or the suppression of magnetic state decoherence @xcite .",
    "the general applicability of decoupling methods has been discussed in @xcite , while the possibility to combine decoupling techniques together with weak - strength and slow - switching controls has been analysed in @xcite , where the conditions under which noise - tolerant , universal quantum control of a system can be performed with no extra space resources , have been determined .",
    "the general algebraic structure behind decoupling strategies has been also analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is shown how decoupling can be also considered as a dynamical _ symmetrization _ with respect to a group .",
    "this more general algebraic framework has also provided a unifying picture for coding and decoupling noise control strategies @xcite .",
    "in fact , when decoupling open loop controls are combined together with encoding into larger hilbert spaces , fault - tolerant universal control of quantum systems becomes possible even with limited control resources .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the heisenberg exchange interaction is sufficient to perform universal quantum computation if appropriately encoded qubits are used @xcite ; these encoded subspaces may actually be made decoherence - free if appropriate decoupling controls are applied in parallel @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of open loop decoupling procedures is that the timing constraints are particularly stringent .",
    "in fact , the decoupling interactions has to be turned on and off at extremely short time scales , even faster than typical environmental timescale ( _ full - strength / fast - switching _ or _ quantum bang - bang _ controls @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , perfect decoupling from the environment is obtained only in the infinitely fast control limit ( see section ii ) and it is therefore important to establish in a quantitative way how effective these decoupling schemes are in a realistic situation with control pulses with finite strength and time duration .",
    "a detailed analysis of decoupling timescales has been performed only in @xcite for the case a single qubit in the presence of a purely dephasing environment , and in @xcite in the case of a linearly damped vibrational degrees of freedom . in this latter case ,",
    "@xcite proved that perfect decoupling can be achieved using extremely fast `` parity kicks '' , and that significant suppression of dissipation and decoherence due to the coupling with a zero - temperature bath is obtained as soon as the frequency of parity kicks becomes larger than the frequency cutoff of the environment . in the present paper we shall reconsider the model of ref .",
    "@xcite and extend the analysis to the case of a _ finite temperature _ environment .",
    "the motivation for this study is twofold .",
    "first of all it will allow us to establish if and how thermal effects influence the decoupling strategy , that is , if temperature introduces a new timescale which , together with the environmental frequency cutoff , determines the effectiveness of the parity kick decoupling strategy .",
    "secondly , the damped harmonic oscillator in a finite temperature bath studied in this paper well describes a collective vibrational mode of a chain of trapped ions , which is used as a quantum bus in linear ion trap quantum computers @xcite .",
    "one of the main experimental problems for quantum information processing with linear ion traps is just heating of these vibrational modes @xcite , and it is therefore extremely important to establish if the parity kick decoupling method of ref .",
    "@xcite is able to suppress heating and decoherence in this case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii decoupling strategies in general , and the parity kick method of ref .",
    "@xcite as a particular example , are presented . in section",
    "iii the dynamics of the vibrational mode in the presence of a nonzero temperature bath and parity kicks is analyzed in detail and in section iv the numerical results for both heating and decoherence rates are presented .",
    "section v is for concluding remarks .",
    "the starting point of decoupling techniques is the observation that even though one does not have access to the large number of uncontrollable degrees of freedom of the environment , it is still possible to interfere with its dynamics by inducing motions into the _ system _ , which are at least as fast as the environment dynamics .",
    "this indirect influence of the environment is obtained through the application of suitable time - dependent perturbations acting on the system variables only .",
    "let us now review the main points of the decoupling technique following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we consider a quantum system @xmath0 coupled to an arbitrary bath @xmath1 , whose overall hamiltonian can be written as @xmath2 a decoupling strategy consists in trying to protect the evolution of @xmath0 against the effect of the interaction @xmath3 , by seeking a perturbation @xmath4 to be added to @xmath5 so that the total hamiltonian becomes @xmath6 .",
    "one usually restricts to situations where the control field is _ cyclic _ , _ i.e. _ , associated to a decoupling operator @xmath7 that is periodic over some cycle time @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes time ordering . in this case one focus on the _ stroboscopic _ evolution at times @xmath11 , and it is possible to see that in this case the evolution is driven by an effective _ average _ hamiltonian @xcite @xmath12 the calculation of the average hamiltonian @xmath13 is performed on the basis of a standard magnus expansion of the time - ordered exponential defining the cycle propagator @xcite , @xmath14\\ ,   t_c/\\hbar } \\ ; ,   \\label{magnus}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 \\otimes   { \\cal b}_\\alpha \\;.",
    "\\label{htilde}\\ ] ] the various contributions in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ magnus ] ) collect terms of equal order in @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 \\;. \\label{first } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one says that @xmath18th - order decoupling is achieved if the control field @xmath19 can be devised so that contributions mixing @xmath0 and @xmath1 degrees of freedom are no longer present in @xmath20 and the first nonvanishing correction arises from @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "one then considers the infinitely fast control limit , which , for a finite evolution time @xmath10 , requires considering @xmath23 in the limit @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in this limit ,",
    "first - order decoupling is sufficient , contributions higher than zeroth - order are negligible in ( [ magnus ] ) , and one can focus on the problem of designing the effective hamiltonian @xmath20 of eq .",
    "( [ zeroth ] ) in such a way that there is no residual system - environment coupling .",
    "the more general way to engineer the average hamiltonian @xmath20 is through _ symmetrization _ with respect to a finite group @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "in fact , if we consider a finite group of unitary operators @xmath27 , symmetrization is the map ( acting on system operator only ) @xmath28 which is also the projection on the so - called _ centralizer _ of @xmath29 , composed of operators commuting with every element @xmath30 of the group @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the map ( [ map ] ) can be dynamically implemented through a simple piecewise constant decoupling operator : @xmath31 corresponding to a partition of the cycle time @xmath8 into @xmath32 intervals of equal length @xmath33 .",
    "then , by ( [ htilde ] ) , @xmath34 showing that the average hamiltonian @xmath20 , generating time evolution in the infinitely fast control limit , has been symmetrized , i.e. , has become invariant with respect to the group @xmath29 . perfect decoupling from the environment is achieved when @xmath35 and in this case the effective open system evolution for the reduced density operator of the system @xmath36 over time @xmath10 is governed by @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the system is no more interacting with the environment and the residual time evolution is driven by a projected system hamiltonian , invariant with respect to @xmath29 .",
    "a number of examples of decoupling groups @xmath29 has now appeared in the literature , expecially for the case of many - qubits dissipative registers with various kinds of interaction with the environment @xcite .",
    "another important example for applications in quantum computing is the case of a linearly dissipative vibrational degree of freedom , which can be used as a _ quantum bus _ in linear ion trap quantum computers @xcite , and which has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be decoupled by the group @xmath39 , composed by the identity and the parity operator @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , it is straightforward to check that the decoupling condition ( [ decoup ] ) is equivalent to the condition of eq .",
    "( 7 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite .    as it can be expected , implementing the above general decoupling strategy is by no means trivial .",
    "first of all , for a given @xmath3 , the identification of a minimal group @xmath29 able to produce decoupling is nontrivial . secondly , the decoupling prescription ( [ decoupling ] ) requires the capability of instantaneously changing the evolution operator from @xmath30 to @xmath41 over successive subintervals .",
    "this means assuming the capability of implementing arbitrarily strong and extremely fast control operations .",
    "such impulsive full - power control configurations correspond to so - called _ quantum bang - bang controls _ as introduced in @xcite . as it has been already shown in @xcite ,",
    "the most stringent condition is not on the strength but rather on the extremely high speed of the control operations : one has to be faster than the typical _ environmental _ timescale , which is usually fixed by the frequency cutoff of the bath spectrum , @xmath42 .",
    "however , the identification of the frequency cutoff @xmath42 as the only relevant parameter determining the threshold for the decoupling cycle frequency @xmath43 above which the decoupling procedure becomes effective , has been done in refs .",
    "@xcite only on the basis of two specific examples . in ref .",

    "the case of nonzero temperature has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite but only in the particular case of a single qubit subject to a purely dephasing , energy - conserving , environment .",
    "it is therefore important to establish the effectiveness of decoupling techniques in the general case of a _ nonzero - temperature , dissipative bath_. from now on we shall specialize to the case of the linearly damped harmonic oscillator of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is of relevance for linear ion trap quantum computation .",
    "in fact , we shall demonstrate that decoupling techniques can be successfully used to efficiently suppress heating of the vibrational center - of - mass motion of the ion chain .",
    "we choose a harmonic oscillator as system of interest @xmath44 describing a collective vibrational mode of a linear chain of trapped ions with frequency @xmath45 .",
    "it has been already experimentally verified @xcite that the nonunitary features of the vibrational dynamics ( heating and decoherence ) are well described by modelling the environment as a collection of independent bosonic modes @xcite @xmath46 interacting with the vibrational mode via the following bilinear interaction hamiltonian in which the `` counter - rotating '' terms are dropped @xmath47 the symmetrization with respect to the group @xmath39 is performed by periodically pulsing the oscillation frequency , that is , by changing the potential so that @xmath45 is changed to @xmath48 for a time interval @xmath49 and with a time period @xmath50 ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "the dynamics of the system in the presence of parity kicks will be exactly solved for both initial conditions of the vibrational mode , by exploiting the fact that a tensor product of coherent states retains its form at all times when the evolution is generated by the hamiltonian of eqs .",

    "@xcite for a proof - of - principle demonstration of quantum bang - bang control in a photon polarization qubit ) .",
    "we have also shown that , differently from heating , the suppression of vibrational decoherence is more difficult , because in a nonzero temperature bath , the threshold for the decoupling cycle frequency is determined not only by the bath frequency cutoff , but also by the decoherence rate , which increases for increasing temperatures .",
    "the parity kick cycle frequency has to be larger than _ both _ rates and this makes suppression of vibrational decoherence more difficult for higher temperatures .",
