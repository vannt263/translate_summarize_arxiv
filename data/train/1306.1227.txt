    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "together , these results may imply parallel evolutionary paths for the growth of smbhs and the stellar mass of their host galaxies .",
    "however , the physical mechanisms that drive this apparent link between sf and bh growth over a wide variety of galaxies are still poorly understood .",
    "active smbh accretion ( i.e. active galactic nucleus , agn ) and galactic star formation ( sf ) both require a supply of gas .",
    "thus , the clues of uncovering the connection between their growth may lie in the gas fueling mechanisms that supply both galactic star formation and agn .",
    "recent studies have observed the existence of two different modes of star formation : the quiescent `` main sequence '' star formation , and starbursts @xcite .",
    "the first mode can be fueled by continuous gas inflow @xcite and the second mode is postulated to be triggered by gas - rich major mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is still not clear whether these processes also drive the growth of smbhs , or whether smbh growth would scale similarly with galactic star formation in different sf modes , since the dynamical scales of the gas inflows that induce galactic star formation and smbh accretion are vastly different ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "a number of studies have investigated the link between sfr and bhar . for high - luminosity agns ,",
    "an increase in the average sfr as a function of bhar has been observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while other studies have also found weak or inverted connections @xcite .",
    "studies with inclusions of lower luminosity agns further suggest that the evolutionary link between smbhs and their host galaxies only exists in high luminosity agns that are possibly triggered by mergers , and there is little or no correlation at lower luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the contrary , the study of the _ average _ bhar of star - forming galaxies implies that the galaxy and smbh growth rates may be strongly connected when averaging over the whole population of star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , whether bh growth follows sf in all galaxies , or only in the most powerful systems , remains a matter of debate .    the apparent contradictory results may be attributed to the difference in the characteristic timescales of sf and bh accretion .",
    "theoretical studies of smbh accretion with feedback imply that the smbh accretion rate can vary by more than five orders of magnitudes on timescale of less than 1 myr @xcite .",
    "observational studies of agns also suggest that the observed agn eddington ratios range from @xmath6 to @xmath7 for agn hosts with similar properties @xcite .",
    "recent evidence for rapid agn variability over a large dynamic range in accretion rate comes from the discovery of giant ionized clouds around galaxies with little or no current agn activity @xcite , indicating a drop in agn luminosity by @xmath8 in @xmath9 years .",
    "there is also observational evidence in the x - ray fe k@xmath10 echoes from the quiescent smbh in the center of the milky way , suggesting it might have been a low - luminosity agn a few hundred years ago ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to the accretion rate of an individual smbh , the galactic sfr is relatively stable .",
    "even short - lived starbursts last @xmath11 myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is still much longer than the timescale of agn variability .",
    "the key quantity to study may therefore be the _ average _ agn luminosity of a population , which thus smoothes over the variations of individual sources .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have discovered that the shape of the distribution function of the agn eddington ratio is independent of the properties of the hosting galaxies , thus the average agn luminosity is a reliable tool to study the long - term black hole accretion rate in any sample of galaxies .",
    "measuring star formation rates in agn host galaxies can be challenging because of obscuring dust and contamination from agn .",
    "detailed spectral template fitting is required to disentangle agn and star forming activities in optical or mid - ir observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the stellar mass @xmath121 is only weakly correlated with sfr in active star - forming galaxies ( e.g. sfr@xmath122 yr@xmath123 ) .",

    "agns with the highest luminosity are rare in this redshift range ( and so might not be detected in our survey volume ) but may contribute significantly to the @xmath118 of our sample .",
    "we estimated the contribution of these rare , extremely luminous agns to the @xmath118 using the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) from @xcite .",
    "we note that the agn xlf was not designed to represent the x - ray luminosity from the sources without direct x - ray observations , thus we first estimated the effect of limited volume on the sources that were identified as agns in our sample , i.e. @xmath125 erg s@xmath17 ; then we calculated the effect on the full population by adjusting the result from detected agns based on the agn detection fraction . in detail , at the average redshift range of each sfr bin of our sample , we first calculated the `` intrinsic '' average agn luminosity by directly integrating the xlf at @xmath125 erg s@xmath17 .",

    "for the bin with the highest sfr , the stacked x - ray luminosity is still higher than @xmath129 by a factor of two .",
    "this shows that while the galaxies we stacked were not identified as agns neither using the common x - agn selection criterion of @xmath125 erg s@xmath17 nor the irac color - color selection method , a significant fraction of the average @xmath31 for these star - forming galaxies arises from smbh accretions .",
    "we stress that the @xmath118 used in our primary analysis is the average @xmath31 due to smbh accretion only , which was determined by subtracting the expected sf contribution .",
    "we note that in an x - ray stacking study in the same botes  survey region , @xcite concluded that the spectroscopically selected late - type galaxies have their x - ray luminosities dominated by hmxbs .",
    "however , the sample in @xcite are galaxies with lower star formation rates at lower redshifts .",
    "the stacked @xmath31 in the lowest sfr bin in our work is still in agreement with their sample at comparable sfr .",
    "using our methods , deeper far - ir observations would be required to probe the more moderate sfr galaxies studied by @xcite .",
    "we identify that there might be observational bias in the bhar to sfr correlation in our sample due the flux limits .",
    "the limited flux would cause galaxies with high sfr to be preferentially found at higher redshift .",
    "this bias translates into the different average redshift in each bin ( @xmath145 in the 4 bins of sfr , from low to high . )",

    "* ) and bhar density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that the sfr and bhar densities are higher at higher redshift ( up to @xmath146 ) .",
    "thus , when dividing galaxies into bins of sfr in a flux - limited sample , even if the @xmath31 and @xmath50 are completely uncorrelated in individual galaxies , the redshift evolutions of the xlf and the infrared luminosity function ( irlf ) would naturally yield a @xmath31-@xmath50 relation .    to account for the selection bias due to this effect and to test",
    "whether the redshift coevolution of the sfr density and the bhar density is the dominant factor driving the @xmath31-@xmath50 correlation observed in this work , we examined the sample by directly computing the effect of the redshift evolution of the x - ray luminosity density ( xld , e.g. * ? ? ? * a10 hereafter ) . in principle , if there is no bhar - sfr correlation in individual galaxies , the observed difference of the @xmath118 between the bins with the lowest and the highest sfr should be consistent with the pure redshift evolution of the xld .",
    "we found that in our sample , the pure redshift evolution of the a10 xld in the range of the average redshifts in our bins would translate into a difference in @xmath118 of 0.47 dex .",

    "for the rest of galaxies , we assumed their x - ray luminosities to be 0 .",
    "since the ir luminosity distribution and x - ray luminosity distribution were derived independently , there is no intrinsic correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath50 in our mock catalog . to test the effects of the redshift evolution in xlf and the possible malmquist bias",

    "@xcite,@xcite and @xcite show that a substantial population of agns spend most of their lifetime accreting at lower eddington ratio .",
    "hence the smbh growth during the lower eddington ratio state can not be neglected . in this vein , and considering that agn may vary by over 5 orders of magnitude in eddington ratio on a timescale much shorter than that of galactic star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the average bhar might be underestimated due to non - detections of a substantial population of heavily obscured agns , which can be responsible for as much as @xmath155 of smbh growth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    in summary",
