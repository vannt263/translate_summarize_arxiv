    "solar energetic particles ( seps ) were first reported by @xcite . since coronal mass ejection ( cme ) was not discovered at that time , seps were assumed to be accelerated by solar flare .",
    "if this holds true , it is reasonable to assume that the size of seps source is close to that of flare .",
    "however , some sep events could be simultaneously observed by multi - spacecraft with very wide spatial distribution which could be much wider than the size of flare . in order to interpret this phenomenon ,",
    "two scenarios were proposed : ( 1 ) particles can cross * magnetic field * lines in the interplanetary space with perpendicular diffusion ; and ( 2 ) particles can propagate in the solar atmosphere .",
    "but later the sep community realized that cmes are important for particle acceleration , especially in large sep events @xcite .",
    "as a result , besides the former two scenarios , the third one was proposed : * the * wide spread of seps can be explained by that seps are accelerated by large scale shocks .",
    "however , large sep events are usually associated with * both * flares and cmes , so the role of flare and shock in * the * acceleration process of seps is still in debate . for historical development of the studies on sep source",
    ", please refer to the review articles by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "because of the effects of particle transport , it is difficult to distinguish * the * signatures of different accelerators in sep fluxes at 1 au .",
    "however , sep fluxes observed in the interplanetary space show velocity dispersion at the onset time . the velocity dispersion analysis ( vda )",
    "method has been used widely to investigate the sep acceleration and transport * processes * @xcite .",
    "this method assumes that the first arriving particles move along the magnetic field lines , and the path length * travelled * by particles between the source and observer is independent on energy . with these assumptions ,",
    "the sep release time near the sun and the interplanetary path length can be determined by using the onset * times * of different energy particles . * in addition * , to compare the sep release time with the electromagnetic signature of sep source , the sep source can be identified .",
    "it has been known for a long time that when the observer is far from the magnetic connection point of the source on the sun , the onset time of seps flux shows a delay @xcite .",
    "this would lead to changes in the results of vda method .",
    "@xcite calculated the release time near the sun and path length in the interplanetary space of seps with @xmath3 short electron events observed by * the * wind spacecraft .",
    "the result of vda method indicates two kinds of electron events . in the first kind of events ,",
    "the electron release time is extremely close to the onset of a radio type iii burst when the observer is connected to the flare . in the second kind of events ,",
    "the electrons are released much later ( e.g. , half an hour ) than the onset of the type iii burst when the observer is disconnected from the flare .",
    "studied the release time of mev / n protons and heliums observed by soho / erne .",
    "they found that the delay in seps release time derived from vda method is related to the poor magnetic connection between the flare site and the spacecraft .",
    "for extremely high energy particle events , @xcite studied the onset time of ion fluxes in ground - level enhancements .",
    "they * concluded that * the time difference between the solar particle release time and the onset time of metric type ii radio burst increases with the angular distance of the observer s magnetic foot - point and the source increase .    according to different heliographic latitude observation",
    ", @xcite analyzed an sep event simultaneously observed by * the * ulysses and goes spacecraft .",
    "the goes spacecraft is located * in the ecliptic * , while the ulysses is located at @xmath4 south .",
    "the * sep * release time derived from goes data is consistent with the onset of soft x - ray flux , and the path length is also close to the parker spiral .",
    "in contrast , the release time derived from ulysses data is @xmath5 hours later than the onset of soft x - ray , and the path length is much longer than parker spiral . *",
    "further studies * were done by @xcite , who analysed @xmath6 sep events observed by ulysses at high latitudes among which @xmath7 events are observed at * latitudes * more than @xmath8 , and * the rest * event is observed at @xmath9 latitude . @xcite",
    "found that the path lengths * derived from the ulysses data * are @xmath10 to @xmath11 times the length of parker spiral , and the particle release * times are * between @xmath12 and @xmath13 min later than * that * derived from * the * soho and wind measurements .",
    "the delay in particle release time increases with the latitudinal difference @xmath14 between the spacecraft and the flare . *",
    "based on the delay of particle release time derived from in - ecliptic measurements relative to that from high latitudes measurements * , we can conclude that * such kind of delay * is related to the poor connection between the source and spacecraft .    in order to use the vda method",
    "more reasonably , many studies have been done to investigate the validity of * the * method .",
    "the following are their main conclusions : firstly , when the parallel mean free path ( mfp ) is large enough ( @xmath15 au ) , interplanetary scattering has only a small effect on the derived solar release time . secondly ,",
    "when the background level is below @xmath16 of the peak intensity of flux , the onset time of sep event can be determined quite accurately @xcite . in the above works ,",
    "the interplanetary scattering and background level effects in the release time have been studied in detail . in this paper , we study how different source models and perpendicular diffusion * affect * the onset time of sep and the vda results . in section 2",

    "comparing table [ weakscattering ] with table [ strongscattering ] , the path lengths obtained from vda method in table [ weakscattering ] are smaller than that in table [ strongscattering ] .",
    "table [ sourcediffusion ] is similar to table [ strongscattering ] except the source model and mean free path . in table",
    "[ sourcediffusion ] , the source model is set as the case 2 of equation [ boundarycondition ] , and particles can diffuse at the source region .",
    "the source parameters are set to @xmath87 , @xmath109 day , and @xmath110 day in all six cases .",
    "when @xmath103 is set to @xmath104 au for @xmath1 mev protons * in the ecliptic * at @xmath0 au , the * propagation * effect of particles in the solar atmosphere is stronger than that of * the * perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space . in cases 1 , 2 , and 3 , @xmath103 is set to @xmath104 au for @xmath1 mev protons , while @xmath103 is set to @xmath106 au for @xmath1 mev protons in cases 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "comparing the cases 1 , 2 , and 3 in table [ sourcediffusion ] with the * impulsive * duration cases in table [ strongscattering ] , we have the following findings .",
    "the vda release times are much closer to the injection times on the source in table [ sourcediffusion ] than that in table [ strongscattering ] , and the path lengths in table [ sourcediffusion ] are generally smaller than that in table [ strongscattering ] . the difference between the vda release times and the injection times",
    "are within @xmath111 minutes . comparing the cases 4 , 5 , and 6 in table [ sourcediffusion ] with the * impulsive * duration cases in table [ weakscattering ] , we find that the vda results are similar in these two tables especially in the low background case .",
    "this is because when @xmath103 is set to @xmath106 au for @xmath1 mev protons at 1 au equatorial plane , the effect of perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space is stronger than that of particles propagation in the solar atmosphere .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the uncertainty of the simple assumptions of vda method .",
    "firstly , the vda results could be significantly * affected * by interplanetary scattering . . secondly , the onset time of sep event is hard to be determined in practical applications , since it can be significantly delayed by the background level @xcite .",
    "thirdly , particles can cross the field lines when they transport in the space .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion plays a very important role in the release time determination , especially when the observer s field line is disconnected from the source @xcite .",
    "fourthly , different source models affect the accuracy of results of vda method .",
    "for example , particles accelerated by a flare may directly propagate in the solar atmosphere @xcite ; and a large shock could provide a very wide source @xcite .    by numerically solving the focused fokker - planck equation ,",
    "we have calculated seps intensity time profiles including the perpendicular diffusion .",
    "we set different source duration and background level to study the onset times observed by observers . comparing the time profiles of sep fluxes observed at different locations , we have studied the effect of different source models and perpendicular diffusion on the onset times of sep events , and its influence on the vda method results .",
    "our new findings are the following .",
    "\\(1 ) if seps are produced by a solar flare , they can spread much wider than the source region by two possible mechanisms . in the first one , particles propagate in the solar atmosphere . in the second one , particles cross the field lines in the interplanetary space with perpendicular diffusion . in this case , the vda results can be affected by the above two mechanisms when the observer is not connected to the source at * the * initial time . in addition , due to the effect of convection , more particles are injected in the field line of observer when * the * source is located at * the * east flank to the * foot - point * of observer than that in the case of * the * west flank .",
    "this effect would lead to * the * east - west asymmetry of seps distribution in the interplanetary space .",
    "\\(2 ) when the observer is connected to the source by * the * imf , comparing the time profiles of fluxes in the cases with and without perpendicular diffusion , or with and without particles propagation in the solar atmosphere , the onset times are much the same . in this case ,",
    "* the effects of particles * perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space and propagation in the solar atmosphere do not affect the results of vda significantly .",
    "the results obtained by previous simulations , which did nt include these two mechanisms , still holds when these two mechanisms are included .",
    "\\(3 ) if seps accelerated by a solar flare can not propagate in the solar atmosphere , the sep source region is about the size of solar flare . in this case ,",
    "when the observer is disconnected from the source by the imf , the energetic particles can be detected with the effect of the perpendicular diffusion .",
    "the onset time is later when the observer is disconnected from the source than that when the observer is connected to the source . in the cases of weak scattering ,",
    "the solar release time derived from vda method is close to the injection time when the observer is disconnected from the source with impulsive source duration and low background .",
    "however , in the cases of strong scattering , the release time and the path length obtained from the vda method are much different from the real values except some fortuitous cases .",
    "\\(4 ) if seps accelerated by a solar flare can propagate in the solar atmosphere , the sep source region should be larger than the size of solar flare as times go by . when the observer is far from the sep source at the initial time",
    ", particles will spend some time on leaving the source to the observer s field line . as a result , the time scale of rising phase of flux is larger than that in the case when the observer is connected to the center of source . when source diffusion in the solar atmosphere is faster than perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space , the solar release time derived from vda method is close to injection time when the observer is disconnected from the source with low background .",
    "if source diffusion in the solar atmosphere is slower than perpendicular diffusion , the vda results are significantly affected by the mean free path . in the case of weak scattering ,",
    "the solar release time derived from vda method is still valid with impulsive source duration and low background .",
    "however , in the case of strong scattering , the solar release time derived from vda method is not valid .",
    "\\(5 ) if seps are accelerated by a large scale corona shock , the source can cover * a * very wide region due to the size of corona shock .",
    "the observers located at different locations can be connected to the sun simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the effects of particles propagating in the solar atmosphere and perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary space have little * effect * on the onset time of sep fluxes and the vda results , and the accuracy of vda * method * depends on other conditions . if the time profile of sep source does not change with the angular distance between the foot - point of observer s magnetic field line and the center of the source , the onset time of fluxes observed at different locations could be much the same . in this case",
    ", the vda results do not change with the angular distance .",
    "otherwise , the time profile of sep source changes with the angular distance , the onset time of sep flux and the vda results will change with * the angular distance . *",
    "\\(6 ) in our simulations , the vda results could be significantly * affected * by the location and size of sep source .",
    "as it is shown in previous studies , the vda results are also significantly affected by the time profile of source , parallel mean free path , and background level . in order to reduce error in the results of vda method ,",
    "an ideal sep event should meet the following conditions , such as , * impulsive * source duration , large parallel mean free path , low background level , and good connection between the observer and the source .",
