    "the gas - phase metallicity ( hereafter , metallicity ) is a fundamental parameter for the understanding of formation and evolution of galaxies , because it traces past star formation activity ; metals in gas are produced in stars formed and returned into the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies .",
    "the metallicity is also affected by inflow and outflow of gas .",
    "thus , by investigating the metallicity and its cosmological evolution , the star formation history of galaxies together with the gas inflow and outflow can be constrained .",
    "the presence of a correlation between stellar mass and metallicity ( hereafter , mass - metallicity relation ) in the local universe is well known .",
    "@xcite established the mass - metallicity relation at @xmath12 with a large sample ( @xmath15 ) of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxies .",
    "tracing the cosmological evolution of the mass - metallicity relation is indispensable to reveal how galaxies have been evolving . at @xmath16",
    ", the mass - metallicity relations and the downsizing - like evolution to @xmath12 were found ; the less evolution can be seen in the massive part ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the anti - downsizing - like evolution of the mass - metallicity relations were also presented at similar redshifts @xcite .",
    "the mass - metallicity relations were obtained at @xmath17 by using @xmath18 galaxies @xcite and at @xmath13 by @xmath19 galaxies @xcite and the smooth evolution of the mass - metallicity relation from @xmath13 to @xmath14 is suggested . however , at @xmath17 , higher metallicities at a given stellar mass have been reported @xcite than those found by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy at @xmath17 may be partly due to the small size of their samples ( @xmath20 ) . since the redshift of @xmath21 is close to the peak epoch in the cosmic star - formation history",
    ", establishing the mass - metallicity relation at this redshift is very important .",
    "although the metallicity correlates well with stellar mass , there is a scatter in the relation .",
    "its origin may provide a clue to understand the process of the chemical enrichment and may be related to how the mass - metallicity relation evolves . at @xmath12 , @xcite found that the mass - metallicity relation has an intrinsic scatter of @xmath11 and the scatter is larger at the lower stellar mass . at a given stellar mass ,",
    "galaxies with higher surface stellar mass density tends to show higher metallicity , suggesting that they transformed more gas into stars raising the metallicity .",
    "@xcite showed that galaxies with larger specific star - formation rate ( sfr ) and size show lower metallicity at a given stellar mass at @xmath12 .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite found that galaxies with larger sfrs tend to show lower metallicities at @xmath12 and the scatter around the mass - metallicity relation is reduced very much ( i.e. , the fundamental metallicity relation ) by introducing sfr as the second parameter affecting the metallicity .",
    "the scatter of the mass - metallicity relation , however , is still unclear at higher redshifts because of the limited sample size . in order to investigate these trends",
    "further , including the dependency of other parameters , at higher redshift , a large near - infrared spectroscopic survey is necessary , which is very time consuming and hard to achieve .",
    "the fiber multi object spectrograph ( fmos ) on the subaru telescope enables us to survey a large spectroscopic sample at high redshifts .",
    "fmos is a near infrared ( nir ) fiber multi - spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the fiber positioner `` echidna '' at the prime focus feeds 400 fibers in a fov of diameter .",
    "two nir spectrographs ( irs1 and irs2 ) with an oh airglow suppression system are capable of obtaining both low resolution ( @xmath22 ) and high resolution ( @xmath23 ) spectra in the wavelength range of @xmath24@xmath25 m . taking advantage of the multiplicity available with fmos , we are conducting a large spectroscopic survey for star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 .",
    "this redshift range is of much interest , because it is near or shortly after the peak epoch in the cosmic star formation history ( e.g. , @xcite ) and thus important for the history of the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is also suitable for fmos , because in the redshift range [ n]@xmath266548,6584 , h@xmath4 , [ o]@xmath264959,5007 , and h@xmath27 lines are located in the wavelength range observable with fmos . in this paper",

    "this primary sample size is very large , and many of the sample galaxies may show very faint h@xmath4 emission lines . thus in order to make an efficient survey , and as a first step , we selected objects for which expected h@xmath4 flux is larger than 1.0@xmath7210@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 @xmath8 as the secondary sample . this selection could introduce some bias for the sample , hence the effects will be considered later based on the results obtained .    in figure",

    "the secondary sample is also shown with blue open circles .",
    "the distribution is slightly shifted toward larger sfr at a given stellar mass particularly in less massive part .",
    "this is due to the fact that we selected objects with larger expected h@xmath4 flux and thus larger intrinsic sfr .",

    "we cross - correlated to the mips sources , and we found that the detection rate in mips is significantly lower for these objects than for other objects .",
    "the estimation of these high sfrs may be incorrect partly because the @xmath59 is overestimated due to the dust / age degeneracy .",

    "then the obtained 2d spectra are corrected for the distortion and residual sky subtraction are also carried out .",
    "the obtained spectra are combined for the total exposures . since the spectrum of one target",
    "is obtained by two fibers in the cbs mode , the final spectrum of one target is obtained by merging the cbs pair spectra .",
    "the wavelength calibration is done by using th - ar lamp frames .",
    "the uncertainty associated with the wavelength calibration is @xmath89 .",
    "the relative flux calibration was done by using several f , g or k - type stars selected based on @xmath90 and @xmath91 colors and observed simultaneously with other scientific targets .",
    "the uncertainty of the relative flux calibration is @xmath92 at @xmath93 m .",
    "the absolute flux is determined from the observed count rate by assuming the total throughput of the instrument , which is calibrated by using the moderately bright stars ( @xmath9416 mag in @xmath37- or @xmath38-band ) in the best weather conditions ( @xmath94 ) in previous engineering observations .",
    "the uncertainty of the absolute flux calibration itself is estimated to be @xmath95 .",
    "however , there may be additional uncertainties ( @xmath96 ) that come from variation of the atmospheric transmission and the seeing conditions .    in total ,",
    "317 objects were observed and for 71 objects the h@xmath4 emission line was detected with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) larger than 3 , where the noise level is measured from the continuum in a wavelength window of @xmath97 m from the emission line .",

    "in order to measure a spec-@xmath46 , a flux of an emission line , and a line width , we made a model fit to the reduced one - dimensional emission line profile .",
    "this process is straightforward in the usual spectroscopy . in our case , however , we need rather complicated processes .",
    "fmos uses an oh suppression system to remove the strong oh airglow sky emission lines .",
    "the dispersed light is focused onto the mask mirror with a resolving power of @xmath23 ( @xmath105 km s@xmath7 ) and is rejected by the oh masks .",
    "then the spectrum is anti - dispersed by vph grating to @xmath22 ( @xmath106 km s@xmath7 ) and focused onto the detector ( see @xcite for the optical design of fmos ) .",
    "since the reduced spectra are divided by a spectrum of the calibration star in the relative flux calibration process of the pipeline , the effect of the oh - mask on the continuum light is corrected in the final reduced spectra .",
    "the correction , however , is not appropriate for emission lines if the line width is relatively small .",
    "thus we present two different ways of the spectral fitting .",
    "one is fitting with model spectra taking into account the mask effects , and the other is fitting the observed spectra without taking the mask effects into consideration . in both cases , we subtracted the continuum by fitting with third - order polynomials in the wavelength range of 1.45@xmath531.70@xmath25 m .",
    "in the former method ( _ method1 _ ) , we fit model spectra including the oh - mask effect to the observed spectra .",
    "the model spectra are generated as follows : an intrinsic spectrum is modeled by a multi - gaussian function with h@xmath4 and [ n]@xmath102@xmath1026548,6584 lines .",
    "we assume that ratio of [ n]@xmath1026584 and [ n]@xmath1026548 is 3.0 , the line widths are the same as that of h@xmath4 , and there is no systematic shift between h@xmath4 line and [ n ] lines .",
    "each spectrum is parametrized by four parameters : redshift , amplitude of h@xmath4 , amplitude of [ n]@xmath1026584 , and line width .",
    "the spectrum represented by these parameters is convolved to a resolution of @xmath107 , and then , the flux density in the regions ( @xmath108 ) of the oh - masks is set to be zero .",
    "the obtained spectrum is convolved to a low - resolution spectrum with @xmath84 .    in order to correct the continuum level affected by the oh - suppression , a flat spectrum in @xmath109 without emission lines mimicking a star used in the flux calibration",
    "is processed in the same manner as described above .",
    "the correction factors as a function of wavelength are derived from the resulting spectrum divided by the input flat spectrum . the model spectrum with emission lines",
    "is corrected by using this correction factor in order to compare with the observed spectrum",
    ". a schematic view of line profiles affected by the oh - mask is presented in figure [ spectrasim ] .",
    "the fitting process is carried out using _ mpfit _ package @xcite which implements non - linear least square fitting with standard levenberg - marquardt algorithm . in the fitting procedure , we search for the minimum @xmath47 in the parameter space of the four parameters described above .",
    "the resulting @xmath47 maps of fits show that there are no pronounced discontinuities or strong degeneracies between the parameters .    for the latter method ( _ method2 _ )",
    ", we simply fit the observed spectrum by the multi - gaussian profile .",
    "the fitting procedure is generally the same as _ method1_. the fitting models are multi - gaussian functions , but without taking the mask loss corrections into consideration .     of 200 km s@xmath7 in the hr mode and",
    "that absorbed by the oh - mask are indicated by a _ dotted line _ and a _ thin solid line _ , respectively .",
    "the absorbed spectrum degraded to the lr is indicated by a _",
    "thin dashed line_. the spectrum corrected for the mask effects by using continuum light is indicated by a _",
    "thick solid line _ ; this is the obtained spectrum after data reduction .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum degraded to the lr without considering the mask effect is shown by a _ thick dashed line _ as a reference .",
    "see also text for details.[spectrasim ] ]            in order to quantify the effects of the oh - masks and to evaluate the accuracy of the two methods , we generate artificial spectra with one emission line and no continuum , varying the line widths ( 50 @xmath53 1000 km s@xmath7 ) and fluxes ( 1.0@xmath7210@xmath110 @xmath53 1.0 @xmath72 10@xmath111 erg s@xmath7 @xmath8 ) , which cover the ranges of widths and fluxes of most of the emission lines detected with s / n @xmath5 1.5 .",

    "the recovery rate of the flux against the amount of the loss by the mask is presented in figure [ fig_sim ] .",

    "the recovery of the flux improves if the line width is larger .",
    "for instance , the flux can be recovered within @xmath11620% accuracy if the line width is @xmath68600 km s@xmath7 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the flux is overestimated by _",
    "method2 _ in some cases , because the line profile is overcorrected by the correction for the continuum : if a large part a pixel covers an oh - mask and the peak of a narrow emission line just outside of the mask , the flux loss rate in the pixel for the continuum is larger than that for the emission line .",

    "<S> we present near - infrared spectroscopic observations of star - forming galaxies at @xmath0 with fmos on the subaru telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we observed k - band selected galaxies in the sxds / uds fields with @xmath1 mag , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and expected f(h@xmath4 ) @xmath5 10@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> 71 objects in the sample have significant detections of h@xmath4 . for these objects , excluding possible agns identified from the bpt diagram , gas - phase metallicities are obtained from [ n]/h@xmath4 line ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is split into three stellar mass bins , and the spectra are stacked in each stellar mass bin . the mass - metallicity relation obtained at @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is located between those at @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain an intrinsic scatter to be @xmath11 dex or larger in the mass - metallicity relation at @xmath0 ; the scatter may be larger at higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we found trends that the deviation from the mass - metallicity relation depends on the sfr and the half light radius : galaxies with higher sfr and larger half light radii show lower metallicities at a given stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> one possible scenario for the trends is the infall of pristine gas accreted from igm or through merger events . </S>",
    "<S> our data points show larger scatter than the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) at @xmath12 and the average metallicities slightly deviate from the fmr . the compilation of the mass - metallicity relations at @xmath13 to @xmath12 shows that they evolve smoothly from @xmath13 to @xmath14 without changing the shape so much except for the massive part at @xmath14 . </S>"
