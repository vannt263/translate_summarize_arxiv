    "topcolor assisted technicolor  @xcite is a model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking in which the top quark is heavy because of a new dynamics .",
    "topcolor replaces the @xmath4 of qcd with @xmath5 for the third quark generation and @xmath6 for the first two generations .",
    "the additional su(3 ) symmetry produces a @xmath7 condensate which makes the top quark heavy , and gives rise to a color octet gauge boson , the topgluon b. the topgluon is expected to be wide ( @xmath8 ) and massive ( @xmath9 tev ) . in hadron collisions it is produced through a small coupling to the first two generations , and then decays via a much larger coupling to the third generation : @xmath10 .",
    "here we estimate the mass reach for topgluons decaying to @xmath0 at the tevatron .",
    "the sub - process cross section for @xmath11 from both qcd and topgluons is given by  @xcite @xmath12 for a topgluon of mass @xmath13 and width @xmath14 given by @xmath15 \\label{eq_width}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the strong coupling evaluated at renormalization scale @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are subprocess mandelstam variables , @xmath20 is the mixing angle between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath21 is the scattering angle between the top quark and the initial state quark in the center of mass frame , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the top quark mass .",
    "topcolor requires @xmath24 to make the top quark heavy . in eq .",
    "[ eq_width ] , the first term in square brackets is for four light quarks , and the second term has two components , the first for the bottom quark and the second for massive top quarks . in eq .  [ eq_xsec ] , the 1 inside the absolute value brackets is for the normal qcd process @xmath25 .",
    "the other term inside the brackets is the breit - wigner topgluon resonance term for the process @xmath26 .",
    "the two processes interfere constructively to the left of the mass peak and destructively to the right of the mass peak .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton ] we have convoluted eq .",

    "[ fig_parton ] also includes the qcd process @xmath29 which is only significant at low mass . in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]1a we plot the differential cross section @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system .",
    "a clear distortion of the qcd @xmath0 spectrum is caused by the presence of a topgluon in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]a .",
    "after subtraction of the qcd background , fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]b shows that the signal has a very long high tail to low masses , caused by the combination of constructive interference and parton distributions that rise rapidly as the @xmath0 mass decreases .",
    "the tail is larger than the peak , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]b . nevertheless , the ratio between the topgluon signal and the qcd background , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_parton]c , displays a noticeable peak close to the topgluon mass .",
    "similar calculations have been performed for the masses 600 , 800 , 1200 , and 1400 gev .",
    "for topgluons of width @xmath32 , the measured @xmath0 mass peak should have a resonance shape similar to the parton level distribution , since the detector mass resolution for @xmath0 ( @xmath33% at @xmath34 gev ) is significantly finer than the topgluon width . to calculate the discovery mass reach we integrate both the lowest order topgluon cross section and the qcd background within the range @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting total topgluon signal in the @xmath0 channel is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_reach ] . the resulting background rate in this mass range is used to find the 5 @xmath36 discovery cross section .",
    "this is conservatively defined as the cross section which is above the background by 5 @xmath36 , where @xmath36 is the statistical error on the measured cross section ( not the background ) .",
    "for example , if the background were zero events the @xmath37 discovery rate would be 25 events . to obtain the discovery cross section we used both the luminosity and a 6.5% @xmath0 reconstruction efficiency at cdf in run ii  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig_reach ] we compare the topgluon signal cross section to the 5 @xmath36 discovery cross section for two different luminosities : 2 fb@xmath2 for tevatron collider run ii and 30 fb@xmath2 for tev33 .",
    "the topgluon discovery mass reach , defined as the mass at which a topgluon would be discovered with a 5@xmath36 signal , is tabulated in table i as a function of integrated luminosity and topgluon width .",
    "the mass reach decreases with increasing width , caused by worsening    signal to background within the search window .",
    "the width as a function of mixing angle , from eq .",
    "[ eq_width ] , is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_parton]d and [ fig_reach]d . also shown is the preferred theoretical range for the mixing angle @xmath38 , determined from the topcolor model and constraints from other data  @xcite , which implies a width of the topgluon in the range @xmath8 .",
    "+   +   + table i : the 5@xmath36 discovery mass reach of the tevatron in run ii ( 2 fb@xmath2 ) and tev33 ( 30 fb@xmath2 ) for a toplguon decaying to @xmath0 as a function of its fractional width ( @xmath39 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the discovery mass reach estimate we have not included any systematic uncertainties on the measured signal , and we have assumed that the shape and magnitude of the qcd @xmath0 spectrum will be well understood . we have not included any other sources of background , such as qcd w + jets .",
    "also , our efficiency and resolution values are for reconstructing @xmath0 decaying into w + four jets where two of the jets are b - tagged .",
    "this efficiency and resolution may degrade at very high @xmath0 mass values , because the byproducts from high @xmath40 top decay will be closer together , and modifications to the reconstruction technique may be necessary to preserve the efficiency and resolution . adding systematics on the signal and the background will decrease the mass reach of a real search .",
    "another method of searching for topgluons is simply to measure the total @xmath0 cross section and compare it with qcd . in fig .",
    "[ fig_total ] we show the fractional effect of a topgluon on the total @xmath0 cross section : ( topgluon - qcd)/qcd .",
    "this is compared with the total @xmath0 cross section measurements from cdf ( @xmath41 pb  @xcite ) . and d0 ( @xmath42 pb  @xcite ) , both of which are compatible with qcd ( 5 pb  @xcite ) within errors . in fig .",
    "[ fig_total ] the location of the cdf and d0 points on the horizontal axis is arbitrary ; the measured cross section and error give a location on the vertical axis only .",
    "the tev2000 group projected the @xmath43 uncertainty on the top quark cross section measurement will be 11% with 1 fb@xmath2 , 5.9% with 10 fb@xmath2 , and 5.1% with 100 fb@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this estimate included systematic uncertainties . in fig  [ fig_total ]",
    "we multiply these numbers by a factor of 1.64 to obtain 95% cl upper bounds , and multiply them by a factor of 5 to obtain @xmath37 discovery cross sections , shown as horizontal dashed lines for luminosities of 1 , 10 and 100 fb@xmath2 .",
    "we interpolate between these luminosity values to estimate the @xmath37 discovery cross section for 2 fb@xmath2 in run ii is 50% of the qcd cross section , and the @xmath37 discovery cross section for 30 fb@xmath2 at tev33 is 28% of the qcd cross section .",
    "these fractional deviations in the qcd cross section correspond to a topgluon mass reach of @xmath44 tev for 2 fb@xmath2 , depending on the topgluon width , and about @xmath45 tev for 30 fb@xmath2 .",
    "this assumes we understand the total qcd cross section for @xmath0 production to much better than 50% in run ii and much better than 28% at tev33 .",
    "this may not be unreasonable , considering the theoretical systematic uncertainties on the @xmath0 cross section prediction are currently around 10 - 20%  @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the estimate of the topgluon mass reach using the total @xmath0 cross section agrees with our estimate of the mass reach from the bump search in a 25% mass window .",
    "this increases our confidence that the estimated mass reach is reasonable .",
    "we have used a parton level prediction for @xmath0 production from qcd and topgluons , together with the projected experimental efficiency for reconstructing @xmath0 , to estimate the topgluon discovery mass reach in a @xmath0 resonance search .",
    "the topgluon discovery mass reach , @xmath46 tev for run ii and @xmath3 tev for tev33 , covers a significant part of the expected mass range ( @xmath47 tev ) .",
    "the mass reach estimated using the total @xmath0 cross section is similar to that for the resonance search , providing an important check . for comparison ,",
    "the mass reach in the @xmath48 channel is estimated to be @xmath49 tev for run ii and @xmath50 tev for tev33  @xcite .",
    "this is less than the mass reach in the @xmath0 channel primarily because of larger @xmath48 backgrounds .",
    "if topgluons exist , there is a good chance we will find them at the tevatron , beginning the investigation into the origins of electroweak symmetry breaking",
