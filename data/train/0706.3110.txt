    "one of the most important results of the ulysses mission is the identification and characterization of a wide range of interstellar phenomena inside the solar system .",
    "a surprise was the identification of interstellar dust grains sweeping through the solar system @xcite . before this discovery",
    "it was believed that interstellar grains are prevented from reaching the planetary region by electromagnetic interaction with the solar wind magnetic field .",
    "the interplanetary zodiacal dust flux was thought to dominate the near - ecliptic planetary region while at high ecliptic latitudes only a very low flux of dust released from long - period comets should be present . therefore , the characterization of the interplanetary dust cloud was the prime goal of the ulysses dust investigation @xcite .",
    "ulysses was launched in october 1990 .",
    "a swing - by manoeuvre at jupiter in february 1992 rotated its orbital plane @xmath3 relative to the ecliptic plane ( with a six - year orbital period and aphelion distance at 5.4  au ; figure  [ trajectory ] ) .",
    "subsequent aphelion passages occurred in april 1998 and in june 2004 .",
    "a second jupiter flyby occurred in february 2004 .",
    "the best conditions for detection of interstellar impactors are in the outer solar system beyond 3  au at high ecliptic latitudes and far away from jupiter where impact rates of interplanetary grains or jovian stream particles are comparatively small .",
    "nevertheless , ulysses has continuously monitored the interstellar dust flux in the heliosphere since 1992 .",
    "we briefly review the results from in - situ interstellar dust measurements with the ulysses and other space - borne dust detectors in section  [ sec_review ] . in section  [ sec_meas ]",
    "we present the interstellar dust measurements from the ulysses @xmath4 passage through the outer heliosphere , and section  [ sec_discussion ] is a brief discussion of our results .",
    "interstellar dust particles originating from the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) move on hyperbolic trajectories through the solar system and approach ulysses predominantly from the direction opposite to the expected impact direction of interplanetary grains . on average , their impact velocities exceed the local solar system escape velocity , even if radiation pressure effects are neglected @xcite . the grain motion through the solar system was found to be parallel to the flow of neutral interstellar hydrogen and helium gas , both gas and dust travelling with a speed of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the interstellar dust flow persisted at high latitudes above and below the ecliptic plane and even over the poles of the sun , whereas interplanetary dust was strongly depleted at high ecliptic latitudes .",
    "later measurements with the galileo dust detector in the ecliptic plane confirmed the ulysses results : beyond about 3  au the interstellar dust flux exceeds the flux of micron - sized interplanetary grains . furthermore , interstellar dust is ubiquitous in the solar system : dust measurements between 0.3 and 3 au in the ecliptic plane exist also from helios , galileo and cassini .",
    "this data shows evidence for distance - dependent alteration of the interstellar dust stream caused by radiation pressure , gravitional focussing and electromagnetic interaction with the time - varying interplanetary magnetic field which also depends on grain size @xcite . as a result , the size distribution and fluxes of grains measured inside the heliosphere",
    "are strongly modified @xcite .",
    "interstellar grains observed with the spacecraft detectors range from @xmath6 to above @xmath7 . if we compare the mass distribution of these interstellar impactors detected in - situ with the dust mass distribution derived from astronomical observations , we find that the in - situ measurements overlap only with the largest masses observed by remote sensing .",
    "it indicates that the intrinsic size distribution of interstellar grains in the lic extends to grain sizes larger than those detectable by astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "even bigger interstellar grains ( above @xmath8 ) are observed as radar meteors entering the earth s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the flow direction of these larger grains varies over a much wider angular range than that of small particles measured by the in - situ detectors .    the total grain mass detected in - situ by ulysses , which includes bigger grains in the lic than those detectable with astronomical techniques , led to the conclusion that the lic gas is enhanced with the refractory elements ( e.g. fe , mg , mn ) that would ordinarily dominate the mass of interstellar dust grains .",
    "earlier investigations indicated an enhancement of the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the lic by up to a factor of five @xcite .",
    "recent reanalysis with improved solar heavy element abundances and an updated value for the sensitive area of the ulysses dust detector @xcite brought this enhancement down to a factor of two @xcite(slavin & frisch , this volume ) .",
    "in addition to the distribution of grain masses , the instrument has monitored the flux of interstellar dust particles through the heliosphere since ulysses left the ecliptic plane in 1992 ( figure  [ flux ] ) . in mid 1996 , a drop of the interstellar dust flux from initially @xmath9 to @xmath10 occurred @xcite . since early 2000 , ulysses has detected interstellar dust flux levels above @xmath11 again .",
    "the drop in 1996 was explained by increased filtering of small grains by the solar wind driven magnetic field during solar minimum conditions @xcite .",
    "the filtration caused a deficiency of detected interstellar grains with sizes below @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "an additional filtration by solar radiation pressure , which was found to be effective at heliocentric distances below @xmath13 , deflects grains with sizes of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "modelling the dynamics of the electrically charged dust grains in the heliosphere can give us information about the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) where the particles originate from .",
    "in the time interval 2001 to 2003 the interstellar dust flux stayed relatively constant , in agreement with improved models @xcite .",
    "the dominant contribution to the flux comes from grains with a charge to mass ratio @xmath15 and a radiation pressure efficiency of @xmath16 which  in the simulation  corresponds to a grain radius of @xmath17 ( assuming spherical grains ) .",
    "the models assume a constant dust concentration in the lic and give a good fit to the dust fluxes measured between end-1992 and end-2003 .",
    "the fact that the models fit the observed variations implies that the dust phase of the lic is homogeneously distributed over length scales of at least 50  au which is the distance inside the lic traversed by the sun during this time period .",
    "this result , however , needs to be reexamined in light of ulysses s most recent measurements obtained during the spacecraft s @xmath4 passage through the outer solar system .",
    "from 2002 to 2006 ulysses made its @xmath4 passage through the outer heliosphere ( aphelion passage occurred in june 2004 at a heliocentric distance of 5.4  au ) , providing again good conditions for measuring interstellar dust . in february 2004 , however , the spacecraft had its second jupiter flyby at a closest approach distance 0.8  au which also allowed for good measurement conditions for the dust streams emanating from the jovian system @xcite .",
    "a total of 28 streams were detected , more than twice the number of detections from ulysses first jupiter flyby in 1992 : the first stream was recorded in november 2002 when ulysses was still 3.4  au away from jupiter , and the last stream in mid-2005 at more than 4  au jovicentric distance .    in the outer solar system and at high ecliptic latitudes the interstellar impactors",
    "can usually be identified by their impact direction : they approach from a retrograde direction while the majority of interplanetary grains move on prograde heliocentric orbits . during most of the time in the 2002 to 2005 interval , however , the jovian dust streams approached from roughly the same direction @xcite , so that identification of interstellar grains by their impact direction alone was not possible .",
    "on the other hand , the measured impact charge distribution showed that the majority of grains with impact charges above @xmath19 are of interstellar origin while most jovian stream particles have impact charges below this limit .",
    "we therefore use this limit to separate both populations of impactors .",
    "contamination by jovian stream particles , however , can not entirely be excluded this way , and in particular the fluxes attributed to interstellar grains in 2004  when the instrument detected the most intensive jovian dust streams @xcite  may be contaminated by jovian impactors .",
    "hence , the data point in figure  [ flux ] showing an elevated interstellar flux in 2004 has to be taken with caution .",
    "on the other hand , in mid-2005 dust stream detections ceased , and in the later data the contribution by jovian stream particles should be negligible .",
    "90    90    figure  [ rot ] shows the impact directions of grains with impact charges @xmath20 for two different time intervals .",
    "the intervals were chosen such that ulysses was traversing approximately the same region of the outer solar system during both periods .",
    "contour lines show the effective dust sensor area for particles approaching from the upstream direction of interstellar helium @xcite , implying that the detection conditions for interstellar dust were very similar in both intervals .",
    "the approach directions of the majority of grains are consistent with the upstream direction of the interstellar helium flow .",
    "this is particularly evident in the earlier time interval 1996 to 2000 ( _ left panel _ in figure  [ rot ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that in this interval jupiter and ulysses were on opposite sides of the solar system , separated by more than 10  au , so that contributions by jovian stream particles can be excluded .",
    "the distribution of the measured rotation angles is also shown in figure  4 . in the 1997 to 1999 interval",
    "the average impact direction of the interstellar grains was at rotation angles of about @xmath21 .",
    "the interstellar impactors were still concentrated towards the interstellar helium flow direction in 2003 and 2004 ( _ right panel _ in figure  [ rot ] ) although the distribution of the measured rotation angles was somewhat wider .",
    "later , in 2005 , the impact directions were significantly shifted from the helium flow .",
    "this is also evident in the _ right panel _ of figure  4 : the mean rotation angle of the impactors is at @xmath22 rotation angle .",
    "taking into account that the detection geometry has slighly changed between the two time intervals , this implies that the interstellar dust flow has shifted by at least @xmath2 in southward direction , away from the ecliptic plane .",
    "the wider distribution of impact directions is also evident .",
    "the dust measurements from ulysses @xmath4 passage through the outer solar system imply an at least @xmath2 shift in the approach direction of interstellar dust grains .",
    "the reason for this shift remains mysterious .",
    "whether it is connected to a secondary stream of interstellar neutral atoms shifted from the main neutral gas flow @xcite is presently unclear .",
    "however , given that the neutral gas stream is shifted along the ecliptic plane while the shift in the dust flow is offset from the ecliptic , a connection between both phenomena seems unlikely .",
    "even though ulysses position in the heliosphere and the dust detection conditions were very similar during both time intervals considered here , the configurations of the solar wind driven interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) which affected the grain dynamics were vastly different .",
    "one has to take into account that the interstellar grains need approximately twenty years to travel from the heliospheric boundary to the inner solar system where they are detected by ulysses .",
    "thus , the effect of the imf on the grain dynamics is the accumulated effect caused by the interaction with the imf over several years .",
    "hence , in the earlier time interval ( 1997 - 1999 ) the grains had a recent dynamic history dominated by solar minimum conditions @xcite , while the grains detected during the second interval ( 2002 - 2005 ) had a recent history dominated by the much more disturbed solar maximum conditions of the imf .",
    "this latter configuration may have a strong influence on the dust dynamics in the inner heliosphere but it is not modeled in detail in the presently existing models .",
    "it may particularly affect small grains which are most sensitive to the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "one would expect a size - dependent shift in the grain impact direction which , however , is not evident in the data . whether these phenomena cause the observed shift in the approach direction of the interstellar dust grains will be the subject of future investigations .",
