    "in 1962 , josephson @xcite predicted theoretically that if a dc voltage @xmath7 is applied to a junction between two superconductors , ac supercurrent with the frequency @xmath8 appears between the superconductors .",
    "the ac josephson radiation was first observed experimentally 40 years ago in kharkov by yanson , svistunov , and dmitrenko @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectrum of microwave radiation from tin junctions was measured , and a sharp peak in the frequency spectrum at @xmath8 was found . it is amazing that without any attempt to match impedances of the junction and waveguide , dmitrenko and yanson @xcite found the signal several hundred times stronger than the noise and the ratio of linewidth to the josephson frequency less than @xmath9 .",
    "this discovery was followed by further work in the united states @xcite and ukraine @xcite .",
    "the results of these investigations were summarized in the classic book @xcite . since then , the ac josephson radiation has been observed in many materials in various experimental setups .",

    "@xcite , a peak of josephson radiation was observed around 11 ghz with the width 50 mhz in @xmath10 single crystals with the current along the @xmath11 axis perpendicular to the layers .",
    "the theory of the josephson effect was originally developed for conventional @xmath12-wave superconductors . in this paper",
    ", we study josephson junctions between unconventional superconductors , such as @xmath1-wave cuprates or @xmath0-wave organic superconductors .",
    "we show that the midgap andreev states in these materials produce a @xmath2-periodic relation between the josephson current @xmath3 and the phase difference @xmath4 : @xmath5 .",
    "consequently , the ac josephson current has the fractional frequency @xmath6 , a half of the conventional value .",
    "we hope that this effect can observed experimentally as the corresponding peak in the frequency spectrum of josephson radiation from unconventional superconductors , such as @xmath1-wave cuprates , in the manner similar to the pioneering experiments @xcite performed on conventional @xmath12-wave superconductors .",
    "in many materials , the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is unconventional , i.e.  not @xmath12-wave . in the high-@xmath13 cuprates ,",
    "it is the singlet @xmath14-wave @xcite .",
    "there is experimental evidence that , in the quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) organic superconductors @xmath15 @xcite , the symmetry is triplet @xcite , most likely the @xmath0-wave @xcite , where the @xmath16 axis is along the conducting chains .",
    "the unconventional pairing symmetry typically results in formation of midgap andreev bound states on the surfaces of these superconductors . for @xmath1-wave cuprate superconductors , the midgap andreev states were predicted theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite and discovered experimentally as a zero - bias conductance peak in tunneling between normal metals and superconductors ( see review @xcite ) . for the q1d organic superconductors , the midgap states were theoretically predicted to exist at the edges perpendicular to the chains @xcite .",
    "when two unconventional superconductors are joined together in a josephson junction , their andreev surface states hybridize to form andreev bound states in the junction .",
    "these states are important for the josephson current .",
    "andreev bound states in high-@xmath13 junctions were reviewed in ref .",

    ", we predict a new effect for josephson junctions between unconventional ( nonchiral ) superconductors , which we call the fractional ac josephson effect .",
    "suppose both superconductors forming a josephson junction have surface midgap states originally .",

    "we predict that the contribution of the hybridized andreev bound states produces a @xmath2-periodic relation between the supercurrent @xmath3 and the superconducting phase difference @xmath4 : @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the ac josephson effect has the frequency @xmath6 , where @xmath20 is the electron charge , @xmath7 is the applied dc voltage , and @xmath21 is the planck constant .",
    "the predicted frequency is a half of the conventional josephson frequency @xmath8 originating from the conventional josephson relation @xmath22 with the period of @xmath23 .",
    "qualitatively , the predicted effect can be understood as follows .",
    "the josephson current across the two unconventional superconductors is carried by tunneling of _ single electrons _ ( rather than cooper pairs ) between the two resonant midgap states .",
    "thus , the cooper pair charge @xmath24 is replaced the single charge @xmath20 in the expression for the josephson frequency .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the finding that , in the tunneling limit , the josephson current is proportional to the first power ( not square ) of the electron tunneling amplitude @xcite .",
    "possibilities for experimental observation of the fractional ac josephson effect are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] .",

    "thus , the transfer of a single electron is a virtual ( not real ) process .",
    "it must be followed by the transfer of another electron , so that the pair of electrons is absorbed into the condensate .",
    "this gives the current proportional to @xmath174 .",
    "this picture implies that the josephson supercurrent across the interface is carried by single electrons in the @xmath0-@xmath0 junction and by cooper pairs in the @xmath12-@xmath12 junction . because the single - electron charge @xmath20 is a half of the cooper - pair charge @xmath24 , the frequency of the ac josephson effect in the @xmath0-@xmath0 junction is @xmath6 , a half of the conventional josephson frequency @xmath8 for the @xmath12-@xmath12 junction .",
    "these conclusions also apply to a junction between two cuprate @xmath1-wave superconductors in such orientation that both sides of the junction have surface midgap states , e.g. to the @xmath18 junction ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : d - wave ] ) .    in both the @xmath0-@xmath0 and @xmath12-@xmath12 junctions , electrons transferred across the interface are taken away into the bulk by the supercurrent of cooper pairs . in the case of the @xmath0-@xmath0 junction ,",
    "a single transferred electron occupies a midgap state until another electron gets transferred .",
    "then the pair of electrons becomes absorbed into the bulk condensate , the midgap state returns to the original configuration , and the cycle repeats . in the case of the @xmath12-@xmath12 junction , two electrons",
    "are simultaneously transferred across the interface and become absorbed into the condensate .",
    "clearly , electric charge is transferred across the interface by single electrons at the rate proportional to @xmath161 in the first case and by cooper pairs at the rate proportional to @xmath174 in the second case , but the bulk supercurrent is carried by the cooper pairs in both cases .",
    "in this section , we study josephson junctions between two @xmath1-wave cuprate superconductors . as before ,",
    "we select the coordinate @xmath16 perpendicular to the junction line and assume that the electron momentum component @xmath33 parallel to the junction line is a conserved good quantum number . then , the 2d problem separates into a set of 1d solutions ( [ l0s ] ) in the @xmath16 direction labeled by the index @xmath33 . using an isotropic electron energy dispersion law @xmath177 , we replace the fermi momentum @xmath178 and velocity @xmath179 by their @xmath16-components @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "thus , the transmission coefficient d in eq .",
    "( [ zdg ] ) becomes @xmath33-dependent .",
    "the total josephson current is given by a sum over all occupied subgap states labeled by @xmath33 .",

    "the thick line represents the junction line .",
    "the circles illustrate the fermi surfaces , where positive and negative pairing potentials @xmath183 are shown by the solid and dotted lines .",
    "the points a , b , c , and d in the momentum space are connected by transmission and reflection from the barrier . ]    for the cuprates , let us consider a junction parallel to the @xmath184 $ ] crystal direction in the @xmath95-@xmath47 plane and select the @xmath16 axis along the diagonal @xmath185 $ ] , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - wave]a . in these coordinates ,",
    "the @xmath1-wave pairing potential is @xmath186 where the same notation as in eq .",
    "( [ hat - delta ] ) is used .",
    "direct comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ hat - delta - d ] ) and ( [ hat - delta ] ) demonstrates that the @xmath1-wave superconductor with the @xmath187 junction maps to the @xmath0-wave superconductor by the substitution @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the results obtained in sec .  [ sec : q1d ] for the @xmath0-@xmath0 junction apply to the @xmath18 junction between two @xmath1-wave superconductors with the appropriate integration over @xmath33 .",
    "the energies and the wave functions of the subgap andreev states in the @xmath18 junction are @xmath2-periodic , as in eqs .",
    "( [ e_p ] ) .",
    "thus the ac josephson current has the fractional frequency @xmath6 , as in eq .",
    "( [ i_t ] ) .    on the other hand , if the junction is parallel to the @xmath189 $ ] crystal direction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - wave]b , then @xmath190 .",
    "this pairing potential is an even function of @xmath191 , thus it is analogous to the @xmath12-wave pairing potential in eq .",
    "( [ hat - delta ] ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath182 junction between two @xmath1-wave superconductors is analogous to the @xmath12-@xmath12 junction .",
    "it should exhibit the conventional @xmath23-periodic josephson effect with the frequency @xmath8 .",
    "for a generic orientation of the junction line , the @xmath1-wave pairing potential acts like @xmath0-wave for some momenta @xmath33 and like @xmath12-wave for other @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the total josephson current is a sum of the unconventional and conventional terms @xcite : @xmath192 with some coefficients @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "we expect that both terms in eq .",
    "( [ i - phi/2 ] ) are present for any real junction between @xmath1-wave superconductors because of imperfections . however , the ratio @xmath195 should be maximal for the junction shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : d - wave]b .",
    "conceptually , the setup for experimental observation of the fractional ac josephson effect is straightforward .",
    "one should apply a dc voltage @xmath7 to the junction and measure frequency spectrum of microwave radiation from the junction , expecting to detect a peak at the fractional frequency @xmath6 . to observe the fractional ac josephson effect predicted in this paper",
    ", it is necessary to perform this experiment with the @xmath18 cuprate junctions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - wave](a ) . for control purposes , it is also desirable to measure frequency spectrum for the @xmath182 junction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - wave](b ) , where a peak at the frequency @xmath6 should be minimal .",
    "it should be absent completely in a conventional @xmath12-@xmath12 junction , unless the junction enters a chaotic regime with period doubling @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath13 junctions of the required geometry can be manufactured using the step - edge technique .",
    "bicrystal junctions are not appropriate , because the crystal axes @xmath196 and @xmath19 of the two superconductors are rotated relative to each other in such junctions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - wave](a ) , we need the junction where the crystal axes of the two superconductors have the same orientation .",
    "unfortunately , attempts to manufacture josephson junctions from the q1d organic superconductors @xmath15 failed thus far .",
    "the most common way of studying the ac josephson effect is observation of the shapiro steps @xcite . in this setup ,",
    "the josephson junction is irradiated by microwaves with the frequency @xmath197 , and steps in dc current are detected at the dc voltages @xmath198 .",
    "unfortunately , this method is not very useful to study the effect that we predict .",
    "indeed , our results are effectively obtained by the substitution @xmath199 .",
    "thus , we expect to see the shapiro steps at the voltages @xmath200 , i.e.  we expect to see only _ even _ shapiro steps . however , when both terms are present in eq .",
    "( [ i - phi/2 ] ) , they produce both even and odd shapiro steps , so it would be difficult to differentiate the novel effect from the conventional shapiro effect .",
    "notice also that the so - called fractional shapiro steps observed at the voltage",
    "@xmath201 corresponding to @xmath202 have nothing to do with the effect that we propose .",
    "they originate from the higher harmonics in the current - phase relation @xmath203 .",
    "the fractional shapiro steps have been observed in cuprates @xcite , but also in conventional @xmath12-wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "another method of measuring the current - phase relation in cuprates was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but connection with our theoretical results is not clear at the moment .",
    "in this paper , we study suitably oriented @xmath0-@xmath0 or @xmath1-@xmath1 josephson junctions , where the superconductors on both sides of the junction originally have the surface andreev midgap states . in such junctions ,",
    "the josephson current @xmath3 , carried by the hybridized subgap andreev bound states , is a @xmath2-periodic function of the phase difference @xmath4 : @xmath5 , in agreement with ref .",
    "thus , the ac josephson current should exhibit the fractional frequency @xmath6 , a half of the conventional josephson frequency @xmath8 . in the tunneling limit ,",
    "the josephson current is proportional to the first power of the electron tunneling amplitude , not the square as in the conventional case @xcite .",
