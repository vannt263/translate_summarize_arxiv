    "modal logics are valuable tools in computer science , since they are often a good compromise between expressiveness and decidability .",
    "standard applications of modal logics are in artificial intelligence @xcite , and cryptographic and other protocols @xcite .",
    "more recent applications include a new modal language called versatile event logic @xcite , and the usage to characterize the relationship among belief , information acquisition , and trust @xcite .",
    "applications of modal logic for solving practical problems obviously require a study of the computational complexity of various aspects of modal logics .",
    "a central computational problem related with any logic is the satisfiability problem , that is to decide whether a given formula has a model .",
    "the first complexity results for the modal satisfiability problem were achieved by ladner  @xcite .",
    "he showed that the basic modal satisfiability problem is @xmath0-complete .",
    "there is a rich literature on the complexity of variants of the modal satisfiability problem , important works include the paper by halpern and moses @xcite on multi - modal logics .",
    "recently , @xmath0-algorithms for a wide class of modal logics were presented by schrder and pattinson  @xcite .    for modal logics to be used in practice , a lower complexity of the satisfiability problem than the aforementioned @xmath0-hardness is desirable .",
    "it turns out that for many applications , the full power of modal logic is not necessary .",
    "there are various ways of defining restrictions of modal logics which potentially lead to a computationally easier version of the satisfiability problem that have been studied : variations of modal logics are achieved by restricting the class of considered models , e.g. , instead of allowing arbitrary graphs , classical examples of logics only allow reflexive , transitive , or symmetric graphs as models .",
    "many complexity results for logics defined in this way have been achieved : initial results for many important classes are present in the above - mentioned work by ladner  @xcite .",
    "recently , hemaspaandra and schnoor considered a uniform generalization of many of these examples  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that such restrictions do not necessarily decrease the complexity ; for many common restrictions , the complexity remains the same  @xcite and it is even possible that the complexity increases . in @xcite",
    ", hemaspaandra showed that the complexity of the global satisfiability problem increases from exptime - complete to undecidable by restricting the graphs to those in which every node has at least two successors and at most three 2-step successors .",
    "another way of restricting modal logics is to change the syntax rather than the semantics , i.e. , restrict the structure of the considered modal formulas .",
    "syntactical restrictions are known to naturally reduce the complexity of many decision problems in logic . in propositional logic ,",
    "well - known examples are the satisfiability problems for horn formulas , 2cnf formulas , or formulas describing monotone functions : all of these can be solved in polynomial time , while the general propositional satisfiability problem is @xmath2-complete .",
    "syntactical restrictions have been considered in the context of modal logics before : halpern showed that the complexity of the modal satisfiability problem decreases to linear time when restricting the number of variables and nesting degree of modal operators @xcite . restricted modal languages where only a subset of the relevant modal operators are allowed have been studied in the context of linear temporal logic ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "some description logics can be viewed as modal logic with a restriction on the propositional operators that are allowed . for the complexity of description logics ,",
    "see , e.g. ,  @xcite . for the complexity of modal logic with other restrictions on the set of operators ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the approach we take in the present paper is to generalize the occurring propositional operators in the formulas . instead of the operators @xmath4 and negation , we allow the appearing operators to represent arbitrary boolean functions . in particular , there are an infinite number of boolean operators .",
    "we completely classify the complexity of modal satisfiability for every finite set of propositional operators .",
    "the restriction on the propositional operators leads to a classification following the structure of post s lattice @xcite , a tool that has been applied in similar contexts before : for propositional logic , lewis showed that the satisfiability problem is dichotomic : depending on the set of operators , propositional satisfiability is either @xmath2-complete or solvable in polynomial time @xcite . for modal satisfiability",
    ", we achieve a trichotomy : for the modal logic @xmath5 , the satisfiability problem is @xmath0-complete , @xmath1@xmath2-complete , or in @xmath3 .",
    "we also achieve a full classification for the logic @xmath6  ( in this case , we show a @xmath0/@xmath3-dichotomy ) , and almost complete classifications for the logics @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "when considering sets of operations which do not include negation , the complexity for the cases where one modal operator is allowed sometimes differs from the case where we allow both operator @xmath10 and its dual operator @xmath11 . with only one of these , modal satisfiability is @xmath0-complete exactly in those cases in which propositional satisfiability is @xmath2-complete .",
    "when we allow both modal operators , the jump to @xmath0-completeness happens earlier , i.e. , with a set of operations with less expressive power .",
    "we consider several generalizations of the problems outlined above .",
    "in particular , we introduce _ modal circuits _ as a succinct way of representing modal formulas .",
    "we show that this does not give us a significantly different complexity than the formula case .",
    "we also consider multi - modal logics , in which several independant modal operators are introduced .",
    "in addition to the satisfiability problem , we also study the validity problem , where we do not ask whether a formula is satisfiable , but whether it is true in every possible model .",
    "since our restricted modal languages do not always include negation , the complexity of this problem turns out to be different from , but related to , the complexity of the satisfiability problem .    an interesting case in our classifications is the case where we only allow the propositional exclusive - or and constants as propositional operators . for purely propositional logics ,",
    "it is very easy to see that satisfiability for these formulas ( essentially linear equations over gf(2 ) ) can be decided in polynomial time . in the case of modal logics ,",
    "an analogous result holds , but the proof requires significantly more work . as in the propositional case , it yields an optimal solution to the _ minimization problem _ as well : given a modal formula or modal circuit using only these propositional operators , we can efficiently compute an equivalent formula or circuit of minimal size .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section  [ section : preliminaries ] , we introduce the necessary definitions , recall results from the literature , and prove some basic facts about our problems .",
    "section  [ section : satisfiability ] contains our main results : the complete classification of the complexity of the modal satisfiability problem for every possible set of boolean operators . in section  [ section : validity ]",
    "we prove a relationship between satisfiability and validity implying a full classification of this problem as well .",
    "we conclude in section  [ section : conclusion ] with some open questions for future research .",
    "modal logic is an extension of classical propositional logic that talks about `` possible worlds . ''",
    "we first introduce the usual uni - modal logic , and then generalize it to the multi - modal case .",
    "uni - modal logics enrich the vocabulary of propositional logic with an additional unary modal operator @xmath12 a model for a given formula consists of a directed graph with propositional assignments . to be more precise , a _ frame _ consists of a set @xmath13 of `` worlds , '' and a `` successor '' relation @xmath14 . for @xmath15",
    ", we say @xmath16 is a _",
    "successor _ of @xmath17 .",
    "a _ model _",
    "@xmath18 consists of a frame @xmath19 , a set @xmath20 of propositional variables , and a function @xmath21 the intuition is that for @xmath22 @xmath23 denotes the set of worlds in which the variable @xmath24 is true .",
    "the operator @xmath11 is the dual operator to @xmath25 @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 .",
    "intuitively , @xmath28 means `` there is a successor world in which @xmath29 holds , '' and @xmath26 means `` @xmath29 holds in all successor worlds . '' for a class @xmath30 of frames , we say a model @xmath18 is an @xmath30-model if the underlying frame is an element of @xmath30 .    in multi - modal logic ,",
    "a finite number of these modal operators is considered , where each operator @xmath31 corresponds to an individual successor relation @xmath32 for a modal logic with @xmath33 modalities , a frame again consists of a set @xmath13 of worlds , and successor relations @xmath34 if @xmath35 we say that @xmath16 is a _",
    "@xmath36-successor _ of @xmath37 for a formula @xmath29 built over the variables @xmath38 propositional operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the unary modal operators @xmath41 we define what `` @xmath29 holds at world @xmath17 '' means for a model @xmath18 ( or @xmath42 _ satisfies _",
    "@xmath29 ) with assignment function @xmath43 written as @xmath44 .    *",
    "if @xmath29 is a propositional variable @xmath45 then @xmath44 if and only if @xmath46 , * @xmath47 if and only if ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , * @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 , * for @xmath52 , @xmath53 if and only if there is a world @xmath54 such that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "analogously to the unimodal case , the operator @xmath57 is defined as @xmath58 . for a class @xmath59 of frames ,",
    "we say a formula @xmath29 is @xmath59-satisfiable if there exists an @xmath30-model @xmath60 and a world @xmath61 such that @xmath44 . for modal formulas @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath62 we write @xmath63 if for every world in every @xmath30-model , @xmath29 holds if and only if @xmath64 holds .",
    "note that a formula @xmath29 is @xmath30-satisfiable iff @xmath65 .",
    "similarly , we say that @xmath29 is an @xmath30-tautology if @xmath66 , and finally @xmath29 is @xmath30-constant if @xmath67 or @xmath66 .",
    ".classes of frames [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     this concludes the induction , and therefore the proof .",
    "we completely classified the complexity of the modal satisfiability and validity problems arising when restricting the allowed propositional operators in the formula for the logics @xmath5  and @xmath6 .",
    "we showed that the more succinct representation of modal formulas as circuits does not have an effect on the complexity of these problems up to @xmath68-degree .",
    "we also showed that for multi - modal logics , the results only depend on whether we have @xmath69 , @xmath70 , or @xmath71 modalities , adding more modal operators does not increase the complexity of the problems we studied . note that in many cases",
    ", our results hold for more general classes of frames , as often , they are stated for any class containing the reflexive singleton , or similar conditions .",
    "this does not only apply to most of our polynomial - time results , but also for our circuit - to - formula construction in corollary  [ corollary : circuit - to - formula ] , and our implementation results in theorem  [ theorem : s11 implementation ] and the uni - modal version of theorem  [ theorem : s1 implementation ] .",
    "the most obvious next question to look at is to complete our complexity classification for other classes of frames . for @xmath72 , our proofs",
    "already give a complete classification with the exception of the complexity of the problems @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75}}\\in{\\ensuremath\\left\\{{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{l}}}}_0,{\\ensuremath{{\\mathrm{l}}}}_1\\right\\}}$ ] .",
    "we conjecture that these cases are solvable in polynomial time as well , however , to solve these cases different ideas from the ones used in the proof for @xmath5  and @xmath6  are required .",
    "another interesting question is the exact complexity of our polynomial cases , most notably the case where the propositional operators represent linear functions .",
    "there are many other interesting directions for future research .",
    "for example , one can look at other decision problems ( e.g. , global satisfiability and formula minimization ) , and one can try to generalize modal logic modally as well as propositionally .",
