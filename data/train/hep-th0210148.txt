    "since t hooft introduced an idea @xcite of the correspondence between the large @xmath5 gauge theory with certain string theory , many dualities had been discussed with this idea .",
    "one example of these dualities is the relation between chern - simons gauge theory and a - type topological strings @xcite .",
    "this duality between the topological theories can be embedded in type iia / iib superstring @xcite .",
    "the discussion for type iib superstrings was extended in @xcite .",
    "the equivalence of effective superpotential for @xmath6 gauge theory with that of type iib superstring theory on calabi - yau manifold with fluxes @xcite was proved in @xcite .",
    "recently dijkgraaf and vafa conjectured the correspondence between @xmath6 gauge theories with matrix models based on the reduction of b - type topological string theory with b - branes @xcite .",
    "they proposed the effective superpotentials for a large class of @xmath0 super yang - mills theories are computed from matrix models @xcite .",
    "in particular the effective superpotentials for the gauge theories are given by the genus zero free energies which are the summations of planar diagrams in matrix models .",
    "this perturbative sum of planar diagrams turns out to be a nonperturbative sum over fractional instantons in the @xmath6 gauge theory .",
    "for @xmath7 theory they found the coincidence with those of field theory results . in @xcite",
    "dijkgraaf - vafa s proposal was tested further for a family of deformations of @xmath8 super yang - mills theory involving an arbitrary polynomial superpotential for one of the three adjoint chiral superfields .",
    "it is important to check this proposal for @xmath6 super yang - mills theory which is the deformed @xmath9 super yang - mills theory by the superpotential for adjoint chiral superfields .",
    "in particular the models with cubic and quartic superpotentials are quite interesting , because the matrix model corresponding to these potentials have been studied well and the effective superpotential for the gauge theory was explicitly computed up to fourth order in glueball superfields from the dual closed string theory on calabi - yau manifold with rr fluxes @xcite .",
    "therefore these models are appropriate for the check of the dijkgraaf - vafa conjecture for @xmath0 theories .    the elegant proof of this correspondence for @xmath6 super yang - mills theory is given in @xcite .",
    "it is also very important to find the effective superpotential directly for this case and check this correspondence explicitly . in this note",
    "we explicitly compute the effective superpotentials for @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge theories with cubic / quartic tree level superpotentials around the classical vacuum @xmath2 in the context of matrix model and the context of calabi - yau manifold with fluxes .",
