    "most properties of dust , including light extinction , electron photoemission , and chemical activity depend not only on grain chemical composition , but also on their sizes . in astrophysical environments ,",
    "grain size is affected by grain - grain collisions , which depends on their relative velocities .",
    "the minimal velocity of grains corresponds to their thermal velocity at the ambient gas temperature arising from brownian motions .",
    "these velocities are usually assumed in the models of dust coagulation ( ossenkopf 1993 ; dominik & dullemond 2008 ) .",
    "it has been long known that large scale hydrodynamic motions associated with turbulence can make grains move faster ( see draine 1985 ) , but detailed calculations applicable to astrophysical environments started to appear only a few years ago .",
    "since most astrophysical media are magnetized and grains are charged , the hydrodynamic treatment of acceleration is not adequate . a proper treatment of the grain acceleration through the resonant interactions of charged grains with magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence has been developed relatively recently ( lazarian & yan 2002 ; yan & lazarian 2003 ; yan et al . 2004 ; yan 2009 ; hoang et al . 2011b ) .",
    "this treatment makes an extensive use of the advances in the theory / numerical studies of compressible mhd turbulence ( see cho & lazarian 2003 ; kowal & lazarian 2010 and ref . therein ) and provides the mathematical formalism of the second - order fermi acceleration of charged grains interacting with mhd turbulence .",
    "the acceleration due to the resonant interactions of mhd turbulence with charged grains decreases with decreasing grain size",
    ". such decrease arises from the fact that the larmor radius of charged grains becomes smaller as the grain mass decreases , and correspondingly , grains have to interact with smaller and less powerful turbulent fluctuations .",
    "in addition , compressible fluctuations ( i.e. , fast modes ) , which were identified in yan & lazarian ( 2003 ) as the most efficient source of acceleration , get suppressed at small scales due to plasma viscous damping , while the alfvnic mode gets inefficient for acceleration at the small scales due to anisotropy ( see yan & lazarian 2003 for more discussion ) . the resonant acceleration for grains with sizes",

    "these conclusions were also confirmed by hoang et al .",
    "( 2011b ) who considered the non - linear effects of resonant acceleration ( yan & lazarian 2008 ) and the transit time damping acceleration ( ttd ) of charged grains .",
    "a new mechanism of astrophysical grain acceleration was sketched in ivlev et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , where rough estimates of grain velocities arising from charge fluctuations in the ism were provided .",
    "the study employed fokker - planck equation and assumed that ( 1 ) charge fluctuations are fast , i.e. , the relaxation timescale for charge fluctuations is much shorter than the gaseous damping time and the larmor precession period , and ( 2 ) charge fluctuations have small amplitude ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) such that these fluctuations can be approximated as being continuous and modeled by a gaussian distribution .",
    "these assumptions are usually not realistic for very small grains for which the charge fluctuations are substantial .",
    "therefore , the unrealistically high velocities of very small grains were obtained .",
    "this motivates our present study which is intended to determining the actual velocities of pahs in typical astrophysical conditions .    in this paper",

    "we can see that the fp approach predicts much larger grain velocities than the actual values from mc simulations .",
    "the difference in grain velocities from the two approaches decreases when @xmath31 increases and becomes negligible for sufficient large grains .",
    "the reason for that the fp approach predicts unrealistically high velocities for pahs is the following .",
    "when adopting the fp approach to estimate grain velocities , we are implicitly assuming an unrealistic situation in which pahs have fast fluctuating charges with large amplitude .",
    "it corresponds to the situation in which each pah is subject to unusually strong and fast fluctuating electric fields . as a result ,",
    "pahs gain a substantial amount of energy after a short interval of time and are accelerated to extremely high velocities . however , for very small grains ( e.g. , pahs ) , we showed in figures 1 and 2 that the grain charge indeed has large dispersion , but it fluctuates rather slowly , which makes the acceleration much less efficient than the prediction by the fp equation .    for highly ionized media ,",
    "the fast charge fluctuations can be applied , but we found that the results are still much lower than the fp theoretical prediction .",
    "such a difference can arise mainly from the fact that the plasma screening effect is disregarded in the estimate of ivlev et al .",

    "grain acceleration by hydrodrag ( see draine 1985 ) was discussed as the dominant mechanism driving grain motions in the ism as well as in protoplanetary disks .",
    "recently , thanks to significant progresses in understanding of mhd turbulence , lazarian & yan ( 2003 ) , yld04 , and yan ( 2009 ) identified the gyro - resonant interactions of grains with fast modes in mhd turbulence as the dominant mechanisms to accelerate large grains ( @xmath156 cm ) to super - alfvenic velocities .",
    "for very small grains ( e.g. , pahs and nanoparticles ) , the gyro - resonance acceleration is inefficient for most phases of the ism , because pahs and nanoparticles with smaller gyro radii only resonantly interact with small scale and weak fluctuations .",
    "hoang et al . ( 2011b ) revisited the treatment of gyroresonance acceleration by mhd turbulence by accounting for the fluctuations of the grain guiding center with respect to the mean magnetic field .",

    "the combination of mc simulations for charge fluctuations with direct simulations of electrostatic interactions between grains with fluctuating charge allows us to follow the evolution of grain velocities in time and estimate their terminal velocities .",

    "such overestimate of the fp approach arises because the charge fluctuations of very small grains in the ism are slow , in contrast to the assumption of fast charge fluctuations assumed in the fp treatment , which makes electric fields fluctuating rather slowly .",
    "in addition , the fp treatment disregarded the screening effect of plasma . in the ism ,",
    "the mean separation between two grains is comparable to the debye length .",

    "below , we show that charge fluctuations can induce very small grains to overcome the coulomb barrier assuming that ppds have a sufficiently high degree of ionization for which the charge fluctuations are important .    assuming",
