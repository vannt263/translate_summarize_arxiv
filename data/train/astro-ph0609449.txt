    "the value of large scale digital sky surveys to studies of galactic structure and the local group has become abundantly clear in recent years , and particularly in the last few months .",
    "in addition to the large scale features attributed to past galaxy accretion events @xcite , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data were used to detect the remarkably strong tidal tails of palomar 5 @xcite , ngc 5466 @xcite , and streams due to extant or extinct globular clusters @xcite and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite recently used sdss data to discover several new dwarf satellites of the milky way .    in this paper",
    "we continue our analysis of the sdss database to search for extended structures in the galactic halo .",
    "we briefly describe our analysis in section [ analysis ] .",
    "we discuss the structure of a stream complex , attributed to the monoceros ring by @xcite in section [ discussion ] , estimate distances in section [ distance ] , and put constraints on the orbit in section [ orbit ] .",
    "data comprising @xmath5 photometry for stars in the region @xmath6 and @xmath7 were extracted from data release 5 of the sdss using the sdss casjobs query system .",
    "the data were analyzed using the matched filter technique employed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and described in detail by @xcite .",
    "this technique is made necessary by the fact that , over the magnitude range and over the region of sky we are considering , the foreground disk stars outnumber the more distant stars in the galactic halo by some three orders of magnitude .",
    "applied in the color - magnitude domain , the matched filter is a means by which we can optimally differentiate between two populations .",
    "we used the sdss photometry to create a color - magnitude density or hess diagram for both stars of interest and for the foreground population . dividing the former by the latter",
    ", we generated an array of relative weights which we used as an optimal color - magnitude filter .",
    "we generated the search filter using the color - magnitude distribution of stars in m 13 .",
    "owing to m 13 s proximity , we have a better measure of its luminosity function and the effects of sdss completeness than we do for other objects in the dr5 field .",
    "we used all stars with @xmath8 .",
    "we dereddended the sdss photometry as a function of position on the sky using the dirbe / iras dust maps of @xcite .",
    "a single hess diagram for field stars was generated using @xmath9 stars spread over @xmath10 deg@xmath11 of dr5 .",
    "we applied the m 13 filter to the entire survey area , and the resulting weighted star counts were summed by location on the sky to produce a two dimensional probability map .    in figure 1",
    "we show the final filtered star count distribution , using a filter matched to the @xmath12 color magnitude distribution of stars in m 13 but shifted faintwards by 0.3 mags .",
    "an exponential surface function has been subtracted from the image to remove the rapid rise in the number of disk stars at low galactic latitudes , and a 4th - order polynomial surface has been used to remove remaining large scale gradients .",
    "the final image has been binned to a pixel size of @xmath13 and smoothed using a gaussian kernel with @xmath14 .",
    "apparent in figure 1 is a broad and complex stream running from north to south across the field .",
    "portions of this stream are visible in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the narrow , curved stream running towards the northeast is part of the 63@xmath15-long globular cluster stream found by @xcite , hereafter referred to as gd-1 . the broad , east - west stream just above the main gap in the data is the sagittarius stream discussed by @xcite , though somewhat muted by our filtering due to its greater distance .",
    "the stream complex of interest extends from ( r.a . ,",
    "decl . ) = ( @xmath16 ) to ( r.a .",
    "= ( @xmath17 ) , and runs in a @xmath0 , nearly great circle path from ursa major in the north to hydra in the south .",
    "the stream is truncated at both the southern and northern ends by the limits of the available data .",
    "we note that there is also an apparent concentration of stars at ( r.a .",
    "= ( @xmath18 ) , surrounded by faint , banded substructure roughly parallel to that of the main western stream .    from the reddening map of @xcite ,",
    "the maximum values of @xmath19 are @xmath20 ( near the northern tip ) , with typical values near 0.03 along the remainder of the stream .",
    "there are diminutions here and there in the stream that could be attributed to regions of higher reddening , but there are no long features with a north - south orientation which could be held to account for either the appearance of the stream as a whole , or for the different components within it .    sampling at several representative points , the main stream complex appears to be about @xmath21 wide on average .",
    "this is significantly broader than the globular cluster streams found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 corresponds to about 800 pc at our estimated distance to the stream ( see below ) , which is much larger than the tidal diameters of globular clusters .",
    "we conclude that the progenitor was considerably more extended than a globular cluster and was most likely a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the stream is clearly not just a broad swath of stars .",
    "rather , it appears to be made up of a @xmath22 wide broad component running roughly along the center of the stream complex , and at least two narrower , @xmath23-wide streams to the east and west of the broad component . the fine structure in the stream complex is illustrated in figure 2 , where we have made several east - west slices across the complex at various declinations .",
    "comparing figures 1 and 2 , there are indications of additional structure within the broad component , and still other , more tenuous parallel streams to the east and west of the three major components .    integrating the background subtracted , weighted star counts along the stream over a width of @xmath24 we find that the total number of stars in the discernible stream down to @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "the mean surface density of stars in the southern portion of the stream ( @xmath27 ) is about 67 stars deg@xmath28 , which is roughly twice the 32 stars deg@xmath28 ( corrected for @xmath29 ) found in the northern section ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the highest local surface densities exceed 200 stars deg@xmath28 .",
    "if we assume a globular cluster - like luminosity function in the stream , then we can use the color transformation equations of @xcite , the deep m 4 luminosity function of @xcite , and the mass - luminosity relation of @xcite to extrapolate to fainter magnitudes . integrating over @xmath31",
    ", we estimate a total number of stars in the visible portion of the stream of @xmath32 , a total luminosity of @xmath33 , and a total estimated mass of @xmath34 .",
    "[ [ color - magnitude - distribution - and - distance - to - the - stream - distance ] ] color - magnitude distribution and distance to the stream [ distance ] ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    in figure 3 we show @xmath12 color - magnitude distributions for the stream stars , extracted by generating a hess diagrams of stars lying along @xmath35-wide regions covering the western and eastern halves of the stream complex and subtracting a similar field star distribution sampled over @xmath36 deg@xmath11 to the east and west of the stream complex . despite the somewhat limited statistics , a clear signature of the turn - off and main sequence is evident in the stream population .",
    "moreover , the turn - off regions of the distributions match the dereddened , shifted main sequence locus of m 13 fairly well .",
    "the turn - offs in the eastern and western halves of the complex lie at dereddened @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . a similar diagram in @xmath39 yields dereddened turn - off colors of @xmath40 and 0.25 , respectively , with the difference",
    "most likely a due to @xmath41 mag measurement uncertainty .",
    "these estimates lie between values of 0.26 and 0.22 measured by @xcite for the monoceros ring and the sagittarius stream , respectively .",
    "they are also much bluer than @xcite s estimate of dereddened @xmath42 for thick disk stars . based solely on turn - off color",
    ", we can therefore rule out association of the stream complex with thick disk stars .",
    "however , within the uncertainties , the turn - off colors are consistent with those of either the monoceros ring or the sagittarius stream .",
    "varying the magnitude shift applied to m 13 s main sequence locus from -1.0 to + 3.0 mag , we measured the foreground - subtracted , mean surface density of stream stars in the regions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . to avoid potential problems related to a difference in age between m 13 and the stream stars",
    ", we used only the portion of the filter with @xmath46 , where the bright cutoff is 0.8 mag below m 13 s main sequence turn - off .",
    "though this reduces the stream contrast somewhat , it provides sufficient integrated signal - to - noise to enable main sequence fitting .",
    "fitting gaussians to the mean surface densities as a function of magnitude shift ( e.g. @xcite , we find that the highest contrasts occur for shifts of + 0.31 , + 0.29 , and + 0.37 mag for the eastern half of the stream complex over the declination ranges given above , respectively . for the western half , we find that the filter response peaks at shifts of + 0.34 , + 0.25 , and + 0.38 mag , respectively .",
    "the magnitude shifts for the two halves are highly consistent with one another , and we conclude that there is no significant distance offset from one side of the complex to the other . adopting a distance to m 13 of 7.7 kpc @xcite we find an average heliocentric distance of @xmath47 kpc .",
    "the stream is roughly perpendicular to our line of sight and slightly curved about the galactic center as expected .",
    "our distance estimate is in excellent agreement with the @xmath48 kpc found by @xcite in their wfs-0801 field , which is situated on the western edge of the stream complex at @xmath49 .",
    "the visible portion of the stream complex spans the galactic anticenter direction and , projecting a great circle path , is inclined by @xmath50 to the galactic plane . though we are currently limited by a lack of velocity information , for a given model of the galactic potential the progenitor s orbit",
    "is actually fairly well constrained by the observed distance and orientation of the stream . using the galactic model of @xcite ( which includes a disk , bulge , and spherical halo , and which @xcite and @xcite found to work reasonably well for ngc 5466 , pal 5 , and gd-1 ) , we use a least squares method to fit both the orientation on the sky and the distance measurements in section [ distance ] .",
    "in addition to a number of normal points lying along the central component of the stream , we chose as a velocity fiducial point a position at the northern end of the stream at ( r.a .",
    ", decl ) = ( 125.463 , 51.492 ) .",
    "if we allow the proper motions to be free ranging and uninteresting parameters , the model which best fits the data predicts @xmath51 km s@xmath4 at the fiducial point , where the uncertainty corresponds to the 95% confidence interval . a projection of this orbit is labeled c in figure 4 .",
    "we note that the uncertainty is primarily determined by the large lever arm over which it has been possible to measure relative distances .",
    "the 95% range in @xmath52 in turn predicts a range in perigalactic and apogalactic radii of @xmath53 kpc and @xmath54 kpc .",
    "of course , these ranges do not take into account uncertainties in the absolute distance of the stream ( which depends on the uncertainty in m 13 s distance ) or of the validity of @xcite s galactic model .",
    "given the very similar distances estimated for the eastern and western portions of the stream , it is highly unlikely that the complex could be a superposition of multiple wraps around the galaxy .",
    "the two narrower streams ( e and w in figure 4 ) can be reasonably well modeled by 0.18 @xmath55 yr@xmath4 offsets in east - west proper motion . at the distance of the stream complex",
    "this amounts to @xmath3 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the entire stream complex is therefore likely to be the remains of a dwarf galaxy which contained distinct components spanning a range of binding energies .",
    "the narrower streams might , for example , be the remnants of the parent galaxy s globular cluster population .",
    "piecing together the original structure and evolution of the stream s progenitor will require detailed n - body modeling .",
    "integrating orbits for parameter sets spanning the range above , we find that , with the exception of the sagittarius de , there are no known dwarf galaxies within @xmath21 of the projected orbit .",
    "the sagittarius de lies @xmath56 from the projection of the best - fit orbit , but the orbital planes of the the sagittarius de and the new stream are clearly distinct ( figure 4 ) ; we attribute this apparent proximity to the expected confluence of orbit projections in the direction of the galactic center and not to any physical association between them .",
    "the orientation of the stream on the sky puts fairly strict limits on the plane of the orbit .",
    "the visible portion of the stream passes through lynx , cancer , and hydra .",
    "we find no reasonable combination of parameters that would place the southern projection of the stream in either monoceros or canis major . nor does the visible extent of the stream complex fit either the prograde or retrograde models of the monoceros stream computed by @xcite .",
    "thus , even while the turn - off colors appear to be similar , we conclude on orbital grounds that this stream complex is unlikely to be related to either the monoceros stream or the canis major overdensity .",
