    "in the 1d peierls system , we have a parabolic band of noninteracting particles in a periodic external potential that disperses as @xmath13 ( in ry units ) and has a particular fermi vector @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the chemical potential .",
    "one assumes that the band is half filled so that the first reciprocal lattice vector @xmath16 peierls was the first to point out that such a system is formally unstable against any doubling of the unit cell , because it creates an additional potential with a non - zero component at @xmath17 @xmath18 and opens a gap .",
    "he emphasized that a gain in the one - electron energy depends on the amplitude of lattice distortion logarithmically ( as @xmath19 while the elastic energy is normally quadratic , and therefore the ground state would always correspond to a nonzero distortion .",
    "it appears that actual numerical calculations do not necessarily find a distortion @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite argue that when the electronic susceptibility is nonanalytic , the elastic energy may be as well and therefore it is not guaranteed that for an infinitesimal distortion , the one - electron energy will be larger .",
    "this same point can be argued as an inability to cleanly partition the total energy into the one - electron energy and the elastic energy in a real system , where the particles in question are interacting electrons .",
    "instead , the full expression for the total energy ( in density functional theory , for instance ) must be analyzed .",
    "following ref . , we can write , using implicit matrix notation ( in real or reciprocal space ) the change of energy arising from the nuclear displacement in terms of the change of the potential of the nuclei , @xmath20 , and the induced density change , @xmath21 , as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total dft interaction , including the coulomb and exchange - correlation kernel .",
    "note that we use a sign convention such that in a stable system @xmath24 neglecting the matrix character of these equations , we immediately observe that a divergence in @xmath25 as found by peierls , is by itself insufficient to cause an instability , since the total susceptibility is bounded by @xmath26 and does not diverge .",
    "this is not necessarily true if the matrix character ( or local fields ) is taken into account and such an inclusion results in a complicated formula for the phonon frequencies , known as the pick - cohen - martin formula as discussed in ref . .",
    "however , without these considerations , this result demonstrates that there is no direct relation between the peierls instability in a system of noninteracting particles and cdws in real systems .",
    "the same point can be made using a linear response approach @xcite : an interacting half - filled electronic system is stable against infinitesimal perturbation",
    ". only a finite distortion , and only if e - ph coupling is larger than a critical value , can be stable .",
    "this is already a very serious reservation , but nonetheless it is instructive to step back and investigate the classical  peierls instability in a noninteracting system .",
    "there is no question that the susceptibility of this system is logarithmically divergent , but there are interesting , and important questions left to ask .",
    "first , is this divergency robust with respect to small deviations from a perfect nesting , as is always the case in real materials ?",
    "second , where is the energy gain associated with this instability collected ? that is , can electrons away from the fermi surface be effectively neglected or must the effects of lower filled states be taken into account",
    "?    the standard expression for the real part of susceptibility reads @xmath27 this expression is normalized to @xmath28 at @xmath29 ( the overall scale is not important at the moment ) and has a very weak , logarithmic divergency at @xmath30 to illustrate just how weak it is , we assume a relaxation rate @xmath31 corresponding to the drude relaxation rate in optics , and recalculate @xmath32 .",
    "the new result reads : @xmath33 the divergency has been reduced to merely an enhancement of @xmath34 over @xmath35 by a factor of @xmath36 for typical @xmath37 of the order of 0.1 - 0.2 ev this enhancement is by a factor of 2 - 2.5 .",
    "one can also add that at any finite temperature , even without relaxation , @xmath38 for typical fermi energies and t=10k ( most observed ilts occur at higher temperatures ) the enhancement is again only a factor of the order of four .",
    "thus , carrier scattering and fermi function broadening are suffucient to reduce the nesting - induced divergency to a minor structure in @xmath39 but an even more severe effect is caused by geometrical deviations of the fermi surface from perfect nesting .",
    "a common procedure in the search for nesting vectors in a particular fermiology is to copy a quasi-2d fermi surface cut onto transparent paper and slide it until some piece of the displaced fermi surface visually coincides with another piece of the original plot .",
    "it is instructive to give a quantitative gauge of what constitutes a `` good nesting '' vs. a `` bad nesting '' .",
    "assuming that the nested  parts really nest only up to some @xmath40 in the reciprocal space , we observe , by averaging eq.[ideal ] , that @xmath41    in the small @xmath40 limit , @xmath42.$ ] in other words , if 2d fermi lines coincide within 5% of the fermi vector , the corresponding enhancement of the susceptibility is about a factor of three .",
    "it is also important to remember that real materials are _ quasi_-2d , not 2d .",
    "any dispersion in the third direction of the order of @xmath40 brings us again to eq.[2d ] . in a one - band case one",
    "can estimate the ratio @xmath43 as @xmath44 this shows that anything with a calculated transport anisotropy of less than one order of magnitude is 3d from a nesting point of view .",
    "fig.[decrease ] illustrates the effect of various deviations from the perfect peierls picture on the divergence of @xmath45 .    to further emphasize the non - role that fs nesting plays , let us investigate a system in which an ilt with @xmath46 has actually occurred , and as a result a gap equal to @xmath47 has opened , with the corresponding energy gain in the one - electron energy .",
    "the common wisdom is that energy is gained predominantly near the former fermi energy , where the lowering of one - electron states is the largest .",
    "but , is this really so ? in first order perturbation theory ,",
    "the new one - electron spectrum is @xmath48^{2}+4v^{2}}}{2 } , \\\\",
    "\\delta e_{k } & = & e_{k}-e_{k}^{\\prime } = \\frac{\\delta e_{k}+\\sqrt{\\delta e_{k}{}^{2}+4v^{2}}}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the energy shift of the state @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the energy difference between the two states connected by the nesting vector @xmath52 an inspection of this expression shows that integrating it over @xmath53 does not diverge at @xmath54 ( that is , at the fermi energy ) , but would diverge at large energies , @xmath55 , if the integration were not limited by the bandwidth .",
    "substituting @xmath56 we get @xmath57 the total energy gain , @xmath58 is :    @xmath59 .\\ ] ]    the first term corresponds to integrating over the region @xmath60 and neglecting @xmath61 and the second corresponds to integrating over the region @xmath62 and neglecting terms smaller than @xmath63 in other words , the first ( non - divergent ) term comes from states near the fermi level , where the gap opens up , and the second term ( divergent at large @xmath64 ) comes from the rest of the states below the fermi level and down to the bottom of the band .",
    "since an actual instability is always a competition between an electronic ( in this picture , one - electron ) energy gain and an elastic energy loss , it is apparently more important to optimize the energy gain from all occupied states than to open a gap over the largest possible part of the fermi surface .",
    "since , as we have just found , all occupied states are important for a ilt , it is important to keep in mind the multiband character of real solids , and , correspondingly , the contribution of the interband transitions to @xmath65 to get a feeling for the interband effects , let us consider an insulating system which , instead of the free - electron band discussed above , has a fully occupied first neighbor tight - binding band , @xmath66 separated from a similar empty band by an energy @xmath67 , @xmath68 let us assume for simplicity a constant interband dipole matrix element equal to unity . the susceptibility is given by @xmath69 this susceptibility is enhanced at @xmath70 ( at the edge of the bz ) compared to its minimum value ( at @xmath71 by a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "this enhancement can be very large even for bands with a large relative shift .",
    "using for example @xmath73 ( giving a gap of 1/8 of the bandwidth ) , the enhancement is 2.2 , quite comparable to what one might expect in a realistic nesting scenario .",
    "this demonstrates again that the fermi surface topology is unlikely to be a factor in cdw formation .",
    "note that the band structure that we have used is not special in any way , as opposed to the half - filled band exhibiting a peierls instability .",
    "in the following sections , we present three examples of real materials , commonly thought to be canonical examples of nesting - driven cdw systems : nbse@xmath0 , tase@xmath0 , and cete@xmath1 . using first principles density functional theory calculations , we show that fs nesting is not the driving force behind the observed cdw in any of the three compounds .",
    "we additionally investigate a chain of na ions and show that even for this artificially perfect 1d system , the strong fs nesting fails to produce any appreciable cdw when the ionic positions are fixed .",
    "this is perfectly in line with our contention that electron - phonon coupling is necessary to instigate the ilt and that even in the peierls formulation , the resulting cdw is exponentially small .    for all investigated compounds",
    ", the first principles calculations were performed using the well - known wien2k package@xcite with the local density approximation ( lda ) to the exchange correlation potential @xcite . for nbse@xmath0 and tase@xmath0 , it was found that spin - orbit coupling has a finite effect on the band structure and fermi surface and therefore was taken into account . to get a good energy mesh , we calculated eigenvalues at nearly 15,000 @xmath74 points in the full bz . for cete@xmath1 ,",
    "the partially filled @xmath75-states pose a well - known problem for the mean - field lda methodology by partially filling each of the @xmath76 states rather than completely filling some and emptying all others .",
    "we have addressed this shortcoming by using lda+u in the fully localized limit scheme @xcite .",
    "we applied a u of 4.5 ev and successfully reproduced the @xmath77 state observed by magnetization measurements @xcite for the ce ion , simultaneously removing all @xmath76 bands from the fermi energy .",
    "none of the quantities we calculate are expected to be sensitive to the precise value of u and we did not investigate the effects of changing it .",
    "we used a mesh of approximately 30,000 @xmath74 points in the full bz to calculate the energy eigenvalues used for the susceptibilities .",
    "for all compounds , we used a temperature smearing of 2 mry during numerical integration .",
    "for calculation of the chain of na atoms we used the vienna ab - initio simulation ( vasp ) package with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) basis set @xcite .",
    "we used several different pseudopotentials with varying levels of hardness for the na core , all giving identical results to within the accuracy of our calculations .",
    "quasi - two - dimensional nbse@xmath0 belongs to a family of layered dichalcogenides that undergoes a cdw transition sometimes thought to be related to fs nesting .",
    "a calculation of both the real and imaginary parts of the one - electron susceptibility @xcite shows this to be unequivocally not the case .",
    "although fs nesting does exist and does produce a peak in @xmath78 , it is located at * @xmath79 * = ( 1/3,1/3,0 ) and not at the observed @xmath80 = ( 1/3,0,0 ) ( see ref for pictures ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a weak peak at @xmath81 appears in @xmath10 .",
    "this peak is not strong enough alone to stimulate the observed cdw transition , but must be assisted by electron - phonon coupling at the same wave vector . to verify this , we performed two first principles calculations of nbse@xmath0 in a supercell corresponding to the observed cdw vector . in one case",
    ", we clamp the ions to their high symmetry positions and in the other we allow them to shift .",
    "when allowed , the ions do indeed shift and an instability at the right wave vector , ( 1/3,0,0 ) , is reproduced . in the case where the ions are forced to be stationary , both ionic and electronic systems remain stable in their high symmetry states .",
    "even if we prompt the electronic system by artificially redistributing the charge along the known cdw direction , it relaxes back to its high symmetry state .",
    "our calculations on this system provide a clear example of the lack of influence of fermi surface nesting with respect to cdws : a strong fs nesting that produces a sharp peak _ fails _ to gives rise to a cdw at the associated wave vector , while a peak wholly unrelated to fs nesting but at the correct vector appears in the real part of the susceptibility and , in conjunction with electron - lattice effects ( but not without ! ) _ does _ produce a cdw .",
    "we have also investigated an isostructural material , tase@xmath0 , that has an observed cdw at approximately the same wave vector as nbse@xmath0 .",
    "the fermi surface of the ta compound is different from that of nbse@xmath0 , as was most recently observed by rossnagel _",
    "et al _ @xcite who also point out that the measured surface differs from the calculated one @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because calculated and observed fermi surfaces are in quite good agreement for nbse@xmath0 .",
    "one reason for the discrepancy between nbse@xmath0 and tase@xmath0 and between theory and experiment is spin - orbit coupling , which is strong for the heavy ta ion .",
    "this coupling has not been included in most previously published tase@xmath0 band structures and fermi surfaces @xcite , with the result that they differ less than they should from nbse@xmath0 band structures .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction non - trivially changes the band dispersion near the fermi energy , particularly along @xmath82 and leads to a different fermi surface topology .",
    "scalar relativistic effects are responsible for the lower se band in tase@xmath0 ( compared to nbse@xmath0 ) which removes it from the fermi surface entirely .",
    "although we include both scalar relativistic effect and spin - orbit coupling in our calculations and find qualitative differences between the nb and ta di - selenides , we still find that the tase@xmath0 fermi surface differs somewhat from the arpes observed surface .",
    "however , nearly perfect agreement can be achieved by a small shift of the fermi energy ( about 0.04 ev ) . in fig .",
    "[ tase2fs ] , the fermi surface both with and without the small shift in fermi energy is shown .",
    "the susceptibilities presented here are calculated using the fermi energy shift necessary to bring theoretical and experimental fermi surfaces into agreement , but in fact this shift has no visible effect whatsoever on either the real or imaginary parts , despite its dramatic effect on the fs topology . in fig.[tase2 ] , the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibilities for tase@xmath0 are presented .",
    "looking at the susceptibilities in fig.[tase2 ] , one can see some similarity between the peak structures in this compound and in nbse@xmath0 @xcite , most particularly in the location of the nesting - driven peak in @xmath83 vs. the peak in @xmath84 .",
    "again we find that the peaks are in different locations , indicating that nesting can not give rise to a charge instability .",
    "a recent study of these two materials @xcite concluded that both materials have cdws driven by strong electron - phonon coupling in the presence of weak nesting .",
    "our calculations show that , indeed , electron - phonon coupling is behind the transition , but we can eliminate fermi surface nesting from the phenomenon entirely . there is no nesting at all , not even weak , at the cdw wave vector . the electronic susceptibility structure , which is indeed favorable to a cdw at the right wave vector , is due to finite energy electronic transitions and not to a fermi surface geometry .",
    "cete@xmath1 is another layered material , ( see fig.[cete3struct ] ) also belonging to a family of compounds rte@xmath1 , r = rare earth , all of which exhibit cdws @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensionality is considerably stronger in this series than in the dichalcogenides discussed above , producing an easily visible fermi surface nesting between strongly two - dimensional fermi sheets . as in the former series , the strongest nesting peaks seen in @xmath83 produced by this nesting are far away from @xmath80 and do not carry over into @xmath85 .",
    "however , much weaker peaks associated with a different nesting do appear in @xmath83 at the observed cdw wave vector and are then strongly enhanced by contributions away from the fermi energy to eventually produce peaks in @xmath86 .",
    "it is an interesting and instructive exercise to track down the origin of both kinds of nesting peaks to examine why the strongest ones are irrelevant and why the weaker peaks are present throughout the energy spectrum , finally resulting in a peak in @xmath10 . to begin",
    ", we describe how the structure of the cete@xmath1 very simply gives rise to its fermi surface .",
    "cete@xmath1 is composed of two different types of layers : those containing staggered ce and te ions and those containing te ions only ( see fig.[cete3struct ] ) .",
    "the states near the fermi energy have predominantly te @xmath87 character and come from the pure te layers . assuming a nearest neighbor only tight binding model of te @xmath88 and @xmath89 orbitals ( see fig.[cete3struct]b ) in these layers with @xmath90 @xmath91 5@xmath92 as in fig.[cete3struct]b",
    ", we produce the crosshatched pattern of slightly warped one - dimensional fermi sheets shown in fig.[cete3struct]c . this model and the values of the tight - binding parameters",
    "are very similar to those developed in ref . .",
    "nearest neighbor te ions are inequivalent due to symmetry breaking imposed by the stacking of layers along the third direction .",
    "this results in a larger unit cell and a smaller , rotated bz , shown superimposed in fig.[cete3struct]c .",
    "the full , calculated fs is shown in fig.[fs ] .",
    "a very good facsimile of it is achieved by folding the quasi-1d sheets of our tb model down into the new zone .",
    "though small gaps appear during the folding down process , the long 1d ribbons are still clearly visible and both the nesting peak and the peak in @xmath10 can be traced back to these sheets .    as can be seen by the cartoons in fig.[fs ] , there is an excellent ( ideally perfect in the nearest - neighbor tb model ) fs nesting between two of the quasi-1d ribbons along the ( 110 ) direction of the bz .",
    "this produces very sharp nesting - derived peaks in @xmath93 , away from the observed nesting vector .",
    "a moderate peak at @xmath94 = @xmath80 is visible , but by far the strongest peaks are located elsewhere in the brillouin zone .",
    "any cdw directly stemming from fs nesting would occur first at wave vectors corresponding to these alternate spots rather than at the observed @xmath80 . in the real part of the susceptibility ,",
    "the strongest fs nesting peaks are suppressed dramatically , leaving only a peak at the correct wave vector ( fig.[fs ] ) .",
    "this is entirely due to an effect of the finite - energy transitions ( note the non - zero value of terms in eq .",
    "[ compsusc ] even for widely spaced eigenvalues ) that appear in the real part of susceptibility but not in the nesting function ( imaginary part ) .",
    "the reason that the bulk of the @xmath95 peak height at @xmath96 = @xmath80 comes from contributions away from the fermi energy can be understood by an examination of the band structure : the velocities of the electronic states connected by @xmath80 ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) are nearly equal and opposite at the fermi energy ( note that for the wave vector @xmath99 in fig.[fs]b , the opposite is true , @xmath100 and @xmath101 have the same sign ) .",
    "therefore nearby states @xmath102 and @xmath103 are also of equal energy and are connected by @xmath80 .",
    "these are located above and below the fermi energy respectively and do not contribute to the nesting function but do contribute to the real part of the susceptibility .",
    "this phenomenon has been pointed out earlier in ref . under the title of hidden nesting. obviously",
    ", if there are regions of the energy spectrum with equal and opposite velocities , they will contribute heavily to @xmath10 even if they are imperfectly nested at the fermi energy itself .",
    "on the other hand , strong nesting between states exactly at the fermi energy may die away quickly in other parts of the energy spectrum and contribute little to @xmath95 .",
    "this is the essence of why well nested fermi surfaces fail to produce a peak in @xmath104 not only for cete@xmath1 but also for the dichalcogenides discussed in the previous section .",
    "the fermi surface is simply too small a part of the energy range from which @xmath10 collects to have a decisive effect .",
    "to best approximate a perfect peierls system , we calculated the ground state of a chain of na ions separated by 38 @xmath105 in the two non - chain directions .",
    "the na - na distance was relaxed along the chain to its optimal value of 3.34 @xmath105 .",
    "as we saw previously with nbse@xmath0 , no cdw could be stabilized if the ions were clamped to their high symmetry positions , even though this system is ideal in every respect , _",
    "i.e. _ the electronic - only cdw is unstable even when no mitigating factors such as higher dimensionality or imperfect nesting are present .",
    "surprisingly , a relaxation of the ionic positions along the one - dimensional chain also failed to produce any deviation from the high symmetry , equally spaced arrangment , even when an initial dimerization was imposed . however , when the ions were allowed a larger dimensional freedom , the system distorted into a zigzag configuration as shown in fig . [ nachain ] .",
    "the ions in the zigzag arrangement are 3.43 @xmath105 apart and the angle formed by the distortion is 152 degrees .",
    "although this distortion doubles the unit cell and lowers the total energy , it does not create the expected gap at e@xmath106 .",
    "the coupling between matrix elements at the bz boundary ( k=@xmath107 ) that would give rise to a gapped system does not occur because the distortion is two dimensional , while the wavefunctions are one - diemnsional .",
    "thus , integration over the direction perpendicular to the chain in the dimension in which the distorion occurs drives the matrix element to zero .",
    "precisely the same result can be obtained using a tight - binding formulation .",
    "regardless of the number of neighbors included in the model , the states at the edge of the bz remain degenerate , _",
    "i.e. _ there is no gap . on the other hand",
    ", an enforced dimerization of the ions does produce a gap at e@xmath106 , but is unstable .",
    "the true origin of the two - dimensional distortion is not yet entirely clear , but the peierls mechanism can be ruled out . thus , under perfect conditions , no electronic - only cdw forms , and no electron - ion interaction assisted cdw forms either .",
    "this indicates that the peierls formulation is even weaker than we originally set out to prove .",
    "not only do small deviations from the ideal system destroy the divergence that is purported to cause cdw formation , but in the ideal case itself , where no such deviations are present , the existence of ion cores is enough to effectively nullify the peierls instability .",
    "to summarize , we have first explored the standard half - filled one - dimensional free electron system from the perspective of a peierls distortion and have shown that the divergence in the real part of the susceptibility , caused by fermi surface nesting , is exceedingly fragile .",
    "effects such as temperature , imperfect nesting , or scattering , all of which are expected to be operative in a real material , reduce the divergence to a simple peak , often not more than a factor of two or three enhanced over the baseline susceptibility at * * q**@xmath1080 .",
    "thus , expectations of a cdw transition driven entirely by a fermi surface nesting in any real material are unrealistic from the outset .",
    "next , we have examined a system in which a gap at the fermi surface has already been opened due a commensurate or incommensurate lattice transition , and found that the energy gain comes largely from the lowering of already filled states located _ away _ from the fermi energy and not from removing states from the fermi energy itself .",
    "this reinforces our contention that the fermi surface topology plays at best a secondary role in cdw formation . using first principles calculations , we take three examples of well - known cdw materials to illustrate our point and in each case we find that fermi surface nesting either does not exist at the cdw wave vector , or is not the strongest nesting in the system .",
    "we further find that the cdw instability is not fundamentally electronic , but rather stems from strong electron - phonon interaction which , of course , is itself affected by the electronic structure .. finally , we examine the canonical peierls system , a one - dimensional chain of atoms , and find that the expected dimerization along the chain axis with any realistic amplitude is energetically unfavorable .",
    "the expected doubling of the unit cell occurs only if the one - dimensionality is relaxed to allow a zigzag , rather than dimerized , distortion .",
    "we conclude that no true distinction between cdws and structural phase transitions , in particular incommensurate lattice transitions , can be made . inspecting the fermi surface itself for possible nesting features , without actually calculating the real part of electronic susceptibility",
    "has no predictive power for such structural transitions . calculating the real part of the electronic susceptibility may be helpful in analyzing such instabilities , but only in relatively few cases can it be accepted as the only or even the main driving force for such transitions ."

    "<S> the issue is even more confounded by the fact that the words nesting  and peierls transition  are also interpreted differently by different researchers . </S>",
    "<S> we use the first term in its literal sense : fermi surface parts are nested if , when shifted rigidly , they coincide with other fermi surface parts . </S>",
    "<S> some authors , appreciating the fact that this is not sufficient for a peak in @xmath4 , distinguish between real nesting  that exists not only at zero frequency , but also within some finite range of transition energies ( as we discuss later in connection with cete@xmath6 this imposes an additional constraint on the fermi velocities ) , and false nesting  that has infavorable fermi velocities . as for the second term </S>",
    "<S> , there is a tendency to use peierls transition as a synonym for dimerization ( @xmath7 dimerization in vo@xmath8 is often called a peierls transition @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> again , we adhere to a more strict definition that reserves this nomenclature for a transition driven by a lowering of one - electron band energy caused by the opening of a gap , as in the original peierls model . </S>",
    "<S> note that the doubling of the unit cell may occur via dimerization , but can also easily occur via zigzag - ing of the atomic chain or via an even more complicated pattern .    in section </S>",
    "<S> i , we consider the classical 1d peierls transition , for which the conditions listed above are fully satisfied and in which fs nesting is indeed expected to give rise to cdw formation ( the results for a nested 2d system , such as the nearest neighbor one - band tb model , are qualitatively the same ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate how fragile this construction is even in 1d , since a cdw of fully electronic origin is exponentially weak . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we will show how rather small deviations ( on the order of what is expected in real materials ) from the perfect model are sufficiently strong to suppress fs nesting - driven cdw formation . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we perform density functional calculations of several real materials that are commonly considered to be cdw systems and show that , even in these canonical systems , electron - phonon coupling and not nesting is at the heart of the cdw phenomenon . for clear understanding in both following sections , it is necessary to point out that an electronic cdw instability is not induced by a divergence in the imaginary part of susceptibility , @xmath9 which is the function that reflects the fs topology and can be easily measured experimentally by neutron scattering . instead , it is the real part , @xmath10 , which must diverge in order to trigger an electronic cdw . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , @xmath10 , is difficult to map experimentally ( see , however , ref ) . </S>",
    "<S> we write the two parts , in the constant matrix element approximation as :    @xmath11    since @xmath12 is easier to calculate , it is often presented in first - principle studies as a quantitative test of the fs nesting ( which it is ) and/or as a gauge of a tendency to cdw formation ( which it is not ) @xcite . </S>"
