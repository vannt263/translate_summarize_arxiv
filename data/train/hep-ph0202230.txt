    "in this paper we study the process @xmath5 in the presence of low - scale gravity with extra spatial dimensions .",
    "in such a large extra - dimensions scenario gravity is allowed to propagate in @xmath6 dimensions , while sm particles confine to a sub - space of 4-dimensions .",
    "this idea was proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite , and the phenomenological consequences at colliders have been looked at in various processes in detail by many authors @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to have a universally fundamental - scale , @xmath2 , of tev range where all interactions including gravity are comparable in strength .",
    "this is contrary to the traditional belief that gravity becomes comparable in stregth to the other interactions only at planck mass , @xmath7 gev .",
    "this lowering of the scale is possible if we consider @xmath8 spatial dimensions in addition to the usual 3 + 1 space - time manifold .",
    "these additional dimensions are compactified to a radius @xmath9 .",
    "relation between the two mass scales , the size of the extra dimensions and the number of extra dimensions is obtained by demanding that for distances larger than @xmath9 gravitational potential behaves like the newtonian @xmath10 .",
    "thus we get the relation@xcite @xmath11    with an @xmath12 tev , @xmath13 requires @xmath9 to be of the order of @xmath14 meters .",
    "this is ruled out , since newtonian gravity is tested to be correct up to about millimeter level . @xmath15 or larger",
    "is allowed by this criterion .",
    "thus gravity can propagate in @xmath16 dimensions as long as the extra @xmath8 dimensions are smaller than 1 mm . since standard model ( sm )",
    "interactions are tested up to sub - fermi level , we require to confine these particles to a 4 dimensional sub - space . massless gravitons propagating in the bulk",
    "is seen from the 4 dimensional sub - manifold as massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes with spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 .",
    "mass spectrum can be treated to be continuous owing to the fact that mass splitting is of the order of @xmath17 , which is about @xmath18ev in the case of @xmath15 , and of the order of mev in the case of @xmath19 .",
    "these kk modes couple to matter and gauge particles through the energy - momentum tensor and its trace .",
    "the new interactions influence collider experiments in two ways .",
    "one through the production of real kk modes , and two through the exchange of virtual kk modes in various processes . for a review on the effects of this idea in linear colliders like tesla ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will consider the process @xmath5 to study the effect of low - scale gravity at the proposed linear colliders to run at 500 gev and above .",
    "earlier studies of this process @xcite have discussed possible limits on @xmath2 obtainable measuring , mainly , deviation of the total cross section from its sm value .",
    "we will discuss , in addition to the total cross section , other observables like the forward - backward asymmetry and polarisation fraction of the @xmath20 s . in a linear collider it is possible to use polarised beams .",
    "we will discuss the benifits of beam polarisation in the present case .    in section 2",
    "we discuss the process and give the expressions for matrix elements .",
    "section 3 describes different observables that are relevant at a high energy linear collider .",
    "conclusions will be given in section 4 .",
    "the process @xmath5 has the standard interactions with the exchange of photon and @xmath21-boson in the @xmath22-channel and a @xmath23-channel with @xmath24 exchange . in the case of large extra dimensions , there are additional @xmath22-channels with spin-2 kk excitations of bulk gravitons .",
    "spin-1 modes do not couple to the sm particles , and spin-0 contributions are proportional to the mass of the fermion invovled .",
    "we treat electron as massless , and so neglect spin-0 exchange contribution .",
    "the feynman diagrams of different channels are given in fig .",
    "[ fig_fdiag ] .",
    "relevant feynman rules are derived by han , lykken and zhang @xcite , and also by guidice , _ et al _ @xcite in a linearised - gravity aproximation .",
    "there is an infinite tower of massive kk excitations all having a universal coupling to the sm particles .",
    "han , lykken and zhang @xcite have derived the propagator factor after integrating over the spectrum , cutting it at the scale @xmath2 . following them we get kk exchange contribution to the matrix element given by    @xmath25   ( \\bar v \\slash \\!\\!\\!q_1 u ) \\right .",

    "@xmath36 is the centre of masss energy of the collider , and @xmath37 is the factor corresponding to kk propagators after integrating over all the modes .",
    "the propagator factor in the limit of @xmath38 is given by @xmath39    here @xmath8 is the number of large extra dimensions . in the case of high energy colliders",
    "expected to operate at energies of 500 gev through 1 - 2 tev , @xmath38 may not be a good approximation .",
    "in that case , nonresonant part of the propagator factors , neglecting the narrow width of each kk mode , as given by @xcite are ,    @xmath40{l }       -\\sum_{k=1}^{n/2 - 1 } \\frac{1}{2k}\\left(\\frac{m_s}{\\sqrt{s}}\\right)^{2k }      -\\frac{1}{2}{\\rm log}\\left(\\frac{m_s^2}{s}-1\\right)\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ;      \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;({\\rm even}\\;\\ ; n)\\\\   -\\sum_{k=1}^{(n-1)/2 } \\frac{1}{2k-1}\\left(\\frac{m_s}{\\sqrt{s}}\\right)^{2k-1 }      + \\frac{1}{2}{\\rm log}\\left(\\frac{m_s+\\sqrt{s}}{m_s-\\sqrt{s}}\\right )      \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( { \\rm odd}\\;\\ ; n )      \\end{array }      \\right.\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    apart from these non - resonant contributions , there is also a resonant contribution to the propagator factor , which adds an imaginary part to the matrix element @xcite . in the case of @xmath5 , since the sm matrix elements are real , there is no contribution from this part in the interference term .",
    "purely gravity mediated contribution will be of order @xmath41 , and is negligible unless @xmath36 is very close to @xmath2 .",
    "explicit expressions for different helicity amplitudes are given in @xcite .",
    "we consider full propagator factor including its dependence on the number of extra dimensions , as given above .",
    "thus to compare with the expressions given in @xcite the factor @xmath42 should be replaced by @xmath43 .    in the next section",
    "we discuss various observables that could be used at a high energy linear collider .",
    "possible limits on @xmath2 that could be obtained at future linear colliders ( lc ) from considering the deviation of total cross section from the sm expectation were obtained in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "limits obtained depend on the aproximations used to obtain kk - propagator factor .",
    "our main aim in this report is to identify possible signatures which characterize the spin-2 nature of the graviton exchange .",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath20 s and the forward - backward asymmetry , as we will see , are good candidates in this respect .      we first consider typical limit on @xmath2 that one could obtain at an lc . in table",
    "[ table - mslt ] we give limits on @xmath2 that would correspond to a 2% deviation in the sm cross section at lc with c.m .",
    "energies of 500 gev and 800 gev .",
    "we assume 100% efficiency , and have not considered any experimental cuts .",
    "more realisitic considerations will change the limits somewhat .",
    "large beam polarisations can be achieved in linear colliders . using a right - polarised electron beam switches off the @xmath24 exchange contribution , and",
    "hence improves the sensitivity to graviton exchange contribution . at a 500 gev collider",
    ", while using unpolarised beams or left - polarised electron beam with unpolarised positron beam could reach @xmath2 values from about 1.3 tev ( for @xmath15 ) up to about 1.8 tev ( for @xmath19 ) , right - polarised electron beam with unpolarised positron beam could reach up to about 2.7 tev .",
    ".@xmath2 values corresponding to 2% deviation in the sm cross section at lc with @xmath1 gev and @xmath44 gev for different beam polarisations .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     although the cross section with right - handed electron polarisation is only about 57.1 ( 18.7 ) fb at @xmath1 ( 800 ) gev , a collider with luminosity of the order of 100 fb@xmath45 will produce several thousand events .",
    "this would allow a determination of @xmath46 with an error of 1 - 2 % , sufficient to probe the effects of grativon exchange indicated in table [ table - fs ] .",
    "we have considered the process @xmath5 to study the effect of a typical low energy gravity model suggested by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali @xcite . in such a model , in addition to the usual sm contribution , there is a contribution due to the spin-2 kk exchange in the @xmath22-channel .",
    "earlier studies have obtained limits on the mass scale @xmath2 , at which gravity becomes comparable in strength to the other interactions , in @xmath16 dimensions @xcite .",
    "these limits are obtained considering deviation of the total cross section from its sm value . in this paper",
    "we have considered observables which help distinguish the spin-2 nature of the interaction .",
    "a forward - backward asymmetry in the case of right - polarised electron beam is one significant observable in this regard .",
    "we have quantified the asymmetry , and considered reach of @xmath2 by looking at this asymmetry at a linear collider running at @xmath47 500 gev and 800 gev .",
    "we also looked at the polarisation fractions of the @xmath20 s produced . here again , we reach the conclusion that right - polarised electron beam is advantageous .",
    "our analysis shows that an @xmath2 of about 2.5 tev could produce detectable effects at a linear collider running at 500 gev centre of mass energy .",

    "the effects are qualitatively different from other new physics scenarios , _",
    "strong @xmath48 interactions @xcite or extra gauge boson models @xcite , since these affect the @xmath49 partial waves , while graviton exchange is specifically a @xmath50 phenomenon .",
