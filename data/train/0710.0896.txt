    "<S> we have performed experiments above and below the ordering temperature to measure how the spin excitations evolve . </S>",

    "<S> the sharp spin waves evolve into weak quasielastic spin fluctuations at the zone center ( 1,0,0 ) and strong excitations at the incommensurate positions ( 1@xmath60.4,0,0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the possibility that these incommensurate excitations may be due to magnetovibrational scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this can arise from a shifting of a the phonon excitations at ( 2,0,0 ) to ( 1@xmath60.4,0,0 ) as allowed through the neutron scattering cross - section for magnetoelastic coupling.@xcite however , with the small moment size of this system , it is improbable that such a scattering process is being observed . </S>",
    "<S> it was also originally reported@xcite that the incommensurate excitations were just quasielastic fluctuations , as constant q scans on a triple axis spectrometer resolved a peak at a finite energy of 0.6 thz = 2.5 mev and a decrease in intensity as a function of energy typical of an overdamped response . </S>",
    "<S> what was previously unknown was that the quasielastic fluctuations were only the lower limit of a band of high - velocity spin excitations that extend well above the upper limit of the sharp collective spin excitations of the ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature is increased , the ( 1,0,0 ) fluctuations decrease and the incommensurate fluctuations remain approximately constant to at least 25 k.@xcite    the implications of this discovery are : ( 1 ) the incommensurate excitations have a well - defined structure as a function of q , and thus the electrons are highly correlated _ above _ 17.5 k. this is completely unexpected for a system of localized moments in a paramagnetic state , but similar dynamics above t@xmath7   ( with the formation of paramagnons@xcite for example ) has been observed with neutron scattering experiments in other itinerant electron systems such as chromium and v@xmath0o@xmath8.@xcite , @xcite ( 2 ) the dispersion is such that the maximum group velocity is at least a factor of 2 larger than the maximum group velocity of the excitations in the ordered state . </S>",
    "<S> a significant restructuring of the fermi surface must be responsible for the hidden order state . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the gapping of these strong spin fluctuations below 17.5 k must provide a considerable portion of the entropy removal at the transition . </S>",
    "<S> these excitations have a structure in reciprocal space such that they occur at several symmetry - related wavevectors within the first brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of phase space occupied by these excitations is greater than those at the ( 1,0,0 ) af zone center . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows constant energy cuts of the excitations in the h0l plane to emphasize this . </S>",
    "<S> note the weak af fluctuations at ( 1,0,0 ) and ( 2,0,1 ) in comparison to the excitations at the incommensurate positions . </S>",
    "<S> also note how a cone of scattering develops about the incommensurate positions , while the af zone center simply decreases in intensity as energy transfer is increased . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> a cut is also shown of the spin - wave spectrum at 1.5 k in the same energy window . </S>",
    "<S> the results at 20 k suggest a continuum of excitations within a cone of scattering ( as expected for low - lying excitations at the fermi surface ) , as opposed to the sharp excitations which are gapped below 17.5 k.    an estimate of the contribution to the electronic specific heat term from the removal of these low - energy spin fluctuations can be made through an analysis of the spectrum at 20 k. the specific heat of a cone of fast excitations centered on incommensurate wave vectors and extending out by an inverse correlation length @xmath9 = @xmath10 , is given by    @xmath11    where v@xmath12 is the cell volume , @xmath13 is the density of states and f(e ) </S>",
    "<S> = coth(e/2 k@xmath14 t ) . the upper limit in the </S>",
    "<S> energy integral has been taken to be e@xmath15 = k@xmath14 t ( above this energy , the specific heat contribution is small since df / dt approaches zero exponentially ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if we assume the density of states is the inverse of a large damping in energy @xmath16 = c @xmath10 , then the specific heat becomes    @xmath17    where c is the characteristic spin wave velocity . </S>",
    "<S> previous work has shown that the excitations lie within the hk0 plane around ( 0.6 , 0 , 0).@xcite note that due to the dispersion of the spin excitations , the contribution to the heat capacity is _ linear _ in temperature , which is exactly the same power law dependence for the electronic specific heat . </S>",
    "<S> this term arises due to these fast itinerant spin excitations in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 and is the reason for the enhanced linear component to the specific heat above t@xmath18 = 17.5 k. this calculation of a gap opening in the spin excitation spectrum is equivalent to a calculation of the gap opening in the fermi surface . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated by the similarity of the matrix - element - weighted density of spin - wave states and infrared spectroscopy measurements , which measure charge excitations.@xcite , @xcite the spin and charge degrees of freedom are strongly coupled .    </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic correlation length and spin wave velocity need to be extracted from our data to complete this calculation . </S>",
    "<S> our data has been fit to a standard formula for paramagnetic scattering from a system of correlated spins , also known as the chou model.@xcite this has been used to extract correlation lengths and spin wave velocities for excitations in the superconducting cuprates , for example.@xcite , @xcite , @xcite with this model , s(q , @xmath19 ) is represented as    @xmath20    where = - @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is the incommensurate wavevector ) , @xmath9 is the inverse of the correlation length @xmath23 , and the frequencies of the damped spin waves are @xmath24 = cq , where c is the spin -wave velocity ( @xmath16 = @xmath9c ) . fitting with these parameters yields a correlation length of @xmath23 = 14(2 ) </S>",
    "<S> angstroms , and c = 45(10 ) mev angstroms ( see figure 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is similar to the fermi velocity , reported as @xmath5 8.84 x 10@xmath25 m / s ( 35 mev angstroms)@xcite , illustrating the itinerant nature of the excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that there is a curious intersection of cuprate and heavy fermion physics with this analysis - the fast excitations seen in the superconductor la@xmath26sr@xmath27cuo@xmath28 ( lsco ) , which have an effective mass near an electron mass , appear similar to the excitations in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 , albeit with a higher velocity because of their lighter effective mass.@xcite    the contribution of the spin excitations to the specific heat of with these parameters for uru@xmath0si@xmath0 is 220 + /- </S>",

    "<S> the gapping of these excitations leads to a dramatic reduction in @xmath2 to 38(2 ) mj/(mol k@xmath29).@xcite , @xcite this is naturally explained through the gap in the spin excitation spectrum , which has minima at 2 mev and 4 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the average thermal energy below 17.5 k is less than 2 mev , and thus most of the spin excitations are inaccessible . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason for the reduction of @xmath2 through the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the size of the specific heat jump at t@xmath18 is still unresolved at this point although its low temperature limit arises from the removal of the spin contribution to leave a weak remanent ungapped electronic band . </S>",
    "<S> a gap opens in the spin excitation spectrum with a value of @xmath5 110(10 ) k , but the identity of this ordered state is still a mystery.@xcite through these measurements , we do know that the nature of the transition at t@xmath18   seems to be dominated by itinerant electron physics rather than localized crystal field effects . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason why uru@xmath0si@xmath0 shows a transition between itinerant and localized behavior at t@xmath18 , as shown through thermal conductivity measurements.@xcite indeed , we have seen no evidence of crystal field excitations up to at least 10 mev @xmath5 110 k. the complicated crystal field schemes which have been used to explain the heat capacity anomaly at 100 k , the hidden order state , and the anomalous thermal expansion at 60 k need to be re - examined within this framework . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements show that the first excited state , if allowed by selection rules , must exist above 200 k.    the role that these excitations play with the formation of the heavy fermion state can be examined through their temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> figure 5 shows recent heat capacity measurements , in comparison with inelastic neutron scattering scans at 100 k. note that the incommensurate features have disappeared at this temperature , often called the `` coherence temperature , '' which marks a cross - over from paramagnetic weakly correlated moments to correlated heavy electron behavior . </S>",
    "<S> they are intimately correlated with the coherence temperature and the formation of the heavy fermion state . </S>",
    "<S> this energy scale , as well , describes the temperature dependance of the heat capacity anomaly at 17.5 k through fits to an activation law,@xcite and the temperature dependence of the incommensurate excitations below 17.5 k.@xcite this is further evidence that the gapping of these excitations is directly related to the formation of the `` hidden order '' state .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , our recent neutron scattering results in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 unambiguously demonstrate that itinerant - style excitations exist above t@xmath18   at incommensurate wavevectors @xmath5 0.4 a * from the antiferromagnetic zone center . </S>",
    "<S> the gapping of these excitations accounts for the change in @xmath2 , the electronic contribution of the specific heat , through t@xmath18  . </S>",
    "<S> the hidden order transition appears to be a rearrangement of electrons at the fermi surface in an itinerant rather than localized electron picture . </S>",
    "<S> excitations out of this state at these incommensurate wavevectors show a mode softening which can perhaps be reminiscent of another dynamic ground state which has no translational order but a prominent specific heat anomaly - the superfluid liquid helium transition.@xcite correlations between the heavy quasiparticles in uru@xmath0si@xmath0 build up below 100 k , and at 17.5 k , there is a transition to a new condensate which still remains a mystery . </S>",
    "<S> even though cause of the change in the electronic specific heat has been identified , the true order parameter for this system has yet to be unveiled .    </S>",
