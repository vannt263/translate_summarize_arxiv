    "the analysis of an extensive body of experimental information suggests that in the heavy ion collisions at high energies performed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) is formed and it behaves like an almost perfect fluid @xcite , with small dissipation .",
    "this highly energetic fluid is very well described by relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "some years ago it has been pointed out @xcite that previously overlooked viscous effects could lead to processes such as cavitation in these systems .    in general it",
    "is well known @xcite that if a non - relativistic liquid at a constant pressure reaches the critical temperature , the consequent ruptures of cohesion between molecules leads to boiling . on the other hand",
    ", cavitation occurs when at a constant temperature the critical pressure drops below the vapor pressure and vapor bubbles are formed .    in an expanding quark",
    "gluon plasma , because of a non - vanishing viscosity , the pressure can become zero and even negative . in this situation cavitation would imply the creation of bubbles of a hadron gas phase in the quark gluon plasma phase .",
    "the evolution of these bubbles might have observable effects @xcite .",
    "the study of cavitation in the qgp was pioneered by the authors of refs . @xcite and",
    "further developed in ref .",
    "bulk viscosity has been a very active topic of research in heavy ion physics @xcite .",
    "it is generally understood that for qcd at high temperatures , bulk viscosity effects are much smaller than shear ones , as for high temperatures the conformal limit is well approximated @xcite . however , near the deconfinement region and in hadronic systems , large values of the bulk contribution have been found in several works @xcite .",
    "these large values might trigger cavitation in the evolving plasma .    in the present work we extend the formalism employed in @xcite to the case of finite chemical potential .",
    "from phenomenological studies of particle production in heavy ion collisions with the help of thermal models @xcite we can conclude that the baryon chemical potential is of the order of @xmath0 mev at lhc and @xmath1 mev at rhic . at lower energies",
    ", the chemical potential can reach higher values , @xmath2 mev . moreover , in the case of inhomogeneous freeze - out , even at high energies we can have domains of high chemical potential @xcite .",
    "recently the equation of state ( eos ) of the qgp at finite chemical potential was computed in lattice qcd simulations @xcite . in view of these results",
    ", we think that it is interesting to investigate the effect of finite chemical potential on cavitation . in the search for different phenomenological parametrizations of the bulk viscosity coefficient and other transport parameters , based on different many - body microscopic dynamics ,",
    "we have considered the holographic non - conformal model of qgp of ref .",
    "throughout this study we use natural units @xmath3 .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite is : @xmath4 where the @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the energy density and the pressure of the fluid , @xmath7 is the 4-velocity of the fluid ( @xmath8 is the lorentz factor @xmath9 ) with normalization @xmath10 .",

    ", symmetry constraints eliminate these contributions from the equations of motion @xcite . the heat flux @xmath16 satisfies the orthogonality property @xmath17 in the landau - lifshitz frame @xcite .",
    "the two relevant terms in the coupling of the dissipative equations involve the terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the bjorken flow",
    "the temporal component of the heat flux is zero ( @xmath20 ) , which leads us to the conclusion that the previous heat flux contributions are exactly zero @xcite .",
    "conservation of the energy and momentum is enforced by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the projection of this equation on the direction parallel to the fluid velocity reads : @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the projection on the direction perpendicular to the fluid velocity yields : @xmath24 .",
    "these two projections lead to the following evolution equations @xcite : @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the above equations we have @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the symmetrization of the indices is represented by @xmath30 .",

    "now we consider solutions of the hydrodynamical equations which do not depend on the transverse spatial coordinates @xmath60 and @xmath61 and are boost invariant in the @xmath62direction as in @xcite , which are the bjorken symmetries . to obtain the evolution equations in this boost invariant description",

    "we want to compare different equations of state and determine the effects of certain features of these eos ( such as , for example , finite chemical potential ) on the evolution of the fluid . to do this we would like to evolve them starting from the same initial state .",
    "however this is not possible because if they represent systems at the same initial temperature , then , these systems will have different initial energy densities and vice - versa . in relativistic heavy ion collisions , before thermal equilibrium formation , energy is released from the projectiles in a certain volume in the central rapidity region .",
    "it is perhaps more realistic to say that the quark - gluon system has first a defined energy density determined from the conditions of the collisions and then it reaches thermal equilibrium , forming a qgp with the properties determined by the equation of state .",

    "as previously mentioned , cavitation is generated when the longitudinal pressure , @xmath90 , is negative and it starts when @xmath144 in ( [ plon ] ) , where @xmath145 is the time at which the longitudinal pressure vanishes . in this subsection",

    "one interesting feature of such second order theory is that both bulk and shear evolution equations are nonlinear and coupled to each other .",

    "[ fig5 ] cavitation does not occur .",
    "it is often the case with holographic transport coefficients that dissipative effects seem to be smaller than others obtained from different methods , such as kinetic theory calculations .",
    "nonetheless , the holographic values for small ratio of shear viscosity per entropy density are consistent so far with experimental results , and thus we suggest that , if confirmed by experimental data , the absence of cavitation may be a consequence of the strongly coupled nature of qgp .",
    "in order to compare the models @xmath137 and @xmath138 with the non - conformal holographic model we show again , in fig . [ fig8 ] and in fig . [ fig9 ] the same plots of the temperature and longitudinal pressure evolution previously presented in fig .",

    "this was done through a numerical integration of the bjorken hydrodynamical equations and determination of the pressure as a function of proper time .",
    "we used a phenomenological parametrization of the lattice qcd equation of state with two sets of transport coefficients . for the bulk viscosity we used a parametrization of results obtained in a monte - carlo simulation of pure gluon dynamics su(3 ) @xcite . for both lattice qcd and mean field qcd equations of state",
    ", cavitation occurs at smaller time scales as the chemical potential increases .    as is often the case with transport coefficients calculated with lattice methods near the phase transition , the height of the bulk per entropy density peak is not generally well established , most calculations rely on pure glue dynamics and consequently on the existence of first order phase transitions .",
    "we considered a phenomenological holographic calculation of transport coefficients of a non - conformal qgp @xcite . in our approach , we conclude that cavitation does not occur in the holographic prescription , specially due to the small bulk viscosity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : first6 ] and by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zetafit ] ) .",
    "even with the addition of more transport coefficients ( which contain peaks near the crossover phase transition ) this approach does not support cavitation . in the future it may be possible to compare these distinct cavitation results in the scenario where lattice calculations of bulk effects can consistently consider the crossover phase transition .",
    "we hope that once the magnitude of bulk effects in the qgp is more precisely calculated , we can be more conclusive on whether cavitation occurs",
    ".    it should be interesting to generalize our calculations to more complex flows and check whether cavitation can be obtained in different regimes .",
    "also , a non trivial check of the observable effects of cavitation in qgp would be the study of stability properties of hadron gas bubbles , as well as how their collapse influences the overall evolution of the plasma .",
    "we leave such investigations for future work .",
