    "in contrast to dc - transport experiments , the applied external frequency @xmath0 of an ac - driven mesoscopic structure provides a new energy scale @xmath1 that permits one to access further properties of these systems , including their intrinsic charge distribution and dynamics .",
    "the interest in the ac - reponse of mesoscopic conductors goes back to the work of pieper and price  @xcite on the dynamic conductance of a mesoscopic aharonov - bohm ring .",
    "this pioneering work was followed by several experiments ranging from photon - assisted transport to quantum shot noise  @xcite .",
    "more recently , the ac - regime has been experimentally reinvestigated achieving the measurement of the in and out of phase parts of the ac - conductance  @xcite and the realization of a high - frequency single electron source  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the recent rise of interest in the full counting statistics of charge transfer has led to a reexamination of the frequency noise spectra  @xcite .",
    "this experimental progress has since triggered renewed theoretical interest in time dependent mesoscopic transport  @xcite .",
    "one way to tackle the ac - transport problem is to start from linear response theory for a given potential distribution of the sample  @xcite .",
    "this involves the difficulty that , in principle , the potential distribution and more precisely its link to the screening is unknown .",
    "another approach consists of deriving the ac - response to an external perturbation that only enters into quantities describing the reservoirs .",
    "such approachs were initiated by pastawski  @xcite within a non - equilibruium green function based generalized landauer - bttiker formalism , and then the scattering matrix formalism of a time - dependent system was developed by bttiker et al .",
    "since the energy is in general no longer conserved for an ac - bias , the formalism is based on the concept of a scattering matrix that depends on two energy arguments  @xcite or equivalently on two times  @xcite . fortunately , when the inverse frequency is small compared to the time to escape the cavity , the ac - transport can be expressed in terms of the derivative of the scattering matrix with respect to energy  @xcite . in this article we start from the time dependent scattering matrix formalism and limit our investigations to open , classically chaotic ballistic conductors in the low - frequency regime  @xcite .    for ac - transport",
    "we calculate the average correlator of scattering matrices @xmath2 at different energies @xmath3 . for this",
    "we need to know the joint distribution of the matrix elements @xmath4 at different values of the energy or other parameters .",
    "( we label the reservoirs connected to the conductor by a greek index and the mode number by a latin index . ) to our knowledge a general solution to this problem does not yet exist for chaotic systems .",
    "however , in the limit of a large number of channels , the first moments of the distribution @xmath5 were derived using both semiclassical methods  @xcite and various random matrix theory ( rmt ) based methods  @xcite .",
    "although the ac - transport properties of ballistic chaotic systems seem to be well described by the rmt of transport  @xcite , we develop a semiclassical approach for three reasons : first , this allows us to confirm the random matrix prediction by using a complementary trajectory - based semiclassical method .",
    "second , the energy dependence in the random matrix formalism was introduced by resorting to artificial models such as the `` stub model ''  @xcite . while being powerful , this treatment is far from microscopic or natural .",
    "the third and strongest reason is to go beyond the rmt treatment and investigate the crossover to the classical limit .",
    "similarly as for the static case rmt is not applicable in this regime .",
    "as first noticed by aleiner and larkin  @xcite , ballistic transport is characterized by a new time scale , known as the ehrenfest time @xmath6  @xcite , that controls the appearance of interference effects .",
    "the ehrenfest time corresponds to the time during which a localized wavepacket spreads to a classical length scale .",
    "typically , in open chaotic systems two such lengths are relevant , the system size @xmath7 and the lead width @xmath8 .",
    "we can thus define an ehrenfest time associated with each one  @xcite , the closed - cavity ehrenfest time , [ tec ] _",
    "e^cl= ^-1 , and the open - cavity ehrenfest time , [ teo ] _",
    "e^op= ^-1 , where @xmath9 is the classical lyapunov exponent of the cavity .",
    "although the success of the semiclassical method ( beyond the so - called diagonal approximation , see below ) to describe quantitatively universal and non universal dc - transport properties is now clearly established  @xcite , the corresponding semiclassical understanding of frequency dependent transport is far less developed .",
    "based on an earlier semiclassical evaluation of matrix element sum rules by wilkinson  @xcite and a semiclassical theory of linear response functions  @xcite , a semiclassical approach to the frequency - dependent conductivity within the kubo - formalism led to an expression of the ac-(magneto- ) conductivity@xmath10 @xmath11 in terms of a trace formula for classical periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "closely related to this evaluation of @xmath11 is the problem of frequency - dependent ( infrared- ) absorption@xmath12 in ballistic mesoscopic cavities which has been treated semiclassically in ref .",
    "peaks in the absorption could be assigned to resonance effects when the external frequency @xmath0 corresponds to the inverse periods of fundamental periodic orbits in the cavity .",
    "[ ] contains a first , @xmath13-model based approach to weak localization effects in the ac - kubo conductivity , where the findings were interpreted in a quasiclassical trajectory picture ( beyond the diagonal approximation ) .",
    "we note also that the semiclassical treatment of the product of scattering matrices @xmath2 at different energies , has been investigated in different context such as the ericson fluctuations  @xcite and the time delay  @xcite , however without considering the ehrenfest time dependence .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : in section  [ model ] we introduce our model to treat the system of interest namely a quantum dot under ac bias , and recall some basic results about conservation laws in presence of a time dependent field . in sect .",
    "[ method ] we present the method used to treat screening , which is based on a self - consistent approach developed by bttiker et al .",
    "the admittance , i.e.   the ac - conductance , is then calculated semiclassically for the particular case of strong coupling to the leads ( transparent contact ) in sect .",
    "[ sec - notunel ] , where we illustrate our result by treating the time dependence of a pulsed cavity .",
    "we generalize the method to cope with arbitrary tunnel rates in sect .",
    "[ sec - tunel ] , and finally we use our general results to investigate dephasing effects on the charge relaxation resistance of a mesoscopic capacitor in sect .",
    "[ mesocapa ] .",
    "we consider a ballistic quantum dot , i.e.  a two - dimensional chaotic cavity coupled to @xmath14 electron reservoirs via @xmath14 leads .",
    "each lead @xmath15 has a width @xmath16 and is coupled to the cavity through a tunnel barrier ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the treatment of ref .",
    "[ ] we assign a particular tunnel probability to each lead mode .",
    "the tunnel barrier is thus characterized by a set of transmission probabilities , @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the maximum mode number of lead @xmath15 .",
    "the chaotic dot is additionally capacitively coupled to a gate connected to a reservoir at voltage @xmath19 , from which a current @xmath20 flows .",
    "this capacitive coupling with the gate is taken into account via a geometrical capacitance @xmath21",
    "@xcite .",
    "we further require that the size of the contact is much smaller than the system size @xmath22 , but still semiclassically large , @xmath23 .",
    "this requirement ensures that the particle spend enough time inside the cavity to experience the chaotic dynamics .    as usual for such mesoscopic structures we need to distinguish between quantum and classical time scales . on the quantum side",
    "we have already introduced the ehrenfest times ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) in eqs .",
    "( [ tec],[teo ] ) , while another time scale is the heisenberg time @xmath26 , the time to resolve the mean level spacing of the system . on the classical side the time of flight @xmath27 between two consecutive bounces at the system cavity wall",
    "is relevant . in most ballistic systems or billiards",
    "we have @xmath28 .",
    "another relevant time scale is the ballistic ergodic time @xmath29 which determines how long it takes for an electron to visit most of the available phase space .",
    "however , as we deal with transport properties , a further important time scale is the dwell time @xmath30 , the average time spent in the cavity before reaching the contact , we have @xmath31 .",
    "the related escape rate therefore satisfies [ tddef ] _",
    "d^-1 = _ h ^-1 _",
    "= 1^m _ i=1^n _",
    "_ , i . for small openings which we consider here , we have @xmath32 .",
    "the ac - transport properties of such a mesoscopic system are characterized by the dimensionless admittance g _ ( ) = g_()/ g_0 = g^-1_0 i _ ( ) / u _ ( ) , with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 or @xmath35 in the absence or presence of spin degeneracy . in this study",
    "we limit ourselves to the coefficients @xmath36 with @xmath37 where the coefficients denoting the gate are determined by current conservation and the freedom to choose the zero point of energy  @xcite , [ current - cons ] _",
    "= 0^m g _ ( ) = _ = 0^m g _ ( ) = 0 .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ current - cons ] ) is a straightforward consequence of the underlying gauge invariance .",
    "owing to the conservation of charge , the total electric current fulfills the continuity equation [ continuity ] _",
    "p + t = 0 , where @xmath38 is the charge density and @xmath39 the particle current density . for dc - transport , the charge density is time independent and so we have @xmath40 .",
    "thus the sum of all currents that enter into the dot is always zero .",
    "moreover the current properties must remain unchanged under a simultaneous global shift of the voltages of the reservoirs .",
    "these conditions imply the well know unitarity of the scattering matrix@xcite , _ , i s_;ij^(e ) s_;ik(e ) = _ ; jk . for ac - transport , the product of scattering matrices at different energies no longer obey a similar property  @xcite i.e._,i s_;ij^(e ) s_;ik(e^ ) = _ ; jk , indeed this inequality expresses the fact that , due to the possible temporary pile up of charge in the cavity , the particle current density no longer satisfies @xmath40 .",
    "however one can instead use the poisson equation [ poisson ] = , where @xmath41 with @xmath42 the electric potential , to define the total electric current density which satisfies @xmath43 , as a sum of a particle and a displacement current : [ currentdens ] * j * = * j*_p + t. in order to find @xmath44 one needs to know the electrical field @xmath45 . in general its calculation",
    "is not a trivial task because the intrinsic many - body aspect of the problem makes the treatment of the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) tricky , especially if it is necessary to treat the particle and displacement current on the same footing .    in this work",
    "we shall adopt the approach of ref .",
    "[ ] to simplify the problem . in this approach",
    "the environment is reduced to a single gate , the coulomb interaction is described by a geometrical capacitance @xmath21 , and the two currents are treated on different footing ; the particle current is calculated quantum mechanically via the scattering approach , while the displacement current is treated classically via the electrostatic law ( eqs .",
    "( [ continuity],[poisson ] ) ) . this simplification will permit us below to re - express the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) to obtain the simplest gauge invariant theory that takes care of the screening .",
    "we emphasize that even though our model could be thought of as oversimplified it has the advantage of being able to probe the effects due to the long range coulomb interaction . indeed , for non - interacting particles it is possible to treat the dot and the gate via two sets of uncorrelated continuity equations .",
    "the coulomb interaction removes this possibility , and we need to consider the gate and dot as a whole system .",
    "the method to compute the admittance proceeds in two steps@xcite : first the direct response ( particle current ) to the change of the external potential is calculated under the assumption that the internal potential @xmath46 of the sample is fixed .",
    "this leads to the definition of the unscreened admittance @xmath47 .",
    "second , a self - consistent procedure based on the gauge invariance ( current conservation and freedom to choose the zero of voltages ) is used to obtain the screened admittance @xmath36 .",
    "the unscreened admittance reads  @xcite [ eq : unscreen ] & & g^u_()= e + & & , where @xmath48 stands for the fermi distribution , @xmath49 is the @xmath50 scattering matrix from lead @xmath51 to lead @xmath15 , and @xmath52 is an @xmath53 identity matrix . under the assumption that @xmath54 is spatially uniform , the screened admittance @xmath36 is straightforward to obtain  @xcite . for sake of completeness",
    "we present here only the outline of the method and refer to ref .",
    "[ ] for more details .",
    "on the one hand the current reponse at contact @xmath15 is _ ( ) = g_0 , where @xmath55 is the unknown internal reponse of the mesoscopic conductor generated by the fluctuating potential @xmath56 . on the other hand",
    "the current induced at the gate is _ 0 ( ) = - _ i _ c [ u_0 ( ) - u ( ) ] .",
    "gauge invariance permits a shift of @xmath57 and provides an expression for the unknown internal response , g^i_0 ( ) = - _ = 1^m g^u _ ( ) .",
    "then current conservation , @xmath58 , yields the result of the screened admittance  @xcite , [ eq : screen ] g _ ( ) = g_^u ( ) + . in the self - consistent approach used to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : screen ] ) , the only electron - electron interaction term that has been considered is the capacitive charging energy of the cavity .",
