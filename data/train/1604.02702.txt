    "in this paper , we provide theoretical results regarding estimation of the spectral representation of the covariance operator of stationary hilbertian time series .",
    "this is a generalization of the method developed in @xcite to a setting of random elements in a separable hilbert space .",
    "the approach taken in @xcite relates to functional pca and , similarly to the latter , relies strongly on the karhunen - love ( k - l ) theorem .",
    "the authors develop the theory in the context of curve time series , with each random curve in the sequence satisfying the conditions of the k - l theorem which , together with a stationarity assumption , ensures that the curves can all be expanded in the same basis  namely , the basis induced by their zero - lag covariance function . the idea is to identify the dimension of the space @xmath1 spanned by this basis ( finite by assumption ) , and to estimate @xmath1 , when the curves are observed with some degree of error .",
    "specifically , it is assumed that the statistician can only observe the curve time series @xmath2 , where @xmath3 whereas the curve time series of interest is actually @xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are random functions ( curves ) defined on @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "estimation of @xmath1 in this framework was previously addressed in @xcite assuming the curves are iid ( in @xmath9 ) , a setting in which the problem is indeed unsolvable in the sense that one can not separate @xmath6 from @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite propose a deus ex machina solution which consists in assuming that @xmath7 goes to @xmath10 as the sample size grows .",
    "@xcite in turn resolve this issue by imposing a dependence structure in the evolution of @xmath4 .",
    "their key assumption is that , at some lag @xmath11 , the @xmath11-th lag autocovariance matrix of the random vector composed by the fourier coefficients of @xmath6 in @xmath1 , is full rank . in our",
    "setting this corresponds to assumption  [ thm : bathia - thm-1-a1 ] ( see below ) .    in @xcite",
    "it is assumed that each of the stochastic processes @xmath12\\right)$ ] satisfy the conditions of the k - l theorem ( and similarly for @xmath7 ) , and as a consequence the curves are in fact random elements with values in the hilbert space @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "therefore , since every separable hilbert space is isomorphic to @xmath13 $ ] , the idea of a generalization to separable hilbert spaces of the aforementioned methodology might seem , at first , rather dull .",
    "the issue is that _ in applications transforming the data ( that is , applying the isomorphism ) may not be feasible nor desirable_. for instance , the isomorphism may involve calculating the fourier coefficients in some ` rule - of - thumb ' basis which might yield infinite series even when the curves are actually finite dimensional .",
    "the approach that we take here relies instead on the key feature that a centered hilbertian random element of strong second order , lies almost surely in the closed linear span of its corresponding covariance operator .",
    "this result allows one to dispense with considerations of ` sample path properties ' of a random curve by addressing the spectral representation of a hilbertian random element directly .",

    "a more realistic scenario would admit that associated to every measurement there is an intrinsic error  due to rounding , imprecise instruments , etc . in that case observations",
    "would be of the form @xmath55 in fact , the latter model nests the ` no noise ' one if we allow the @xmath7 to be degenerate .",
