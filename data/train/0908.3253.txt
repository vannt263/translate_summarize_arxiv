    "such special values are : @xmath11 , whose transcendence follows from the lindemann s proof that @xmath12 is transcendental ( 1882 )  @xcite , @xmath13 , as shown by chudnovsky ( 1976 )  @xcite , @xmath14 , as proved by le lionnais ( 1983 )  @xcite , and @xmath15 , as can be deduced from a theorem of schneider ( 1941 ) on the transcendence of the beta function at rational entries  @xcite .",
    "the most recent result in this line was obtained by grinspan ( 2002 ) , who showed that at least two of the numbers @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath12 are algebraically independent  @xcite . for other rational values of @xmath1 in the interval @xmath10 ,",
    "not even irrationality was established for @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath19 , known as the log - gamma function , on the other hand , received less attention with respect to the transcendence at rational points . in a recent work , however , gun , murty and rath ( gmr ) have presented a `` theorem '' asserting that  @xcite :    [ conj : gmr ] the number @xmath20 is transcendental for any rational value of @xmath1 , @xmath21 , with at most * one * possible exception .",

    "my theorem on the transcendence of @xmath44 depends upon the fundamental theorem of baker ( 1966 ) on the transcendence of linear forms in logarithms .",

    "indeed , if one of the two exceptions is for @xmath26 , then the other , for @xmath77 , would yield a third exception , corresponding to @xmath85 , which is again prohibited by theorem  [ teo : meu ] .",
    "then the two exceptions are for values of the argument distinct from @xmath86 and then @xmath79 is a transcendental number .    from this theorem , it is straightforward to conclude that    the number @xmath4 is algebraic if and only if @xmath76 is a transcendental number for every @xmath54 , except @xmath80 .",
