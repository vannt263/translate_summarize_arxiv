    "accurately capturing the correlated motion of electrons in atoms , molecules , and solids remains an active research area today . in ground - state electronic structure problems ,",
    "the difficulties of solving many - electron systems are rolled up into the correlation energy , a.k.a . _ the stupidity energy _",
    "it has been examined in many different scenarios and various limits , but its complexity still haunts us today . essentially representing the deviation of the many - electron wavefunction from an antisymmetrized product of single - particle orbitals , correlation plays a significant role in time - dependent problems as well .",
    "when atoms and molecules are exposed to either perturbative or non - perturbative external fields , fascinating and subtle electron interaction effects mean one must go beyond the `` single active electron '' picture , yet to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for more than two electrons in strong fields pushes today s computational limits  @xcite .",
    "the advent of time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) in 1984  @xcite opened up the possibility of using single - particle orbitals to describe the dynamics of interacting electrons exactly . in tddft a single slater determinant ( ssd ) in a non - interacting system ( the kohn - sham ( ks ) system )",
    "is propagated in time , such that it reproduces the exact time - dependent density of the true interacting system .",
    "clearly the ks determinant is not the true interacting wavefunction , nor is it supposed to be an approximation to it ; nevertheless by the rigorous theorems of tddft all observables of the true , correlated , electronic system can be in principle extracted from it exactly . in practise , approximations are needed for the exchange - correlation functionals , limiting the accuracy of the method .",
    "tddft is a method of choice in the linear - response regime where the photo - spectra of atoms , molecules and clusters can be found accurately .",
    "the computational effort involved scales relatively well , so the spectrum of large systems such as the green fluorescent protein@xcite , or even candidates for solar cells  @xcite , have been studied .",
    "although it has proved successful for a wide variety of time - dependent problems  @xcite , its progress for real - time dynamics in non - perturbative fields has been slower .",
    "three major obstacles involve the lack of memory in the commonly - used functional approximations , lack of good functional approximations to extract observables not directly related to the density , and the inaccuracy of the usual functional approximations when the true wavefunction evolves far from a ssd  @xcite .",
    "recently a method that accounts for electron correlation semiclassically has been proposed  @xcite that will , in principle , remedy the aforementioned problems of tddft .",
    "the method operates within the context of time - dependent density - matrix functional theory ( tddmft ) , where the one - body density matrix is propagated in time . the second - order density - matrix enters into the equation for the one - body density - matrix ,",
    "so is approximated as a functional of the one - body density - matrix in tddmft .",
    "however it is still difficult to find approximations in tddfmt that work well when the true wavefunction evolves from being close to a ssd to being far from one  @xcite , i.e. those developed so far can not dynamically change `` occupation numbers '' . in the proposed method of ref .",
    "@xcite , a separate semiclassical propagation is done from which the correlation potential is extracted , and used to drive the actual propagation .",
    "the approach naturally contains memory effects carried along by classical trajectories , all one - body observables may be immediately extracted , and occupation numbers do dynamically evolve .    whether the proposed method is accurate for a given application however depends on how close the semiclassical dynamics is to the true dynamics . in the method , only the correlation component of the dynamics is treated semiclassically , while all other terms ( including hartree and exchange ) , are treated exactly .",
    "however , if the semiclassical dynamics deviates far from the true dynamics , the proposed method is unlikely to be accurate",
    ". therefore it is worth investigating how well a semiclassical description of the _ entire _ dynamics is for the problems of interest .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "we compute the semiclassical dynamics ( within the frozen gaussian approximation ) of model two - electron systems where the exact dynamics can be numerically exactly computed , so that we can test the accuracy of the semiclassical dynamics against this .",
    "we can also compare with the exact ks system : that is , using the exact exchange - correlation potential ( that yields the exact density ) , but comparing observables such as momentum - densities , computed directly from the ks ssd ( instead of using the unknown appropriate observable - functionals as in exact tddft ) .",
    "our examples model the following phenomena : states of double - excitation in spectra , dynamics in a strong oscillating field , and population transfer to excited states via resonant driving , or via an optimal field .",
    "the chosen systems are one - dimensional models of a quantum dot and a helium atom .",
    "we show both successes and failures of the semiclassical propagation for these applications .",
    "we expect however that the proposed method of ref .",
    "@xcite is more accurate than such a semiclassical treatment of the entire problem since there it is only the correlation component that is approximated semiclassically .",
    "so the results of our studies are expected to improve once applied in the context of the method of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our results also have relevance for semiclassical studies of dynamics in their own right ( i.e. outside of density - functional - type methods ) .",
    "although semiclassical treatments of dynamics have seen much interest for nuclear dynamics ( eg . refs .",
    "@xcite ) , there have only been a few applications to electron dynamics  @xcite and almost all involved a single electron .",
    "part of the reason is that in atoms there is a significant probability that classical trajectories will autoionize after a few cycles in the atomic well : through the electron interaction , one electron gains energy from the other and ionizes while the other drops below its zero - point energy ; a process that is classically allowed but quantum - mechanically forbidden .",
    "this is a manifestation of what has been called the `` zero - point - energy '' problem  @xcite , and happens also when there are coupled vibrational modes , for example .",
    "these trajectories create a lot of noise in the semiclassical sum , making the convergence very difficult , and so are typically terminated .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , accurate spectra of the he atom in both its collinear @xmath0 and @xmath1 configurations were obtained , by discarding trajectories where one electron reaches a certain threshold distance .",
    "theoretically , a question is whether fundamentally these trajectories should be excluded from the semiclassical sum .",
    "that is , if the semiclassics could be done with an infinite number of trajectories , whether these trajectories incorrectly contribute to the semiclassical sum .",
    "we find that indeed their contribution to the semiclassical sum decreases as more trajectories are added : in this sense , they are valid classical trajectories , and via phase - interference , the semiclassical dynamics restores the zero - point - energy , eliminating their contribution from the semiclassical sum . in practise , nevertheless , we must deal with a finite number of trajectories , so sensible ways to discard these trajectories must be devised .",
    "our results on the model atoms , as well as those on a model quantum dot , lend support to the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite that semiclassical dynamics is useful for electrons , for both spectra and dynamics in non - perturbative fields ( in some cases ) .",
    "a draw of semiclassics is the interpretive power it carries and we hope to use it also to to interpret mechanisms for processes involving interacting electrons , e.g. the role of correlation in multiphoton ionization and multielectron ionization .",
    "the `` flavor '' of semiclassics explored in the current work is the frozen gaussian ( fg ) dynamics , originally proposed by heller  @xcite .",
    "this is not one of the rigorous semiclassical propagators that satisfy the tdse up to order @xmath2 ; it is however closely related to the rigorous heller - herman - kluk - kay ( hhkk ) propagator  @xcite , which is based on a coherent - state representation of the semiclassical propagator . in section  [ sec :",
    "background ] , after a brief review of tddft and tddmft that explains the motivation behind ref .",
    "@xcite , we review some background regarding fg dynamics and how it is proposed to be used in the method of ref .",
    "@xcite in density - matrix propagation .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents results on one - dimensional model systems of two electrons , using fg for dynamics and spectra .",
    "finally , we make some conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we briefly review tddft , the motivation behind going from tddft to a density - matrix approach , why we consider a semiclassical approach to correlation , and semiclassical dynamics .",
    "tddft is an exact reformulation of the non - relativistic time - dependent quantum mechanics of many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "it operates by mapping the true problem of interacting electrons into a ficitious , non - interacting system of fermions , called the kohn - sham ( ks ) system , whose one - body density is , in principle , exactly that of the true system , and from which , in principle , all properties of the true system can be obtained .",
    "the many - body effects of the interacting system are modelled by a one - body potential , called the exchange - correlation potential @xmath3 .",
    "similar thus in flavor to ground - state density functional theory , its functionals are nevertheless quite different .",
    "for example , @xmath3 functionally depends on the entire history of the density , as well as the initial - state of the true system and the initial state of the ks system , @xmath4(\\br , t)$]@xcite .",
    "this _ memory - dependence",
    "_ is however lacking in most of the applications today : they use an `` adiabatic '' approximation , which simply feeds the time - evolving density into a ground - state approximation : v^adia [ n,_0,_0](t ) = v^gs [ n ] ( ) |_n()=n(t ) .",
    "[ adia ] with this simple approximation , tddft has had great success in calculating spectra and response : computationally it scales similar to methods such as time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) or configuration - interaction singles , but with accuracy that is usually far greater . yet , this simple approximation is also behind why in some cases approximate tddft fails : e.g. to capture states of double - excitation character a frequency - dependent kernel is required  @xcite , but the adiabatic approximation yields a frequency - independent kernel .",
    "the lack of memory in the usual functional approximations is also one of the reasons why the application of tddft to real - time dynamics applications has not progressed so fast .",
    "model systems for which exact results are available indicate that memory - dependence can sometimes be a crucial factor in the exchange - correlation potential  @xcite .",
    "another difficulty in real - time dynamics , is the problem of `` observable - functionals '' : although in principle all properties of interest can be extracted from the ks system , it is not known _ how _ to extract those that are not directly related to the density .",
    "one may write these observables as operators on the exact wavefunction , however substituting the ks wavefunction is usually a poor approximation .",
    "for example , for momentum distributions , it was shown@xcite for a model system with one electron ionizing that the ks momentum distribution incorrectly develops strong oscillations as the electron moves away .",
    "in the case of ion - momentum - recoil upon ionization of a model he atom , the ks momentum - distributions were found to be drastically wrong , displaying a single maximum instead of the characteristic two hump structure , and with a significantly overestimated magnitude@xcite .",
    "double - ionization probabilities are another example where a more sophisticated observable functional is needed  @xcite .",
    "a third problem arises when the true wavefunction evolves far from an ssd  @xcite .",
    "an illustration of this is in certain quantum control problems , where a laser pulse is found to take the system to a specified target e.g. populating an excited state .",
    "for example , a pulse can be found to move the @xmath5 ground state of helium to the @xmath6 excited state . as tddft stays in a ssd , with a single doubly - occupied orbital , for all times",
    ", it has great difficulty in describing a state that fundamentally is best described by two ssds .",
    "it should be emphasized here that in principle , tddft can describe this situation , however the exchange - correlation potential and observable - functionals are extremely difficult to approximate .",
    "to overcome some of the difficulties of tddft , we may attempt to use the one - body reduced density matrix , defined below , as the fundamental variable .",
    "this has the advantage of containing more information than the density while retaining similar concepts and system - size scaling as tddft .",
    "an advantage is that functionals for the momentum distribution and kinetic energy are given exactly in terms of the density matrix .",
    "the first - order spin - summed reduced density matrix is defined as : ( ,,t)= n__1 .. _nd^3r_2 .. d^3r_n + ^*(_1,_2_2 ...",
    "_n_n , t)(_1,_2_2 ...",
    "_n_n , t ) and can be diagonalized by the so - called natural orbitals , @xmath7 : ( ,;t ) = _ j _ j(t ) _",
    "j^*(,t)_j(,t ) here @xmath8 is the time - dependent occupation number of the @xmath9th natural orbital ( no ) , and @xmath10 .",
    "we can now interpret the quantum control example discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : backgroundtddft ] as an issue with the no numbers .",
    "the nos of the true system will begin with one no occupation near @xmath11 and the rest close to zero , and will end with two occupation numbers close to @xmath12 .",
    "the ks system , beginning in the ground - state ssd , has only a single natural orbital which is doubly occupied and time - evolution in the one - body ks hamiltonian means that the no occupation number always remains at @xmath11 . by using the density matrix of the true system as basic variable instead",
    ", we allow the no occupations to change and thus it should be better than ks at capturing the correct behavior with simpler functional approximations .",
    "the equation of motion for the density matrix is known as part of the bbkgy hierarchy of equations : i(,;t ) & = & ( - + v(;t ) + - v(;t ) ) ( ,;t ) + & & + d_2 f(,,_2)_2(,_2,,_2;t ) [ eq : rho1dot ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the second - order spin - summed reduced density matrix , conveniently decomposed as [ rhoc ] _",
    "2(,_2,,_2;t ) & = & n(_2)(,;t ) - ( ,_2;t)(_2,;t)/2 + & & + ( ,_2,,_2;t ) .",
    "for a closed - shell spin - saturated system . atomic units ( @xmath15 )",
    "are used throughout this paper . here",
    "the terms play the role of hartree , exchange , and correlation respectively . setting @xmath16 results in the tdhf equations .",
    "one could look to close this expression by expressing @xmath17 as a functional of @xmath18 and this is the usual approach in tddmft .",
    "one naturally seeks an adiabatic approximation in which the time - dependent density - matrix is fed into a @xmath14-functional bootstrapped from ground - state density - matrix functional theory  @xcite unfortunately , neither tdhf nor the adiabatic functionals lead to no occupation numbers changing in time  @xcite .",
    "thus we must look further afield to try and fix this .    a possible solution to this was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath17 is given by an auxiliary semiclassical dynamics calculation running parallel to the density - matrix evolution .",
    "that is , we time - evolve @xmath18 using eq .",
    "[ eq : rho1dot ] with eq .",
    "[ rhoc ] , where all terms are treated exactly quantum - mechanically _ except _ the last term @xmath17 of eq .",
    "this last term is treated as a driving term in this equation , its value obtained from the parallel semiclassical propagation of the system . at each time",
    ", the second - order density - matrix , the density matrix , and the density are calculated in the semiclassical system , which then uses eq .",
    "[ rhoc ] to extract a semiclassical @xmath17 .",
    "this term is then inserted in eq .",
    "[ eq : rho1dot ] as a driving term . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that such an approach addresses the main obstacles tddft and adiabatic tddmft approaches for real - time dynamics : memory is naturally carried along by the classical trajectories , initial - state dependence is automatically accounted for , all one - body observables may be obtained without the need for further observable - functionals , and no occupation numbers are time - evolving . we can expect this method to most improve upon the purely semiclassical calculation when in the high - density limit , as the dominating exchange affects will be treated exactly .",
    "various candidates for the semiclassical method to use in this scheme are possible , with their numerical efficiency inversely related to their semiclassical rigor and accuracy  @xcite .",
    "most efficient and least accurate is to use a quasiclassical propagation of the one - body wigner function  @xcite , while least efficient but most rigorous , solving tdse exactly to order @xmath2 , is to use the heller - hermann - kluk - kay ( hhkk ) propagator  @xcite .",
    "the frozen gaussian ( fg ) method  @xcite may be viewed as an approximation to hhkk , and was argued to be a good candidate for use in a `` forward - backward '' scheme for @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "we focus in this paper therefore on fg dynamics , and our present goal is to investigate how accurate it alone is for electron dynamics .",
    "although in the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , semiclassics is used only for the correlation component of the dynamics , the scheme is likely to be most accurate when the semiclassical propagation of the whole system is reasonably accurate .",
    "the purpose of the studies in section  [ sec : results ] is therefore to study how accurate fg dynamics on model systems is .      since the earliest days of quantum mechanics semiclassical methods have been explored , for the purpose of interpreting and understanding quantum mechanics via the more intuitive classical dynamics , and also for the purpose of approximation .",
    "these methods construct an approximate quantum propagator utilizing classical trajectory information alone .",
    "although there are a variety of forms ( e.g.  @xcite ) , their essential structure is a sum over classical trajectories : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the classical action along the @xmath22th trajectory , and the prefactor @xmath23 captures fluctuations around the classical path .",
    "miller  @xcite showed the equivalence of different semiclassical representations within stationary - phase evaluation of the transformations .",
    "semiclassical formulae have been derived both from largely intuitive arguments  ( e.g. heller s frozen and thawed gaussians  ref.@xcite ) as well as from rigorous asymptotic analyses of the quantum propagator  ( see e.g.  refs.@xcite ) that satisfy tdse to order @xmath2 .",
    "the latter are based on taking the semiclassical limit of feynman s path integral for exact quantum dynamics .",
    "this yields a propagator of van vleck form  @xcite , that requires solving a boundary value problem to find the classical paths eg . from @xmath24 to @xmath25 in time @xmath26 ; transforming these to `` initial - value '' representations where instead a sum over an initial coordinate - momentum phase - space is performed , makes the numerics significantly more feasible , especially for longer times and more degrees of freedom .",
    "semiclassical dynamics captures quantum effects such as interference , zero - point energy , tunneling ( to some extent ) , while generally scaling favorably with the number of degrees of freedom . as the propagator",
    "is constructed from classical trajectories , intuition about the physical mechanisms underlying the dynamics can be gained .",
    "although mostly used for nuclear dynamics in molecules , and condensed phases , there have been a handful of applications to electrons  @xcite .",
    "the reasons for the reluctance of applying semiclassics to electrons were recently discussed in ref .",
    "one is that the classical dynamics of interacting electrons are typically mixed with regular and chaotic regions .",
    "this makes the semiclassical sum over trajectories increasingly difficult to converge as time evolves .",
    "another is the classical autoionization problem discussed in the introduction ; we return to this in sec .",
    "[ sec : sftcai ] .",
    "a third problem is that the classical equations of motion become singular at the nucleus , where the potential diverges coulombically , requiring the need for regularization methods to be applied . as ref .",
    "@xcite showed however , this is apparently only a problem when systems are treated in reduced dimensionality : in three - dimensions , no special techniques are required to deal with the coulomb potential except for a set of measure zero trajectories which hit the nucleus head - on ( and these trajectories can be safely discarded ) .",
    "@xcite showed that all these obstacles can be overcome to make semiclassical calculations of atoms and molecules quite practical .",
    "the fg propagation we are exploring can be expressed mathematically as a simplified version of the hhkk propagator  @xcite where the @xmath27-particle wavefunction at time @xmath26 as a function of the @xmath28 coordinates we denote @xmath29 , is : [ frozg ] ^fg(,t ) = _ t_te^is_t/_0_0 _ iwhere @xmath30 are classical phase - space trajectories in @xmath31-dimensional phase - space , starting from initial points @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the initial state . in eq .

    ", each trajectory in the integrand is weighted by a complex pre - factor based on the monodromy ( stability ) matrix .",
    "the pre - factor is time - consuming to compute , and scales cubically with the number of degrees of freedom , but in the fg approximation , it is set to unity . as a consequence , although hhkk solves tdse exactly to order @xmath2 , the fg propagator does not ; also , although it can be shown that hhkk results are independent of the choice of width parameter @xmath35 , fg results are not . for all our calculations we take @xmath37 .",
    "neither the hhkk propagation nor fg are unitary ; typically we find the norm of the fg wavefunction decreases with time , and so we renormalize at every time - step .",
    "( in fact for the typically chaotic dynamics of interacting systems , the hhkk prefactor , and norm , grows with time  @xcite ) .",
    "the phase - space integral in eq .",
    "[ frozg ] is done by monte carlo , with the distribution of initial phase - space points weighted according to the initial distribution , @xmath38 .",
    "although monte - carlo methods scale as @xmath39 for positive integrands , the oscillatory phase can make the fg propagation very difficult to converge .",
    "the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite takes advantage of the `` forward - backward '' nature of the propagation of the second - order density - matrix ( i.e in the second - order density matrix , there is both a @xmath40 and a @xmath41 ) , which leads to some cancellation of phase for more than two electrons .",
    "we also observe that the spatial - symmetry of the initial - state is preserved during the evolution ( since the hamiltonian is for identical particles , exchanging coordinate - momentum pairs of two electrons does not change the action ) .",
    "as we study here two - electron singlet states , the wavefunction is spatially - symmetric under exchange of particles .",
    "we study the accuracy of fg propagation for several different systems involving two soft - coulomb - interacting electrons in a spin - singlet in one - dimension . because the tdse for two interacting electrons in one - dimension can be mapped onto a tdse for a single electron in two dimensions , the exact problem is easily numerically solvable , and we can compare our fg results to exact ones .",
    "the exact ones are obtained either using the approximate enforced time - reversal symmetry ( aerts ) algorithm coded in the octopus code  @xcite , or our own exponential mid - point rule code ( both use a fourth order taylor expansion for the exponential ) .",
    "we also comment on how these compare with results using various common approximations in tddft for either the exchange - correlation functional ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hookespectra ] ) , or for observable - functionals ( secs .",
    "[ sec : hookenopdist ] and [ sec : sftctrap ] ) .    in the latter case ,",
    "we compute observables from usual operators acting directly on the exact ks wavefunction : this enables us to isolate errors arising from the observable - functional approximation alone ( i.e. as opposed to errors from the approximation used for the exchange - correlation potential ) . for two electrons in a spin - singlet ,",
    "given the exact time - dependent density , it is straightforward to obtain the exact ks wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "we briefly review how . in one - dimension ,",
    "the continuity equation reads + = 0 , [ eq : ctuity ] and since the exact ks system reproduces the exact density at all times , j(x , t ) = j_ks(x , t)= 2   _",
    "ks^*(x , t ) .",
    "[ eq : j ] the last equality follows from the fact that for two electrons in a spin - singlet , there is just one spatial ks orbital @xmath42 ( doubly - occupied ) . writing @xmath42 as an amplitude times a phase , we deduce , _ ks(x , t ) = ( i ^x dx ) .",
    "[ eq : phiks ] so , the procedure is as follows : we solve the tdse exactly numerically , finding the exact two - electron correlated wavefunction .",
    "the density and current are then extracted from @xmath43 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ctuity ] ) , and then inserted into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phiks ] ) .",
    "usual approximations for observables in tddft evaluate the operator corresponding to the observable directly on the ks state ; although this is exact for observables directly related to the density , there are errors for other observables , e.g. the momentum - density , which is what we shall look at in examples  [ sec : hookenopdist ] and  [ sec : sftctrap ] .    in all cases , we will utilize the exact ground - state wavefunction to construct our initial state for propagation .",
    "this is to separate out any errors due to a poor ground - state . for a general case where the initial wavefunction is unknown exactly ,",
    "an appropriate approximate initial state ( e.g. sum of a few ks ssd s , or from a high - level wavefunction calculation ) would be used .",

    "we have grouped the levels into multiplets whose members become degenerate if the electron - interaction is turned off .",
    "each of the two states in the second and third multiplets are states of double - excitation character : they are mixtures of a single excitation ( where , in a non - interacting reference , only one electron is promoted from its ground - state orbital to an excited one ) , and a double - excitation , where both the electrons occupy excited orbitals  @xcite .",
    "the three states in the fourth multiplet are mixtures of a single - excitation and two double - excitations .",
    "such states of double - excitation character are well - recognized to be poorly described with the adiabatic approximation in tddft , which is used in almost all calculations  @xcite : instead of producing a multiplet of states , only one state is obtained in the adiabatic approximation , and it has only single - excitation character . in order to find the correct frequencies , tddft requires a frequency - dependent kernel to mix the ks single and double - excitations , as was derived in ref .",
    "the kernel is an _ a posteriori _ correction to an adiabatic approximation and although it has been recently tested on a variety of systems  @xcite , it is not widely used ; almost all codes still rely on the adiabatic approximation that fails to capture these .",
