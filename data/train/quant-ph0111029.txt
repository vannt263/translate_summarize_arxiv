    "more complete descriptions are given elsewhere.@xcite    a classical computer has binary bits with values that are either @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "a quantum computer is operated with quantum bits , called qubits .",
    "each qubit uses two energy levels of a quantum system for the components @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , a qubit can be in a state that is a superposition of these two components , @xmath3 a quantum computer would use a superposition of many qubit states .",
    "an n - qubit system has @xmath4 basis vectors , @xmath5 , which can be taken as products of the basis vectors of each of the @xmath6 qubits .",
    "an arbitrary combination of these can be written as @xmath7 an example of a basis vector for the five qubit case ( for @xmath8 ) is , @xmath9 = @xmath10 .",

    "an operation starts , proceeds and ends with every qubit in a given state . in the quantum case ,",
    "an operation can use qubits in a superposition of many possible basis states .",
    "operation on such superposition states can be equivalent to performing a large number of computations in parallel . the difficulty in utilizing this advantage arises from the fundamental nature of measurement in quantum processes , namely that measurement of the energy of an individual qubit will necessarily collapse the wave function so that the result can be only either @xmath11 or @xmath12 for each qubit .",
    "this requires algorithms that can yield definite answers to computations even though the square of the coefficients @xmath13 represent only probabilities .",

    "we describe here a proposed quantum computer with qubits made of electrons on the surface of a liquid helium film and describe our method for fabricating the qubits and the methods by which their quantum states can be manipulated and measured .",
    "this system was first proposed by platzman and dykman@xcite and has been described elsewhere.@xcite",
    "electrons are bound to the surface of liquid helium by the dielectric image potential .",
    "a repulsive pauli potential prevents them from penetrating into liquid helium .",
    "the hydrogenic - like potential is of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coordinate normal to the surface , and @xmath16 is the dielectric constant of helium .",
    "the energy levels form a rydberg spectrum , @xmath17 .",
    "we give parameters for liquid @xmath18he ; @xmath19 = @xmath20 , @xmath21 = @xmath22 mev , and the bohr radius for this problem is @xmath23 = @xmath24 nm .",
    "the average separation of the electron from the surface is @xmath25 = @xmath26 nm and @xmath27 nm for the ground and first excited state , respectively . the transition frequency between the ground and first excited",
    "state@xcite is @xmath28 ghz .",
    "these transitions can be shifted with a stark field@xcite applied normal to the surface .",
    "the potentials with and without a stark field are shown in fig .",
    "we identify the ground and first excited states of these electrons with the states @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . in order to address and control the qubits each electron must be localized laterally .",
    "this will be accomplished by locating electrons above microelectrodes ( posts ) that are separated by about @xmath29 @xmath30 m .",
    "the electrons will be separated from the tops of the posts by a @xmath29 @xmath30 m thick helium film .",

    "a voltage applied to a given post controls the stark field for the corresponding electron .",
    "an array of posts fabricated at the cornell nanofabrication facility is shown in fig .",
    "a prototype with lead wires to the posts and an isolated ground plane to screen the field from the leads has also been fabricated .",
    "numerical computations of the electric field from the posts and ground plane have been completed and fabrication of a final design is in progress .",
    "note that this system is scalable to an arbitrary number of posts or qubits .",

    "4 . the posts will be located in the bottom of a waveguide that transmits sub - mm radiation to the electrons .",
    "superconducting microbolometers will be located at the top of the guide to detect electrons that are allowed to escape from the posts .",
    "a tunnel - diode electron - emission source will be located above the electron detectors .",
    "electrons will be loaded onto the film through a hole in the detector chip , and one electron will be trapped over each post by an applied positive potential .",
    "the thickness of the helium film will be measured with a capacitor made of metal strips deposited on a part of the ground plane containing the posts that extends outside of the waveguide .",
    "the electrodes of the capacitor are in the shape of a comb with interwoven teeth spaced by approximately one micron",
    ". the system will be operated at @xmath33 mk to increase coherence times of the qubit states .",
    "our initial tests will be on a @xmath18he film .",
    "the microwave setup for @xmath18he is easier to work with because the transition frequencies are lower and the corresponding waveguide is larger .",
    "there a number of other advantages in using @xmath18he .",
    "liquid @xmath18he has a large viscosity at low temperatures .",
    "this should severely dampen high - frequency ripplons involved in t@xmath34 and t@xmath35 processes , although new decoherence processes involving interactions with the bulk @xmath18he may occur .",
    "thermal contact between the sample chamber and @xmath18he is much easier to achieve than for @xmath36he , and the surface is less affected by microphonics .",
    "finally , the larger separation of the electrons from the surface leads to a somewhat larger dipole interaction between neighboring states .",
    "nm above the surface of the helium film.,height=172 ]",
    "the operation would normally begin with all qubits in the ground state . then according to the requirements of the desired operations , each qubit",
    "would be prepared in some admixture of states @xmath11 and @xmath12 by stark shifting individual qubits into resonance with microwave radiation for a predetermined time.@xcite the state of the qubit @xmath6 will be @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the rabi frequency , @xmath40 is the strength of the rf field , and @xmath41 is the time the @xmath42 qubit is in resonance with the microwave field .    in general , computations will be implemented by applying pulses of radiation to interacting qubits .",
    "we illustrate a potential operating mode of the system by describing two qubits operated as a swap gate .",
    "the interaction between qubits is via the coulomb energy , which is much larger than the interaction between the induced dipole moment of each qubit .",
    "the dipolar component of the direct interaction potential between qubits @xmath43 and @xmath44 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the electron separation , and @xmath47 is the separation of the @xmath48 electron from the helium surface .",
    "start with one qubit in the state @xmath11 and the other in the state @xmath12 .",
    "next apply the same stark fields to both qubits so that the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 would be degenerate . in this condition the system will oscillate between the two states at a frequency given by the interaction energy , which in first order is given by @xmath51 .",
    "this frequency is @xmath52 ghz for a separation of @xmath29 @xmath30 m . by leaving the electric fields in this condition for one half cycle of this oscillation , the two qubits will swap states",
    ". it will be difficult to tune neighboring qubits to precisely identical stark shifts , and in practice we may sweep the stark shift of one qubit through resonance with a neighboring qubit.@xcite in this case , the final state of the qubit will depend on the rate at which the electric field is swept through the resonance condition .",
    "the wavefunction of the system of entangled qubits collapses when a measurement is made .",
    "thus , the states of all qubits must be read within the time scale is set by the plasma frequency @xmath53 ghz .",
    "we describe here our initial proposal for a destructive readout pending research into other schemes .",
    "we will apply a short , @xmath52 ns , ramp of an extracting electric field to all qubits .",
    "the potential for a fixed value of extracting field is shown in fig .",
    "the tunneling probability is exponential in the time - dependent barrier height .",
    "all electrons in the upper @xmath12 state will tunnel through the barrier within a short period of time when this probability becomes sufficiently large .",
    "the escape of an electron will be detected by the bolometer detector mentioned above . for this extracting field",
    "the tunneling probability will be negligibly small for electrons in the ground @xmath11 state .",
    "after the ramp is removed the remaining electrons will be in the ground state .",
    "subsequently , we plan to sequentially apply to each post an extracting field sufficiently large so that electrons in the ground state will tunnel from the surface.@xcite a @xmath11 will be registered for each electron detected and a @xmath12 for those states that are empty",
    ".    an alternate scheme would be to apply an extracting voltage to the post under one electron at a time . for small numbers of qubits in our initial exploratory experiments ,",
    "the system would then be prepared in the same state repeatedly and a different qubit sampled each time the operation is carried out .",
    "ultimately we hope to develop a non - destructive readout that will allow simultaneous measurement of the states of all qubits without allowing the electrons to escape .",
    "all logic operations must be accomplished in less time than it takes for the interactions of the qubit with the environment to destroy the phase coherence of the state functions . for electrons on @xmath36he the lifetime of the excited state @xmath12",
    "is limited by interactions with ripplons .",
    "the electron - ripplon coupling hamiltonian@xcite is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the normal component of the electric field that includes both the applied field and variations in the helium dielectric image field due to surface distortions , and @xmath56 is the amplitude of the surface height variation .",
    "the average rms thermal fluctuation of the surface is @xmath57 the transition from the excited to ground state requires a ripplon with a wave vector @xmath58 . for a single electron on bulk helium",
    "a radiationless transition occurs with the energy absorbed by electron plane - wave states for motion parallel to the surface and momentum absorbed by ripplons . for this case",
    "a calculation of t@xmath34 yields @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the transition frequency . at t@xmath61 mk , @xmath62 , and",
    "t@xmath34 @xmath63s .    for electrons confined by posts ,",
    "the lateral states are harmonic oscillator states of the image potential well of the posts .",
    "these are separated in energy@xcite by @xmath64 mk . for an array of electrons",
    "there is a band of plasma oscillations associated with each harmonic oscillator level , which for an electron separation of @xmath29 @xmath30 m on bulk helium has a band width that is greater than @xmath65 mk .",
    "the confining potential of the posts reduces the width of this band .",
    "preliminary calculations@xcite suggest that the width may be sufficiently small to prevent conservation of energy in a radiationless transition .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "6 where the transition is shown to be incommensurate in energy with an excitation between the harmonic oscillator states .",
    "suppression of this relaxation channel would lead to a very large value of t@xmath34 .",
    "if the confining potential does not sufficiently reduce the width of the plasma band , this will be accomplished with an applied magnetic field . a magnetic field confines the lateral states to landau levels with a band of plasma oscillations of width @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are , respectively , the zone - boundary plasmon of the ordered qubit array and cyclotron frequencies .",
    "the transitions between landau levels with the emission of one ripplon can not conserve energy and momentum for @xmath69 tesla .    the two - ripplon process can either cause a transition to the ground state or lead to dephasing by an incoherent phase modulation due to quasi - elastic scattering within a `` hydrogenic level '' by thermal ripplons with a wave vector equal to the inverse cyclotron radius@xcite . at @xmath33 mk and a field of @xmath70 tesla ,",
    "this leads to a dephasing time@xcite t@xmath35 of @xmath71 ms .",
    "single operations can be made in @xmath2 ns .",
    "thus , in principle , @xmath72 operations can be preformed in a decoherence time .",
    "high frequency ripplons are strongly damped on a liquid @xmath18he surface .",
    "thus , it is possible that the values of t@xmath34 and t@xmath35 may be longer than for @xmath36he .",
    "a possible dephasing mechanism for the case of @xmath18he is via interactions of the electron with excitations on the fermi surface of bulk @xmath18he .",
    "theoretical calculations of this mechanism have not been carried out .",
