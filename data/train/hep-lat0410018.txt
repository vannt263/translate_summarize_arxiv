    "the treatment of fermions in lattice simulations requires special care , and several different formulations have been found over the years . since aoki s lattice-2000 plenary talk @xcite one may wonder , whether the models using wilson - fermions and the staggered formulation really lie in the same universality class .",
    "it is difficult to clarify the situation in a four dimensional theory , where due to numerical costs the achievable statistical errors are too high for precision checks .",
    "hence we decided to investigate a two dimensional toy model , which is also accessible to analytical calculations .    for our study",
    "we choose the gross - neveu model , defined by the euclidean action density @xmath1 the fields @xmath2 are two component spinors and @xmath3 is a flavor index .",
    "the action possesses an @xmath4 flavor symmetry @xcite and is invariant under discrete chiral transformations @xmath5 spontaneous breakdown of this @xmath6-symmetry leads to a dynamical mass generation @xcite . moreover the model is renormalizable , asymptotically free and large-@xmath0 expandable .",
    "the large-@xmath0 limit is taken keeping the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath7 fixed .    an equivalent action , which is bilinear in the fermion fields results from the introduction of an auxiliary scalar field @xmath8 @xmath9",
    "in leading order of the large-@xmath0 expansion the fermion mass @xmath10 is given by the value of the constant field @xmath8 that satisfies the gap - equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spatial and @xmath13 the temporal extent . in our notation @xmath14 denotes the finite volume fermion - mass limit spontaneous symmetry breaking can occur even in finite volume . ] , and @xmath15 .",
    "we are interested in the universal curve @xmath16 versus @xmath17 , similar to the lscher - weisz - wolff - coupling @xcite .      in the continuum theory",
    "the calculation can be performed in analogy to the finite temperature calculation @xcite . in infinite volume",
    "the gap - equation can be solved in closed form .",
    "it has solutions at @xmath18 ( maximum of the effective potential ) as well as at @xmath19 ( minima ) with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a cutoff on the spatial momentum . in finite volume (",
    "@xmath12 finite , @xmath22 ) we have to specify the spatial boundary conditions .",
    "our choice are b.c . of the form @xmath23 which include periodic and antiperiodic b.c . as special cases .",
    "( [ infvolsol ] ) can be used to eliminate the bare parameter @xmath7 in the finite volume gap - equation .",
    "the physical scale in the renormalized theory is given by @xmath10 , which is kept constant while the cutoff is removed , allowing us to find solutions @xmath16 versus @xmath17 .",
    "[ continuum ] shows the results which strongly depend on the chosen angle @xmath24 . for all @xmath25 different from zero",
    "there is a `` critical volume '' below which no spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place @xmath26 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the euler - mascheroni - constant and @xmath28 the riemann - zeta - function .",
    "[ htb ]      the wilson term breaks chiral symmetry explicitly which can lead to difficulties . the gross - neveu model with wilson fermions was pioneered by aoki and higashijima @xcite .",
    "the authors found that in order to recover the @xmath6-symmetry in the continuum limit , it is necessary to introduce a bare mass parameter @xmath29 and tune it to a critical value .",
    "the fermion mass @xmath10 can be defined as half of the distance between the two degenerate ( at critical @xmath29 ) minima of the effective potential @xmath30 which is not symmetric at finite lattice spacing  @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ veffwilson ] ) .",
    "@xmath32 is the free wilson - dirac operator .",
    "this definition of @xmath10 coincides with that in the continuum theory for @xmath33 .",
    "[ htb ]    from fermion masses in finite and infinite volume we can construct curves corresponding to those in fig .",
    "[ continuum ] for a series of lattice spacings .",
    "the approach to the continuum for a fixed value of @xmath17 is shown in fig .",
    "[ aproach ] .",
    "[ htb ]      with kogut - susskind fermions it first has to be clarified how to treat the four fermion interaction .",
    "one method is to perform the spin diagonalization within the free theory , keep only one component of the fields ( @xmath34 ) and construct taste fields ( @xmath35 ) from one - component fields within a hypercube ( a square in 2d ) .",
    "once the taste fields are constructed , the four - fermion interaction @xmath36 can be written down and expressed in terms of the one - component fields , which leads to the action @xmath37 @xmath38 denotes the hypercubes and @xmath39 the position within a hypercube , such that @xmath40 . in two dimensions",
    "the phases are given by @xmath41 .",
    "the symbol @xmath42 stands for the symmetric lattice derivative . again",
    "the four - fermion interaction term can be traded for a scalar field . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out , that the lack of translation symmetry by one lattice spacing complicates a perturbative treatment of this model .",
    "an alternative staggered action , which cures this problem has got the interaction term @xmath43 both formulations lead to the gap - equation @xmath44 numerical solutions at a fixed @xmath17 for different lattice spacings are shown in fig .",
    "[ aproach ] .",
    "our large-@xmath0 calculation in the gross - neveu model allows for the following conclusions :    * both the naive staggered and the wilson formulation lead to the correct continuum limit of the finite volume massgap . * as in qcd , with wilson fermions an additive mass renormalization is necessary , which is absent with staggered fermions . * with staggered fermions",
    "the construction of physical fields is more involved and special care has to be taken when interactions are introduced .",
    "it should be mentioned however , that the leading order of the large-@xmath0 expansion is insensitive to problems that might occur at finite @xmath0 .",
    "therefore a calculation of the @xmath45-correction would be desirable . in a monte - carlo study at finite @xmath0",
    "some additional problems will show up , e.g. the lack of true spontaneous symmetry breaking in finite volume at finite @xmath0 and the problem of determining the critical bare mass with wilson fermions .",
    "eventually we plan also to investigate the taste reduction by taking fractional powers of the staggered determinant .",
    "there the question is open , whether a local fermion operator can be identified to give a solid basis to this approach @xcite .",
