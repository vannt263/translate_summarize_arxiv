    "this issue remains controversial for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the studies on the ladder hubbard model have indicated positive results for superconductivity@xcite .",
    "these results suggest the existence of a pairing interaction affected by the on - site coulomb repulsive interaction .    a system described by the hubbard model is a typical strongly correlated system .",

    "insulator transition@xcite . since the discovery of cuprate high - temperature superconductors , many researchers have tried to explain the occurrence of superconductivity in cuprates in terms of the 2d hubbard model .",
    "the results of quantum monte carlo methods , which are considered to be exact unbiased methods , do not support the existence of high - temperature superconductivity in this model@xcite . in our opinion , this is because the coulomb interaction @xmath0 is not large in quantum monte carlo calculations , where the range of accessible @xmath0 is very restricted because of the nature of the method .",

    "the af correlation is suppressed when @xmath0 is extremely large and larger than the bandwidth .",
    "a superconducting correlation is developed in this region as the af correlation is suppressed with the increase in @xmath0 .",
    "the development of a superconducting correlation is understood to be induced by spin fluctuation , which is induced by the kinetic charge fluctuation that conquers antiferromagnetism .",
    "this spin fluctuation in a strongly correlated region must be distinguished from that in a weakly correlated region .",
    "the latter is the conventional spin fluctuation that has been discussed extensively in the literature@xcite .",

    "we must acknowledge that fluctuations are important , and in particular , the charge fluctuation , as well as spin fluctuation , plays a significant role in stabilizing the pairing state .    the crossover behavior from weakly to strongly correlated regions or vice versa in the 2d hubbard model may belong to a universality class . the well - known kondo problem exhibits a crossover from the weak coupling region to the strong coupling region as the temperature @xmath154 decreases@xcite . the s - d model is mapped to an electron - gas model interacting with a logarithmic interaction , from which the scaling equation for the coupling constant @xmath151 was derived by the renormalization group procedure@xcite .",
    "the renormalization group equation for the s - d model agrees with that for the 2d sine - gordon model@xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard model is mapped onto the 2d sine - gordon model by a bosonization procedure@xcite .",
    "thus , these models ( 2d sine - gordon model , s - d model , and 1d hubbard model ) are in the same universality class from the viewpoint of scaling theory .",
    "we expect that , concerning the crossover between weakly and strongly correlated regions , the 2d hubbard model is also in this class given by the 2d sine - gordon model .    in conclusion , the crossover occurs from a weakly correlated to a strongly correlated region , and high - temperature superconductivity will appear in the strongly correlated region .",
