    ", it is well known that galaxies like our milky way contain up to @xmath1 to @xmath2 neutron stars , which are observed as pulsars ( rotating neutron stars ) .",
    "such objects contain ultra - dense hadronic matter as a permanent component of matter in their centers .",
    "radio telescopes , x - ray satellites  and soon the latest generation of gravitational - wave detectors  provide physicists and astronomers with an unprecedented wealth of high - quality data on such objects and thus serve as the observational windows on the inner workings of pulsars .",
    "this feature makes pulsars superb astrophysical laboratories for medium and high - energy nuclear physics ( plus other fields of physics ) @xcite .",
    "some of the key questions that can be addressed by studying the properties of pulsars are ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : multifaceted2 ] ) :    * what are the fundamental building blocks of cold ultra - dense matter ? specifically , does `` exotic '' matter exist in the cores of pulsars , such as boson condensates , color - superconducting quark matter , and multi - quark states ?",
    "* are there pulsar observables that could signal the existence of exotica in their cores ? * are there rotationally - driven ( accretion - driven ) phase transitions in pulsars ? * how does color - superconducting quark matter alter the properties of pulsars ? * what is the true ground state of the strong interaction ? is it ordinary nuclear matter ( i.e.  atomic nuclei ) or a color - neutral collection of up , down , and strange quarks ( so - called strange quark matter ) ? * what are the distinguishing features of pulsars made of strange quark matter rather than ordinary hadronic matter ? * what are the properties of matter subjected to ultra - high density radiation fields , ultra - high magnetic fields , ultra - high electric fields ? how do such fields alter the properties of pulsars ?",
    "* what are the key nuclear ( heavy ion ) reactions in the non - equilibrium crusts of accreting x - ray pulsars ? * how strongly do pycnonuclear reactions in the crusts of accreting neutron stars alter the thermal evolution of such objects ? * do gravitational - radiation reaction driven instabilities limit the spins of pulsars ? * what is the shell structure for very neutron rich nuclei in the crusts of pulsars ?",
    "do n=50 and n=82 remain magic numbers ?    before we discuss some of these issues in more detail , we review some of the key properties of neutron stars .",
    "the first property concerns the masses of neutron stars , which range theoretically from around @xmath3 ( where @xmath4  g is the mass of the sun ) to about @xmath5 .",
    "matter in the    centers of neutron stars possess densities ranging from a few times @xmath6 to an order of magnitude higher . here",

    "the number of baryons forming a neutron star is of the order of @xmath11 . rotating neutron stars",
    "are called pulsars .",
    "three distinct classes of pulsars are currently known .",
    "these are ( 1 ) rotation - powered pulsars , where the loss of rotational energy of the star powers the emitted electromagnetic radiation , ( 2 ) accretion - powered ( x - ray ) pulsars , where the gravitational potential energy of the matter accreted from a low - mass companion is the energy source , and ( 3 ) magnetars ( e.g , sgr 1806 - 20 ) , where the decay of a ultra - strong magnetic field powers the radiation .",
    "the fastest , very recently discovered neutron star , psr j1748 - 2446ad , rotates at a period of 1.39  ms ( which corresponds to 719  hz ) @xcite , followed by psr b1937 + 21 @xcite and psr b1957 + 20 @xcite whose rotational periods are 1.58 ms ( 633  hz ) and 1.61  ms ( 621  hz ) , respectively . psr b1957 + 20 is moving through the galaxy at a speed of almost a million kilometers per hour . due to this remarkable motion",
    "a bow shock wave is visible to optical telescopes .",
    "other significant pulsars are cen x-3 ( first x - ray pulsar ) , sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( first accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar ) , and psr j0737 - 3039a&b ( first double pulsar binary system , which will permit a strong - field test of general relativity ) . when neutron stars are formed they have interior temperatures of the order of @xmath12  k ( around @xmath13  mev ) .",
    "they cool by neutrino emission processes to interior temperatures of @xmath14  k within a few days . throughout most of the active life of neutron stars in pulsars and x - ray sources ,",
    "the interior temperature is @xmath15 k. surface temperatures are an order of magnitude or more smaller .",
    "measurements of the surface temperature of the crab pulsar ( b0531 + 21 ) , for instance , have led to @xmath16  k. ) rotating magnetized neutron stars in pulsars are surrounded by a plasma , the so - called magnetosphere , in which via plasma processes the electromagnetic radiation from pulsars is generated .",
    "the magnetic fields near the surface of neutron stars in compact x - ray sources play an important role in channeling the accreting matter onto the neutron star surface .    to date over 1600 pulsars are known .",
    "this figure is expected to increase dramatically with the operation of instruments like the square - kilometer - array ( ska ) .",
    "the sensitivity of ska will be around 100 times higher than the vla sensitivity ; it is expected that around 20,000 new pulsars ( including pulsars around black holes ) will be discovered with ska .",
    "the number of millisecond pulsars is expected to go up from its present value by a factor of 100 .",
    "the initial operations of ska will start around 2016 , and the final operations are expected to begin around 2020 .",
    "in 1939 , tolman , oppenheimer and volkoff performed the first neutron star calculations , assuming that such objects are entirely made of a gas of non - interacting relativistic neutrons @xcite .",

    "it is interesting to note that the inclusion of interactions among the neutrons increases the star s maximum mass from @xmath17 to around @xmath18 ( figs.[fig : ec ] and [ fig : mvsr ] ) .",
    "however , the radii of the latter stars are so big that mass shedding from the equator occurs for most stars of the sequence at rotational frequencies that are considerably smaller than 716  hz observed for psr  j1748 - 2446ad , or b1937 + 21 , 630  hz ( 1.58  ms ) @xcite .",
    "an interacting neutron gas thus fails to accommodate the rotational frequencies of the most rapidly rotating , observed neutron stars .",
    "the other extreme , a non - interacting relativistic neutron gas , fails too since it does not accommodate the hulse - taylor pulsar ( @xmath19 ) @xcite , and also conflicts with the average neutron star mass of @xmath20 derived by thorsett and chakrabarty @xcite from observations of radio pulsar systems .",
    "more than that , recent observations indicate that neutron star masses may be as high as around @xmath21 .",

    "this value follows from a general , theoretical estimate of the maximal possible mass of a stable neutron star @xcite .",
    "if either one of the two objects 4u170037 or 2s0921630 were a black hole , it would confirm the prediction of the existence of low - mass black holes @xcite .",

    "the condensation of negatively charged mesons in neutron star matter is favored because such mesons would replace electrons with very high fermi momenta .",
    "early estimates predicted the onset of a negatively charged pion condensate at around @xmath111 .",
    "however , these estimates are very sensitive to the strength of the effective nucleon particle - hole repulsion in the isospin @xmath112 , spin @xmath113 channel , described by the landau fermi - liquid parameter @xmath114 , which tends to suppress the condensation mechanism . measurements in nuclei tend to indicate that the repulsion is too strong to permit condensation in nuclear matter @xcite . in the mid 1980s",

    "we also note that @xmath118 condensation allows the conversion reaction @xmath130 . by this conversion",
    "the nucleons in the cores of neutron stars can become half neutrons and half protons , which lowers the energy per baryon of the matter .",
    "the relative isospin symmetric composition achieved in this way resembles the one of atomic nuclei , which are made up of roughly equal numbers of neutrons and protons .",
    "neutron stars are therefore referred to , in this picture , as nucleon stars .",
    "the maximum mass of such stars has been calculated to be around @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the collapsing core of a supernova , e.g.  1987a , if heavier than this value , should go into a black hole rather than forming a neutron star , as pointed out by brown et al .  @xcite .",
    "this would imply the existence of a large number of low - mass black holes in our galaxy @xcite .",

    "are easily reached in the cores of neutron stars so that the neutrons and protons in the cores of neutron stars may indeed be broken up into their quarks constituents @xcite .",
    "more than that , since the mass of the strange quark is only around 150  mev , high - energetic up and down quarks will readily transform to strange quarks at about the same density at which up and down quark deconfinement sets in .",

    "the gaps associated with this phase are @xmath178 , and the quark condensates of the cfl phase are approximately of the form @xmath179 , with color and flavor indices all running from 1 to 3 . since @xmath180 one sees that the condensate involves kronecker delta functions that link color and flavor indices .",
    "hence the notion color - flavor locking .",
    "the cfl phase has been shown to be electrically neutral without any need for electrons for a significant range of chemical potentials and strange quark masses @xcite .",
    "if the strange quark mass is heavy enough to be ignored , then up and down quarks may pair in the two - flavor superconducting ( 2sc ) phase .",
    "other possible condensation patterns are cfl-@xmath181 , cfl-@xmath182 and cfl-@xmath183 , gcfl ( gapless cfl phase ) , 1sc ( single - flavor - pairing ) , csl ( color - spin locked phase ) , and the loff ( crystalline pairing ) phase , depending on @xmath184 , @xmath84 , and electric charge density ( for references , see @xcite ) .",
    "calculations performed for massless up and down quarks and a very heavy strange quark mass ( @xmath185 ) agree that the quarks prefer to pair in the two - flavor superconducting ( 2sc ) phase where @xmath186 . in this case",
    "the pairing ansatz reduces to @xmath187 . here",
    "the resulting condensate picks a color direction ( 3 or blue in the example above ) , and creates a gap @xmath80 at the fermi surfaces of quarks with the other two out of three colors ( red and green ) . the gapless cfl phase ( gcfl )",
    "may prevail over the cfl and 2sc phases at intermediate values of @xmath188 with gaps given obeying the relation @xmath189 for chemical potentials that are of astrophysical interest , @xmath190  mev , the gap is between 50 and 100  mev .",
    "the order of magnitude of this result agrees with calculations based on phenomenological effective interactions @xcite as well as with perturbative calculations for @xmath191  gev @xcite .",
    "we also note that superconductivity modifies the eos at the order of @xmath192 @xcite , which is even for such large gaps only a few percent of the bulk energy .",
    "such small effects may be safely neglected in present determinations of models for the eos of quark - hybrid stars .",
    "there has been much recent work on how color superconductivity in neutron stars could affect their properties @xcite .",
    "these studies reveal that possible signatures include the cooling by neutrino emission , the pattern of the arrival times of supernova neutrinos , the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields , rotational stellar instabilities , and glitches in rotation frequencies .",
    "it is most intriguing that for strange quark matter made of more than a few hundred up , down , and strange quarks , the energy of strange quark matter may be well below the energy of nuclear matter , @xmath193  mev , which gives rise to new and novel classes of strange matter objects , ranging from strangelets at the low baryon - number end to strange stars at the high baryon number end @xcite .",
    "the presence of electrons in strange quark matter may lead to the formation of an electric dipole layer on the surface of strange matter , with huge electric fields on the order of @xmath194  v / cm .",
    "this peculiar feature enables strange quark stars to be enveloped in nuclear crusts made of ordinary atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "sequences of compact strange stars with and without ( bare ) nuclear crusts are shown in fig.[fig : mvsr ] .",
    "since the nuclear crust is gravitationally bound to the quark matter , the mass - radius relationship of strange stars with crusts resembles the one of neutron stars and even that of white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "in contrast to neutron stars , however , strange stars obey @xmath195 because they are self - bound and the mass density of quark matter is almost constant inside strange stars .",
    "the electrons surrounding strange quark matter are held to quark matter electrostatically . since neither component , electrons nor quark matter ,",
    "is held in place gravitationally , the eddington limit to the luminosity that a static surface may emit does not apply , and thus the object may have photon luminosities much greater than @xmath196 .",
    "it was shown by usov @xcite that this value may be exceeded by many orders of magnitude by the luminosity of @xmath197 pairs produced by the coulomb barrier at the surface of a hot strange star . for a surface temperature of @xmath198",
    "k , the luminosity in the outflowing pair plasma was calculated to be as high as @xmath199 .",
    "such an effect may be a good observational signature of bare strange stars @xcite .",
    "if the strange star is enveloped by a nuclear crust however , which is gravitationally bound to the strange star , the surface made up of ordinary atomic matter would be subject to the eddington limit .",
    "hence the photon emissivity of such a strange star would be the same as for an ordinary neutron star .",
    "if quark matter at the stellar surface is in the cfl phase the process of @xmath197 pair creation at the stellar quark matter surface may be turned off , since cold cfl quark matter is electrically neutral so that no electrons are required and none are admitted inside cfl quark matter @xcite .",
    "this may be different for the early stages of a hot cfl quark star @xcite .",
    "a neutron star is born with enormous reserves of rotational and thermal energy , which it looses over millions of years through processes such as magnetic dipole radiation from the magnetosphere , thermal radiation and electron winds from the surface and neutrinos from the core . in doing so",
    "the star cools down and changes structure as the radius diminishes with the rotation frequency  by as much as a few kilometers if it started out near its limiting kepler frequency  shifting the interior boundaries of any phase transitions there in the process .",
    "any latent heat evolved or absorbed by particles crossing these boundaries will contribute to the thermal evolution af the star , and in this section we discuss the formalism for describing these effects .",
    "the thermal evolution of a spherical star in general relativity is given by a local energy balance equation @xcite : @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the local luminosity given by the conduction of non - neutrino energy through a sphere of radius @xmath72 , @xmath202 is the rate , per volume , at which nuclear reactions create non - nuclear energy , @xmath203 is the neutrino emissivity per volume , @xmath204 is the rest mass density , @xmath205 is the pressure and @xmath206 is the specific internal energy per unit rest mass , which in the absence of any phase transitions may be written @xmath207 with @xmath208 the heat capacity per unit volume and @xmath162 the temperature . since @xmath209",
    "we then have @xmath210 so in this case @xmath211 which gives the usual heat balance equation for neutron stars @xmath212 however in the presence of any phase transitions the heat capacity may be discontinuous and this will give rise to extra terms as particles cross the phase boundaries in either temperature for superfluid transitions or in density if there is a transition from hadronic matter to quark matter . to see this for a sharp phase transition with no mixed phase , we may write @xmath206 as @xmath213\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath214 is the heaviside step function , @xmath85 can be either @xmath162 , @xmath204 ( which may be discontinous at the phase transition ) or some other convenient quantity depending on the nature of the phase transition , @xmath215 is the critical @xmath85 for the phase transition and numerical subscripts identifies a variable with either of the two phases .",
    "differentiating with respect to time we then get the same terms as above and additional terms from the heaviside functions : @xmath216\\;.\\ ] ] simplifying this we note that @xmath217 where @xmath129 is the entropy density , integrate by parts and use the phase equilibrium conditions that @xmath218 to get @xmath219\\;.   \\label{sharp}\\ ] ] this is of course the well known result that each particle crossing a phase boundary contributes to the surrounding medium an energy @xcite @xmath220=-t\\delta\\sigma$ ] , where @xmath55 is the entropy per particle . if @xmath85 is a continuous variable such as @xmath162 or @xmath205 the distinction between @xmath221 and @xmath222 is pointless and the delta functions may be taken outside , and a second order transition with continuous entropy density at the phase transition would then cause the last term in eq.([sharp ] ) to vanish .",
    "a mixed phase may be treated similarly by replacing the heaviside functions with a volume fraction @xmath164 , such that @xmath223 is the fraction of a given volume occupied by phase 1 and @xmath164 is that occupied by phase 2 so @xmath224 and hence @xmath225\\;. \\label{mixed}\\ ] ] the transition to a superfluid state is a second order transition taking place through a mixed phase with @xmath226 and @xmath227 for simple fermi gasses @xcite .",
    "the latent heat released in this process is customarily treated as an increase in the heat capacity letting @xmath228 with the effect of slightly slowing the cooling process  at temperatures around @xmath229 the reduction factor , @xmath230 , goes to zero and has the opposite effect of significantly accelerating the cooling .",
    "this has been extensively treated in the literature and we refer to @xcite for a recent review .",
    "the transition from hadronic to quark matter is a first order transition which will take place through a mixed phase @xcite if finite size effects and charge screening do not prohibit such a phase @xcite ( although see the comments in @xcite ) .",
    "if the transition is sharp it happens at a specific critical pressure , where the density will be discontinuous and heat will be released there at a total rate of @xmath231 , with @xmath232 the number of particles making the transition per unit time .",
    "if the transition is through a mixed phase the pressure and _ average _ entropy density , @xmath233 , vary continously in the region where the phase transition takes place , but the individual entropy densities will _ not _ be equal and particles making the transition will release heat at a local rate of @xmath234 , where @xmath164 will increase as the star becomes more dense .    to estimate whether the contribution from these terms makes any significant difference or we are just carrying coal to newcastle",
    ", we note that a transition from hadronic to quark matter may in a rough approximation be seen as a transition between free fermi gasses at different densities  one of them with a bag constant in the energy density , but this does not affect the entropy density . assuming both gasses are relativistic and degenerate the entropy per particle with boltzmann s constant set to one is @xcite @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the color degeneracy , @xmath237 is the particle density which for quark matter is three times the baryon density , @xmath238 , in the quark phase and in the hadronic phase is equal to the baryon density there , @xmath239 . the resulting term in in eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) is then on the order of @xmath240    \\frac{\\mathrm{d}n_q/\\mathrm{d}t}{10^{57}/10 ^ 7\\mathrm{yr}}\\mathrm{erg }    \\mbox { s}^{-1}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath241 k and @xmath242 is normalized to a whole star converted on a timescale of @xmath243 years . for the quarks @xmath244",
    "was canceled by a factor @xmath245 since it takes 3 quarks to make a baryon .",
    "this is a rather small contribution unless the temperature is high or the star is changing structure fast .",
    "furthermore the term is only positive if @xmath246 , but this condition is of course subject to the specific assumptions we made here and would change in a more detailed treatment of the eos .",
    "it should also be noted that this treatment accounts only for the latent heat from the deconfinement of the quarks , and that there would be further contributions from the subsequent weak reactions required to bring the matter into chemical equilibrium by converting @xmath128-quarks to @xmath129-quarks .",
    "these reactions would contribute to the @xmath247 and @xmath203 terms in eq .",
    "( [ balance ] ) and must be treated similarly to the rotochemical heating discussed by @xcite . as shown by @xcite",
    "it is furthermore very important to know exactly where in the star a heating source is located , since sources located below the outer crust of the star tend to contribute only to the neutrino luminosity and make little difference to the surface temperature . in spite of such reservations one",
    "might still optimistically expect to find signals from the latent heat of a quark matter phase transition either early in a star s thermal history , when it is hot and spinning down rapidly , or from later episodes of rapid structure change",
    ". such rapid structure change could result from glitches , which may be associated with the buildup and release of stress in a crystalline mixed quark hadron phase @xcite , or the appearance of quark matter in a neutron star core , which softens the equations of state and allows the star to change structure rapidly possibly even through a core quake if a metastable state can be accessed @xcite .",
    "future work will explore these possibilities .",
    "obviously , our view of the interior composition of pulsars , which contain matter in one of the densest forms found in the universe , has changed dramatically since their first discovery some 40 years ago .",
    "it has also become clear during that time period that all the ambient conditions that characterize pulsars tend to the extreme as well , rendering pulsars to almost ideal astrophysical laboratories for a broad range of physical studies .",
    "owing to the unprecedented wealth of high - quality data on pulsars provided by radio telescopes , x - ray satellites  and soon the latest generation of gravitational - wave detectors  it seems within reach to decipher the inner workings of these enigmatic objects , and to explore the phase diagram of cold and ultra - dense hadronic matter from astrophysics .",
