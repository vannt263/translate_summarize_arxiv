    "many field models were found to support classical solutions which have finite energies and extend field configurations .",
    "such solutions are referred to as solitons or defects , and have been applied in many branches of physics research , ranging from condensed matter physics  @xcite , particle physics  @xcite , to cosmology  @xcite .",

    "the temptation for finding higher - dimensional defect solutions in canonical one - component scalar field theory is forbidden by the derrick theorem  @xcite .",
    "however , higher - dimensional defect solutions were found in some scalar field models , where the scalar fields have noncanonical kinetic terms  @xcite .",

    "<S> twinlike defects refer to topological defect solutions of some apparently different field models that share the same defect configuration and the same energy density . </S>",
    "<S> usually , one can distinguish twinlike defects in terms of their linear spectra , but in some special cases twinlike defects even share the same linear spectrum . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the algebraic conditions for two twinlike defects to share identical linear spectrum from the viewpoint of the normal modes of the linear fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend our discussion to braneworld models , where gravity plays an important role . </S>"
