    "in the past few years , there has been a remarkable amount of progress in the study of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite and an intense investigation of the localized nonlinear states that can be formed therein @xcite . from the nonlinear dynamics point of view ,",
    "one of the features that makes this system a particularly relevant and interesting one is associated with the presence of a diverse range of external potentials which are used to trap the atoms magnetically , optically or electrically ( or through combinations thereof ) @xcite .",
    "hence , monitoring the existence , stability and dynamical properties of nonlinear localized modes within these diverse potentials has become a principal theme of research effort , especially within the realm of the prototypical mean - field model , namely the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation ( which is a variant of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation extensively used in nonlinear optics @xcite ) .",
    "while most of the work in becs has centered around one - component systems , more recently far - off - resonant optical techniques for trapping ultracold atomic gases @xcite , have produced an intense focus on the study of _ spinor _ becs @xcite , in which the spin degree of freedom ( frozen in magnetic traps ) emerges . in this context",
    ", various phenomena absent in single - component becs may arise in the dynamical evolution of multi - component spinor condensates @xcite , including the formation of spin domains @xcite and spin textures @xcite , spin - mixing dynamics @xcite , dynamic fragmentation @xcite , or dynamics of quantum phases @xcite .",
    "moreover , macroscopic nonlinear states in the form of multi - component vector solitons of the bright @xcite , dark @xcite and gap @xcite type , along with more complex structures , such as bright - dark soliton complexes @xcite and domain walls @xcite , have also been studied .",
    "on the other hand , as indicated above , one of the most attractive traits of such ultracold systems is the possibility of experimental realization of different potentials . among them , one that has drawn considerable attention due to its fundamental nature is the double - well potential .",
    "one of the prototypical realizations thereof comes from combining a strong harmonic trap with a periodic lattice @xcite . in this context",
    ", the study of becs loaded in double well potentials allows for the investigation of a variety of fundamental phenomena , including josephson oscillations and tunneling for a small number of atoms , or macroscopic quantum self - trapping and an asymmetric partition of the atoms between the wells for sufficiently large numbers of atoms @xcite .",
    "double well potentials have also spurred numerous theoretical insights including , among others , finite - mode reductions , analytical results for specially designed shapes of the potential and quantum depletion effects @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that such potentials have also been studied in the context of nonlinear optics , with relevant experimental results appearing , e.g. , in twin - core self - guided laser beams in kerr media @xcite and optically induced dual - core waveguiding structures in photorefractive crystals @xcite .",
    "the principal scope of the present work is to combine these two interesting developments , namely to examine spinor becs in the presence of double well potentials .",
    "in particular , our aim is to present a systematic classification of the states that are possible for @xmath0 spinor condensates confined in a double well potential .",
    "this classification is formulated on the basis of a two - mode galerkin - type approximation of the stationary states of the system , which involves the decomposition of the spatial part of the solutions into a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the underlying linear operator ; the relevant two - mode reduction used here is in the spirit of galerkin truncations in finite element and similar methods ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "such an approach can provide a detailed analytical handle on the dynamics of this multi - component bec system ( see , e.g. , the earlier work on one - component @xcite and two - component becs @xcite in double well potentials ) . it should be noted here that such attempts have been made before , most notably in refs . @xcite and @xcite : the first of these works examined magnetization oscillations and beats among other dynamical states , while the second one ( which provided a description beyond mean - field theory ) examined quantum entanglement and pseudo - spin - squeezing properties .",
    "however , these works were constrained within the commonly used _ single mode approximation _ ( sma ) for spinor condensates ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in which the wavefunction of each of the three components is taken to be a time - dependent multiple of a single stationary state .",
    "one of the particularly interesting features in the present setting is that the two - mode galerkin - type approximation reveals a considerable wealth of states , many of which can not be described in the framework of sma . in particular , as we will see below , there is a multitude of states which are symmetric in some of the components , while they are anti - symmetric in others , and out of these states also bifurcate further states which are asymmetric ( but often in a non - single - mode way ) in the different components .",
    "many of these novel states have a good chance to be observed in experiments with quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) spinor becs since , by performing their linear stability analysis , we find them to be stable .",
    "finally , we examine the dynamical evolution of both two - component and three - component states that we find to be unstable ; we observe that the manifestation of the associated instabilities is exhibited typically through symmetry - breaking between the components and is also associated with recurring asymmetric patterns .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the model , and provide the analytical approach . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "in particular , we obtain the complete bifurcation diagram of the possible stationary states , both for the full three - component system , as well as for the two - mode galerkin - type approximation ( in very good agreement between the two ) . in that section",
    ", we also illustrate the spatial profiles of the nonlinear modes arising in the spinor condensate and quantify their stability .",
    "lastly , we corroborate these stability predictions by performing dynamical simulations of the unstable modes . finally , in section 4 , we summarize our findings and present our conclusions , as well as some topics for future study .",
    "in the framework of mean - field theory , the wavefunctions @xmath3 of the three hyperfine components ( @xmath4 ) of a quasi-1d spinor @xmath0 condensate is governed by the following system of coupled normalized gp equations @xcite : @xmath5 in these expressions @xmath6 represents the total normalized density , while the coupling coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent , respectively , the symmetric spin - independent and the antisymmetric spin - dependent interaction strengths ( see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .",
    "additionally , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) represents the single - particle operator with a confining potential @xmath11 assumed to be of the form @xmath12 this is a double well potential consisting of a parabolic potential of strength @xmath13 emulating , e.g. , a usual harmonic trap , and a localized barrier potential of strength @xmath14 and width @xmath15 , representing , e.g. , a blue - detuned laser beam that repels atoms from the harmonic trap center . notice that the main qualitative features of our results ( i.e. , the nature of the bifurcation diagram near the linear limit , the emergence of the symmetry - breaking asymmetric states , and their dynamical manifestations ) do not rely on the specific form of the double well potential and should be expected to arise more broadly within this class of models ( spinor condensates in double well potentials ) .",

    "in this work , we considered the statics and dynamics of a @xmath0 spinor condensate confined in a double well potential .",
    "we illustrated that the two - mode galerkin - type approximation , previously developed for one - component @xcite and two - component @xcite settings can be extended to this genuinely three - component setting .",
    "the advantage of such a methodology is that it can offer considerable insight on the full set of stationary states that the system can exhibit , not only as pure states involving one - component , or two - component combinations ( involving the @xmath123 and @xmath113 components ) , but even fully three - component spinorial states .",
    "an additional strength of the method is that it does not rely on the single mode approximation ( sma ) that necessitates the same spatial profile among all the hyperfine components , but rather it permits to fully explore non - sma states that the system clearly and abundantly possesses .",
    "in fact , most of these states are observed to be dynamically stable in at least a fraction of parameter space of their existence ( i.e. , effectively for appropriate atom numbers ) and hence should be accessible to relevant experiments with spinor condensates in double well potentials .",
    "we have observed that the two - mode galerkin - type approximation is very efficient in unraveling the full bifurcation diagram of the possible states .",
    "finally , we have illustrated the dynamics of either two - component or three - component spinorial states in direct simulations , observing typically the emergence of the symmetry breaking instability , leading to a stronger population of one or the other well , and subsequent recurrence of such asymmetric patterns .",

    "<S> this way , we are able to obtain not only earlier results based on the _ single mode approximation _ ( sma ) frequently used in studies of spinor becs , but also additional modes that involve either two or all three spinor components of the @xmath0 spinor bec . </S>",
    "<S> the results based on this galerkin - type decomposition are in good agreement with the analysis of the full system . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently analyze the stability of these multi - component states , as well as their dynamics when we find them to be unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the instabilities of the symmetric or anti - symmetric states exhibit symmetry - breaking and recurrent asymmetric patterns . </S>",
    "<S> our results yield qualitatively similar bifurcation diagrams both for polar ( such as @xmath1na ) and ferromagnetic ( such as @xmath2rb ) spinor becs . </S>"
