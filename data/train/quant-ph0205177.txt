    "in 1921 , kaluza @xcite proposed a five dimensional ( 5d ) geometrical framework for the unification of the gravitational and the electromagnetic interactions . following the model of the 4d general relativity ,",
    "kaluza discussed both the field equations and the particle propagation along 5d time - like geodesics , trying to establish the role of the fifth dimension for the traditional 4d physics .",
    "kaluza @xcite proposed that the fifth dimension be proportional to electric charge .",
    "several years later , klein studied quantum aspects of the 5d propagation @xcite , and noticed that the assumption of a compact and planckian fifth dimension leads to the quantization of electric charge , while addressing the question of why the fifth dimension is not experimentally observable @xcite .",
    "the kaluza - klein approach to the field theory has later been devoted an extensive amount of literature @xcite ; not the same has happened to the theory of the 5d particle propagation , in spite of its fundamental importance .",
    "in fact , kaluza @xcite immediately recognized that his 5d particle propagation theory can not apply to the electron and other elementary particles @xcite . in 1984 , gegenberg and kunstatter @xcite were led to the conclusion that , indeed , it is seemingly impossible to naturally describe the propagation of charged light particles ( i.e. , with rest mass less than the planck mass ) within a classical or quantum 5d kaluza - klein framework . in string",
    "theory this problem seems solved by giving up the concept of point particle . here",
    "we ask ourselves whether this problem is deeply rooted in the kaluza - klein interpretation of the 5d geometry , and search for alternatives .    in the attempt to construct a _ scale - invariant gravity _ , wesson @xcite proposed an interpretation of a 5d geometry where the fifth dimension , not necessarily compact , is proportional to mass ( i.e. , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the newton constant , and @xmath2 is the velocity of light ) .",
    "this idea is known in the literature as _ kaluza - klein gravity_. investigating 5d time - like geodesics in this new framework , wesson was led to predict the existence of an exotic fifth force , yet to be discovered experimentally .",
    "recently , seahra and wesson @xcite approached the problem of the anomalous fifth force for null geodesics .",
    "their study is limited to 5d manifolds with metrics conformally conjugated to that of the kaluza - klein theory in the absence of electromagnetic fields .",
    "[ however , they do not require the fifth dimension be compact .",
    "] furthermore , the metric depends on the fifth coordinate _",
    "exclusively _ through the conformal factor @xcite which is required to depend _ only _ on the fifth coordinate",
    ". then , writing the 4d _ on - shell _ constraint @xmath3 [ @xmath4 , and the 4d metric is @xmath5 as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 , inspired seahra and wesson to pursue and demonstrate the idea that a 5d massless particle propagating along a 5d null geodesic can be seen as a 4d massive particle propagating along a 4d time - like geodesic .",
    "then , they show that for the 5d null geodesic propagation , the anomalous fifth force can be removed by a reparametrization , which in turn introduces ambiguities in defining the 4d proper time of the corresponding 4d time - like geodesic .",
    "thus , it seems that seahra and wesson have found an appropriate , anomaly - free 4d interpretation of the 5d null geodesics in the absence of electromagnetic fields ( and imposing other constraints mentioned above ) .",
    "however , a close look to their theory , reveals several consistency problems .",
    "first , the fact that the fifth dimension is proportional to mass is inconsistent with the 5d interpretation of the on - shell constraint .",
    "consider the simple case of a 5d massless particle following a null geodesic in a flat , minkovski - like 5d metric .",
    "assume that the particle has constant 4d mass .",
    "by the interpretation of the fifth dimension , the particle is moving in a hyperplane of constant @xmath9 . by the interpretation of the 4d on - shell constraint ,",
    "the particle has constant momentum along the fifth dimension , and thus , unless @xmath10 ( i.e. , @xmath11 , or the particle is a 4d photon ) , the fifth coordinate changes with time .",
    "second , choosing a particular proper time for the 5d null geodesics as seen in four dimensions breaks 5d covariance , and this is inconsistent with the claim of a 5d gravity . while it is remarkable that 5d null geodesics can be regarded as 4d time - like geodesics , it is not clear _ why _ an observer would use such an interpretation .",
    "+ in the attempt to find the proper relation between the 4d and the 5d particle propagation , this paper discusses a new interpretation of the 5d space - time geometry .",
    "we give a new 4d interpretation to 5d null propagation , and we apply it to the case of weak fields .",
    "to address the propagation problem in the presence of electromagnetic fields , in both classical and quantum regimes , we equip the 5d geometry with a quantum principle for 5d spinless and massless particle propagation .",
    "the geodesic propagation is then obtained by taking the classical limit .",
    "an important idea for our work is the distinction between _ active _ , _ pasive _ and _ inertial _ mass @xcite . in short , active",
    "mass is the source of gravitational field , and passive mass is the object the gravitational field acts upon @xcite .",
    "we adopt the equivalence principle of general relativity which identifies the inertial and the passive mass .",
    "the equivalence between the passive and the active mass is required by the action - reaction principle of newtonian mechanics . in general relativity",
    ", we may consider the active and the passive mass as distinct concepts , whose comparison is not necessarily meaningful @xcite .",
    "we also distinguish active and passive electric charge .",
    "another important concept for our work is that of path integral introduced to physics by feynman @xcite in 1948 . here",
    "we consider path integrals to be coordinate - free quantities . given two points 1 and 2 in a space - time manifold , a sum over all paths from 1 to 2 depends on the choice of the points 1 and 2 , but it is independent of coordinates .",
    "however , in the practice of calculating path integrals , global coordinates as a consistent labeling of all points in the space - time manifold are extremely useful . in 4d quantum physics , path integrals are now very powerful tools .",
    "feynman @xcite rewrote the quantum principles of 4d quantum and statistical mechanics in the same language of path integrals . in this paper , we implement a 5d path integral quantum principle to describe the massless and spinless 5d propagation .",
    "we then show that 4d quantum and statistical mechanics can emerge as different particular interpretations of the 5d geometry endowed with this feynman quantum principle . thus ,",
    "in five dimensions , we obtain not only the unification of electromagnetic and gravitational interactions , but also a unification of 4d quantum and 4d statistical mechanics .",
    "perhaps , this is not surprising given that 4d mechanics and 4d statistics have been developing now for many decades side by side , borrowing each other ideas and formalism both in the quantum mechanical and in the quantum field theoretical frameworks , and being just a wick rotation away .",
    "+ we start with a 5d space - time having a space - like fifth dimension .",
    "we do not request the fifth dimension be compact , and , in 5d context , we do not restrict the transformations of coordinates to be cylindrical [ i.e. , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "thus , in principle , the fifth dimension is observable both in the field equations and particle propagation .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to discuss how the fifth dimension is revealed to an electrically uncharged 4d observer that perceives geometrically only the first four dimensions , but not the fifth . in four dimensions ,",
    "the fifth dimension is not manifested as a geometrical entity , but rather through its consequences .",
    "consider the situation where a 5d spinless and massless quantum particle , called a _ 5d photon _ , propagates in a 5d curved space - time .",
    "we formulate the setup of the propagation problem introducing a path integral quantum principle .",
    "_ a zero rest mass particle is created at a point 1 of a 5d space - time with fixed metric , and then annihilated at a point 2 in the future cone of 1 .",
    "we assume that the existence of this particle does not alter the space - time geometry .",
    "maximal information on the particle s quantum propagation is obtained from the number of all null paths between points 1 and 2 .",
    "_ we call this setup _ 5d quantum optics_. we discuss breaking of 5d covariance when a 4d observer measures a 5d photon and assigns it a 4d physical picture for 5d metrics independent of some coordinates . in the case of translational symmetry along the fifth coordinate ,",
    "our procedure has formal similarities to the traditional kaluza - klein dimensional reduction .",
    "in contrast , the spontaneous compactification of string theory is a proper physical phenomenon ; a macroscopic observer detects all 11 ( or 10 ) dimensions of the space - time up to quantum effects due to the small diameters of the compact dimensions .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we proceed with presenting the general case of the 5d quantum optics ( sec .",
    "[ sec : qoptics ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : qm ] , we introduce the particular situation where the 5d metric is independent of the fifth space - like coordinate .",
    "we first shortly discuss the field equations .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : mcanqm ] ,",
    "we show that the 5d null path integral is equivalent to a 4d path integral over time - like paths with specified length .",
    "thus , we construct a microcanonical ensemble for our 4d quantum mechanics from the microcanonical ensemble of the 5d quantum optics . in sec .",
    "[ sec : canqm ] we introduce the corresponding 4d canonical ensemble @xcite .",
    "then , we make the connection between the nonrelativistic limit of our formulation of quantum mechanics and feynman s . we conclude that our quantum mechanics is anomaly - free and equivalent to the traditional feyman formulation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sm ] , we investigate another particular case of the 5d quantum optics which we interpret as a formulation of statistical mechanics .",
    "the state of thermal equilibrium implies that macroscopic observables do not change in time .",
    "presumably , this can be achieved for a 5d metric which is time - independent . in this case , we reformulate the 5d quantum optics as a statistical mechanics for a single spinless particle which belongs to an ensemble of non - interacting particles .",
    "it seems unavoidable that our path integral formulation of statistical mechanics needs the ergodic principle in order to establish relations with experiment .",
    "also , our statistical mechanics describes only ensembles of discernable particles , unless correction factors are introduced ` by hand ' .",
    "if the 5d metric is independent of both time and the fifth coordinate , quantum and statistical mechanics make different pictures of the same 5d reality . in sec .",
    "[ sec : kg ] , we present how the klein - gordon equation appears from the 5d formalism .",

    "we assume that @xmath16 does not depend on @xmath9 and foliate the 5d space - time along the fifth coordinate .",
