    "the d0 collaboration , with 6.1 fb@xmath2 of data , has recently reported evidence for an anomalously large cp violation in the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry @xcite which is attributed to semileptonic decays of @xmath3 hadrons defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of events with two @xmath3 hadrons ( @xmath6 ) decaying semileptonically into @xmath7 .",
    "the d0 result @xcite , @xmath8 with the first error being statistical and the second systematic , is 3.2@xmath9 away from the standard model ( sm ) prediction of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 is related to the asymmetries @xmath12 in @xmath13 and @xmath14 decays by @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 stand for the fragmentation fractions for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . using known values of @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",

    "using the current experimental value @xcite @xmath31 which is consistent with zero and also with the sm prediction @xcite @xmath32 within errors , one requires @xcite @xmath33 to obtain the d0 value of @xmath34 .",

    "using only 1.6 fb@xmath2 of data , has a central value which is positive , @xmath37 , but is still compatible with the d0 measurement at the 1.5@xmath9 level because its uncertainties are 4 times larger than those of d0 . combining in quadrature ( including the systematic errors ) the d0 and cdf results for @xmath11",
    ", one finds @xmath38 which is still 3@xmath9 away from the sm value .",
    "d0 @xcite also performed a direct measurement of @xmath36 , but the result does not show any deviation from the sm , although the error bars are quite large : @xmath39 .",
    "this value is much smaller than the one given in eq .",
    "( [ as - d0 ] )",
    ". we could combine all these results to obtain an average value @xmath40 .",
    "even though the inclusion of the cdf dimuon asymmetry and the d0 semileptonic wrong - charge asymmetry reduces the deviation in @xmath41 derived from the d0 dimuon asymmetry , the above result is still about 2.5@xmath9 away from the sm value @xcite of @xmath42 .",
    "if confirmed , it is an indication of new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "several theoretical attempts to explain the data have been made @xcite .",
    "we note that there could be charm contamination .",
    "it is known that there is @xmath43 mixing , and this will modify the asymmetry measured by d0 unless @xmath44 mesons are completely eliminated as a possible source of muons in their data sample . to take this contamination into account one would add terms proportional to @xmath45 , related to charm contribution , to the formula in eq .",
    "( [ as ] ) .",
    "here @xmath46 is analogous to @xmath47 and is determined by the @xmath48 mixing parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the fraction of direct @xmath52 and @xmath53 production in @xmath54 collisions . using current values @xcite of @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath43 mixing , the factor @xmath46 can be determined . with the central values",
    "we obtain @xmath57 , which is a large number . in order to obtain a reliable result ,",
    "the parameter @xmath51 should be carefully evaluated for the muon selection criteria . with a non - zero @xmath51 , and small cp violation in @xmath48 mixing ,",
    "the asymmetry will be diluted making the deviation from the sm even more severe .",
    "the required value for @xmath36 is much larger than the sm prediction . attributing the observed excess to a contribution from @xmath58 mixing",

    "is given by @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 and the phase @xmath61 are defined by , @xmath62 .",
    "we adopt the phase convention that @xmath63 is real .",
    "since the sm prediction for @xmath64 agrees with data well , @xmath65 is only allowed to vary in a limited region , @xmath66 fixed by the experimental value @xcite @xmath67 and the sm prediction @xcite @xmath68 . in order to reproduce the d0 result , it would seem naively that @xmath69 would have to exceed the physical range @xmath70 , as one needs @xmath71 .",
    "this situation calls for a more careful analysis considering @xmath61 and @xmath65 simultaneously . here",
    "we wish to point out that eq .",
    "( [ as - f ] ) is only an approximation , and we now review the derivation of the exact formula for the asymmetry .    denoting the element in the hamiltonian responsible for @xmath58 mixing by @xmath72 , and working in a basis where @xmath73 is positive real , one can write the same element as @xmath74 ( this is equivalent to defining @xmath75 ) . we have @xmath76 note that the above definitions of @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the same as those in ref . @xcite .    further defining @xmath79 , and @xmath80",

    "( [ as - f ] ) .",
    "a careful expansion of @xmath36 in terms of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , reveals that @xmath90 note that the asymmetry can be as large as order one for fixed @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    in the sm ,",
    "the phase in @xmath91 is @xcite @xmath92 which is too small to play a substantial role in explaining the large asymmetry observed .",
    "new physics beyond the sm may induce large cp violating phases and also change the magnitudes for both @xmath93 and @xmath63 .",
    "we now consider the constraints on the new physics contribution to @xmath94 assuming that there is no alteration to the sm prediction for @xmath63 .",
    "defining @xmath95 and neglecting the small phase in @xmath91 , we can solve for @xmath69 and @xmath60 , @xmath96 whether there are physical solutions for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , should be analyzed using the above equations with the constraints for @xmath99 and @xmath65 in the ranges @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .    in fig.1",
    "we show the ranges for @xmath65 and @xmath97 for a given value of @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) as a function of @xmath104 .",
    "since d0 data requires that the asymmetry @xmath36 be negative , this restricts @xmath105 to be negative too .",
    "one can then see in which quadrant should @xmath98 be in order to reproduce the data . to obtain a large size for @xmath106 , a lower value of @xmath65 is preferred , therefore the solution with @xmath107 is preferred .    from the figures ,",
    "we see that it is not possible for @xmath106 to get down to the central value @xmath108 as this would require a value for @xmath65 below its one sigma lower bound .",
    "we have checked that in order to have solution within the one @xmath9 region of @xmath65 , @xmath106 can at most go down to -1.6 . to have @xmath106 reach the d0 central value it is also necessary to modify @xmath63 .",
    "the analysis , in general , will now be different @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath109 is much larger than @xmath110 , the change of @xmath63 needed can be easily accommodated in eq .",
    "( [ as - f ] ) by multiplying by a factor @xmath111 and modifying the phase @xmath61 to include the contribution from @xmath63 .",
    "the value for @xmath36 is then scaled by a factor @xmath112 .",
    "the central value of the d0 asymmetry is then obtained with @xmath112 around 1.6 , which is allowed by the experimental data on @xmath78 .",
    "it should be noted that the usually quoted value for @xmath63 is from short distance sm contribution @xcite , there may be long distance contributions which modify the value .",
    "a larger than sm short distance contribution to @xmath63 is still a possibility .",
    "however , it is difficult to reliably calculate the long distance contribution .",
    "it is also possible that a large @xmath63 is due to new physics beyond the sm @xcite .     and",

    "this implies that @xmath63 is a factor of 3 larger than the usual sm short distance contribution .",
    "in order to reproduce the anomalously large dimuon asymmetry observed by d0 , new physics beyond the sm is needed .",
    "there are different ways in which the dimuon asymmetry in @xmath58 can be affected .",
    "for example @xmath118 models with tree level fcnc @xcite can easily induce a large modification for @xmath119 , but have little effect on @xmath63 .",
    "r - parity violating interactions in susy models can also have tree level fcnc . besides modifying @xmath119",
    ", they can induce modifications in @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "however , taking into account new constraints from various experimental data @xcite , it is difficult to generate sizeable modifications in @xmath120  . in the following we discuss these two types of models and their contributions to @xmath121 and @xmath63 , taking into account constraints from other possible data , in some detail .      in general",
    "a @xmath1 can couple to quarks with fcnc of the form @xcite @xmath122 in @xmath1 models , the new contributions to @xmath121 happen at tree - level , whereas the modification of @xmath63 only occurs at the loop level and is therefore a smaller effect .",
    "we will concentrate on the tree level @xmath1 exchange contribution to @xmath121 with constraints on the parameters from other processes @xcite .",
    "we begin from the known contribution to @xmath123 from @xmath118 exchange @xcite , @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a qcd correction resulting from the running scale from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath128 is the ratio between the matrix element @xmath129 and its value in factorization .",
    "similarly , @xmath130 is defined as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the ratio between the matrix element @xmath133 and its value in factorization .",
    "when needed , we will use @xmath134 in our numerical results .    using the central value from lattice calculation @xcite @xmath135 mev",
    ", we obtain @xmath136    to make sure that there are solutions for the required value of @xmath36 determined from d0 data , we take a case with @xmath137 for illustration . in this case",
    "we have @xmath138    as we have discussed earlier , within the one @xmath9 allowed region for @xmath65 it is not possible to obtain the d0 central value for @xmath36 . to illustrate the range of @xmath36 that can be obtained with this model",
    ", we consider a few specific values of @xmath139 and restrict @xmath65 to be within its one @xmath9 allowed region .",
    "a solution with an asymmetry within one @xmath9 of the d0 result requires @xmath106 to be less than -1.4 . for illustration",
    "we take @xmath140 ( corresponding to @xmath36 in the range of @xmath141 ) . with @xmath142 , @xmath105",
    "is restricted to be in the range @xmath143 and the corresponding range for @xmath97 is @xmath144 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "if the large asymmetry observed by d0 is confirmed , the new physics parameters @xmath97 and @xmath105 need to be in the above ranges . however , if it turns out that the asymmetry is smaller , one needs to use a smaller @xmath106 , in which case solutions are much easier to obtain .",
    "we will concentrate on the case with @xmath145 . applying the above ranges of parameters to eq .",
    "( [ xy ] ) , we then have @xmath146 this range is comparable to other constrains on fcnc from non - universal @xmath118 models @xcite , and in particular admits solutions with small @xmath147 , say of @xmath148 .",
    "we note that @xmath118 couplings to @xmath149 quarks has very weak constraints from the decays @xmath150 and @xmath151 which are much lower than values used above . in this case",
    "the @xmath1 mass can be in the several hundreds of gev , a region that can be studied at the lhc .",
    "we note that models with natural suppression of flavor changing couplings exist in the literature @xcite .",
    "the case with @xmath152 is the same as the case discussed above , but with @xmath153 replaced by @xmath154 . if both @xmath153 and @xmath154 are non - zero , the analysis is more complicated .",
    "for example , for the special case with @xmath155 the contribution from @xmath1 exchange to @xmath97 is reduced by a factor of 0.6 .",
    "this translates into the coupling , @xmath155 , being enhanced by a factor @xmath156 and the phase range being the same as in the @xmath157 case .",
    "we now discuss an example which can modify @xmath63 , an r - parity violating ( rpv ) interaction in susy models .",
    "however , we find that existing constraints @xcite will limit the effect to levels below what is required to explain the d0 data .    there are three types of @xmath97-parity violating terms @xcite : @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 . here",
    "@xmath161 and @xmath162 are the generation indices : @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the left handed lepton , quark , right handed lepton , down - quark and up - quark fields , respective .",
    "@xmath165 indicates the charge conjugated field of @xmath166 the contributions of these interactions to @xmath167 have been studied in detail @xcite .",
    "it is found that these interactions can induce a non - zero @xmath121 at tree level .",
    "there are also couplings that can induce a non - zero @xmath63 at one loop level without tree level contributions to @xmath93 .",
    "the contributions to @xmath84 can be grouped into several categories according to particles exchanged @xcite . for @xmath168 couplings , these contributions are : @xmath169 from interference between sm and r - parity violating interactions ; @xmath170 from exchanges of neutrinos and down - type squarks ; @xmath171 from exchanges of charged leptons and up - type squarks ; @xmath172 from exchanges of light up - type quarks and charged sleptons ; and @xmath173 from exchanges of light down - type quarks and sneutrinos . for @xmath174 couplings ,",
    "the contributions are : @xmath169 from interference between sm and r - parity violating interactions ; @xmath175 from exchanges of up - type light quarks and down - type squarks ; and @xmath173 from exchanges of down - type light quarks and up - type squarks .",
    "although the couplings involved do not contribute to @xmath58 mixing at tree level , they contribute to various @xmath176 decays , such as @xmath177 and @xmath178 ( where @xmath179 is a light pseudoscalar meson ) . after applying these constraints ,",
    "the most likely large contributions are given by @xmath180    the constraints on these couplings that arise from @xmath176 decays , assuming sparticles with mass 100 gev , are @xcite , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 .",
    "these numbers constrain the three contributions in eq .",
    "[ eq : bs1 ] to be less than 0.06 , 0.03 and 0.03 , respectively .",
    "all of them are smaller by factors of 3 - 5 than the @xmath184 required to explain the d0 asymmetry .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that all these contributions ( plus the sm ) add up constructively to reach the value required by d0 data , but at this stage it is fair to conclude that this is not a favored explanation .",
    "finally , we comment on the cp asymmetry @xmath186 which can be measured by studying the time dependent @xmath187 and @xmath188 decay rate difference , @xmath189 where @xmath190 is not a cp eigenstate .",
    "the notation follows ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath191 in this equation , @xmath192 and @xmath193 are time dependent decay amplitudes for @xmath14 and @xmath194 decay into states @xmath190 and @xmath195 in terms of the @xmath14 mixing parameters @xmath196    assuming that cp violation in @xmath197 and @xmath198 is small , @xmath199    if @xmath200 , which is a very good approximation for @xmath13 decays , it is not possible to study the quantity @xmath201 in totality . the time dependence is a simple sine function of time and one can not check the @xmath185 effect .",
    "therefore this cp violating observable is special to @xmath202 system because @xmath78 is not zero .",
    "it offers a possibility to study the exponential factor in the time dependence . in the sm",
    "the phase @xmath61 is small @xcite , @xmath92 , resulting in a very small @xmath186 .",
    "if the d0 result is confirmed however , a large phase is allowed as we saw earlier and a large @xmath186 is possible . in fig([quantf ] ) , we show @xmath203 as a function of t. we have chosen the value @xmath204 with the phase in the third quadrant and the central value @xmath205 for illustration .",
    "we can see that at the few percent level , there are differences with respect to the @xmath206 case , and such differences may be tested at the lhcb or at a b - factory , such as belle ii with sufficient high energy to produce @xmath207 pairs .     vs. t(ps ) with @xmath208 and @xmath107 .",
    "[ quantf],width=240 ]",
    "the dimuon asymmetry reported by d0 is much larger than the sm prediction although further experimental studies are needed to confirm this result .",
    "@xmath43 mixing may contaminate the final results and it is therefore important to carry out a detailed study with careful selection criteria for the dimuon events . if the d0 result is confirmed , it represents clear evidence for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "if new physics only affects @xmath121 , we can get an asymmetry within one @xmath9 of the d0 value , but it is not possible to reach the central value .",
    "modification of @xmath63 by new physics may then play an important role .",
    "we studied the consequences of the d0 dimuon asymmetry on a @xmath118 model with tree level fcnc and in a susy model with r - parity violating interactions .",
    "we find that the exchange of @xmath1 can significantly modify @xmath121 and bring the theoretical prediction to within one @xmath9 of the d0 allowed region .",
    "we showed that there are r - parity violating terms which can modify @xmath63 but that these modifications are probably too small to account for the observed d0 asymmetry .",
    "we also showed that the d0 result implies a large effect on time dependent cp violation in @xmath202 mixing resulting in a detectable non - zero @xmath78 effect at the lhcb .",
