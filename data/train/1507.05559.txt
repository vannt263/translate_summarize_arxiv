    "the group of @xmath0bootis stars stand out among the chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars of the upper main - sequence .",
    "the cp stars normally exhibit strong overabundances of elements , probably caused by magnetic fields , slow rotation or atmospheric diffusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the @xmath0bootis stars are a small group ( only 2per cent ) of late - b to early - f stars that show moderate to extreme ( surface ) underabundances ( up to a factor 100 ) of most fe - peak elements , but solar abundances of lighter elements ( c , n , o and s )",
    ". several members of the group exhibit a strong infrared excess , and a disk @xcite .    to explain the peculiar chemical abundances , @xcite suggested they are caused by selective accretion of circumstellar material .",
    "one of the principal features of that hypothesis is that the observed abundance anomalies are restricted to the stellar surface . on the basis of this hypothesis @xcite and @xcite developed models which describe the interaction of the star with its local interstellar and/or circumstellar environment , whereby different degrees of underabundance are produced by different amounts of accreted material relative to the photospheric mass .",
    "the fact that the fraction of @xmath0bootis stars on the main - sequence is so small would then be a consequence of the low probability of a star - cloud interaction within a limited parameter space .",
    "for example , the effects of meridional circulation dissolves any accretion pattern a few million years after the accretion has stopped .    since the early 1990s",
    ", the pulsational behaviour of the group members was extensively studied because almost all @xmath0bootis stars are located within the classical @xmath1scuti/@xmath2doradus instability strip @xcite .",
    "it was deduced that at least 70per cent of the group members inside the classical instability strip pulsate .",
    "they do so with first and second overtones modes ( q@xmath30.020d ) typical for @xmath1scuti type pulsators",
    ". only a few stars , if any , pulsate in the fundamental mode . in general , the amplitudes do not exceed a few mmags .",
    "the period - luminosity - colour relation for this group is , within the errors , identical to that of the normal @xmath1scuti stars @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have selected fifteen targets from the 66 @xmath0bootis stars in the lists of @xcite and @xcite which have at least 1000 data points in the wide angle search for planets ( wasp ) archive and are fainter than @xmath4=8mag to avoid the effects of saturation .",
    "we analysed the time series of these fifteen group members to search for variability and compared our result with those in the literature .",

    "the low - frequency instability border at about @xmath23@xmath107d@xmath13 is almost insensitive to the metallicity , but the high - frequency border depends strongly on [ z ] . because the interaction of convection and pulsation are not well described in the present theory , the true position of the high - frequency instability border is quite uncertain .",
    "a higher value of the initial hydrogen content slightly increases the instability of high - frequency modes .",
    "it is due to the fact that high - frequency modes are partially driven through the h - ionization zone .",
    "high - frequency modes have an increase of the work integral near the h opacity bump .",
    "since convection transports almost the entire energy in this zone , this pulsation driving effect can be artificial .",

    "the change of this parameter to 1.0 did not cause a significant effect .    in this regime",
    ", there are quite strong effects of the chosen @xmath24 and  values .",
    "the instability of modes depends quite strongly on the exact position of a star on the hrd . for a given [ z ] ,",
    "a higher effective temperature gives instability for higher frequencies .",
    "the low - frequency instability border is shifted to about 9d@xmath13 . for cooler models , we derived instability for lower frequencies , but high - frequency modes were slightly more stable .",
    "more luminous models could not explain the instability of high - frequency modes , while less luminous ones have problems with low - frequency modes .",
    "this is interesting because the lowest frequencies were found for hd120896 , which is the least luminous star .",
    "but its effective temperature is also lower than for the remaining stars , and this effect should cancel the luminosity effect .",
    "the theoretical evolutionary changes of frequencies are of order of @xmath25d@xmath13yr@xmath13 , which are too small to detect with the current data .",
    "we conclude that with the frequencies found in this work we are not able to reject the possibility that the stars are beyond the main - sequence .",
    "both low and high metallicities are possible because the instability of modes depends mainly on the helium ionization zone .",
    "we analysed the time series of wasp datasets of 15 well established @xmath0bootis stars .",
    "this small group of chemically peculiar objects of the upper main - sequence is an excellent target to investigate the effects of diffusion , rotation , and accretion in the presence of classical @xmath1scuti/@xmath2doradus type pulsation .    for eight targets",
    ", we were able to detect ( multiperiodic ) variations with amplitudes between 1.6 and 35.1mmag .",
    "four of the probable constant stars are not located in the instability strip .",
    "a comparison of our results with those from the literature yields an excellent agreement .",
    "we made an asteroseismic analysis of the multiperiodic stars to tackle the question as to whether the chemical peculiarity is intrinsic or restricted to the stellar surface .",
    "for this , we estimated the metallicities and projected rotational velocities from high - resolution archival spectra .",
    "we then used state - of - the - art pulsation models to characterize the ( in)stability properties . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that if the stars are still on the main - sequence , which is the most accepted hypothesis @xcite , they are not intrinsically metal - weak .",
    "if they are beyond the terminal - age main - sequence , the results are ambiguous .",
    "we suggest detailed spectroscopic follow - up observations of the presented multiperiodic @xmath0bootis stars to identify individual modes .",
    "such spectroscopic observations have been already successfully performed for one member of the group , 29  cygni , by @xcite .",
    "similar studies for @xmath1 scuti stars of comparable magnitudes have been published @xcite proving the feasibility .",
    "the expected high precision parallaxes and thus distances as well as luminosities from the gaia satellite mission @xcite will hopefully significantly improve the accuracy of the position of the investigated stars in the hrd .",
    "at least for those which are not too bright .",
