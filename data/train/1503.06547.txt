    "optomechanical systems in the quantum regime are very important for quantum information processing and for testing fundamental issues of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "their theoretical analysis therefore calls for a first principle description . in particular",
    "since the focus is on quantum effects , the theoretical models must be fully consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "actually the correct quantum description of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator and of the thermal noise affecting it is not a trivial task , and there is not a unique accepted model for them @xcite .",
    "the first aim of this paper is therefore to obtain an accurate quantum mechanical description of a mechanical oscillator taken to be part of an opto - mechanical device .",
    "the oscillator can not be considered as a brownian particle , but rather as a mesoscopic mechanical system , say a movable mirror mounted on a vibrating structure .",
    "dissipative effects are essentially due to the interaction with phonons",
    ". our strategy will be to introduce reasonable physical requirements leading to a master equation in lindblad form , valid for any temperature of the thermal bath .",
    "we then translate these results into quantum langevin equations and we show how to obtain a suitable non - markovian generalization at this level of description . relying on these results we can consider the description of the simplest optomechanical system , that is a moving mirror interacting with an electromagnetic mode in a cavity via radiation pressure @xcite . again a suitable analysis of the composite system and of the monitoring of the emitted light calls for a consistent quantum description .",
    "we shall obtain this result by the use of quantum langevin equations , directly deducing them from a unitary dynamics , and exploiting the theory of measurements in continuous time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in we",
    "determine the reduced dynamics of the mechanical oscillator . here , the basic assumption is the use of a markovian master equation with a quadratic generator and having a unique equilibrium state .",
    "its structure is further determined by suitable symmetry requirements and by physical constraints on the behaviour of the mean values of position and momentum . in",
    "we introduce the quantum langevin equations for the mechanical oscillator alone ; the whole presentation is based on the notions of quantum noise @xcite and of input - output fields @xcite , as well as on the use of quantum stochastic calculus @xcite .",
    "the bose fields entering in the unitary dynamics play the role of phonon fields . by modifying their state without changing the time evolution operator it is possible to introduce non markovian effects , namely a non - flat noise spectrum .",
    "the differences with respect to usual approaches are of relevance especially at low temperatures , where the zero - point fluctuations play an essential role .",
    "a quantum optomechanical system is studied in by using the quantum langevin approach , within a fully consistent formulation valid at any temperature .",
    "firstly , the typical effect of laser cooling is discussed .",
    "then , the continuous monitoring of the emitted light is introduced in sections [ sec : homo ] ( homodyne detection ) and [ sec : hetero ] ( heterodyne detection ) .",
    "the treatment is well based in the theory of measurements in continuous time .",
    "detection of the emitted light is usually assumed to give a direct measurement of the fluctuations of the position of the mechanical component .",
    "we show that this is true , but only for not too low temperatures ; at very small temperatures , interference terms are important and the direct connection with such fluctuations is lost .",
    "this leads to new predictions on the optical spectra at very low temperature . we finally summarize and discuss our results in",
    "as a first step towards the construction of models of optomechanical systems valid in the quantum regime at low temperatures , we consider the reduced dynamics of an open mechanical oscillator",
    ". a fully consistent quantum description of a massive nanomechanical component , kept at the simplest possible level , will be our basic building block in order to consider more complex dynamics .",
    "we therefore formulate in the first instance a markovian description for the mechanical oscillator , which we build up relying on general physical constraints and symmetry requirements .    a standard approach often considered in the literature",
    "is to derive the master equation for the harmonic oscillator from effective environmental models of bosonic oscillators @xcite .",
    "however , previous work @xcite has shown that , while using careful approximations a positive markovian dynamics can be obtained in this framework , the final results are valid only from medium to high temperatures of the thermal bath . to ask for a markovian dynamics based on symmetry arguments allows to get simpler and more universal models , but again serious problems appear .",
    "the requirement that the equilibrium state should be the canonical thermal state determined by the standard hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator is known to be incompatible with positivity and translational invariance @xcite .",
    "this incompatibility induced some authors to renounce to translational invariance @xcite , or to accept non - positive dynamical equations and to give more relevance to obtaining time evolutions very close to the classical ones @xcite .",
    "a non positive dynamics can be satisfactory when the system is near the classical regime , but this approach becomes questionable when quantum effects are searched for @xcite .",
    "we shall show that it is possible to maintain positivity and translational invariance by weakening the requests on the equilibrium state .",
    "the key point will be a weak formulation of energy equipartition at equilibrium .",
    "our result is therefore to single out from the many proposals appearing in the literature a unique consistent dynamics in the markov approximation .",
    "we formulate now our assumptions , starting from the existence of a well defined positive markovian dynamics , describing damping and translationally invariant apart from the harmonic potential . a weak equipartition condition and the existence of a unique stationary state in gibbs form , as we shall see ,",
    "will essentially fix the structure of the reduced dynamics .",
    "the evolution of the statistical operator of the oscillator is governed by a markovian master equation preserving the positivity of the states .",
    "the generator of the dynamics is at most quadratic in the position and momentum operators of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "the first assumption is to consider a time - homogeneous and linear time evolution .",
    "such a dynamics can be expressed in the form @xmath1,\\ ] ] with @xmath2 a suitable generator or liouville operator , at most quadratic in the position and momentum operators of the mechanical oscillator @xmath3 and @xmath4 , so as to have at most a quadratic potential term and a friction effect proportional to the momentum of the mechanical oscillator . in the case of linear systems",
    "it is known that positivity and complete positivity of the dynamics are actually equivalent @xcite , therefore according to @xcite the generator @xmath2 must have the standard lindblad structure .",
    "the most general quadratic liouville operator is obtained in terms of two lindblad operators @xcite @xmath5 and a generic selfadjoint quadratic hamiltonian for the mechanical system @xmath6 where all the constants are taken to be real , so that @xmath2 takes the form @xmath7=-\\frac\\rmi\\hbar \\left[h_{\\mathrm{m}},\\rho\\right]+\\sum_{j=1}^2\\left(r_j\\rho r_j^{\\,\\dagger}-\\frac 1 2 \\left\\{r_j^{\\,\\dagger}r_j,\\rho\\right\\}\\right).\\ ] ]    we ask now to have a damped oscillator , but not an _ overdamped _ one .",
    "the `` kinetic energy '' term is non negative and the mean values of position and momentum decay to zero with an oscillating behaviour .    apart from the trivial requirement of a positive _ kinetic energy _",
    "term , we further look for a dynamics describing the oscillating decay of the mean values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to zero .",
    "this condition complies with the markovian and quadratic approximations , which are expected to be good only for small damping . denoting by @xmath8 the mean value of a quantum operator with the state @xmath9 solution of the master equation we have for position and momentum @xmath10 with @xmath11 the inner product in @xmath12 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the associated dynamical matrix are @xmath13 , so that in order to have an underdamped dynamics we need @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in particular @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the same sign and are non - vanishing .",
    "positivity of the kinetic energy leads to @xmath18 and therefore @xmath19 . then , we can write @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; the above inequality on @xmath22 becomes @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the vanishing of the equilibrium means imply @xmath24 , @xmath25 . introducing the positive coefficients @xmath26",
    "the generator can be written in the form @xmath27=-\\frac{\\rmi } { 2m}\\left[p,\\left\\{p,\\rho\\right\\}\\right ] -\\frac{\\rmi m{{\\omega_{\\rm m}^{\\,2}}}}2\\left[q,\\left\\{q,\\rho\\right\\}\\right]-\\frac { d_{pp}}2\\,[q,[q,\\rho ] ] -\\frac{d_{qq}}2\\,[p,[p,\\rho]]\\\\ { } -d_{qp}\\ , [ p,[q,\\rho ] ] - \\frac { \\rmi\\left(\\kappa_0 + { { \\gamma_{\\rm m}}}\\right ) } 4\\left[q,\\left\\{p,\\rho\\right\\}\\right ] -\\frac",

    "an alternative way to get the same positivity condition is to ask the _",
    "generalized _ heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath29 to hold for any time and any initial state @xcite .",
    "the first two assumptions are implicitly or explicitly taken in all the markovian approaches .",
    "a further natural requirement is that the interaction with the environment does not depend on the position of the oscillator .",
    "the reduced dynamics is invariant under translations apart from the harmonic potential term .",
    "this requirement is equivalent to the validity of the classical equations of motion for the mean values of position and momentum .    by applying the generic translation @xmath30 , @xmath31 to the generator",
    "we see that all the terms are invariant with the exclusion of the term containing the harmonic potential @xmath32 $ ] and the last term @xmath33 $ ] . therefore , the above assumption is satisfied if and only if @xmath34 . the same conclusion is reached by considering the equations of motion for position and momentum and asking them to be equivalent to the classical equations in which the momentum is proportional to the derivative of the position .",
    "the result of the first three assumptions is therefore that the liouville operator has the structure with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ; moreover , the constraints hold .",
    "in particular , the hamiltonian part of @xmath2 turns out to be @xmath37 where , besides a contribution in the form of the free hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator with a strictly positive frequency @xmath38 , one has an additional term in the form of an anticommutator proportional to the damping constant .",
    "the evolution equations for the mean values and second moments of position and momentum then read : @xmath39 @xmath40 the dynamical matrix giving the evolution of the mean values has eigenvalues @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which naturally leads to introduce the _ damped _",
    "frequency @xmath43 of the mechanical oscillator in terms of its _ bare _",
    "frequency @xmath38 : @xmath44 let us note that according to @xmath45 we have ruled out the case @xmath46 , which corresponds to a quantum brownian particle , that is a massive particle not bounded by a potential in a translation invariant environment @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .    at this stage",
    "we further have to determine the diffusion coefficients @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 appearing in .",
    "we will rely on the study of features of the equilibrium state , but to avoid the known incompatibilities with translation invariance @xcite we formulate the equipartition condition in a weaker form , not asking the existence of an equilibrium gibbs state generated by @xmath50 .",
    "at equilibrium the mean kinetic energy and the mean potential energy have to be equal .",
    "since the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix associated to have a positive real part , _ existence of a unique attractive equilibrium state _ is granted , and thanks to the linearity of the equations the equilibrium state is actually _ gaussian _ and determined by the mean values at equilibrium .",
    "then , our _ equipartition _ condition is @xmath51 which gives equal weight to the mean kinetic and potential energy at equilibrium . by setting in the time derivatives equal to zero we come to @xmath52 moreover , the second moments at equilibrium turn out to be @xmath53    we exploit finally the residual freedom we have in the choice of the diffusion coefficients to get a gibbs state as equilibrium state . however , as we already noticed , it can not be state generated by @xmath50 , and we replace it by a generic effective hamiltonian .",
    "[ as:5 ] the equilibrium state has a gibbs form which is determined by an effective hamiltonian independent from the temperature .",
    "as we shall prove below , this assumption implies that the diffusion coefficients have the expressions @xmath54 and that the equilibrium state has the form @xmath55 in these expressions , @xmath56 is the mechanical hamiltonian and @xmath57 represents the _ mean number of excitations _ in the equilibrium state , namely @xmath58    let us prove the above statements .",
    "thanks to the gaussianity of the equilibrium state , assumption [ as:5 ] means @xmath59 for a suitable quadratic hamiltonian ( without the liner terms , because the means of position and momentum have to be zero ) , say @xmath60 , with @xmath61 in order @xmath62 to be a trace - class operator .",
    "then , the eigenvalues of @xmath63 have the form @xmath64 and , without changing @xmath62 , we can redefine @xmath65 and @xmath63 in such a way that @xmath66 and @xmath67 , a positive constant which can be interpreted as the inverse temperature of the equilibrium state of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "then , the mean number of excitations has the expression . by equating the mean values determined by @xmath62 with the expressions , after some algebraic manipulations",
    "we get @xmath68 @xmath69 the right hand side of the last equation is greater or equal to 1 by and . to have @xmath63 independent from the temperature",
    "implies that the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are both proportional to @xmath70 with temperature independent coefficients .",
    "the equations above , together with @xmath66 , give the expressions and @xmath71 .      from the previous results we see that a central role is played by the mechanical hamiltonian @xmath56 , which appears in the commutator part of the liouville operator and",
    "determines the equilibrium state",
    ". it will be very useful to diagonalize explicitly @xmath56 by introducing a suitable mode operator . by defining @xmath72",

    "the inverse formulae giving @xmath76 in terms of @xmath77 are @xmath78    let us note that the form of the equilibrium state does not come from a direct requirement , but rather it follows from all the considered assumptions .",

    "<S> we provide a fully quantum description of a mechanical oscillator in the presence of thermal environmental noise by means of a quantum langevin formulation based on quantum stochastic calculus . </S>",
    "<S> the system dynamics is determined by symmetry requirements and equipartition at equilibrium , while the environment is described by quantum bose fields in a suitable non - fock representation which allows for the introduction of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a generic spectral density of the environment can be described by introducing its state through a suitable @xmath0-representation . including interaction of the mechanical oscillator with a cavity mode via radiation pressure we obtain a description of a simple optomechanical system in which , besides the langevin equations for the system , one has the exact input - output relations for the quantum noises . </S>",
    "<S> the whole theory is valid at arbitrarily low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this allows the exact calculation of the stationary value of the mean energy of the mechanical oscillator , as well as both homodyne and heterodyne spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis allows in particular to study possible cooling scenarios and to obtain the exact connection between observed spectra and fluctuation spectra of the position of the mechanical oscillator .    </S>",
