    "it is widely accepted that stars more massive than @xmath6  m@xmath7 end their life cycles as core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) . to date , the more common ccsn types ib / c and plateau type ii ( iip ) sne have been studied extensively , but the narrow - line type ii ( iin ) sne remain less well studied .",
    "such sne are identified from strong and narrow hydrogen emission lines in the spectrum , especially the prominent h@xmath8 line . for a review of sn classification ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the narrow - line features of type iin sn spectra are thought to arise from the sn ejecta interacting with an h - rich circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "recently , @xcite derived new relative rates for different sn subtypes , concluding that type iin sne make up 5 per cent of all sne in their volume - limited sample .",
    "type iin sne exhibit the most heterogeneous properties among the different ccsn subtypes .",
    "however , @xcite proposed separating a subcategory of type iin sne based on their slowly evolving narrow p cygni lines [ full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 ] , exhibited especially by the h@xmath8 line .",
    "@xcite associated these events with sne interacting with a massive csm envelope ejected in an outburst rather than in a superwind . following these authors , we identify a subclass of type iin sne consisting of events similar to sn  1994w .",

    "we show that sn  2009kn also belongs to this subclass .",

    "we present data on sn  2009kn obtained by a wide european sn collaboration comprising one of the most comprehensive data sets yet collected for this subclass of type iin sne . in section  2 , we give the basic parameters of sn  2009kn . in sections  3 and 4 , the photometric and spectroscopic data are described . in section  5 , we discuss the intrinsic nature of sn  2009kn and compare it to sn  1994w .",

    "spectroscopic observations by @xcite on november 9 revealed it to be a type iin sn based on the detection of narrow spectral balmer lines . a radio non - detection on november 27.43 ut was reported by @xcite .",
    "the recession velocity of 4931  km  s@xmath2 of mcg@xmath503 - 21 - 006 @xcite , corrected for virgo and great attractor peculiar motion @xcite , gives a heliocentric redshift @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity distance is 70.3  mpc ( h@xmath12  km  s@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and the distance modulus @xmath15  mag .",
    "the lack of pre - discovery imaging of the field of sn  2009kn close in time to the sn discovery prevents us from establishing an accurate date of explosion .",
    "however , by cross - correlating the spectra of sn  2009kn to the spectral sequence of sn  1994w , we obtain an estimate of the explosion date of jd  @xmath16 ( october 11 ) .",
    "we adopt this as the explosion date in the remainder of the paper .",
    "see section  4.2 for details and caveats on the method .",
    "the spectra of sn  2009kn show no  absorption at the host galaxy redshift .",
    "we therefore assume that the host galaxy extinction is negligible compared to the galactic component .",
    "we adopt the galactic extinction of @xmath17  mag as the extinction towards sn  2009kn ( see section  4.2 for details ) .",
