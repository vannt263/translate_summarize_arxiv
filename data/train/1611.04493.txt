    "yellow hypergiants are massive stars that have passed through the red - supergiant phase . on their way",
    "back bluewards in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) their envelopes become unstable as soon as the effective temperature reaches a value of 7000  k , and the star experiences an outburst .",
    "the yellow hypergiant @xmath0cas is famous for its outbursts , during which the star develops tio bands in a cool , optically thick wind with a very brief but high mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "each outburst is accompanied by a steep drop in the light curve .",
    "at least three such outbursts were recorded for @xmath0cas : 19451947 , 19851986 , and 20002001 .    in 2010",
    "we started to monitor spectroscopically several yellow hypergiants using the ondejov 2 m telescope .",
    "the aim of this campaign is to track and study their mass ejection phases .",
    "one of the objects we monitor is @xmath0cas .",
    "our spectroscopic data show that during 2013 another outburst occurred .",
    "the decrease of the time interval between the outbursts might indicate that @xmath0cas is preparing for its passage through the yellow void region @xcite towards the hot side of the hrd .",
    "the observations were obtained during 20102015 using the coud spectrograph attached to the perek 2-m telescope at ondejov observatory @xcite .",
    "spectra were taken in the wavelength regions 62506760 ( @xmath1 13000 ) and 69907500 ( @xmath1 15000 ) .",
    "the spectra taken on october 1 , 2013 reveal weak tio absorption bands at 7055 and 7126  together with many atmospheric lines characteristic for a later spectral type .",
    "photometric light curve obtained from the aavso international database and baavss database ( contributed by w.  vollmann and d.  loughney , respectively ) shows a drop in brightness by about 0.6 mag from may to october 2013 .",
    "changes in the line profiles are remarkable already in the spectra taken in june 2013 ( data point 5 in fig.[fig1 ] ) , when the visual brightness was still high . note the broad blue wings of the fei and feii lines indicating the onset of a strong stellar wind .",
    "we estimated the temperature of @xmath0cas ( right panel in fig.[fig1 ] ) using the fei @xmath26431 / feii @xmath26433 line ratio ( left panel in fig.[fig1 ] ) , calibrated by high resolution spectra ( elodie and uves pop ) of 19 late a to early k supergiants with precise effective temperature values @xmath3 from the literature @xcite .",
    "the estimated error is @xmath4100k .",
    "variations of @xmath3 follow the general trend of the light curve : hotter during bright phases and cooler during the outburst .",
    "our temperature estimates agree with the results by @xcite during the time overlap of our observations in 20102011 ( sao spectra : empty triangles in fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the radial velocity variability displayed by lines of different elements in various ionization stages indicates the vertical velocity structure within the outer atmosphere . the amplitude in fei is larger than in feii : the outer layers where fei lines form are much more affected by the outburst activity .",
    "we observe the same shift of the fei radial velocity curve with respect to the light curve as reported by @xcite , while the feii radial velocity curve follows both the light and effective temperature curves ."
