    "one of the main systematic errors in the neutrino experiments are those associated with neutrino cross sections .",
    "the high - intensity neutrino beams used in neutrino oscillation experiments are peaked in the 0.3 - 5 gev energy domain and allow the study of neutrino - nucleus interaction with unprecedented detail . in this energy range",
    "the dominant contribution to neutrino - nucleus scattering comes from the charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) reactions and resonance production processes .",
    "various modern  @xcite neutrino experiments reported measurements of the differential @xmath5 ( @xmath3 is squared four - momentum transfer )  @xcite , double - differential  @xcite and total cross sections  @xcite of ccqe scattering .",
    "this interaction represents a two - particle scattering process with lepton and nucleon in the final state .",
    "since the criteria used to select ccqe events are strongly influenced by both target material and detector technology , various selection techniques are applied in these experiments ( tracking and cerenkov detector ) . in neutrino scattering experiments , the neutrino energy is unknown .",
    "however , both the neutrino energy and @xmath3 can be evaluated based on the kinematics of the outgoing final state particles .    with the assumptions of conserved vector current and",
    "partially conserved axial current , the only undetermined form factor in the theoretical description of the ccqe neutrino scattering is the axial nucleon form factor . in most analysis of neutrino interaction on complex nuclei ,",
    "the dipole parametrization of @xmath0 with one parameter , the axial mass @xmath6 , is used .",
    "the analyses are mainly based on the relativistic fermi gas model ( rfgm )  @xcite and involve some additional model dependence due to nuclear structure .",
    "while constraints exist from pion electroproduction data with @xmath7 gev   @xcite , neutrino experiments usually treat axial mass @xmath6 in ccqe as independent of that measurement .",
    "the values of @xmath6 are obtained from a fit to observed @xmath3 distribution of events , differential and total ( anti)neutrino ccqe interaction cross sections .",
    "the formal averaging of @xmath6 values which are very widely spread was done in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath8 gev .",
    "this result is also known as world - averaged value of the axial mass .",
    "values of @xmath6 determined from the recent qe ( anti)neutrino - carbon scattering experiments range anywhere from @xmath9 1 to 1.35 gev . the nomad collaboration  @xcite reports @xmath10 gev , and the most resent minerva  @xcite results are consistent with @xmath11 gev . on the other hand , the miniboone collaboration  @xcite reports a large value of @xmath12 gev .",
    "the other recent results  @xcite similarly find central values higher than the above - mentioned world average .",
    "the absolute values of the differential and total cross sections measured by miniboone are about 30% larger as compared to the nomad results .",
    "it is essential to obtain consistency between experiments utilizing different beam energies , nuclear targets , and detectors .",
    "the radius of the nucleon axial charge distribution in terms of the dipole mass is defined as @xmath13 , and for @xmath14 gev it can be estimated as @xmath15 fm .",
    "so , a large value of @xmath16 gev corresponds to a rather small axial charge radius of about 0.51 fm . on the other hand ,",
    "the typical nucleon size as deduced from the electron scattering experiment is about 0.85 fm , whereas model - dependent analyses of proton - antiproton annihilation lead to a baryon charge radius of about 0.5 fm  @xcite .",
    "these results have encounraged many theoretical studies  @xcite to attempt to explain the discrepancy between the data and traditional nuclear model , i.e. , the rfgm .",
    "some models that are based on the impulse approximation lead to large value of @xmath6  @xcite in the miniboone data . for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite , a value of @xmath17 gev , that fits the @xmath3 shape of the measured @xmath5 cross section was obtained within the rfgm , and relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) approaches .",
    "other nuclear models  @xcite include effects of multinucleon excitations such as meson - exchange currents ( mecs ) and isobar currents ( ics ) to describe the miniboone data .",
    "the contribution of the two - particle - two - hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations to ccqe scattering has been found to be sizable and allows one to reproduce the miniboone cross sections with value of @xmath18 gev .",
    "this result suggests that much of the cross section ( about 30% ) measured by the miniboone experiment can be attributed to processes that are not properly qe scattering .",
    "however , fully relativistic microscopic calculations of 2p-2h contributions are extremely difficult and may be bound to model - dependent assumptions .",
    "future theoretical work is obviously needed to improve the present models that include effects beyond the impulse approximation .",
    "the transverse enhancement ( te ) effective model to account for mec effects has been proposed in ref .  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the magnetic form factors for nucleons bound in carbon are modified to describe the enhancement in the transverse electron - carbon qe cross section .",
    "the other nucleon form factors are the same as for free nucleons .",
    "it allows one to describe the miniboone data ( total cross section ) by using the dipole approximation for @xmath0 with @xmath19 gev .",
    "the assumption of the dipole ansatz for the axial form factor is a crucial element in these studies .",
    "the dipole parametrization of @xmath0 has no strict theoretical basis and the choice of this parametrization is made by analogy with electromagnetic form factors .",
    "on the other hand the dipole ansatz has been found to conflict with electron scattering data for the vector form factor  @xcite .",
    "a model - independent description of the axial form factor was presented in ref .",
    "the application of analyticity and dispersion relations to the axial form factor in the rfgm to find constraints for the axial mass using the data from miniboone produces the value of @xmath20 gev which differs significantly from extractions based on the traditional dipole ansatz .",
    "the pion and nucleon form factors were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite within the large-@xmath21 approach in the spacelike region .",
    "it was shown that , if the error bars on the monopole mass are taken into account one can make the dipole overlap with a product of monopoles within the corresponding error bars provided with the half - width rule . this construction is based on the following assumptions : ( a ) hadronic form factors in the spacelike region are dominated by mesonic states with the relevant quantum number , ( b ) the high - energy behavior is given by perturbative qcd , and the number of mesons is taken to be minimal to satisfy these conditions , and ( c ) errors in the meson - dominated form factors are estimated by means of the half - width rule .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the values of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 were extracted from the differential cross section of neutrino scattering on deuterium ( on a `` quasifree '' nucleon ) .",
    "a reasonable description of axial form factor by dipole approximation with @xmath22 gev was found .",
    "the current data on ccqe scattering come from a variety of experiments operating with carbon , oxygen , and iron data .",
    "therefore the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we propose a method which allow one to determine @xmath0 as a function of @xmath3 directly from the measured flux - integrated @xmath23 cross section of ccqe ( anti)neutrino scattering on nuclei .",
    "second , we apply the method and extract the @xmath3-dependence of the axial form factor from miniboone data  @xcite in the rfgm , rdwia and rfgm+te approaches and show that the @xmath3-dependence for the axial and vector form factors are correlated .",
    "we also compare the extracted @xmath3-dependence of @xmath0 with predictions of the meson - dominance ansatz and dipole approximation predictions with @xmath9 1  gev and @xmath9 1.3  gev    the outline of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "ii we present briefly the rdwia model and discuss the procedure which allows determination of the axial form factor from the flux - integrated @xmath5 ( anti)neutrino cross section .",
    "section iii presents results of the extraction of @xmath4 from the miniboone data and calculations of the flux - unfolded total cross sections for antineutrino scattering off carbon .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "the formalism of ccqe exclusive    @xmath24    and inclusive @xmath25 scattering off nuclei in the one - w - boson exchange approximation has been extensively described in previous works  @xcite .",
    "here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the initial and final lepton momenta respectively , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the initial and final target momenta , respectively @xmath30 is the ejectile nucleon momentum , @xmath31 is the momentum transfer , and @xmath32 .",
    "all the nuclear structure information and final state interaction ( fsi ) effects are contained in the weak cc nuclear tensors @xmath33 , which are given by a bilinear product of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear cc operator @xmath34 between the initial nucleus state and the final state .",
    "we describe ccqe neutrino - nuclear scattering in the impulse approximation ( ia ) , assuming that the incoming neutrino interacts with only one nucleon , which is subsequently emitted , while the remaining ( a-1 ) nucleons in the target are spectators .",
    "the nuclear current is written as the sum of single - nucleon currents .    the single - nucleon charged current has @xmath35 structure @xmath36 . for a free - nucleon vertex function",
    "@xmath37 we use the vector current vertex function @xmath38 , where @xmath39/2 $ ] and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the weak vector form factors . they are related to the corresponding electromagnetic ones for protons and neutrons by the hypothesis of the conserved vector current .",
    "we use the approximation of ref .",
    "@xcite on the nucleon form factors . because the bound nucleons are off shell we employ the de forest prescription  @xcite and the coulomb gauge for off - shell vector current vertex @xmath42 .",
    "the axial current vertex function can be written in terms of the axial @xmath0 and the pseudoscalar @xmath43 form factors : @xmath44 the pseudoscalar form factor @xmath43 is dominated by the pion pole and is given in term of the godberger - treiman relation near @xmath45 if partially conserved axial current is assumed .",
    "we assume that the similar relation is valid for high @xmath3 as well and write @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the pion mass .",
    "then the axial current vertex function can be written in the form @xmath49 .",
    "% \\label{w}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus the only undetermined form factor is the axial form factor that is commonly parametrized as a dipole @xmath50 where @xmath51=1.267 and @xmath6 is the axial mass , which controls the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath4 , and ultimately , the normalization of the predicted cross section .",
    "we calculated the relativistic wave functions of the bound nucleon states in the independent particle shell model as the self - consistent solutions of a dirac equation , derived within a relativistic mean field approach , from a lagrangian containing @xmath52 , and @xmath53 mesons ( the @xmath54 model)@xcite . according to the jlab data  @xcite the occupancy of the independent particle shell - model orbitals of @xmath55c equals on average 89% . in this work",
    "we assume that the missing strength ( 11% ) can be attributed to the short - range nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath56 ) correlations in the ground state , leading to the appearance of the high - momentum and high - energy component in the nucleon distribution in the target .",
    "these estimates of the depletion of hole states follow from the rdwia analysis of @xmath55c@xmath57 for @xmath58 ( gev / c)@xmath59  @xcite and are consistent with a direct measurement of the spectral function  @xcite , which observed approximately 0.6 protons in a region attributable to a single - nucleon knockout from a correlated cluster . in the rdwia ,",
    "final state interaction effects for the outgoing nucleon are taken into account .",
    "the distorted - wave function of the knocked out nucleon is evaluated as a solution of a dirac equation containing a phenomenological relativistic optical potential .",
    "we use the lea program  @xcite for the numerical calculation of the distorted wave functions with the edad1 parametrization  @xcite of the relativistic optical potential for carbon .",
    "this code , initially designed for computing exclusive proton - nucleus and electron - nucleus scattering , was successfully tested against a@xmath60 data  @xcite , and we adopted this program for neutrino reactions .",
    "a complex optical potential with a nonzero imaginary part generally produces an absorption of the flux . for the exclusive a@xmath61 channel",
    "this reflects the coupling between different open reaction channels .",
    "however , for the inclusive reaction , the total flux must be conserved .",
    "therefore , we calculate the inclusive and total cross sections with the edad1 relativistic optical potential in which only the real part is included .",
    "the inclusive cross sections with the fsi effects in the presence of the short - range @xmath56 correlations were calculated by using the method proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "the contribution of the @xmath56 correlated pairs is evaluated in the ia , i.e. , the virtual boson couples to only one member of the @xmath56-pair .",
    "it is one - body process that leads to the emission of two nucleons ( 2p-2h excitation ) .",
    "the contributions of the two - body currents , such as meson - exchange currents and isobar currents , are not considered .",
    "the inclusive weak hadronic tensor @xmath62 is given by bilinear products of the transition matrix elements of the nuclear weak current operators @xmath34 between the initial and final nuclear states , i.e. , @xmath63 , where the angle brackets denote products of matrix elements , appropriately averaged over initial states and summed over final states .    by using eq .",

    "the expression for the hadronic tensor is then given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is 1 for a neutrino and -1 for an antineutrino .",
    "finally , contracting @xmath62 with the lepton tensor we obtain the inclusive ( anti)neutrino scattering cross section @xmath1 in terms of vector @xmath72 , axial @xmath73 , and vector - axial @xmath74 cross sections @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the vector ( axial )",
    "cross section is due to the vector ( axial ) component of the weak current and it can be calculated as the @xmath1 cross section with @xmath78 @xmath79 .",

    "we can argue that there is no need to use the dipole approximation for fitting the miniboone data and that the meson dominance already contains the essential physical information , whereas we found that there is a disagreement between the form factors extracted in the rfgm+te approach and predicted by the dipole approximation with @xmath168 gev .",
    "the rdwia , pwia and rfgm calculated with @xmath138 gev and measured neutrino and antineutrino ccqe total cross sections match well within the experimental error over the entire measured range .",
    "we conclude that the miniboone measured inclusive and total cross sections can be described within the impulse approximation with the meson - dominance ansatz and/or dipole approximation of @xmath0 with large axial mass value .",
    "in addition , one could also describe miniboone data with the approach that incorporates the large mec contributions .",
