    "several unification schemes merging gravity and the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions predict the existence of short - range forces with coupling strength of the order of newtonian gravity @xcite .",
    "efforts to evidence a _",
    "fifth force _ have been envisaged regardless of any concrete unification scheme since various decades @xcite , and there are compelling reasons to improve our limits especially in the largely unexplored submillimeter range .",
    "constraints in both coupling and range for these interactions have been obtained with various experimental setups , including the recent configurations using a disk - shaped torsional balance parallel to a rotating flat surface @xcite , or micromechanical resonators in a parallel plane geometry @xcite . due to the surge of activity in the study of casimir forces",
    ", limits have been also given in the submicrometer range based on the level of accuracy between casimir theory and experiment .",
    "however , unlike the case of experiments performed between bodies kept at larger distances , the use of the parallel plane geometry on such small lengthscale has been proven to be challenging in terms of parallelism @xcite , and therefore the attention has been focused on the analysis of the residuals in the casimir theory - experiment comparison involving the sphere - plane configuration .",
    "dedicated efforts to obtain limits from sphere - plane casimir experiments have involved the use of the so - called proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite , which allows to map the force @xmath1 between a sphere of radius @xmath2 and a plane located at a distance @xmath3 from the sphere into the energy per unit area @xmath4 of the parallel plate configuration , namely @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this approximation is believed to be valid in the limit @xmath6 and to hold with a high degree of accuracy for forces between entities concentrated on the surfaces , such as electrostatic or casimir forces between conductors @xcite .",
    "obviously , in order to test how well pfa approximates the exact force , one needs either to compute the interaction exactly or at least to assess reliable bounds . for the electrostatic sphere - plane interaction , the exact analytical result for",
    "the force is well - known and has a closed form @xcite , such that deviations from pfa can be readily analyzed . for the casimir sphere - plane interaction ,",
    "the exact force has been computed only very recently , both for ideal @xcite and real metallic plates @xcite .",
    "available analytical and numerical results seem to indicate that , at least for zero temperature and within the used plasma model , deviations from pfa applied to the sphere - plane casimir interaction are small , of the order of @xmath7 or higher , in recent casimir experiments aiming to put limits to yukawa interactions .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that the application of the pfa to forces acting between entities embedded in volumetric manifolds , such as gravitational forces or their putative short - range components , is in general _ invalid _ and has to be carefully scrutinized in each specific configuration .",
    "based on this suggestion , a recent reanalysis of the pfa in the case of gravitational and yukawian forces has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of this reanalysis is that `` a confusion with different formulations of the pfa '' existed in the previous literature , and that `` care is required in the application of the pfa to gravitational forces '' .",
    "this confusion is stated to originate from a specific form of the pfa used so far , to be contrasted with a more general formulation of the pfa . in @xcite",
    "it is also claimed that the difference between the two pfas is negligible in the actual configuration used to give the allegedly best limits obtained in the 100 nm range @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further discuss the meaning of the pfa in the case of volumetric forces .",
    "we argue that the discrepancy between the two forms of the pfa is a significant source of error in the determination of bounds on parameters of yukawian forces from force residuals in casimir sphere - plane experiments performed so far that used pfa to model such non - newtonian forces .",
    "we then show that the general form for the pfa discussed in @xcite is simply a different choice of the infinitesimal volume for integrating the force due to an extended object , and coincides with the exact result only in the case when one of the two surfaces is an infinite planar slab ( or semispace ) .",
    "the level of approximation in using the two pfas for yukawa forces in the sphere - plane geometry is of the same order of magnitude as the casimir theory - experiment comparison , that uses pfa to compute the sphere - plane casimir force ( as already noticed in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , since such a comparison provides force _ residuals _ that are in turn compared against the theory of yukawa forces to obtain limits on its @xmath0 parameter space , the use of these _ subsequent _ pfa approximations of comparable level of approximation provides a possible source of systematic error , not carefully accounted for so far .",
    "we also argue that other volumetric effects not directly related to the pfa , such as the finite size of the planar surface used in the actual experiments , may provide a source of systematic error not taken into account so far , which strongly affects the limits to power - law forces @xcite , but should not be a major source of concern on limits to yukawa forces .",
    "we believe that , considering the various number of complications related to the sphere - plane geometry , upgraded versions of parallel plates experiments such as the ones discussed in @xcite could provide limits on yukawian and power - law forces in the submicrometer range more immune to a set of systematic errors characteristic of the sphere - plane configuration .",
    "in order to introduce the notation and as a prelude to our discussion , we briefly summarize the results contained in @xcite .",
    "the actual experimental configuration used in @xcite is not a parallel plate geometry , rather it is a sphere - plane geometry , and the pfa is used to map the force between a sphere and a plane @xmath8 into the energy per unit area of the parallel plate configuration @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the geometrical average of the principal radii of curvature of the spherical surface evaluated at its point of minimum distance from the plane . in the experiment reported in @xcite ,",
    "the force is measured by looking at the frequency shift of a mechanical resonator , as customary in atomic force microscopy @xcite , and as first reported in the context of casimir force measurements in @xcite .",
    "the frequency shift is proportional to the gradient of the force , and therefore @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the plane - plane pressure , and @xmath14 is the mass of the resonator .",
    "the measure of the frequency shift can then be mapped , via use of eq .",
    "( [ approxpfa ] ) , into the equivalent pressure exerted between two fictitious parallel plates mimicking the actual sphere - plane geometry . within the validity of eq .",
    "( [ approxpfa ] ) , this is a valid assumption for the case of forces acting between surfaces , such as electrostatic forces between conductors or casimir forces .",
    "a first sign of the fact that there can be issues with the pfa in dealing with volumetric forces , such as the hypothetical yukawian forces of gravitational origin , is manifested by noticing that the exact formula for the yukawa force between two infinite parallel slabs depends on the thicknesses of both slabs , which implies that the pfa formula applied to the volumetric yukawa force in the sphere - slab configuration also depends on _ both _ thicknesses ( and on the sphere radius ) .",
    "however , the exact sphere - slab force obviously depends only on the slab thickness and on the sphere radius - it does not , and can not , depend on the thickness of the _ metaphysical _ slab introduced in the virtual mapping to the parallel geometry .",
    "indeed , consider the yukawa potential energy for two pointlike masses @xmath15 and @xmath16 , located at positions @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , @xmath19 where , as usual , the strength of the yukawa interaction is parameterized in terms of newton s gravitational constant @xmath20 through a dimensionless quantity @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is its range .",
    "assuming that the yukawa interaction is additive , once integrated over two infinite , homogeneous parallel slabs separated by a distance @xmath3 , one derives the corresponding pressure @xmath23 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 indicate the thickness of each slab , @xmath27 and @xmath28 their densities . the exact yukawa interaction in the sphere - slab geometry can be readily computed , assuming additivity .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath29 as we mentioned above , most recent experimental works on limits to extra - gravitational forces from sphere - plane casimir measurements used the usual pfa . in this approximation ,",
    "the yukawa force between a homogeneous sphere and an infinite homogeneous slab of thickness @xmath25 is @xmath30 in this case one needed to consider , in order to map the actual sphere - plane configuration into a parallel plate geometry , a fictitious upper plate of thickness @xmath26 large enough , _",
    "i.e. _ much larger than the explored yukawa range ( @xmath31 ) . again , this situation may appear disturbing to whoever believes that any experiment - theory comparison should not rely on the introduction of arbitrary parameters not having a tangible , measurable counterpart in the concrete experimental setup .",

    "the force between two compact bodies is expressed as the sum of forces between plane parallel surface elements @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 component of the force is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the pressure between two parallel plates at a local distance @xmath37 ( @xmath38 are the surfaces of the two bodies ) , @xmath3 is the distance between them ( smallest value of @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 is the part of the @xmath41-plane where both surfaces are defined ( see fig .",
    "the epfa prediction for the yukawa force between a sphere and an infinite planar slab is @xcite @xmath42 which coincides with the exact result of eq.([yukexact ] ) . in fig.2",
    "we plot the ratio @xmath43 @xmath44 as a function of the yukawa parameter @xmath22 , for different values of the sphere radius keeping fixed @xmath45 ( left plot ) , and for different values of @xmath26 keeping fixed the sphere radius at @xmath46 m ( right plot ) .",
    "note that @xmath43 is independent of the sphere - slab separation @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath47 , as surely realized in the left plot , pfa always _ overestimates _ the epfa result , i.e. @xmath48 ( similarly to how the pfa overestimates the exact casimir force in the sphere - plane geometry ) . note also that when @xmath31 the atoms in the  bulk \" of the two bodies do not contribute appreciably to the yukawa force , thereby making it effectively of a surface character ( i.e. , non - volumetric ) , as in the case of casimir or electrostatic forces .",
    "instead , for values of @xmath49 ( or smaller ) the volumetric character of the yukawa interaction is manifest , and @xmath43 is no longer less than one ( right plot ) . in this case",
    "the pfa applied to yukawa forces is invalid and in the data analysis one should at least declare the value of @xmath26 imagined for which the limits are assessed . overestimating the yukawa force leads to stronger limits for the coupling constant @xmath21 for a given @xmath22 with respect to the proper use of the epfa . considering the relatively small margins of improvement reported recently ( see for instance fig . 3 in @xcite ) a systematic shift due to the use of the pfa instead of the epfa may lead to significant changes for the exclusion region in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "both plots show that the use of pfa instead of epfa is unreliable especially in the region near or above @xmath22=100 nm . unfortunately the region in between 100 nm and few @xmath50 m is also the one _ directly _ explored with the casimir force experiments , since actual measurements take place in this range of distance between the involved objects .",
    "it is known that the best limits on yukawa interactions can be set for @xmath22 of the order of the actual explored distance between the two bodies @xmath51 , and the extrapolation of the measurements to smaller @xmath22 is affected by the fast growth of the bounds as @xmath52 .",
    "the fact that the epfa eq .",
    "( [ yukepfa ] ) gives the correct exact results for the yukawa ( and also gravitational ) force in the sphere - plane configuration is in fact a trivial consequence of the additivity of these interactions and of the translational invariance of the infinite plane surface , the shape of second surface ( in this case a sphere ) being irrelevant .",
    "indeed , the epfa is just a _ different _ parameterization of the exact formula of addition of forces between particles . on one hand ,",
    "the exact interaction energy between a test mass and an infinite slab ( or half - space ) depends only on the normal coordinate @xmath34 , being independent of the in - plane coordinates @xmath53 by symmetry .",
    "hence , the potential due to the infinite slab is @xmath54 . for a body ( _ e.g.",
    "_ a sphere ) of mass density @xmath55 , additivity implies that the total interaction energy can be obtained as @xmath56 and similarly for the force . since @xmath57 depends only on @xmath34 , it is convenient to compute the integral by adding forces at different slices at constant @xmath34 , _",
    "i.e. _ considering infinitesimal slices in @xmath34 , then evaluating first the potential energy of a slice of the body parallel to the plane at a distance @xmath34 @xmath58 and then integrating along @xmath34 the quantity @xmath59 one obtains the exact expression for the body - plane interaction @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "on the other hand , the epfa states that the interaction energy between the body and the plane is obtained from slicing the body into cylinders perpendicular to the plane ( see fig . 1 right ) and integrating the cylinder - plane interaction energy along the portion of the body that faces the plane ( i.e.",
    ", one must integrate over the surface @xmath40 on the plane that is the normal shadow of the body ) .",
    "the potential energy of this column of the body centered around @xmath41 is @xmath61 and then integrating along @xmath62 the quantity @xmath63 one gets the epfa expression for the body - plane interaction @xmath60 ( see fig . 1 right ) .",
    "again , since the interaction is additive and it does not depend on the @xmath62 coordinates , this integral is exactly equal to the previous one : we are simply integrating the same function @xmath64 over the body using a different parameterization of the volumetric integral .",
    "the same holds for the force between any body ( not necessarily a sphere ) and an infinite slab ( see also @xcite ) .     versus @xmath22 in the case of spheres of radius @xmath65150 , 100 , and 50@xmath50 m , in the limit of @xmath66 .",

    "the exact interaction energy @xmath71 between a source body and a test mass at position @xmath72 can be easily computed .",
    "for instance , for the spherical source body @xmath73 depends only on @xmath74 , with the origin of coordinates at the center of the sphere . integrating @xmath71 over the volume of the second body one gets the exact result .",
    "for example , for the two - spheres case the gravitational energy depends only on the center - to - center distance and scales as @xmath75 .",
    "let us compare this known exact result with the epfa prediction .",

    "the presence of suppression factors for the farthest point of the form @xmath169 makes very insensitive the yukawa force to the finite size of the disk ( for previous considerations , see also @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis , although confirming some of the results already discussed in @xcite , draws quite different conclusions from the common outcome .",
    "in particular , we argue that the application of pfa to volumetric forces is not rigorous if considered in its original formulation applied so far to compute the sphere - plane yukawa interactions in the most sphere - plane casimir force experiments reported in @xcite .",
    "it application to volumetric forces is instead of trivial nature if considered in the exact formulation efpa discussed in @xcite , since the latter is identical to the exact calculation , just differing in the choice of the infinitesimal integration volume .",
    "we have shown that the usual pfa is an invalid approximation to compute volumetric forces .",
    "in particular , it does not reproduce in its usual range of validity exact known expressions for gravitational and yukawa interactions in non - translational invariant geometries , such as sphere - finite size slab or sphere - sphere configurations .",
    "exact \" pfa is the exact expression for any additive two - body interaction when one of the bodies is translational invariant , as is the case for a sphere in front of an infinite homogeneous slab or half - space . for non - translational invariant geometries , epfa also fails to give the exact result for volumetric interactions , even in the regime of parameters where it is assumed to be valid , therefore also being an invalid approximation for volumetric forces .",
    "the difference between the two formulations of the pfa is shown to affect significantly the limits obtained so far unless one considers a regime of yukawa range so small , @xmath32 , that the approximation of a surface force ( _ i.e. _ neglecting the yukawa force due to the atoms in the `` bulk '' of the two bodies , therefore manifestly of non - volumetric character ) holds . by using the pfa the yukawa force is overestimated and therefore the limits in the @xmath0 plane become more stringent than by using the exact force estimated via epfa .",
    "moreover , the use of pfa instead of the epfa for the parameters of the experiment supposed to provide the strongest limits to yukawian interactions @xcite occurs with an accuracy of the same order of magnitude with which the exact casimir force is expected to be also approximated by the corresponding pfa . on one hand",
    ", since the casimir theory - experiment comparison provides force _ residuals _ that are in turn compared against the theory of yukawa forces to obtain limits on them , the use of these _ subsequent _ pfa approximations of comparable level of approximation provides a possible source of systematic error , not carefully accounted for so far . on the other hand , both casimir and yukawa pfas overestimate the respective exact forces , and therefore the systematic source of error introduced by their use might be less critical than expected on first principles . in any case , it is important to assess as much as possible both sources of errors or , in alternative , to use exact expressions for the yukawa and casimir forces . furthermore , a systematic source of error present even in the epfa scheme for finite - size planar surfaces has been discussed and shown to be significant only for power - law forces .",
    "our analysis suggests that future limits ( or reanalysis of experiments already performed ) on yukawian forces should rely upon the use of the exact expression for the yukawa force , as performed in @xcite .",
    "it is also worth to point out that all the above considerations hold provided that the simple scenario of additive forces is assumed , which is valid in general for weak forces among atoms in the low density limit , such that correlations leading to fluctuating forces are negligible .",
    "however , the hypothetical yukawa forces should be located in a regime of coupling constants intermediate between the gravitational ( additive ) force and the casimir ( non additive ) force .",
    "it is not understood a priori if the yukawa force is weak enough to make the additivity assumption reliable , and this should be kept in mind in future broad - range searches of these forces .    finally ,",
    "considering the complications emerging in the sphere - plane geometry due to the presence of previously unidentified systematics such as the sensitivity to deviations from the ideal spherical geometry @xcite and possible effects of variability of the contact potential with distance @xcite , it may be worth to focus future casimir experiments to set bounds on extra - gravitational forces on the actual parallel - plane geometry , without the drawbacks of a virtual mapping from the sphere - plane geometry made explicit in this paper .",
    "the stronger force signal expected for the same distance between the two surfaces , the reduced sensitivity to distance - dependent contact potentials due to image charges , the absence of deviations from a uniform radius of curvature , the existence of exact mode summation techniques to compute the casimir force , the possibility to control parallelism using recently developed technology @xcite , and the possibility to compensate off - line the lack of parallelism by using the pfa as discussed in @xcite , all point in the direction to continue this class of experiments in the actual parallel plane configuration , extending below the 10 @xmath50 m range the results of the experiments described in @xcite .                                                                                        with regard to power - law forces",
    ", we would like also to remark that , in the casimir theory - experiment comparison at the basis of the limits to non - newtonian forces , it is also important to calculate the exact casimir force in the presence of a planar slab of _ finite _ size , especially for the configuration used in @xcite ."
