    "the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy markarian 59 ( mrk 59 ) @xmath8 i zw 49 belongs to the class of cometary bcds with an intense starburst at the end of an elongated low surface brightness stellar body .",
    "this bcd have numerous knots composed of a chain of h  ii regions , resulting from propagating star formation along the galaxy s elongated body and ending with the high - surface - brightness supergiant h  ii region . from deep ground - based spectrophotometric observations of the supergiant h  ii regions",
    "noeske et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived an oxygen abundance log o / h = -4.011 @xmath7 0.003 ( @xmath0/8 ) .",
    "o abundances were also derived for two other emission knots along the elongated body and were found to be the same within the errors . the small scatter in metallicity along the major axis of mrk 59 ( @xmath9 0.2 dex ) suggests that the mixing of elements in the ionized gas has been efficient on a spatial scale of several kpc .",
    "mrk 59 was observed during 7,865 s on 2000 , january 11 with _ fuse _ ( moos et al .",
    "the lwrs large entrance aperture ( 30``@xmath1030 '' ) was used , so that all of mrk 59 which is @xmath9 20 \" across ( noeske et al . 2000 )",
    "is included within it .",
    "mrk 59 shows numerous interstellar absorption lines from the h  i lyman series ( ly @xmath11 to ly @xmath12 ( h  i 11 ) ) and from other atoms and ions such as c  ii , c  iii , n  i , n  ii , n  iii , o  i , si  ii , s  iii , s  iv , fe  ii and fe  iii . several stellar features such as the si  iv and",
    "s vi lines are also detected ( thuan et al .",
    "we found that the shapes of the h  i lyman series lines can not be reproduced with voigt profiles characterized by a single h  i column density .",
    "damping wings are clearly visible , signaling a very large h  i column density @xmath13  @xmath4 .",
    "however , this high column density is not consistent with the shape of the strongest h  i lines ( lyman  @xmath11 to lyman  @xmath14 ) .",
    "for instance , although damping wings are also present , the core of the lyman  @xmath14 line is thin and can not be fitted with a model profile with the column density needed to fit the higher lines in the series .",
    "the thin core implies a smaller column density , of the order of @xmath15  @xmath4 .",
    "we interpret that by a non - interstellar but stellar origin of the wide damping wings . we conclude that the broad wings of the above lines arise in the photospheres of numerous b stars , while their narrower cores are caused by interstellar absorption . by fitting the cores of the lyman series lines , we obtain an interstellar h  i column density of @xmath1610@xmath17  @xmath4 .",
    "no line of h@xmath1 is seen at the radial velocity of mrk  59 . using nine h@xmath1 lyman bands ( 00 to 80 ) , we conclude that the total column density of diffuse h@xmath1 is @xmath1810@xmath19@xmath4 .",
    "this implies that the ratio of h@xmath1 to hi is @xmath1810@xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding average molecular fraction @xmath21=2@xmath2(h@xmath1)/(@xmath2(h  i)+2@xmath2(h@xmath1 ) ) is @xmath22 .    by calculating the amount of h@xmath1 molecules formed on the surface of dust grains , we find that the expected @xmath2(h@xmath1 ) must be @xmath92@xmath1010@xmath23  @xmath4 , consistent with our upper limit . as compared to the milky way",
    ", the low column density of diffuse h@xmath1 in mrk 59 is due to the combined effects of a large uv flux which destroys the h@xmath1 molecules and of a low metallicity resulting in a scarcity of dust grains on which h@xmath1 form ( see the full discussion in thuan et al .",
    "to estimate the abundances , we consider two cases .",
    "the first case presented during the meeting assumes that there is a single velocity component along the thousands of lines of sight to the stars of mkr  59 . in this case ,",
    "absorption lines that are broader than the instrumental point spread function and do not go down to zero are supposed to be not saturated .",
    "the second case , suggested during the meeting ( york , public communication ) , assume multiple velocity components along the multiple lines of sight , some of which may have saturated profiles .",
    "a)fitting with a single voigt profile .",
    "@xmath24 is in kms@xmath6 .",
    "error bars are 3 @xmath25 limits .",
    "+ b)fitting with multiple velocity components , each with @xmath26 = 7 km s@xmath6 , and spanning a velocity range of 100 kms@xmath6 .",
    "error bars are 2 @xmath25 limits .",
    "+      we consider first the single interstellar velocity component case . some of the lines , like the feiii and siii lines , are very broad with unreasonably large doppler widths ( @xmath5@xmath27100  km  s@xmath6 ) , suggesting , as for the hi lines , that these metal lines have some contamination by stellar absorption .",
    "the resulting column densities ( @xmath28 ) and doppler widths ( @xmath24 ) along with their error bars are given in table  1 .",
    "the error bars of the column densities include the uncertainty in @xmath5 .",
    "these abundances of the metals relative to @xmath2(hi ) are extremely low .",
    "in particular , with log @xmath2(oi)/@xmath2(hi ) =  5.7 , the oxygen abundance in the hi gas could be @xmath9 50 times lower than the oxygen abundance in the ionized gas , as determined from the optical emission line spectrum of the supergiant hii region in mrk 59",
    ". however , these very low abundances may be underestimates due to the saturation of some lines of sight .",
    "we are observing through the _ fuse _ aperture along thousands of lines of sight towards uv - bright stars . the observed spectrum is the sum of many spectra .",
    "it can happen that some lines of sight have saturated absorption lines with a small @xmath5 parameter , but because they have different radial velocities spread over several tens of kms@xmath6 , the broad absorption line resulting from the sum of many narrow absorption lines does not go to zero intensity , and its width is larger than the point spread function . in that case ,",
    "a single velocity component fit to the line profile would result in an overestimate of the @xmath5 parameter and in an underestimate of the column density .    to investigate this issue ,",
    "we have calculated profiles resulting from the addition of multiple lines of sight .",
    "we adopt the simple model where the different lines of sight have radial velocities distributed uniformly between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the spread in velocity due mostly to the velocity dispersion of the system of absorbing clouds along the multiple lines of sight , and also partly to the wavelength smearing caused by the extension of mrk 59 within the aperture .",
    "we determine the best estimates of @xmath5 ( assumed to be the same for all lines of sight ) and @xmath31 by the simultaneous fit of several lines of o  i , n  i and fe  ii .",
    "each of these elements having several transitions with different oscillator strengths , this well constrains @xmath5 and @xmath32 to reasonable values : @xmath5=7@xmath33kms@xmath6 and @xmath31=100@xmath720kms@xmath6 ( 2@xmath25 limits , see fig  1 ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath31 is very close to the fwhm of 92kms@xmath6 of the h  i profile ( thuan et al .",
    "the heavy element column densities derived with the multi - component fit are given in table1 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "those are larger than in the case of a single component fit , by a mean factor of @xmath95 .",
    "the very large column densities derived for ciii , siii and feiii are caused by stellar contamination .",
    "it is interesting to note that , even with a higher derived oxygen abundance , log @xmath2(o  i)/@xmath2(h  i ) = ",
    "5.0@xmath70.3 , the h  i absorbing cloud still has a metallicity lower than that of the supergiant h  ii region by a factor of @xmath9 10 .",
    "this suggests self - contamination of the h  ii region by heavy elements released during the present burst of star formation ( kunth & sargent 1986 ) .",
    "while mixing of these newly formed heavy elements appears to have occurred on the scale ( @xmath35  kpc ) of the h  ii regions ( noeske et al .",
    "2000 ) , it has not had time to occur for the whole neutral gas component as the h  i envelope surrounding the star - forming regions is much more extended ( its diameter is @xmath9 19 kpc from the vla map by thuan et al .",
