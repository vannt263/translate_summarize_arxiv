    "quantum entanglement plays an essential role in quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "various kinds of investigation have been carried out to understand properties of entanglement for the last two decades  @xcite .",
    "the thermal entanglement  @xcite , which is entanglement of thermal equilibrium states , is one of the important concepts because it shows us the effect of thermal fluctuations on entanglement .",
    "thermal disturbances generally cause disentanglement and have serious effects on quantum information processing .",
    "therefore , many schemes have been proposed to protect entanglement from thermal disturbances  @xcite .",
    "as one of these schemes , a lot of attention has been paid to methods based on manipulation of local hamiltonians  @xcite ; for example , in quantum spin systems , bipartite thermal entanglement can be enhanced by modulating external magnetic fields . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on a simple question as to how much entanglement can be generated by optimizing the local hamiltonian .",
    "we give a theoretical limit of entanglement enhancement by manipulation of the local hamiltonians .",
    "relationships between the thermal entanglement and local parameters have been investigated especially in bipartite quantum spin systems  @xcite . from these researches ,",
    "behavior of the thermal entanglement under external magnetic fields may be understood in the cases of almost all interactions .",
    "however , little has been reported on the _ maximization _ problem of the thermal entanglement ; in the case of the bipartite @xmath1  spin model , this problem has been solved only numerically  @xcite . until now , there are no analytical approaches to optimizing the thermal entanglement of arbitrarily interacting two qubits .    in the present paper , we will answer the following question : given a system of two qubits which interact via an arbitrary interaction hamiltonian , how can we maximize the thermal entanglement between these two qubits by changing only the local hamiltonian ?",
    "a naive approach to this problem may be to solve the optimization problem numerically . however , this problem has six local parameters in total and the functional forms of entanglement measures such as the concurrence  @xcite and the negativity  @xcite are very complicated .",
    "thus , for an arbitrary interaction , it is difficult to solve this optimization problem numerically .",
    "therefore , we employ perturbation techniques and utilize symmetric properties in order to determine the optimizing local hamiltonian analytically . in this way ,",
    "for all kinds of interaction , we give general properties of the optimized entanglement .",
    "our main results are the following :    1 .",
    "we find that at low temperatures the thermal entanglement is maximum without any local hamiltonians , whereas at high temperatures it is maximized by non - zero local fields .",
    "we refer to the former temperature range as the low - temperature phase and the latter temperature range as the high - temperature phase .",
    "the secondary differentiation of the maximized entanglement is discontinuous at the phase boundary .",
    "2 .   in the high - temperature phase ,",
    "the functional form of the optimizing local hamiltonian is independent of the temperature ; only the coefficients depend on the temperature .",
    "the optimized entanglement , enhanced by a local hamiltonian in the high - temperature phase , decreases with increasing temperature as @xmath2 .",
    "if the interaction hamiltonian has no degeneracy of its eigenvalues , the entanglement is maximized without local hamiltonians over a finite range of the low - temperature phase .",
    "if the interaction hamiltonian has degeneracy , the low - temperature phase shrinks to the zero - temperature point . the optimizing local hamiltonian becomes infinitesimal and the optimized entanglement becomes full in the low - temperature limit .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  ii , we state the main problem after symmetry consideration . in section",
    "iii , we give the main theorems on the entanglement optimization . in section",
    "iv , we show numerical results of the optimizing local parameters , the boundary temperatures and the singularity at the phase boundary .",
    "we also argue that the two phases appear because of competition between the purifying effect and the decoupling effect both of the local hamiltonian .",
    "finally , in section  v , a discussion concludes the paper .",
    "first , we set the fundamental framework of the present problem . we consider a @xmath3 system of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the most general form of the hamiltonian of this system is given as follows : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pauli matrices , @xmath9 is an interaction hamiltonian , and @xmath10 is a local hamiltonian .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 are fixed and independent of the temperature , whereas we can change the parameters @xmath12 arbitrarily .",
    "we parametrize the local fields in the polar coordinates as @xmath13 hereafter , we use the parametrization @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; in other words , @xmath17 then , the four eigenvalues of @xmath10 are @xmath18 where we define the corresponding eigenstates as @xmath19 .",
    "the density matrix in thermal equilibrium is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the partition function and @xmath22 with @xmath23 the boltzmann constant . in order to quantify entanglement",
    ", we adopt the negativity  @xcite as an entanglement measure .",
    "the negativity is defined as the trace norm of a partially transposed density matrix : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the trace norm , @xmath26 denotes the transpose with respect to only @xmath4 , and @xmath27 is the minimum , possibly negative eigenvalue of @xmath28 .",
    "the second equation of ( [ negativity ] ) comes from the fact that @xmath28 can have only one negative eigenvalue , if any  @xcite .",
    "thus , the present entanglement optimization problem is equivalent to finding the values of @xmath12 which maximize @xmath29 for an arbitrary fixed interaction @xmath9 .    before presenting our main results on the entanglement optimization , we prove the following lemma  1 to simplify the present entanglement optimization problem",
    ".    _ lemma  1_. by local unitary transformations of @xmath9 , we can eliminate the interaction parameters @xmath30 and reduce it to the form @xmath31 we can also choose the parameters @xmath32 such that @xmath33 or @xmath34 .    in spin-1/2 systems",
    ", this means that we can transform any interactions including the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm )  @xcite interaction into a ferromagnetic or an anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg exchange interaction .    _",
    "proof_. we can prove this lemma by applying a singular value decomposition  @xcite to the matrix @xmath35 . in this case , the singular value decomposition @xmath36 is performed by @xmath37 real orthogonal transformations @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the three - dimensional spin spaces of the spins  1 and 2 , respectively . a real orthogonal transformation is composed of rotation and inversion operations , but inversion operations can not be performed by unitary transformations . therefore , we remove the inversion operations from the real orthogonal transformation of the singular value decomposition and restrict ourselves only to the rotation operations , which means @xmath40 . in other words",
    ", we rotate @xmath41 with @xmath38 and @xmath42 with @xmath39",
    ". then we can transform @xmath43 into the antiferromagnetic cases @xmath33 or the ferromagnetic cases @xmath34 , with the other elements @xmath44 put to zero . here",
    ", we choose the @xmath45-axis so that @xmath46 is the least of @xmath47 .",
    "thus , lemma  1 is proved .",
    "let us show an example in the case of the @xmath48  model with the @xmath45-component of the dm interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the real coupling coefficients and @xmath52 is the @xmath45-component of the dm interaction . in the case of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ,",
    "we can transform @xmath56 into @xmath57 by rotating the spin 1 by @xmath58 degrees around the @xmath45-axis , namely into @xmath59 this is an antiferromagnetic heisenberg interaction . to attain this result , first",
    ", the singular value decomposition transforms @xmath60 into @xmath61 by rotating the spin 1 by @xmath62 degrees around the @xmath45-axis and inverting the @xmath45-axis of the spin .",
    "next , we remove the inversion of the @xmath45-axis because it can not be performed by unitary operations , and thereby transform @xmath56 into @xmath63 . by changing the rotation angle from @xmath62 to @xmath58 , we can invert the signs of @xmath64 and @xmath65 and arrive at @xmath66 .    in the following ,",
    "based on lemma 1 , we always use the diagonalized form  ( [ diagform ] ) of the interaction parameters with @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "we now have all the necessary ingredients to state the main theorems .",
    "in the present section , we analytically discuss the optimization problem .",
    "the main conclusion of the present section is that the negativity is maximized by the parameters @xmath67 .",
    "the optimizing parameter @xmath68 must be very large at high temperatures , whereas it may be @xmath69 at low temperatures .",
    "let us first discuss the optimization problem in the high - temperature limit .",
    "_ theorem  1_. in the high - temperature limit @xmath70 , the local parameters which maximize the entanglement @xmath29 are given in the form of @xmath67 .",
    "the optimizing value @xmath68 is given by the solution of the following equation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and the optimized entanglement @xmath73 asymptotically behaves as @xmath74 where we used eq .",
    "( [ happro ] ) upon moving from the first line to the second line .    the leading order of the solution of eq .  ( [ happro ] )",
    "is given by @xmath75 we can thereby obtain the following simpler asymptotes : @xmath76 that is , the optimizing value @xmath68 depends only on the temperature and the optimized negativity decays in the form @xmath77 in the limit @xmath70 . in appendix",
    "a , we compare the asymptotes of eqs .",
    "( [ happro ] ) and ( [ nappro ] ) with those of eqs .",
    "( [ theorem1 ] ) and ( [ theorem1n ] )    _ proof_. we prove theorem  1 in the following steps .",

    "the entanglement of the state comes from perturbations to the pure state .",
    "then , we calculate the negativity approximately by perturbation method in lemma  4 . using this expression",
    ", we finally solve the maximization problem for each local parameter .",
    "first , we determine a lower bound of the optimizing value @xmath68 and prove that the optimized thermal state is a nearly pure state . for this purpose , we prove the following lemma  2 .",
    "_ lemma  2_. a necessary condition for the existence of the entanglement in the high - temperature limit under a fixed interaction hamiltonian @xmath9 is given by @xmath80 this lemma  2 shows that @xmath79 is a lower bound of the optimizing value of @xmath68 .    _",
    "proof_. we firstly prove that we need a non - zero value of @xmath81 for the existence of the entanglement in the high - temperature limit @xmath70 . in other words , we need @xmath82 at least of order @xmath83 . in order to show this , we consider a general necessary condition for the existence of the entanglement given by  @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 are the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath86 in the non - ascending order ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "let us define the eigenvalues of @xmath88 as @xmath89 in the non - descending order ( @xmath90 ) .",

    "if we let @xmath96 be of the same order as @xmath97 , the left - hand side of ( [ necessary2 ] ) would vanish in the limit @xmath95 and ( [ necessary ] ) would not be satisfied . therefore , we have to make @xmath96 much greater than @xmath97 , and then the eigenvalues of @xmath98 should converge to those of @xmath96 , @xmath99 in the limit @xmath100 . with @xmath101 and @xmath102 ,",
    "the inequality ( [ necessary2 ] ) reduces to the following inequality : @xmath103 this inequality means that we need a non - zero value of @xmath81 in the high - temperature limit @xmath70 . in other words ,",
    "we need to make @xmath82 grow as @xmath83 at least , in order for the entanglement to exist in the limit @xmath70 .",
    "next , we derive an approximation of the density matrix , and then obtain eq .",
    "( [ lemma2 ] ) by utilizing the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite , which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the entanglement . in the present optimization problem ,",
    "we fix @xmath9 to a constant matrix , and therefore we have @xmath104 in the high - temperature limit .",
    "we thereby work in the first - order approximation with respect to @xmath105 : @xmath106 where @xmath107 , and we let @xmath108 with @xmath109 as well as @xmath110 here , @xmath111 are the eigenvalues of @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 are the corresponding eigenstates , @xmath19 .    we then utilize the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the entanglement , @xmath115 .",
    "this has been proved  @xcite to be equivalent to the peres - horodecki criterion  @xcite . in the following discussion , among the various terms of the expansion of @xmath116",
    ", we compare the values of the products including off - diagonal elements ( pod ) with that of the product of the diagonal elements ( pd ) , which has a positive value .",
    "then a necessary condition for @xmath115 is that pod is greater than or of the same order as the pd . to analyze the order of the pd and the pods , we express @xmath28 in the basis @xmath114 and focus on the main terms for @xmath117 and @xmath118 : @xmath119 where @xmath120 are determined from eqs .",

    "note that on the diagonal of eq .  , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ perturbation ] ) is neglected in comparison to the first term .",
    "then we compare the orders of the pods with that of the pd .",
    "the pd is given by @xmath121 , whereas each pod includes at least two off - diagonal elements .",
    "the maximum of the absolute value of the pods is of order @xmath122 , which comes from the product @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , it is necessary for @xmath115 that @xmath122 is greater or of order 1 , which is the order of pd . by taking the logarithm of @xmath122 , we can obtain the following inequality as a necessary condition : @xmath124 where we utilized ( [ betahc ] ) in deriving the third inequality and used the fact @xmath95 in deriving the last inequality .",
    "thus , lemma  2 is proved for @xmath117 and @xmath118 . for @xmath125 or @xmath126 , some of the eigenvalues of @xmath127 are degenerate , which means that @xmath128 can be equal to @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ fij ] ) , and @xmath130 is not of the same form as that of eq .",

    "proof_. let us prove eq .",
    "( [ degenerate ] ) in the case of @xmath135 .",
    "the proof for @xmath136 is almost the same .",
    "we start from the main term of @xmath137 for @xmath138 in the representation in the basis @xmath114 : @xmath139 where we used the fact that at @xmath140 the eigenvalues of @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ fij ] ) are degenerate as @xmath141 .    in order to optimize the negativity ,",
    "we necessarily consider the region @xmath142 as is given in lemma  2 .",

    "the other elements are approximately of order @xmath152 .",
    "we therefore break up the matrix ( [ zeta1 ] ) in the form @xmath153 where @xmath154 , and therefore the first term is the dominant term of order @xmath152 , whereas the second term is of order @xmath155 .",
    "the eigenvalues of the dominant term are @xmath156 and the corresponding eigenstates are @xmath19 .",
    "a negative eigenvalue can appear when the degeneracy of the two zero eigenvalues of the states @xmath157 and @xmath158 is resolved by perturbation .",
    "then , the level repulsion between them makes one of them positive and the other negative .",
    "however , the first - order perturbation of the second term of eq .   dose not resolve the degeneracy of the zero eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , the negative eigenvalue must be produced in a higher order of @xmath132 in the case of @xmath159 .",

    "the transition from the low - temperature phase to the high - temperature phase means that the enhancement of the entanglement due to the increase of the purity becomes predominant compared with the entanglement decay caused by the magnetic decoupling .",
    "we have analytically and numerically rigorously studied thermal states of quantum systems where two qubits interact under a local hamiltonian @xmath10 and have determined the local hamiltonian @xmath10 which maximizes the thermal entanglement under a fixed interaction . as a result , we have found that the interaction hamiltonian can be transformed into the @xmath396-exchange interactions whose parameters are either antiferromagnetic as @xmath33 or ferromagnetic as @xmath34 and that the optimizing local hamiltonian always takes the form of @xmath397 , where @xmath68 depends on the temperature .",
    "in addition , we have proved that the optimized entanglement does not vanish at any temperatures and decays slowly according to @xmath77 at high temperatures .",
