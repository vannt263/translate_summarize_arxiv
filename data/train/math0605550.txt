    "the global theories of minimal surfaces in euclidean @xmath1-space @xmath2 and constant mean curvature ( cmc ) @xmath0 surfaces in hyperbolic @xmath1-space @xmath3 are well understood , as they possess representation formulas using meromorphic functions and so benefit from the theory of complex analysis .",
    "in contrast to this , the global theory of spacelike maximal surfaces in minkowski @xmath1-space @xmath4 and spacelike cmc @xmath0 surfaces in de sitter @xmath1-space @xmath5 are not well explored yet , even though they possess similar representation formulas .",
    "this is perhaps because the only complete spacelike maximal immersions in @xmath4 and spacelike cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath5 are flat and totally umbilic .",
    "so to have an interesting global theory about these surfaces , we need to consider a wider class of surfaces than just complete and immersed ones .    recently , umehara and yamada defined such a category of spacelike maximal surfaces with certain kinds of singularities and named them `` maxfaces '' @xcite .",
    "then they constructed numerous examples by a transferring method from minimal surfaces in @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , kim and yang discovered an interesting example of a maxface , which has genus @xmath0 with two embedded ends , even though there does not exist such an example as a complete minimal immersion in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , fernndez and lpez and souam have investigated maximal surfaces with conical singularities @xcite .    the author defined spacelike cmc @xmath0 surfaces with certain kinds of singularities as an analogue of maxfaces , naming them `` cmc @xmath0 faces '' , and constructed many examples by transferring from reducible cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "also , lee and yang investigated spacelike cmc @xmath0 surfaces of genus zero with two and three ends @xcite .",
    "however , every surface constructed in @xcite and @xcite was topologically a sphere with finitely many points removed . given all of this , it is natural to consider whether or not there exist examples with positive genus .    for cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath3 , rossman and sato constructed genus @xmath0 catenoid cousins by a numerical method @xcite",

    "an analogous osserman - type inequality for cmc @xmath0 faces in @xmath5 was shown in @xcite , in the case that the ends are complete and elliptic .",
    "the examples here satisfy equality in the osserman - type inequality , even though some of them do not have elliptic ends .",
    "( we define elliptic and hyperbolic and parabolic ends in section [ sec : prelim ] . ) osserman - type inequalities for cmc @xmath0 immersions in @xmath3 and maxfaces in @xmath4 can be found in @xcite and @xcite",
