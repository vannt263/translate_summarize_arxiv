    "in this section we generalize the quandle 2-cocycle invariants defined in @xcite to the finite rack case .    the rack counting invariants described in the last section work by taking cardinalities of sets of homomorphisms which are unchanged by reidemeister moves . however , a set is more than a cardinality , and we would like to recover as much information from these sets of homomorphisms as possible .    in @xcite , the idea is to associate a sum in an abelian group @xmath115 called a _ boltzmann weight _ to a quandle - colored knot diagram in such a way that the sum does not change under reidemeister moves .",

    "@xmath122    this weighting rule has the advantage that the contributions from the two crossings in a reidemeister type ii move cancel , so the sum is automatically invariant under ii moves :    @xmath123    we also note that the weighting rule gives invariance under the doubled type i moves required for blackboard - framed isotopy :    @xmath124    the condition for the sum to be unchanged by reidemeister iii moves is pictured below . @xmath125 this turns out to be the condition that @xmath126 is a cocycle in the second rack cohomology @xmath127 of the rack @xmath0 with coefficients in @xmath115 .",
