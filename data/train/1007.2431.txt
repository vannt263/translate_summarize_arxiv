    "the mr of lasb@xmath0 reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrhall ] is linear in field above 3 t@xcite , is highly anisotropic , and does not saturate in fields of up to 45 t. these features led to the suggestion that lasb@xmath0 is useful as a magnetoresistive sensor for high field applications@xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed over the past 35 years to explain anomalously linear mrs which were observed in disordered semiconductors@xcite , two - dimensional ( 2d ) heterostructures@xcite , and elemental metals@xcite .",
    "the purported causes include the nucleation of charge density wave ( cdw ) distortions with mr due to quantum fluctuations about the cdw@xcite ground state and/or a magnetic breakdown of the cdw gap@xcite , high field quantization effects@xcite , or singular scattering mechanisms@xcite . while lasb@xmath0 does not appear to be in the extreme quantum limit at the fields of fig .",
    "[ fig : mrhall ] , and there is no indication that conditions are favorable for strongly singular scattering , it remains possible that there is a cdw ordering .",
    "this possibility is supported by the fact that nbse@xmath0 and tase@xmath0 , two prototypical cdw systems@xcite , have similar crystal structures and linear mrs@xcite .",
    "however , measurements of the resistivity , @xmath7 , showed no transitions or unusual temperature , @xmath8 , dependencies that one usually associates with a cdw transition@xcite and photoemission@xcite and neutron diffraction measurements@xcite did not reveal any phase transitions .    here",

    "we find an extraordinarily wide transition to an anisotropic sc phase that sharpens with pressure and which suggests that sc phase fluctuations determine @xmath3 .",

    "the crystal structure displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct ] was determined from single crystal x - ray diffraction .",
    "optical experiments were performed using spectroscopic ellipsometry at 0.75 - 3.7 ev in combination with reflectivity measurements from 7 mev to 0.85 mev . because there is no significant difference between the 300 and 20 k reflectivity spectra in the mid - infrared energy range , the ellipsometry data were obtained at room temperature .",
    "all measurements were performed on freshly polished crystals introduced into a vacuum cryostat for the @xmath8-dependent measurements and kept in a flow of dry nitrogen for room @xmath8 experiments in order to avoid the contamination of the surface . to obtain the absolute value of the reflectivity a reference gold layer was evaporated _ in situ _ on the sample surface . from the frequency , @xmath10 ,",
    "dependent reflectivity and ellipsometry data we derived the real part of the conductivity using a kramers - kronig consistent variational fitting procedure@xcite .",
    "reflectivity measurements were carried out in @xmath5s of up to 7 t at a few selected @xmath8s .",

    "hall effect and @xmath7 measurements were performed on single crystals with electrical contacts made using silver epoxy employing lock - in techniques at 17 or 27 hz at @xmath8s between 0.05 and 300 k. some measurements reported here were made at the national high magnetic field laboratory in continuous fields of up to 45 t ( 35 t ) for @xmath7 ( hall effect ) measurements .",

    "thus , our data suggest that the mr is a scattering induced effect which is not related to the formation of a cdw induced energy gap or variations of the electronic structure with @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , our measurements reveal an unusual , anisotropic , sc transition that is very broad in @xmath8 that is incomplete down to our lowest @xmath8s in the majority of crystals .",
    "the application of @xmath27 sharpens the transition dramatically , inducing a full sc transition .",
    "similar sc phase transitions have been previously observed in layered materials such as 2h - tas@xmath0 where the width of the transition was associated with the competition of a cdw phase@xcite .",
    "in lasb@xmath0 we have found no indication of a cdw , or other energy gap inducing , phases that compete with superconductivity either in @xmath20 above 20 k nor in @xmath28 at any @xmath8 .",
    "this suggests a different cause for the wide sc transition we observe . because the transition sharpens with pressure , and because of the long @xmath17 for charge carriers moving parallel to the ab planes , we do not believe impurity or crystal defects to be important .",
    "instead we suggest that the sc phase in lasb@xmath0 at @xmath29 may be phase fluctuation limited as in the underdoped high @xmath3 sc cuprates .",
