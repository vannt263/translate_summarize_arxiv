    "there are various reasons to choose a particular basis , and each basis has advantages and disadvantages .",

    "that is , @xmath6 , the identity matrix .",
    "conversely , any basis @xmath7 is dual to some basis @xmath8 of @xmath0 .",
    "it is the dual map @xmath9 that extracts information from the functions that is of particular interest here , which arguably plays a more prominent role than the basis @xmath8 itself .",
    "this process allows one to consider the _ information _ we are trying to capture as our primary goal .",
    "the above concepts are well - known and well - studied . in this paper , we are interested in investigating bases for _ subspaces _ @xmath10 of @xmath0 that are dual to _ subsets _ of the functionals in the map @xmath9 .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath3 $ ] are linearly independent on the n - dimensional space @xmath0 , and @xmath10 is an m - dimensional subspace of @xmath0 with @xmath11 .",
    "then , given an injective map @xmath12 \\rightarrow [ 1:n]$ ] , our questions are :    1 .",
    "is the subset @xmath13 $ ] of @xmath14 linearly independent on @xmath10 ?",
    "2 .   if linearly independent , what is the basis @xmath15 for @xmath10 that is dual to @xmath16 in the sense that @xmath17 .",
    "3 .   what are the properties of this dual basis .    in this paper",
    "we consider the action of subsets of functionals for certain basis on _ subspaces _ of the original space .",
    "this allows us to view how the subspace looks according to information on the whole space . in some sense",
    ", we are addressing the question `` how do you approximate with less ( or not enough ) information ? '' but it is not always possible to construct such bases , because the functionals are not always _ linearly independent _ on the subspace .",
    "for example , the only subset of @xmath18 $ ] that is linearly independent on @xmath19 $ ] is @xmath20 $ ] , not @xmath21 $ ] or @xmath22 $ ] . as we will see in this paper ,",
    "the situation is different in the bernstein basis .",
    "it is the objective of this paper to determine if dual bases exist for certain subspaces of polynomial spaces , and if so to compute and characterize these bases , and then determine their properties . in particular , we show that in the bernstein basis for @xmath23 , any @xmath24-selection of the dual functionals are linearly independent on @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , by choosing a particular symmetric choice of the functionals , we show that the corresponding dual basis converge to the lagrange polynomial basis .",
    "later , we derive certain approximation results concerning quasi - interpolation and a bernstein - type operator .",
    "as defined above , @xmath0 is a vector space of dimension @xmath1 with basis @xmath8 and dual map @xmath9 , and @xmath10 a subspace of @xmath0 of dimension @xmath26 , @xmath27 , with basis @xmath28 . for @xmath29 , we have @xmath30 for some coefficient sequences @xmath31 and @xmath32 . applying the dual basis , we have @xmath33 hence , @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
