    "ag pegasi ( ag peg ) is a symbiotic binary consisting of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a red giant ( spectral type m3 ) .",
    "a continuing slow decline of the far - uv and near - uv continuum is noticed by kenyon , proga , & keyes ( 2001 ) .",
    "they claim that the eruption of the hot component in ag peg may be the slowest classical nova outburst ever recorded .",
    "ag peg evolution was followed by the observations ( kenyon et al 1993 , kenyon et al .",
    "2001 ) and modeled by the interpretation of the line and continuum spectra ( e.g. contini 1997 ) .",
    "the collision of the winds from the hot star and the red giant in symbiotic binaries creates a complex hydrodynamic structure ( nussbaumer 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the emitting gas within the system is then ionised and heated both by the photoionising flux from the hot star and by shocks . in a previous paper ( contini 1997 , hereafter paper i )",
    "the observed continuum and line spectra from ag peg at phases earlier than @xmath1 = 7.12 , have been explained by composite models accounting both for photoionisation and shocks .",
    "indeed , the complex structure of the system requires schematic models which represent roughly the real picture .",
    "the consistency of calculation results for the line spectra in the uv and in the optical ranges , as well as for the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the continuum leads to a better understanding of the physical characteristics of the system .    following the results of paper i ,",
    "two shock fronts are created at collision of the winds between the stars , one propagating in reverse toward the wd and the other propagating outwards the system .",
    "moreover , recent observations of symbiotic novae show that spectra are also emitted from downstream of shocks propagating outside the system and eventually merging with the ism ( contini & formiggini 2001 ) . at phase 7.05 of ag peg",
    "the expanding shock has already passed over the red giant and slightly accelerates propagating in the atmosphere of the red giant , opposite to the wd , where the density gradient is decreasing .",
    "new observations are presented by kenyon et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter kpk01 ) .",
    "they provide optical and uv spectra at phases 7.34 - 9.44 , acquired with faint object spectrograph ( fos ) on board of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) between late 1993 and late 1996 .",
    "low resolution optical spectra with the fast spectrograph mounted at the f.i .",
    "whipple observatory 1.5-m telescope are also reported .",
    "after an accurate analysis of the data , kpk01 conclude that `` if the hot component emits enough high energy photons to account for the forbidden line fluxes , mechanical heating from the colliding winds may explain the high electron temperature . _",
    "a detailed photoionisation calculation which includes shock excitation would test this proposal . _ '' responding to kpk01 , i present further modelling of ag peg on the basis of their observational data at the latest phases ( @xmath1 = 7.39 - 9.44 ) , adopting for the calculations the code suma ( viegas & contini 1994 , paper i ) .",
    "suma calculates the emitted spectrum from the gas , accounting for the coupled effect of shock and photoionisation from an external source .",
    "the spectra in the different phases are considered in sect .",
    "the models and the modelling process are presented in sects . 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "results are discussed in sect .",
    "5 and concluding remarks appear sect .",
    "6087 , , and .,width=317 ]    line fluxes observed by kpk01 were corrected for e(b - v)=0.1 .",
    "there are several values for e(b - v ) in the range 0.08 - 0.15 obtained by different methods ( tomov , tomova , & raikova 1998 , penston & allen 1985 , etc . ) .",
    "some significant line fluxes and line ratios corrected for e(b - v ) = 0.1 are given in fig . 1 as function of the phase .",
    "1 shows that /  and h@xmath2 /  at phases @xmath1 @xmath3 8.8 are higher than case b values . a higher reddening correction of the spectra",
    "is not predicted because it would lead to very high values of the far uv line fluxes .",
    "moreover , kpk01 notice that the depth of the 2200   absorption feature does not vary with phase and is consistent with e(b - v ) = 0.1 .",
    "finally , the best fit of the calculated continuum sed to the data of the ir dust bump at early phases ( paper i ) corresponds to a relatively low gas - to - dust ratio , d / g = 2 . 10@xmath4 by number .",
    "we would like to investigate the origin of such high values of /  and h@xmath2/. we will refer to radiative transfer effects of hi , to collision excitation of h lines , and , more specifically , to the effect of the viewing angle of the emitting nebulae .",
    "recall that densities in the emitting nebulae of symbiotic systems are generally high ( @xmath5 10@xmath6 3 ) , sufficiently high that some self absorption occurs in the balmer lines .",
    "this leads to a marked strengthening of the  line relative to the rest of the balmer series . in case b , as the optical thickness of ly@xmath0  increases , the first effect in the decrement occurs when  converts into   ( cox & mathews 1969 ) .",
    "particularly , for large optical thickness of the ly@xmath0  line , the increase of the  optical thickness leads to an increase of both /  and h@xmath2/  ( cox & mathews 1969 , fig .",
    "1 ) . in fact ,  is mostly scattered because any l@xmath7 photons it forms are quickly absorbed and converted back to , while  is absorbed and converts to + p@xmath0 .    moreover , drake & ulrich ( 1980 ) claim that /  ratios greater than 10 can be obtained with optical depths of the order of 100 or more by balmer self - absorption alone .",
    "particularly , conditions which tend to produce very steep balmer decrements are found to be large optical depths in , low photoionisation rates , and values of the electron density between 10@xmath8 3 and 10@xmath9 3 ( see also krolik & mckee 1978 ) .    in the case of symbiotic systems ,",
    "collisional processes are very effective , because shock fronts are created by collision of the winds between the stars with velocities @xmath10 40 .",
    "such velocities correspond to temperatures @xmath10 20,000 k in the postshock region .",
    "higher velocities are actually observed leading to higher temperatures .",
    "collisional excitation increases with temperature and prevails for t @xmath10 20,000 k. collision strengths are @xmath11 e@xmath12 exp(- e@xmath13/kt ) ( contini & aldrovandi 1983 ) where e@xmath13 is the energy of the level .",
    "radiation from the hot star , on the other hand , can not heat the gas to @xmath10 20,000 k. so , high /  line ratios are predicted in the spectra emitted from shock dominated nebulae .",
    "it was shown in paper i that the spectra of ag peg at different epochs are emitted mainly by two nebulae : one in the downstream region of the shock front propagating in reverse towards the hot source and the other downstream of the shock front expanding outwards in the atmosphere of the red giant opposite to the hot source . in particular , the gas is collisionally heated in the outer region of the expanding nebula , while is heated by radiation in the internal region of the same nebula facing the hot source .",
    "so , collision dominated spectra will prevail at photometric minimum .",
    "1 shows that the /   line ratio has a rough maximum at phase @xmath14 8.5 , which could be due to collisional effects .",
    "we will come back to this point after modelling the spectra .",
    "when the system evolves through the photometric minimum and the hot source is occulted , the heii lines that are emitted by a photoionised gas , should strongly decline . on the contrary , fig .",
    "1 shows that the heii 4686 flux does not change with phase more than about 22% throughout the period between phases 8.33 and 9.44 .",
    "this behavior reveals that nebulae heated and ionised by radiation contribute to the spectra near maximum as well as near photometric minimum .",
    "suma calculates the emitted spectrum from a gas in a plane parallel geometry .",
    "the nebula between the stars is ionised and heated by both black body radiation from the wd and the ( reverse ) shock .",
    "therefore , radiation reaches the very front edge of the shocked nebula . on the other hand , radiation and shock act on opposite edges of the nebula downstream of the expanding shock which propagates in the red giant atmosphere .",
    "the input parameters are : the shock velocity , , the preshock density , 0 , the preshock magnetic field , 0 , the colour temperature of the hot star , , the ionisation parameter , u , the geometrical thickness of the emitting gaseous nebula , d , and the abundance of he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , a , and fe relative to h. for all models = 10@xmath15 k.    we calculated a large grid of models with the following criteria : to fit the most significant line ratios and to be consistent with the modelling reported in paper i which was for earlier photometric phases .",
    "three models were selected from the grid , m1 , m2 , and m3 .",
    "model m1 represents the nebula in the downstream region of the shock propagating in reverse toward the wd .",
    "the downstream nebula , facing the red giant , is however close to the wd and the photoinising flux from the hot source reaches the shock front edge of the nebula .",
    "model m2 represents the nebula downstream of the shock propagating outwards the system in the red giant atmosphere opposite to the wd .",
    "the downstream nebula toward the wd is ionised and heated by both the shock and radiation from the hot source .",
    "model m3 shows the same shock characteristics of model m2 , but the emitting nebula downstream is not reached by the wd radiation flux .",
    "model m2 is radiation dominated ( rd ) , while m3 is shock dominated ( sd ) .",
    "model m3 being sd , the emitted spectrum is mainly excited by collision .",
    "recall that at later phases the shock front , merging with the ism , is disrupted by r - t and k - h instabilities ( see contini & formiggini 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , the ionising flux from the hot source will be eventually prevented from reaching the nebula in the downstream region of the shock by intervening matter .",
    "so , in the following , the `` reverse shock '' will refer to model m1 , the `` rd expanding shock '' to model m2 , and the `` sd expanding shock '' to model m3 .",
    "models m1 and m2 are matter - bound , while m3 is radiation bound ( see sect . 4.2 ) .",
    "the spectra contain lines in a relatively large range of ionisation levels and in the different wavelength domains .",
    "recall that the distribution of the fractional abundances of the ions downstream ( fig .",
    "2 ) depends on the input parameters and that the line intensities increase with the volume of gas emitting the corresponding ion and with the square of the density .",
    "the choice of the models depends on line ratios from different ionisation levels and is constrained by the general model of the ag peg system .    between @xmath1 = 7.05 and @xmath1 = 8.07 the conditions of the reverse shock ( between the two stars )",
    "could not change sensibly because the reverse shock is most likely a standing shock , so , we adopt input parameters at @xmath1 = 8.07 , = 60 and 0=10@xmath16 3 similar to those found at @xmath1 = 7.05 , = 40 and 0= 3 10@xmath16 3 ( paper i , table 4 , column 2 ) .",
    "in particular , 0 = 10@xmath17 gauss is adopted for m1 , which is suitable for isolated giants ( bohigas et al 1989 ) .",
    "the preshock density of the shock propagating throughout the atmosphere of the red giant in the present modelling ( 10@xmath18 3 ) is lower than that calculated at phases 7.05 - 7.12 ( paper i , table 4 ) by a large factor ( @xmath14 3000 ) .",
    "the shock velocity is slightly lower ( 100 at @xmath1=8.07 and 150 at @xmath1 = 7.05 ) . a lower 0",
    "indicates that the shock has proceeded towards the outskirts of the giant atmosphere . in about 820 days ( between @xmath1 = 7.05 and @xmath1 = 8.07 ) the shock expanding with a velocity of @xmath14 100",
    "could reach a distance of @xmath14 7 .",
    "10@xmath19 cm and is propagating outwards the system , merging with the ism .",
    "therefore , the preshock density of model m2 is low and the magnetic field is also reduced to 10@xmath20 gauss . both 0 and 0 are , nevertheless , still higher than found in the ism ( 1 - 10 3 , and 10@xmath21 - 10@xmath22 gauss , respectively ) .",
    "the relative abundances adopted at @xmath1 @xmath10 8.07 are c / h = 3.3 10@xmath20 , n / h",
    "= 5.3 10@xmath20 , o / h = 9.6 10@xmath20 , ne / h = 8.3 10@xmath21 , mg / h = 2 . 10@xmath21 , si / h = 3.3 10@xmath21 , s / h = 1.6 10@xmath21 , a / h = 6.3 10@xmath22 , and fe / h = 4 . 10@xmath21 , as were found at @xmath1=7.05 - 7.12 ( paper i , table 4 ) .",
    "mg / h is , however , similar to that at @xmath1 = 2.74 ( paper i , table 1 ) because at @xmath1 = 7.05 mg lines were not observed and the mg / h abundance ratio could not be determined by modelling the corresponding lines .",
    "the adopted relative abundances show that n / h and o / h ratios are higher than solar .",
    "relatively high values of n / h and o / h are characteristic of symbiotic systems .",
    "the modelling process of the spectra is roughly described in the following .",
    "recall that model m1 represents the reverse shock , m2 the rd expanding shock , and m3 the sd expanding shock .",
    "the results corresponding to single models are summed up adopting relative weights at each phase and the final results are compared with the observations .",
    "the relative weights which lead to the best fit of the observed spectra in the different epochs are related to the configuration of the system and are discussed in the next section .",
    "high ionisation - level lines ( e.g. nv , [ mgv ] , [ fevii ] , etc ) increase with the ionisation parameter u and with . in fact , the temperature downstream behind the shock front is @xmath11 @xmath23 .",
    "nv / civ ratios calculated by model m1 with relatively low velocities ( @xmath3 80 ) are lower than observed , therefore , they must be counter - balanced by line ratios higher than observed , calculated by the m2 model .",
    "the nv / civ ratio calculated by sd models ( m3 ) with @xmath14 100 is very low .",
    "so , the only way to obtain a high nv / civ is to adopt a high u in model m2 .",
    "this leads to high heii / civ line ratios .",
    "the nv / civ ratios calculated by a rd model with ionisation and shock acting on opposite edges , are not high enough , if the density is high ( 10@xmath16 3 ) . also , at high densities , the ratio of the intermediate ionisation - level lines ( niii / civ , siiii / civ , and ciii]/civ ) would be higher than observed by a factor @xmath5 10 .",
    "high densities are thus rejected for model m2 .",
    "this is consistent with the previous discussion ( sect .",
    "3 ) , namely , that the rd expanding shock propagates in a low density medium .",
    "low ionisation - level line ratios ( e.g. cii]/civ and mgii / civ ) are low for models m1 and m2 ( table 1 ) .",
    "low ionisation - level lines are high in sd models , therefore , model m3 must be accounted for .",
    "the relatively high cii]/civ and mgii / civ ratios calculated by m3 counter - balance in the averaged spectra the low values found by models m1 and m2 .",
    "a large grid of models is calculated in order to achieve the best fit of all the line ratios .",

    "2 shows that the temperature throughout the nebulae never decreases below 10@xmath6 k downstream of the reverse shock ( top diagram ) .",

    "= 8.07 we see almost all of the shock fronts , internal and external to the system ( fig .",
    "the distance of the reverse shock from the white dwarf , r@xmath31 , is of the order of the binary separation ( in paper i it is found that the front is very close to the red giant surface ) , so , we adopt r@xmath31 = 5 10@xmath32 cm ; the radius of the rd expanding front is r@xmath33(@xmath1=8.07)= r@xmath33(@xmath1=7.05)+@xmath34 r , where @xmath34 r is the distance covered by the shock front between phases 8.07 and 7.05 .",
    "then , r@xmath33 = 3.2 10@xmath35 cm ( paper i ) + 7 10@xmath19 cm ( sect .",
    "4 ) is @xmath14 4 10@xmath35 cm .",
    "actually , ( r@xmath33/r@xmath31)@xmath23 @xmath14 6400 at @xmath1 = 8.07 is lower than w(m2)/w(m1 ) = 1.2 10@xmath6 by a factor @xmath3 2 . the ratios of the weights which appear in table 2 are determined by the best fit of the calculated to the observed data .",
    "the discrepancy by a factor of @xmath3 2 indicates that the radiation emitted by the reverse shock is slightly absorbed by the outer atmosphere of the red giant . at later phases , @xmath1 = 8.33 and @xmath1 = 9.27",
    ", the radiation intersects the red giant at angles that depend on the phase angle , and the path length throughout the red giant , l = 2 r@xmath36 cos @xmath0 ( r@xmath36 is the radius of the red giant and @xmath0 is the angle between the binary system axis and the viewing direction from earth ) , is higher at @xmath1=8.33 than at @xmath1=9.27 .",
    "so , at @xmath1=9.27 the radiation from the reverse shock is less absorbed than at @xmath1=8.33 , in agreement with the trend of the w(m2)/w(m1 ) ratio that is 10@xmath24 at @xmath1=9.27 and is 1.5 10@xmath24 at @xmath1=8.33 .",
    "the trend is clearly depending on the phase angle , however , the trend does not depend only on the angle because the radius of the expanding shock is not symmetric around the system ( see nussbaumer 2000 , fig .",
    "1 ) .    regarding the sd shock",
    ", the ratio of the relative weights w(m3)/w(m2 ) does not follow any specific trend , because it depends on fragmentation of matter and on the filling factor .",
    "also those ratios were chosen by the best fit to the data .",
    "considering that the ag peg system is very complex , we have focused on the most significant lines , e.g. nv 1240 , civ 1550 , heii 1640 , ciii ] 1908 , cii ] 2325 , etc . in the uv , and heii 4686 in the optical range .",
    "niv ] 1486 is overestimated by the calculations .",
    "oi 1305 , hei 4471 and mgii are underestimated by a large factor .",
    "the contribution from a model corresponding to a large low temperature region could improve this result .",
    "[ nev ] 3426/ civ line ratio is overpredicted .",
    "notice , however , that this ratio refers to lines emitted from one or two different nebulae , indicating that more model components should be considered .",
    "the same is valid for the [ fevii ] 6087 /civ line ratio . in this case , however , some iron could be locked into dust grains .",
    "a slightly lower n / h could improve the fit of the nv 1240 and niv ] 1486 line ratios to civ , particularly at phase 9.44 .",
    "n / h approaching to the ism value , and the relatively low 0 and 0 adopted for models m2 and m3 , confirm that the merging process is taking place .    in the averaged spectra we found /@xmath3 3 , lower than the observed line ratios , because the weights of m1 and m2 models are relatively high .",
    "a possible explaination is given by shore ( 1992 ) who claims that in a moving medium with an internal velocity gradient , the optical depth of the line @xmath34@xmath37",
    "@xmath14 @xmath34v/(dv / dl ) .",
    "@xmath34v=@xmath34@xmath38 , where @xmath34@xmath38 is the doppler width of a line with rest frequency @xmath39 .",
    "the reduction of the velocity gradient causes a rapid increase in the line opacity , even if the density has dropped enough as to make the equivalent static line profile completely optically thin .",
    "indeed , a velocity gradient is predicted in the outer atmosphere of the red giant . adopting = 150 at @xmath1 = 7.12 ( contini 1997 ) ,",
    "= 100 at the latest epochs , and dl=10@xmath19 cm , @xmath34@xmath37 should increase by a factor @xmath5 10@xmath40 , leading to higher /  ( see sect .",
    "2 ) .    we can now compare the luminosities of the lines calculated by the models with those observed by kpk01 .",
    "considering , for instance [ nev ] 3426 at @xmath1 = 8.07 , the calculated luminosity is @xmath14 3 10@xmath41 erg s@xmath42 while the observed one ( kpk01 , table 4 ) is 4 10@xmath43 erg s@xmath42 adopting a distance to earth , d=800 pc .",
    "this line is mainly emitted from the nebula corresponding to model m1 .",
    "a better fit to the observed luminosity could be obtained adopting 0=3 10@xmath16 3 instead of 10@xmath16 3 for m1 .",
    "the preshock density used at @xmath1 = 7.05 ( paper i , table 4 ) was 3 10@xmath16 3 .",
    "the distance of the sd expanding nebula from the center of the binary system , r@xmath44 , at @xmath1=9.44 is obtained comparing the luminosities of calculated and observed cii ] lines . from cii]@xmath45",
    "@xmath46 d@xmath23 = cii]@xmath47 @xmath46 r@xmath48 , r@xmath44 results @xmath14 10@xmath49 cm .",
    "the cii ] line is considered because it is emitted mainly from the outer sd nebula at photometric minimum .",
    "the distance is larger by a factor @xmath5 2 than the distance of the rd expanding nebula corresponding to model m2 .",
    "even if the rd and sd expanding shocks are at different distances from the system center , they may belong to the same wave .",
    "in fact , the `` fingers '' created by r - t and k - h instabilities at the shock front can be elongated up to a large fraction of the shock front radius ( see contini & formiggini 2001 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the interpretation of the data by a relatively small number of models is sound , even if approximated .",
    "anyway , some interesting results follow .",
    "table 3    relative contributions ( in % ) to the line intensities    the relative contribution of the emitting nebulae to each line is shown in table 3 . the weight of models m2 and m3 , representing the nebulae propagating outwards in the atmosphere of the red giant , relative to the weight of the nebula corresponding to the reverse shock between the stars increases with the angle determined by the phase fraction ( .07 , .27 , .33 , and .44 ) , indicating that the external nebula is not present around the whole system , but only in the region opposite to the wd .",
    "the nebula downstream of the reverse shock dominates at @xmath1 = 8.07 except for a few lines ( siiii ] , ciii ] , cii ] , and mgii ) .",
    "a large contribution to these lines comes from the sd expanding shock .",
    "the rd expanding shock contributes partly to niv , [ nev ] , and to [ fevii ] .",
    "the relative contribution of the three nebulae to the lines are similar at @xmath1 = 8.33 and at @xmath1 = 9.27 , the reverse shock being less dominant and indicating that the relative contributions of the nebulae depend on the viewing angle of the system rather than on the phase . at both phases 8.33 and 9.27",
    "the rd expanding shock is dominating for most of the lines ( nv , heii 1640 , niv , [ mgv ] , [ nev ] , heii 3203 , [ nev ] 3426 , hi 4340 , heii 4686 , [ fevii ] , and ) . the sd expanding shock dominates the low ionisation level lines .    at @xmath1 = 9.44 the contribution from the reverse shock becomes negligible because the nebula between the stars is occulted by the red giant .",
    "the high ionisation level lines are produced mainly by the rd expanding shock and low ionisation level lines come from the sd nebula .",
    "the relative contribution of the nebula between the stars to the heii 1640 line decreases monotonically with phase fractions .07 , .27 , .33 , and .44 on the other hand , the relative contributions of m2 to nv 1240 are 14.8% , 61.4% , 68.75% , and 99.0% , at the same angles , respectively .",
    "concluding , the evolution of the spectra is more likely related to the viewing angle of the system , not particularly to the phase between @xmath1 = 8.07 and @xmath1 = 9.44 .",
    "we do not have data relative to viewing angles higher than 0.44 , which could hopefully strengthen the results .",
    "it is now possible to understand the trend of the lines shown in fig .",
    "table 3 shows that the contribution from the sd shocked nebula ( m3 ) to  is only a few % , therefore , the calculated /  line ratio is likely to be @xmath14 3 throughout the whole period between phase 8.07 and 9.44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed value is @xmath10 5 towards photometric minimum .",
    "this high value may be explained considering that the rd expanding shock is represented by a composite model which accounts for both the photoionisation by the wd and the shock . the side of the emitting nebula facing the observer at photometric minimum is shock dominated ( fig .",
    "2 , middle diagram ) .",
    "so , in this phase we see mainly  and  fluxes from this side of the nebula , which are produced by collisional ionisation . moreover , the optical depth in the radiation dominated region is high ( see sect .",
    "4.1 ) leading to high /.",
    "heii 4686 and [ fevii ] do not show a periodic change with phase because a large fraction of these lines is emitted by the nebula downstream of the rd expanding shock .",
    "so , the decrease of the reverse shock contribution at phases approaching the photometric minimum is compensated by the large contribution from the rd expanding shock .",
    "these lines show , therefore , less impressive variability up to @xmath1 @xmath10 9.2 . at @xmath1 = 9.27",
    "the calculated f@xmath50 is 0.11 , while at @xmath1 = 9.44 f@xmath50 = 0.06 .",
    "the decrease of the calculated flux between these two phases is in agreement with the observed decrease shown in fig . 1 after @xmath1 = 9.27 .",
    "hei 4471 is emitted mainly by the sd expanding shock ( m3 ) and the flux is very low , f@xmath51= 2 10@xmath21 .",
    "therefore , this line flux shows a maximum in fig . 1 when the system is near maximum .",
    "the same is valid for h@xmath0 and .",
    "notice , however that hei 4471/civ line ratio is underpredicted by the models .",
    "all the lines show an asymmetric behaviour before and after maximum .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the emitting nebulae are not symmetric relative to the axis joining the center of the wd with the center of the red giant . in the hydrodynamical picture of symbiotic systems presented by nussbaumer ( 2000 , fig .",
    "1 left ) the wake is , in fact , strongly asymmetric , so that the emitting nebulae could partly disappear in some location at angles corresponding to high phase fractions .",
    "the analysis of the spectra from the hst and from the fast spectrograph at the whipple observatory reported by kenyon et al ( 2001 ) at different phases leads to new results about the configuration of ag peg .",
    "the fast spectra contain both h@xmath0 and  lines , providing the tool for modelling the system at different phases .",
    "interestingly , the trend of the periodical variability of / , as well as the trend of the most significant lines indicate that different nebulae contribute to the final spectra .",
    "in particular , the high /   line ratios ( @xmath14 5 ) suggest that shock dominated models must be accounted for .",
    "moreover , the trend of the heii 4686 line variability with phase indicates that radiation dominated nebulae are strongly contributing to the spectra also near the photometric minimum .",
    "consistent modelling by the code suma , which accounts for the coupled effect of photoionisation from the hot star and shocks , shows that at least three nebulae provide the spectral components : 1 ) the nebula between the stars , downstream of the shock created by head - on collision of the winds , which propagates in reverse towards the wd , 2 ) the nebula downstream of the head - on - back shock expanding in the outskirts of the red giant atmosphere and reached by the photoionising flux from the wd , and 3 ) the nebula downstream of the same shock front which is shock dominated , i.e. it is not reached by the photoionising radiation flux . in fact , the matter in this region is very clumpy because the shock front is disrupted by r - t instability , and radiation from the wd is prevented from reaching the region by the intervening clumps in some locations .",
    "the fit of calculated to observed line ratios is acceptable enough to justify the choice of the models , so that the relative contribution of the different nebulae to the final spectra at different phases can be calculated for all the lines .",
    "it is found that the contribution of the nebula between the stars prevails for most of the lines near maximum ( @xmath1 = 8.07 ) , declining towards higher phases and even disappearing at phase 9.44 .",
    "low ionisation level lines ( e.g. cii ] and mgii ) are mainly emitted from the sd expanding nebula .",
    "the evolution of the spectra between phases 7.34 and 9.44 is more likely related with the viewing angle of the system , and not to the temporal evolution of the system .",
    "models m2 and m3 which represent the expanding shock are characterized by a relatively low preshock density and magnetic field , much lower than found by modelling ag peg at @xmath1 @xmath52 7.12 ( paper i ) .",
    "this suggests that the shock , expanding in the red giant atmosphere opposite to the wd , has already reached the outskirts of the system and is merging with the ism . at @xmath1 = 9.44 the expanding shock has swept up a large portion of matter with relatively low density .",
    "the line and continuum fluxes emitted from downstream the shock are @xmath11 n@xmath23 and , therefore , decrease as more is matter is swept up , leading to the slow decline of ag peg continuum and line fluxes observed by kpk01 .",
