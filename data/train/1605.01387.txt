    "mechanisms favoring the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas have become central focuses of evolutionary game theory in recent years @xcite .",
    "the dilemma of cooperation , which is characterized by conflicts of interest between individuals and groups , poses a significant challenge to models of evolution since many of these models predict that cooperation can not persist in the presence of exploitation by defectors @xcite .",
    "yet cooperation is widely observed in nature , and the spatial assortment that results from population structure is one element that can promote its emergence .",
    "in fact , spatial structure is among the most salient determinants of the evolutionary dynamics of a population @xcite .    in social dilemmas ,",
    "population structure can allow for the emergence of localized cooperative clusters that would normally be outcompeted by defectors in well - mixed populations @xcite .",
    "however , whether population structure promotes or suppresses cooperation depends on a number of factors such as the update rule , the type of social dilemma , and the spatial details of the structure ( which determines the extent of local competition ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , cooperation need not be favored in prisoner s dilemma interactions under all update rules @xcite . as a consequence , population structure should be considered in the context of the game and the underlying update rule .    in the donation game ,",
    "a cooperator ( @xmath0 ) pays a cost , @xmath1 , to provide the opponent with a benefit , @xmath2 , and a defector ( @xmath3 ) pays no cost and provides no benefit @xcite .",
    "provided @xmath4 , this game represents a prisoner s dilemma since then the unique nash equilibrium is mutual defection , but both players would prefer the payoff from mutual cooperation @xcite .",
    "in addition to representing one of the most important social dilemmas , the donation game also admits a simple way in which to quantify the efficiency of cooperation : the benefit - to - cost ratio , @xmath5 .",
    "as this ratio gets larger , the act of cooperation has a more profound effect on the opponent relative to the cost paid by the cooperator .",
    "as we shall see , for any configuration of cooperators and defectors , this ratio is a vital indicator of the evolutionary performance of cooperation .",
    "evolutionary graph theory is a framework for studying evolution in structured populations @xcite . in a graph - structured population ,",
    "the players reside on the vertices and the edges indicate who is a neighbor of whom .",
    "in fact , there are two types of neighborhoods : ( i ) those that generate payoffs (  interaction neighborhoods \" ) and ( ii ) those that are relevant for evolutionary updating (  dispersal neighborhoods \" ) .",
    "thus , an evolutionary graph is actually a pair of graphs consisting of an interaction graph and a dispersal graph @xcite . as in many other studies , we assume that the interaction and dispersal graphs are the same",
    ". other extensions of evolutionary graph theory involve dynamic graphs , which allow the population structure to change during evolutionary updating @xcite .",
    "our focus is on static , regular graphs of degree @xmath6 , meaning the population size , @xmath7 , is fixed and each player has exactly @xmath6 neighbors .",
    "we study two prominent update rules : birth - death ( bd ) and death - birth ( db ) . in both processes , players are arranged on a graph and accumulate payoffs by interacting with all of their neighbors .",
    "this payoff , @xmath8 , is then converted to fitness , @xmath9 , via @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the intensity of selection @xcite . for bd updating",
    "@xcite , a player is chosen with probability proportional to fitness for reproduction ; the offspring of this player then replaces a random neighbor ( who dies ) . for db updating @xcite",
    ", a player is chosen uniformly at random for death ; a neighbor of this player then reproduces ( with probability proportional to fitness ) and the offspring fills the vacancy . for each of these processes , we assume that @xmath12 is small , which means selection is weak .",
    "weak selection is often a biologically meaningful assumption since an individual might possess many traits ( strategies ) , and each trait makes only a small contribution to fitness @xcite .",
    "the effects of selection on fixation probability have been studied chiefly for states with just a single cooperator since , if the mutation rate is small , the process will reach a monomorphic state prior to the appearance of another cooperator through mutation @xcite .",
    "although small mutation rates are often reasonable from a biological standpoint @xcite , there are several reasons to study arbitrary cooperator configurations . even when starting from a state with a single cooperator , an evolutionary process typically transitions subsequently through states with many cooperators . from a mathematical standpoint , it is therefore natural to ask how selection affects the fixation probability of cooperators from each possible transient state that might arise in an evolutionary trajectory .",
    "furthermore , many - mutant states could arise through migration @xcite or environmental mutagenic agents @xcite , which , even when rare , might result in several cooperators entering the population at once . in the case of social networks",
    ", cooperators could arise through design rather than mutation or exploration ; if cooperators can be strategically planted within the population , then one can ask how to do so in order to maximize the chances that cooperators take over .",
    "therefore , the effects of selection on arbitrary numbers and configurations of cooperators and defectors play an important role in the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation .    when starting from a configuration with @xmath13 cooperators and @xmath14 defectors , weak selection is said to favor the evolution of cooperation ( on a regular graph ) if the probability that cooperators fixate exceeds @xmath15 if @xmath12 is sufficiently small but positive .",
    "this comparison is based on the fact that the fixation probability of @xmath13 cooperators for neutral drift ( @xmath16 ) is @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite show that , on large regular graphs of degree @xmath6 , selection favors the fixation of a single , randomly - placed cooperator under db updating as long as    @xmath17    @xcite show that for finite bi - transitive graphs of size @xmath7 and degree @xmath6 , the condition for selection to favor the fixation of a single cooperator is    @xmath18    bi - transitive graphs constitute a subset of regular graphs .    in another refinement of the ` @xmath19 ' result",
    ", @xcite shows that , for any @xmath13 with @xmath20 , selection favors cooperation when starting from a random configuration of @xmath13 cooperators and @xmath14 defectors on a regular graph of size @xmath7 and degree @xmath6 if and only if eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiorandom ] ) holds .",
    "( note that regularity is a weaker requirement on the population structure than bi - transitivity . )",
    "this ratio , which characterizes when selection increases the fixation probability of cooperators , is independent of the location of the mutants , despite the fact that the probability of fixation itself depends on the location @xcite . as the population size , @xmath7 , gets large , the critical benefit - to - cost ratio of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiorandom ] ) approaches @xmath6 , which recovers the result of @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to move beyond eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiorandom ] ) and give an explicit , computationally feasible critical benefit - to - cost ratio for any configuration of cooperators and defectors on any regular graph .    given the profusion of possible ways to structure a population of a fixed size , it quickly becomes difficult to determine when a population structure favors the evolution of cooperation .",
    "here , we provide a solution to this problem for bd and db updating on regular graphs .",
    "we show that , for any configuration of cooperators and defectors , ( i ) cooperation is never favored for bd updating , and ( ii ) for db updating , there exists a simple , explicit critical benefit - to - cost ratio that characterizes when selection favors the emergence of cooperation . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath7 is the population size and @xmath6 is the degree of the graph , then the complexity of calculating this ratio is @xmath21 , and , in particular , linear in @xmath7 .",
    "thus , while the calculations of fixation probabilities in structured populations are famously intractable @xcite , the determination of whether or not selection increases the probability of fixation , for weak selection , is markedly simpler .    in addition to providing a computationally feasible way of determining whether selection favors cooperation on a particular graph , our results highlight the importance of the initial configuration for the emergence of cooperation .",
    "depending on the graph , adding additional cooperators to the initial condition can either suppress or promote the evolution of cooperation .",
    "a careful choice of configuration of cooperators and defectors can minimize the critical benefit - to - cost ratio for selection to favor cooperation .",
    "if cooperation is not favored by selection in such a strategically chosen initial state , then it can not be favored under any other initial configuration . in this sense",
    ", there exists a configuration that is most conducive to the evolution of cooperation , which is not apparent from looking at single - cooperator configurations or random configurations with @xmath13 cooperators since these initial configurations need not minimize the critical benefit - to - cost ratio .",
    "let @xmath22 be a configuration of cooperators and defectors on a fixed regular graph of size @xmath7 and degree @xmath6 , and let @xmath23 denote the configuration consisting solely of cooperators . for the donation game , the probability that cooperators take over the population when starting from state @xmath22 may be viewed as a function of the selection intensity , @xmath24 .",
    "we consider here the following question : when does weak selection increase the probability that cooperators fixate ?",
    "in other words , when is @xmath25 for sufficiently small @xmath26 ? note that if there are @xmath13 cooperators in state @xmath22 , then @xmath27 , so this condition is equivalent to @xmath28 for small @xmath26 .    to answer this question",
    ", we first need to introduce some notation .",
    "if @xmath29 is a vertex of the graph and @xmath22 is a configuration , then let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be the frequencies of cooperators and defectors , respectively , among the neighbors of the player at vertex @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , let @xmath32 be the fraction of paths of length two , starting at @xmath29 , that consist of a cooperator followed by a defector . from these quantities , let    [ eq : localfrequencies ] @xmath33    which are obtained by averaging these ` local frequencies ' over all of the players in the population . from these local frequencies , which are straightforward to calculate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : localfrequencies ] ) , we obtain our main result : for small @xmath26 , @xmath25 if and only if the benefit - to - cost ratio exceeds the critical value    @xmath34    whenever the denominator is positive ( and @xmath35 otherwise ) .",
    "since the calculations of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are @xmath39 and the calculation of @xmath40 is @xmath21 , it follows that the complexity of finding the critical benefit - to - cost ratio is @xmath21 , so it is feasible to calculate even when the population is large .",
    "note also that if @xmath41 is the state obtained by swapping cooperators and defectors in @xmath22 , then both @xmath22 and @xmath41 have the same critical benefit - to - cost ratio .",

    "one is a defector ( @xmath42 ) ; thus , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , of the nine paths of length two that begin at vertex @xmath29 , only two ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) consist of a cooperator followed by a defector , and it follows that @xmath49.[fig : localfrequencies ] ]    when @xmath22 has just a single cooperator , the ratio of eq .",
    "( [ eq : generalpayoffmatrix ] ) reduces to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiorandom ] ) , which , in particular , does not depend on the location of the cooperator .",
    "this property is notable because the fixation probability itself usually does depend on the location of the cooperator , even on regular graphs @xcite .",
    "we show in methods that one recovers from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiogeneral ] ) the result of @xcite that eq .",

    "( [ eq : ratiogeneral ] ) converges uniformly to @xmath6 as @xmath51 ( see methods ) . therefore , on sufficiently large graphs , the critical ratio is approximated by @xmath6 for any configuration , regardless of the number of cooperators . as a result ,",
    "on large graphs there is less of a distinction between the various transient ( non - monomorphic ) states in terms of whether or not selection favors the fixation of cooperators . on smaller graphs",
    ", these transient states can behave quite differently from one another .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced on very small social networks in which cooperators can be strategically planted in the population to ensure that cooperators are favored by selection .      among the more interesting consequences of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiogeneral ] ) are its implications for the success of cooperators as a function of the initial configuration .",
    "recall that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiorandom ] ) gives the critical benefit - to - cost ratio for both ( i ) configurations with a single cooperator and ( ii ) random configurations with a fixed number of cooperators .",
    "when cooperators and defectors are configured randomly , this critical ratio is independent of the number of cooperators , which suggests that the effects of selection can not be improved by increasing the initial abundance of cooperators .",
    "( [ eq : ratiogeneral ] ) , on the other hand , shows that the initial configuration of cooperators , including their abundance , does affect how selection acts on the population .",
    "first of all , there are graphs for which the critical benefit - to - cost ratio is infinite for configurations with a single cooperator but finite for some configurations with multiple cooperators ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : promotesuppress](a ) ) .",
    "in contrast , there are graphs for which this ratio is finite for configurations with a single cooperator but infinite for some states with multiple cooperators ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : promotesuppress](b ) ) .",
    "therefore , despite the fact that the critical ratio for a single mutant is the same as the critical ratio for a random configuration with any fixed number of mutants , the critical ratio does ( in general ) depend on the number of mutants present in the configuration .     and , in particular , finite .",
    "however , the fixation of cooperation can not be favored for any initial configuration with a single cooperator on this graph .",
    "( b ) cooperation can not be favored for the initial condition that is shown since the critical benefit - to - cost ratio is infinite .",

    "if selection increases this fixation probability when starting from state ( i ) , then it does so when starting from any other mixed initial configuration.[fig : fruchtminmax ] ]    the strategic placement of cooperators and defectors can therefore produce a critical benefit - to - cost ratio that is less than the ratio for a single cooperator among defectors .",
    "in fact , starting from a configuration with just one cooperator , one can reduce this critical ratio by placing a second cooperator adjacent to the first cooperator ( see methods ) . if @xmath5 lies below eq .",
