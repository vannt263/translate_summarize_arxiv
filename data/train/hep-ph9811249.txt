    "the decay amplitudes , dominated by the color - allowed external @xmath28-emission , are proportional to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a charged current  charged current 4-quark operator . for class - ii decays , the decay amplitudes , governed by the color - suppressed internal @xmath28-emission , are described by @xmath31 with @xmath32 being a neutral current ",

    "the decay amplitudes of the class - iii decays involve a linear combination of @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "if factorization works , the effective coefficients @xmath27 in nonleptonic @xmath25 or @xmath26 decays should be channel by channel independent . since the factorized hadronic matrix elements @xmath34 are renormalization scheme and scale independent , so are @xmath27 .",
    "what is the relation between the effective coefficients @xmath27 and the wilson coefficients in the effective hamiltonian approach ? under the naive factorization hypothesis , one has a_1()=c_1()+1n_cc_2 ( ) , a_2()=c_2()+1n_cc_1 ( ) , for decay amplitudes induced by current - current operators @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "however , this naive factorization approach encounters two principal difficulties : ( i ) the above coefficients @xmath37 are scale dependent , and ( ii ) it fails to describe the color - suppressed class - ii decay modes . for example",
    ", the predicted decay rate of @xmath38 by naive factorization is too small compared to experiment .",
    "two different approaches have been advocated in the past for solving the aforementioned scale problem associated with the naive factorization approximation . in the first approach ,",
    "one incorporates nonfactorizable effects into the effective coefficients @xcite : @xmath39 where nonfactorizable terms are characterized by the parameters @xmath40 .",

    "the @xmath47 dependence of the wilson coefficients is assumed to be exactly compensated by that of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "that is , the correct @xmath47 dependence of the matrix elements is restored by @xmath48 . in the second approach , it is postulated that the hadronic matrix element @xmath49 is related to the tree - level one via the relation @xmath50 and that @xmath51 is independent of the external hadron states .",

    "it is thus desirable to have an objective estimation of @xmath71 .",
    "a model - independent extraction of @xmath3 is possible because the decay modes @xmath6 can be related by factorization to the measured semileptonic decays @xmath7 .",
    "as a consequence , the ratio of nonleptonic to differential semileptonic decay rates measured at @xmath72 is independent of above - mentioned uncertainties . the determination of @xmath65 from @xmath2 is sensitive to the form factors @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 at @xmath15 . in order to accommodate the observed production ratio @xmath73 by generalized factorization ,",

    "this is understandable because the branching ratio of @xmath24 in the absence of fsi is much smaller than that of @xmath334 .",
    "therefore , even a small amount of fsi via the @xmath337 intermediate state will enhance the decay rate of @xmath338 significantly .",
    "2 displays the change of the upper limit of @xmath4 in the nrsx model with respect to the phase shift difference , where we have set @xmath331 . evidently , the bound on @xmath4 becomes more stringent as @xmath335 increases ; we find @xmath339 in the absence of fsi and @xmath340 at @xmath341 ( see table xi for other model predictions ) .",
    "although the magnitude of @xmath4 extracted from @xmath2 has small errors compared to that determined from the interference effect in @xmath343 , its sign remains unknown . since @xmath344 is positive in the usual sign convention for @xmath3 , it is natural to assign the same sign to the @xmath83 channel .",
    "it has been long advocated in @xcite that the sign of @xmath345 predicted by the sum rule analysis is opposite to the above expectation .",
    "however , we believe that a negative sign for @xmath345 is very unlikely for three main reasons : ( i ) taking @xmath346 as a representative value and using @xmath347 , @xmath348 from eq .",
    "( [ ceff ] ) , we obtain two possible solutions for the nonfactorizable term @xmath349 [ see eq .",
    "( [ aeff ] ) ] : @xmath350 and @xmath351 .",
    "recall that @xmath352 is positive and of order 0.15 @xcite .",
    "though the energy release in @xmath261 is somewhat smaller than that in the @xmath247 mode , it still seems very unlikely that @xmath285 will change the magnitude and in particular the sign suddenly from the @xmath247 channel to the @xmath16 one . to make our point more transparent",
    ", we note that @xmath285 has the expression : _",
    "2(bj / k)=_8^(bk , j/)+a_2c_1_1^(bk , j/ ) , where the parameters @xmath353 and @xmath354 are defined in eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) . since @xmath355 ,",
    "it is evident that @xmath285 is dominated by the parameter @xmath353 originated from color octet - octet currents ; that is , the nonfactorized term @xmath285 is governed by soft gluon interactions .",
    "limit , @xmath354 is suppressed relative to @xmath353 by a factor of @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "numerically , @xmath356 and @xmath357 at @xmath358 gev are found in @xcite by extracting them from the data .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath359 is not necessarily smaller than @xmath360 , but this will not affect the conclusion that @xmath285 is dominated by the @xmath353 term . ] therefore , @xmath361 should become smaller when the energy released to the final - state particles becomes larger , for example , @xmath362 . it is natural to expect that @xmath363 , the solution @xmath364 is thus not favored by the above physical argument .",
    "( ii ) relying on a different approach , namely , the three - scale pqcd factorization theorem , the authors of @xcite are able to explain the sign change of @xmath285 from @xmath183 to @xmath184 , though the application of pqcd to the latter is only marginal . the same approach predicts a positive @xmath4 for @xmath2 , as expected @xcite .",
    "( iii ) the existing sum rule analysis does confirm the cancellation between the @xmath365 fierz term and @xmath285 for the charmed decay @xmath182 @xcite , but it also shows that the cancellation persists even in hadronic two - body decays of @xmath25 mesons @xcite .",
    "for example , the light - cone qcd sum rule calculation of nonfactorizable effects in @xmath24 in @xcite yields a negative @xmath285 and @xmath4 , which is in contradiction with experiment .",
    "this means that care must be taken when applying the sum rule analysis to the @xmath25 decays .",
    "indeed , there exist some loopholes in the conventional sum rule description of nonleptonic two - body decays ( see also the comment made in @xcite ) , a challenging issue we are now in progress for investigation .      since @xmath367 , the effective coefficient @xmath4 is sensitive to the nonfactorizable effects , and hence it is more suitable than @xmath3 for extracting @xmath366 [ strictly speaking , @xmath368 the effective number of colors defined in eq .",

    "using the recent experimental data of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and various model calculations on form factors , we have re - analyzed the effective coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 and their ratio .",
    "our results are :    * the extraction of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the processes @xmath373 and @xmath83 is contaminated by qcd and electroweak penguin contributions .",
    "we found that the penguin correction to the decay amplitude is sizable for @xmath374 , but only at the 4% level for @xmath375 .",
    "* the model - dependent extraction of @xmath3 from @xmath204 is more reliable than that from @xmath5 as the latter involve uncertainties from penguin corrections , unknown decay constants @xmath197 , @xmath198 and the poor precision of the measured branching ratios . * in addition to the model - dependent determination , @xmath3 has also been extracted in a model - independent way based on the observation that the decays @xmath6 can be related by factorization to the measured semileptonic differential distribution of @xmath7 at @xmath8 .",
    "the model - independent results @xmath376 and @xmath377 should be reliable and trustworthy .",

    "* armed with the model - independent results for @xmath3 , we have extracted heavy - to - heavy form factors from @xmath378 : @xmath379 and @xmath10 , where the first error is due to the measured branching ratios and the second one due to quark - mixing matrix elements .",
