    "the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ; ) is an empirical scaling between the luminosity of a disk galaxy and its rotation velocity .",
    "later work replaced luminosity with the more physical quantity stellar mass , m@xmath4 . in the local universe ,",
    "the tfr is remarkably tight @xcite and its parameterization serves as an important constraint for models of disk galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the tfr is well behaved for ordered disk galaxies , morphologically disturbed or compact galaxies tend to fall below the local relation , exhibiting low rotation velocity for a given stellar mass @xcite .",
    "ordered velocity fields may be disturbed in major merging events or tidal disruptions , through the accretion of non - ordered external angular momentum from cold flows @xcite and/or disruptive feedback @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that accounting for both the disordered motions ( @xmath1 ) and ordered rotation velocity ( v@xmath2 ) in a new kinematic quantity , @xmath7 , re - establishes a tighter @xmath8-m@xmath4 scaling relation .",
    "this relation is independent of galaxy morphology and coincident with the faber - jackson relation for early type galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that s@xmath9 traces the overall potential well of galaxy - dark halo systems , even for galaxies undergoing drastic kinematic events , such as a major merger @xcite .",
    "the measurement of a disordered velocity component has been incorporated more in recent years ( e.g. ) .    with further investigation , @xcite demonstrated that since z @xmath10 1 star - forming galaxies have been kinematically settling from systems with a dominant dispersion component to rotationally supported disks .",
    "such galaxies follow kinematic downsizing : more massive galaxies exhibit the most ordered kinematics ( high v@xmath2/@xmath1 ) at all epochs . while high and intermediate mass galaxies are likely settling to disks ,",
    "it is unclear whether low mass galaxies follow the same evolutionary path .",
    "it is well known locally that morphological type is a strong function of stellar mass , with dwarf systems exhibiting more irregular morphology , distinct from their large disk counterparts ( e.g. ) .",
    "moreover , there is mounting evidence that disturbed galaxies are increasingly more common at low masses in the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , kinematic surveys often select against galaxies with disturbed morphologies with regards to other interests , e.g. performing distance measurements or studying dark matter ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the local universe",
    ", dwarf galaxies can show rotational signatures in both their hi and stellar components ( e.g. ) . when the morphological selection is opened to include irregular galaxies , compact galaxies , and close pairs , the presence of features such as peculiar velocity fields and thick disks",
    "are found .",
    "indeed , complex kinematics and low rotational support is frequently found for both low luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) and highly star - forming dwarfs ( e.g. ) .",
    "however , locally , limited studies have been performed placing large samples of these disordered systems on the tfr , or relating the relative contributions of v and @xmath11 to the morphology of the galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we study the resolved kinematics for a morphologically unbiased sample of star - forming galaxies at z @xmath10 0.2 .",
    "compared to nearby samples , a survey at z @xmath10 0.2 benefits from the smaller angular sizes of galaxies and the higher target density .",
    "large homogenous samples can be efficiently obtained with a multi - object spectrograph .",
    "this sample is unique from other local samples in that we include galaxies with both disturbed and disk - like morphologies .",
    "furthermore , we incorporate measurements of the non - negligible contributions from random motions as well as the rotation velocity .    in section 2 , we discuss the sample selection , the method used for measuring kinematics from emission lines and the measurements of quantitative morphologies . in section 3 , we present the main result of this paper : a transition stellar mass in the tfr . in section 4",
    ", we illustrate the correlation between gas phase kinematics and galaxy morphology . in section 5",
    ", we compare our results with measurements of kinematics for low mass galaxies in the literature both locally and at intermediate redshift .",

    "in this section we detail the sample selection and the measurements of the kinematics and morphological indices .",
    "we reference the appendix for further analysis and discussion of the effects of seeing on our kinematic measurements .",
    "we focus on the lowest redshift bin in the galaxy sample used by @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter referred to as k07 and k12 , respectively ) , namely 0.1 @xmath0 z @xmath0 0.375 . at these redshifts ,",
    "the k12 sample is sensitive to low mass dwarf galaxies .",
    "we briefly review how this sample was selected and defer to k12 for further details .",
    "the k12 sample is drawn from field 1 of the deep2 redshift survey @xcite .",
    "deep2 employed the deimos multi - object spectrograph @xcite on the keck - ii telescope .",
    "the 1200 line / mm grating was used and the slits were fixed at 1@xmath15 , leading to a spectral resolution of r @xmath10 5000 . the k12 sample was cut on nebular line strength ( @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 cm @xmath18 ) , available hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging and slit alignment from the photometric major axis ( @xmath19 40@xmath20 ) .",
    "we use hst imaging in two passbands with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , v ( f606w ) and i ( f814w ) , from the aegis survey @xcite .",
    "each of the images has a pixel scale of 0.03@xmath15 and a typical fwhm psf of 0.1@xmath15 ( 0.33 kpc at z = 0.2 ) .",
    "inclinations are measured with the sextractor software using the v - band hst image .",
    "the v - band traces the young stars and thus should not be very different from the nebular emission line morphology .",
    "a further cut is applied to the sample , limiting inclinations to 30@xmath21 i @xmath22 , to avoid uncertain inclination corrections for face - on galaxies and dust effects in edge on systems .",
    "however , a handful ( 4 ) of severely disturbed galaxies for which inclinations and pas are uncertain are included .",
    "the exclusion of these galaxies does not alter our conclusions .",
    "stellar masses were derived using the rest frame b - v color and absolute b - band magnitude @xcite with refined empirical corrections from sed fitting @xcite , as described in @xcite .",
    "the adopted imf is from @xcite .",
    "errors on stellar masses are approximately 0.2 dex .",
    "spectral slits must be aligned to within 40@xmath23 of a galaxy s major axis to reliably recover rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "k07 removed galaxies with slits misaligned by more than 40@xmath23 from the hst derived photometric major axis , except for the 4 galaxies with severely disturbed morphologies . beyond this cut",
    "there are no residual correlations between measured kinematics ( rotation or dispersion ) and slit alignment in our sample .",
    "the scale of the atmospheric turbulence sets a limiting angular size for measuring rotation velocity in a galaxy .",
    "the seeing tends to smooth and eliminate small scale rotation gradients .",
    "we test the limiting resolving power imposed by beam smearing in the appendix . for the observational conditions of deep2 and for the lowest s",
    "/ n in our sample , kinematics can be measured for galaxies to diameters encompassing 95@xmath24 of the light ( d@xmath25 ) of ( 0.87@xmath260.06 ) @xmath27 seeing .",
    "we make a further cut on the k07 sample and remove 12 galaxies which are not extended enough to confidently measure kinematics .",
    "our final sample contains 119 galaxies and uniformly covers the  blue cloud \" ( figure 1 in k12 ) .",
    "the qualifying feature of our selection is that , aside from the inclination cut , there was no explicit selection on morphology .",
    "contrary to previous tfr studies , this sample selection includes disturbed and compact galaxies .",
    "this allows us to more fully sample the population of emission line galaxies .",
    "we adopt kinematics measured from bright nebular emission lines ( h@xmath28 @xmath296563 or [ oiii ] @xmath295007 ) in k07 .",
    "the rotation velocity , uncorrected for inclination , and spatially resolved gas dispersion , @xmath1 , were measured with the program rotcurve @xcite , taking into account the effects of seeing .",
    "the seeing was measured through alignment stars on each slit mask ( see @xcite ) . for our sample ,",
    "the seeing varied between 0.55@xmath15 and 1.2@xmath15 fwhm , with a median value of 0.75@xmath15 ( 1.36 kpc at z = 0.1 , 3.84 kpc at z = 0.375 ) .",
    "the kinematic measurements have been described in previous papers , so we will briefly review them here and refer to @xcite for the details . in short , rotcurve builds model arctan rotation curves where v is the velocity on the flat part of the rotation curve ( v@xmath2 @xmath27 @xmath30 ) , with an additional dispersion term ( @xmath1 ) , which is constant with radius . due to the seeing , the rise of the rotation curve is not well resolved and the turnover radius for the rotation curve ( r@xmath31 ) is not well constrained .",
    "the turnover radius is kept fixed to a value of 0.2@xmath15 .",
    "the recovered rotation velocity and turnover radius are only slightly covariant , with a marginal @xmath26 0.1 dex change in v for a @xmath260.1@xmath15 change in r@xmath31 .",
    "models with varying v and @xmath1 are blurred with the seeing and fit to the data .",
    "v and @xmath1 are explored with a grid spacing of 5 km s@xmath17 and the best fit value is determined through a @xmath32 minimization on this grid .",
    "the spectral resolution of the 1200 line / mm grating used by the deep2 survey allows measurements for v@xmath2 @xmath27 @xmath30 down to @xmath10 5 kms@xmath17 and @xmath1 to @xmath10 15 kms@xmath17 .",
    "measurements with best fits below these limitations are set to these values as upper limits .",
    "this is the case for 7 galaxies for v@xmath2 and 22 galaxies for @xmath1 .",
    "example kinematic fits and the corresponding @xmath32 spaces are shown later in this paper in figure [ fig : indmorph ] .",
    "hst imaging is used to measure inclinations in order to correct the measured rotation velocity . as mentioned previously ,",
    "corrections were not applied to four galaxies with severely disturbed morphologies where the inclination was highly uncertain .",
    "they are marked with carets in figure [ fig : kinematics ] .",
    "we note that the quantity @xmath1 is _ not _ like the typical pressure supported velocity dispersion measured from stellar absorption lines in early - type galaxies . since @xmath1 is tracing hot gas which can radiate , a high dispersion system can not remain in equilibrium after a crossing time .",
    "therefore @xmath1 is effectively measuring velocity gradients below the seeing limit , as illustrated by the simulations of @xcite .",
    "the typical thermal broadening for t @xmath10 10@xmath33 k hydrogen gas is 10 kms@xmath17 , so a measure of @xmath1 @xmath34 25 kms@xmath17 is tracing the relative motions of hii regions and/or disordered motions associated with unresolved velocity gradients ( @xcite , k12 ) .",
    "high resolution hst - acs images allow us to quantify morphologies for each galaxy .",
    "in particular , we examine three indices : the gini coefficient , asymmetry , and concentration .",
    "we find little difference between the indices for the v- and i - band and so we simply adopt the i - band measurements ( approximately rest v - band at z=0.2 ) for our analysis .",
    "we describe these parameters now and examine how they correlate with kinematics in section 4 .",
    "the gini coefficient was adopted from economic theory . as applied to the study of galaxy morphology",
    ", the gini coefficient provides a non - parametric measurement of the distribution of light among the pixels associated with a galaxy @xcite .",
    "the gini coefficient approaches unity for systems with a large fraction of intensity confined to only a few pixels and approaches zero for a uniform intensity distribution .",
    "it compliments the more standard concentration index @xcite , as both trace intensity clustering , but the gini coefficient is insensitive to the location of the clustering .",
    "the typical uncertainty on the gini coefficient is 0.02 , as determined from empirical comparisons of deep ( udf ) and shallow fields ( goods ) @xcite .",
    "the concentration index ( defined in e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) measures the ratio of flux contained in two isophotes .",
    "the outer isophote is defined by the 2@xmath11 background contour with a normalized radius of 1 and the inner isophote is defined by a normalized radii of @xmath28 .",
    "concentration , asymmetry , and size were measured with the gim2d software @xcite , which simultaneously fit to both the v- and i - band images .",
    "the concentration index is measured for @xmath35 .",
    "we find no significant differences in trends between alpha levels and adopt @xmath36 for our analysis .",
    "the asymmetry index in gim2d is as defined in @xcite .",
    "asymmetry is measured by first assigning contiguous pixels to the galaxy , rotating the image by 180@xmath20 and then self - subtracting the mirrored image from the original image .",
    "the error bars we use in the figures below for asymmetry and concentration represent the typical 1@xmath11 scatter between the four gim2d measurements for each individual v - band image .",
    "these do not represent the additional uncertainty from the image s / n ( limiting magnitude @xmath10 28.7 ab ) , for which comparisons with deeper fields are needed .",
    "shallower studies than ours ( limiting magnitude @xmath10 26.5 ab ; e.g. @xcite ) find relative uncertainties in concentration and asymmetry of @xmath10 0.05 with respect to deeper data ( limiting magnitude @xmath10 27.4 ab ) .     z @xmath0 0.375 is shown . below a stellar mass of @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath37 9.5 ,",

    "the origin of the compactness and late stage star - formation in the low mass ( @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath5 @xmath10 7.0 - 9.6 ; @xcite ) bcds is up for debate .",
    "recent hi investigations suggest high fractions of kinematically disturbed disks ( @xmath10 50% ) , although only a handful of systems fall short of the baryonic tully - fisher relation . the ionized velocity fields are often found to exhibit high or dominant contributions from dispersion as well ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the largest surveys of resolved ionized gas kinematics in local galaxies is the ghasp survey ( gassendi h@xmath28 survey of spirals ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ghasp survey selection was focused on galaxies with both spiral and irregular morphologies , although most of the more luminous galaxies display characteristic disk morphologies .",
    "the ghasp survey samples a wide range in stellar mass 9.0 @xmath0 @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath5 @xmath0 11.7 @xcite .",
    "the tfr for a subset of galaxies is found to be relatively tight down to m@xmath44 = -18 or @xmath3 m@xmath4= 8.0 m@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "while galaxies with large non - circular motions and corresponding rotation curve asymmetries show the largest scatter from the tf relation , to both low v@xmath2 and low luminosity , the scatter is small compared to the dispersion dominated systems in our sample . aside from a few outliers , no large break to low rotation velocity was found in the tfr for the ghasp sample .",
    "this may be due to a combination of both small sample sizes at masses @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath5 @xmath0 9.5 ( 9 galaxies ) and/or selection functions for rotating galaxies playing a role in constructing the stellar mass tfr .",
    "the @xmath11/v for these 9 low mass galaxies ranges between 0.1 - 0.7 ( i.e. all would be kinematically ordered in this paper ) . on visual inspection of their optical morphologies in ned",
    ", we note that seven of these galaxies appear to have disk morphologies , with the presence of spiral arms in most cases .",
    "the low @xmath11/v in these galaxies is consistent with the picture presented in this paper , that disk morphologies indicate ordered kinematics .",
    "two of the galaxies ( ugc 5721 , ugc 10757 ) do appear to have disturbed morphologies , so it is interesting to note that their @xmath11/v is still less than 1 ( 0.16 and 0.35 , respectively ) .",
    "the mean velocity dispersion for the ghasp sample is 25 @xmath26 5 km s@xmath17 , typical of local disks in general .",
    "this level of dispersion is expected for a combination of the thermal broadening from h atoms ( t@xmath1010@xmath33 k ; @xmath10 10 kms@xmath17 ) and internal turbulence of hii regions ( @xmath10 20 kms@xmath17 ; ) .",
    "these measurements are comparable to the mean velocity dispersions for our ordered disks ( 21.0 @xmath26 8.1 kms@xmath17 ) and slightly lower than our systems with more disturbed kinematics ( 34 @xmath26 7.3 kms@xmath17 ) .",
    "for the few compact rotators in ghasp we ran mock tests ( see appendix a for an example with galaxy ugc 528 ) to ensure that we could accurately recover their rotation if they were in our sample at z @xmath10 0.2 .",
    "the results of these tests indicate that if these galaxies were included in our sample we would recover their rotating disks .",
    "our understanding of the ionized kinematics of dwarf galaxies at low redshifts will substantially increase in the near future with ongoing and upcoming integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) surveys .",
    "the califa ( 0.005 @xmath0 z @xmath0 0.03 , r @xmath10 850 - 1650 ; n @xmath10 600 ) , sami ( z @xmath0 0.12 , r @xmath10 1700 - 4500 ; n @xmath10 3400 ) and manga ( z @xmath10 0.03 ; r @xmath10 2000 ; n @xmath10 10,000 ) surveys will provide velocity fields for large ensembles of local low mass galaxies .",
    "first results from califa have reported that about half of the galaxies in their sample ( 8.5 @xmath0 @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath5 @xmath0 11.5 ) have structure in their velocity fields which departs from a rotating disk .",
    "however , resolved velocity dispersions were not measured in this study and the relatively coarse spectral resolution ( r @xmath10 1200 ) may not allow for measurements of the dispersion at the differences outlined in this paper .",
    "first results from sami show a large fraction of both low and high mass local galaxies falling to low v@xmath2 from the tfr @xcite .",
    "the sami survey improves upon the ghasp sample with a large coverage of low mass systems , pushing down to stellar masses @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath5 @xmath10 8 . below a stellar mass @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath37",
    "9 , they find a precipitous trailing of galaxies from the well - defined 1 r@xmath63 tf relation @xcite .",
    "high spectral resolution in the red band ( 6300 - 7400 @xmath64 , r @xmath10 4500 ) allow measurements of velocity dispersions . a tight scaling relation ( m@xmath4-s@xmath65 )",
    "is established once they account for the average measured velocity dispersion , similar to previous findings at high redshift .",
    "the sdss - iii manga survey will provide extensive additional coverage of this low mass regime , with a flat selection distribution down to a stellar mass of 10@xmath66 m@xmath5 and sampling out to at least 1.5 times the effective radius ( r@xmath63 ) @xcite .    in summary , when studied in large numbers , local studies of the tfr",
    "have been biased towards massive disk galaxies and moreover will often not have the spectral resolution to resolve velocity dispersion .",
    "when resolved gas phase kinematics are available in low mass galaxies , complex velocity fields are often found in both neutral and ionized gas . the local tfr for dwarf galaxies will be expanded upon in the upcoming years , with surveys probing kinematics in ionized gas to low stellar masses in unprecedented numbers .",
    "early results indicate an increase in complexity in the resolved 2d velocity fields of these low mass galaxies .",
    "due primarily to sensitivity limits , there have been few studies of the kinematics in more distant ( z @xmath34 0.1 ) dwarf galaxies .",
    "furthermore , most studies do not measure resolved velocity dispersions and do not include irregular or compact galaxies .",
    "using deep 8 hour deimos exposures , @xcite constructed the stellar mass tfr for half of their sample ( n = 41 ) of dwarf galaxies ( 7 @xmath67 m@xmath45m@xmath68 9 ) out to z = 1 , demonstrating that at least a fraction of dwarf galaxies are settled into rotationally supported systems at intermediate redshift .",
    "the remaining galaxies were either missing emission or were too small to reliably resolve rotation .",
    "recently , interest in dispersion dominated galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) has motivated searches for high dispersion low redshift analogs .",
    "these studies typically select highly star - forming systems and find complex kinematics with low v/@xmath1 compared to local disk galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "compact lyman break analogues ( lba ) are an example of such a selection .",
    "lbas are highly star - forming galaxies at z @xmath10 0.2 , selected from their high galex nuv luminosity @xcite . although these systems have slightly higher stellar masses 9.5 @xmath19 m@xmath4/m@xmath5 @xmath19 10.7 than the break in our sample , they exhibit morphologies and kinematics which are similar to some of our more compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite report on ao - assisted ifs observations of 19 compact lbas at z @xmath10 0.2 with stellar masses near our transition mass , 9.1 @xmath0 @xmath3 m@xmath4/m@xmath5 @xmath0 10.7 .",
    "they find a very high contribution of disordered motion in these rare systems ( @xmath1 @xmath10 70 km s@xmath17 ) and evidence that disk - like structure is more common in high mass lbas .",
    "similarly , @xcite measured h@xmath28 kinematics for 67 extremely star - forming systems down to a stellar mass of @xmath69 m@xmath5 and found that one fifth of their sample shows no signs of rotation .",
    "the rotating disk galaxies in their sample fall on the tfr while still exhibiting values of v/@xmath1 lower than local disks , comparable to dynamically hot high redshift galaxies .",
    "the dispersion dominated galaxies v/@xmath1 @xmath19 1 in both the intermediate redshift ifs samples have typical stellar masses above our observed mass of disk formation ( @xmath3 m@xmath6/m@xmath5 @xmath10 9.5 ) .",
    "although the unique selections ( e.g. high star - formation , high surface mass density ) for these samples are not necessarily representative , they do demonstrate the important contribution of @xmath1 to the kinematics in active systems .    at high redshifts ( 1.5 @xmath0 z @xmath0 3 ) ,",
    "complex velocity fields and thick disks with high velocity dispersions are ubiquitous in the samples currently available in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a stellar mass dependence on the relative contributions of @xmath1 and v@xmath2 appears to exist , although beam smearing ( see appendix ) may provide the enhanced dispersion in some of the the smallest systems @xcite .",
    "kinematic data for low mass galaxies at these redshifts is currently limited .",
    "the advent of high sensitivity near - ir instruments ( e.g. mosfire , kmos ) will soon provide large samples of kinematics for galaxies with low stellar masses .",
    "we study the stellar mass tully - fisher relation ( tfr ; stellar mass versus rotation velocity ) for a morphologically blind sample of emission line galaxies in the field .",
    "the galaxies are at a redshift of @xmath70 , or a lookback time of about 2 gyrs , and therefore we expect little evolution from the local tfr .",
    "we report on a transition mass in the tfr which we call the  mass of disk formation , \" m@xmath6 .",
    "this mass separates galaxies which always form disks ( masses greater than m@xmath6 ) from those which may or may not form disks ( masses less than m@xmath6 ) . for m@xmath71 , all galaxies in our sample are settled onto the local tfr .",
    "however , for m@xmath72 , galaxies can either lie on the tfr or scatter off of it to low rotation velocity .",
    "the galaxies which scatter off have higher disordered motions , as measured through integrated gas velocity dispersions ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , we find that galaxies on the tfr are morphologically distinct from those which scatter off",
    ". the quantitative morphologies of galaxies on the relation are on average less asymmetric and concentrated than those galaxies which scatter off .",
    "we perform mock observations of the 3d kinematics of local galaxies to investigate how well we are able to recover the rotation velocity of the smallest galaxies in our sample .",
    "these simulations show that we are able to recover rotation , if present , in the smallest galaxies in our sample .",

    "reliably measuring resolved kinematics for a galaxy depends critically on its apparent size relative to the seeing , i.e. beam smearing ( @xcite ) .",
    "atmospheric turbulence blurs together intrinsically spatially separate velocity gradients , leading to a smoothing of the rotation field and a boosted central velocity dispersion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "rotcurve models the seeing and recovers rotation curves and average integrated gas velocity dispersions for galaxies with apparent sizes larger than the seeing ( see examples in @xcite ) . overcoming beam smearing with galaxies",
    "whose intrinsic size is comparable to the seeing is challenging and has been addressed by several papers with respect to ifs measurements at high redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) .    to understand the effects of beam smearing on our measurements we perform mock observations of observed velocity and dispersion maps for a nearby galaxy from the literature .",
    "in particular , we use fabry - perot observations of ugc 528 from the ghasp survey @xcite .",
    "we determine the apparent galaxy size ( defined as the extent of the line emission ) at which the intrinsic rotation velocity is no longer recovered under the observing conditions and instrumental set - up used by the deep2 survey .",
    "ugc 528 is a small rotating local spiral galaxy of hubble type sab(rs)b .",
    "it has a rotation velocity v@xmath73(i ) @xmath10 60 kms@xmath17 and a relatively high average dispersion across its face of @xmath1 = 26.0 @xmath26 9.6 kms@xmath17 .",
    "we build mock spectral cubes ( 3d : spatial @xmath27 spatial @xmath27 @xmath29 ) from the available velocity , dispersion and flux maps .",
    "this allows us to perform mock observations for an arbitrary velocity sampling without needing to interpolate between slices . to do this , we first construct an empty cube with velocity sampling matching deep2 , namely @xmath74v = 12.6 kms@xmath17 at z = 0.2",
    "next , using the flux , velocity and dispersion maps we fill the cube with model h@xmath28 emission . for each spaxel in the map with valid velocity information",
    "we create a gaussian line profile with a mean line of sight velocity v@xmath75 , dispersion @xmath1 and amplitude scaled to match the integrated flux .",
    "this cube is then projected from its original redshift to z = 0.2 by resizing the spaxel scale .",
    "each slice in the cube is then convolved with a 2d spatial gaussian kernel ( fwhm = 0.75@xmath15 ) to simulate seeing .",
    "a mock 1@xmath15 wide slit is placed along the kinematic pa of the galaxy . from this",
    "we produce a mock spectrum using the deep2 pixel scales ( 0.118 @xmath15/pixel , 0.33 @xmath64/pixel ) and spectral resolution ( r @xmath10 5000 ) .",
    "noise is added to the 2d spectrum to match the typical pixel to pixel s / n profiles of our faintest sources .",
    "we create separate cubes in this manner , each time varying the spatial size to simulate different apparent sizes for ugc 528 .",
    "the final product is a set of 100 mock observations of ugc 528 at z = 0.2 ranging in size 0.4 -2.2@xmath15 with a 0.018@xmath15 step size .",
    "each mock observation results in a 2d spectrum of the emission line for a given apparent size .",
    "next we run each of the mock spectra through rotcurve to measure kinematics .",
    "we fix the scale radius of ugc 528 in physical units to its true value of 0.6 kpc @xcite . for reasonable values , we find that the chosen scale radius has little impact on the kinematic measurements , as was also found by @xcite .",
    "we measure v@xmath2 @xmath27 @xmath76 and @xmath1 for each of the 100 mock spectra .",
    "the results of our test are demonstrated in figure [ fig : ugc528 ] . as expected , at large intrinsic sizes relative to the seeing ( d@xmath25 @xmath34 1.5 @xmath27 seeing ) we are able to recover the intrinsic rotation and integrated dispersion well .",
    "as the mock observations reach closer to and beyond the scale of the seeing , we note that the measured rotation velocity decreases and the measured dispersion increases as expected . to quantify the scale at which this turnover occurs",
    ", we fit a simple change point model using pymc @xcite . the turnover to artificially low v@xmath2 occurs at a scale of d@xmath25/seeing = 0.87 @xmath26 0.06 .",
    "this error incorporates both the measurement error imposed by the slit ( red shading in figure [ fig : ugc528 ] , left ) and the error in the fit to the model .",
    "we now compare the intrinsic sizes of the galaxies in our sample to the size of the seeing . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : ugc528 ] we plot the size of the galaxy in emission , tracing areas of star - formation , against the size in continuum , tracing the young stellar population .",
    "the hubble sizes are measured from the hst v - band images and the emission sizes are measured directly from the deimos spectra",
    ". the observed emission lines ( @xmath77 ) are broadened by the combined psf of the instrument and the seeing ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we can recover the true extent of the emission line ( @xmath79 ) :      for an approximate 1-d gaussian profile , the diameter containing 95@xmath24 of the flux will be 4 times this value . in reality ,",
    "intrinsic emission profiles of galaxies will be broader than a gaussian distribution and the value of @xmath79 is primarily determined by the profile of the core . a galaxy profile with broader wings than a gaussian will have a d@xmath25 that is larger than that given by 4 @xmath27 @xmath79 .",
    "the hst v - band ( rest b at z @xmath10 0.2 ) extent correlates well with the seeing - corrected emission line sizes ( figure [ fig : ugc528 ] , right ) .",
    "we demarcate the typical seeing size of 0.75@xmath15 .",
    "the smallest galaxies in our sample reach down to seeing - corrected emission extents of @xmath10 1.2@xmath15 ( or 1.6 times the typical seeing fwhm ) , well into the predicted regime for accurately recovering the kinematics ( figure [ fig : ugc528 ] ; left panel ) . in conclusion , it is unlikely that our low mass dispersion dominated galaxies are dispersion - dominated because of beam - smearing ."
