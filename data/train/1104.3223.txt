    "neutron star cooling is an important tool to probe its inner structure .",
    "the comparison of cooling models with observation of thermal emission provide insight into the eos of dense matter , and the signatures of exotic particles@xcite@xcite .",
    "a newly formed neutron star loses the thermal energy through neutrino emission initially , and is taken over by the surface photon radiation about @xmath0yr after birth .",
    "however , heating sources inside neutron stars can keep neutron stars hot beyond the standard cooling timescale @xmath1yr .",
    "some mechanisms have been extensively discussed .",
    "these include the mutual friction between superfluid and normal component of the star @xcite , heat released through deconfinement phase transition@xciteand release of strain energy stored by the solid crust due to spindown deformation @xcite .",
    "another of these mechanism is rotochemical heating , firstly proposed by reisenegger@xcite and applied to quark stars by cheng@xcite .",
    "then reisenegger improved it , in the framework of general relativity , by considering the internal structure via realistic eoss @xcite and superfluid nucleons core@xcite .",
    "all studies above agree that rotochemical heating is important for old neutron stars .",
    "rotochemical heating origins in the deviation from weak reaction equilibrium due to spin - down compression .",
    "as the star spins down , the decrease of the centrifugal force leads to compression , increasing the star s internal density .",
    "this compression results in a displacement of the equilibrium concentration of each particle species and changes the chemical equilibrium state .",
    "reactions that change the chemical composition drive the system to the new equilibrium configuration .",
    "if the reaction rate is slower than the change of the equilibrium concentrations due to spin - down compression , the star is never exactly in chemical equilibrium , so energy is stored .",
    "the excess of energy is dissipated by enhanced neutrino emission and heat generation .",
    "it has long been hypothesized that some compact stars might actually be `` hybrid stars '' containing cores of quark matter@xcite .",
    "unlike neutron stars with pure hadronic matter and strange stars with pure strange matter , those hybrid stars probably contain the mixed phase in light of glendenning s phase transition theory@xcite .",
    "of course , the compression of a hybrid star due to spin - down causes deconfinement phase transition ( hereafter ) , besides nonequilibium urca processes@xcite .",
    "the spin - down compression increases the interior density gradually , which results in the transformation of hadron matter into quark matter in the interior little by little .",
    "the deconfinement reactions change relative concentrations of the particles , neutrons , protons , and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 quarks , and result in the displacement of equilibrium state as well . because neutrons and protons are converted into two flavor quarks , and it takes a finite amount of time that two flavor quarks decay into three .",
    "thus the deconfinement contribution need to be considered in the calculation of the @xmath5-equilibrium state deviation .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the effect of dpt on rotochemical heating in mixed phase . in section 2 ,",
    "we attempt a model to describe the deviations from @xmath5-equilibrium state under the circumstance of dpt . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive the equations of chemical and thermal evolution , and discuss an application of a uniform star model with mixed phase matter .",
    "the results and corresponding explanations are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we give our conclusions and suggest future improvement .",
    ". in fact ,",
    "neutrons and protons are converted into @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks , without @xmath4 quarks .",
    "so the deconfinement reactions break the equilibrium state and drive the system deviating to a nonequilibrium state 2 , @xmath6 .",
    "weak reactions adjust the concentrations of these particles and try to recover the system to a new equilibrium state 3.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    hybrid stars have more complicated matter composition than purely neutron stars , which contains neutrons , protons , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 quarks and electrons .",
    "the relative concentrations of these particles are adjusted by the following weak reactions , @xmath7 at the same time , the compression leads to the deconfinement reactions , @xmath8 nucleons dissolve into only two flavor quarks , so the relative concentrations of three flavor quarks need to be adjusted by non - leptonic reaction , @xmath9 thus there are two channels , through which the @xmath5-equilibrium is violated .",
    "one is a direct contribution of spin - down compression discovered by reisenegger@xcite .",
    "another is the contribution of deconfinement reactions caused by the spin - down .",
    "the deconfinement reactions take place firstly and then result in a departure from @xmath5-equilibrium state .",
    "the deconfinement reactions lead to the change of quark baryon number density @xmath10 and change of nucleon baryon number density @xmath11 .",
    "since neutrons and protons are converted into @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks , without @xmath4 quarks , we have @xmath12 the reactions([eq : decomfinement ] ) change the concentration of particles and drive the system deviating from an equilibrium state ( state1 ) to a nonequilibrium state ( state 2 ) .",
    "then , the system tries to recover to a new equilibrium state ( state3 ) through reactions ( [ eq : durca])and ( [ eq : adjust reaction ] ) .",
    "we give a description of these processes in figure 1 .",
    "since the deconfinement reactions is faster than weak reactions , the system is never exactly in chemical equilibrium due to deconfinement behavior .    for quarks , the non - leptonic reaction ( [ eq : adjust reaction ] ) and durca reactions ( [ eq : durca ] )",
    "are all involved in the evolution of chemical potential , among which only two processes are needed in the calculation of the chemical departure , resulting in rotochemical heating . in the later calculation",
    ", we find that the contribution of the nucleon dominates hybrid star thermal evolution and the chemical evolution of nucleon is independent of reaction ( [ eq : adjust reaction ] ) .",
    "so we do nt distinguish the difference between the non - leptonic reaction and durca reactions , and choose the durca reactions to calculate the chemical potential difference .    to express the chemical deviation quantities , under consideration of deconfinement reactions ,",
    "we define the chemical potential of particle @xmath13 in nonequilibrium state ( state2)as @xmath14 and @xmath15 in new equilibrium state ( state 3 ) .",
    "the chemical potential differences of three channels in reactions([eq : durca ] ) are : @xmath16 where reaction channels denoted by capitals , particles denoted by small letters .",
    "we assume @xmath17,@xmath18 , under beta equilibrium , then @xmath19 , @xmath20 , this leads to the following equality , with constraint by reactions([eq : decomfinement ] ) , @xmath21 substitute ( [ eq : quark fraction ] ) into ( [ eq : density ] ) , we obtain @xmath22 at zero temperature , chemical potential of fermions satisfies @xmath23 , then we determine chemical potential of particles in each state for density change and density of a given initial state .",
    "+ state 1 : @xmath24 state 2 : @xmath25 state 3 : @xmath26 state 2 and 3 can be expressed in light of state 1 and density change , we immediately write @xmath27 since state 3 has been defined as equilibrium state , the @xmath5-equilibrium condition should enter to simplify our calculations .",

    "figure 3 gives the chemical potential departure of nucleon channel with magnetic field strengths @xmath62 and @xmath64 , to compare deconfinement and spin - down situations .",

    "besides the spin - down , an adjoint of dpt indeed causes the departure from @xmath5-equilibrium in mixed phase matter .",
    "this mechanism is investigated in this paper .",
    "the new mechanism makes a substantial promotion in effective surface temperature .",
    "we usually believe hybrid stars cool down rapidly following standard cooling theory .",
    "our results show that a hybrid star should has much higher temperature when the chemical heating with dpt is considered .",
    "although we consider a uniform density model to facilitate our understanding of the mechanism , the results are very close to the hybrid stars containing large mixed phase core if their mean density equals the assumed uniform density .    in our calculations",
    ", we set @xmath77 as a constant and only consider the contribution of the dpt in chemical deviation .",
    "the new mechanism makes a greater contribution than the spin - down one .",
    "so the direct contribution of spin - down compression is not important for rotochemical deviations in stars containing mixed phase matter and can be ignored in calculations .",
    "this paper focus on studying a new mechanism in heating generation inside hybrid stars , our consideration of initial period @xmath66 is reasonable for millisecond pulsars , but is too short for classical pulsars with higher magnetic field strengths .",
    "so the more reasonable initial period is needed in the accurate calculations comparing with the observations .",
