    "the value of @xmath81 in eq .   is a tight upper bound , as it is attained for the corresponding eigenvector @xmath82 solving eq .  , which exists",

    "in summary , we exploited the relations between quantum channels and bipartite quantum states .",
    "we derived a method that allowed us to construct the corresponding witnesses .",
    "we performed a full analytical characterization of pure states , e.g. , for estimating the amount of imperfections a quantum property can withstand .    in a first step , we identified two maximal quantum channels , random unitary and random projective channels .",
    "random unitaries are completely characterized by a deterministic evolution and classical statistics .",
    "the complement was introduced as a random projective channel .",
    "these kinds of processes are governed by the quantum measurement - induced state collapse .",
    "its relation to entanglement - breaking channels was discussed . applying the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism",
    ", we could show that these channels are mapped onto two complementary forms of bipartite quantum states .",
    "the isomorphism acts in an anticorrelated way : the quantum - dominated projective channels are transformed into classically correlated states , and deterministic unitary channels are mapped onto maximally entangled states .    in a second step , a technique for constructing witnesses",
    "was derived to probe nonrandom unitary channels or , equivalently , nonmaximally entangled states .",
    "the resulting , generalized eigenvalue equations have been compared with a related approach to uncover inseparable states or , equivalently , nonprojective quantum channels .",
    "some examples underlined the general functionality of our method . with a single observable",
    ", one can perform a joint witnessing of inseparable and nonmaximally entangles states . moreover , the computed bounds for the witnessing are tight .",
    "an example of particular interest was formulated in terms of rank - one operators being defined by a single pure state .",
    "we showed that the maximal overlap of this state with maximally entangled ones is given in terms of the @xmath66-norm of the vector of schmidt coefficients , whereas the maximal fidelity with product states is given by its @xmath183-norm .",
    "finally , we introduced a complementary schmidt decomposition .",
    "contrary to the standard expansion with orthonormal separable states , the complementary schmidt decomposition expands a state in terms of maximally entangled ones .",
    "in particular , the schmidt coefficients and the complementary schmidt coefficients are connected via a discrete fourier transform .    in conclusion ,",
    "our method is useful to characterize channels and states of a classical or quantum character in a unified manner .",
    "because witnesses define tangent hyperplanes to the studied convex sets , the presented approach allows one to identify the full geometry .",
    "some steps in this direction have been done in the present work . moreover , our criteria , e.g. , in terms of the presented correlation measurements , are directly applicable in present experiments .",
    "the authors acknowledge support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through sfb 652/3 .",
    "in this appendix , we will provide some simple , yet useful relations for the representation of bipartite pure states .",
    "first , any pure state can be written as @xmath249 with @xmath250 and @xmath251 .",
    "inserting @xmath188 yields the proper decomposition of the state @xmath252 .",
    "second , we have @xmath253 expanding both operators in the computational basis , @xmath254 and @xmath255 , proves this relation .",
    "third , the following equivalence obviously holds : @xmath256 which is a direct consequence of the identity  .",
    "finally , one can directly evaluate that @xmath257",
    "in this appendix , we generalize the proof of chebyshev s sum inequality for our needs .",
    "the standard form of this inequality states that for two ordered sequences , @xmath258 and @xmath259 , one has @xmath260 and if one ( and only one ) of the sequences has the inverse ordering , then the inequality   changes the relation to `` @xmath261 '' .",
    "in addition to this well - known form , let us assume a symmetric matrix of non - negative elements , @xmath262 for a unitary operator @xmath31 .",
    "suppose we have two finite and sorted sequences of numbers , @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "it then holds that @xmath265 with @xmath266 for all @xmath267 .",
    "the expansion of the latter expression yields @xmath268 replacing @xmath269 in the second and fourth terms and using the symmetry of @xmath270 , we get @xmath271 a_ib_i-2\\sum_{i , j}g_{i , j}a_ib_j\\geq0 .      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this can be rewritten in the form of a generalized chebyshev s sum inequality , @xmath272 where we took into account that for any unitary @xmath31 , one has @xmath273 .",
    "in addition , we may define the unitary permutation operation @xmath274 and @xmath275 for @xmath276 .",
    "now we have @xmath277 similarly to the proof above , one can show that @xmath278 holds for any unitary @xmath31 .",
    "the standard computational basis @xmath279 is a product basis . in this section , an orthonormal basis of me states",
    "it reads as @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "the expansion coefficients represent the kernel of the discrete fourier transform and the state of the second mode relates to the discrete convolution .",
    "we may also define the two unitary operators @xmath282 and @xmath283 to see that these states are me states : @xmath284 with this form , we can also verify that these states are @xmath285 orthonormal ones and , thus , form an orthonormal basis .",
    "we have @xmath286 in the case @xmath287 , the resulting sum is empty .",
    "the missing part is given by the geometric series relation : @xmath288 .",

    "<S> modern applications in quantum computation and quantum communication require the precise characterization of quantum states and quantum channels . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , this means that one has to determine the quantum capacity of a physical system in terms of measurable quantities . </S>",
    "<S> witnesses , if properly constructed , succeed in performing this task . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a method that is capable to compute witnesses for identifying deterministic evolutions and measurement - induced collapse processes . at the same time , applying the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism , it uncovers the entanglement characteristics of bipartite quantum states . remarkably , a statistical mixture of unitary evolutions is mapped onto mixtures of maximally entangled states , and classical separable states originate from genuine quantum - state reduction maps . based on our treatment , we are able to witness these opposing attributes at once and , furthermore , obtain an insight into their different geometric structures . </S>",
    "<S> the complementarity is further underpinned by formulating a complementary schmidt decomposition of a state in terms of maximally entangled states and discrete fourier - transformed schmidt coefficients . </S>"
