    "after the discovery of the high-@xmath11 materials@xcite , the study of correlations has gained interested due to the fact that there is the belief@xcite that the normal properties of these materials could be explained in the framework of the hubbard model@xcite , since electron correlations are strong , i.e. , the on - site electron - electron repulsions @xmath12 are much larger than the energies associated to the hybridization of atomic orbitals belonging to different atoms@xcite .",
    "we consider the study of correlations in the hubbard model as a rewarding task since it will shed light on still unsolved points of the novel materials .",
    "for example , at high temperatures ( @xmath13 ) these htsc cuprates , which are poor conductors , become superconductors .",
    "this feature is strange indeed because the coulomb repulsion is strong .",
    "contrary to the predictions of the fermi liquid theory , the resistivity at @xmath14 and optimum doping is linear in temperature , i.e. , @xmath15@xcite .",
    "this suggests a very strong scattering of elementary excitations .",
    "a discussion of the possible breakdown of fermi liquid theory is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "in the present work we explore the effects of having a non  fermi liquid behavior into the one  particle and double - occupied dynamical properties .",
    "we will use the moment approach ( or sum rules ) of nolting@xcite for the spectral density , @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known in the literature@xcite that the moment approach in the spherical approximation - when the narrowing band factor , @xmath16 , is not @xmath17 - dependent - _ always _ gives a gap in the density of states @xmath18 .",
    "if the chemical potential happens to be in this gap , then we _ always _ have an insulator .",
    "it has been argued that the way to cure this unrealistic gap is to have a better approximation for the narrowing band factor , @xmath16 .",
    "we have followed a different path which consists in proposing a single pole structure in the self - energy , @xmath0 . closing the gap for small and intermediate values of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the bandwidth and @xmath21 in two dimensions ) ,",
    "is not the only rationality behind our calculation .",
    "it is well documented@xcite that correlations give rise to lifetime contributions that conspire against the very definition of quasi ",
    "particles at the chemical potential .",
    "this leads to an eventual collapse of the fermi liquid picture of adiabaticity between the electron gas and the electron liquid so well described by the phenomenological treatment of landau .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ ii ] , we present our model hamiltonian and our self  energy proposal , in which we try to justify our bold choice , as one step forward to understand the physics behind the moment approach of nolting . this led us to come up with an ansatz which is not zero at zero frequency , i.e. , our system is not a fermi liquid for any value of the interaction .",
    "we could argue that our ansatz is valid for energy scales not too close to the chemical potential .",
    "however , our ansatz has to become exact in the limit of @xmath22 . in section [ iii ] , we present our results which consist of the real and imaginary parts of the self ",
    "energy , and spectral functions of the one- and two  particle green functions along the diagonal of the brillouin zone , for different values of the interaction .",
    "we have used a system size of @xmath23 . in section [ iv ]",
    "we present our conclusions and the future trends .",
    "the model we study is the hubbard hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) are creation ( annihilation ) electron operators with spin @xmath27 . @xmath28 . @xmath12 is the local interaction , @xmath29 the chemical potential and we work in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we have adopted einstein convention for repeated indices , i.e. , for the @xmath30 sites @xmath31 , the @xmath32 nearest - neighbor sites @xmath33 @xmath34 and for spin up and down ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "@xmath36 , for @xmath37 and zero otherwise .",
    "let us propose for the self ",
    "energy , @xmath0 , the following single pole ansatz @xmath38 with our choice for @xmath0 , we have that the real and imaginary parts of the self  energy",
    "* do * satisfy the kramers ",
    "kronig relations@xcite , since it is analytic in one of half of the complex plane . in fact , the physical solution to the problem is when @xmath39 , as it can be checked by finding the roots of @xmath5 in the complex plane .",
    "we postpone the discussion of this point for the conclusions . the ansatz given in eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) has some similarity with the hubbard ",
    "i solution@xcite .",
    "however , we have neglected any frequency dependence in the damping .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath3 is @xmath4independent but strongly @xmath12dependent .",
    "the validity of luttinger theorem@xcite has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we argue that most likely the luttinger theorem is not going to hold because we have a non  fermi liquid system . our choice of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) , the hartree ",
    "shift , is very convenient since it redefines an effective chemical potential , @xmath41 .",
    "this effective potential is zero at half  filling , @xmath42 , since @xmath43 there .",
    "then , @xmath44 means that we are at the chemical potential .",
    "we want to explicitly state that our choice ( eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) ) has the advantage of requiring only three sum rules to be satisfied , instead of four as in the now normal procedure of nolting@xcite which starts from the spectral function , @xmath6 , itself .",
    "we add that if @xmath45 , then we go back to nolting s canonical results . in this case@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath16 is the narrowing band factor .",
    "the @xmath4independent narrowing band factor , @xmath47 , is calculated in closed form in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is a self  consistent quantity , though . the @xmath4dependent narrowing band factor , @xmath48 , has been evaluated recently by herrmann and nolting@xcite using a two  pole ansatz with the two poles located at the same energies than the poles of the one  particle green function .",
    "this treatment , beyond the spherical treatment of nolting@xcite , can be mapped into the calculations of kishore and granato@xcite with appropiate identification of our parameters in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "their approach gives a mott metal  insulator transition .",
    "all this means that the metal ",
    "insulator transition ( mmit ) is embedded into the hubbard model and it does not require of lifetime effects to accomplish this .",
    "however , once more , lifetime effects are a natural element of the many  body physics for intermediate and strongly correlated electron systems where the concept of quasi  particle does not apply any longer .",
    "we do not pursue anymore here the mmit , but the interested reader is addressed to references@xcite .    by definition",
    "the one  particle green function , @xmath5 , in terms of @xmath0 , is given as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "also , we will require the one  particle spectral density , @xmath6 , which is defined as @xmath51    using eqs .",
    "( [ single ] - [ akw ] ) , we arrive to the following expression for the spectral density @xmath52    using the first three sum rules of nolting@xcite for the the spectral function of eq .",
    "( [ akw ] ) we obtain the following equations @xmath53 where the @xmath54 s , @xmath55 , are the first three moments@xcite . for example , the first moment ( @xmath56 ) is the area below the curve of @xmath6 vs @xmath7 , the second moment ( @xmath57 ) is the center of gravity of the spectral function and the second order moment ( or third moment , @xmath58 ) is related to the width of the spectral function , @xmath6 .",
    "so , damping effects are controlled by the second order sum rule .",
    "we do not use the fourth moment or sum rule because we have three @xmath4dependent unknown parameters ( our way of working is different to one of nolting since in the latter we have to use four moments .",
    "the difference lies in the fact that he starts with the one  particle spectral density ) .",
    "we could guess that in order to extend the canonical formalism of nolting to include lifetime effects , starting from his two pole ansatz , we should have to postulate the following structure for @xmath5 @xmath59 from where we see that we would need five moments or sum rules because we have five parameters to determine , i.e. , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath3 , with @xmath62 . with the proposal ( eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) ) we have only three parameters to calculate .",
    "we assume that at @xmath42 the chemical potential , @xmath43 . the density of states which results of the two pole ansatz for the one  particle green function , in the spherical approximation of nolting@xcite , always has a gap .",
    "this solution ( always a gap ) is known in the literature as the hubbard ",
    "i solution@xcite which has been critized since many years ago by laura roth@xcite , among others .",
    "we call the attention to ref.@xcite where the authors point out to the fact that the @xmath4-dependence has to be included in @xmath16 . a recent calculation by kirchhofer@xcite is performed at the mean field level for the @xmath4dependence of the band narrowing factor , when the two hubbard bands are separated . in a more elaborated calculation based on the mori s formalism@xcite for the one  particle green function , kirchhoffer et al@xcite obtain three peaks in the spectral density , @xmath6 , which respects particle  hole symmetry . in the end , they get a mott metal insulator transition , for @xmath63 . here",
    "we are including lifetime effects as a crucial ingredient in the formulation beyond a mean  field treatment .",
    "kirchhofer@xcite also considers the presence of antiferromagnetism fluctuations in an empirical way .",
    "we could extend kirchhoffer et al s calculations using the numerical values of the dynamical spin susceptibility , @xmath64 , in the spin  fermin model of superconductivity of pines , chubukov and others@xcite .",
    "the dynamical spin susceptibility has been obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in the high @xmath11 cuprates . in section [ iii ]",
    ", we present our numerical results and their interpretation .",
    "1a , 1b and 1c we present the _ spectral density _ , @xmath6 , vs @xmath7 along the diagonal of the brillouin zone ( @xmath65 ) for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "we are working with a finite system of periodicity of @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath69 we have a double  peaked structure , with visible lifetime effects ( the dirac delta functions of nolting now have width ) .",
    "this is a feature of correlated electron systems as it has been discussed in the work of schneider et al@xcite for the case of @xmath70 .",
    "the physics is different but the peak structure is similar . for @xmath71 we still observe the double peak structure but lifetime effects are stronger . finally , for @xmath72 , the double peak structure is practically washed out . as we see ,",
    "lifetime effects are very much pronounced for the larger values of @xmath19 presented , i.e. , for @xmath73 .",
    "the two peaks of @xmath6 vs @xmath7 are separated approximately by a distance of @xmath74 .    in figs .",
    "2a , 2b and 2c we show the imaginary part of the self ",
    "energy , @xmath75 $ ] , vs @xmath7 along the diagonal of the brillouin zone for the same values of @xmath19 of fig .",
    "again we observe that for increasing values of @xmath19 , damping effects are stronger in the self  energy , as is the case in the one  particle spectral function ( see figs .",
    "1a , 1b and 1c ) .",
    "in addition , we do not observe any fermi liquid dependence ( in frequency ) of the imaginary part of the self ",
    "energy around @xmath44 .",
    "this is due to our choice of our ansatz ( eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) ) .",
    "we could include fermi or marginal fermi liquid behavior close to the chemical potential as it is suggested in section [ iv ] .",
    "however , within the present work , we could say that our approximation is valid for frequencies not too close to the chemical potential .",
    "certaintly , for small values of @xmath19 , we should have some fermi liquid behavior ( at least in 2d ) , like an imaginary self  energy going to zero as positive power of @xmath7 at the chemical potential@xcite .    in fig .",
    "3a , 3b and 3c we report results for the real part of the self  energy , @xmath76 $ ] , vs @xmath7 along the diagonal of the brillouin zone for the same values of interaction of fig .",
    "1 . for @xmath66",
    "we see a more o less regular pattern .",
    "however , for @xmath72 , lifetime effects lead to big effects in @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "for example , the curves are no longer regularly displaced with respect to one another .",
    "also , the frequency range increases appreciably and the heights of the curves decrease .",
    "let us comment that the numerical form of the real part of the self ",
    "energy clearly shows that the kramers  kronig relations for the self ",
    "energy are satisfied , in order to have the roots of the one  particle green function on the same side of the complex plane .",
    "analitically , it can be proved too . the only requirement coming out of these calculations , with our ansatz ,",
    "is that @xmath77@xcite ( see appendix a ) . as @xmath78 , then @xmath79 .",
    "this considerations we have checked in further numerical calculations with lattice sizes of @xmath80 . due to these new findings , we correct the results of ref.@xcite since the solutions we found there must satisfy the conditions established here , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath81 .",
    "we have investigated the dynamical quantities , @xmath6 , @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath82 $ ] , vs @xmath7 along the diagonal of the brillouin zone , for three values of the interaction , namely , @xmath101 . in all these quantities",
    "we observe that the role of correlations and lifetime effects is fundamental .",
    "for example , for values of @xmath102 the one  particle spectral density becomes almost one  peak , while @xmath75 $ ] becomes a wider inverted lorentzian .",
    "$ ] , for @xmath72 has lost all sign of regularity .",
    "@xmath6 becomes featureless for large values of @xmath19 .",
    "our treatment of @xmath5 and @xmath9 is not perturbative since we impose sum rules to @xmath6 to find @xmath0 and @xmath9 is found from the equation of motion technique ( eq .",
    "( [ twoge ] ) ) .",
    "the choice of self  energy ( eq . ( [ single ] ) is an attempt to shed some light on nolting approach to which eq .",
    "( [ single ] ) reduces when @xmath45@xcite . nolting s study ( when looked upon with our optics , i.e. , @xmath45 , in ref.@xcite ) is also a non  fermi liquid .",
    "our ansatz for @xmath0 is rather phenomenological , since we have not invoked any microscopic mechanism to postulate it ( eq . ( [ single ] ) ) .",
    "however , we have been guided by the single pole structure of nolting without lifetime effects .",
    "this structure has been fleshed out in a recent paper@xcite .",
    "also , we have relied on the calculations of kishore and granato@xcite which represent a non  fermi liquid approach for the self  energy .",
    "those interested in a nice interpretation of non  fermi liquid behavior of the experimental data of high  temperature cuprates , please see ref.@xcite .",
    "work is in progress@xcite to include fermi liquid features close to the chemical potential .",
    "according to our belief , this type of considerations are much harder to be tackled with the procedure of nolting , i.e. , two poles in the one  particle spectral function , @xmath103 .",
    "for example , the self  energy proposals of norman et al@xcite , for the overdoped and underdoped regimes of the cuprate superconductors , can be numerically solved for the attractive hubbard model@xcite , for @xmath104wave superconductivity , where off  diagonal green functiond are called for .",
    "a single pole structure in @xmath0 goes beyond the hubbard ",
    "i approximation , since the hubbard ",
    "i approximation is also equivalent to choose a single pole in @xmath9 ( without lifetime effects ) .",
    "this can easily be checked due to the exact relationship given in eq .",
    "( [ gamma_2sigma ] ) .",
    "however , by comparing the results for the moments without lifetime effects we find that @xmath105 which proves that our choice for @xmath0 is , at least , a second order expansion in @xmath12 .",
    "this is in agreement with the theoretical findings of appendix a , since @xmath39 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 is almost @xmath4independent .",
    "similarly , we find that @xmath79 is independent of @xmath4 , but strongly dependent on @xmath12 . in consequence",
    ", our numerical study proves that our ansatz is the easiest way to include lifetime effects and to consider fermi and/or marginal fermi liquid behavior in the original proposal of the moment approach of nolting .",
