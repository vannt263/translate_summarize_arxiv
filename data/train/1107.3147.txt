    "in the absence of morphological information to distinguish early and late - type galaxies , the use of uv - optical colors has emerged as a commonly employed proxy in studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "this practice is bolstered by the color bimodality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , galaxies are often divided in a color - magnitude or color - mass diagram into red and blue , and the evolution in the luminosity or mass function of each color type tracked over cosmic time ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and several others ) .",
    "the underlying assumption in the method above is that the red galaxies represent quiescent systems with little or no ongoing star - formation ( sf ) .",
    "however , it is well known that a reddened star forming galaxy ( sfg ) can display colors coincident with those on the red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "selecting red galaxies based on a single rest - frame color , in combination with a magnitude or stellar mass , therefore results in a selection of both quiescent galaxies _ and _ reddened sfgs .",
    "this presents a predicament for studies that use such a selection in order to quantify the evolution in the number of passive systems .    in this letter",
    ", we highlight the utility of a color - color diagram , specifically rest - frame @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 ( hereafter referred to as the @xmath2 diagram ) , in distinguishing quiescent galaxies from sfgs , including those sfgs that are heavily reddened .",

    "we hinted at the possibility of the @xmath2 selection of quiescent and sfgs being used to also distinguish morphologically early and late - type systems .",
    "here we introduce for the first time an analysis based on _ hst _ acs imaging and examine the structural properties of galaxies in @xmath2 color space in order to address the prospects of using two rest - frame colors in classifying both the recent sfhs and morphologies of galaxies .",
    "we use a stellar mass - limited sample of galaxies at @xmath3  to carry out our analysis .",
    "as is well known , many galaxy properties correlate with stellar mass and it is therefore crucial that one control for stellar mass in interpreting results . the redshift range examined here provides a suitable case study for a sample of galaxies in the distant universe .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath8-band magnitudes at these redshifts represent observed @xmath9 , which is typically the reddest bandpass accessible from the ground for deep wide - field galaxy surveys .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",

    "the @xmath16-band was used for spectroscopic selection ( @xmath17  mag ) .",
    "we obtained spectroscopy with imacs on magellan , using a low - dispersion prism ( ldp ) in place of the grating .",
    "roughly @xmath18 redshifts were measured over a @xmath19  deg@xmath20 field .",
    "the overall spectroscopic completeness is @xmath21 .",
    "our sample in this work is restricted to galaxies in the redshift range @xmath3 , with the lower redshift cutoff determined by the bright magnitude limit of our survey and the upper redshift cutoff determined by the desired mass cut and with some consideration for the redshift precision . in this redshift interval ,",
    "the ldp redshifts have a precision of @xmath22 when compared to redshifts obtained from higher resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we find 3326  galaxies in this redshift interval with @xmath23  mag .",
    "we fit ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as bc03 ) @xmath24-models to seds comprised of both the broadband photometry and ldp spectra in order to extract relevant rest - frame quantities such as stellar masses .",
    "the limiting stellar mass for constructing representative samples of both star - forming and passive galaxies is determined by the latter and is @xmath25  @xmath26  ( @xmath410.25 ) at @xmath27 .",
    "the sed fitting procedure also provides measurements of [ oii]@xmath7    luminosities .",
    "rest - frame magnitudes and colors were computed with the ground - based imaging and using the @xmath28-correction technique described in @xcite .",
    "we use _ hst _ acs imaging @xcite to measure the structural properties of galaxies . about @xmath29 of our mass - limited sample with @xmath9 imaging has acs coverage in either the f775w or f814w filter .",
    "the color postage stamps shown in the next section are for the subset of our sample with acs coverage in two filters ( i.e. , either f606w and f814w , or f625w and f775w ) .",

    "we also measured the bumpiness parameter , @xmath14 , which provides an estimate of the higher order structure within galaxies and is defined as the ratio of the rms of the residual from the galfit model fit and the model mean ( see , e.g , * ? ? ?",

    "our final mass - limited sample at @xmath3  with @xmath9 imaging and measured structural parameters from _ hst _ imaging is comprised of 486  galaxies .",
    "in figure  [ fig_uvj_letter ] we present the rest - frame @xmath2-diagram for a stellar mass - limited sample at @xmath3 .",
    "the combination of these two colors allow one to break the degeneracy between age and reddening for red galaxies as discussed below .",
    "quiescent galaxies are delineated from sfgs using the boundary computed by @xcite .",
    "we note that this boundary results in @xmath33 of galaxies with @xmath34  ab mag being classified as sfgs .",
    "this fraction does not vary significantly for different mass bins above our mass cut .",
    "figure  [ fig_uvj_letter]@xmath35 shows a gray scale representation of the density of points in the @xmath2 diagram .",
    "the concentration of quiescent galaxies is distinct from the broader distribution of @xmath2 classified sfgs .",
    "model star formation histories ( sfhs ) reinforce the @xcite division between quiescent and sfgs in the @xmath2 diagram . the color evolution of a bc03 solar metallicity single burst ( ssp ) and constant star formation rate model ( csf ) are shown in figure  [ fig_uvj_letter]@xmath36 .",
    "after @xmath37  gyr , the ssp lies in the region of the @xmath2 diagram populated by quiescent galaxies .",
    "meanwhile , after @xmath38  gyr , the csf lies in the star forming region of the @xmath2 diagram where no galaxies with mass @xmath25  @xmath26  can be found .",
    "however , the reddening vector , computed assuming a @xcite reddening law , suggests that the addition of varying amounts of extinction can explain a large range of colors for sfgs above our mass limit .",
    "@xcite show the color evolution of more complex sfhs in the @xmath2 diagram , including bursts and other composite sfhs .",
    "we reiterate their finding that the slightest amount of star formation ( sf ) on top of a dominant older stellar population can easily move galaxies from the quiescent region to the star forming region .",
    "the ssp and csf models shown here are intended to provide a simple overview of the kinds of sfhs that can produce colors consistent with @xmath2 classified quiescent and sfgs .",
    "finally , @xcite showed that mips 24  detections primarily trace the region of the @xmath2 diagram occupied by sfgs including those with the reddest colors ( @xmath34  ab mag ) , therefore providing empirical support for the @xcite boundary .      with _ hst _ acs imaging",
    ", we gain a new understanding for the kinds of galaxies that populate various regions of the @xmath2 diagram .",
    "these data provide perhaps the most informative explanation as to why the @xmath2 selection works as well as it does . in figure",
    "[ fig_uvj_acs_binmass ] , for three different mass bins , we show the @xmath2 diagram populated with _ hst _",
    "acs color postage stamps for the subset of galaxies with acs coverage .",
    "each color - color bin ( 0.15  mag in size ) is represented with a postage stamp of a random galaxy within the bin .",
    "these images display rest - frame light at @xmath39   , similar to the wavelength range probed by the @xmath0 color .",
    "the contrast in structure between galaxies selected in the @xmath2 diagram to be quiescent versus star forming is striking .",
    "the quiescent region is populated primarily by early - type galaxies . in contrast , the star forming region is dominated by late - type galaxies .    in figure  [ fig_uvj_sersic_bumpiness ] , we look more quantitatively at the structural properties of galaxies in the @xmath2 diagram for the same three mass bins as figure  [ fig_uvj_acs_binmass ] .",
    "the symbols indicate whether galaxies have @xmath6 ( asterisks ) or @xmath5 ( diamonds ) and are color - coded according to the bumpiness value , @xmath14 .",
    "galaxies with higher order structure , suggestive of dust and/or sf in late - type systems , have higher values of @xmath14 .    in the quiescent region of the @xmath2 diagram ,",
    "the fraction of galaxies with @xmath5 for the low , intermediate , and high mass bin is @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "we note that most of the quiescent galaxies with @xmath6 generally have low @xmath14 values , indicating featureless profiles .",
    "the somewhat higher fraction at lower masses generally reside in more over - dense environments relative to @xmath6 sfgs , and could therefore represent quenched satellites .",
    "thus , in all mass bins , the quiescent region is indeed dominated by galaxies with concentrated and/or featureless surface brightness profiles typical of early - type galaxies .    in the star - forming region of the @xmath2 diagram ,",
    "the proportion of galaxies that have @xmath6 for the low , intermediate , and high mass bin is @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "thus , a substantial fraction of sfgs are not best - fit with low srsic indices indicative of disk - dominated systems , especially at higher masses . however , for those sfgs with @xmath5 , most also have high values for @xmath14 indicating the presence of higher order structure common to late - type galaxies .",
    "these galaxies generally have strong bulges , likely responsible for driving the srsic fit , but also a visually identifiable disk component with strong dust and/or sf , a key difference from the @xmath5 quiescent systems .",
    "thus , the quiescent and star forming regions of the @xmath2 diagram have been shown here to correspond closely to the traditional morphological classes of early and late - type galaxies .",
    "as previously noted , sfgs span a wide range of colors in the @xmath2 diagram .",
    "there are two possibilities for the source of this diversity in the @xmath2 colors at a fixed mass : ( 1 ) differences in the amount of reddening , and/or ( 2 ) differences in the sfhs .",
    "metallicity is not expected to be a significant factor , given that at a fixed mass , the variation in metallicity is only @xmath46  dex @xcite . for a csf model ,",
    "this variation in metallicity would result in a negligible change in the @xmath0 color and a change of only @xmath46  mag in the @xmath1 color , which is not enough to explain the broad range of @xmath2 colors for sfgs .",
    "we focus on option ( 1 ) above in this letter and will show that this component can account for a significant portion of the variation in @xmath2 colors for sfgs . in fact , figure  [ fig_uvj_acs_binmass ] hints at a trend between the viewing inclination of sfgs , which is related to the degree of reddening , and @xmath2 colors . while bluer sfgs appear to be viewed closer to face - on , redder sfgs are more likely to be viewed closer to edge - on .",
    "this is apparent for all mass bins .",
    "figure  [ fig_boa_vjproj ] reinforces the interpretation that the colors of sfgs are driven to a large degree by the viewing angle . in this figure , we limit our analysis to @xmath6 sfgs because the impact due to inclination is easier to gauge on these systems that are more likely to be disk - dominated .",
    "figure  [ fig_boa_vjproj]@xmath36 shows the axis ratio , @xmath30 , vs. @xmath47 , for sfgs with @xmath6 .",
    "the axis ratio serves as a proxy for the inclination .",
    "the quantity @xmath47  is simply the value of @xmath1 a sfg would have after projecting its @xmath0 and @xmath1 colors onto a reddening vector that runs through the @xmath48  gyr csf time step ( dashed black line in figure  [ fig_uvj_letter]@xmath35 ) . in simpler terms",
    ", we are examining how the properties of sfgs vary along the reddening vector . for @xmath6 systems ,",
    "figure  [ fig_boa_vjproj]@xmath36 shows a clear correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath47  for galaxies in all mass bins .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficients for the low , intermediate , and high mass bin are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 respectively , where the uncertainties are computed by bootstrapping .",
    "these values suggest a strong correlation between the two quantities .",
    "we use the models by @xcite to estimate the reddening in @xmath0 and @xmath1 resulting from inclining a dusty disk . the results for their sbc model galaxy at @xmath52 ( inclination , @xmath53 ) implies @xmath54  mag and @xmath55  mag relative to a face - on orientation or equivalently @xmath56  mag for @xmath47 .",
    "this is comparable to the observed spread in @xmath47  seen in figure  [ fig_boa_vjproj]@xmath36 ( black arrow ) but slightly higher than the values implied for low redshift sfgs studied by @xcite .",
    "the reddening due to dust could simply be lower in disks at low redshift .",
    "since sfgs with redder @xmath47  are more likely to be viewed closer to edge - on , one would expect light from star forming regions to be extincted within such highly inclined disks .",
    "figure  [ fig_boa_vjproj]@xmath35 shows [ oii]@xmath7    luminosities , normalized by stellar mass , versus @xmath47  for the same sample of sfgs as in figure  [ fig_boa_vjproj]@xmath36 .",
    "the [ oii]@xmath7    luminosities decline at redder @xmath47  at a fixed mass by roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "this finding provides further support for the interpretation that the @xmath2 colors of disk - dominated sfgs are driven by the viewing angle .",
    "if the decline in [ oii]@xmath7    luminosity with @xmath47  for sfgs was instead driven by a drop in the sfr , we would not expect to find large numbers of such galaxies in the star forming region of the @xmath2 diagram .",
    "for example , a factor of @xmath57 drop in the sfr of a csf model at @xmath48  gyr , would result in such a galaxy moving into the quiescent region after only @xmath58  myr .",
    "additionally , the predicted decline in @xmath59}/m$ ] due to inclination from the @xcite models follows the data quite well ( black arrow ) .",
    "the correlations between @xmath30 or @xmath59}/m$ ] and @xmath47  is almost as strong at the highest masses , suggesting that inclination is an important factor in that mass regime as well .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the highest mass bin lacks objects that populate the bluer star forming regions of the @xmath2 diagram ( see figure  [ fig_uvj_sersic_bumpiness ] ) , where lower mass objects can be found",
    ". this suggests less vigorous sf in higher mass sfgs ( i.e. , lower specific sfr ) , in accord with the findings of other works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also possibly higher levels of dust and therefore reddening in these galaxies relative to lower mass ones ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) when viewed face - on .",
    "the spread in @xmath2 colors for @xmath5 sfgs is also significant .",
    "however , their colors do not show a strong correlation with axis ratio . visual inspection of these systems suggests strong dust in the redder @xmath5 sfgs .",
    "thus , the dust geometry is possibly more complex or the inclination is not easily connected to the axis ratio ( as can be the case for triaxial systems ) , leading to a poor correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath47 .",
    "we note however , that @xcite find strong inclination dependent attenuation in nearby bulges .",
    "in the rest - frame @xmath2 diagram , quiescent galaxies occupy a concentrated region of color space that is distinct from the sequence of @xmath2 colors of sfgs , which extends onto the red sequence . utilizing _",
    "hst _ acs imaging for the first time to study the structural parameters of galaxies in the @xmath2 diagram at @xmath3 , we find that the commonly employed @xmath2 selection of quiescent and sfgs corresponds closely to the distinction between traditional morphological classes of early and late - type galaxies",
    ". meanwhile , the position of a sfg along the extended sequence of @xmath2 colors is determined to a large degree by its stellar mass and viewing inclination .",
    "systems that are closer to edge - on generally display redder @xmath2 colors and have lower [ oii]@xmath7    luminosity per unit mass as a consequence of the reddening from dust within the inclined disks .",
