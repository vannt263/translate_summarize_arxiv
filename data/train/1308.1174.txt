    "recent advances in embedded computation and communication have boosted the emergence of cyber - physical systems .",
    "cyber - physical systems are characterized by the strong coupling between the cyber space and the physical world . a number of cyber - physical systems ; e.g. , autonomous vehicles and the power grid , operate with time - varying computing resources in dynamically changing and uncertain operating environments .",
    "this feature demands that the controllers are synthesized in an _ anytime _ and online fashion where a feasible controller is quickly returned and its optimality is continuously improved as more processing time is available .",
    "a fundamental problem of cyber - physical systems is safety control ; i.e. , controlling dynamic systems to achieve the given objectives and simultaneously stay in the given safety sets .",
    "a possible formulation is the approach - evasion differential games where one player , say the angle , desires to steer the system states to the goal set as soon as possible and maintain the system states inside the safety set and the objective of the other player , say the demon , is completely opposite .",
    "there are mainly two classes of numerical schemes for the approach - evasion differential games : one is based on viscosity solutions of partial differential equations ( pdes ) ; e.g. , in  @xcite , and the other is built on viability theory ; e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "both methods are built on the _ multi - grid _ successive approximation ( or coarse - to - refined ) approach in ; i.e. ,  @xcite and the asymptotic optimality is provable . on the other hand , one can always replace the multi - grid method by the _ fixed - grid _ method in the above papers where a grid with fixed resolution is chosen before implementing the algorithms . for this method ,",
    "the approximation error is determined by the fixed gird resolution , and their relation could be very challenging to characterize , especially for the constrained nonlinear system of interest .",
    "in addition , a single predetermined gird is not capable of dealing with different scenarios in dynamically changing environments .    in the robotics society",
    ", a relevant problem of robotic motion planning has been receiving considerable attention . in robotic motion planning ,",
    "a feasible , collision - free and open - loop path through a cluttered environment is found , connecting an initial configuration or state to a target region .",
    "it is well - known that the problem is computationally challenging  @xcite .",
    "the rapidly - exploring random tree ( rrt ) algorithm and its variants ; e.g. , in  @xcite , are able to find a feasible path quickly .",
    "recently , two novel algorithms , prm@xmath0 and rrt@xmath0 , have been developed in  @xcite , and shown to be computationally efficient and asymptotically optimal .",
    "the methodology of incremental sampling in  @xcite has been extended to stochastic optimal control in  @xcite and stochastic filtering in  @xcite .",
    "_ contributions . _",
    "the paper proposes a class of novel anytime computation algorithms to solve the approach - evasion differential games , and our algorithms significantly outperform the multi - grid method both theoretically and numerically . in particular , we first propose the @xmath1 algorithm by leveraging incremental sampling and viability theory in  @xcite . on the basis of random samples , a sequence of games discrete in the time , states and inputs are constructed to approximate the original game continuous in the time , states and inputs . at each iteration ,",
    "the values of the state samples are updated _ only once _ in an _ asynchronous _ way . the asymptotic convergence of the @xmath1 algorithm is formally ensured for all the initial states in contrast to a single initial state in  @xcite .",
    "we refer the readers to section  [ sec : isaddle - discussion ] for a further detailed theoretic comparison with  @xcite .",
    "the new feature asynchronism of @xmath1 offers a greater freedom for the online section of sample updates , and opens up a number of opportunities to improve the computational efficiency .",
    "we then propose the variation of the @xmath2 algorithm which explicitly exploits the asynchronism .",
    "in particular , @xmath2 maintains a set of directed trees at each iteration and utilizes a novel _ cascade update rule _",
    ", only updating a subset of state samples whose child changes its estimate at the previous iteration .",
    "@xmath2 maintains the same convergence property as @xmath1 .",
    "most importantly , through the homicidal - chauffeur differential game , we numerically demonstrate that @xmath1 is faster than the multi - grid method in  @xcite and @xmath2 is significantly faster than @xmath1 .",
    "the anytime property of @xmath2 is also shown in the numerical simulations .",
    "due to the space limitation , the analysis is omitted in the current paper and provided in the enlarged version  @xcite .",
    "_ literature review .",
    "_ among the limited number of differential games for which closed - form solutions have been derived are the homicidal - chauffeur and the lady - in - the - lake games  @xcite which are played in unobstructed environments .",
    "for more complicated games , numerical methods must be used to determine solutions .",
    "the pde - based and viability - based methods are two main approaches to solve the approach - evasion differential games . for the pde - based method in  @xcite ,",
    "the optimal value functions are characterized as the viscosity solutions of hamilton - jacobi - isaacs equations , and existing numerical schemes for pdes are applied to approximate the viscosity solutions .",
    "this method demands the continuity of the optimal value functions .",
    "unfortunately , this assumption is restrictive , and does not hold for many such games of interest .",
    "the more recent viability - based approach in  @xcite instead characterizes the optimal value functions via discriminating kernels of the hamiltonian , and further solve the games through approximating discriminating kernels .",
    "this method relaxes the continuity assumption on the optimal value functions .",
    "another relevant set of references is about the reachability analysis of dynamic systems . in particular",
    ", the papers  @xcite study the reachability problem in the framework of hamilton - jacobi equations .",
    "numerical algorithms based on level - set methods , e.g. , in  @xcite , have been applied to reachability computation ; e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we will present the game formulation of interest and introduce a set of notations and primitive procedures .",
    "after that , we will summarize some existing results on viability theory .      consider a pair of players , say the angel and the demon .",

    "[ asm1 ]    a sufficient condition for ( a3 ) in assumption  [ asm1 ] is that the set of @xmath17 is convex and the function @xmath18 is affine with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "we now proceed to describe the game of interest where the objectives of the angel and the demon are completely opposite . in particular",
    ", the angel desires to steer @xmath25 to his open goal set @xmath26 as soon as possible and simultaneously keep @xmath25 inside the closed constraint set @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , the demon aims to ensure that the system states never reach @xmath28 and instead leave @xmath29 quickly . as  @xcite , we will refer the game to as the time - optimal approach - evasion ( to - ae , for short ) differential game is an example of the pursuit - evasion game . the games of interest can also be applied to robust optimal control where two players act on a single dynamic system . ] .",
    "the aforementioned conflicting objectives are formalized as follows .",
    "define by @xmath30 the first time when the trajectory @xmath31 hits @xmath28 while staying in @xmath29 before @xmath30 .",

    "we need the notion of nonanticipating or causal strategy in the sense of varaiya , roxin , elloitt and kalton in  @xcite .",

    "each curve corresponds to the average of a number of trials for a specific algorithm .",
    "the trial number of @xmath2 is @xmath81 . due to their relatively slow convergence",
    ", we only simulate the multi - grid method and @xmath1 algorithm for @xmath82 and @xmath83 times , respectively .",
    "the standard deviations of each algorithm is also shown in figure  [ fig : hc - comparison - error ] . in order to compute the approximation errors",
    ", we use the solution computed by a @xmath84 grid as the benchmark .",
    "it is noted that logarithmic scaling is used in the figure .",
    "figure  [ fig : hc - comparison - error ] clearly shows that the convergence of @xmath1 is faster than that of the multi - grid method , and @xmath2 is significantly faster than @xmath1 . in figure",
    "[ fig : hc - chart ] , we compare the average computation times three algorithms take to reach the approximation errors of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . figure  [ fig : hc - chart ] confirms the superior convergence rates of @xmath1 and @xmath2 over that of the multi - grid method . the evolution of the @xmath1 value function approximation for the fence escape game is shown in figure  [ fig : hc - isaddle - star - incremental ] .     +     secondly , we examine the performance of @xmath2 when the pursuer uses @xmath2 and the evader uses a fixed - grid approximation based on a @xmath89 grid iterated to convergence .",
    "figure  [ fig : hc - realgame ] shows the outcome of the game from initial states on a @xmath89 grid . for practical purposes , a maximum time approximately @xmath83 times larger than a reasonable capture time was used for the duration of the simulated games , with the outcome of games reaching this threshold referred to as `` timeout '' .",
    "qualitatively , games so terminating generally exhibit oscillatory behaviour , with the pursuer attempting to capture the evader , who narrowly escapes , the pursuer turning around to try again , the evader escaping again , and so on .",
    "thus , while some games labeled as timeout may in fact have terminated at some later time , it is thought that most will behave this way and so timeout can be thought of also in this sense as a stalemate .",
    "these tests demonstrate the performance of @xmath2 against a fixed grid opponent improving as the number of points increases , to the point where the evader is captured from nearly all states where capture is possible , and some states from which escape is possible .",
    "the latter case is not entirely obvious in the figures , mostly due to the fact that the 50x50 fixed grid still yields a fairly good approximation .",
    "importantly , these results also show the benefit of using @xmath2 in an online setting - early on , when few points are used , games starting from many states terminate in timeout , however , this outcome is not truly a loss for the pursuer , but allows more time to incrementally improve the policy . as the policy is improved , the pursuer is better able to capture the evader , and states which initially would have resulted in timeout result in capture . in other words , so long as the pursuer is able to prevent the evader from escaping , the policy can be improved , and capture is inevitable .",
    "all simulation tests were written in java version 1.7.0 and run on a machine running windows 7 , with 8 gb ram and an intel(r ) core(tm ) i7 processor running at 2.80 ghz .",
    "for all simulation tests described in this document , the optimal feedback control policies were determined based on the value function approximation , for all the algorithms , by solving a single - step min - max problem over a discrete set of inputs , as in the value update .",
    "we have investigated two anytime computation algorithms , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , for the approach - evasion differential game .",
    "their asymptotic convergence properties have been formally analyzed . through a number of numerical simulations , we have demonstrated their anytime property and superior computational efficiency over the state of the art .",
