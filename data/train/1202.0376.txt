    "@xcite , the highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber ( pcf ) is identified as a promising candidate for developing the practical sources of photon pairs with low cost and compact size , owing to its advantages of controllable dispersion and excellent spatial mode purity  @xcite .    for the photon pairs generated by pumping the pcf with a pulsed laser , the length of pcf , usually from tens of centimeters to a few meters , is not only related to the brightness , but also related to the spectral factorability  @xcite .",

    "the curves connecting the data points are only for guiding the eyes . , width=283 ]    to exhibit the inhomogeneity of pcf more clearly , we cut the 1.9 m pcf into two segments , whose lengths are 1 m and 0.9 m ( see fig . [ setup](b ) ) , respectively . for each segments",
    ", we also record the single counts of spd2 by varying @xmath122 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra](b ) , the spectra of the two segments are about respectively responsible for the different parts of the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra](a ) . by comparing the overlapped spectral region between each segment and the original 1.9 m pcf",
    ", one sees that for the 1 m pcf , the main peak of spectrum experiences an obvious rising ( see figs .",
    "[ signal - spectra](a ) and [ signal - spectra](b ) ) .",
    "we think this is because the transmission efficiency @xmath123 in the pcf is rather low in the wavelength range of about 1.4 @xmath124 m , as evidenced by the inset in fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra](c ) .    fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra ] ( b ) not only clarify the dispersion along the original 1.9 m pcf is non - uniform , but also indicate that the two segments of pcfs are inhomogeneous . to better understand the inhomogeneity of pcf",
    ", we further cut the 0.9 m pcf into two subsegments ( see fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) ) , whose lengths are 0.3 m and 0.6 m , respectively .",
    "again , for each subsegment , we measure the single counts of spd2 by varying @xmath122 . as shown in the main plot of fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra](c ) , the spectral patterns of the two subsegments are dramatically different from each other , and the spectrum of their direct combination is distinct from that of the 0.9 m pcf .",
    "moreover , the spectra in fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra](c ) indicate that the two subsegments are also inhomogeneous .",
    "we note that in carrying out the above experiments , we have also measured the spectra of signal photons produced from different segments of the 1.9 m pcf by launching the pump along the slow axis of the pcf .",
    "the spectral pattern of each segment is very similar to that obtained by propagating the pump along the fast axis , except a upshift in wavelength of about 2 nm .",
    "therefore , the birefringence of the pcf does not contribute to the modulated spectra , and the data in figs .",
    "[ signal - spectra](a)-[signal - spectra](c ) reflects how the spectra of phase matching function are affected by the random distribution of dispersion in inhomogeneous pcf . although the dispersion of each segment cutting from 1.9 m pcf is non - uniform , which is different from that in the model shown in fig . [ model ] , the analysis in sec .",
    "ii qualitatively explains the experimental results .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the signal spectrum of the original 1.9 m pcf seems like a direct summation of that of the two pcfs with lengths of 0.9 m and 1 m , respectively .",
    "one may think the phenomena might be an indication of the effective interaction length of sfwm owing to the walk - off between the signal and pump fields  @xcite .",
    "however , our investigation shows that the signal and idler photons of a pair should be considered as a whole , and no walk - off between the photon pairs and pump are observed  @xcite . according to the analysis in sec .",
    "ii b , we think the reason responsible for the data in figs .",
    "[ signal - spectra](a ) and [ signal - spectra](b ) is that the overlapped region between the signal spectra of the 0.9 m and 1 m segments is relatively small .",
    "if the overlapped region between the two segments is greatly increased , the signal spectrum of the inhomogeneous pcf would be different from a direct combination of that of each segment . to further verify this point",
    ", we rejoin the 1 m and 0.3 m pcfs by placing the two fiber ends in intimate contact .",
    "the transmission loss of the junction is @xmath1191 db and the axes of the two pcfs are not accurately aligned due to the technical limitation . after launching the pump along the fast axis of the 1 m pcf , we measure the single counts of signal photons of the rejoined pcf when @xmath122 is varied . as shown in fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra](d ) , despite the imperfect connection , one sees that the influence of the 0.3 m pcf on the rejoined 1.3 m pcf is still observable . comparing with the spectrum for 1 m pcf in fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra ] ( b ) , we find that the heights of the two small peaks setting in the left side of the highest peak at about 1417 nm are depressed , and the small peak sitting in the right side of the highest peak is missing .",
    "the results show that direct combination of the signal spectra of the 0.3 m and 1 m pcfs is different from the spectral pattern of the rejoined pcf .    finally , we study the influence of inhomogeneity on the factorability of photon pairs by measuring @xmath86 of the individual signal field . to do so ,",
    "we perform the measurement by exploiting the setup in fig .",
    "[ setup](c ) . in the measurement",
    ", the condition @xmath51 still holds .",
    "the nbf is replaced with a long pass filter ( lpf ) with a cutoff wavelength of 1200 nm , and the fwhm in the signal band is @xmath119 40 nm , which is exclusively provided by the prism . after passing the signal field through a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs )",
    ", the outputs of bs are fed into the spd2 and spd3 ( id200 ) , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath86 is the ratio between the measured coincidence and accidental coincidence rates of spd2 and spd3  @xcite . for the pcfs with length of 1 m and 0.6 m ,",
    "the measured @xmath86 are @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "since the bandwidths of signal photons in both pcfs are much smaller than 40 nm , the measurement can be viewed as a filter free case . moreover , comparing the results of @xmath86 with the corresponding spectra the pcfs in fig .",
    "[ signal - spectra ] , one sees that the experimental results are consistent with our theoretical analysis .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the spectral properties of the photon pairs generated from sfwm in inhomogeneous pcfs from the theoretical and experimental aspects .",
    "the theoretical model shows that the photon pairs born in different place of the inhomogeneous pcf are coherently superposed , and a modulation in the broadened spectrum of phase matching function will appear , which prevents the realization of spectral factorable photon pairs .",
    "in particular , the inhomogeneity induced modulation can be examined by measuring the spectrum of individual signal or idler field when the agvm condition is approximately fulfilled .",
    "the experiment is performed by tailoring the spectrum of pump to ensure the agvm condition is approximately satisfied .",
    "the observed spectra of individual signal photons , which are produced from different segments of the pcf , demonstrate the 1.9 m pcf and its segments with length down to 0.3 m are inhomogeneous , and the experimental results qualitatively agree with the theoretical predictions .",
    "moreover , our results indicate that in the sense of generating spectral factorable photon pairs , the problem of lacking the homogeneous pcf with a longer length might be overcome in some extent by selecting and splicing the shorter pcfs having almost identical dispersion properties .",
    "our investigations are not only useful for fiber based quantum state engineering , but also provide a dependable method to test the inhomogeneity of pcf . although it has been demonstrated that the nonuniform dispersion property in optical fibers can be characterized by using parametric amplification , our method is different from those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is because ( i ) instead of using the amplified signal wave via continuous wave pumped four wave mixing in high gain regime , we exploit the pulse pumped sfwm in the low gain regime ; and ( ii ) in contrast to characterize the fiber with length in the order of hundreds meters or kilometers , we can examine the inhomogeneity of pcf with length less than 1 m."
