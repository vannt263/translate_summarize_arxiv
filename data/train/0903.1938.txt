    "as is well known , stirring by the velocity field greatly enhances the amount of irreversible mixing due to molecular diffusion in turbulent stratified fluid flows , as compared with the laminar case .",
    "a rigorous proof of this result exists for thermally - driven boussinesq fluids for which boundary conditions are either of no - flux or fixed temperature . in that case , it is possible to show that @xmath17 i.e. , the ratio of the entropy production ( in the boussinesq limit ) of the stirred state over that of the corresponding purely conductive non - stirred state is always greater than unity , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the temperature of the stirred and conductive states respectively , the proof being originally due to @xcite , and re - derived by @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath20 was introduced by @xcite as a measure of the strength of the circulation driven by surface buoyancy fluxes .",
    "however , because @xmath20 is analogous to an average cox number ( the local turbulent effective diffusivity normalised by the background diffusivity ) e.g.  @xcite , it is also representative of the amount of turbulent diapycnal mixing taking place in the fluid .",
    "reversible stirring and irreversible mixing , e.g. , see @xcite , occur in relation with physically distinct types of forces at work in the fluid .",
    "stirring works against buoyancy forces by lifting and pulling relatively heavier and lighter parcels respectively , thus causing a reversible conversion between kinetic energy @xmath21 and available potential energy @xmath22 . mixing , on the other hand , is the byproduct of the work done by the generalised thermodynamic forces associated with molecular viscous and diffusive processes that relax the system toward thermodynamic equilibrium , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "thus , stirring enhances the work rate done by the viscous stress against the velocity field , resulting in enhanced dissipation of @xmath3 into internal energy @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , stirring also enhances the thermal entropy production rate associated with the heat transfer imposed by the second law of thermodynamics , which results in a diathermal effective diffusive heat flux that is increased by the ratio @xmath24 ( another measure of the cox number ) , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to the `` turbulent '' and `` laminar '' area of a given isothermal surface , see @xcite and @xcite . in the laminar regime ,",
    "the generalised thermodynamic forces associated with molecular diffusion are known to cause the conversion of @xmath2 into background gravitational potential energy @xmath27 . from a thermodynamic viewpoint",
    ", it would be natural to expect the stirring to enhance the @xmath5 conversion , but in fact , the existing literature usually accounts for the observed turbulent increase in @xmath0 as the result of a `` new '' energy conversion irreversibly converting @xmath1 into @xmath0 .",
    "clarifying this controversial issue is a key objective of this paper .",
    "the most rigorous existing theoretical framework to understand the interactions between the different forces at work in a turbulent stratified fluid is probably the available potential energy framework introduced by @xcite , for being the only one so far that rigourously separates reversible effects due to stirring from the irreversible effects due to mixing ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as originally proposed by @xcite , such a framework separates the potential energy @xmath28 ( i.e. , the sum of the gravitational potential energy @xmath29 and internal energy @xmath2 ) into its available @xmath30 and non - available @xmath31 components , with the ie component being neglected for a boussinesq fluid , the case considered by @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of such a decomposition stems from the fact that the background reference state is by construction only affected by diabatic and/or irreversible processes , so that understanding how the reference state evolves provides insight into how much mixing takes place in the fluid .    in the case of",
    "a freely - decaying turbulent boussinesq stratified fluid with an equation of state linear in temperature , referred to as the l - boussinesq model thereafter , @xcite show that the evolution equations for @xmath3 , @xmath32 , and @xmath0 take the form : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the so - called `` buoyancy flux '' measuring the reversible conversion between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , @xmath37 is the diffusive dissipation of @xmath1 , which is related to the dissipation of temperature variance @xmath38 , e.g.  @xcite , while @xmath39 is the rate of change in @xmath0 induced by molecular diffusion , which is commonly decomposed into a laminar @xmath40 and turbulent @xmath41 contribution .",
    "all these terms are explicitly defined in appendix a for the l - boussinesq model , as well for a boussinesq fluid whose thermal expansion increases with temperature , called the nl - boussinesq model .",
    "appendix b further generalises the corresponding expressions for the fully compressible navier - stokes equations ( cnse thereafter ) with an arbitrary nonlinear equation of state ( depending on pressure and temperature only though ) .    of particular interest in turbulent mixing studies",
    "is the behaviour of @xmath41  the turbulent rate of increase in @xmath0  which so far has been mostly discussed in the context of the l - boussinesq model , for which an important result is : @xmath42 which states the equality between the @xmath1 dissipation rate and @xmath41 .",
    "this result is important , because from the known properties of @xmath37 , it makes it clear that enhanced diapycnal mixing rates fundamentally require : 1 ) finite values of @xmath1 , since @xmath43 when @xmath44 ; 2 ) an @xmath1 cascade transferring the spectral energy of the temperature ( density ) field to the small scales at which molecular diffusion is the most efficient at smoothing out temperature gradients .",
    "the discussion of the @xmath1 cascade , which is closely related to that of the temperature variance , has an extensive literature related to explaining the @xmath45 spectra in the so - called buoyancy subrange , both in the atmosphere , e.g.  @xcite and in the oceans , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "it is useful to separate turbulent mixing events into two main archetypal categories , corresponding to the two cases where @xmath57 is initially entirely either in @xmath3 or @xmath1 form .",
    "these two cases are treated separately , before providing a synthesis addressing the general case .    at a fundamental level , quantifying the mixing efficiency of a turbulent mixing event requires two numbers , one to measure how much of @xmath57 is viscously dissipated , the other to measure how much of @xmath57 is dissipated by turbulent mixing . while everybody seems to agree that @xmath48 is the natural measure of viscous dissipation , it is the buoyancy flux @xmath58 , rather than @xmath37 , that has been historically thought to be the relevant measure of how much of @xmath57 is dissipated by turbulent mixing , since it is the term in eq .",

    "the first one is the so - called flux richardson number @xmath8 , defined by linden ( 1979 ) as : `` the fraction of the change in available kinetic energy which appears as the potential energy of the stratification '' , mathematically defined as : @xmath61 e.g. , osborn ( 1980 ) , and the second one is the so - called `` mixing efficiency '' : @xmath62 it is now recognised , however , that the buoyancy flux represents only an indirect measure of irreversible mixing , since it physically represents a reversible conversion between @xmath3 and @xmath1 , while furthermore appearing to be difficult to interpret empirically , e.g.  see @xcite and references therein .",
    "recognising this difficulty , @xcite and @xcite effectively suggested to replace @xmath63 by a more direct measure of irreversible mixing in the above definitions of @xmath8 and @xmath7 . since turbulent diapycnal mixing is often diagnosed empirically from measuring the net changes in @xmath0 over a mixing event , e.g.   @xcite , a natural choice is to use @xmath64 as a direct measure of irreversible mixing , which leads to : @xmath65 @xmath66 from a theoretical viewpoint , these definitions are justified from the fact that in the l - boussinesq model , the following equalities hold : @xmath67 as follows from eqs .",

    "so far , it seems fair to say that these two energy conversions have been regarded as essentially being one and the same , based on the exact equality @xmath103 occurring in the l - boussinesq model , suggesting that molecular diffusion irreversibly converts @xmath1 into @xmath0 , e.g.  @xcite .",

    "indeed , only a physical equality can define a physically valid energy conversion , as we hope the reader will agree . as shown in appendix b , however , which extends @xcite results to the cnse , the equality @xmath104 is found to be a serendipitous feature of the l - boussinesq model , which at best is only a good approximation , the general result being that the ratio @xmath105 usually lies within the interval @xmath106 for water or seawater , and that it strongly depends on the nonlinear character of the equation of state . whether there exists fluids allowing for @xmath107 is not known yet .",
    "an important result is that it appears to be perfectly possible for @xmath0 to _ decrease _ as the result of turbulent mixing , in contrast to what is often stated in the literature .",
    "this case , which corresponds to @xmath108 , was in fact previously identified and discussed by the late nick fofonoff in a series of little known papers , see @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the case @xmath109 shall be subsequently referred to as the _ fofonoff regime _ , while the more commonly studied case for which @xmath110 shall be referred to as the _ classical regime_.    the lack of physical equality between @xmath37 and @xmath41 makes @xcite s interpretation very unlikely , and gives strong credence to the idea that @xmath41 actually correspond to a stirring - enhanced @xmath5 conversion rate .",
    "if so , what about @xmath37 ? in order to shed light on the issue of @xmath1 dissipation , it is useful to recall some well known properties of thermodynamic transformations associated with the following problem : assuming that the potential energy @xmath111 of a stratified fluid increases by @xmath112 , how is @xmath112 split between @xmath113 and @xmath114 ? here , standard thermodynamics tells us that the answer depends on whether @xmath112 is added reversibly or irreversibly to @xmath28 .",

    "as shown in appendix b , the answer to the above question is found to be negative , because it turns out that the kind of @xmath2 which @xmath1 is dissipated into appears to be different from the kind of @xmath2 being converted into @xmath0 .",

    "although mw98 s arguments have been echoed favourably within the ocean community , e.g.   @xcite , it remains unclear why the surface buoyancy fluxes should not be important in stirring and driving the oceans , given that the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes , as measured by the @xmath1 production rate , was previously estimated by @xcite to be @xmath142 and hence comparable in importance to the work rate done by the mechanical forcing . in their paper , mw98 rather summarily dismissed @xcite s results by contending that the so - called @xcite s `` theorem '' requires that @xmath15 be negligible , and hence that the buoyancy forcing can not produce any significant work in the oceans , but given the highly controversial nature of @xcite s paper in the physical oceanography community , and its apparent refutation by @xcite , it would seem important to have a more solid physical basis to make any definitive statements about @xmath15 .",

    "alternatively , one could also perhaps question the assumption that the oceans are truly in a steady state .",
    "in this paper , we extended @xcite ape framework to the fully compressible navier - stokes equations , with the aims of : 1 ) clarifying the nature of the energy conversion taking place in turbulent stratified fluids ; 2 ) clarifying the role of the surface buoyancy fluxes in @xcite s constraint on the mechanical sources of stirring required to sustain diapycnal mixing in the oceans .",
    "the most important results are that the well - known turbulent increase in background @xmath0 , commonly thought to occur at the expense of the diffusively dissipated @xmath1 , actually occurs at the expense of ( the exergy part of ) @xmath2 . on the other hand , the @xmath1 dissipated by molecular diffusion is found to be dissipated into ( the dead part of ) @xmath2 , i.e. , the same kind of @xmath2 the viscously dissipated @xmath3 is converted into , not into @xmath0 .",
    "turbulent stirring , therefore , should not be viewed as introducing a new form of mechanical - to - mechanical @xmath4 conversion , but simply as enhancing the existing @xmath5 conversion rate , in addition to enhancing the viscous dissipation rate of @xmath3 , as well as the diffusive entropy production and @xmath1 dissipation rates .",
    "these results are important , for they significantly alter the current understanding about the nature of turbulent diapycnal mixing and its links with the dissipation of mechanical energy and turbulent increase of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the possibility that @xmath0 may decrease as a result of turbulent mixing , not necessarily increase as is commonly thought , is to be emphasised .",
    "moreover , the fact that the turbulent increase of @xmath0 is associated with an enhanced @xmath5 conversion physically implies that compressible effects must be considerably larger than previously thought , raising fundamental questions about the possible limitations of the widely used incompressible assumption in the modelling of fluid flows at low mach numbers , which further work should aim at elucidating .",
    "finally , the present results also have implications for the way one should quantify the efficiency of mixing in turbulent stratified fluids , with new definitions for the mixing efficiency ( or more accurately dissipations ratio ) @xmath7 and flux richardson number @xmath8 being proposed in the introduction , where they are also compared with existing definitions .",
    "a significant achievement of the extended ape framework is to allow for a more rigorous and general re - derivation of mw98 s result ( our eq .",

    "the main new result here is the finding that the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes @xmath15 should be numerically comparable to @xmath11 .",
    "this is important , because while @xmath11 is currently widely agreed to be large @xmath296 , @xmath15 has been widely thought to be negligible on the basis of mw98 s argument that this is required by sandstrom s `` theorem '' .",
    "the result therefore demonstrates that @xmath15 is as important as the mechanical forcing in driving and stirring the oceans , in agreement with @xcite s previous conclusions .",
    "the two main consequences are that : 1 ) there is no reason to reject the idea that the oceans are a heat engine , and that the north - south heat transport is mostly the result of the buoyancy forcing , as was usually thought to be the case prior to mw98 s study , e.g.  @xcite ; 2 ) the overall value of @xmath7 in the oceans is likely to be significantly larger than the value of @xmath16 currently used , as seems to be required by the large magnitude of @xmath15 , given that buoyancy - driven turbulent mixing has a significantly higher @xmath7 than mechanically - driven turbulent mixing in general . note that increasing @xmath7 decreases the requirement on the mechanical sources of stirring , thereby providing a natural way to remove the apparent paradoxical result of a shortfall in the mechanical stirring energy that arises when @xmath16 is used in eq .",
    "( [ general_constraint ] ) for @xmath13 .",
    "the extended ape framework may also be used to revisit the assumed implications of @xcite s anti - turbulence `` theorem '' , the main conclusion being that horizontal convection may in fact support elevated values of diapycnal mixing , in contrast to what is usually assumed .",
    "it seems important to stress , however , that even if one could prove that surface buoyancy fluxes could sustain on their own diapycnal mixing rates as large as observed , it would not prove that the actual buoyancy - driven component of the ocean circulation is not mechanically - controlled .",
    "indeed , it is essential to recognise that both @xmath10 and @xmath15 do not depend only on the external forcing parameters , but also strongly depend on the actual ocean circulation and stratification , which necessarily implies a mechanical control of the buoyancy - driven circulation and vice versa . in other words , even though the present study disagrees with mw98 s contention that surface buoyancy fluxes do not work or stir the oceans , there should be little doubt that even if the moc is expected to be primarily buoyancy - driven , it is also mechanically controlled in ways that are not fully understood . in this respect , therefore , mw98 deserves credit for challenging the idea that the behaviour of the buoyancy - driven circulation can be understood independently of its link with the mechanical forcing .    an important challenge",
    "ahead will be to extend the present framework to deal with an equation of state also depending on salinity , which gives rise to the possibility of double - diffusion effects , and storing energy in chemical form .",
    "such extensions are needed to better connect the present results to many laboratory experiments based on the use of compositionally - stratified fluids , although the present evidence is that the use of a linear equation of state is probably accurate enough to describe the latter . to that end , many technical difficulties need to be overcome .",
    "indeed , salinity complicates the definition of @xcite s reference state to such an extent that it is not even clear that such a state can be uniquely defined , e.g.  @xcite , as may be the case in presence of humidity in the atmosphere , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a potentially important generalisation would also be to further decompose the internal energy in order to isolate the available acoustic energy considered by @xcite , which in the present paper is included as part of our definition of @xmath1 .",

    "<S> in this paper , @xcite s available potential energy ( ape ) framework is extended to the fully compressible navier - stokes equations , with the aims of : 1 ) clarifying the nature of the energy conversions taking place in turbulent thermally - stratified fluids ; 2 ) clarifying the role of surface buoyancy fluxes in @xcite s constraint on the mechanical energy sources of stirring required to maintain diapycnal mixing in the oceans . </S>",
    "<S> the new framework reveals that the observed turbulent rate of increase in the background gravitational potential energy @xmath0 , commonly thought to occur at the expenses of the diffusively dissipated @xmath1 , actually occurs at the expenses of internal energy , as in the laminar case . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 dissipated by molecular diffusion , on the other hand , is found to be converted into @xmath2 , similarly as the viscously dissipated kinetic energy @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> turbulent stirring , therefore , does not introduce a new @xmath4 mechanical - to - mechanical energy conversion , but simply enhances the existing @xmath5 conversion rate , in addition to enhancing the viscous dissipation and entropy production rates . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn implies that molecular diffusion contributes to the dissipation of the available mechanical energy @xmath6 , along with viscous dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> this result has important implications for the interpretation of the concepts of mixing efficiency @xmath7 and flux richardson number @xmath8 , for which new physically - based definitions are proposed and contrasted with previous definitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the new framework allows for a more rigorous and general re - derivation from first principles of @xcite s constraint also valid for a non - boussinesq ocean : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the work rate done by the mechanical forcing , @xmath11 is the rate of loss of @xmath0 due to high - latitude cooling , and @xmath12 a nonlinearity parameter such that @xmath13 for a linear equation of state ( as considered by @xcite ) , but @xmath14 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the most important result is that @xmath15 , the work rate done by the surface buoyancy fluxes , must be numerically as large as @xmath11 , and therefore as important as the mechanical forcing in stirring and driving the oceans . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the overall mixing efficiency of the oceans is likely to be larger than the value @xmath16 presently used , thereby possibly eliminating the apparent shortfall in mechanical stirring energy that results from using @xmath16 in the above formula . </S>"
