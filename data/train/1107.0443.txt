    "very recently , a series of charmonium - like resonances has successively been observed by various experimental collaborations , such as @xmath0@xcite , @xmath11@xcite , @xmath12@xcite , and several bottomoniun - like states were also discovered at the belle and babar energy ranges , such as @xmath13@xcite , @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is noted that there is almost no room in the ground state representations of @xmath16 to accommodate those newly observed resonances .",
    "not only their mass spectra , but also their behaviors of production and decay may hint if they are exotic states such as hybrids , molecular states , tetraquarks , or just radial and/or orbital excited charmonia .",
    "it would be an interesting task to determine their inner structures from both experimental and theoretical aspects . as a matter of fact , there are different interpretations for these resonances which are of different constituent compositions from the regular mesons , so that for clarifying its structure , all the interpretations should be studied one by one and then we can see if the predictions are in agreement with data . the most reasonable way is to calculate its mass and decay widths by assuming its structure in certain theoretical frameworks , then a comparison of the prediction with data would confirm or negate the assumption about the identity of the resonance",
    ".    among the newly observed resonances , @xmath0 which was found a while ago has caused special interests of experimentalists as well as theorists @xcite .",
    "some authors regard it as a molecular state@xcite , whereas other groups consider it as a tetraquark@xcite . instead",
    ", the recent data on @xmath17 may hint a possible assignment @xmath18 ( i.e. @xmath2 ) for @xmath0 which has inspired theoretical interests@xcite .",
    "the charmonia mass spectrum has been calculated in the potential model and the theoretical prediction for a @xmath18 charmonium is about @xmath19gev@xcite or @xmath20gev@xcite which is 30 - 60 mev lower than the measured value of @xmath0 .",
    "because of uncertainty existing in the calculation of the binding energies of excited states with the potential model such difference may not be too serious , but the difference might imply that our understanding on its assignment might be not completely correct . to determine its structure one needs more information from other sources , especially its decay modes .",
    "the belle and babar collaborations also reported their measurements on the radiative decays of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the data given by the babar collaboration @xcite are @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 the belle collaboration also reported their new result as @xmath24 and set an upper bound @xmath25 and @xmath26 because they found no evidence for @xmath27@xcite .",
    "the data from the two collaborations are consistent on @xmath28 but largely apart on @xmath27 .",
    "obviously the further measurement and theoretical study are badly needed .    in this work",
    "we investigate the radiative decays of @xmath0 which is supposed to be a @xmath18 charmonium in the light - front quark model .",
    "the results may help us to determine the structure of @xmath0 .",
    "the light - front quark model(lfqm ) is a relativistic model@xcite and in this model wave functions are manifestly lorentz invariant and expressed in terms of the fractions of internal momenta of the constituents which are independent of the total hadron momentum .",
    "this approach has been applied to study many processes and thoroughly discussed in literatures @xcite .",
    "generally the results obtained in this framework qualitatively coincide with the experimental observation on the concerned processes and while taking the error ranges into account ( both experimental and theoretical ) , they can be considered to quantitatively agree with the available data .    to evaluate the transition rate in the lfqm one needs to know the wave functions of the parent and daughter hadrons .",
    "the wavefunctions for the s - wave and p - wave were given in ref.@xcite and we studied the wavefunctions of the d - wave in ref.@xcite with which we are able to investigate the transitions involving s- , p- and d - wave mesons .",
    "then for obtaining the transition amplitude , one also needs calculate those form factors in terms of the effective lagrangian . in this work",
    "we will deduce the form factors for the radiative decay of @xmath29 in the covariant light - front quark model . with those formulas we calculate the rate of the radiative decays of @xmath0 which is supposed to be a pure @xmath2 meson .",
    "because of the so - called @xmath30 puzzle , namely the branching ratio of @xmath31 is extremely small while @xmath32 is one of the main decay modes of @xmath33 , it is suggested @xmath8 might not be a pure 2s state ( @xmath34 ) but a mixture of @xmath35 and @xmath36 states ( @xmath37 ) @xcite . this allegation has not been fully confirmed so far , even though it forms a reasonable interpretation for the @xmath30 puzzle and needs more theoretical and experimental tests indeed . in this work ,",
    "we consider the two possibilities and obtain the branching ratio of the decay @xmath38 with and without considering the mixing scenario respectively .    in this work after the introduction we derive the form factors for the radiative decay of @xmath39 in the covariant light - front approach in section ii .",
    "then in section iii we present our numerical results about the decay @xmath40 and @xmath27 .",
    "the section iv is devoted to discussions and our conclusion .",
    "in refs.@xcite the authors discussed how to calculate the transition matrix in the covariant light - front approach . following their strategy we formulate the matrix element for @xmath39 .",
    "the relative orbital angular momenta of @xmath2 and @xmath41 are @xmath42(d wave ) and @xmath43(s wave ) respectively .",
    "fist let us list the vertex functions for @xmath2@xcite and @xmath41@xcite states as @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 represents the @xmath41 state and @xmath46 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath18 state decaying into @xmath41 via a photon emission is written as    cc +    @xmath47{\\varepsilon'}^\\nu { \\varepsilon}^{\\alpha\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath48(\\slash\\!\\!\\!p'_1+m_1)\\gamma_\\mu(\\slash\\!\\!\\!p_1+m_1)\\}k_\\alpha k_\\beta,\\ ] ] @xmath49(\\slash\\!\\!\\!p_1+m_1)\\ } k_\\alpha k_\\beta,\\ ] ] @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the momentum @xmath54 is decomposed as ( @xmath55 ) in the light - front frame .",
    "one needs to integrate over @xmath56 by a contour integration@xcite .",
    "here we have set the relations among all relevant momenta as @xmath57 for fig ( a ) ; @xmath58 for fig ( b ) .",
    "then it is easy to find @xmath59 .",
    "the integration contour is closed in the upper plane of the complex @xmath56 for the first term in eq.(2 ) and in the lower plane for the second term .",
    "then the first term after the integration turns into @xmath60 where @xmath61[m_0'^2-(m_1+m_2)^2 ] } } { 12\\sqrt{5}m_0'^2\\beta'^2}\\phi'(ns).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the formula , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 in @xmath67 must be replaced by the appropriate quantities as discussed in ref.@xcite to include the contributions of the zero modes , for example @xmath68 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 being identical to @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the maximally transverse polarized state ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath67 changes into @xmath74 .",
    "more details about the derivation can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "after the replacement , @xmath74 is decomposed into @xmath75 with @xmath76 where @xmath77 are defined in the appendix .",
    "we define the form factors as following @xmath78 which will be numerically evaluated in next section .    with these form factors",
    "the amplitude is obtained as @xmath79{\\varepsilon}^\\nu{\\varepsilon}^{\\alpha\\beta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "with the formulas derived in section ii we can calculate the decay rates for @xmath82 in the light - front quark model .",
    "in fact the main task is to evaluate these form factor @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 at @xmath87 .",
    "we set @xmath88 gev following ref.@xcite at first and will discuss the dependence of our results on the choice in later part of the paper . then we need to fix the parameter @xmath89 in the wavefunction . generally in lfqm , we can fix the @xmath89 value by fitting the decay constant of a vector meson , thus in this work , we employ @xmath33 as the meson . the formula for calculating the decay constant of a vector meson",
    "was given in refs.@xcite : @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and other notations are collected in the appendix .",
    "using the data of @xmath92@xcite we extract the decay constant of @xmath33 : @xmath93 mev by which we fix the model parameter @xmath89 as @xmath94gev .",
    "the masses of @xmath0 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are chosen according to ref.@xcite .",
    "the numerical values of the form factors for @xmath95 are listed in tab .",
    "i. then we obtain @xmath96gev .",
    "the recent measurement sets only an upper bound on the total width of @xmath0 , so that we can not determine accurate branching ratios for the radiative decays , but only a bound which is listed in table [ tab : decay2 ] .",
    "theoretically , jia @xmath97@xcite studied the same transition within the pnrqcd framework where several phenomenological potentials were adopted , in their work the quantum number of @xmath0 was assigned as @xmath2 .",
    "they obtained @xmath98gev corresponding to different potential models which is in accordance with our result . for comparing theoretical results with the data we present the experimental data and theoretical prediction on the branching ratios @xmath99 in table [ tab : decay2 ] .",
    "the theoretical prediction of @xmath99 is slightly lower than the babar s data but quite close to the belle s data as long as we suppose @xmath0 as a @xmath2 state .",
    ".the form factors @xmath100 and @xmath86 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     now we turn to study the dependence of the theoretical predictions on @xmath101 for the three radiative decay modes .",
    "we let @xmath101 vary within a reasonable range from 1.3gev to 1.6gev and see how the widths of @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 change .",
    "indeed , it is noted that when we do so , we need to refit the @xmath89 parameter for different @xmath101 values using eq.([26 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of our results on @xmath101 is shown in fig.[mass ] .",
    "for example , when @xmath101 varies from 1.3gev to 1.6gev the theoretical prediction on @xmath104 changes from @xmath105 to @xmath106 .",
    "it is about 33% change , but the order of magnitude remains unchanged .",
    "the main goal of the work is to look for a criterion to determine the spin - orbit - identity of @xmath0 . as aforementioned ,",
    "the babar datum is several orders larger than the prediction , thus the theoretical uncertainty about @xmath101 does not influence the qualitative conclusion .",
    "determining the structures of the newly observed resonances is an interesting and difficult job , but the study is highly rewarding , because one can eventually identify if they are exotic states . retrospecting the history of searching glueballs at the charm energy range , the results are indeed discouraging .",
    "the new discovery offers an opportunity to recognize the hadrons which are not existing in the basic representations of @xmath107 , but as exotic states or even mixtures of glueball and other states . as a matter of fact",
    ", the charm energy range may be an abundant mine for such new exotic resonances .",
    "however , before one can identify any of them as an exotic state , he has to thoroughly investigate if it is an excited state of regular charmonium no matter it is radially or orbitally excited .",
    "@xmath0 is such an unknown resonance .",
    "many authors consider @xmath0 to be a molecular state or tetraquark , instead , it is also suggested that it may be a @xmath2 charmonium .    in this work",
    "we calculate the rates of the radiative decays of @xmath0 in the lfqm .",
    "we first deduce the amplitude and corresponding form factors in the amplitude of @xmath108 with the lfqm .",
    "then we suppose the @xmath0 is a pure @xmath2 charmonium and calculate the widths of @xmath40 and @xmath27 .",
    "we obtain @xmath109gev , @xmath110gev , @xmath111gev .    our theoretical predictions on @xmath112",
    "is obviously inconsistent with the data of the babar collaboration , but that on @xmath113 is consistent with data within the error tolerance .    as a matter of the fact ,",
    "the transition matrix element eventually depends on an overlapping integral of the wavefunctions of the initial and final hadrons .",
    "thus the node structure of the wavefunctions is extremely important .",
    "generally , the state with the principal quantum number @xmath114 possesses @xmath115 nodes , thus the overlapping integral between @xmath0 which is supposed to be an orbital excited state with @xmath116 does not possess a node , and neither @xmath117 , but @xmath34 does have a node .",
    "therefore , the integrand in the overlapping integration of @xmath0 and @xmath118 is always positive , instead , in the overlapping integration between wavefunctions of @xmath0 and @xmath34 , the integrand is positive on the left side of the node of the 2s state and negative on the right side of the node",
    ". thus a cancellation effect exists .",
    "therefore by a common sense , the transition @xmath119 is suppressed and @xmath120 should be smaller than @xmath121 . when the @xmath10 mixing for @xmath8",
    "is considered , the overlapping integration is decomposed into two integrations as @xmath122\\ ] ] where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 are the radial parts of the wavefunctions for @xmath34 , @xmath126 which are the ingredients in @xmath8 , and @xmath0 , @xmath127 is the mixing angle of @xmath35 and @xmath36 states in @xmath8 .",
    "there is a node in @xmath123 , but not in @xmath124 , so the first overlapping integration is suppressed as discussed before , but not for the second one .",
    "therefore , the predicted branching ratio is enhanced in comparison with the pure @xmath35 state assignment for @xmath8 .",
    "the data of the babar and belle collaborations on @xmath128 are obviously different , so that more accurate measurements are needed .",
    "our conclusion is that if the branching ratio of @xmath128 is indeed as large as the babar group measured , the @xmath2 charmonium assignment of @xmath0 should be ruled out .",
