    "the study of classical magnetization dynamics of fine ferromagnetic particles and thin films is of great interest in connection with the rapid progress of nanotechnologies and high - density magnetic recording .",
    "the most important research problems in this field include : ( a ) the problem of magnetization reversal from the former equilibrium direction to a new one under an applied reversal magnetic field , ( b ) magnetization escape over a barrier from one equilibrium direction to another one under thermal agitation , and ( c ) the effect of magnetization thermal fluctuations on the noise characteristics of magnetoresistive devices .",
    "all these problems depend on relaxation properties of the system , i.e. , detailed mechanisms of magnetization interaction with other degrees of freedom ( spin waves , elastic vibrations , conduction electrons , impurities , etc . ) of material .",
    "previously substantial effort has been focused on the study of mostly phenomenological magnetization relaxation ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze linear magnetization dynamics in the presence of a thermal bath for two general classes of microscopic damping mechanisms .",
    "this analysis will be restricted to low - level excitations where the magnetization remains close to equilibrium .",
    "recently , magnetization relaxation by direct coupling processes have been analyzed for the case of a general anisotropic magnetic system @xcite .",
    "the resulting stochastic differential equation obtained was in the form of a simple damped harmonic oscillator driven by a random thermal fluctuating field .",
    "the coordinate system of this oscillator ( or , normal mode ) reflected the magnetic anisotropy of the system .",
    "although specific damping mechanisms were not analyzed , the damping parameter was equivalent to the relaxation time .",
    "transformation back to magnetization variables yielded macroscopic dynamics where the damping term reflected the system symmetry in a tensor form @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    here",
    "this analysis is expanded to examine generally both direct and indirect mechanisms for coupling to a thermal bath . in all cases a stochastic differential equation in the form of a damped harmonic oscillator with random forces is obtained ( and the corresponding tensor form of damping , as well ) . in addition , two specific relaxation mechanisms are examined in detail : the direct process of magnon - electron confluence and the indirect process of ` slow - relaxing ' impurity .",
    "it is shown that these two processes in combination can explain experimental measurements of ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) linewidth in permalloy thin films . using reasonable estimates for the parameters associated with these mechanisms , very good fitting",
    "is obtained to the linewidth dependencies on temperature , frequency and film thickness .",
    "a phenomenological tool to study magnetization relaxation , which has had widespread use , is the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite or , its modification with gilbert damping @xcite .",
    "these ( llg ) equations conserve the absolute value of the magnetization ( @xmath0 ) in a single domain .",
    "they are relatively simple and therefore have been utilized for various calculations and micromagnetic simulations . in particular , these equations have been used to analyze the frequency dependence of fmr linewidth measurements in permalloy films ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "although , this data can be fit using the llg equations ( with a constant , phenomenological damping @xmath1 ) , this fact can not be considered as an experimental verification for validity of the general nature of the llg approach .",
    "as we show in detail , the general tensor form of the macroscopic equation reduces to the llg form only for axially symmetric systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the sec .",
    "ii we formulate the basic gyromagnetic motion in a rotating frame and demonstrate that gyromagnetic magnetization dynamics is equivalent to the motion of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "physics of a damped oscillator by direct coupling to a thermal bath is reviewed and expanded in sec .",

    "iv the general mechanism of indirect coupling is analyzed .",
    "an overview of magnetization dynamics with a brief comparison to the phenomenological llg form is given in sec .",
    "v. experimental fmr data for nife films are analyzed in sec .",
    "it is shown that relaxation processes due to magnetization interactions with slow - relaxing impurities and conduction electrons fit  the data well . a discussion in given at the end of the paper .",
    "let us consider small - amplitude magnetization motions of a single - domain ferromagnetic particle in the vicinity of equilibrium state @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the unit vector in the equilibrium direction and @xmath4 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "the magnetization rotation around effective field in this case , in general , is elliptical and the magnetic energy can be represented as a quadratic form ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) :    @xmath5    here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the unit orthogonal vectors in the plane perpendicular to the equilibrium direction . @xmath8 and @xmath9  are positive fields , which include both microscopic and shape anisotropies and the external magnetic field and @xmath10 is the particle volume ( see appendix i for an example ) .",
    "we begin with a common normal mode approach ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) , where the small oscillations of the transverse magnetization coordinates are first transformed to `` rotating '' complex variables by a linearized holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite : @xmath11 the magnetic energy ( [ energy ] ) now can be rewritten in the quadratic form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this classical transformation yields a form , common to quantum mechanics , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to creation and annihilation operators so that in ( [ quadform ] ) the term @xmath17 .",
    "note that for an isotropic system where @xmath18 , the term @xmath19  vanishes .",
    "the dynamic precession equations are given by    @xmath20    the mixed terms in ( [ eq - a ] ) can be eliminated by the linear canonical transformation : @xmath21 the magnetization components in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be expressed as    @xmath24    with this transformation the energy in terms of the normal mode coordinates is simply : @xmath25 where    @xmath26    is the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) frequency .",
    "the dynamic equations in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are now independent :    @xmath27    in order to derive a damped motion for this oscillator it is necessary to consider the interaction with a thermal bath .",
    "linear relaxation can be most simply described in the thermal bath approximation which represents coupling to a reservoir in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the thermal bath model has the following restriction : the interaction with the thermal bath is assumed to be weak .",
    "thus , dynamics of a single - domain ferromagnetic particle in the zeroth ( no thermal bath ) approximation represents the gyromagnetic rotation of magnetization around an effective field .",
    "this means that the symmetry of the gyromagnetic motion is dominant in the system and imposes some restrictions for damping and fluctuations .",
    "mathematical methods for a dynamic system interacting with a thermal bath have been developed in detail in quantum optics ( see , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",

    "the last term , if transformed back to the magnetization variables , can be represented as a scalar product @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an effective field from the thermal bath .    applying the transformation ( [ canonic ] ) ,",
    "we can write the dynamic equations for @xmath22  and @xmath30  as    @xmath34    here @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the terms @xmath37 in ( [ eqc ] ) and @xmath38 in ( [ eqb ] ) vanish as fast oscillating terms ( they describe rotations in the complex plane in the opposite direction to @xmath22 and @xmath30 , respectively ) and therefore can be omitted ( see , @xcite for details ) .",
    "a solution of ( [ eqb ] ) is :    @xmath39    substituting ( [ eqbsol ] ) into ( [ eqc ] ) , yields the integro - differential equation for @xmath40 :    @xmath41    here    @xmath42    describes a noise : @xmath43 are random ( and in thermal equilibrium ) .",
    "a solution of ( [ slow ] ) can be represented as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a `` slow '' variable . neglecting the memory for the slow variable ( @xmath46 ) , we can rewrite eq.([slow ] ) as :    @xmath47    for a long time @xmath48 one can put the upper integral limit at @xmath49 and use the formula :",
    "@xmath50    where @xmath51 is the dirac delta function and @xmath52 is the principal value of the integral .",

    "only the case of linear relaxation has been considered when the deviations of magnetization from equilibrium are relatively small .",
    "we have shown for two broad classes of relaxation mechanisms that dynamic relaxation may be expressed in terms of a damped harmonic oscillator equation driven by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the coordinates of the harmonic oscillator reflect a transformation of the transverse magnetization coordinates to circular motion .",
    "the transformation directly reflects the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the relaxation time or damping parameter contains details of the microscopic relaxation mechanisms and also , in general , information , via the transformation , about the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "it is important to note that by anisotropy we do not mean the for of the interaction with the thermal bath . here",
    "the anisotropy that yields a tensor form is macroscopic and arises , for example , from the sample shape ( e.g. , a thin film ) or the crystalline symmetry",
    ".    specific mechanisms of slow relaxing impurities and magnon - electron coupling were analyzed .",
    "it was shown that a sum of these two effects explains very well fmr field swept linewidth measurements versus temperature , frequency and film thickness .",
    "the fitting parameters agree well with previous estimates .",
    "transformation of the harmonic oscillator back to magnetization components results in a macroscopic form that is different from that of llg . the damping term ,",
    "although proportional to the relaxation time or damping parameter , depends on the magnetization and effective field through a tensor , whose components reflect the magnetic anisotropy . llg results only for the case of uniaxial system anisotropy about equilibrium . the llg equations for a fixed damping parameter @xmath1 do show a linear frequency dependence of the linewidth , in agreement with data . however .",
    "this is just an artifact : the llg damping can not be derived in terms of a microscopic relaxation rate .    in @xcite and",
    "earlier in @xcite it was shown that a magnetic system capable of non - uniform excitations about ( a possibly ) non - uniform equilibrium also resulted in damped harmonic oscillators . in this general case",
    "the eigenmodes of the general gyromagnetic motion tensor ( for a discretized system ) yield independent harmonic oscillators with corresponding resonance frequencies , relaxation rates and stochastic thermal energy .",
    "examples were given for a thin film sensor in a gmr transducer and in @xcite experimental fitting showed a better agreement than with simply adding energy to each discretized computation cell and applying llg with random fields to each cell .",
    "note that the dynamic normal mode approach with phenomenologically introduced damping  ( as a small imaginary addition to the frequency ) has been successfully used in the theory of parametrically excited spin waves ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "we have examined microscopic magnetization dynamics for two broad classes of interactions with a thermal bath .",
