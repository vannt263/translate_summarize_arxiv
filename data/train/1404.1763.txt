    "collective flow is one of the earliest proposed observables to measure the properties of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and densities created in ultra - relativistic collisions of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "the interaction strength of the whole system is reflected by common trends in the behaviour of particles coming from a nuclear collision .",
    "collective behaviour of the produced particles in a heavy ion collision is manifested for example as radial flow , a common velocity of different particle species that can be explained by a fireball with a certain temperature and collective velocity , one of the first pieces of evidence that a new state of matter , an equilibrated quark gluon plasma , is formed .",
    "this manuscript is focussed on anisotropic collective flow , which can be quantified by a fourier expansion in momentum space in the azimuthal direction in the transverse plane .",
    "the most prominent of these fourier coefficients is the second one the so called elliptic flow @xmath0 @xcite . in a non - central heavy ion collision",
    "the overlap region between the two nuclei is not spherically symmetric , but exhibits an ellipsoidal deformation .",
    "conventionally the impact parameter direction is defined to be the x - direction which corresponds to the shorter axis of the ellipse .",
    "if all particles would be produced with an isotropic cross section independently of each other the resulting distribution in momentum space would be rotationally symmetric .",
    "but if the hot and dense nuclear matter interacts collectively the coordinate space asymmetry is translated to a momentum space asymmetry and can be measured as anisotropic flow . therefore , collective anisotropic flow provides crucial information about the transport properties of strongly interacting matter at high temperatures and densities .",
    "even if the particles are non - uniformly distributed in coordinate space , a rather strong interaction between the particles is needed to transfer the geometrical granularity to observable structures in momentum space , e.g. higher moments of the fourier decomposition .    in 2005 , 5 years after the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) was turned on , the announcement that the quark gluon plasma has been found and behaves like an almost perfect liquid was mainly based on the observation of jet quenching and high elliptic flow @xcite .",
    "the agreement between elliptic flow measurements and hydrodynamic predictions was key to this conclusion @xcite and has been confirmed by viscous hydrodynamic calculations later on@xcite .",
    "already in the early days of the success of ideal hydrodynamic calculations at rhic , it became clear that a sudden transition from a strongly coupled system with vanishing mean free path to free streaming particles on a cooper - frye transition surface is not sufficient .",
    "therefore , hybrid approaches were proposed that combine the advantages of hydrodynamics with the ones from hadronic transport @xcite",
    ". a schematic overview of the space - time evolution of a heavy ion reaction within a hybrid approach is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sketch_hic ] . in the later stages of the reaction the particle abundancies",
    "are fixed first and then the kinetic freeze - out occurs . also , different particle species decouple successively from the fireball according to their hadronic cross sections .",
    "all these effects can be accommodated in so called hybrid approaches that match a hydrodynamic evolution to a hadronic cascade .    within the last  15 years",
    "hybrid approaches have been proven to be very successful in describing global features of heavy ion collisions at rhic and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "one can even say , that combined models applying ( viscous ) hydrodynamics for the hot and dense stage and hadronic transport for the later dilute stages of the reaction have been established as the standard model for the dynamical description of high energy heavy ion collisions . after the realization that event - by - event fluctuations are crucial and a wealth of anisotropic flow and correlation observations by the experimental collaborations is becoming available , the opportunity for a more quantitative assessment of quark gluon plasma properties using state - of - the - art dynamical approaches is emerging @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "this article presents an overview on anisotropic flow in hybrid approaches .",
    "the scope is limited to the strict definition of hybrid approaches by selecting only results from calculations where a hydrodynamic evolution is combined with a transport approach .",
    "this restriction is necessary to keep the article focussed and means to exclude interesting work on transport approaches that exploit hydrodynamic features , but also hydrodynamic calculations that do not match to transport calculations at any point .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in section [ hybrid ] the basics of hybrid approaches are introduced including a description of the main features of transport and hydrodynamics and the transition criterion between both . in section [ normal_hybrid ] the traditional hybrid approaches where transport is applied for the late stages of the reaction are reviewed and results for elliptic flow calculations are presented . to study the effect of initial state fluctuations",
    "one can also employ a transport approach for the early non - equilibrium stage of the reaction and create the initial state for the fluid dynamical calculation event by event .",
    "this type of hybrid approach is presented in section [ fluc_ic ] .",
    "the last option is to combine hydrodynamics and transport in such a way that transport approaches are used for the initial and the final stages of the reaction and hydrodynamics is sandwiched between two dynamical stages with non - equilibrium properties .",
    "these full hybrid approaches are highlighted in section [ full_hybrid ] .",
    "the last section [ flow_exc ] is devoted to the study of anisotropic flow as a function of the beam energy within hybrid approaches .",
    "finally , section [ concl ] contains a summary of the major points and an outlook on future challenges .",
    "hybrid approaches are very successful to describe the dynamical evolution of heavy ion collisions at rhic and lhc energies @xcite .",
    "the idea behind hybrid approaches is to combine the advantages of transport and hydrodynamics .",
    "fluid dynamic calculations are based on conservation laws    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath3 is the net baryon current .",
    "local equilibration is assumed and only macroscopic information about the system is available .",
    "the main advantage of hydrodynamics is that the equation of state is an explicit input and allows for a direct connection to qcd properties as calculated on the lattice @xcite or by phenomenological models .",
    "nearly ideal hydrodynamics is applicable to the hot and dense stage of a heavy ion reaction where the density is high and the mean free path is small .",
    "recently , full ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional viscous hydrodynamic approaches are being developed and successfully applied to calculate observables in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the main focus has been on the influence of shear viscosity , even though there are more transport coefficients of interest , e.g. the bulk viscosity or heat conductivity .",
    "the interplay between bulk viscosity and shear viscosity has been studied in @xcite indicating that there might be non - trivial effects that are important for a more quantitative assessment of transport properties of the quark gluon plasma @xcite .    in the early and the late stages of the reaction ,",
    "the assumption of local equilibration can not be justified , therefore non - equilibrium transport approaches are better suited .",
    "transport calculations are based on the boltzmann equation with a collision kernel that is usually truncated at the 2-body level    @xmath4    a microscopic description of the whole phase - space distribution is provided which is based on hadronic or partonic degrees of freedom and their respective interaction cross - sections . even though there are attempts to describe a phase transition within transport approaches , the microscopic mechanism for hadronization is poorly understood so far .",
    "a combination of hydrodynamics with transport approaches has become the standard state - of - the - art to cover the whole evolution of heavy ion reaction at high energies in a realistic way .",
    "hydrodynamics allows for an assessment of macroscopic features e.g. the equation of state and transport properties like the shear and bulk viscosity while hadronic transport is valuable to model the decoupling process including a separated chemical and kinetic freeze - out .",
    "one of the most crucial points in a hybrid approach is the question when to switch from the macroscopic hydrodynamic to the microscopic transport description .",
    "ideally there is a region in which the two calculations are equivalent and a change in the transition criterion does not affect the results for observables . in general , it is important that the equation of state on both sides of the transition surface is the same , i.e. a hadron gas with the same degrees of freedom as the transport approach of choice propagates .    in practice",
    ", the transition from the fluid dynamic regime to the microscopic description is treated as follows .",
    "the quark gluon plasma is converted to hadronic degrees of freedom via the equation of state that is an input to the hydrodynamic description .",
    "the transition hypersurface for particlization ( the conversion from fluid to particles ) needs to be determined according to the cooper - frye formula @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the grand - canonical boosted particle distribution function in each hypersurface element , with normal @xmath7 , and the total momentum distribution is an integral over the entire surface @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is the degeneracy of the particle in question .",
    "there are different techniques how to construct a proper hypersurface in 4 dimensions , one particular implementation has been described in @xcite and the corresponding cornelius code is publicly available on the oscar archive .    on this hypersurface particles are sampled using monte carlo methods .",
    "the resulting phase space distribution of hadrons is propagated further in a hadron transport approach . in viscous hydrodynamics",
    "the deviation from the equilibrium distribution function needs to be taken into account .",
    "a common approach is to parametrize the @xmath10 term proportional to @xmath11 , the so called democratic ansatz , but in principle the species dependent varaiations need to be determined by kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "another issue in the sampling process are the negative contributions , that are neglected in most hybrid approaches .",
    "depending on the relative orientation of flow velocities and hypersurface vectors @xmath7 a fraction of the particles flies back into the dense region that is described by fluid dynamics . without dynamical coupling between the fluid dynamic and the microscopic regime , it is hard to take these contributions into account in a consistent fashion .",
    "recently , an algorithmic idea has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that the negative contributions to the particle spectra at midrapdity are rather small ( 5% or even smaller ) , but they might increase at forward rapidities and when event by event fluctuations are included @xcite .",
    "an intuitive criterion for the switching between fluid dynamics and microscopic transport is that the scattering rate reaches a critical value where the mean free path is too much increased to apply hydrodynamics . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown , that such a dynamical criterion gives very similar results for bulk observables like the commonly applied temperature criterion .",
    "for heavy ion collisions at lower beam energies where the net baryo chemical potential is finite , an energy density criterion might be more appropriate .",
    "a systematic investigation of transition criteria where the local equilibrum assumption breaks down across different beam energies and systems sizes would be desirable .",

    "the mean transverse momentum gives an indication how much radial flow is developed during the hadronic rescattering stage of the collision . in the upper plot , the final values ( symbols ) are compared to the ones from the fluid dynamic evolution at a temperature of 160 mev .",
    "comparing the symbols with the grey lines shows that there is only a mass dependent increase , if the fluid evolution is run to lower temperatures .",
    "the lines in the lower figure indicate the radial flow that was generated by the hydrodynamic evolution for several hadron species .",
    "it is clearly visible that the transverse flow of protons and @xmath15 s is significantly increased during the non - equilibrium evolution , whereas for @xmath16 and @xmath17 baryons the effect is negligible .",
    "the hadronic cross - sections for the multi - strange particles are too small to change their radial flow .",
    "pions on the other hand undergo a lot of interactions and are affected by a large amount of resonance decays , such that the final result does not differ much from the value directly at the transition .    the general outcome from these early studies , that the multi - strange particles are frozen out at the transition surface and the protons suffer the major effect of the hadronic rescattering",
