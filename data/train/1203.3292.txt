    "in contrast to these approaches , delfour and zolesio @xcite established elasticity models on surfaces using the signed distance function , which can be used to describe the geometric properties of a surface . in particular , the intrinsic tangential derivatives were used for modeling purposes as the main differential geometric tool and the partial differential equations were established in three dimensions .",
    "a similar concept had been used earlier in a finite element setting for the numerical discretization of the laplace - beltrami operator on surfaces by dziuk @xcite , resulting in a remarkably clean and simple implementation . for diffusion - like problems ,",

    ", e.g. , @xcite    the purpose of this paper is to begin to explore the possibilities of the intrinsic approach in finite element modeling of thin - shell structures , focusing on the simplest model , that of the membrane shell without bending stiffness .",
    "we derive a membrane model using the intrinsic framework and generalize the finite element approach of @xcite .",

    "is given by @xmath15 and we can then define the surface gradient @xmath16 as @xmath17 the surface gradient thus has three components , which we shall denote by @xmath18 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\sigma_2 } \\\\[3 mm ] \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\sigma_3 } \\",

    "we next define a surface strain tensor @xmath22 which is extensively used in @xcite , where it is employed to derive models of shells based on purely mathematical arguments .    from a mechanical point of view",
    ", the problem of using @xmath23 as a fundamental measure of strain on a surface lies in it not being an in - plane tensor , in that @xmath24 .",
    "the shear strains associated with the out - of - plane direction are typically neglected in mechanical models , but are present in @xmath23 ( cf .",
    "remark [ remarkstrain ] ) . to obtain an in - plane strain tensor we need to use the projection twice to define @xmath25 which lacks all out - of - plane strain components . for a shell , where plane stress is assumed , this strain tensor can still be used , since out - of - plane strains do not contribute to the strain energy .",

    ".    however , the tensor @xmath33 is rather cumbersome to use directly in a numerical implementation ; it would be much easier to work with @xmath34 which can be establish using tangential derivatives .",
    "for this reason , we use the fact that there also holds ( as is easily confirmed ) @xmath35 and since @xmath36 we have the following relation : @xmath37 so that , using dyadic double - dot product , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a tensor and @xmath40 , @xmath41 are vectors , we arrive at @xmath42 which will be used in the finite element implementation below .",

    "let @xmath73 be a conforming , shape regular triangulation of @xmath0 , resulting in a discrete surface @xmath74 .",
    "we shall here consider an isoparametric parametrization of the surface ( the same idea can however be used for arbitrary parametrizations ) . in the numerical examples below we use a piecewise linear approximation , meaning that the elements @xmath75 will be planar .",
