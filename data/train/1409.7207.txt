    "a study of swarm dynamics benefits from a description and representation of the true communication that follows those information transfers  @xcite . as already highlighted , any real communication channel , irrespective of its topology and the nature of the signal , has a finite informational capacity owing to its noisiness and limited bandwidth . for natural swarms",
    ", channels may consist of chemicals ( e.g. chemotactic aggregation of amoebae , colony of ants ) or of various forms of energy such as electromagnetic waves and light , sound vibrations , pressure or temperature . in practice , more than one channel",
    "may be operating simultaneously as is the case with fish while schooling where both vision and lateral line sensing are required  @xcite .",
    "recently , a network - theoretic approach focusing on the specificities of the interaction network of natural swarms has emerged  @xcite .",
    "that approach opens new avenues for the study of the unifying concept of swarm information flow representing the propagation of behavioral changes .",
    "however , such a high - level structural representation should not hide the complexity of a central part of the real informational channel associated with the agents sensory cascade  @xcite  detection , processing followed by response ",
    "taking place when information hits a node and is routed through the swarm signaling network ( ssn )  @xcite .",
    "this crucial factor can be better fathomed when considering the prototypical swarming behavior of predator avoidance of fish and marine insects  @xcite or flocking birds  @xcite in which the detection of an incoming predator triggers a fright response  in the form of a swift directional change  in a limited set of agents .",
    "these localized behavioral responses initiated by the informed agents constitute a signal transmitted through the medium ( edges of the ssn ) which , in turn , is detected by the agents ( nodes of the ssn ) linked to the informed nodes ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) if the ssn has the required connectedness .",
    "this latter property of the ssn has been shown to primarily depend on the interaction distance ",
    "metric , topological , or hybrid  @xcite  and the density of swarming agents , and to profoundly influence the consensus reaching dynamics  @xcite . for swarms of topologically - interacting agents ,",
    "we have established that the ssn is a homogeneous , small - world and moderately clustered network  @xcite . moreover",
    ", the ssn is a temporal adaptive network  @xcite , whose dynamics is tightly coupled to that of the agents in the physical space .",
    "it is therefore necessary to account for some of the functional details of each agent , and in particular , its sensory cascade  @xcite , which can conceptually be modeled using the control - theoretic concept of multi - input and multi - output plant  @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=42.0% ]    a full description of the information flow through a dynamic swarm would not be complete without another conceptual layer borrowing elements from information theory .",
    "as already mentioned , this integrated view of information and control theories has been successful in advancing our understanding of the interplay between control and communication in ndss  @xcite . if the total power in a channel is distributed between the signal @xmath0 and random ( gaussian ) noise @xmath1 , the shannon ",
    "hartley theorem provides the maximum rate of information transmission , or capacity @xmath2 , of the channel @xmath3 where @xmath4 represents the channel s bandwidth and @xmath5 is the signal - to - noise ratio  @xcite .",
    "bandwidth @xmath4 is technically defined as the range of frequencies that can be transmitted , but in natural systems the lowest frequency is always zero and it is therefore identified with the highest frequency at which the channel can be varied . in most real channels , the value of the bandwidth can not always be easily determined . in the particular case of human information exchange through speech",
    ", it has been shown that a bandwidth of 7  khz is required to distinctively understand individual syllables  @xcite . in the case of swarms",
    ", one has to consider @xmath6 associated with informational signaling through the medium  the network edges `` e '' : e.g. the ambient fluid for flocking birds , schooling fish and synapses for neurons  as well as @xmath7 for the sensory cascade internal to each agent  the network nodes `` n '' , which serve as routers for the behavioral information ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "returning to the problem of global information flow through the ssn , the max - flow min - cut theorem  @xcite informs us about informational bottlenecks , whereby the maximum information flow rate is given by the minimum capacity of the network edges or nodes . in other words , the spread of information through the swarm",
    "is either limited by the signaling through the medium ( extrinsic limit ) or by the agent s sensory cascade ( intrinsic limit ) . at this point , it is worth stressing yet another specificity of natural swarming individuals pertaining to this intrinsic limit to deal with information flow at the agent s level regardless of the nature of the signal and how it propagates information through the surrounding medium .",
    "indeed , for most animals ( including humans ) , there is an enormous gap between the information capacities of sensory organs and the capacity of the central nervous system to analyze and retain information  @xcite .",
    "consequently , without loss of generality , we can associate @xmath7 with the information processing capacity of the agent . to fix ideas ,",
    "it is interesting knowing that in the particular case of fire ants orientating , a rough estimate of @xmath7 is between 0.01 and 2 bits / s  @xcite .    as can be seen from  ( [ eq : c ] ) , the informational capacity is either bandwidth- or @xmath8-limited , therefore leading to only four possible distinct informational bottlenecks :    a.   low signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath9 , in the medium , which often occurs because of high levels of ambient noise ; b.   low signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath10 , within each agent ; c.   low bandwidth or data rate , @xmath11 , of the medium ; d.   low bandwidth or data rate , @xmath12 , in processing information at the agent s central nervous system level .",
    "note that option ( iii ) is physically irrelevant since in most media , @xmath11 is typically very high  @xcite , unless it is artificially constrained .      in the sequel , we focus on the overlooked option ( iv ) ( see discussion ) and study the effects of information flow breakdowns in swarms stemming from either the finiteness of the agents bandwidth @xmath13 or an artificially - induced reduction in @xmath13 . given the nyquist theorem , to consider the effects of a reduction in @xmath13 is equivalent to considering an increase in the unit interval @xmath14 , which is the minimum time interval between condition changes of data transmission signal , a.k.a .",

    "the stability of the dynamical system would be governed and controlled by the spectral properties of the constant perron matrix  @xcite . in the present case",

    "as already highlighted , option ( iii ) , which corresponds to low @xmath11 , is physically irrelevant for naturally evolving swarms .",
    "the influence of low @xmath9 in the medium , option ( i ) , can be used to explain empirical evidences of some specific swarming breakdowns : e.g. schools of fish disperse at dusk  @xcite .",
    "essentially , the phase transitions uncovered using vicsek s model and its variations  @xcite , from a collectively ordered phase to a disordered one following an increase in ambient noise level , can be traced back to information flow breakdowns through noisy channels : either with low @xmath9  @xcite as in option ( i ) , or with low @xmath10  @xcite as in option ( ii ) .",
    "other empirical evidences are stressing the importance of a sufficiently - high bandwidth   relates bandwidth and frequency of update ] in complex adaptive systems : e.g. information transmission through signaling relay during the collective migration of social amoebae  @xcite , or the induction of differential anesthesia when chemically reducing the firing frequency of neurons in dorsal root ganglions  @xcite .",
    "these empirical evidences are additional motivations for our investigation of the overlooked option ( iv ) and the associated study of the effects of information flow breakdowns in swarms stemming from either the finiteness of the agents bandwidth @xmath13 or an artificially - induced reduction in @xmath13 or @xmath11 .",
    "the study of these limiting effects on swarm dynamics has been carried out using two complementary approaches .",
    "first , we neglected the effects of noise in eq .   and modeled the swarm as a networked sampled - data system governed by eq .",
    "( see methods & results ) .",
    "the study of the stability and asymptotic stability of the swarm dynamics led to eq .",

    ". this sufficient condition on the bandwidth @xmath13 reveals the profound connection between , on the one hand the switching communication topology  through the maximum eigenvalue of the normalized directed graph laplacian @xmath65 of the signaling network , and on the other hand , the necessary information flow for effective swarming measured by the bandwidth @xmath13 .",
    "we speculate that the effects of not satisfying this condition ( i.e. having @xmath66 ) can readily be tested experimentally using a simple setup consisting of fish schooling in a tank with a stroboscopic light shining onto them . by reducing the frequency @xmath67 of the flash",
    ", we artificially force the decrease in @xmath13 ( and @xmath11 ) and we expect that at a given critical frequency @xmath68 , the coordinated schooling behavior will disappear .",
    "we further speculate that owing to their evolutionary - optimized character , biological swarming agents such as fish and birds do not naturally exhibit the bandwidth - induced swarming collapse uncovered here . beyond the consequences for self - organized biological systems",
    ", our work also highlights the importance of having sufficient information signaling capacity when designing artificial swarms so as to ensure their effectiveness . at a more qualitative level",
    ", our analysis also provides the first physical explanation for the required minimum firing frequency of neurons in dorsal root ganglions to maintain consciousness and thereby avoid inducing differential anesthesia  @xcite .",
    "the second approach used to study the limiting effects of information bottlenecks on swarm dynamics consists in carrying out actual spp simulations .",
    "that approach has the advantage of incorporating the combined effects of @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "more importantly , it allows us to carefully study changes in the swarm dynamics in the vicinity of the collapse of long - range order , i.e. the phase transition .",
    "that was not possible with our first approach that focused on preventing a swarming collapse in the absence of noise .",
    "it is worth adding that most spp simulations heretofore reported in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) have been generated using arbitrary , yet sufficiently high , bandwidth levels .",
    "therefore , in those past works , the collapse of swarming is rooted in the noisiness of the signaling channel . for all swarm sizes ,",
    "the simulation results confirm the occurrence of a swarming collapse as expected from our analytical study of the networked sampled - data system   ( see results ) .",
    "the key point revealed by these simulations concerns the existence of a transition line for which the critical bandwidth varies with the noise , i.e. @xmath60 . the existence of this transition line could have been anticipated from the interplay between noise and bandwidth originating from the shannon ",
    "hartley theorem and the expression   for the channel capacity . indeed , along the transition line @xmath69",
    ", we have that @xmath70 decreases with decreasing @xmath56 .",
    "this important observation is consistent with our intuition that a higher noise level would require a higher volume of information to be exchanged for the swarm to self organize . from the information - theoretic viewpoint ,",
    "this trend can readily be explained if we assume the existence of a minimum `` critical '' rate of information @xmath71 below which a collapse of swarming occurs . at the critical point , the max - flow min - cut theorem  @xcite gives us @xmath72 and given expression  ( [ eq : c ] ) , we have that @xmath73 with @xmath74 . despite the singularity in shannon s capacity at the zero - noise limit",
    ", our approach allows us to determine the critical bandwidth in this limit through the intersection of the @xmath75 for several nonzero values of @xmath56 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "we consider a minimalists model for the swarming system , which consists of @xmath1 topologically interacting spps  @xcite , moving at constant speed @xmath63 through a @xmath76 domain having periodic boundaries .",
    "each individual @xmath47 is characterized by its direction of travel @xmath16 , and a canonical swarming behavior of the consensus type is examined . to account for the finiteness of the bandwidth",
    ", we consider synchronous information exchanges occuring every @xmath14 , where the unit interval @xmath22 is the minimum time interval between condition changes of data transmission signal , a.k.a .",
    "the symbol duration time  @xcite .",
    "the agents move synchronously at discrete time steps @xmath22 by a fixed distance @xmath77 upon receiving informational signals from their neighbors as per the linear update rule @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the fixed number of individuals in the topological neighborhood @xmath80 of @xmath47 and @xmath81 is a gaussian white noise ( @xmath82 $ ] ) .    even though directions are intrinsically nonlinear quantities , such linear consensus models are known  @xcite to yield phase transitions similar to those obtained with nonlinear models , such as the one in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , eq .  ( [ swarmdisc ] ) is a discrete - time version of the minimal model consistent with experimental correlations in natural flocks of birds , while also predicting the propagation of order throughout entire flocks  @xcite .",
    "note that the growing body of evidence in support of a topological model of interaction between flocking birds  @xcite guided our choice .",
