    "the observations presented in this work provide deeper constraints on the combination of rotational energy and circumburst density by factors of @xmath152 .",

    "overall , our observations rule out a magnetar energy of @xmath6  erg for half of the events in our sample .",
    "thus , we can rule out the presence of an _ indefinitely _ stable magnetar in a significant fraction of short grbs with anomalous x - ray behavior .",

    "our observations rule out a magnetar with an energy reservoir of @xmath7  erg associated with a single event , grb050724a , which has a maximum allowed energy of @xmath161  erg ( table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "this event exhibited extended emission in the x - ray band which has previously been attributed to the spin - down energy of a long - lived magnetar @xcite .",
    "if the merger that produced grb050724a resulted in a remnant ns with a typical mass of @xmath162 ( e.g. , @xcite , their figure  4 ) , this would imply that the ns eos must be relatively soft at high densities , such that it supports a maximum ( non - rotating ) ns mass of @xmath163 .",
    "this limit is also also supported by constraints from observations of radio pulsars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if a remnant ns is responsible for the extended x - ray emission of grb050724a and the ns eos is indeed soft , the remnant ns could be on the high mass end of the supramassive range ( @xmath164 ) , such that it imparts a relatively small amount of rotational energy of @xmath165  erg to the surrounding medium before collapsing to a bh . in this case , the collapse time would be significantly less than the dipole spin - down timescale . by fitting the extended x - ray emission to a magnetar model , @xcite derived an initial spin period of @xmath166  ms and magnetic field strength of @xmath167  g , giving a dipole spin - down timescale of @xmath168  sec ( equation  [ eqn : tsd ] ) which is indeed longer than the observed timescale of extended emission of @xmath169  sec .",
    "we note that the above conclusions are dependent on the value of @xmath61 , and a very low value of @xmath61 would result in less stringent constraints on the energy of a magnetar .",
    "our observational constraints would also be weakened if a large fraction of the magnetar rotational energy is emitted as gravitational waves instead of through electromagnetic spin - down ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . however ,",
    "this is unlikely during the supramassive ns phase unless the internal magnetic field is two orders of magnitude larger than the external dipole field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or if the saturation amplitude of the @xmath170-mode instability is higher than commonly believed @xcite .    0.0 in",

    "@xcite used a broad - band afterglow model with time - varying energy injection due to spin - down of a long - lived magnetar to fit the x - ray and optical emission of four short grbs with x - ray plateaus , and made predictions for the associated radio emission .",
    "for the two events which overlap with our sample , grbs051221a and 130603b , the predicted radio emission is @xmath171jy at ghz frequencies at @xmath172  days after the burst @xcite , consistent with the limits in this paper .",
    "similarly , fits to the luminosity and duration of short grb x - ray plateaus with the magnetar model resulted in @xmath173  erg of energy emitted during the plateau phase @xcite , consistent with the values of @xmath140 from our studies . in order to accommodate both the early - time x - ray activity and the limits on the long - term radio emission , we conclude that supramassive magnetars which inject a total energy of @xmath174  erg must be relatively common compared to stable magnetars .",
    "if the total energy constraints were uniformly more stringent , @xmath175  erg , the collapse to a bh should be relatively abrupt ( i.e. , during the plateau phase itself ) , and we would expect more events with dramatic drops in their x - ray light curves , similar to grb090515 @xcite .",
    "we note that the radio emission model ( section  [ sec : model ] ) applied in this paper neglects relativistic effects , both on the ejecta dynamics and the emission ( e.g. , relativistic doppler beaming ) . to understand how this simplification affects our results , we generate light curve models for the parameters considered by @xcite , who interpolate their results to also consider the relativistic limit .",
    "we find that for models with ejecta mass of @xmath88 , the peak fluxes and timescales are virtually identical across the full range of densities and energies considered here .",
    "however , for a lower ejecta mass of @xmath176 , the peak fluxes are elevated by a factor of @xmath177 and the deceleration timescales are shortened by a factor of @xmath178 when compared to the newtonian case .",
    "therefore , incorporating relativistic effects only serves to make the predicted emission brighter , which then makes our observations even more constraining .",
    "we study the long - term radio behavior of nine short grbs with early - time excess emission in the x - ray band that may signify the presence of magnetars . through our vla observations on rest - frame timescales of @xmath179  yr after the bursts , we find no radio emission to luminosity limits of @xmath180  erg  s@xmath5 at @xmath47  ghz .",
    "our study demonstrates that a significant fraction of short grbs with anomalous x - ray behavior do not have the associated radio emission predicted from long - lived magnetars with energy reservoirs of @xmath6  erg .",
    "we also rule out a stable magnetar with an energy reservoir of @xmath7  erg in a single case , grb050724a .",
    "these radio observations , together with the known x - ray behavior , imply that supramassive magnetars which inject @xmath174  erg of energy are common relative to stable magnetars .",
    "our study shows that a stiff ns eos , corresponding to a maximum stable ( non - rotating ) ns mass of @xmath181 , is disfavored , unless the ns mergers which give rise to short grbs are particularly massive . however , population synthesis models suggest that such massive binaries only comprise a small fraction of all ns mergers @xcite",
    ". a comparison of the observed rate of short grbs to constraints on the ns merger rate from advanced ligo / virgo will soon provide insight on the fraction of ns mergers which give rise to short grbs , and thus additional insight on the ns eos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "upcoming wide - field radio surveys will also constrain the population of long - lived magnetars @xcite , independent of an association with short grbs .",
    "we can not rule out that a long - lived magnetar is responsible for the extended x - ray activity after some short grbs .",
    "however , we can conclude that most such remnants should be supramassive and hence should collapse to black holes on timescales which are comparable to or shorter than their magnetic dipole spin - down timescales .",
    "if future radio observations can uniformly constrain the total available energy from a magnetar to @xmath175  erg , we should expect more abrupt collapse signatures in the x - ray light curves of short grb afterglows .",
    "the lack of evidence for stable , long - lived magnetars may impact observational signatures from ns mergers at other wavelengths . for example , neutron - rich outflows from the ns merger form heavy elements via the @xmath170-process and undergo radioactive decay , resulting in a kilonova transient @xcite . in the absence of a long - lived magnetar",
    ", the signal is expected to peak in the near - ir band on @xmath37week timescales due to the large opacities of the heavy elements produced @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the large neutrino luminosity from a long - lived magnetar may inhibit the formation of very heavy elements , resulting in a bluer kilonova which peaks at optical wavelengths on @xmath37day timescales @xcite .",
    "if the sample in this paper is representative of all ns mergers , this supports the idea that kilonovae associated with ns mergers peak in the redder bands .",
    "since ns mergers are expected to be strong sources of gravitational waves , similar searches for long - term radio emission following ns mergers detected within the advanced ligo / virgo horizon distance of @xmath182  mpc will be able to place limits of @xmath183  erg  s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , such searches will be crucial in constraining the fraction of mergers that lead to magnetars with delayed or no collapse to a black hole , to significantly higher confidence than is possible with the cosmological sample .",
