    "in @xcite several new exact solutions to the einstein field equations were derived .",
    "these solutions are characterized by a spherical boundary membrane , consisting out of tangential pressure .",
    "one of the new solution turned out to be of particular interest .",
    "the so called holographic solution is characterized by the property that its boundary membrane carries a stress - energy - content equal to its gravitating mass .",
    "the membrane s pressure is equal to the pressure of the - fictitious - membrane attributed to a black hole by the membrane paradigm .",
    "this guarantees , that the holostar s action on the exterior space - time is by all practical purposes identical to that of a black hole .",
    "the holostar s geometric properties have been discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "the holographic solution has no free parameters , yet it turned out to be an astoundingly accurate description of the universe as we see it today .",
    "the holostar s interior matter - state can be interpreted as a collection of radially outlayed strings , attached to the holostar s spherical boundary membrane @xcite .",
    "the interior strings are densely packed , their mutual transverse separation is exactly one planck area .",
    "this dense package explains , why the holostar does nt collapse to a singularity , although its boundary membrane lies just roughly two planck coordinate distances outside of its gravitational radius .",
    "although the holostar s total interior matter - density has a definite string character , at least part of the matter can be interpreted in terms of particles . in this paper a simple thermodynamic model for the interior matter state is explored , which allows us to derive the hawking entropy and temperature relations for a spherically symmetric black hole by microscopic statistical thermodynamics in the ideal gas approximation .",
    "the holographic solution is an exact solution to the einstein field equations with zero cosmological constant .",
    "the spherically symmetric metric of the holographic solution has been derived in @xcite :    @xmath4    @xmath5    with    @xmath6 @xmath7    all quantities are expressed in geometric units @xmath8 . for clarity @xmath9 will be shown explicitly .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are the heavyside - step functional and the dirac - delta functional respectively .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the radial coordinate position of the holostar s surface , which divides the space - time manifold into an interior source region with a non - zero matter - distribution and an exterior vacuum space - time .",
    "@xmath13 is the radial coordinate position of the gravitational radius ( schwarzschild radius ) of the holostar .",
    "@xmath13 is directly proportional to the gravitating mass @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is a fundamental length parameter .",
    "has been assumed to be roughly twice the planck - length in @xcite .",
    "the analysis in @xcite indicates @xmath16 at low energies . in this paper a more definite relationship in terms of the total number of particle degrees of freedom at high temperatures will be derived . ]",
    "the matter fields ( mass density , principal pressures ) of any spherically symmetric gravitationally bound object can be derived from the metric by simple differentiation ( see for example @xcite ) . for the discussion in this paper",
    "only the _ radial _ metric coefficient @xmath17 is essential . in the spherically symmetric case the total mass - energy density @xmath18",
    "can be calculated _ solely _ from the radial metric coefficient . for any spherically symmetric self gravitating object",
    "the following general relation holds :    @xmath19    it is obvious from the above equation , that a matter - density @xmath20 is special .",
    "it renders the differential equation for @xmath21 homogeneous and leads to a strictly linear dependence between @xmath21 and the radial distance coordinate @xmath22 .    with @xmath21 given by equation ( [ eq : a ] ) the energy - density turns out to be :    @xmath23    within the holostar s interior",
    "the mass - energy density follows an inverse square law . outside of the membrane ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath24 , it is identical zero .",
    "note , that @xmath12 must not necessarily be finite .    in the following discussion",
    "the argument @xmath25 of the @xmath10- and @xmath11-distributions will be omitted .",
    "the radial and tangential pressures also follow from the metric :    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28 is the radial pressure .",
    "it is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the mass - density .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the tangential pressure , which is zero everywhere , except for a @xmath11-functional at the holostar s surface .",

    ", the time - coefficient of the metric @xmath31 must be known .",
    "for the holostar equation of state with @xmath32 we have @xmath33 .",
    "other equations of state lead to different time - coefficients , and therefore different principal pressures .",
    "neither the particular form of the time - coefficient of the metric , nor the particular form of the principal pressures are important for the main results derived in this paper , which are based on equilibrium thermodynamics , where time evolution is irrelevant ( as long as the relevant time scale is long enough , that thermal equilibrium can be attained ) .",
    "the essential assumptions are :    * spherical symmetry * a radial metric coefficient @xmath34 * a total energy density @xmath35 * microscopic statistical thermodynamics of an ideal gas of ultra - relativistic fermions and bosons ( in the context of the grand - canonical ensemble )    if the validity of einstein s field equations with zero cosmological constant is assumed , conditions two and three are interchangeable .    throughout this paper",
    "i will frequently use the term holographic solution , or holostar , to refer to an object with the above stated properties .",
    "the reader should keep in mind , though , that the holographic solution is just a special case of a solution with a matter - density @xmath36 .",
    "the results derived in this paper refer to any solution with the above properties .    in the following sections i assume that @xmath37 is nearly constant , i.e. more or less independent of the size of the holostar and comparable to the planck area @xmath38 :    @xmath39    this assumption will be justified later .",
    "the interior metric of the holostar solution is well behaved and the interior matter - density is non - zero .",
    "the solution is static : the matter appears to exert a radial pressure preventing further collapse to a point singularity .",
    "this can be best seen in the string picture @xcite .",
    "however , the solution gives no direct indication with respect to the state of the interior matter and the origin of the pressure .    in this section",
    "i will discuss a very simple model for the interior matter state of the holostar , which is able to explain many phenomena attributed to black holes .",
    "let us assume that the interior matter distribution is dominated by ultra - relativistic weakly interacting fermions and the pressure is produced by the exclusion principle .",
    "due to spherical symmetry the mean momentum of the fermions @xmath40 and their number density per proper volume @xmath41 will only depend on the radial distance coordinate @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath42 denotes the effective number of degrees of freedom of the fermions . for ultra - relativistic fermions",
    "the local energy - density will be given by the product of the number density of the fermions and their mean momentum .",
    "this energy density must be equal to the interior mass - energy density of the holostar :    @xmath43    if the fermions interact only weakly , their mean momenta can be estimated by the exclusion principle :    @xmath44    these two equations can be solved for @xmath40 and @xmath45 :    @xmath46    @xmath47    the mean momenta of the fermions within the holostar fall off from the center as @xmath48 and the number density per proper volume with @xmath49 .",
    "similar dependencies , however without definite factors , have already been found in @xcite by analyzing the geodesic motion of the interior massless particles in the holostar - metric .",
    "it is remarkable , that equilibrium thermodynamics combined with the uncertainty principle gives the same results as the geodesic equations of motion .",
    "this is not altogether unexpected . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown , that the field equations of general relativity follow from thermodynamics and the bekenstein entropy bound @xcite .",
    "the momentum of the fermions at a planck - distance @xmath50 from the center of the holostar is of the order of the planck - energy @xmath51 .",
    "it is also interesting to note , that for both quantities @xmath40 and @xmath45 the number of degrees of freedom @xmath42 can be absorbed in the radial coordinate value @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 and @xmath54 effectively depend on @xmath55 .",
    "we will see later that the square root of @xmath42 plays an important role in the scaling of the fundamental length parameter @xmath15 .    from ( [ eq : plocr ] ) one can derive the following momentum - area law for holostars , which resembles the stefan - boltzmann law for radiation from a black body :    @xmath56    note that this law not only refers to the holostar s surface ( @xmath57 ) but is valid for any concentric spherical surface of radius @xmath22 within the holostar .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that the holostar has a well defined interior temperature @xmath58 proportional to the mean momentum @xmath40 :    @xmath59    @xmath60 is a constant factor .",
    "we will see later , that it is related to the entropy per particle .",
    "the local surface temperature of the holostar is given by :    @xmath61    the surface redshift @xmath62 is given by :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is assumed .",
    "the local surface temperature can be compared to the hawking temperature of a black hole .",
    "the hawking temperature is measured at infinity .",
    "therefore the red - shift of the radiation emitted from the holostar s surface with respect to an observer at spatial infinity has to be taken into account , by dividing the local temperature at the surface by the gravitational red shift factor @xmath62 .",
    "with @xmath65 we find :    @xmath66    the surface - temperature measured at infinity has the same dependence on the gravitational radius @xmath12 as the hawking temperature , which is given by :    @xmath67    up to a possibly different constant factor the hawking temperature of a spherically symmetric black hole and the respective temperature of the holostar at infinity are equal .",
    "as the hawking temperature of a black hole only depends on the properties of the exterior space - time , and the exterior space - times of a black hole and the holostar are equal ( up to a small planck - sized region outside the horizon ) , it is reasonable to assume that the hawking temperature should be the true temperature of a holostar measured at spatial infinity . with this assumption",
    ", the constant @xmath60 can be determined by setting the temperatures of equations ( [ eq : t_inf ] ) and ( [ eq : t_hawking ] ) equal :    @xmath68    the total number of fermions within the holostar is given by the proper integral over the number - density :    @xmath69    @xmath70 is the proper volume element , which can be read off from the metric :    @xmath71    integration over the total interior volume of the holostar gives :    @xmath72    @xmath73 is the bekenstein - hawking entropy for a spherically symmetric black hole with horizon surface area @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the number of fermions within the holostar is proportional to its surface area and thus proportional to the hawking entropy .",
    "this result is very much in agreement with the holographic principle @xcite , giving it quite a new and radical interpretation : the degrees of freedom of a highly relativistic self - gravitating object do nt only `` live on the surface '' , the object contains a definite number of particles and their total number is proportional to the object s surface area , measured in units of the planck - area , @xmath38 .",
    "this result is an immediate consequence of the interior metric @xmath75 , the energy - momentum relation for relativistic particles @xmath76 and the exclusion principle .",
    "it can be easily shown , that for any other spherically symmetric metric , for example @xmath77 , the number of interior ( fermionic ) particles is not proportional to the boundary area .    from equation ( [ eq : nclassic ] ) we can see that @xmath60 is the entropy per particle .",
    "this allows a rough estimate of @xmath78 : the entropy of an ultra - relativistic particle should be of order unity ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom in the standard model of particle physics - with the usual counting rule , weighting the fermionic degrees of freedom with @xmath80 - amount to @xmath81 .",
    "supersymmetry essentially doubles this number .",
    "it is expected , that a unified theory will not vastly exceed this number . for @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    "we find @xmath84 .",
    "this justifies the assumption , that the fundamental length parameter @xmath15 should be of order planck - length .    by help of equation ( [ eq : s ] )",
    "the local temperature can be expressed in terms of @xmath78 alone :    @xmath85    note that @xmath78 depends explicitly on the ( effective ) number of degrees of freedom @xmath42 of the ultra - relativistic particles within the holostar via equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "at the center of the holostar all the fermion momenta are comparable to the planck energy , as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : tlocal ] ) .",
    "all fermions of the standard model of particle physics will be ultra - relativistic .",
    "quite likely there will be other fundamental particles of a grand unified theory ( gut ) , as well as other entities such as strings and branes .",
    "thus , close to the holostar s center the number of ultra - relativistic degrees of freedom will be at its maximum and @xmath78 will be close to unity .",
    "the farther one is distanced from the center , the lower the local temperature gets . at @xmath86",
    "the electrons will become non - relativistic .",
    "the only particles of the standard model that remain relativistic at larger radial positions will be the neutrinos .",
    "if all neutrinos are massive , the mass of the lightest neutrino will define a characteristic radius of the holostar , beyond which there are no relativistic fermions contributing to the holostar s internal pressure .",
    "if at least one of the neutrinos is massless , there will be no limit to the spatial extension of a holostar .",
    "note , that the radial coordinate position at which the holostar s interior radiation temperature is equal to the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation , @xmath87 , corresponds to roughly @xmath88 , i.e. quite close to the radius of the observable universe .",
    "this is just one of several coincidences , which point to the very real possibility , that the holostar or a variant thereof actually might serve as an alternative , beautifully simple model for the universe . for a more detailed discussion including some definite cosmological predictions , which are all experimentally verified within an error of maximally",
    "15 % see @xcite .",
    "whenever the temperature within the holostar becomes comparable to the mass of a particular fermion species , a phase transition is expected to take place at the respective @xmath22-position .",
    "such a transition will lower the effective value of @xmath42 , as one of the particles `` freezes '' out .",
    "whenever @xmath42 changes , either @xmath60 or @xmath78 must adjust due to equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "the question is , whether @xmath60 or @xmath78 ( or both ) will change .",
    "presumably @xmath60 will at least approximately retain a constant value : the entropy per ultra - relativistic fermion , as well as the mean particle momentum per temperature , appears to be a local property which should not depend on the ( effective ) number of degrees of freedom of the particles at a particular @xmath22-position .    under the assumption that @xmath60 is nearly constant",
    ", the ratio of @xmath89 must be nearly constant as well , as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : s ] ) .",
    "whenever @xmath42 changes , @xmath78 will adjust accordingly .",
    "lowering the effective number of degrees of freedom leads to a flattening of the temperature - curve , as heat ( and entropy ) is transferred to the remaining ultra - relativistic particles . at any radial position of a phase transition , where a fermion becomes non - relativistic and annihilates with its anti - particle , the temperature",
    "is expected to deviate from the expression @xmath90 .",
    "this is quite similar to what is believed to have happened in the very early universe , when the temperature fell below the electron - mass threshold and the subsequent annihilation of electron / positron pairs heated up the photon gas , keeping the temperature of the expanding universe nearly constant until all positrons were destroyed .",
    "if the `` freeze - out '' happens without significant heat and entropy transfer to the remaining gas of ultra - relativistic particles , such as when the particle that `` freezes '' out has an appreciable non - zero chemical potential , the effective value of @xmath42 will remain nearly constant , which would imply that @xmath78 be nearly constant as well . in this case",
    "@xmath78 as well as @xmath42 would be nearly constant universal quantities .",
    "there is evidence that this might actually be the case .",
    "in this section i will discuss a somewhat more sophisticated model for the thermodynamic properties of the holostar .",
    "as has been demonstrated in the previous section , if the holostar contains at least one fermionic species , its properties very much resemble the schwarzschild vacuum black hole solution , when viewed from the outside : due to birkhoff s theorem the external gravitational field can not be distinguished from that of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "its temperature measured at infinity is proportional to the hawking temperature .    due to its non - zero surface - temperature and entropy",
    "the holostar will gradually lose particles by emission from its surface .",
    "the ( exterior ) time scale of this process will be comparable to the hawking evaporation time scale @xmath91 ( see for example @xcite ) . the ( exterior ) time for a photon to travel radially through the holostar is proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "therefore even comparatively small holostars are expected to have an evaporation time several orders of magnitude longer than their interior relaxation time .",
    "this allows us , with the possible exception of near planck - size holostars , to consider any spherical thin shell within the holostar s interior to be in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings .",
    "each shell can exchange particles , energy and entropy with adjacent shells on a time scale much shorter than the life - time of the holostar . under these assumptions",
    "the thermodynamic parameters within each shell can be calculated via the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "we mentally partition the holostar into a collection of thin spherical shells .",
    "the temperature scales as @xmath93 and thus varies very slowly with @xmath22 . for the chemical potential(s ) let us assume a slowly varying function with @xmath22 as well .",
    "this assumption will be justified later . under these circumstances",
    "the thickness of each shell @xmath94 can be chosen such , that it is large enough to be considered macroscopic , and at the same time small enough , so that the temperature , pressure and chemical potential(s ) are effectively constant within the shell .",
    "an accurate thermodynamic description has to take into account a possible potential energy of position . for the holostar a significant simplification arises from the fact , that the effective potential @xmath95 for the motion of massless , i.e. ultra - relativistic , particles is nearly constant .",
    "the equations of motion for ultra - relativistic particles within the holostar s interior were given by @xcite :    @xmath96    and    @xmath97    @xmath98 is the radial velocity of a photon , expressed as fraction to the local velocity of light in the ( purely ) radial direction .",
    "@xmath99 is the tangential velocity of the photon , expressed as a fraction to the local velocity of light in the ( purely ) tangential direction .",
    "@xmath100 is the turning point of the motion . for pure radial motion @xmath101 .    for pure radial motion",
    "the effective potential is constant with @xmath102 . in the case of angular motion ( @xmath103 )",
    "the effective potential approaches zero with @xmath104 , i.e. becomes nearly zero very rapidly , whenever @xmath22 is greater than a few @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , to a very good approximation we can regard the ultra - relativistic particles to move freely within each shell .",
    "their total energy will only depend on the relativistic energy - momentum relation , not on the radial position .    with these preliminaries",
    "the grand canonical potential @xmath105 of a small spherical shell of thickness @xmath94 for a gas of relativistic fermions at radial position @xmath22 will be given by :    @xmath106    @xmath107    @xmath108 is a dimensionless integration variable .",
    "@xmath109 is the chemical potential at radial coordinate position @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath58 is the local temperature at this position .",
    "note that even when the radial coordinate extension @xmath94 of the shell is small , the _ proper _ radial extension @xmath110 of the shell will become quite large because of the large value of the radial metric coefficient in the holostar s outer regions .",
    "knowing the results presented at the end of this section it is not difficult to show that - with the exception of the central region - it is possible to choose the radial extension of the shell such that the number of particles within the shell @xmath111 is macroscopic and at the same time @xmath58 and @xmath109 are constant to a very good approximation within the shell .",
    "the proper volume of the shell @xmath112 is given by the volume element of equation ( [ eq : dv ] ) .",
    "the ratio of chemical potential @xmath113 to local temperature @xmath114 is assumed to be a very slowly varying function of @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , we will see later that this ratio is virtually independent of @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio @xmath115 will be denoted by @xmath116 , keeping in mind that @xmath116 might depend on @xmath22 :    @xmath117    the integral in equation ( [ eq : j0 ] ) can be transformed to the following integral by a partial integration :    @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the mean occupancy number of the fermions :    @xmath120    knowing the grand canonical potential @xmath105 the entropy within the shell can be calculated :    @xmath121    by @xmath122 the following integrals are denoted :    @xmath123    such integrals commonly occur in the evaluation of feynman - integrals in qft and can be evaluated by the poly - logarithmic function @xmath124 :    @xmath125    for the derivation of the entropy the following identity has been used , which is easy to derive from the power - expansion of @xmath124 .    @xmath126    the pressure in the shell is given by :    @xmath127    the total energy in the shell can be calculated from the grand canonical potential via :    @xmath128    the total number of particles within the shell is given by :    @xmath129    the total energy per fermion within the shell is proportional to @xmath114 , as can be seen by combining equations ( [ eq : ef ] , [ eq : nf ] ) :    @xmath130    @xmath131 only depends indirectly on @xmath22 via @xmath116 .",
    "we will see later that @xmath116 is essentially independent of @xmath22 , so that the mean energy per particle is proportional to the temperature with nearly the same constant of proportionality at any radial position @xmath22 .",
    "the entropy per particle within the shell can be read off from equations ( [ eq : sf ] , [ eq : nf ] ) :    @xmath132    again , @xmath60 only depends on @xmath22 via @xmath116 .",
    "the calculations so far have been carried through for fermions .",
    "it is likely , that the holostar will also contain bosons in thermal equilibrium with the fermions .",
    "the equations for an ultra - relativistic boson gas are quite similar to the above equations for a fermion gas",
    ". we have to replace :    @xmath133    @xmath134    @xmath135    let us assume that the fermion and boson gases are only weakly interacting . in such a case the extrinsic quantities , such as energy and entropy , can be simply summed up .",
    "the same applies for the partial pressures .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom of fermions and bosons can differ .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom will be denoted by @xmath136 , the bosonic degrees of freedom by @xmath137 . in general",
    ", the different particle species will have different values for the chemical potentials .",
    "there are some restraints .",
    "bosons can not have a positive chemical potential , as @xmath138 is a complex number for positive @xmath116 .",
    "photons and gravitons , in fact all massless gauge - bosons , have a chemical potential of zero , as they can be created and destroyed without being restrained by a particle - number conservation law .",
    "we are however talking of a gas of ultra - relativistic particles . in this case particle - antiparticle",
    "pair production will take place abundantly , so that we also have to consider the antiparticles .",
    "the chemical potentials of particle and anti - particle add up to zero : @xmath139 .",
    "as bosons can not have a positive chemical potential , the chemical potential of any ultra - relativistic bosonic species must be zero , i.e. @xmath140 , whenever the energy is high enough to create boson / anti - boson pairs .",
    "this restriction does not apply to the fermions , which can have a non - zero chemical potential at ultra - relativistic energies , as both signs of the chemical potential are allowed .",
    "so for ultra - relativistic fermions we can fulfill the relation @xmath141 with non - zero @xmath142 .",
    "it is convenient to use the ratio of the chemical potential to the temperature @xmath143 as the relevant parameter instead of the chemical potential itself .",
    "if the number of degrees of freedom of fermions and bosons respectively , i.e. @xmath136 and @xmath137 is known , there are only two undetermined parameters in the model , @xmath144 and @xmath78 . in order to determine @xmath144 and @xmath78 one needs two independent relations . these can be obtained by comparing the holostar temperature and entropy to the hawking temperature and entropies respectively .    alternatively @xmath144 can be determined without reference to the hawking temperature law , solely by a thermodynamic argument .",
    "it is also possible to determine @xmath78 by a theoretical argument as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic energy of a shell consisting of an ultra - relativistic ideal fermion and boson gas is given by :    @xmath145    with    @xmath146    with the identities of the polylog - function and with @xmath147 one can express @xmath148 as a quadratic function of @xmath149 @xcite :    @xmath150    we take the convention here , that @xmath136 and @xmath137 denote the degrees of freedom of one particle species , including particle and antiparticle . with this convention a photon gas ( @xmath151 )",
    "is described by @xmath152 ( there are two photon degrees of freedom and the photon is its own anti - particle ) . all other particle characteristics , such as helicities ,",
    "are counted extra .",
    "the total number of the degrees of freedom in the gas , i.e. counting particles and anti - particles separately , will be given by    @xmath153    the total energy of the holostar solution is given by the proper integral over the mass density .",
    "the proper energy of the shell therefore is :    @xmath154    setting the two energies equal gives the local temperature within the holostar :    @xmath155    thus we recover the @xmath93-dependence of the local temperature , at least if @xmath148 is constant .",
    "@xmath148 is a function of @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath144 .",
    "we will see later , that @xmath144 only depends on the ratio of @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "therefore in any range of @xmath22-values where the number of degrees of freedom of the ultra - relativistic particles ( or rather their ratio ) does nt change , the local temperature as determined by equation ( [ eq : tloctherm ] ) will not deviate from an inverse square root law .    if the temperature of equation ( [ eq : tloctherm ] ) is inserted into equation ( [ eq : pf ] ) , the thermodynamic pressure is derived as follows :    @xmath156    this is the equation of state for an ultra - relativistic gas , as expected .      by inserting the temperature derived in equation ( [ eq : tloctherm ] ) into equation ( [ eq : sf ] ) we get the following expression for the thermodynamic entropy within the shell :    @xmath157    with    @xmath158 \\right ) + 2 f_b \\frac{4}{3 }   \\left ( z_{b,3}(0 ) \\right)\\ ] ]    we have used commutator [ ] and anti - commutator \\ { } notation in order to render the above relation somewhat more compact .    using the identities for the polylog function it is possible to express the above relation as a quadratic function of the variable @xmath159 .",

    "the temperature of the holostar at infinity is given by    @xmath213    again , if we set @xmath207 we get the hawking temperature .",
    "the important result is , that @xmath206 could in principle take on any arbitrary ( nearly constant ) value .",
    "this is possible , because the factor in the temperature is just the inverse as the factor in the entropy .",
    "as is well known from black hole physics , any constant rescaling of the hawking entropy must necessarily rescale the temperature such , that the product of temperature and entropy is equal for the scaled and unscaled quantities , i.e. @xmath214 must be unaffected by the rescaling .",
    "this is necessary , because otherwise the thermodynamic identity    @xmath215    would not be fulfilled in the exterior space - time .",

    "furthermore , entropy and temperature at infinity are exactly proportional to the hawking temperature and entropy .",

    "although hawking s calculations are robust @xcite and there appears to be no reason , why the hawking equation should be modified - at least for large black holes - it has been speculated whether the factor in the entropy - area law ( or in the temperature formula ) might take a different value .",
    "a single measurement of the hawking temperature ( or entropy ) of a large black hole could settle the question .",
    "however , with no black hole available in our immediate vicinity and taking into account the extremely low temperatures of even comparatively small black holes , there appeared to be no feasible means to measure the hawking entropy or temperature of a black hole directly or indirectly .",
    "it would be of high theoretical value , if the hawking temperature / entropy formula could be verified ( or falsified ) by an explicit measurement .",
    "the holostar provides such a means .    for this purpose",
    "let us assume , that the hawking temperature formula were modified by a constant factor , i.e    @xmath221    where @xmath206 is a dimensionless factor , whose value can be determined experimentally .",
    "if we set the temperature of the holostar equal to the modified hawking temperature we get the following result for @xmath148 :    @xmath222    the local temperature within the holostar is then given by equation ( [ eq : tloctherm ] ) :    @xmath223    @xmath224 is the total ( local ) energy density of the matter within the holostar .",
    "the above equation can be solved for @xmath206 :    @xmath225    the local radiation temperature @xmath114 and the total local energy density @xmath18 within a holostar are both accessible to measurement .",
    "note that the local temperature within a holostar is much easier to measure than its ( hawking ) temperature at infinity : the local interior temperature only scales with @xmath226 , whereas the temperature at infinity scales with @xmath227 .",

    "the following formula for @xmath78 has been suggested :    @xmath228    @xmath229 is the running value of the fine - structure constant , which depends on the local energy scale .",
    "note that the above relation for @xmath78 has not been derived rigorously in @xcite , but was suggested by analogy , i.e. by extrapolating the ( exact ) relation between mass , charge , boundary area and @xmath15 derived for an extremely charged holostar to the charged / rotating case .",
    "angular momentum was introduced in straightforward way , giving the correct formula for a kerr - newman black hole in the macroscopic limit and the correct formula for the a charged , non - rotating holostar for @xmath230 .",
    "the formula with non - zero @xmath231 then was applied to a _",
    "microscopic _ object , a spin-1/2 extremely charged holostar of minimal mass , in order to obtain equation ( [ eq : beta : running ] ) .",
    "one must keep in mind though , that in principle there are several ways to extend the formula to the rotating case giving the correct macroscopic limit , but which might differ in their microscopic predictions .",
    "we want to apply equation ( [ eq : beta : running ] ) in order to derive the value of @xmath15 which determines the _ interior _ radial metric coefficient of a large holostar , @xmath232 .",
    "the implicit assumption which lies at the heart of equation ( [ eq : beta : running ] ) , is that @xmath233 is a _ universal _",
    "quantity , not dependent on the nature of the system in question and only - moderately - dependent on the energy - scale .",
    "it requires quite a leap of faith to do this .",
    "it is not possible to fully justify this assumption in the context of this paper .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed discussion .    due to the appearance of @xmath229 in the formula for @xmath37 it is suggestive to interpret @xmath15 as a running length scale , which depends on the energy @xmath216 via @xmath234 .",
    "this means that for high temperatures @xmath15 is expected to increase with energy as a function of @xmath234 .",
    "this makes sense , because we have already seen , that @xmath37 is proportional to the effective degrees of freedom , which are also known to increase at high energies .",
    "therefore , if we treat @xmath37 as a universal quantity , the only sensible way is to interpret @xmath229 as the running value of the relevant coupling constants depending on the energy scale .    with this interpretation ,",
    "whenever @xmath229 is small , such as for the typical energies encountered today , it can be set to zero in the above equation to a very good approximation , so that @xmath235 .",
    "let us now make the assumption , that we live in a large holostar . in @xcite several observational facts",
    "have been accumulated which suggest that such a claim is not too far fetched .",
    "then the local radiation temperature will be nothing else than the microwave - background temperature and the total ( local ) energy density will be the total matter density of the universe at the present time (= present radial position ) .",
    "both quantities have been determined quite precisely in the recent past . with the following value for the temperature of the microwave background radiation    @xmath236    and with the total matter density determined from the recent wmap - measurements @xcite    @xmath237    and with @xmath78 determined from equation ( [ eq : beta : running ] ) using the present ( low energy ) value of the fine - structure constant , @xmath229 ,    @xmath238",
    "we find :    @xmath239    or    @xmath240    if we set the fine - structure constant to zero , i.e. @xmath241 , the agreement is almost as good : @xmath242 .",
    "the very high accuracy suggested in the above results is somewhat deceptive . with @xmath114",
    "known to roughly 0.1% the error in @xmath206 will be dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath18 . a conservative estimate for this uncertainty",
    "should be roughly 5% .",

    "therefore , within the uncertainties of the determination of @xmath18 and @xmath114 the hawking - entropy formula is reproduced to a remarkably high degree of accuracy of roughly 1% .",
    "not knowing @xmath78 , the experimental data only allow us to determine @xmath243 .",
