    "is there any weighted analogue of young s inequality ?",
    "3 .   can young s inequality be improved ?",
    "f. cunningham jr .",
    "and n. grossman @xcite noticed that the question ( q1 ) has a positive answer ( correcting the prevalent belief that young s inequality is the business of strictly increasing continuous functions ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend the entire discussion to the framework of locally absolutely continuous measures and to prove several improvements .",
    "as well known , young s inequality is an illustration of the legendre duality .",
    "precisely , the functions@xmath7 are both continuous and convex on @xmath8 and ( [ youngineq ] ) can be restated as@xmath9 with equality if and only if @xmath10 because of the equality case , the formula ( [ youngineq2 ] ) leads to the following connection between the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12@xmath13 and @xmath14    it turns out that each of these formulas produces a convex function ( possibly on a different interval ) .",

    "necessarily @xmath18 is an non - empty interval and @xmath19 is a convex function whose level sets @xmath20 are closed subsets of @xmath21 for each @xmath22 ( usually such functions are called _ closed _ convex functions ) .",
    "a convex function may not be differentiable , but it admits a good substitute for differentiability .",
    "the _ _ subdifferential  _ _ of a real function _ _  _ _ @xmath11 defined on an interval @xmath15 is a multivalued function @xmath23 defined by@xmath24    geometrically , the subdifferential gives us the slopes of the supporting lines for the graph of @xmath11 .",
    "the subdifferential at a point _ _  _ _ is always a convex set , possibly empty , but the convex functions @xmath25 have the remarkable property that @xmath26 at all interior points .",

    "now it becomes clear that young s inequality should work outside strict monotonicity ( as well as outside continuity ) .",
    "the details are presented in section 2 .",
    "our approach ( based on the geometric meaning of integrals as areas ) allows us to extend the framework of integrability to all positive measures @xmath54 which are locally absolutely continuous with respect to the planar lebesgue measure @xmath55 .",
