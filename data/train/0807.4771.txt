    "the formation and observation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy ion collisions are important goals of modern nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "suppression of high @xmath0 hadron yields  @xcite is one of the most important features observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) .",
    "theoretically this is attributed to the interaction between jets ( hard partons ) and the bulk matter @xcite . experimentally , absence of the suppression in @xmath2au collisions  @xcite reveals that the suppression results from a final - state effect and , in turn , that the hot and dense matter is created in au+au collisions .",
    "the amount of suppression depends significantly on the centrality of the collision @xcite , which implies various sizes of hot dense matter are formed in heavy ion collisions at various centralities .",
    "this offers us an excellent opportunity to study the interaction of partons inside the system and , consequently , properties of the matter under extreme conditions .",
    "hadron production in heavy ion collisions involves bulk hadronization of the thermal partons at low @xmath0 , the fragmentation of quenched hard partons at high @xmath0 and the hadronization contributed from both thermal and hard partons at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is quite difficult to systematically describe all these hadronization processes since some of them are beyond the perturbative treatment and usually contain many parameters without full understanding .",
    "low @xmath0 hadrons also strongly interact with each other after hadronization and can not carry _ direct _ information from inside the hot matter . under this situation ,",
    "a systematic study of direct photons in a wide range of transverse momentum and centrality can serve as a guide to understand the whole reaction processes of heavy ion collisions , since we do not need to treat hadronization itself nor interaction between produced direct photons and the bulk matter thanks to the large mean free path of direct photons compared to the typical size of the system in heavy ion collisions .",
    "competition among different sources at various centralities may be also useful in understanding of production mechanism of direct photons .    in this paper ,",
    "we first study the role of jet quenching on the centrality dependence of direct photon production . for this purpose , a reliable treatment of hard parton energy loss",
    "is needed .",
    "this is formulated via the bdmps framework @xcite and tested on pion suppression at various centralities . since neutral pions and other mesons are significantly suppressed in central au+au collisions , and",
    "since the suppression has an evident centrality dependence , the following question arises naturally : what is the role of hard parton energy loss on direct photon production ?",
    "main purpose of this paper is to answer this question .",
    "we also investigate the interplay among the various sources of direct photons .",
    "similar to hadron suppression , photons from parton fragmentation are expected to offer information on the interaction between hard partons and the bulk via jet quenching .",
    "thermal photons and photons from parton - bulk interactions are penetrating probes of the hot matter , respectively , through interaction of partons inside bulk matter and interaction between primary partons and the bulk matter .",
    "it is interesting to see whether one reproduces the observed photon spectra by considering all photon sources simultaneously and consistently at different collision centralities . by identifying the dominant sources of direct photons at given values of @xmath0",
    ", we will be able to discuss in which way the different @xmath0-regions of the photon spectra provide information about the different production processes .",
    "we need a realistic description of the hot and dense matter to investigate the effect of bulk matter on photon emission .",
    "this is achieved by using three dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamic simulations of bulk matter @xcite which have already been tested against a vast body of low @xmath0 hadron data at rhic .    to perform a systematic study of _ direct",
    "_ photon production ( from sources other than neutral meson decays ) in relativistic heavy ion collisions , we shortly review the possible sources in the following .    *",
    "_ primordial nn scattering .",
    "_ * the direct photon production via compton scattering and quark - antiquark annihilation can be calculated in perturbation theory using the conventional parton distribution functions and the factorization hypothesis . in principle",
    "one should consider at this stage also higher order contributions , like bremsstrahlung of photons accompanying for example two - jet production in hard parton - parton scattering .",
    "however , we consider this component as a part of the so - called jet fragmentation ( or bremsstrahlung ) contribution to be affected by the thermalized matter , which we will discuss separately .    *",
    "_ thermal photons .",
    "* in high energy nuclear collisions , the density of secondary partons is so high that the quarks and gluons rescatter and eventually thermalize to form a bubble of hot qgp .",
    "the plasma expands , cools down , and goes through a phase transition to hadronic gas ( hg ) phase .",
    "thermal photons can be produced during the whole history of the evolution of hot matter from the qgp phase to the hg phase through the mixed phase due to collisions of or radiations from thermalized particles .",
    "yields of photons from a thermal source are exponentially damped so that contribution to very high @xmath0 region is negligible .",
    "however , contribution to low @xmath0 is expected to be dominant in central collisions in which the size and the temperature of a hot and dense matter are large enough .",
    "* _ jet - photon conversion . _ * when hard partons pass through thermalized matter , they may interact .",
    "collisions between jets and deconfined partons via quark - antiquark annihilation and quark - gluon compton scattering can produce direct photons .",
    "this is often called as jet - photon conversion .",
    "* _ jet fragmentation . _",
    "* photon production also occurs as a higher order effect in purely partonic initial hard scatterings : at any stages of the evolution of a jet ( final state parton emission ) , there is a possibility of emitting photons .",
    "existence of a qgp again affects the results of fragmented photons since energetic partons lose their energy prior to fragmentation . in this work , we assume fragmentation of partons only outside the plasma , which is similar to high @xmath0 hadron production from jet fragmentation .",
    "there are possible contributions to photon production which are not included in the present study : the medium - induced radiation is supposed to be a higher order contribution . at the rhic energy this contributes much less than jet photon conversion at low and intermediate @xmath0 and much less than fragmentation at high @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "so the contribution from medium - induced radiation is ignored this paper . in the time interval between the primordial collisions at @xmath3 and the thermalization of the hot matter at @xmath4 ,",
    "the interaction between non - equilibrated soft partons and hard partons may also produce direct photons .",
    "we neglect the contribution in the preequilibrium stage since the time interval is much shorter than the life time of the equilibrated matter ( @xmath5 fm/@xmath6 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "so a realistic description of reaction dynamics is indispensable for the quantitative analysis of photon production . in our calculation , fully three - dimensional ( 3d ) ideal hydrodynamics @xcite is employed to describe the space - time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in au+au collisions at rhic energy at various centralities .",

    "the three curves are respectively 0 - 10% ( dotted line ) , 20 - 30% ( solid line ) , and 40 - 50% ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "@xmath1 has a weak centrality dependence at high @xmath0 region .",
    "this result is consistent with the observed phenomenon  @xcite that the @xmath0-integrated ( for @xmath177  gev/@xmath6 ) @xmath1 of direct photons is almost independent of collision centrality .",
    "does this imply a very weak effect from jet quenching ?",
    "figure  [ fig : raa3](b ) answers this question ( here for the most central collisions ) : comparing calculations with ( dotted line ) and without energy loss ( solid line ) , one finds a difference of up to 40% .",
    "so the effect of parton energy loss is quite visible in the @xmath0 range between @xmath178 gev/@xmath6 and more than @xmath179 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "if we would do the @xmath1 calculations without energy loss , the difference between central and semiperipheral collisions would be about 20% , wheras the complete calculation gives the same result for all centralities , within 5% .",
    "we have to admit that we talk about small effects , requiring experimental data with relative errors of less than 5to observe the effects .        to understand the above results , we look more closely into the different contributions . parton energy loss in the plasma suppresses the fragmentation contributions and jet - photon conversion .",
    "so we study the ratios of the contribution with energy loss to the one without energy loss , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eloss ] ( ( a ) for fragmentation and ( b ) for jet - photon conversion ) . energy loss in the plasma depends on the path length of the hard parton inside the plasma , which turns out to depend on the collision centrality .",
    "we do see a similar centrality dependence of the suppression for @xmath112 ( jet quenching effect ) in fragmentation contributions and jet - photon conversion .    to understand how these energy loss features affect the total contribution",
    ", we investigate the competition from different sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : cent2b ] , for the three centralities 0 - 10% , 20 - 30% , and 40 - 50% .",
    "the leading order contribution ( lo ) from primordial elementary scatterings is plotted as dotted lines , thermal contribution as dash - dotted lines , fragmentation contribution as dashed lines , and jet photon conversion as solid lines .",
    "the latter two are calculated with parton energy loss in the plasma ( left plots ) and without ( right ) .",
    "for all centralities , thermal photons dominate at low transverse momenta and they are insignificant in the high @xmath0 region . the leading order contribution from primordial elementary scatterings dominates in the high @xmath0 region .",
    "this contribution is independent of bulk volume .",
    "let us first discuss the central collisions . here",
    "fragmentation and conversion are an order of magnitude smaller that the lo contribution .",
    "but from fig .",
    "[ fig : cent2b ] , we know that is due to the strong energy loss effect . without this energy loss , these two contributions would be much bigger , and this is why we find a 40% difference between the total contribution with and without energy loss .        for peripheral collisions , without energy loss ,",
    "the relative contribution from conversion is smaller compared to central scatterings , since the the plasma regions is smaller .",
    "but then also the suppression from energy loss is smaller for the peripheral compared to central collisions .",
    "so at the end , including a proper energy loss treatment , for both central and peripheral collisions , conversion is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the lo contribution , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cent2b](e ) .",
    "the relative contribution from fragmentation , without energy loss , is comparable in central and peripheral collisions , however , the energy loss is smaller in the latter ones .",
    "so fragmentation is somewhat more important in peripheral compared to central , when energy loss is considered , as can be also seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : eloss2 ] , where the contribution to @xmath1 from fragmentation and conversion is shown for the different centralities : conversion contributes roughly 4% , for all centralities , fragmentation between 5% ( central ) and 10% ( peripheral ) .    at the end",
    ", @xmath1 is nearly centrality independent as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : raa3](a ) , but a realistic ( and strong ) partonic energy loss is needed in order to get this scaling behavior .            in the low @xmath0 region , contribution from thermal radiation is of significant importance .",
    "we check the centrality - dependence of the thermal contribution to @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ther ]  ( a ) . at very low @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath106 , @xmath180 1  gev/@xmath6 , the thermal contributions to @xmath1 at different centralities coincide with each other .",
    "however the slope of @xmath181 changes and the dominant @xmath0 region of thermal photons becomes smaller when one moves from central to peripheral collisions .",
    "this reflects the fact that the temperature in the core region depends on the collision centrality as shown in table [ table : initialt ] in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "so from the thermal source , the @xmath1 for central collisions exceed more and more the @xmath1 for peripheral collisions , which translates into a slight overshooting of the central total @xmath1 compared to the peripheral one , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : eloss ] , in the region @xmath180 4  gev/@xmath6 .    the fractions of thermal contribution as a function of @xmath0 from different phases are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ther ]  ( b ) .",
    "partial chemical equilibrium in the hadronic phase is used in this hydrodynamic simulation to keep the number of hadrons fixed below @xmath38 . if we ignore the contribution from particle decays and use a full chemical equilibrium ( fce ) , the photon emission rate from hadronic phase @xcite can be used in this case . in case of the pce , the chemical potential @xmath182 for all hadronic species @xmath32 will modify the photon emission rate from hadronic gas , roughly estimated by a factor of @xmath183 $ ] for a subprocess of @xmath184 according to kinetic theory with a maxwell - boltzmann statistics for all particles .",
    "this factor finally increases contribution from the hg with a factor about 2 .",
    "nevertheless , in the total thermal contribution , pce or fce consideration does not make a visible difference .",
    "for all centralities from 0 - 10% to 50 - 60% , the qgp phase emits most of direct photons above @xmath1851  gev/@xmath6 .",
    "although the volume of hadronic phase is much bigger than the one of the qgp phase due to expansion , the photon emission rate from the hadronic phase decreases even faster with temperature .",
    "the competition between volume and emission rate results in the biggest contribution from the qgp phase at @xmath186  gev/@xmath6 . in the current setting of hydrodynamic simulations at the rhic energy , the mixed phase exists for a very long time ( @xmath187 fm/@xmath6 ) .",
    "this contributes mostly at lower @xmath0 values . by combining the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : cent2b ] and [ fig : ther ] , contribution of thermal radiation from the qgp phase is dominant in the region @xmath188 gev/@xmath6 .",
    "this momentum window may provide information inside the hot and dense matter , e.g. , the initial temperature at the center , which may not be reached directly by hadron spectra .",
    "we calculated the centrality - dependence of @xmath0 spectra for direct photons in au+au collisions at the rhic energy , based on a realistic data - constrained ( 3 + 1)-d hydrodynamic description of the expanding hot and dense matter , a reasonable treatment of propagation of partons and their energy loss , and a systematic consideration of main sources of direct photons . in this study , four main sources are considered , namely , leading order ( lo ) contribution from primordial elementary scatterings , thermal radiation from the fluids , fragmentation from hard partons , and jet photon conversion ( jpc ) .",
    "similar work  @xcite has been done before the appearence of the most recent data  @xcite .",
    "our results agree nicely with the recent low @xmath0 data .",
    "the role of jet quenching in the high @xmath0 region of direct photons production has been checked via fragmentation photons and jet photon conversion sources .",
    "for these two sources , the suppression of the photon rate due to parton energy loss is significant in central au+au collisions , and becomes less important towards peripheral collisions , similar to the suppression for meson production .",
    "since experimentally one may separate isolated photons ( lo+jpc ) and associate photons ( fragmentation photons ) , our prediction may be tested in the future .    considering the total yields of direct photons ,",
    "the contribution from fragmentation and conversion are small , contributing between 5% and 10% .",
    "however , parton energy loss plays nevertheless an important role : without it , these second order effects would contribute significantly . without jet quenching , the nuclear modification factors @xmath1 would depend visibly on the centrality of the collisions .",
    "a strong energy loss is actually necessary to get the centrality scaling of @xmath1 in our calculation  a centrality scaling which has observed by the phenix collaboration . in this sense",
    ", properties of the bulk matter affect the photon yields at intermediate values of @xmath0 , via the parton energy loss .",
    "the low @xmath0 region is totally dominated by thermal radiation , providing direct information about the bulk matter .",
    "we find that @xmath1 of photons at @xmath0 values below 1  gev/@xmath6 is centrality independent .",
    "with increasing @xmath0 , the @xmath1 for peripheral collisions drops much faster than the one for central scatterings . on the other hand , thermal photons",
    "are mainly emitted from the qgp phase at @xmath1891  gev / c even though the mixed phase and the hg phase occupy bigger space and longer time .",
    "so the different behavior of @xmath1 for central and peripheral collisions , in the range 1  gev/@xmath1903  gev/@xmath6 , manifests the fact that the plasma in central collisions is hotter compared to peripheral collisions .",
    "still more investigation are needed for a precise characterization of the properties of the plasma via thermal photons . besides",
    ", the elliptic flow of direct photons ( especially thermal photons ) should provide more information of the plasma , which will be discussed elsewhere .",
