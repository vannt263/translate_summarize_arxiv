    "when an electron bunch undergoes a motion under the influence of external forces , the particles within the bunch become sources of self - fields which are different from the static case and which obey the usual lienard - wiechert expressions .",
    "these self - fields feed back on the particle dynamics , which often makes the description of the evolution of the system a problem without easy solution .",
    "many electrodynamical systems fit in the latter description . in all these systems one can recognize two separate aspects in the evolution issue : a dynamical one , which is governed by the equation of motion , and an electrodynamical one , which is taken care of by maxwell equations .",
    "the solution to the evolution problem is obtained when one is able to solve simultaneously both equations : this is , for example , what self - consistent computer codes strive for .",
    "an example of such self - consistent , numerical solutions is given ( see @xcite ) by the program trafic@xmath3 ( which will be employed in this paper to provide cross - checks with analytical results ) .",
    "although trafic@xmath3 and other codes are able to provide quite reliable results for a number of evolution problems , a separate study of their dynamical and electrodynamical aspects , which can be achieved by means of theoretical analysis , is necessary in order to get a good understanding of the physics involved , and to provide benchmark and cross - checks for simulations ( and , at an earlier stage , to build correct simulations too ) .",
    "moreover , it often happens that this kind of theoretical analysis can be directly applied in order to get good practical solutions for the problem at least in a narrow region of the parameters which specify the system setup .",
    "the results can , then , be used for quick estimations of the magnitude of the effects under investigation .",
    "let us restrict our attention to the case of self - fields within an ultrarelativistic electron bunch driven by external forces of magnetic nature .",
    "the self - interaction in the longitudinal direction ( parallel , at any time , to the velocity vector by definition ) is responsible for the energy exchange between the system and the acceleration field and for all csr ( coherent synchrotron radiation)-related phenomena , which have been studied extensively elsewhere ( see , among the others , @xcite ...",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "these investigations are important in view of the need for very high - peak current , low emittance beams for self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase)-free - electron - lasers operating in the x - ray region ( see , among the others , @xcite ) .",
    "similar beams are also being considered for production of femtosecond radiation pulses by simpler schemes based on cherenkov and transition radiation @xcite : production and utilization of such kind of beams may prove difficult due to self - field collective effects . indeed , these effects may spoil the required high brightness of the electron beam , which is a matter of major concern among people involved this kind of physics research .",
    "the study of self - forces in the transverse direction is important for the same reasons .",
    "they were first addressed , in the case of a circular motion , and from an electrodynamical viewpoint , in @xcite .",
    "further analysis ( @xcite , @xcite ... @xcite ) consider , again , the case of circular motion both from an electrodynamical and a dynamical viewpoint and in the approximation of a rigid bunch : at the time being , existing theoretical analysis of transverse self - forces deal with the case of circular orbit only , without considering transient collective phenomena .    in this paper",
    "we propose a fully electrodynamical analysis of transverse self - fields originating , at the position of a test particle , from an ultrarelativistic electron bunch moving in an arc of a circle , thus treating for the first time , besides the basic situation of circular motion , also the case of transient between a straight line and a hard - edge magnet ( and , vice versa , from a bend to a straight line ) .",
    "consistently with the choice to analyze the electrodynamical aspect of the problem only , a zero energy - spread will be understood when considering the evolution of an electron bunch . as underlined before ,",
    "although the results obtained can be directly applied , from a practical viewpoint , only in the case in which the zero energy - spread hypothesis is verified _ a posteriori _ , the outcomes of this paper are important to get a good insight if the physics of the problem , and to provide benchmark and cross - checks for simulations .",
    "firstly , a two - particle model is adopted in order to study the transverse force produced by a single particle , and then , by summing up all the contributions from different electrons , the case of a line - bunch model characterized by a rectangular density distribution is analyzed : this can , in fact , be easily generalized to the case of an arbitrary density distribution .",
    "besides providing results in the case of a finite hard - edge bending magnet , our approach turns also useful in order to get a better insight of the physics involved in the case of simple circular motion .",
    "moreover , our results give us a better understanding ( although one has to take into account , here , dynamical aspects as well as electrodynamical ones ) of the partial compensation between transverse self - force and gradient of the potential energy deviation from the nominal value .",
    "we will discuss the limits of applicability of our model , with respect to the transverse beam size , @xmath4 , in section [ sec : steadybunch ] ) . within such applicability limits",
    ", we find results which are independent of the bunch transverse dimension .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the transverse interaction between two electrons moving on a circle , together with a simple dynamical interpretation is treated in section [ sec : steadytwo ] . in section [ sec : steadybunch ] , we deal with a stepped - profile electron bunch interacting with a test particle again on a circle , and discuss also the applicability region of the line model .",
    "transient behavior ( from straight to circular path and vice versa ) for the transverse self - forces between two particles are then studied in section [ sec : transientwo ] .",
    "results for the transient of a stepped - profile bunch are given in section [ sec : transientbunch ] , where a treatment for the case of a more generic bunch density is also proposed .",
    "a regularization technique for cancelling the singularity in the expression for the transverse force ( which always arises in the limit of a near - zero distance between test particle and sources ) is then applied . in section [ sec : cancel ] we will deal with the well - known issue of the partial compensation of transverse self - force .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] , we come to a summary of the obtained results and to conclusions .",
    "let us begin our study considering the steady case of two electrons moving on a circle of radius @xmath5 .",

    "this hypothesis will naturally lead , further on , to the assumption of a zero energy - spread when one considers the evolution of an electron bunch , and , as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , it is consistent with our choice to analyze only the electrodynamical aspect of the problem . upon this",
    "we can write eq .",

    "( [ coultrig ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ radtrig ] ) to the second non - vanishing order in @xmath27 thus obtaining    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    where we define @xmath34 and @xmath35 as    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    here and above @xmath38 .",
    "this normalization choice , already treated in @xcite , is quite natural , @xmath39 being the synchrotron radiation formation - angle at the critical wavelength . in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ coulexp ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ radexp ] ) ( and in the following , too ) we understood @xmath40 , which is again justified by the ultrarelativistic approximation .",
    "moreover , it is important to realize that the assumption @xmath41 is by no means a restrictive one , since it keeps open the possibility of comparing @xmath27 with the formation angle @xmath39 ( note that a deflection angle smaller or bigger than @xmath39 is characteristic of the cases , respectively , of undulator or synchrotron radiation ) .",
    "the following expression can be then trivially derived , which is valid for the total transverse force felt by the test particle @xmath42 where @xmath43 is defined by    @xmath44    note that eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) is completely independent of the parameters of the system : it is then straightforward to study the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath43 . in order to do so",
    ", just remember that the retardation condition linking @xmath26 and @xmath27 is given by ( see @xcite )    @xmath45    or its approximated form    @xmath46    it is now evident that @xmath47 when @xmath48 and @xmath49 when @xmath50 , having introduced the normalized quantity @xmath51 .",
    "this normalization choice is linked to the fact that the critical synchrotron radiation wavelength , @xmath52 , is also the minimal characteristic distance of our system : two particles nearer than such a distance can be considered as a single one radiating , up to the critical frequency , with charge @xmath53 ( see @xcite ) .    the asymptotic behavior above suggests to study the function @xmath54 .",
    "we plotted such a function in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( together with the radiative contribution alone ) for values of @xmath55 running from 0 to 5 .",

    "the dashed line shows the radiative contribution @xmath59 alone.,width=340 ]    it is interesting to underline the fact that , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the transverse force is always centrifugal , for any distance between the two particles . this fact can be explained by means of a simple relativistic argument which holds , qualitatively , for all particle distances : in order to build the two - particle system , i.e. to bring them together , one needs to work against the electromagnetic field .",
    "then , the total mass of the system accounts for this interaction energy too , and is therefore bigger than the simple sum of the particles masses .",
    "hence , also the equilibrium orbit radius must be bigger than @xmath5 , and a centrifugal self - force is to be expected .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that @xmath35 has the same asymptotic behavior as @xmath43 , and that @xmath34 gives important contributions to @xmath43 only for values between the two asymptotes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this may find intuitive explanation in the following reasoning . as is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) , the velocity field of an ultrarelativistic electron is radial , with respect to the `` virtual '' position which the particle would assume if it moved with constant velocity starting from the retarded point , but the line forces are not isotropically distributed , and resemble more and more the plane wave configuration as @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the test particle is influenced by the velocity field of the source particle only when such a field `` shines right on the test electron '' ( quoted from @xcite ) , which does not happen for asymptotic values of @xmath61 .",
    "let us now analyze , in the framework of our line model , the case in which the source particle is in front of the test particle .",
    "the geometry is qualitatively sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "geometry for the two - particle system in the steady state situation , with the source particle ahead of the test one .",
    "here t is the present position of the test particle , s is the present position of the source , while s indicates the retarded position of the source.,width=317 ]    the difference with respect to the situation in which the test electron is in front of the source is that the test electron `` runs against '' the electromagnetic signal emitted by the source , while in the other case it just `` runs away '' from it .",
    "therefore the relative velocity between the signal and the test electron is equal to @xmath62 , instead of @xmath63 in the other situation",
    ". hence the retardation condition reads    @xmath64    or , solved for @xmath27 in its approximated form ,    @xmath65    in this situation , @xmath66 is almost parallel to ( and equal to ) @xmath22 and antiparallel to @xmath67 : it turns out that the only important contribution to the transverse force is given by the second term on the right side of eq .",
    "( [ radiation ] ) , and it is easy to check that    @xmath68    it may be worthwhile to underline that the force in eq .",
    "( [ fperpht ] ) is , evidently , of the same magnitude as the force in eq .",
    "( [ totexp ] ) .    as a note to the entire steady - state case discussion ,",
    "let us provide an interpretation for the electromagnetic transverse forces from the viewpoint of relativistic dynamics in the limit @xmath69 .",
    "in such a situation the two electrons are near enough to consider them travelling with the same velocity vector .",
    "one can , then , analyze the situation in the rest frame of the two - particle system . by means of a lorentz transformation",
    ", one can find that the total momentum of the system in the laboratory frame and in the direction of motion ( let us call it _",
    "z_-direction ) , is given by ( see @xcite ) :    @xmath70    where the integration ( in eq .",
    "( [ totmom ] ) and below ) is performed over all space . here",
    "@xmath71 is the electron rest mass , @xmath72 is the electromagnetic interaction energy of the system and @xmath73 is the component of the electromagnetic stress tensor corresponding to the flux of the _ z_-component of the total momentum along the _ z _ direction .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that we do not have to include @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( corresponding anyway to momentum flux in the z - direction ) in the calculation of @xmath76 because they are antisymmetric in @xmath77 ( as well as in the other two directions , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , individuated by the tensor indexes @xmath57 and @xmath80 ) , thus giving a vanishing integral contribution .",
    "all the quantities between round brackets are calculated in the system rest frame .",
    "on the other hand , the total energy of the system turns out to be ( see , again , @xcite ) : @xmath81 where , again , the quantities between round brackets are calculated in the system rest frame .",
    "it is now easy to calculate @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the rest frame .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction energy is given by the work done against the field to bring the two particles together from a situation in which they are separated by an infinite distance :    @xmath82    in order to calculate @xmath73 , we can consider the electrostatic stress tensor alone because in the rest frame , at short distance @xmath83 , the radiative field contributions are unimportant and , on the other hand , the external magnetic field has zero component along the direction of motion .",
    "now , the electrostatic stress tensor is given by    @xmath84    where _ i _ , _ j _ = 1 ... 3 .",
    "for us , the only interesting component is    @xmath85    it can be proven that    @xmath86    now , the equations for the momentum and the energy of the system in the laboratory frame read : @xmath87 and @xmath88~. \\label{lasttoten}\\ ] ] from the transverse component of the equation of motion for the system one gets    @xmath89    which justifies eq .",
    "( [ fperpht ] ) and the asymptotic behavior for short distance between the particles of eq .",
    "( [ totexp ] ) .",
    "the discussion above underlines the fact that , in order to get a correct dynamical interpretation of the electrodynamical transverse forces on the two particles , one needs to account for the self - interaction energy and momentum flux of the system . nevertheless , by doing this , one can easily find that the energy of our system ( divided by @xmath10 ) and its momentum do not constitute a four - vector anymore , as it is seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ totmom ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ toten ] ) . at the beginning of the 20th century",
    "a similar problem was encountered by people trying to build a classical model of the electron : in that case , the solution was the introduction of the poincar stress tensor ( see , among others , @xcite or @xcite ) , which granted stability to the system and recovered covariance for the energy - momentum pair . as said in @xcite : `` it is not unreasonable then to include poincar stresses in our classical models of charged particles , or at least to remember that care must be taken in discussion of purely electromagnetic aspects of such models '' . in our case",
    "we deal with a completely electrodynamical system , so that there is no straightforward way to introduce the analogue of poincar stresses : nevertheless one must take care and remember that , within our accuracy , energy and momentum are no longer forming a four - vector . it might be worthwhile to underline the fact that , in modern physics of particle acceleration , problems which have been of pure academic importance for about one hundred years are now becoming of practical importance .",
    "in this section we discuss the transverse force felt by an electron due to the interaction with a line bunch ( with rectangular density distribution ) moving in a circle .",
    "the geometry is described in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , and will be considered rigid , i.e. fixed during the entire evolution of the system .",
    "this fact means that we will have zero energy - spread inside our bunch and this is in agreement with our model choice in section [ sec : steadytwo ] and our program of a pure electrodynamical analysis , without dynamical aspects .    before beginning actual calculations ,",
    "we provide here a discussion about the applicability region of our line model . in the case of contributions from particles behind the test particle ,",
    "the region of applicability of the line model follows straightforwardly from the retardation condition : one can easily check that the inclusion of a transverse dimension of the bunch , already designated with @xmath4 in section [ sec : intro ] , adds to eq .",
    "( [ retsteadyappr ] ) the term of magnitude @xmath90 .",
    "such a term is negligible with respect to the others in the retardation condition , whenever @xmath91 , which specifies the region of applicability of our model as regards the transverse bunch size .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when one considers contributions from electrons in front of the test particle .",
    "in fact , in the case @xmath92 ( source particle in front ) and @xmath93 , we have a situation in which the test electron overtakes the source before it is reached by the electromagnetic signal : this means that , even if the test particle is behind the source , the present position of the test particle is , anyway , in front of the retarded position of the source . then , it is possible to show that the line model constitutes a valid description of the situation only when @xmath94 .",
    "the cases that do not verify such a condition are left for future study .",
    "schematic of the test electron t and the stepped - profile bunch ; @xmath95 indicates the distance between the electron and the head of the bunch ; @xmath96 is the sum of the bunch length and @xmath97,width=340 ]    now , in order to actually evaluate the transverse electromagnetic force which the bunch exercises on the test particle one has to sum up the contributions from all the retarded sources . since the two - particle interaction has been calculated in section [ sec : steadytwo ] as a function of the retarded angle @xmath27 , it is convenient to switch the integration variable from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ,    @xmath98    being the jacobian of the transformation .",

    ". generally speaking , if there was _ complete _ compensation between the _ total _ transverse force and the @xmath259-term , then the particles with the same total energy ( assumed equal to the sum of kinetic energy and potential self - energy from the bunch ) would have followed the same trajectory .",
    "such a complete cancellation would be based upon two assumptions .",
    "firstly , @xmath261 and , secondly , @xmath262 . note that , in this case , @xmath263 .",
    "this , of course , is not the case , since the cancellation has always been understood for the centrifugal term alone ( and , anyway , it is not complete ) .",
    "moreover let us remind that , as explained in section [ sec : steadybunch ] , there is no physical ground to distinguish between the centripetal term and the centrifugal one : from a physical viewpoint there is just an overall centrifugal force .",
    "a further subdivision is just of mathematical nature , and explains how the transverse force plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] behaves from one asymptotic ( short distance between test and source particle ) to the other ( large distance between test and source particle ) .",
    "this fact , alone , suggests that the cancellation issue has no general validity and that , indeed , it is artificial ( as the subdivision between centripetal and centrifugal term is ) even when it works , like in the case of a coasting beam in a simple , circular steady - state motion .    nevertheless , let us retain , in our terminology , the distinction between centripetal and centrifugal term .",
    "then , a _ complete _ cancellation between _ centrifugal _ force and potential term would be based , similarly as before , upon two facts .",
    "firstly , @xmath264 and , secondly , @xmath265 , at any time .",
    "whenever one of these assumptions is no more verified , the cancellation fails to happen .    of course",
    ", in order to show that the cancellation effect is not valid in general , it is sufficient to provide a counter - example .",
    "let us consider , therefore , the case of a bunch with zero initial energy spread or , more simply , a two - particle system with the test electron in front of the source , such that @xmath266 .",
    "let us restrict to a case in which only space charge effects are important , as concerns the longitudinal motion : therefore we consider , in this sense , two electrons running on a straight path .    the coulomb ( space - charge ) interaction changes both the kinetic energy of the particles and their relative distance , which we will assume , initially , equal to @xmath26 in the laboratory frame .",
    "let us deal with the problem in the ( instantaneous ) rest frame of the center of mass of the system ( simply designated as the rest frame , in the following ) and assume that the particles do not move relativistically in such a frame .",
    "after a long time one will be left , asymptotically , with two particles far away from each other , each one with a kinetic energy equal to @xmath267 , where @xmath268 .",
    "therefore , the change in kinetic energy of the test particle in the laboratory frame , can be found by means of a lorentz transformation ( performed on the momentum in the longitudinal direction ) :    @xmath269    on the other hand , again in the asymptotic limit , the potential energy of the test electron ( as well as the one of the source ) will approach zero .",
    "then , at least after a long time from the beginning of the evolution , one has    @xmath270    this means that the first assumption for the cancellation ( @xmath271 at every time ) is violated , due to the inclusion of space charge forces in the longitudinal motion ; as a result we can say that there is no cancellation effect .    of course",
    ", one could also treat the situation of a circular motion , which is more complicated , but the example we gave is sufficient to show that the effect is not valid in general .",
    "we are now left to deal with the second viewpoint .",
    "as it has already been said above , by following this approach , we assume that , in zero approximation , the particles move under the action of the external field alone and then , once the particles motion is fixed ( in the zeroth order ) , one can calculate the perturbation to such a motion due to self - fields . note that , if one treats in this framework the example of a coasting beam or of a rigid line bunch with finite longitudinal dimension , then @xmath43 is constant , which suggest there are no more contradictions with the cancellation assumptions",
    ". nevertheless we will now show that cancellation is far from being a general effect .",
    "let us study , first , the case of a rigid bunch .",
    "consider , for example , the two cases of a rigid line bunch oriented either along the velocity or perpendicular to it ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) .",
    "schematic of a line bunch in a circular trajectory ; ( a ) the line bunch is oriented along the velocity ; ( b ) the line bunch is oriented perpendicularly with respect to the velocity.,width=340 ]    for simplicity we can study the non - relativistic case : in the relativistic one we have an analogous situation .",
    "the kinetic energy of the line bunch and the scalar potential acting on each particle do not depend on the orientation of the bunch with respect to the velocity vector . if the cancellation effect had general validity ,",
    "also the transverse self - force should not depend on the orientation but , indeed , one can easily verify that , for the case of the line bunch oriented along the perpendicular direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig12]b ) , the self - interaction force is two times smaller than in the case of orientation along the longitudinal direction .",
    "in fact , in the case of the bunch oriented in the longitudinal direction we have repelling forces parallel to the velocity vector while , in the other case , they are perpendicular : according to eq .",
    "( [ stress ] ) , the momentum flux along the parallel direction ( that is @xmath272 ) is then equal to the potential energy but having opposite sign in the first case , and equal to zero in the second .",
    "this fact shows that the cancellation effect has no general validity .",
    "this can be discussed in a somewhat deeper way too . as we showed in section",
    "[ sec : steadytwo ] , in order to get a correct dynamical interpretation of the electrodynamical transverse forces for a two - particle system , one needs to account for the self - interaction energy and momentum flux and , by doing so , the energy and momentum of the system do not form a four - vector anymore ( as , instead , people always assume in considering the cancellation issue ) .",
    "they are , indeed , components of a second rank tensor ( the energy - momentum tensor ) and , therefore , transform in a different way with respect to a four - vector : this is the conceptual reason which explains why the cancellation is not a fundamental effect ; as soon as one can not consider energy and momentum as a four - vector anymore the cancellation is spoiled , in general , by the @xmath272 component of the stress tensor in the rest frame .",
    "also the analysis of the transient behavior leads to the conclusion that the compensation is not of general importance .",
    "let us consider the case of a bunch entering a bend ( which we discussed in section [ sec : transientbunch ] , in the laboratory frame .",
    "the formation length for both the scalar potential and the transverse force ( after which the bunch reaches the steady state situation ) is simply the overtaking length @xmath273 .",
    "now , on the one hand the transverse force is zero at the beginning of the bend , and relaxes to a @xmath106-independent value in the steady - state situation while , on the other hand , the scalar potential starts from a @xmath106-dependent value before the bend and relaxes to a @xmath106-independent value in the steady state regime too .",
    "comparing the two transients for the scalar potential and for the transverse force , we can therefore conclude that the first one is characterized by an additional free parameter ( the initial value of the beam energy ) with respect to the second , and this means that the two transients are completely independent . as a result , again , the compensation proves to fail in this case ( since it should follow from the subtraction of the centrifugal force with the term , in @xmath274 , proportional to @xmath275 ) .",
    "of course , again , from a more general viewpoint , the failure of the cancellation can be just seen as a consequence of the fact that energy and momentum are components of a tensor , and not of a vector , that is as a consequence of the different geometrical nature of a vector with respect to a tensor .    as a last example , one can study , again in the perturbative framework , the case of a beam with an initial kinetic energy chirp ( which encompasses the bunch compression case ) or , equivalently , the case of two electrons moving on rectilinear trajectory in such a way that that , for the test particle ,    @xmath276    which justifies the perturbative approach .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that , in first order in the self - fields , space charge induces a change in kinetic energy , in the laboratory frame , given by    @xmath277    where we started from the rest frame , we used a first order expansion in the kinetic energy difference , @xmath278 , and , finally , a lorentz transformation to the laboratory frame .",
    "( [ dts ] ) shows that @xmath259 includes a free parameter ( equal to @xmath279 ) which depends on the energy chirp .",
    "this makes the assumption @xmath280 incorrect and demonstrates that the cancellation issue does not exist at all during the bunching process .    to sum up",
    ", the final result of this investigation is that the cancellation effect has by no means general validity and that one must exercise extreme care when dealing with transverse dynamics issues .",
    "for example , the qualitative discussion in this section shows that , in contrast with @xcite , when one considers the problem of calculating the emittance dilution in a bunch compressor , not only centripetal force but also centrifugal contributions must be taken into account .",
    "we can conclude that , in practice , the total force one has to account for is , at least , one order of magnitude larger than the so called centripetal force .",
    "in this paper we presented a fully electrodynamical study of transverse self - forces within an electron bunch moving in an arc of a circle .",
    "our analysis is based on a line - bunch model . in the case of test particles in front of the source ,",
    "our model is valid whenever @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the source electron is in front of the test electron , then the situation is more complicated and the model can be applied for @xmath281 the cases that do not fulfill these conditions are left for future study .    in section",
    "[ sec : steadytwo ] we studied , first , the situation of a two - particle system moving on a circular path , finding an approximated expression for the transverse self - forces which is the product of a factor dependent on the parameters that specify the system setup and a universal function ( i.e. a function independent of such parameters ) : for every distance between the particles we found a centrifugal force , which has a qualitative and quantitative explanation by means of simple arguments from relativistic dynamics .",
    "we concluded that both the tail - head and head - tail interactions are important : in the first case the coulomb interaction plays a role besides the radiative one , while in the second only radiative contributions are present .",
    "further on , in section [ sec : steadybunch ] , after discussing the applicability region of our model , we integrated the results for a two - particle system , thus finding an expression for the transverse interaction between a line bunch and a particle in front of it .",
    "such an expression is structured as the sum of a centrifugal logarithmic part and a centripetal term , of which we studied the asymptotic behaviors in the limit of short and long bunch , both with a small distance between the test particle and the bunch head .",
    "in particular we found that , in the limit of a short bunch , the centripetal force tends to zero as @xmath282 , while in the limit of a long bunch we found results already well known in literature .",
    "we were able to explain the constant centripetal term in the latter case as an overall effect of the transient between the asymptotic behavior ( identical in @xmath27 , different in @xmath26 ) of the transverse force in the two - particle system , respectively for small or long distance between the two electrons .",
    "we concluded that the centripetal term is therefore only of mathematical nature , and there is no physical ground to distinguish it from the centrifugal term : from a physical viewpoint there is , in fact , just an overall centrifugal force .",
    "in section [ sec : transientwo ] , again within the region of applicability of our model , we extended our considerations to a two - particle system moving in an arc of a circle , thus finding , for the first time , exact and approximated analytical expressions for the transverse force in all the possible transient configurations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , including the case in which the source particle is in front of the test particle .",
    "furthermore we plotted the expression for the transverse force in several practical cases , which are important for a quick evaluation of the magnitude of the effect and for cross - checks between computer codes .",
    "in particular we report a very good agreement with trafic@xmath170 , which demonstrates that such a code can easily deal , from a numerical viewpoint with the transverse transient problem .    in section [ sec : transientbunch ]",
    ", we analyzed the situation of the transverse interaction between a line bunch and a test particle moving in an arc of a circle .",
    "we treated , in particular the case of the injection from a straight section into a hard - edge bending magnet .",
    "firstly we calculated exact and approximated expressions for the transverse force ; secondly , following what we did in section [ sec : transientwo ] , we provided a few graphical examples ; thirdly we analyzed our expressions in the limit for a long bunch and a short minimal distance between the test particle and the head of the bunch .",
    "we showed that the contribution from the particles whose retarded positions are in the straight line before the bend is well described , as a function of the normalized angular position of the test particle inside the bend , by a boxcar function with length equal to the normalized bunch angular length multiplied by a characteristic constant which depends on the structure of the retardation condition . by simple composition of rectangular bunches we provided an expression for the calculation of the transverse interaction in the case of a long bunch with an arbitrary density distribution .",
    "we showed that , in the chosen limits , the contribution from the particles in the bend is independent from @xmath95 and that , in contrast to this , the contribution from the particles in the straight line is dependent on @xmath95 .",
    "finally we proved that such a dependence can be removed by subtraction of the steady - state transverse self - interaction , thus providing a `` regularized '' expression for @xmath134 .",
    "the case of injection provides a useful example for a quick evaluation of the transverse self - fields magnitude as well as for computer codes benchmark . by means of the same approach",
    "one can analyze also the case of ejection , which is left to future work .    finally , in section [ sec : cancel ] we proved that the partial compensation of transverse self - force has by no means general validity , and one must exercise extreme care when dealing with transverse dynamic issues .",
    "in fact , in contrast with @xcite , we concluded that , when one considers the problem of calculating the emittance dilution in a bunch compressor , not only centripetal force but also centrifugal contributions must be taken into account .",
    "therefore , in practice , the total force one has to account for is , at least , one order of magnitude larger than the so called centripetal force .",
