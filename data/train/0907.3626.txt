    "<S> we calculate the rapidity dependence of @xmath0 nuclear modification factor and averaged transverse momentum square in heavy ion collisions at rhic in a 3-dimensional transport approach with regeneration mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 production , regeneration , heavy ion collisions , quark - gluon plasma 25.75.-q , 12.38.mh , 24.85.+p    @xmath0 suppression  @xcite is widely accepted as a probe of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions and was first observed at sps  @xcite more than ten years ago . at rhic and lhc energy , a significant number of charm quarks are generated in central heavy ion collisions , and the recombination of these uncorrelated charm quarks offers another source for @xmath0 production  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are different ways to describe the @xmath0 regeneration . in the statistical model  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> all the @xmath0s are produced at hadronization of the system through thermal distributions and charm conservation . in some other models , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0s come from both the continuous regeneration inside the hot medium and primordial production through initial nucleon - nucleon collisions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the regeneration is used to describe  @xcite the @xmath0 nuclear modification factor @xmath1 and averaged transverse momentum square @xmath2 . from the experimental data  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at rhic , the @xmath1 is almost the same as that at sps , which seems difficult to explain in models with only primordial production mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity dependence of @xmath0 production was also measured at rhic  @xcite and discussed in models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the surprising finding of the experimental result is that the apparent suppression at forward rapidity is stronger than that at midrapidity , i.e. @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is again difficult to explain in models with only initial production mechanism , since the suppression at midrapidity should be stronger than that at forward rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> not only @xmath1 but also @xmath4 depends on the rapidity  @xcite . in semi - central and central au+au collisions the value of @xmath4 at midrapidity is lower than that at forward rapidity , i.e. @xmath5 . in this paper , we will discuss the rapidity dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in a 3-dimensional transport model with both initial production and continuous regeneration mechanisms .    at rhic @xmath0s </S>",
    "<S> are detected at midrapidity @xmath6 and forward rapidity @xmath7 , both are located in the plateau of the rapidity distribution of light hadrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the space - time evolution of the qgp can be approximately described by the transverse hydrodynamic equations at midrapidity  @xcite , and the @xmath0 motion is controlled by a 3-dimensional transport equation in an explicitly boost invariant form @xmath8f_\\psi = -\\alpha_\\psi f_\\psi+\\beta_\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the charmonium distribution function in phase space at fixed impact parameter @xmath10 , and we have used transverse energy @xmath11 , rapidity @xmath12 $ ] , proper time @xmath13 and space - time rapidity @xmath14}$ ] to replace the charmonium energy @xmath15 , longitudinal momentum @xmath16 , time @xmath17 and longitudinal coordinate @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the term with transverse velocity @xmath19 reflects the leakage effect in charmonium motion . to take into account the decay of the charmonium excitation states into @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , the symbol @xmath20 here stands for @xmath21 and @xmath22 and the ratio of their contributions in the initial condition is taken as 6:3:1 . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression and regeneration in the qgp are described by the loss and gain terms on the right hand side of the transport equation . considering the gluon dissociation process </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath23 can be explicitly written as  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the transition probability  @xcite as a function of the colliding energy @xmath26 of the dissociation process , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the gluon energy and gluon thermal distribution , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition and dissociation temperature of @xmath20 , taken as @xmath31 mev ,  @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the two step functions @xmath34 in @xmath23 indicate that the suppression is finite in the qgp phase at temperature @xmath35 and becomes infinite at @xmath36 . we have here neglected the suppression process in hadron phase  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the gain term @xmath37 can be obtained from the loss term @xmath23 by considering detailed balance  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume local thermalization of charm quarks in the qgp and take the charm quark distribution as @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the density of charm quarks in coordinate space , @xmath40 and @xmath41  the normalized fermi distribution in momentum space , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the thickness functions for the two colliding nuclei determined by nuclear geometry . </S>",
    "<S> since the large uncertainty of charm quark production cross section in pp collisions for both experimental and theoretical studies , we assume the rapidity dependence of charm production as a gauss distribution @xmath44 with @xmath45b which agrees with the experimental data  @xcite and @xmath46 to determine the parameter @xmath47 which is in between the smallest and largest theoretical estimation  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the primordial charmonium production is reflected in the initial condition of the transport equation at the starting time @xmath48 . by fitting the experimental data  @xcite for pp collisions at rhic , </S>",
    "<S> the initial charmonium momentum distribution is extracted as @xmath49^{-6},\\ ] ] where the rapidity distribution @xmath50 is a double gauss function  @xcite , and the rapidity dependence of the averaged transverse momentum square is taken as @xmath51 with the parameters @xmath52 4.1 ( gev / c)@xmath53 and @xmath54 . note that , to include the cronin effect in the initial state of heavy ion collisions  @xcite , we add an extra term to @xmath2 which comes from the gluon multi - scattering with nucleons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the charmonium production , including initial production and regeneration , is related to the qgp evolution through the local temperature @xmath55 and fluid velocity @xmath56 appearing in the thermal gluon and charm quark distributions , they are determined by the ideal hydrodynamics  @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( left panel ) and averaged transverse momentum square @xmath57 ( right panel ) at mid and forward rapidity as functions of number of participants @xmath58 . the theoretical calculations with only initial production ( dot - dashed lines ) , only regeneration ( dashed lines ) and both ( solid lines ) </S>",
    "<S> are compared with the experimental data  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=44.0% ] ( left panel ) and averaged transverse momentum square @xmath57 ( right panel ) at mid and forward rapidity as functions of number of participants @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical calculations with only initial production ( dot - dashed lines ) , only regeneration ( dashed lines ) and both ( solid lines ) are compared with the experimental data  @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.5% ]    with the known distribution @xmath59 , one can calculate the @xmath0 yield and momentum spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear modification factor @xmath1 and averaged transverse momentum square @xmath4 at mid and forward rapidity are shown in fig.[fig1 ] as functions of centrality . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath1 is normalized to the pp collisions , the assumption of the same medium at mid and forward rapidity leads to similar @xmath1 in the two rapidity regions , when we consider only initial production , as shown in the left panel . </S>",
    "<S> the regeneration at forward rapidity is , however , much less than that at mid rapidity . as a result of the competition </S>",
    "<S> , the total @xmath1 at forward rapidity is less than that at mid rapidity , consistent with the experimental observation .    </S>",
    "<S> while the population is dominated by low momentum @xmath0s , the averaged transverse momentum carries more information on high momentum @xmath0s and can tell us more about the dynamics of charmonium production and suppression . </S>",
    "<S> the initially produced @xmath0s are from the hard nucleon - nucleon process at the very beginning of the collision and their @xmath16 spectrum is harder . from the gluon multi - scattering with nucleons before the two gluons fuse into a @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , there is a @xmath16 broadening for the initially produced @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> considering further the leakage effect which enables the high momentum @xmath0s escape from the anomalous suppression in the hot medium , the initially produced @xmath4 increases smoothly with centrality and becomes saturated at large @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> since the regenerated @xmath0s are from the thermalized charm quarks inside the qgp , their averaged momentum is small and almost independent of the centrality . </S>",
    "<S> both the initially produced and regenerated @xmath2 is not sensitive to the rapidity region . </S>",
    "<S> while the difference between the initially produced and regenerated @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath58 , the difference between the values of @xmath4 from the two rapidity regions increases smoothly with centrality ! the total @xmath4 depends strongly on the fraction of the regeneration . at mid rapidity , the regeneration and initial production are equally important in central collisions , see the left panel of fig.[fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the large contribution from the regeneration leads to a remarkable decrease of the value of @xmath4 at mid rapidity . at forward rapidity </S>",
    "<S> , the regeneration contribution is , however , very small even for central collisions , see the left panel again . in this case , the total @xmath4 is dominated by the initial production in the whole @xmath58 region .    in summary , we calculated the @xmath0 nuclear modification factor and averaged transverse momentum square at mid and forward rapidity in a three dimensional transport approach . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed rapidity dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath4 in au+au collisions at @xmath26=200 gev can well be explained by our model calculation where the continuous regeneration of @xmath0 from thermalized charm quarks in qgp is an important ingredient . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that at higher colliding energies , for example at lhc , the regeneration will become the dominant ingredient . </S>"
