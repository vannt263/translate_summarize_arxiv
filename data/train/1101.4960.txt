    "over the past two decades electron correlation has been established as the underlying mechanism for many important phenomena arising from the interaction of strong laser pulses with matter .",
    "one of these phenomena is the dramatically enhanced multiple ionization yield of atoms ( e.g. @xcite ) and molecules ( e.g. @xcite ) in intense laser pulses . when the field intensity is large the two electrons are stripped out sequentially @xcite while for smaller intensities non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi ) dominates .",
    "according to the accepted mechanism for nsdi  the three - step or re - scattering model @xcite1 ) one electron escapes through the field - lowered coulomb potential , 2 ) it moves in the strong infrared laser field and 3 ) it returns to the core ( possibly multiple times ) to transfer energy to the other electron in the parent atomic or molecular ion . using coincidence imaging techniques such as coltrims",
    "many experiments have succeeded in obtaining highly differential kinematical details of electron correlation in the non - sequential intensity regime ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , for higher intensities the available experimental data is much less abundant .",
    "correspondingly , the majority of theoretical work has concentrated on the non - sequential intensity regime ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "addressing the double ionization of strongly driven systems with first - principle quantum mechanical calculations in all three spatial dimensions ( 3-d ) is an immense task .",
    "currently , 3-d ab - initio quantum mechanical calculations are mostly available for the driven he atom @xcite . with the exception of few 3-d ab - initio studies for diatomic molecules with fixed nuclei @xcite , to cope with the highly complex task of tackling double ionization of molecules , many studies use numerical quantum approaches of reduced dimensionality .",
    "others use judiciously chosen quantum models of reduced dimensionality ( e.g. @xcite ) , while some use semi - analytical quantum approaches in the framework of the so - called strong - field approximation ( sfa ) ( e.g. @xcite ) , not fully accounting for the coulomb singularity .    here , we report on a classical study of electron correlation in the n@xmath1 molecule driven by a 27 fs laser pulse at 800 nm for intensities well within the non - sequential double ionization regime as well as for intensities corresponding to the transition from pure tunneling to over - the - barrier ionization .",
    "we use a three - dimensional quasiclassical technique that we developed for conservative systems , i.e. the single photon multiple ionization of atomic systems @xcite .",
    "we extended this technique to non - conservative systems to first treat the correlated electron dynamics of the strongly driven he atom @xcite and subsequently of the strongly driven @xmath0 molecule @xcite .",
    "our method is numerically very efficient and treats the coulomb singularity with no approximation in contrast to techniques that use  soft - core \" potentials .",
    "we describe in a unified way the different double ionization ( di ) pathways the two electrons follow to escape after re - collision as a function of total electron energy for the tunneling regime and for intensities corresponding to the transition from pure tunneling to over - the - barrier ionization  we refer to the latter as intermediate intensities .",
    "( throughout this work the total electron energy we refer to is the sum of the final kinetic energies of the two electrons ) .",
    "a similar description was very recently used to describe the di pathways of strongly driven he @xcite .",
    "this general treatment allows us to identify universal features of strongly - driven molecular double ionization and compare them with the atomic case . in a previous study on",
    "strongly driven @xmath0 @xcite , we identified the di pathways only in the tunneling regime and independent of total electron energy for a very short 7 fs laser pulse . in our current study , we drive @xmath0 with a long laser pulse .",
    "we first discuss the general features of di for different total energies and for intensities in the tunneling and the over - the - barrier regime .",
    "we then show that , for all intensities considered , the di pathways have distinct patterns of correlated momenta along the field polarization axis .",
    "interestingly , for intermediate intensities in the over - the - barrier regime the correlated momenta of the direct pathway  simultaneous ejection of both electrons  have an anticorrelation pattern .",
    "moreover , the correlated momenta of the delayed pathway  ejection of one electron with a delay of more that a quarter of a cycle with respect to re - collision  have a square pattern .",
    "both the anticorrelation and square patterns arise from the  soft \" collisions , re - collision assisted field ionization @xcite , underlying the intermediate intensities in the over - the - barrier ionization . we show that the electron momentum corresponding to the boundary of the square pattern probes the tunneling phase of the re - colliding electron .    finally , we explore in detail the features of the di probability distribution as a function of total electron energy .",
    "we find that in the tunneling regime the di probability distribution has one peak , while for intermediate intensities in the over - the - barrier regime it has two peaks .",
    "we show that one peak ",
    "present for all intensities  is due to the field - assisted re - collision mechanism , and shifts to smaller energies with increasing intensity .",
    "the other peak is due to the  soft \" collisions underlying di for intermediate intensities in the over - the - barrier regime .",
    "this latter peak probes in yet another way the tunneling phase .",
    "the method we use was previously described in @xcite . for completeness",
    "we also describe it in what follows .",
    "our 3-d quasiclassical model entails the following steps : we first set - up the initial phase space distribution of the two  active \" electrons in the n@xmath2 diatomic molecule . here , we consider only parallel alignment between the molecular axis and the laser electric field . at intensities in the tunneling regime",
    "we assume that one electron tunnels through the field - lowered coulomb potential .",
    "for the tunneling rate one can use quantum mechanical or semiclassical formulas for diatomic molecules ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we use the rate provided in ref .",
    "the longitudinal momentum is zero while the transverse one is provided by a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "this description is valid as long as the potential barrier is not completely suppressed by the instantaneous laser field @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the usual laser wavelength of 800  nm , corresponding to @xmath4 ( a.u . - atomic units ) . in our simulation",
    "the pulse envelope @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath9 with t the period of the field . the threshold for over - the - barrier ionization in neutral @xmath0 , with an ionization energy of @xmath10  a.u .",
    ", is reached at a field strength of @xmath11 ( corresponding to roughly @xmath12 ) .    above @xmath12",
    "the laser field allows an unhindered electron escape and therefore the initial phase space is modeled by a double electron microcanonical distribution @xcite .",
    "however , in setting - up the initial phase space distribution we transition smoothly from the tunneling to the over - the - barrier intensity regime .",
    "namely , we assign a random number to the phase @xmath13 of the laser field when the first electron is ionized , see @xcite .",
    "if the phase @xmath13 corresponds to an instantaneous strength of the laser field @xmath14 that leaves the electron below the barrier then we use the initial conditions dictated by the tunneling model .",
    "if the instantaneous field strength pushes the barrier below the @xmath15 of that electron then we use the microcanonical distribution to set - up the initial phase space distribution .",
    "this choice of initial conditions has proven successful in past studies @xcite in modeling the experimental ratio of double versus single ionization for long laser pulses @xcite . with our approach",
    "we ensure a smooth transition of the initial phase space distribution as we change the intensity .",
    "even at an intensity of 3@xmath16 still about 70% of the double ionization probability corresponds to trajectories initialized using the tunneling model , while 30% of the probability corresponds to trajectories initialized using the microcanonical distribution .",
    "after setting - up the initial phase space distribution we transform to a new system of coordinates , the so called  regularized \" coordinates @xcite .",
    "this transformation is exact and explicitly eliminates the coulomb singularity .",
    "this step is more challenging for molecular systems since one has to  regularize \" with respect to more than one atomic centers versus one atomic center for atoms .",
    "we regularize using the global regularization scheme described in ref .",
    "finally , we use the classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) method for the time propagation @xcite .",
    "the propagation involves the 3-d four - body hamiltonian in the laser field with  frozen \" nuclei : @xmath17\\\\        + \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2}|}+(\\vec{r}_{1}+\\vec{r}_{2 } ) \\cdot \\vec{e}(t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the laser electric field polarized along the z direction and further defined as detailed above , and @xmath19 is the internuclear distance .",

    "our goal is to point out that for different intensities and different total energy regimes the di pathways have different characteristic features .    to identify the main di energy transfer pathways we use the time delay between the re - collision time and the time of ionization of each electron @xcite .",
    "we define the re - collision time as the time of minimum approach of the two electrons .",

    "we conclude that this second peak in the total di probability distribution is directly related to these 70% of resi events . indeed , the tunneling phase of 50 - 60@xmath38 results in a final kinetic energy of 1.5 u@xmath24 very close to the peak of the re - colliding electron s resi probability distribution shown in fig .  [ mechanism1 ] .",
    "thus this second peak in the di probability distribution is yet another probe of the tunneling phase .",

    "we have explored in detail the prevalence of the di pathways for strongly driven @xmath0 for intensities ranging from the tunneling regime to intermediate ones in the over - the - barrier regime .",
    "we have found that the delayed pathway prevails for all intensities and for all total energies , with the exception of very small energies .",
    "this is different from the atomic case where se prevails for intermediate total energies for intensities where 3.2 u@xmath24 is above the first excitation energy of he@xmath37 .    for intermediate intensities in the over - the - barrier regime",
    ", we find that  soft \" collisions underly di . in these `` soft '' collisions electron 1 tunnels at a large phase of the laser field , around 50@xmath38 , has a small maximum excursion in the laser field , and upon its return to the molecular ion transfers a small amount of energy to electron 2 .",
    "one feature of  soft \" collisions is that electron 1 ionizes early on , before re - collision at t/2this holds true for 70% of resi and for 30% of se trajectories . for the intermediate intensities in the over - the - barrier regime",
    ", we have shown that the boundaries of the square pattern of the correlated momenta as well as one of the two peaks of the di probability distribution as a function of total energy probe the tunneling phase of the re - colliding electron .",
