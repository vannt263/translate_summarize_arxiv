    "the conductivity has a broad maximum and decreases below 200  k. this behavior corresponds to a smooth transition between metallic and insulating states .",
    "the esr spectrum consists of a single lorentzian line at all temperatures both at 9 and 225  ghz confirming the phase purity of the sample .",
    "phase inhomogeneities usually split the line or at least inhomogeneously broaden it due to differences in the @xmath43-factor .",

    "the change of the temperature dependence of the static susceptibility from pauli to curie like is gradual , there is no well defined phase transition .",

    "the distortion of the line and the broadening at 225  ghz is due to a partially averaged g - factor anisotropy .",
    "we attribute the broadening at @xmath55  k ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : esr3 ] ) to the inhomogeneous interaction between paramagnetic defects randomly distributed in the lattice .",
