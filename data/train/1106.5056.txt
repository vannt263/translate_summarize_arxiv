    "the center of our galaxy has become an active arena for studying possible tests of general relativity ( gr ) in the strong - field regime , because of the near certainty that it harbors a 4 million solar - mass black hole , colloquially denoted sgra * ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "numerous authors have studied the observability of relativistic effects in the vicinity of the black hole , in the observable motion and behavior of orbiting stars @xcite , in the effects of lensing @xcite , or in the properties of accretion phenomena @xcite .",
    "one of us recently suggested that observations of a hypothetical class of stars orbiting very close to the galactic center black hole could provide tests of the so - called `` no - hair '' theorem of general relativity @xcite .",
    "specifically , measurements of the precessions of the orbital planes of a number of stars with an accuracy of @xmath1 microarcseconds ( @xmath2as ) per year could determine both the angular momentum @xmath3 and the quadrupole moment @xmath4 of the black hole , and thereby test the constraint @xmath5 imposed by the kerr solution of general relativity .",
    "detection of such stars and achieving the required astrometric accuracy are goals of the next - generation of near - infrared , adaptive optics interferometry being designed and built by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "however , in assessing the feasibility of such strong - field gr tests , one must inevitably address potential complications , notably the perturbing effect of the other stars that may also reside in a cluster close to the black hole .",
    "using @xmath0-body simulations , merritt _",
    "( @xcite , hereafter referred to as mamw ) showed that for a range of possible stellar and stellar - mass black hole distributions within the central few milliparsecs ( mpc ) of the black hole , there could exist stars in eccentric orbits with semi - major axes less than @xmath6 milliparsecs for which the orbital - plane precessions induced by the stars and black holes would not exceed the relativistic precessions .",
    "these conclusions were gleaned from thousands of simulations of clusters ranging from seven to 180 stars and stellar mass black holes orbiting a @xmath7 maximally rotating black hole , taking into account the long - term evolution of the system as influenced by close stellar encounters , dynamical relaxation effects , and capture of stars by the black hole .    in this paper",
    "we study the extent to which the conclusions of mamw can be understood , at least within an order of magnitude , using analytic orbit perturbation theory .",
    "we calculate the average change in the orientation of the orbital plane of a given `` target '' star orbiting the massive black hole , as determined by its inclination and ascending node angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 , induced by the newtonian gravitational attraction of a distant third star ( which could be either inside or outside the target star s orbit ) .",
    "the perturbing accelerations are expanded in terms of multipoles through @xmath10 .",
    "we then calculate the root - mean - square variation of each orbit element , averaged over all possible orientations of the perturbing star s orbit , and averaged over a distribution of orbits in semi - major axis and eccentricity , arguing that this will give an estimate of the `` noise '' induced by the graininess of the otherwise spherically symmetric perturbing environment .     for a target star with @xmath11 plotted against semi - major axis , for three models with @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",

    "shown ( blue in color version ) are results from integration i ( dashed curves ) , integration ii ( solid curves ) and integration iii ( dot - dash curves ) .",
    "also shown are the amplitudes of frame - dragging ( black in color version ) and quadrupole ( red in color version ) relativistic precessions for the corresponding star , assuming a maximally rotating black hole .",

    "they have number densities that vary as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the semi - major axis of the perturbing star , and have eccentricity distributions that vary as @xmath18 ; in fig . 1 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , corresponding to a distribution with isotropic velocity dispersion .",
    "they have an equal number of @xmath19 stars and @xmath20 black holes .",
    "the label @xmath15 , chosen to parallel the notation of @xcite , denotes the total mass within one mpc of the black hole ; the three cases correspond to a total number of perturbing bodies within a radius of four mpc of 7 , 21 and 72 , respectively .",
    "the target star has eccentricity @xmath21 , and its semi - major axis @xmath22 ranges from @xmath23 to @xmath24 mpc .",
    "plotted is the rate of precession of the vector perpendicular to the orbital plane , @xmath25 , observed at the source , in arcminutes per year , calculated using three ways of carrying out the integrals over the stellar distribution .",
    "the dashed line denotes an integration ( i ) in which all perturbing stars are assumed to be sufficiently far from the target star at all times that their pericenters are outside its apocenter or that their apocenters are inside its pericenter .",
    "the solid line denotes an integration ( ii ) in which closer encounters are permitted , limited by demanding that all perturbing stars be on orbits such that the higher @xmath26 contributions to @xmath25 be at worst comparable to the contribution at lowest order in @xmath26 .",
    "the dot - dashed line denotes an integration ( iii ) which uses a fitting formula that interpolates between the extreme limits of a perturbing star well outside the target star , and a perturbing star well inside the target star ; in this case the integration is over the entire stellar distribution .",
    "the orange band in each panel denotes the value of @xmath25 corresponding to an astrometric precession rate @xmath27 of @xmath28as per year as seen from earth , given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the semi - major axis in units of mpc ; we use 8 kiloparsecs as the distance to the galactic center .    also plotted are the amplitudes of the frame - dragging and quadrupole precessions for a kerr black hole , given by @xcite @xmath31^{3/2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & 0.769 ( 1-e^2)^{-3/2}\\chi { \\tilde a}^{-3 } \\ , { \\rm arcmin \\ , yr^{-1 } }   \\,,\\label{eq : defaj } \\\\ a_q & = &   \\frac{3\\pi}{p } \\chi^2 \\left [ \\frac{gm}{c^2 a(1-e^2)}\\right]^{2 }   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx & 7.97 \\times 10^{-4 } ( 1-e^2)^{-2}\\chi^2 { \\tilde a}^{-7/2 } { \\rm arcmin \\ , yr^{-1 } }   \\ , ,   \\label{eq : defaq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the orbital period , and where @xmath33 is the dimensionless kerr spin parameter , set equal to its maximum value of unity in fig .  1 .",
    "because integration i keeps the stars far from the target star , the precessions are small . by contrast , the fitting formula of integration iii is large for very close encounters , so not surprisingly , the precessions from that method are large .",
    "integration ii gives results intermediate between the two .",
    "interestingly , the spread between these methods is roughly consistent with the spread between individual precessions obtained in the @xmath0-body simulations of mamw .",
    "this can be seen in the top panel of mamw , fig .",
    "7 , which corresponds to the middle panel of fig .  1 ( to properly compare the two figures , one must translate between @xmath25 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "it can also been in the bottom panel of mamw fig .  5 , where the points labelled by @xmath34 indicate the mean precessions in the absence of black hole spin , for the same three stellar distributions as are shown in fig .  1",
    "thus we regard our three integration methods as giving a reasonable estimate of the range of stellar perturbations .    comparing the three stellar distributions shown in fig .  1",
    ", we see that the effects vary roughly as @xmath35 , as expected , from the nature of our r.m.s . calculation .",
    "we consider eight different stellar distribution models , and for seven of them , consider models with equal numbers of stars and black holes , and models with only stars , totalling 15 models . in all but one case , the precessions are generally smaller than the ones shown in fig .  1 , and that case is a centrally condensed model with a non - isotropic velocity dispersion leading to a preponderance of highly eccentric orbits . we conclude that , for a target star in a very eccentric orbit with @xmath36 mpc , there is a reasonable possibility of seeing relativistic frame - dragging and quadrupole effects above the level of @xmath28as / yr without undue interference from stellar perturbations .",

    "again , the general expressions are long , so we will not display them here .",
    "since the orbital energy of the target star is proportional to @xmath111 , eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) simply reflects the absence of a secular energy exchange mechanism between the target and perturbing stars at first order in the perturbations .",
    "as a side remark , eqs .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ i1 ] ) together imply that @xmath112 is a constant , so that a decreasing inclination produces an increasing eccentricity ; in planetary dynamics this is known as the kozai mechanism @xcite .",
    "with the time - averaged changes in the orbital elements due to one perturbing star in hand , we now turn to the changes caused by a distribution of perturbing stars .",
    "we will assume a cluster of stars whose orbital orientations ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) are randomly distributed .",
    "we will discuss the distributions in @xmath17 and @xmath96 later .",
    "the `` orientation - average '' of a function will be defined by @xmath113 we then find that @xmath114 for all four orbit elements @xmath58 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath115 , for both internal and external stars . the reason is easy to understand : the averaging process is equivalent to smearing the perturbing stars mass over a concentric set of spherically symmetric shells .",
    "the target star will thus be moving in what amounts to a spherically symmetric , @xmath116 potential and its orbit elements will therefore be constant .",
    "but for a finite number of stars , the potential will not be perfectly spherically symmetric , even if the orientations are randomly distributed .",
    "it is the effect of this discreteness that we wish to estimate .",
    "we do this by calculating the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "angular average @xmath117^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "this will give an estimate of the `` noise '' induced in the orbital motion of the target star by the surrounding matter .",
    "we will then compare this noise with the relativistic effects that we wish to measure .",
    "we will focus on the quantity @xmath118 rather than the individual elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; this quantity represents the r.m.s change in the direction of @xmath119 , the normal to the orbital plane .",
    "the leading contributions from internal and external stars are given by @xmath120 appendix a lists the separate r.m.s .",

    "rate of change of the orbital orientation by @xmath124 .",
    "we now integrate over the semi - major axis @xmath17 and eccentricity @xmath96 of the perturbing stars .",
    "we will use a distribution function of the form @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is normalization factor , set by the condition @xmath127 , where @xmath0 is the total number of stars in the distribution , and @xmath128 where the limits of integration will be determined by the limiting orbital elements for those stars .",
    "following mamw , we will consider a range of parametrized models for the dependences @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and will consider clusters that contain both stars and stellar - mass black holes .",
    "the variables @xmath17 and @xmath96 will be constrained by a number of considerations .",
    "the minimum pericenter distance @xmath131 for any body will be given by the tidal - disruption radius for a star , and the capture radius for a black hole .",
    "this will therefore give the bound @xmath132 for @xmath131 we will use the estimates @xmath133 these are derived in appendix b.    however our analytic formulae for the r.m.s .",
    "orientation - averaged variations are valid only in the limits @xmath134 or @xmath135 for internal and external stars , respectively .",
    "but since our target star is embedded inside the cluster of stars , there may well be perturbing stars that do not satisfy either constraint .",
    "on the other hand an encounter between the target star and another star that is too close could perturb the orbit so strongly that it will be unsuitable for any kind of relativity test .",
    "because we are looking only for an estimate of the statistical noise induced by the cloud of stars , we will try three approaches in order to capture the range of perturbations induced by the cluster .",
    "_ integration i. _ because eqs .",
    "( [ rmsinner ] ) and ( [ rmsouter ] ) are valid only in the extreme limits where the perturbing star is always far from the target star ( so that the higher - order terms are suitably small ) , we cut out of the stellar distribution any stars that violate this constraint .",
    "this yields the following conditions on the allowed orbital elements of the perturbing stars : ( i ) for an internal star , we demand that @xmath136 of the perturbing star be less than @xmath137 of the target star ; ( ii ) for an external star , we demand that @xmath138 of the perturbing star be greater than @xmath139 of the target star .    for an internal star , we thus have the two conditions , @xmath140 the maximum values of @xmath96 and @xmath17 allowed under these conditions are @xmath141 for an external star , we have the two conditions @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the outer boundary of the cluster , chosen to be large enough that the effects of stars beyond this boundary are assumed to be negligible .",
    "following mamw , we choose @xmath144 mpc .",
    "the maximum @xmath96 and minimum @xmath17 allowed are thus @xmath145 thus the average of a function @xmath146 over this distribution will be given by @xmath147 where @xmath148 however , instead of substituting @xmath127 , we substitute @xmath149 where @xmath150 this amounts to assuming that all @xmath0 stars in the cluster happen to have orbit elements that satisfy our constraint .",
    "thus the average of the function @xmath146 will be given by @xmath151 note that if @xmath152 , we get @xmath153 .    in our simple model , we are treating the stars and black holes as independent distributions , so the mean value of @xmath154 can be written as a sum over the two normalized distributions , @xmath155 where the only difference between the integrals for the distributions is the value of @xmath131 , which affects only the integrals @xmath156 and @xmath157 , and the number of particles , @xmath158 for stars , and @xmath159 for black holes , with @xmath160 ; for later use , we define @xmath161 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath162 for the r.m.s .",
    "variations in @xmath163 , we include all the higher - order terms shown in appendix a.    _ integration ii . _",
    "taking the ratio of the higher @xmath26 contributions to the orbit element variations to the leading @xmath26 contribution ( see appendix a ) reveals that the parameter controlling the relative size of the higher - order terms is the ratio @xmath164 for internal stars , and @xmath165 for external stars . requiring each of these ratios in turn to be less than one , we repeat the integrals , but with new limits of integration given by @xmath166 this condition permits closer encounters than the condition imposed in integration i. here as well , we include all higher - order contributions to the r.m.s . variations .    _ integration iii_. in an attempt to include even closer encounters between the target star and cluster stars , we adopt a fitting formula for the r.m.s .",

( 12.31 ) of @xcite ) @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the so - called `` apsidal constant '' of the star , a dimensionless measure of how centrally condensed it is .",
    "inserting @xmath212 , we obtain @xmath213 the variations in @xmath8 and @xmath9 scale in exactly the same way , but are further suppressed by the sine of the angle by which the tidal bulge points out of the orbital plane , resulting from the rotation of the star coupled with molecular viscosity , leading to a lag between the radial direction and the tidal bulge .",
    "this angle is expected to be very small .",
    "thus we can conclude that , as far as perturbations of the orbital planes are concerned , tidal distortions will not be important ."
