    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) are amongst the most useful probes of the early universe .",
    "their utility is two - fold , both in yielding information about their host galaxy and immediate environment , and as beacons , marking out mass and structure at the highest redshifts @xcite .",
    "given their high energies , they can potentially be observed out to @xmath9 or further with current instruments , but redshift determination for these high redshift bursts is challenging , requiring deep integrations with optical and near - infrared telescopes in the hours after a source is detected . despite this , the few known @xmath10 sources have provided valuable evidence for the properties of dust @xcite and molecular clouds @xcite at these early times and for the column density of neutral hydrogen in their environment @xcite .    while grbs do not require massive host galaxies @xcite , they do require the presence of significant quantities of gravitationally collapsed and processed baryonic matter in the form of young stars . at high redshifts ,",
    "this condition is believed to be sufficiently rare to make them likely markers of overdense regions in the cosmic web and hence a measure of the power of small scale density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "using such beacons may be the only way to identify and characterize star forming regions during cosmic reionization - the epoch during which the first stars heated and ionised neutral hydrogen atoms in the intergalactic medium .",
    "gamma ray burst ( grb ) 090423 at @xmath11 is the most distant known object with a well - defined , spectroscopically - confirmed redshift @xcite . occurring just 600myr after the big bang",
    ", it likely probes the tail end of the epoch of reionization .",
    "its afterglow and host galaxy provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the properties of a star forming galaxy at these early times , and it is likely to be the archetype for future observations on similarly distant grbs ( see the decadal survey whitepaper by * ? ? ? * for discussion ) .",
    "crucially , the properties of grb090423 are consistent with the bulk of the grb population @xcite , lacking the long duration and extreme energy output that might be expected from a pop iii progenitor @xcite . as such",
    ", this burst must mark out a region in which star formation is already well under way , and in which the interstellar and intergalactic medium has already undergone processing . for this to have occurred at such high redshifts",
    "requires this region to have collapsed early in the history of the universe , implying that it is highly overdense relative to the volume average at early times .",
    "by @xmath12 , it is possible for dark matter haloes as massive as a few @xmath13m@xmath4 to have collapsed , albeit in small numbers @xcite .",
    "while grb090423 is not coincident with a known agn , it could plausibly lie either in a massive halo , or in the mass overdensity associated with such a halo .",
    "interpretation of high redshift bursts , particularly in the context of evolutionary trends such as the cosmic star formation rate history and inferences made from it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , requires an understanding of the burst environment and how it too changes with redshift . at low redshift , grbs are not unbiased tracers of star formation , but are seen to occur preferentially in low mass , metal poor galaxies @xcite .",
    "semi - analytic models , applied to large simulations such as the millennium simulation , suggest that grb host galaxy halo mass is largely independent of redshift to @xmath14 @xcite , but observational evidence for this is sparse . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the ratio between gamma ray burst rate and star formation density scales as @xmath15 , possibly due to evolution in the mean metallicity . if host galaxy stellar masses , star formation rates or dark matter halo masses ( and hence clustering ) of grb hosts evolve with redshift , then the interpretation of burst rate as a proxy for star formation rate history will need to be revisited and refined .",
    "grb090423 provides a case study at high redshifts , potentially probing significant evolution in environment from @xmath16 burst hosts .",
    "given that the grb appears to be the result of a second generation or later starburst at such early times , does it occupy a more massive galaxy than typical of lower redshift bursts , a vigourous starburst , a mature system that has exhausted its gas supply or a young one with a large reservoir of processed molecular gas available for later star formation ?",
    "one test of the latter hypothesis has become possible due to the broad bandwidth and high sensitivity of the current generation of millimetre telescopes . at @xmath12 ,",
    "the rest - frame infrared co(3 - 2 ) emission line ( a good probe of molecular gas mass at low redshift ) is shifted into the observed 7 mm band .",
    "the 4ghz bandwidth available using the new cabb correlator at the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) enables a volume with line - of - sight extent @xmath17 to be observed in a single observation , easily encompassing the redshift uncertainty from optical / near - infrared observations .",
    "given the high redshift of this and similar sources , carbon monoxide and other far - infrared emission lines ( notably [ cii ] at 1898ghz ) may well prove the most accessible diagnostics of the precise redshift of the grb host and any galaxies sharing a large scale structure surrounding it .    in this paper , we describe an investigation to study the co(3 - 2 ) emission line properties of the grb host galaxy and neighbouring galaxies in its immediate environs .",
    "we structure the paper as follows : in section [ sec : obs ] we describe our observations , targeted on the host galaxy of grb090423 and searching for co(3 - 2 ) emission . in section [ sec : grbhost ] we present limits obtained on the properties of the gamma ray burst host . in sections [ sec : contsources ] and [ sec : lineemitter ] we present the properties of additional sources detected in our data , first in continuum and then in molecular line emission .",
    "finally in sections [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the interpretation and implications of our results , before presenting our conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "all optical and near - infrared magnitudes in this paper are quoted in the ab system @xcite .",

    "the same source was used to check the array pointing solution once an hour .",
    "pks1934 - 638 ( the standard flux calibrator at the atca ) was observed at the end of every track to provide primary flux calibration .",
    "observations were scheduled at night in order to obtain the most stable possible conditions for 7 mm band observations .",

    "a multi - frequency ( 4ghz bandwidth ) synthesis image centred at 37.887ghz was also generated from the data , reaching a sensitivity limit ( rms ) of 3.1@xmath0jy beam@xmath32 .",
    "the position of the @xmath34 grb090423 is known to sub - arcsecond accuracy ( from near - infrared imaging of the burst afterglow ) .",
    "the stellar light from galaxies at these distances is believed to have a typical half - light radius of @xmath350.3kpc ( 0.06@xmath28 ) , based on photometrically selected samples @xcite .",
    "the beam size of our atca observations is two orders of magnitude greater than this , and any emission from the the grb host galaxy itself is likely to be contained within a synthesised beam centred at the burst location ( and probing a region @xmath36kpc in extent ) .",
    "our initial analysis focused on the properties of our data at this location .",
    "no continuum source was seen at the grb location in the multi - frequency synthesis image , allowing us to place an upper limit on the 37.9ghz continuum flux of this source of @xmath1=9.3@xmath0jy ( 3@xmath5 , assuming the source is unresolved ) .",
    "this observed frequency corresponds to the rest frame 850@xmath0 m band and so probes the warm dust in the system .",
    "we use the prescription of to calculate an upper limit on the dust mass at @xmath37 , assuming the dust emission can be modeled by a modified black body and accounting for the heating effect of the cosmic microwave background at this redshift .",
    "a number of significant assumptions are required to make this calculation .",

    "there is also a weak dependence on the assumed size of the source . in the absence of further data ,",

    "data are binned to 4mhz ( 32kms@xmath32 ) resolution .",
    "the shaded region indicates the expected frequency range for co(3 - 2 ) emission from the grb090423 host galaxy , assuming a 1@xmath5 error range on the optical / near - infrared redshift . the spectra shown span 10,000kms@xmath32 in velocity space and represent only 35% of our total observed frequency range .",
    "the effect of primary beam attenuation on channel noise at the line emitter location is clearly visible . [",
    "fig : spectra ] ]    our derived upper limit on the dust mass in this source is @xmath38m@xmath4 at 40k . given the typical stellar masses of grb host galaxies at low redshift ( see section [ sec : discussion ] ) our non - detection of the source in dust continuum is unsurprising .",
    "the mean 850@xmath0 m ( observed ) flux measured by @xcite for a sample of 21 grb hosts at @xmath39 implies an average dust mass of only @xmath40m@xmath4 for the lower redshift grb host population using the same prescription applied here . for thermal dust emission across a reasonable range of temperatures , and for a typical low redshift grb host galaxy , our constraint implies only that the dust mass does not exceed the stellar mass .",
    "in addition to probing the dust continuum of the source , our observations are sensitive to co(3 - 2 ) line emission spanning the redshift range @xmath41  easily encompassing the @xmath42 uncertainty in the optical redshift estimate for the grb host .",
    "we have examined our datacube carefully for such emission .",
    "low luminosity galaxies at high redshift have been observed to have lower line widths than most submillimeter galaxies . indeed .",
    "the only two known @xmath43 , non - agn , co - emitting galaxies at have line widths of @xmath44kms@xmath32 @xcite and @xmath45kms@xmath32 @xcite which may suggest that the molecular gas in these sources does not form a rotationally - supported disk . with these narrow lines in mind as a model , we select 150kms@xmath32 as a plausible velocity width for any emission line in our distant source .    in order to optimise our sensitivity to emission with this and",
    "a variety of both broader and narrower velocity widths , the spectral datacube was rebinned at resolutions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16mhz and each rebinned cube was analysed independently . despite this , a spectrum taken through the data cube at the location of the grb host galaxy shows no evidence for line emission at the sensitivity limit of the data at any spectral resolution ( see figure [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "this places an upper limit on the velocity integrated line width of the co(3 - 2 ) transition ( expected at 37.45@xmath46ghz ) of @xmath470.026jykms@xmath32 ( 3@xmath5 ) for a 150kms@xmath32 wide emission line .",
    "the estimation of molecular gas mass from co line intensity requires the application of an empirical calibration for m@xmath48/@xmath49 .",
    "for ease of comparison with other authors , we assume that the molecular gas in this source is optically thick and , apply the standard conversion factor m@xmath48/@xmath49=0.8m@xmath4(k kms@xmath32)@xmath32 , derived for ulirgs and smgs at intermediate redshifts and believed to be constant for such sources between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . using this conversion",
    "we determine an upper limit on the molecular gas at @xmath52 of m(h@xmath2)@xmath3m@xmath4 ( 3@xmath5 ) .",
    "we note that the conversion has not yet been demonstrated for low mass galaxies forming stars at a relatively low rate , at significantly sub - solar metallicities metallicities , or at early times , for which a higher conversion factor may be more appropriate . applying the galactic conversion factor , m@xmath48/@xmath49=4.6m@xmath4(k kms@xmath32)@xmath32 ,",
    "would yield limits a factor of 5.75 times weaker than those presented here .",
    "the true value of the conversion factor is unknown but likely to lie somewhere between these extremes ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "we quantify the number density of continuum sources in our field , considering a circular region extending from the pointing centre to the radius at which primary beam attenuation limits sensitivity to 40% of its maximum value ( 47@xmath28 ) , yielding a survey area of @xmath53deg@xmath54 . we detect a single unresolved 5@xmath5 source in our 4ghz - bandwidth continuum image , with a peak flux @xmath55@xmath0jy , determined by fitting an gaussian point source to the image data .",
    "the source lies 33 arcseconds to the south - east of the grb host galaxy .",
    "two other features in the continuum map occur at 3@xmath5 relative to the local noise level .    in each case , several faint galaxies are visible at the source location in available deep @xmath56 and @xmath57 band imaging of the field ( see section  [ sec : lineemitter ] ) but the large beam size of the atca at 39ghz prevents secure identification of the correct near - infrared counterpart ( if any ) or determination of an accurate redshift . none of the three continuum sources show evidence for strong line emission in the frequency range observed .",
    "in principle we are sensitive to any emission line source appearing in the telescope primary beam and in our 36 - 40ghz frequency range . in practice",
    ", this region of the spectrum is largely devoid of significant lines from galactic or low redshift sources @xcite .",
    "the only strong features seen from galactic sources in this frequency range ( i.e. emission lines without comparable - strength neighbouring lines ) are high order transitions in methanol masers , which are usually highly polarised and associated with high mass star formation regions",
    ".    there are only three credible extragalactic interpretations of an emission line occurring at these high frequencies .",
    "we are sensitive to co(1 - 0 ) line emission occurring at @xmath58 , co(2 - 1 ) at @xmath59 and co(3 - 2 ) line emission at @xmath60 .",
    "the data cube obtained contains spectral information for any source lying within the primary beam of the atca .",
    "we rigorously inspected our data cube for emission line candidates lying within 47@xmath28 of the pointing ( and hence phase ) centre .",
    "as in the case of the grb host galaxy , we consider the data rebinned in frequency on scales ranging from 16 to 126kms@xmath32 per spectral resolution element , searching both for particularly narrow line emission and for weaker but broader emission lines .",
    "clear detections at the same spatial location in three or more adjacent channels were required to identify an emission line candidate .",
    "while pattern noise in the reduced images often creates strong peaks in the noise distribution , these are limited to one spectral channel , and noise peaks in adjacent channels appear spatially offset from one another .",
    "we identify a single strong emission line source in our spectral data cube , centered at 37.164ghz as shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the best fitting gaussian line profile has a peak flux of @xmath61mjy and a velocity full width at half - maximum of 96kms@xmath32 , yielding an integrated line flux @xmath62jykms@xmath32 , accounting for primary beam attenuation .",
    "the line flux is not significantly polarised ( although we note that at this low signal to noise there is large flux uncertainty in each polarisation ) . the source , located at 09@xmath2255@xmath2335@xmath2496 + 18@xmath2508@xmath2624@xmath277 , is not detected in 8 mm continuum emission .        as discussed above ,",
    "three plausible redshifts exist for this source : @xmath63 , 5.20 and 8.31 , corresponding to the first three rotational transitions of the carbon monoxide molecule . due to the offset between redshift , luminosity distance and intrinsic line flux for these three transitions , our observations reach comparable mass sensitivities in all three lines : 1.0 , 1.1 and 0.98 @xmath64m@xmath4 in molecular gas respectively ( assuming m@xmath48/@xmath49=0.8 as discussed in section  [ sec : grbhost ] ) .",
    "since the galaxy almost certainly does not fill our @xmath65 beam , a detailed calculation of the dynamical mass is not possible with the current data , and , in fact , it is not clear whether the line width is actually diagnostic of ordered rotation in sources of this type .",
    "however , while narrow , the emission line velocity width is consistent with the calculated gas mass if the molecular gas is distributed in a virialised disk one arcsecond in diameter at @xmath12 ( 0.6arcseconds at @xmath66 ) , seen close to face - on .",
    "given the hierarchical model for galaxy formation , and in the absence of additional information on large scale structure in this field , our _ a priori _ most likely interpretation has to be that this is an intermediate - mass star forming galaxy at @xmath63 . such a galaxy would typically be easily detected in deep optical ( @xmath67 in similar mass examples , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and near - infrared data , although the presence of significant amounts of dust could lead to the absence of a counterpart ( as is the case for submillimetre luminous galaxies ) .",
    "higher redshift sources would typically be both fainter and bluer in the near - infrared .    in figure",
    "[ fig : images ] we show existing deep near - infrared imaging of the region from _ hst_/wfc3 ( p.i .",
    "tanvir , analysis in prep ) .",
    "this data reaches a limit of @xmath68 ( ab , @xmath69 ) in a @xmath70 aperture and was obtained in order to study the host galaxy of grb090423 .",
    "near - infrared data of this depth and quality is rare .",
    "figure [ fig : images ] demonstrates the high - surface density of faint sources in such data , and hence the difficulty of assigning an unambiguous counterpart to the line emitter .",
    "the ambiguity is further heightened by uncertainties in the pointing accuracy of the atca . at millimetre wavelengths ,",
    "the telescope is used in reference pointing mode , with a nearby calibrator ( pks0953 + 254 in this case ) used to check and refine the pointing solution once an hour throughout observations .",
    "typical corrections at the end of each hour s observations were of order a few arcseconds , and rarely exceeded half the size of the synthesized beam .",
    "given this uncertainty , there are five near - infrared sources , well - detected in both bands , which may represent a counterpart for the line emission source , as well as a number of low - surface brightness features at the noise level of the data .",
    "the @xmath71 colours of these sources are insufficient to provide a redshift estimate , although we note with interest that the faint unresolved point source closest to the centre of the line emission ( marked ` 1 ' in figure [ fig : images ] ) shows very blue near - infrared colours ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) , a trait typical of high redshift ( @xmath10 ) galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and difficult to obtain for normal stellar populations at lower redshift .",
    "further data will be needed to unambiguously confirm the redshift of this source , and in the absence of such data , a tentative identification as co(1 - 0 ) emission from a faint @xmath63 starburst galaxy remains the most likely interpretation .",
    "a typical l@xmath74 lyman break galaxy at @xmath75 is believed to have a stellar mass of a few @xmath76m@xmath4 @xcite , although considerable uncertainties ( primarily stellar population synthesis model used , metallicity , photometric uncertainty and the deblending of faint , confused sources ) remain in this calculation .",
    "this is very comparable to the median stellar mass determined for grb host galaxies at @xmath77 ( @xmath78m@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and little evolution in this is seen to much higher redshifts either directly @xcite or in semi - analytic simulations tuned to match the observed distribution at @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "our constraint on the mass of molecular gas in the host galaxy of grb090423 requires m@xmath80 to be within a factor of a few of this expected stellar mass for grb hosts , suggesting either that the grb host is less massive than those typical at lower redshift or that its star formation is already well advanced , i.e. that it must be at least a third of the way through its starburst process , assuming 100% efficiency in the conversion of gas to stars .",
    "this tight limit is sensitive to gas not only in the host galaxy itself , but in the @xmath36kpc region encompassed by the synthesised beam of the observations . as a result",
    "the upper limit includes gas infalling on or recently ejected from a star forming galaxy , and in any close neighbours .",
    "as such it is somewhat surprising that a galaxy that is likely the progenitor of a much more massive low redshift system has such a limited fuel supply available for later and ongoing star formation .",
    "while no data is currently available on the current star formation rate of this source , it is instructive to consider a crude model in which the host galaxy is typical of lower redshift grb hosts ( i.e. m@xmath81m@xmath4 ) and star formation began at @xmath82 ( during the epoch of reionisation ) , yielding a a stellar population age of 240myr and a continuous star formation rate of 4m@xmath4yr@xmath32 ( comparable to the median of 3.8m@xmath4yr@xmath32 found in the grb host sample of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model",
    ", the host galaxy will exhaust its fuel supply by @xmath83 at the current rate of star formation .",
    "if the host is less massive or star formation began earlier ( and hence the average star formation rate is lower ) the star formation epoch may extend to lower redshifts .",
    "we note that this conclusion is drawn from the assumption of an optically - thick thermalised , metal - enriched gas , and from a co to h@xmath2+he gas mass conversion factor that is calibrated on the most massive starbursts at intermediate redshifts .",
    "these assumptions may well be flawed on a number of levels . as mentioned in section  [ sec : grbhost ] , the applicability of a simple conversion ( widely known as the x - factor ) from co(1 - 0 ) luminosity to a gas mass has not been demonstrated at higher redshifts , or in galaxies with sub - ulirg star formation rates .",
    "the low m@xmath48/@xmath49 ratio in ulirgs is believed to arise from the presence of a galaxy - wide starburst in which the bulk of the interstellar medium is both dense and irradiated by star formation @xcite .",
    "if the grb host galaxy at @xmath34 is , like those at intermediate times , similar in character to @xmath43 lyman break galaxies in terms of mass , metallicity and star formation rate , then it is interesting to note that such systems do indeed seem to be galaxy - wide starbursts with high specific star formation rates @xcite and no evidence that the uv - luminous knots observed are merely super - starclusters embedded in a more massive , cooler medium @xcite .",
    "while this may argue in favour of the ulirg - like conversion ratio used in this paper , the low metallicity and comparitively low star formation rates of such sources may have the effect of increasing the ratio .",
    "this significant source of uncertainty must necessarily be addressed by later studies .",
    "although grb090423 is believed to be a population ii event and thus indicative of a metal enriched star forming population , the fraction of relatively pristine h@xmath2 gas in the outer regions of a galaxy at early times is likely to be higher , particularly well outside the star forming disk .",
    "our observations can not rule out the presence of a large reservoir of such gas , either in the host galaxy or in filaments surrounding it since this would likely not be reflected in the measured co luminosity .",
    "similarly , the conversion assumes a known ratio of emission in the higher order rotational lines to that in the co(1 - 0 ) fundamental transition . at high redshifts",
    ", the cosmic microwave background provides a minimum temperature for a typical galaxy , pushing the rotational excitation ladder of carbon monoxide to higher levels and hence reducing the measured flux in the lower excitation states .",
    "the effect of this is seen in the recent models of @xcite , which indicate that the highest surface density of sources to a given flux limit is seen in co(3 - 2 ) emission at low redshift and in co(5 - 4 ) emission by @xmath84 .",
    "future follow - up of this and similar sources with alma ( which , while having a more limited field of view , will access higher order co transitions ) may yield an indication of this effect and prove more successful in determining the precise source redshift and gas mass .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : lineemitter ] , our deep datacube probes cosmological volume in each of three redshift ranges . considering the region in which our flux sensitivity is @xmath2940% of that at the pointing centre yields a field of view of @xmath53deg@xmath54 , while the 4ghz bandwidth yields a line of sight depth of @xmath85 , 0.59 and 0.88 at @xmath66 , 5 and 8 respectively .",

[",
    "fig : models ] ]    given a single emission line source ( with redshift yet to be determined ) we are able to place an upper limit on the surface density of co - luminous galaxies in each of these redshift ranges . our constraints are shown in figure [ fig : models ] , together with the predicted surface densities of sources with @xmath86jykms@xmath32 ( i.e. to a flux limit matching our detection of a single possible line ) determined from the _ s - cubed _ simulations of @xcite .",
    "these analyse a conical section through the millennium simulation , applying a semi - analytic prescription to calculate the predicted co rotation emission line excitation ladder and h@xmath2 gas properties associated with about @xmath87 dark matter haloes .",
    "as figure [ fig : models ] demonstrates , very few @xmath12 galaxies in the simulation would satisfy our flux selection limit in the co(3 - 2 ) line ( the simulation field of view at @xmath12 is about @xmath88degrees@xmath89 ) , and hence the uncertainty on the predicted number densities is dominated by small number statistics .",
    "interestingly , regardless of which line identification is considered most likely , our detection of a co - emitting source is something of a surprise . given these simulations , and in the absence of lensing , we might expect to have detected either a @xmath6 co(1 - 0 ) emission line or a @xmath7 co(2 - 1 ) emission line of this strength in one of 35 blind atca pointings .",
    "it is possible that one of the intermediate redshift galaxies visible in figure [ fig : images ] is a lensing source , boosting the flux of a @xmath66 or @xmath84 background galaxy , or that we have chanced across rare large scale structure at these redshifts .",
    "the probability of a randomly selected pointing detecting a @xmath12 galaxy in co emission is considerably lower ( approximately one in two thousand ) .",
    "however this field is not randomly selected . in the unlikely event that follow - up investigations confirm the very blue ( @xmath90 ) faint galaxy as a @xmath12 near - infrared counterpart to the emission line source",
    ", this field would host both a gamma ray burst and a more massive gas - rich source ( separated by a projected distance of 200kpc ) , representing a highly significant overdensity above the typical galaxy distribution at this redshift and suggesting that grbs are indeed effective tracers of large scale structure at high redshift .",
    "while constraints from a single grb and associated field remain weak , such a detection might argue against the suppression of star formation in low mass haloes seen in warm dark matter models , as discussed by @xcite which are expected to yield both fewer high redshift grbs and fewer star forming galaxies associated with them .",
    "even by @xmath12 , the effects of cosmic variance can be significant .",
    "@xcite have suggested a two order of magnitude variation in the density of 0.5mpc@xmath91 regions at this redshift , based on large n - body simulations probing structure formation during reionisation .",
    "given the significant expenditure of telescope time necessary to obtain deep imaging suitable for exploring the @xmath34 universe , exploring underdense regions is likely to be both disappointing and uninformative .",
    "following up grb fields ( should additional @xmath14 bursts be identified ) may well be the most efficient method for identifying the high density regions that are the sites for later massive galaxy and cluster formation .",
    "we have observed the host galaxy of grb090423 and its immediate environs at radio frequencies ( 36.1 - 39.7ghz ) , in order to search for molecular gas emission in the co(3 - 2 ) line .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "no continuum source was seen at the grb location in the multi - frequency synthesis image , allowing us to place an upper limit on the 37.9ghz flux of this source of @xmath1=9.3@xmath0jy ( 3@xmath5 , assuming the source is unresolved ) .",
    "no line emission is detected from the grb090423 host galaxy . applying standard conversion factors , we determine an upper limit on the molecular gas in this @xmath52 source of m(h@xmath2)@xmath3m@xmath4 ( 3@xmath5 ) .",
    "this tight limit on the fuel for star formation suggests either that the grb host is less massive than those seen at lower redshift , or that its starburst is well advanced .",
    "we caution that this conclusion depends critically on the assumptions required to calculate gas masses , which are not yet well calibrated at high redshift .",
    "we identify a single strong emission line source in our data , centered at 37.164ghz and 44 arcseconds to the south - west of the grb .",
    "the emission has a peak flux of @xmath92mjy and a velocity full width at half - maximum of 96kms@xmath32 .",
    "this corresponds to a molecular gas mass of 1.0 , 1.1 or 0.98 @xmath64m@xmath4 if interpreting the line as co(1 - 0 ) at @xmath6 , co(2 - 1 ) at @xmath7 or co(3 - 2 ) at @xmath8 respectively .",
    "efforts to identify and characterise a counterpart to this emission line source are continuing .",
    "flux limits given in sections 2 and 3 are obtained from data that has been ` cleaned ' using miriad .",
    "further inspection and consultation with atca staff suggests a less vigorous cleaning strategy may be appropriate .",
    "this would result in an effective increase in the image noise , and hence quoted flux and mass constraints , by a factor of two ( @xmath353 if cleaning is omitted completely from the data reduction ) .",
    "quoted fluxes for the line emission candidate are unaffected , and there is no substantive impact on our discussion or science conclusions .",
