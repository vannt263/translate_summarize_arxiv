    "recent theoretical ideas @xcite connecting the baryon asymmetry and dark - matter density could also have implications for cips . in any case",

    "more recently , it has been shown that cips would modulate the cmb anisotropies produced by adiabatic perturbations , both by inducing anisotropies in the optical depth to reionization @xcite , and more dramatically , by changing the silk damping length of the cmb in regions of sky containing a cip @xcite .",
    "this modulation would induce a specific pattern of higher order - correlations in the temperature and polarization anisotropies , analogous to those induced by variations of other cosmological parameters @xcite , and by weak gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "this signature can be exploited to construct estimators for the cip perturbation @xcite .",
    "cips generated in curvaton models for the primordial density fluctuation @xcite , lower - energy inflationary models @xcite , and perhaps other scenarios , are within the range of detectability for a cosmic - variance - limited cmb polarization experiment .",
    "our motivation for studying cips , however is here one of curiosity : if pre - existing limits are so permissive , it behooves us to actually check if baryons and dark matter trace one another in the early universe !",
    "here , we use wmap 9-year temperature maps to search for cips . our cip estimator is based on the full non - gaussian trispectrum of the observed cmb multipole moments , and can be used to perform either a model - independent reconstruction of the cip power spectrum @xmath13 , or to measure the amplitude of a scale - invariant spectrum of cips .",
    "we impose a @xmath0-confidence upper limit of @xmath1 to the amplitude of a scale - invariant spectrum of cips , as well as model - independent constraints of @xmath14 to the root - mean - squared ( rms ) amplitude of the cip power spectrum at angular scales in the range @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the multipole index of the cip .",
