    "coherent population transfer among discrete quantum states in atoms and molecules has attracted tremendous attentions@xcite over the past decades , due to its potential application to atomic optics@xcite , preparation of entanglement@xcite and quantum computation@xcite . the most robust technique for achieving efficient population transfer",
    "is stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap)@xcite , by which perfect population transfer has been studied in a three - level @xmath0 system particularly .",
    "moreover , the case when the upper isolated discrete level is replaced with a continuum was suggested initially by carroll and hioe@xcite . in their model ,",
    "the continuum could serve as an intermediary for population transfer between two discrete states in an atom or a molecule by stirap .",
    "however , complete population transfer is unrealistic , significant partial transfer may still be feasible@xcite .",
    "recently , there is great interest in extending these studies to semiconductor nanostructures@xcite for the possible implementation of optoelectronic devices . in the conduction band of semiconductor quantum structure , the confined electron gas exhibits atomiclike behaviors .",
    "the intersubband energies and electron wave function symmetries could be engineered , with a flexibility unknown in atomic systems , to suit particular requirements .",
    "therefore , several quantum optical coherence and interference effects have been investigated within intersubband transitions of semiconductor quantum wells(qws ) , such as electromagnetically induced transparency(eit)@xcite , tunneling - induced transparency@xcite , enhancement of kerr nonlinearity@xcite , ultrafast all - optical switching@xcite , four - wave mixing@xcite , rabi osillations@xcite , and coherent population trapping(cpt)@xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we design a n - doped asymmetric algaas / gaas double qw with a continuum(fig .",

    "it is well known that , for an excited - doublet four - level atom system , the quantum interference effect can lead to depression or even cancellation of spontaneous emission from the excited doublet to the lower levels@xcite .",
    "considering above , some of us@xcite demonstrated that a complete population transfer from an initial state to another target state and an arbitrary superposition of atomic states could be realized with the stirap technique .",
    "however , the spontaneous decay is intrinsically incoherent in nature and detrimental to coherent population transfer , zhu _ _ et al.__@xcite investigated that the remarkable enhancement or suppression of population transfer can be realized through the spontaneous emission constructive or destructive quantum interference even with a finite pulse area .",
    "in contrast to the excited - doublet four - level atom , in our structure , the quantum tunneling to a continuum from the excited doublet could give rise to the fano - type interference@xcite , which has been observed experimentally in semiconductor intersubband transitions@xcite and the sign of quantum interference ( constructive or destructive ) in optical absorption can be reversed by varying the direction of tunneling from the excited doublet to a common continuum@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present paper , we will analyze the controllability of the coherent electron population transfer in the four - subband double qw structure via tuning the sign of quantum interference due to resonant tunneling , the splitting of the excited doublet ( the coupling strength of the tunneling ) , and the fano - type interference . by numerically solving the motion equations of element moments , the almost complete electron population transfer between qws",
