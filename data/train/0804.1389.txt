    "it has been suggested@xcite that the use of collective systems like a magnet can reduce the intrinsic switching energy ( that is dissipated throughout switching ) significantly compared to that required for individual spins .",
    "there is also a lot of experimental effort@xcite at this time to implement switching circuits based on magnets .",
    "there has been some work @xcite on modeling magnetic circuits like mqca s in the atomic scale using quantum density matrix equation but most of the work @xcite is in the classical regime using the well known micromagnetic simulators ( oommf ) based on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) @xcite equation .",
    "this paper too is based on the llg equation , but our focus is not on obtaining the energy requirement of any specific device in a particular simulation .",
    "rather it is to obtain generic results that can guide the design of magnet based switching circuits as well as providing a basis for comparison with alternative technologies .",
    "+ the results we present are obtained by analyzing the cascadable switching scheme illustrated in fig.1 where the magnet to be switched ( magnet 2 ) is first placed along its hard axis by a magnetic pulse ( see ` mid state ' in fig.1 ) .",
    "on removing the pulse , it falls back into one of its low energy states ( up or down ) determined by the ` bias ' provided by magnet 1 .",
    "what makes this scheme specifically suited for logic operations is that it puts magnet 2 into a state determined by magnet 1 ( thereby transferring information ) , but the energy needed to switch magnet 2 comes largely from the external pulse _ and not from magnet 1_. this is similar to conventional electronic circuits where the energy needed to charge a capacitor comes from the power supply , although the information comes from the previous capacitors .",
    "this feature seems to be an essential ingredient needed to _ cascade logic units_. to our knowledge , the switching scheme shown in fig.1 was first discussed by bennett @xcite and is very similar to the schemes described in many recent publications ( see e.g likharev et.al @xcite , kummamuru et.al@xcite and csaba et.al @xcite ) .",

    "one is that the switching energy drops significantly as the ramp time @xmath0 of the magnetic pulse exceeds a critical time @xmath1 given by equation .",
    "this is similar to the drop in the switching energy of an rc circuit when @xmath2 .",
    "but the analogy is only approximate since the switching energy for magnets drops far more abruptly with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the significance of @xmath1 is that it tells us how slow a pulse needs to be in order to qualify as `` adiabatic '' and thereby reduce dissipation significantly .",
    "considering typical magnets used in the magnetic storage industry , and using ramp times of a few @xmath1 , intrinsic switching frequency of 100 mhz to 1 ghz can easily be in the adiabatic regime of switching where dissipation is very small .",
    "+ interestingly , we find that the switching energy for the trapezoidal pulses investigated in this paper in both the ` fast ' and ` slow ' limits can be described by a single equation which is the other central result of this paper . later in this paper (  [ s6 ] ) we will discuss how equations and can be used to guide scaling and increase switching speeds . furthermore these equations can be used to compare magnet based switching circuits with alternative technologies .",
    "+ it has to be emphasized that dissipation of the external circuitry also has to be evaluated for any new technology .",
    "a careful evaluation would require a consideration of actual circuitry to be used ( see e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however following nikonov et.al .",
    "@xcite , if a wire coil is used to produce the pulse , we can estimate the energy dissipated in creating the field @xmath3 as @xmath4 in cgs system of units .",
    "@xmath5 is the quality factor of the circuit and @xmath6 is the volume over which the field extends .",
    "depending on q , v and @xmath3 the dissipated energy can be much larger , comparable to or much smaller than @xmath7 which sets the energy scale for the effects considered here in this paper .",
    "+ _ overview of the paper _ : as mentioned before our results are based on direct numerical simulation of the llg equation .",
    "however we find that in two limiting cases , it is possible to calculate switching energy simply using the energetics of magnetization and these limiting results are described in sections  [ s3 ] ( dissipation with fast pulse ) and  [ s5 ] ( dissipation with adiabatic pulse ) which are related to equation . in  [ s6 ]",
    "we use the llg equation to show that the switching energy drops sharply for ramp times larger than the critical time given by equation . in section ",
    "[ s7 ] using coupled llg equations we analyze a chain of inverters to show that the total dissipation increases linearly with the number of nanomagnets thus making it reasonable to use the one - magnet results in our paper to evaluate complex circuits , at least approximately . finally in section  [ s8 ] practical issues such as dissipation versus speed , increasing the switching speed and scaling are qualitatively discussed in the light of these results . +",
    "before we get into the discussion of switching energy , let us briefly review the energetics of a magnet .",
    "the energy of a magnet with an effective second order uniaxial anisotropy can be described by @xmath9 where @xmath10 measures the deflection from the easy axis which we take as the @xmath11 axis .",
    "all isotropic terms have been omitted because they do not affect dynamics and hence dissipation of the magnet @xcite .",
    "there are two magnetic fields that control the switching ( see fig.[front ] ) : the external pulse @xmath3 and the bias field @xmath12 due to the neighboring magnet . including the internal energy and the interaction energy of magnetic moment with external fields",
    ", the energy equation reads @xmath13 @xmath14 is the saturation magnetization .",
    "if the unit volume is magnetized to saturation , @xmath14 is equivalent to the magnetic moment per unit volume .",
    "@xmath15 is a unit vector in the direction of magnetization .",
    "v is the volume of the magnet and @xmath16 is the second order anisotropy constant with dimensions of energy per unit volume .",
    "the applied field @xmath3 is along the hard axis @xmath17 , the bias field @xmath12 is along the easy axis @xmath18 so the energy equation becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 is defined as in a standard spherical coordinate system .",
    "using equation [ energy ] we will show that dissipation with a fast pulse ( small ramp time ) can be written as    [ disspulsenohdc ] @xmath21    for reasons to be explained , under the condition of equation [ lower ] , logic device will not work .",
    "nevertheless it is useful for determining dissipation in the adiabatic limit . in the equations above",
    ", @xmath22 is the minimum field necessary to put the magnet along its hard axis .",
    "notice that the bias field @xmath12 is a dc field coming from the neighboring magnet . in practice ,",
    "whether the bias field is a dc field or not , its magnitude has to be bigger than noise such that when the magnet is put along its hard axis as in fig.[front ] , the bias field can deterministically tilt the magnet towards its direction",

    "each magnet has two stable states showed as _ up _ and _ down _ in the figure .",
    "we want to switch magnet 2 according to the state of magnet 1 .",
    "first consider only magnets 1 and 2 .",
    "we ve already explained ( see section  [ s1 ] ) how magnet 1 can determine the final state of magnet 2 .",
    "but what happens if more magnets are present ?",
    "+ consider magnets 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "just like magnet 1 , magnet 3 also exerts a field on magnet 2 and if it is in the opposite direction can cancel out the field of magnet 1 . to overcome this",
    ", we apply the pulse to magnet 3 as well thereby diminishing the exerted @xmath11 field of magnet 3 on magnet 2 so that magnet 1 becomes the sole decider of the final state of magnet 2 . in the process",
    "the data in magnet 3 has been destroyed ( it will end up wherever magnet 4 decides ) .",
    "it takes 3 pulses to transfer the bit ( in an inverted manner ) in magnet 1 to magnet 4 .",
    "magnet 4 has been included because it affects the dissipation of magnet 3 through affecting its dynamics .",
    "inclusion of more magnets to the right or left of the array will not change the quantitative or qualitative results of this paper .",
    "next we ll briefly go over the method used to simulate the chain of inverters .",
    "equations [ llgn ] ( with @xmath134 ) and [ dissipated energy ] are used to simulate the dynamics and dissipation of each magnet respectively .",
    "the overall scaled ( divided by @xmath38 ) magnetic field @xmath135 of equation [ llgn ] for each magnet at each instant of time is modified to @xmath136 composed of the applied pulse : @xmath137 the anisotropy ( internal ) field of each magnet : @xmath138 and exerted dipolar fields of other magnets which in general in cgs system of units reads @xmath139 all field values are time dependent . here",
    "@xmath140 denotes any one magnet and @xmath141 runs over magnetic moments of the other magnets . though this equation can be simplified for an array of magnets along the same line , in this form it can be used for more complicated arrangement of magnets .",
    "fig.[invchaindiss]b shows the llg simulations of the chain of inverters where magnet 2 is switched solely according to the state of magnet 1 irrespective of its history or the state of magnets 3 and 4 .",
    "fig.[invchaindiss]c shows dissipation of the entire array after one application of the pulse as a function of ramp time .",
    "the pulse is exerted on magnets 2 and 3 which accounts for the @xmath142 value in the fast limit .",
    "this essentially points out that after cascading these logic building blocks , dissipation changes linearly with the number of magnets .",
    "+ in the slow limit , depending on the initial configuration , dissipation will be affected .",
    "the 4 magnet array can initially be in any of its 16 possible states .",
    "some configurations saturate and some do nt . here",
    "the field of magnet 1 plays the role of the bias field @xmath12 for magnet 2 and the field of magnet 4 is like another bias field on magnet 3 which accounts for the 3 groups of curves in fig.[invchaindiss]c .",
    "the upper curves correspond to the situation where initial magnetization of both magnets 2 and 3 are opposite to the fields exerted from magnets 1 and 4 respectively .",
    "the middle curves correspond to only one of magnets 2 or 3 initially being opposite to the exerted fields of magnet 1 or 4 respectively .",
    "the lower curves correspond to both magnets 1 and 3 initially being in the same direction as the exerted fields from magnets 2 and 4 respectively . + an added complication is the field of the other neighbor ( magnet 3 ) which is diminished in the @xmath11 direction but has a non - negligible @xmath143 component exerted on magnet 2 .",
    "all this @xmath143 directed field does is to wash away a tiny bit the effect of the field of magnet 1 which has little bearing on the qualitative or quantitative results as illustrated in fig.[invchaindiss]c .",
    "the speed of switching can be increased by increasing the magnitude of the external pulse @xmath3 above @xmath38 .",
    "larger fields will dissipate more energy but have the advantage of aligning the magnet faster during the turn - on segment but are of no use for increasing the speed of the turn - off segment because the magnet relaxes to its stable state under its own internal field . if @xmath144 can be altered , then it is a better idea to increase @xmath38 and always set @xmath27 . this way",
    "the speed of switching is increased by shortening the time of both turn - on and turn - off segments .",
    "+      consider equation ( [ tau_c importance ] ) .",
    "increasing @xmath115 shortens the switching time constant ( note that @xmath115 is usually less than 1 ) ; however this parameter is not very controllable in experiments .",
    "@xmath145 is a physical constant and can not be altered .",
    "so to increase the switching speed , one has to increase @xmath144 .",
    "thermal stability of a magnet requires @xmath7 to be larger than a certain amount for the desired retention time .",
    "for instance with an attempt frequency of about 1ghz ( see the discussion at the end of  [ s5 ] ) and @xmath7 of about 0.5 ev , magnet is stable for about 0.5 seconds which is large enough because switching takes place in the nano - second scale .",
    "a higher retention time requires higher @xmath7 .",
    "once @xmath7 is set because of stability requirements , the only way to increase @xmath38 is to decrease @xmath146 .",
    "assuming that volume is magnetized to saturation , @xmath147 is the magnetic moment of the magnet .",
    "@xmath148 is the number of spins giving rise to the magnetization and @xmath149 is bohr magneton .",
    "so decreasing @xmath146 translates to making the magnet smaller or decreasing its saturation magnetization .",
    "+ the discussion just presented is similar to the theory of scaling in cmos technology where decreasing the capacitance causes an increase in the switching speed by decreasing the @xmath150 time constant . with the same operating voltage , smaller capacitance results in lower number of charges stored on the capacitor . in the case of cmos , as @xmath151 decreases , energy dissipated i.e. @xmath152 also decreases . in the case of magnet however , energy dissipation is fixed around @xmath52 so for a lower @xmath146 , dissipation of the ferro - magnetic logic element ( already very small ) is _ not _ altered ; however one might be able to reduce the dissipated energy in the external circuitry since it needs to provide the energy for a shorter period of time .",
    "again we should emphasize that a thorough analysis of external dissipation also has to be done .",
    "this has to do with generating the external source of energy for switching . in the case of mqca circuits",
    "this is done by running currents through wires and generating magnetic fields . in principle , spin transfer torque phenomena or electrically controlled multi - ferroicity could also be used to provide the source of energy .",
    "these methods would also have energy dissipation associated with them .",
    "a complete lay - out circuit is necessary to properly evaluate the integration density of logic circuits made of magnets .",
    "for example fringing fields and unwanted cross talks have to be taken into account .",
    "external circuitry will take up space .",
    "efficient methods have to be developed to porperly address these issues .",
    "one component of the lay - out is the magnetic logic bit itself which we discuss here .",
    "the barrier height @xmath153 between the stable states of a magnet can be engineered by adjusting @xmath16 ( anisotropy constant ) and @xmath6 ( volume ) . increasing the anisotropy constant is of great interest for the magnetic storage industry because it allows stable magnets of smaller volume that translates to higher densities .",
    "many experiments report @xmath16 values on the order of a few @xmath154@xcite .",
    "this results in stable magnets with volumes of only 10s of @xmath155 ; which means that stable magnets can be made as small as a few @xmath156 in each dimension . even though a complete lay - out is necessary , nevertheless these numbers are very promising and could potentially result in very high integration densities .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the switching energy of single domain nanomagnets used as cascadable logic building blocks .",
    "a magnetic pulse was used to provide the energy for switching and a bias field was used as an input to guide the switching .",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn from this study .",
    "+ ( 1 ) through analyzing the complete dependence of the switching energy on ramp time of the pulse , it was concluded that there is a significant and sharp drop in dissipation for ramp times that exceed a critical time given by equation [ tau_c importance ] whose significance is separating the energy dissipation characteristic of a fast pulse ( small ramp time ) and energy dissipation characteristic of a slow pulse ( big ramp time ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) the switching energy can be described by a single equation ( equation [ general ] ) in both fast and slow limits for trapezoidal pulses analyzed in this paper . in the fast limit",
    "the effect of the bias field or equivalently the field of neighboring magnet in mqca systems is negligible so long as the bias field is less than 10th of the switching field of the magnet . in the slow limit",
    "however , dissipation is largely determined by the value of the bias field .",
    "+ ( 3 ) by evaluating switching energy of both one magnet and a chain of inverters for mqca systems , it was shown that the switching energy increases linearly with the number of magnets so that the one magnet results provided in this paper can be used to calculate the switching energy of larger more complicated circuits , at least approximately .",
    "+ ( 4 ) practical issues such as dissipation versus speed , increasing the switching speed and scaling were discussed qualitatively .",
    "it was concluded that by proper designing , ferromagnetic logic bits can have scaling laws similar to the cmos technology . + noise was not directly included in the models ; however we took it into account indirectly : thermal noise is the limiting factor on the anisotropy energy @xmath7 ( that determines the magnet s thermal stability ) of a magnet which we discussed thoroughly .",
    "thermal noise also limits the lowest possible magnitude of the bias field ( or equivalently coupling between magnets in mqca systems ) .",
    "we ve provided the results for a wide range of bias values .",
    "more thorough discussions of dissipation in the external circuitry can be found in references @xcite,@xcite .",
