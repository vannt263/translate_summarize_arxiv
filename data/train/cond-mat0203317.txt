    "quantum - degenerate samples of low - density fermionic atomic gases @xcite are arguably even more interesting than their bosonic counterparts @xcite , due to the fundamental role played by the pauli exclusion principle in their dynamics .",
    "this principle renders their experimental realization particularly difficult , since in the simplest case , the collisions that are essential in evaporative cooling largely disappear as the temperature of the sample goes to zero . for this reason ,",
    "more elaborate techniques , involving e.g. the use of several isotopes , or sympathetic cooling via a bosonic system , have been used to achieve degeneracy @xcite .",
    "collisions also leave behind holes in the fermi sea @xcite ; these holes are difficult to fill and are believed to limit the temperatures that can be achieved to about 0.2 @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the fermi temperature .    from a theoretical viewpoint",
    ", fermi systems also present a number of difficult challenges .",
    "in particular , they are not amenable to a mean - field description . hence they can not be analyzed in a classical - like formalism such as the gross - pitaevskii equation , which has proven remarkably powerful in describing many aspects of quantum - degenerate bosonic systems .",
    "on the other hand , the additional complexity of fermi systems also offers much promise . one can hope to be able to manipulate them into strongly non - classical states , with potential applications in atom interferometry .",
    "also , the nonlinear mixing of fermionic matter waves is expected to be very different from the bosonic case . as such",
    ", fermi systems promise the extension of nonlinear atom optics @xcite to a regime without counterpart in traditional nonlinear optics .",
    "just as is the case for bosons , a cornerstone of the manipulation of fermionic matter waves is their interaction with light . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the specific situation where transitions between two internal states of a trapped quantum - degenerate fermi system at zero temperature are induced by raman coupling .",
    "a straightforward generalization of this model could be used to describe an output coupler for an atom laser @xcite .",
    "our goal is two - fold : first , to understand the difference between the bosonic and fermionic dynamics ; and second , to determine the role of two - body collisions on the evolution of the system .",
    "we first consider the dynamics of the system in the absence of collisions .",
    "section [ sec : model ] introduces our model and derives the heisenberg equations of motion for the relevant atomic fields , and section iii compares the resulting dynamics with those for a corresponding bose gas .",
    "collisions are introduced in section iv .",
    "the resulting equations of motion are solved numerically in the framework of a time - dependent hartree - fock theory for the case of fermions , and in a standard mean - field theory for a bosonic sample .",
    "again , we give a detailed comparison of the two situations , and illustrate how collisions can change the fermionic dynamics in a non - trivial fashion . finally , section [ sec : summary ] is a summary and conclusion .",
    "we consider a two - component quantum - degenerate atomic system trapped in a one - dimensional , harmonic potential with each component corresponding , e.g. , to one internal hyperfine spin state . in general , the coupling of the atoms to the trapping field is different for the two ( spin ) components @xmath2 and @xmath3 , so that they see trapping potentials of different frequencies @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the two internal states are coupled by a raman - type interaction of frequency @xmath6 equal to the spin - flip transition frequency of the atoms in the ground state of the two trapping potentials .",
    "this model , which is summarized on the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] , is described by the second - quantized hamiltonian     and @xmath5 correspond to the two internal states , which are coupled via a spin - flip transition at frequency @xmath6 resonant with the frequency difference of the trap ground states .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ]    @xmath7,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the raman coupling strength .",
    "the first - quantized hamiltonian describing the trapping potentials associated with the internal states @xmath2 and @xmath3 is @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the energy of the internal state @xmath11 .",
    "the raman resonance condition is therefore , with @xmath12 , @xmath13    we remark that this resonance condition effects only the coupling between the two trap ground states : the coupling between all other levels is off - resonant for @xmath14 .",
    "hence , introducing a small detuning even for the ground states does not significantly alter the dynamics of the system .",
    "the atomic field operators corresponding to the two traps obey the fermionic , respectively bosonic ( anti)commutation relations @xmath15_\\pm & = & \\delta_{ij}\\delta(x - x ' ) , \\nonumber\\\\ \\left[\\hat{\\psi}_i(x),\\hat{\\psi}_j(x')\\right]_\\pm & = & 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\left[\\hat{\\psi}_i^\\dagger(x),\\hat{\\psi}_j^\\dagger(x')\\right]_\\pm & = & 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 .    for the harmonic potentials at hand , the heisenberg equations of motion for the atomic field operators",
    "take the same form , independently of whether the atoms are bosonic or fermionic .",
    "it is convenient to expand them in terms of eigenstates @xmath17 of one of the trap hamiltonians @xmath18 , say , @xmath19 for concreteness , as @xmath20 where the @xmath21 s and @xmath22 s satisfy either fermionic or bosonic commutation relations . in both cases ,",
    "this expansion readily yields the heisenberg equations of motion @xmath23 where we have introduced the coefficients @xmath24 and the ratio @xmath25 of the trap frequencies .",
    "the dimensionless time @xmath26 is scaled to @xmath4 , @xmath27 , and so is the dimensionless coupling strength @xmath28 .",
    "we emphasize that while the operator @xmath21 describes the annihilation of atoms in level @xmath29 of the upper trap , a similar interpretation of the @xmath22 s is not possible , since they result from the expansion of the field operator of atoms in the internal state @xmath3 on the basis of the `` + ' ' -trap . denoting the eigenstates of the single - atom hamiltonian of the lower trap as @xmath30 , the `` true '' annihilation operators @xmath31 associated with the trapped atoms in the @xmath3 internal state are related to the @xmath22 s by the mapping @xmath32 where the mapping matrix element @xmath33 is the overlap integral @xmath34",
    "in this section , we compare the dynamics of ideal noninteracting bosonic and fermionic systems evolving under the influence of the raman coupling .",
    "we proceed by numerically solving the heisenberg equations of motion ( [ equ : finalsame ] ) for a sample of @xmath35 atoms initially in the internal state @xmath2 and at temperature @xmath36 . for bosonic atoms ,",
    "all atoms are therefore initially in the `` + ' ' -trap ground state , while for fermions they fill the lowest @xmath35 trap levels .",
    "the corresponding initial states are correspondingly @xmath37 in the case of fermions , and @xmath38 for bosonic atoms .",
    "we consider , first , the case of noninteracting fermionic atoms . for trap frequencies approximately equal , @xmath39 , eq . ( [ equ : finalsame ] ) suggests the existence of two limiting situations , at least in the case of fermions .",
    "( we will revisit this point when discussing low - temperature bosonic systems . ) in the first one , which we call the `` strong - coupling regime '' in the following , @xmath40 , so that the inter - trap coupling dominates the dynamics and the intra - trap coupling terms @xmath41 can largely be ignored .",
    "in contrast , the `` weak - coupling regime '' @xmath42 is dominated by intra - trap coupling .    as a first measure of the system dynamics , fig .",

    "one can gain some intuitive understanding of the strong - coupling regime by remarking that in that regime , intra - trap transitions remain small , so that the raman coupling is predominantly between levels of the two traps with equal quantum number @xmath29 .",
    "to lowest order , these transitions are all at the rabi frequency @xmath44",
    ". however , this simplest description can not explain the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2]a .",
    "rather , it is necessary to include at least their lowest - order corrections , i.e , @xmath45 such an @xmath29-dependence of rabi frequencies is known to lead to collapse and revival phenomena , as was first discussed in the context of the jaynes - cummings model @xcite , where @xmath46 .",
    "this is precisely the type of behavior exhibited by @xmath0 in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "because of the @xmath47-dependence of @xmath48 , it is expected that the lowest trap levels , i.e. the atoms in the deep fermi sea , play a dominant role in the appearance of the revivals .",
    "we verified that the populations of the lowest trap levels indeed oscillate more or less in phase , while those of higher @xmath29 levels dephase rapidly .",
    "we remark that both collapses and revivals of @xmath0 disappear when the two trap frequencies are identical , since for @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 and hence @xmath51 . in addition , intra - trap transitions vanish in that case , due to @xmath52 .     for @xmath53 fermions and trap ratio @xmath54 , as obtained from a numerical integration of eqs .",

    "we now briefly turn to the case of a bose gas . for a sample at zero - temperature , @xmath36 , and initially in the internal state @xmath2 , all atoms are in the ground state of the `` + ' ' -trap at @xmath60 . as a result",
    ", the strong - coupling regime is characterized by almost perfect rabi oscillations of the atomic population between the two trap ground states , with a very small fraction of the atoms coupling to higher modes due to intra - trap transitions .",
    "this behavior is also largely preserved for @xmath61 .",

    "the weak - coupling regime is not characterized by @xmath66 as is the case for fermions , but rather by @xmath67 .    as is to be expected ,",
    "the difference between fermionic and bosonic systems is reduced as @xmath68 is increased . at first , the sharp edge of the fermi - dirac distribution softens , resulting in slightly reduced ( strong - coupling ) collapses and revivals of the fermionic system . on the other hand , for @xmath69",
    ", bosons occupy higher trap states , resulting in a spread in rabi frequencies participating in the population difference signal .",
    "this in turn leads to collapses and revivals rather than the perfect @xmath36 rabi oscillations .",

    "they are essential in the evaporative cooling of the sample , and also provide a nonlinearity that can lead to the nonlinear mixing of matter waves . in bosonic systems , much new physics can be studied , e.g. by changing the sign of the scattering length of @xmath70-wave collisions . in the case of fermions",
    "the creation of holes in the fermi sea , and the filling of these holes by additional collisions results in a heating that appears to fundamentally limit the temperatures at which these samples can be cooled @xcite .",
    "first , we discuss the way collisions impact the operation of the raman coupler in the case of fermions , and later compare these results with those for a bosonic sample .",

    "the raman coupling between two internal states of a trapped fermi gas exhibits a rich dynamics , quite different from its bosonic counterpart .",

    "where the traps associated with the two internal states have different frequencies , the first of these regimes leads to dynamics characterized by collapses and revivals .",
