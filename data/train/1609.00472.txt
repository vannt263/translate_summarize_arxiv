    "investigation and development of low toxicity and eco - friendly green energetic ( primary , secondary explosives , oxidizers , and propellants ) materials become an emerging field of research during the last decade . especially , usage of green energetic oxidizers and propellants for pyrotechnic formulations prevents environmental pollution.@xcite ammonium perchlorate ( ap , nh@xmath3clo@xmath3 ) and ammonium nitrate ( an , nh@xmath3no@xmath4 ) are widely used energetic oxidizers .",
    "however , ap produces hcl as a combustion product ; for instance , 503 tonnes of propellant containing ap liberates 100 tonnes of hcl and other chlorine containing compounds during its burning , thereby causing  ozone layer depletion \" in the stratosphere.@xcite also , the large amount of hcl could cause  acid rain \" and high concentrations of perchlorate can affect the function of the thyroid gland.@xcite consequently , an was considered to be an environment - friendly alternative to ap but its extreme low enthalpy of formation and relatively low density prevents an usage in solid composite propellants ( scp).@xcite therefore , there is a significant interest in finding environmentally benign replacements for the extensively used ap and an .",
    "ammonium dinitramide ( adn , nh@xmath3n(no@xmath5)@xmath5 ) has been identified as a promising new green energetic oxidizer for solid rocket propellants because of the desirable properties namely low sensitivity of ammonium salts , high - performance characteristics of nitramine compounds , high oxygen balance and absence of chlorine atoms.@xcite apart from this , a shuttle can transport 8@xmath6 more mass into orbit by using adn as a propellant in place of ap.@xcite    on the other hand , high pressure / temperature polymorphs and structural phase transitions have much impact on the fundamental properties such as intermolecular interactions , chemical bonding , crystal structures , thermo - elastic properties of energetic molecular solids.@xcite two different energetic polymorphs display distinct energetic performance attributing different crystal density thereby changing in the detonation characteristics . therefore , there is a significant interest in understanding the phase stability and polymorphism of energetic materials under extreme conditions .",
    "extensive reports are available in the literature addressing the high temperature behavior and thermal decomposition of adn.@xcite russell et al@xcite reported the pressure - temperature ( p - t ) diagram of adn up to 10 gpa and 198 - 398 k and a reversible phase transition is observed from @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 at around 2.0 gpa .",
    "in contrast to the previous study,@xcite @xmath7-adn is found to be stable up to 4.03 gpa.@xcite to complement the experiments , atomistic simulations are an effective way to model the crystal structures and their physical @xmath0 chemical properties .",
    "zhu et al@xcite made a comparative study of electronic , vibrational and thermodynamic properties between ap and adn at ambient pressure .",
    "apart from this , sorescu et al@xcite investigated the structural and electronic properties of adn using plane wave pseudo potential approach at ambient as well as at high pressure ( 0 - 600 gpa ) without treating intermolecular interactions .",
    "they found that ambient phase of adn transforms to triclinic ( p@xmath10 ) structure around 10 gpa.@xcite however , the examined compound is an ionic - molecular solid and hence contribution towards intermolecular interaction from dispersion forces may be quite low but the ions are linked through hydrogen bonding networks .",
    "therefore , investigation of this material by treating intermolecular interactions at ambient as well as at moderate pressures is crucial to obtain a fundamental knowledge at the atomistic level . with this motivation , in the present work",
    ", we have studied the pressure dependent structural , elastic and vibrational properties of adn using dispersion corrected dft - d2 method .",
    "first principles calculations were accomplished with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method as implemented in vasp package.@xcite generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization was considered as the exchange - correlation functional to treat electron - electron interactions.@xcite structural and elastic properties were calculated by setting the convergence criteria below 1.0 @xmath11 10@xmath12 ev for total energies , residual forces to be less than 1.0 @xmath1110@xmath13 ev/@xmath14 and stresses are limited to 0.02 gpa . to treat the missing dispersion interactions ,",

    "the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) calculations were performed using plane wave pseudo potential ( pw - pp ) approach incorporated through castep package.@xcite norm conserving ( nc)@xcite pw - pps were used to calculate the lattice dynamical properties .",
    "a kinetic energy cutoff of 950 ev and 2@xmath150.04 @xmath16 separation of k - mesh according to the monkhorst - pack grid scheme were used in the calculations.@xcite the self - consistent energy convergence and maximum force between atoms were set to 5.0@xmath1110@xmath17 ev / atom and 0.01 ev/@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the maximum displacement and stress were set to be 5.0@xmath1110@xmath18 and 0.02 gpa , respectively .",
    "hirshfeld surfaces@xcite and 2d finger print maps@xcite are calculated using crystalexplorer 3.1.@xcite",
    "gilardi et al@xcite reported that adn crystallizes in the primitive monoclinic structure having space group @xmath19 with 4 molecules per unit cell at ambient conditions .",
    "the crystal structure and atomic labels corresponding to each inequivalent atom for one molecule present in the unit cell of adn are given in figure [ struct ] .",
    "in contrast to the two dimensional network of an , * ? ? ?",
    "* the hydrogen bonds in adn are directed tetrahedrally to form a three dimensional hydrogen bonded networks .",
    "adn contains two independent three dimensional networks of hydrogen bonds.@xcite the first one involves a hydrogen bonding chain propagating along c - axis by connecting one of the nitro group ( n3-o3a - o3b ) of the anion via o3a to hydrogen atoms h2 and h3 of the nh@xmath3 cation ( see figure [ adn - h]a ) . the second one associated with the anion",
    "consists of twisted o2a which is out of plane for the first nitro group of the anion to form hydrogen bonding through h1 , h4 atoms and the adjacent layers of cation form a helical structure along ` b'-axis ( see figure [ adn - h]b ) .",

    "+ represents an overestimation of equilibrium volume when compared to the experiments.@xcite overall , we find a good agreement between our calculated equilibrium volume using d2 and vdw - df methods when compared with the experiments and all the results are presented in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "further , the obtained ground state structures at ambient pressure using dft - d2 method were used to perform high pressure calculations in the pressure range 0 - 5 gpa in steps of 0.5 gpa .",
    "the computed lattice constants are found to decrease monotonically with pressure up to 5 gpa while the monoclinic angle ( @xmath9 ) which is increasing with pressure as depicted in figure [ abc - adn ] in the pressure range 0 - 5 gpa .",
    "russell et al@xcite reported the p - t phase diagram of adn using energy dispersive x - ray diffraction and raman spectroscopic measurements under pressure up to 10 gpa and they claimed that @xmath7-adn ( ambient phase of adn ) transforms to @xmath9-adn phase through a first - order polymorphic phase transition around 2 gpa .",
    "however , davidson and co - workers @xcite revisited the high pressure behavior of adn using a combination of x - ray and neutron powder diffraction techniques and found that adn is quite stable up to 4.03 gpa . from the theoretical perspective , without treating intermolecular interactions , sorescu et al@xcite predicted that adn is stable up to 10 gpa and it transforms from monoclinic ( @xmath19 ) to triclinic ( @xmath20 ) symmetry above 10 gpa .",
    "thus there exists an inconsistency between various studies regarding the high pressure behavior of adn . in order to resolve this issue ,",
    "we have extended our pressure range from 5 - 10 gpa in our calculations using dft - d2 method . as illustrated in the inset of figures [ abc - adn]a - e",
    ", we could see a discontinuity in the lattice constants * ` a ' * , * ` c ' * and monoclinic angle @xmath21 whereas lattice constant * ` b ' * exhibits monotonic behavior as a function of pressure up to 10 gpa .",
    "the discontinuities in the structural properties of adn might suggest a structural transition / distortion around 6 gpa .",
    "similar kind of discontinuities were seen in the case of solid nitromethane for the lattice constants and bond parameters using d2 method which discloses the structural phase transition in the pressure range 10 - 12 gpa.@xcite    as illustrated in figure [ abc - adn]e , the volume is decreasing with pressure and a discontinuity is observed in the pressure range 6 - 7 gpa .",
    "moreover , we have also computed the equilibrium bulk modulus ( b@xmath22 ) and its pressure derivative ( b@xmath23 ) by fitting the pressure - volume data ( 0 - 5 gpa ) to 3@xmath24 order birch - murnaghan equation of state.@xcite the obtained b@xmath22 and b@xmath23 values using pbe , various dft - d and vdw - df methods are presented in table [ tab : table1 ] along with the experimental results.@xcite it is found that the obtained b@xmath22 and b@xmath23 values are consistent with the experimental data @xcite and other theoretical calculations.@xcite the calculated b@xmath22 values for adn using dft - d and vdw - df methods are larger than nitromethane ( 8.3 gpa)@xcite , @xmath7-rdx ( 13.9 gpa)@xcite , @xmath9-hmx ( 15.7 gpa)@xcite and petn - i ( 12.3 gpa)@xcite which indicates that adn is harder than the conventional secondary explosives .",
    "apart from this , we have also calculated the normalized lattice constants and the data are presented in figure [ abc - adn]f .",
    "the lattice constants * a * , * b * and * c * shrink with different compressibilities 96.5 , 92.70 and 96.49 @xmath6 , respectively for adn in the studied pressure range of 0 - 5 gpa .",
    "the calculated axial compressibilities are found to be consistent with the x - ray powder diffraction data.@xcite also , the axial compressibilities show that @xmath25-axis is the most compressible over @xmath26- and @xmath27-axes for adn , which is due to weaker intermolecular interactions ( van der waals and/or hydrogen bonding ) along the @xmath25-axis as shown in figure [ adn - h]b .",
    "x - ray diffraction@xcite and spectroscopic@xcite studies reveal that hydrogen bonding plays a vital role in determining the stability of adn . in order to understand the effect of pressure on hydrogen bonding , we have plotted the normalized intermolecular hydrogen bond parameters ( bond lengths and angles ) as a function of pressure as depicted in figure [ bla - h ] .",

    "o3a bonds .",
    "adn lattice is found to be more compressible along crystallographic * b*-direction which is due to large compressibility ( mainly arises from h4 ... o2b ) of helically structured hydrogen bonding network along the * b*-axis ( see figure [ adn - h]b ) .",
    "we also observe sharp discontinuities in the hydrogen bond parameters in the pressure range between 6 - 7 gpa .",
    "the sharp increase in hydrogen bond lengths may lead to a weakening of the hydrogen bonding which can be further analyzed through the calculated hirshfeld surface , 2d finger print maps and ir spectra in secs .",
    "iii b and iii d , respectively .",
    "in addition , we have also calculated the intra - molecular interactions of both cation ( nh@xmath28 ) and anion ( n(no@xmath29 ) as a function of pressure as illustrated in figure [ bla ] .",
    "overall , the intermolecular interactions are significantly affected by pressure over intra - molecular interactions as depicted in figures [ bla - h ] and [ bla ] .",
    "the discontinuities in the bond parameters from both inter- and intra - molecular interactions may suggest a structural phase transition in adn around 6 gpa .",
    "furthermore , pictorial representation and quantification of intermolecular interactions in molecular solids can also be described by 3d hirshfeld surface ( hs ) in combination with 2d finger print maps .",
    "the hs and finger print maps are unique for a molecule in a crystal .",
    "hirshfeld surfaces are produced through the partitioning of space within a crystal where the ratio of promolecule to procrystal electron densities is equal to 0.5 , resulting in continuous non - overlapping surfaces .",
    "the molecular hirshfeld surfaces of adn are generated using standard ( high ) surface resolution with the 3d d@xmath30 surfaces were mapped over a fixed color range of -0.5 ( red ) to 0.5 @xmath14 ( blue ) .",
    "the d@xmath30 surface is used for identification of very close intermolecular interactions .",
    "the d@xmath30 values are mapped onto the hs by using a red - blue - white color scheme : red , blue and white regions represent shorter , longer and the distance of contacts is exactly equals to the vdw radius separation , with positive , negative and zero d@xmath30 values , respectively .",
    "the calculated hs for various intermolecular interactions ( o ... h ,",

    "h / h ... o contacts , which are attributed to n - o .. h / n - h ... o hydrogen bonding interactions appear as two sharp symmetric spikes in the 2d fingerprint maps .",
    "the o ... h / h ... o interactions provide the most significant contribution to the total hirshfeld surface , accounting for 56.8 @xmath6 ( see figure [ fig:2d]b ) of the total hs ( see figure [ fig:2d]a ) . similarly , the rest of intermolecular interactions",

    "o interactions increases to the total hs with progressing pressure ( also see figure 2 of the supplementary material).@xcite in addition , we could also see an abrupt change in the contribution to the hs from various intermolecular interactions in the pressure range of 6 - 7 gpa ( see figure [ fig : hs - p ] ) as inferred from the lattice and bond parameters ( see figures [ abc - adn ] , [ bla - h ] @xmath0 [ bla ] ) of adn .",
    "elasticity is a fundamental property of materials to examine their mechanical response to an applied stress .",
    "quantifying and understanding the elastic properties of energetic materials is important to have a basic knowledge about the intermolecular interactions thereby analyzing stiffness of these materials .",
    "it has been previously reported @xcite that stiffer the lattice less the sensitive it becomes to detonation from a mechanical shock initiation .",
    "several investigations were carried out to measure the elastic stiffness constants for the well known secondary explosives namely rdx,@xcite hmx,@xcite petn,@xcite and cl-20 .",
    "@xcite these studies reveal that overall rdx is the stiffest lattice which indicates the relative insensitiveness of rdx when compared to the above secondary explosives such as hmx , petn and cl-20 . on the similar path , to understand the mechanical response and stiffness of the examined solid energetic oxidizer , we have also calculated the elastic stiffness constants for adn .",
    "it is well known from single crystal x - ray diffraction measurements,@xcite that adn crystallizes in the monoclinic structure at ambient conditions and hence adn possesses thirteen independent elastic constants .",
    "the obtained elastic constants at ambient pressure at d2 equilibrium volume are given in table [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "also , the calculated elastic constants meet the well known born s stability criteria indicating that the investigated compound is mechanically stable at ambient pressure . in addition , the three diagonal elements can be used to correlate with the strength of intermolecular interactions along three crystallographic directions .",
    "based on the measured stiffness constants , haycraft @xcite reported that cl-20 should be most sensitive to detonation along @xmath26-axis and least sensitive along @xmath25-axis .",
    "also , it is observed that c@xmath31 is the stiffest elastic constant for petn which makes petn to be least sensitive along [ 100 ] direction.@xcite similarly , the calculated ordering of diagonal elastic constants for adn as follows : c@xmath31 @xmath32 c@xmath33 @xmath32 c@xmath34 .",
    "c@xmath31 is found to be the stiffest elastic constant for adn , which is due to strong intermolecular interactions along @xmath26-axis .",
    "this implies that adn is less sensitive to detonation along [ 100 ] direction similar to that of petn.@xcite the lower elastic moduli / high compressibilities reveal that adn is found to be more sensitive to detonation along the * b*-crystallographic direction .    furthermore to understand the mechanical stability under hydrostatic pressure",
    ", we have also calculated the elastic constants as a function pressure and these are depicted in figure [ cij]a for the examined compound . as illustrated in figure [ cij]a , 11 out of 13 independent elastic constants are increasing with pressure while the remaining two c@xmath35 and c@xmath36 are softening under compression .",
    "in addition , we also observe discontinuities in the elastic stiffness constants for c@xmath31 and c@xmath33 as a function of pressure which are reflected from the pressure dependent lattice constants and bond parameters .",
    "sinko and smirnov@xcite proposed the theoretical conditions of elasticity under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "liu et al@xcite derived the mechanical stability criteria for monoclinic crystal systems under pressure based on theoretical conditions of sinko and smirnov.@xcite we have also calculated the mechanical stability criteria as a function of pressure for the ambient phase of adn .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ cij]b , the mechanical stability criteria ( m6 = c@xmath35-p ( @xmath37 0 ) ) and ( m9 = ( c@xmath33-p)(c@xmath38-p)- c@xmath39 ( @xmath37 0 ) ) are violated above 6 gpa .",
    "this clearly indicates that ambient phase of adn is found to mechanically unstable above 6 gpa .",
    "therefore , these results indicate a possible structural phase transition in adn around 6 gpa .      in order to explore the dynamical stability ,",
    "we have first calculated the zone center phonon frequencies for the investigated compound .",

    "the calculated high frequency asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of adn in the near ir region are compared with ap at ambient pressure as presented in figure [ ir-0 ] . the stronger the hydrogen bonding is , the more is the displacement towards low frequency ( red - shift ) region that occurs . as illustrated in figure",
    "[ ir-0 ] , the high frequency n - h stretching modes of adn show red - shift in comparison to the n - h stretching frequencies of ap which is consistent with the fourier transform ir experiments.@xcite this clearly indicates that adn has stronger hydrogen bonding than ap due to which adn can bind large amounts of water by forming strong hydrogen bonding networks",
    ". this could be the reason why adn is more hygroscopic than ap.@xcite    further , ir spectra has been calculated up to 10 gpa in steps of 1 gpa .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ ir2]a , the far ir lattice mode frequencies which include both nh@xmath3 and n(no@xmath45 oscillations , no@xmath5 twisting , nh@xmath3 translation , and rotation of nh@xmath3 and n - no@xmath5 fragments of the adn molecules are increasing with pressure below 5 gpa and these vibrational modes show red - shift above 5 gpa .",
    "the ir vibrational modes corresponding to torsional and asymmetric stretching of n - n and no@xmath5 bands exhibit blue - shift with pressure as depicted in figures [ ir2]b @xmath0 c , which implies hardening of the lattice upon compression . based up on blue and/or red - shift of ir frequencies and their corresponding intensities ,",
    "joseph et al@xcite gave a consolidated description for strengthening and/or weakening of hydrogen bonding .",
    "due to the presence of hydrogen bonding , it can be expected that the n - h strengthening frequency decreases ( red - shift ) with increasing pressure and this red - shift leads to a strengthening of hydrogen bonding.@xcite also , our previous studies@xcite and those of pravica et al@xcite on hydrogen bonded systems suggest that red-/blue - shift in the mid ir frequencies stabilize / destabilize the system under hydrostatic compression .",
    "as illustrated in figures [ ir2]d , e@xmath46 f , the n - h bending , symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands show blue - shift as a function of pressure up to 5 gpa which indicates the weakening of hydrogen bonding below 5 gpa .",

    "the features of computed ir spectra under pressure is different below and above 5 gpa ( see figures [ ir2]a , d , e@xmath0 f ) .",

    "adn is found to be stable up to 5 gpa which is in good accord with the recent x - ray and neutron diffraction study.@xcite while the abrupt changes in the structural , mechanical properties and weakening of hydrogen bonding strongly suggest that adn undergoes a structural transformation around 6 gpa .",
    "there is an approximately 1 gpa deviation between structural , mechanical properties ( discontinuities were observed between 6 - 7 gpa ) and ir spectra ( shift in the ir frequencies between 5 - 6 gpa ) which is due to distinct pseudo potentials paw and nc approaches were used in the present study .",
