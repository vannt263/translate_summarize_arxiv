    "in this paper we describe a procedure to engineer the shape and the size of optical antennas from chemically synthesized monocrystalline gold micro - plates without the use of focused ion beam ( fib ) equipment . unlike current trends recently developed for carving monocrystalline nanoantennas  @xcite our top - down methodology only requires simple and widespread electron - beam lithography and dry etching instruments .",
    "in addition , our process is free of re - deposition and surface contamination issues that fib is known to generate  @xcite .",
    "fib milling typically requires long processing times since large areas need to be sequentially removed by the scanning ion beam to form the shape of nanoantennas . on the contrary ,",
    "our methodology is advantageous since the electron beam exposes only the geometry of the nanoantenna .",
    "this makes our method less time - consuming .",
    "we demonstrate our protocol on optically resonant nanorod antennas , but the process can be readily adapted to more complex plasmonic systems .",
    "surface plasmons are defined as the coupling between free electrons of a metal and an electromagnetic wave . with first works originating from early 20th century  @xcite",
    ", plasmonics has now turned into a mature scientific and technological field @xcite .",
    "owing to the extreme sub - wavelength confinement of the light on plasmonic structures , advanced applications are found in the scope of light manipulation  @xcite , frequency conversions  @xcite , biosensing  @xcite , and photovoltaic devices  @xcite .",
    "new branches are also emerging , including nonlinear plasmonics  @xcite , plasmon - induced hot carrier science  @xcite , graphene plasmonics  @xcite and nanoscale plasmonic logic  @xcite , among others .    on a practical standpoint ,",
    "the metal layer constituting the plasmonic devices is mainly deposited as thin film ( c.a .",
    "50 nm ) of gold or silver . for the vast majority of the reported structures , the plasmon - supporting metals are standardly thermally evaporated on the substrate under high vacuum condition .",
    "the films are thus polycrystalline by nature and their quality may vary between fabrication facilities .",
    "as reported recently , the variety of experimental conditions leads to irreproducibility within samples and causes disagreements between results from different research groups  @xcite .",
    "parameters such as vacuum conditions , deposition rate and target purity generate typical surface roughness and grain sizes characterizing the polycrystalline films .",
    "these extrinsic factors hamper fundamental plasmonic properties such as the propagation length of a surface plasmon polariton  @xcite , the quality factor of a nano - resonator  @xcite , or the electron - phonon relaxation rate  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the surface roughness can be mitigated by the use of ultrasmooth layers  @xcite and the developement of specific precursors for atomic layer deposition  @xcite , but the films remain polycrystalline with the presence of grain boundaries .",
    "further , the adhesion promoter ( _ i.e. _ a thin chromium or titanium layer ) conventionally used to improve the resilience of the metal film is often considered negligible although some metal interdiffusion may occur and degrade the optical properties of the plasmonic layer  @xcite .",
    "lastly , it is not always possible to deposit a high - quality metal layer on specific substrates such as ultra - low wettability polymer  @xcite .",
    "these facts stress the weaknesses of standard metal deposition approaches with respect to the reliability of plasmonic structures and its dependence on the available equipment .",
    "opposite to top - down standard approaches , structures obtained by colloidal synthesis are usually single crystals  @xcite .",
    "the synthesis only provides a limited distribution of nanoparticle shapes , but the elements are identical from one batch to another and remain independent of the equipment and personnel .",
    "this was demonstrated by fabricating large - scale ultrathin metal films made by self - assembly of colloidal size - controlled nanoplates  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take full advantage of the colloidal synthesis to produce well - defined single crystal two - dimensional au plates , which serve as a material platform for engineering monocrystalline antennas .",
    "our protocol represents an improvement compared to usual polycrystalline nanoantennas because high - definition monocrystalline nanoantennas have been shown to ( i ) provide superior plasmonic properties  @xcite , and ( ii ) to ensure reproducible investigations using a robust material platform .",
    "to synthesize anisotropic two - dimensional ( 2d ) micron - sized plates two strategies may be conducted .",
    "a first strategy is a seed - mediated route whereby pre - prepared below-5-nm nanoparticles are introduced to a growth solution .",
    "this method may be advantageous for gaining control over the nanoparticles geometry  @xcite . a second method consists in using a seedless approach to obtain anisotropic nanoparticles .",
    "this is a faster synthesis and is performed in a single vessel  @xcite .",
    "we choose to use such a seedless type of synthesis , inspired by the protocol reported by guo _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "all chemicals are analytical pure reagents purchased from alfa aesar gmbh ( germany ) and are used as received .",
    "water is purified through a purelab system . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure1](a ) , the general principle to synthetize 2d micron - sized plates is based on two successive reductions of au(iii ) to au@xmath1 following the reaction : au@xmath2(cl@xmath0)@xmath3 + reducing species @xmath4 au@xmath1 + cl@xmath5 products  @xcite . in brief , the first step is to heat ethylene glycol to 65@xmath6c to form c@xmath7h@xmath3o , the first reducing species .",
    "a small quantity of chloroauric acid ( haucl@xmath3 ) is then rapidly introduced into the solution , which leads to the formation of gold nanospheres  @xcite .",
    "some of these nanospheres present structural defects such as twinned planes , which favor an anisotropic growth  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath8 twinned planes are created in the early stage of crystallization , the three sides perpendicular to the @xmath9 direction become favorable sites for the binding of gold atoms coming from a continued gold reduction  @xcite . within 1 minute following the introduction of haucl@xmath3 in hot ethylene glycol",
    ", aniline is added in a 2:1 molar proportion to chloroauric acid . according to guo _ _ et al.__@xcite , this ratio is the optimal trade - off as more aniline yields smaller plates .",
    "we find that the yield of synthesizing large plates is higher when the aniline solution is introduced at a slow rate , in agreement with the literature  @xcite .",
    "the solution is then left at 65@xmath6c for 3 to 4 hours .",
    "it is a significantly smaller temperature than in the work of guo _ _ et al.__@xcite ( 95@xmath6c ) .",
    "our experience indicates that 65@xmath6c maximizes the ratio of plates over byproducts .",
    "we also find that leaving the reaction for more than 4 hours neither improves the production yield nor increases the size of the plates . at this point ,",
    "gold plates with triangles , hexagons and truncated triangles have sedimented to the bottom of the vessel .",
    "the supernatant of the solution , mainly composed of gold nanospheres , is removed to diminish the percentage of byproducts and increase the plate concentration .",
    "the plates are then re - dispersed in ethanol and potassium chloride ( kcl ) is added until saturation to prevent the plates from aggregating .",
    "a few drops of the solution are then deposited on a thoroughly cleaned glass substrate to begin the nanofabrication process .",
    "after evaporation of the solvent , the 2d gold plates adhere strongly to the surface owing to van der waals forces and may withstand firm rinsing , nitrogen blowing and even sonication .",
    "kcl is then rinsed off in de - ionized water .",
    "figure  [ figure1](b ) is a scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) of 2d single - crystal au plates with various degrees of growth ranging from truncated triangles to hexagons .",

    "the solution is dried on a si substrate for imaging purpose .",
    ", width=377 ]",
    "in order to thoroughly assess the nature of the synthesized 2d plates , we proceed to four characterization steps . first , we perform electron diffraction x - ray ( edx ) measurement to determine the material constituting the plates . no trace of nitrogen element is found , which indicates that there is no chemical residue from the synthesis leftover on the 2d plates .",
    "second , we investigate the morphology and the crystal structure with transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) . figure  [ figure2 ] ( a ) is high resolution tem images of the corner and edges of plate acquired in bright field mode .",
    "the images reveal the atomic structure and demonstrate the high quality of the synthesis .",
    "to access the crystal structure of the plate , we measure a selected - area electron diffraction pattern using a 250 mm camera length .",
    "the large facets are oriented perpendicular to the electron beam . the diffraction pattern , shown in fig .  [ figure2](b )",
    "is well defined and the spots are arranged in hexagonal patterns .",
    "the diffraction figure corresponds to a monocrystalline structure and a face - centered cubic bravais lattice , confirming that we have synthesized single - crystal gold structures .",
    "we image a series of plates from the same batch by high - resolution tem and consistently observed similar results .",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] ( c ) shows a typical fourier transform analysis of a high - resolution tem image .",
    "the electron ",
    "diffraction pattern demonstrates that the upper facet of the plate belongs to the @xmath8 family as expected from the literature  @xcite .",
    "all these characterization steps provide conclusive evidence that the synthesized plates are @xmath9 monocrystalline gold structures .",
    "hence , they can legitimately be used as a base material for improved plasmonics characteristics , _",
    "e.g. _ optimized nanoscale optical resonators  @xcite .",
    "last , we take atomic - force microscope ( afm ) images to assess the height and the roughness of the au plates . figure  [ figure2](d ) displays a typical topographical image .",
    "the synthesized plates have thicknesses ranging from 40 to 90 nm and a roughness of about 1 nm ( for a substrate roughness around the 2d plate of about 1 nm too ) . the afm also enables us to select suitable forms with respect to their thicknesses , lateral dimensions and absence of defects .",
    "in this section , we detail the different fabrication steps followed to create single - crystal nanoantennas from the synthetized plates discussed above .",
    "the steps are sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] and are discussed in details below . in order to identify the selected plates ,",
    "we deposit them on a grid landmark created by standard electron - beam lithography  @xcite . briefly , we spincoat poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) resist on the clean glass substrate ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]i ) .",
    "we expose the resist with a commercial electron - beam lithography system ( raith pioneer ) to write the layout of the alignment grid , and subsequently proceed to its development ( fig .",
    "[ figure3] i ) .",
    "we then thermally evaporate a 25-nm layer of chromium in a high - vacuum deposition chamber ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]ii ) .",
    "cr is selected for its strong adhesion property .",
    "we then carry out a lift - off step to remove the unexposed resist , and obtain a grid of cr labeled cross symbols on the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]iii ) .",
    "we then dropcast the chemically synthetized plates from the growth solution to the grid substrate ( fig .",
    "[ figure3] iii ) .",
    "all selected plates are photographed using a calibrated optical microscope ( objective 100@xmath11 ) .",
    "the micrographs are exploited in a home - built imagej^^ plugin that provides the coordinates of the selected plates with respect to the corner of the alignment crosses .",
    "an example of the procedure is depicted in fig .",

    "[ figure4](a ) displays a plate placed near a cross of the grid landmark .",
    "the home - made program determines the coordinates of the plate with respect to a given origin ( here , the large cross labeled h ) .",
    "the outline of the plate is then reported in the design desk of the commercial electron - beam lithography software where the array of antennas is also designed ( fig .  [ figure4](b ) ) .    in this specific design , we draw an array of optical rod antennas of width equals to 50 nm and lengths varying from 70 to over 500 nm . in the present work ,",
    "the distance between each antenna composing the array is kept intentionally large to mitigate mutual near - field electromagnetic interactions  @xcite and to ease the optical characterization . by considering a developement of the synthesis for forming larger au plates ,",

    "( b ) reporting of the plate s layout on the design desk used to draw the optical antennas ( red features inside the plate ) .",

    "[ figure3]iv ) and conduct an electron - beam lithography of the antenna layout ( fig .  [",

    "the exposed shapes in the pmma resist are then developed and a 25 nm thick layer of ni is thermally deposited on the entire substrate ( fig .",
    "[ figure3]vi ) .",
    "we evaporate nickel because we can selectively remove this metal in the last step of the process .",
    "the resist is lifted - off to obtain a gold plate with rod - like shapes formed by the nickel mask ( fig .",

    "the etching rates are 0.8 nm.s@xmath13 for the gold flake and 0.14 nm.s@xmath13 for the ni mask .",
    "we therefore carry out the etching for a period of time of 120 - 180  s , which is enough to etch through the au plate without a complete removal of the ni thickness . for information",

    "the different steps ( lithography , etching ) required to produce the antennas can not be implemented on ultrathin tem grids .",

    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "once the critical etching parameters are determined , the fabrication routine can be implemented on any plates .",
    "the remaining factor affecting the repeatability is linked to the inherent variability of the electron - beam lithography and resulting size of the antennas .        to characterize the plasmonic resonances we spectrally analyze each nanoantenna individually .",

    "the linewidth is an important parameter indicative of the intrinsic and extrinsic losses occurring in the antenna .    to assess the quality of the etched optical antennas , we conduct a comparison with conventionally fabricated devices realized by standard electron - beam lithography and metal evaporation of a thin cr layer followed by 50 nm of au . by the nature of the evaporation process , these antennas are intrinsically polycrystalline",

    "we excluded from the fitting analysis all the peaks with a tail extended outside the detection window of the detector .",
    "electron scattering at the surface , grain boundaries , bulk effects ( interband and intraband transitions ) as well as radiation damping are the dominant dephasing mechanisms affecting the linewidth of the dipolar surface plasmon resonance  @xcite .",
    "the opened circles in fig .",
    "[ figure7](b ) are data points inferred from the spectra displayed fig .",
    "[ figure7](a ) and the graph is complemented by extinction measurement of antennas produced from another plate . to ease the comparison with the literature",
    ", we plot the graph in energy instead of wavelength .",
    "the linewidths of the dipolar peaks are situated around 250 mev , which corresponds to about 80 nm in units of wavelength .",
    "we also include in the graph spectroscopic measurements obtained from the polycrystalline antennas as well as selected data extracted from the literature for a series of nanoantennas resonating in the considered spectral range ( diamonds ) .",
    "the opened diamonds are data from grand _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who lithographed 70 nm wide au polycrystalline nanorods with varied aspect ratios .",
    "this set of data is complemented by our own data measured on polycrystalline 90 nm wide antennas shown in filled diamonds . while the two sets of data can not be compared because the different widths of the objects are affecting their respective plasmon linewidth  @xcite , the trends are qualitatively similar and reinforces the discussion .",
    "nanoantennas fabricated by electron - beam lithography and metal evaporation have a significantly broader resonance due to the intrinsic polycrystallinity of the evaporated metal .",
    "the solid curve is the localized plasmon linewidth calculated using tabulated values of the au s complex permittivity for polycrystalline evaporated films  @xcite . for antenna resonances located in the higher energy region , the linewidth increases because of the onset of interband transitions in the material  @xcite .",
    "the dashed line in the graph is the resonance linewidth computed by canceling the absorption ( fixing the imaginary part of the permittivity to zero ) .",
    "this assumption gives an estimate of the linewidth achievable for ideal intrinsic lossless antennas .",
    "the curve indicates that the radiation loss decreases with higher energy  @xcite .",
    "this is easily understood because radiation damping scales with the volume and the resonances found at high energy are typical for smaller objects .",
    "note that the two computed linewidths are affected by the precise antenna geometry ( here taken as a rectangular section with sharp corners ) .    in the low energy region ,",
    "the difference between the dashed curve computed for ideal lossless antennas and the trend calculated by taking into accounts the tabulated permittivity is the bulk contribution to the linewidth .",
    "here the difference is about 60 mev , in , reasonable agreement with the literature  @xcite .",
    "the experimental linewidths pertaining to the single - crystal antennas are somewhat located between these two curves .",
    "two qualitative conclusions may be drawn .",
    "first , despite a certain variability in the data points , they are for the most part located below the predicted linewidth .",
    "we note that johnson and christy tabulated au s permittivity using polycrystalline films . the imaginary part of the dielectric function is thus enclosing bound electron contributions but also electron scattering at grain boundaries inherent to the film structure .",
    "scattering at imperfections is necessarily reduced in crystalline objects and may explain why our data are somewhat below the theoretical trend .",
    "we could have tentatively tried to estimate this effect by adjusting the imaginary part of the permittivity to the experimental data points , but the spread of the data and the sensitivity of the theoretical curve to the precise antenna geometry hinder a conclusive quantification .",
    "the added value of our fabrication technique is best seen in the energy region where intrinsic dephasing mechanisms are influencing the resonance . for polycrystalline antennas ( diamonds ) , scattering at grain boundaries and",
    "surface roughness contributes at enlarging the resonance as demonstrated by the consistent increased of the linewidth with energy for both set of amorphous objects .",
    "the response of monocrystal antennas ( open circles ) clearly show a resonance s linewidth systematically narrower than polycrystalline antennas resonating in the same spectral range and is almost constant throughout the detection window .",
    "this is was also observed with crystalline nanorods produced by colloidal chemistry  @xcite .",
    "the optical antennas produced by etching a single - crystal plate have thus reduced roughness - induced damping compared to antennas prepared by lithography , while offering a design flexibility that chemically synthesized nanoparticles typically lack .",
    "we have presented an alternative way of fabricating nanoantennas formed by etching two - dimensional crystalline au plates .",
    "our method does not require having access to a fib instrument .",
    "we start out by synthesizing micron - size gold plates , which serve as base material for preparing nanoantennas .",
    "we create a mask of the nanoantenna shapes by electron - beam lithography and etch away the areas of the plate that are uncovered by the mask . the fabrication of crystalline antennas are finalized by subsequently removing the mask .",
    "we assess by dark field spectroscopy the quality of the fabricated elements . by comparing the resonance quality of our antennas with polycrystalline antennas and computed trends",
    ", we demonstrate superior characteristics with a reduced resonance linewidth .",
    "our work facilitates applications necessitating nanostructures with enhanced characteristics and design flexibility .",
    "we demonstrate our approach on simple antenna design but the procedure can be applied to more complex plasmonic objects such as optical gap antennas .",
    "provided that the physical mask is conformed to the antenna layout , gaps routinely obtained by electron - beam lithography should be achievable .",
