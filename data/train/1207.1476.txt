    "<S> thermophotovoltaic devices are energy - conversion systems generating an electric current from the thermal photons radiated by a hot body . in far field , </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of these systems is limited by the thermodynamic schockley - queisser limit corresponding to the case where the source is a black body . on the other hand , in near field </S>",
    "<S> , the heat flux which can be transferred to a photovoltaic cell can be several orders of magnitude larger because of the contribution of evanescent photons . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true when the source supports surface polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , in the infrared where these systems operate , the mismatch between the surface - mode frequency and the semiconductor gap reduces drastically the potential of this technology . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that graphene - based hybrid photovoltaic cells can significantly enhance the generated power paving the way to a promising technology for an intensive production of electricity from waste heat .    </S>",
    "<S> a hot body at temperature @xmath0 radiates an electromagnetic field in its surroundings because of local thermal fluctuations . in the close vicinity of its surface , at distances smaller than the thermal wavelength @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic energy density is several orders of magnitude larger than in far field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the near - field thermal radiation associated to non - propagating photons which remain confined on the surface is a potentially important source of energy . by approaching a pv cell @xcite in proximity of a thermal emitter </S>",
    "<S> , this energy can be extracted by photon tunneling toward the cell . </S>",
    "<S> such devices , also called near - field thermophotovoltaic ( ntpv ) systems , have been proposed ten years ago @xcite . in presence of resonant surface modes such as surface polaritons , </S>",
    "<S> the flux exchanged in near - field between source and photodiode drastically overcomes the propagative contribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery has opened new possibilities for the development of innovative technologies for nanoscale thermal management , heating - assisted data storage @xcite , ir sensing and spectroscopy @xcite and has paved the way to a new generation of ntpv energy - conversion devices @xcite .    despite its evident interest , several problems still limit the technological development of ntpv conversion . </S>",
    "<S> the main one is the mismatch between the frequency of surface polaritons supported by the hot source and the gap frequency of the cell ( typically a semiconductor ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , all photons with energy larger than the frequency gap are not totally converted into hole - electron pair but a part of their energy is dissipated via phonon excitation . besides , low - energy photons do not contribute to the production of electricity but are only dissipated into heat within the atomic lattice . to overcome this problem , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce here a _ relay _ between the source and the cell to make the transport of heat more efficient . </S>",
    "<S> graphene is a natural candidate to carry out this function . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this two - dimensional monolayer of carbon atoms which has proved to be an extremely surprising material with unusual electrical and optical properties @xcite can be tailored by modifying the chemical potential to be resonant between the gap frequency of the semiconductor and the resonance frequency of the polariton supported by the source . in the context of heat transfer , </S>",
    "<S> the role of graphene has been recently investigated @xcite , confirming its tunability and paving the way to promising thermal devices such as thermal transistors . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , a ntpv cell in which a suspended graphene sheet acts as source has been recently considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we propose here a modification of the standard ntpv scheme , in which the surface of the cell is covered with a graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , this enables to exploit at the same time the existence of a surface phonon - polariton of the source and the tunability of graphene as an efficient tool to enhance the source - cell coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figgeometry ] outlines our novel hybrid graphene - semiconductor ntpv system . a hot source made of hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) at temperature @xmath2k , eventually heated by an external primary source , </S>",
    "<S> is placed in the proximity of a graphene - covered cell made of indium antimonide ( insb ) at temperature @xmath3k , having gap frequency @xmath4 . in the frequency domain of interest , </S>",
    "<S> the insb dielectric permittivity can be described using the simple model @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the refractive index and the choice @xmath7 reasonably reproduces the experimental values of absorption @xcite . as discussed before , it is important to choose a source having a strong emission , and possibly a surface phonon - polariton resonance , at frequencies slightly larger than the gap frequency @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> for our purpose we have chosen hbn which we describe ( ignoring for the sake of simplicity its anisotropy ) using a drude - lorentz model @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model predicts the existence of a surface phonon - polariton resonance at frequency @xmath14 , larger than @xmath8 as wished .    </S>",
    "<S> the hybrid configuration will be compared to the case without graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the optical properties of graphene are accounted for by means of a 2d frequency - dependent conductivity ( see appendix for details ) @xcite as already done in the context of a heat - transfer calculations in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are going to study the modifications to the radiation flux between the source and the cell , as well as to the power produced by the device , due to the presence of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our main scope is to investigate whether the presence of graphene is able to enhance the efficiency of the ntpv cell and possibly the output power as well .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we need a general expression for the heat flux exchanged between two planar surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> this distance - dependent flux @xmath15 can be expressed in near - field regime as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 this expression implies the sum over all the evanescent modes of the electromagnetic field ( identified by the frequency @xmath18 , the transverse wavevector @xmath19 and the polarization @xmath20 taking the values @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) of the product of the energy @xmath23 carried by each mode @xmath24 , the difference @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the distribution function inside the reservoir of modes at temperature @xmath0 , and a transmission probability @xmath27 through the separation gap assuming values between 0 and 1 . in this landauer - like decomposition </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the transmission probability @xmath27 represents an absolute measure of the contribution of a given mode to the energy exchange . in the case of two semi - infinite parallel planar media </S>",
    "<S> this quantity reads @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath30 component of the wavevector in vacuum , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the ordinary vacuum - medium fresnel coefficients corresponding to polarization @xmath20 and bodies 1 and 2 respectively . for a ntpv cell </S>",
    "<S> , the expression has to be modified in order to take into account the fact that the cell is a direct - gap semiconductor . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the radiative power exchanged between the source and the cell is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 being the potential difference at which the cell is operating , quantity for which we take a value slightly below the theoretical limit @xmath36 @xcite . as for the expression of the electric power which </S>",
    "<S> is generated from this flux , it reads @xmath37    as anticipated , the evolution of both @xmath38 and the cell efficiency @xmath39 has to be followed when modifying a ntpv device , the challenge being their simultaneous enhancement . in figure [ figetappv ] </S>",
    "<S> we represent both the efficiency and the ratio of electric powers for four different configurations , namely without graphene and with a sheet deposed on the surface of the cell for three different values of the chemical potential @xmath40 . regarding the efficiency </S>",
    "<S> , we see that graphene produces indeed an enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath41 nm @xmath42 goes from around 10% in absence of graphene to almost 20% for @xmath43ev , approaching considerably the ideal carnot limit @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that for larger distances and for any choice of @xmath40 the graphene - modified efficiencies tend to the one associated to the standard hbn - insb system . as for the electrical power </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of graphene produces an amplification going up to values of the order of 8 , showing that both desired conditions are met by our modification scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> we now show in figure [ figfwk ] the transmission probability @xmath27 for a source - cell distance of @xmath41 nm , without and with graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we first observe that in absence of graphene the modes contributing to the effect are concentrated in proximity of the surface resonance @xmath45 of hbn . </S>",
    "<S> this resonance branch decays with respect to the wavevector @xmath46 , and in particular is no longer visible around @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this cutoff , well - known in the theory of radiative heat transfer , is mainly connected to the distance between the bodies and is roughly given by @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the insb cell does not support any surface mode in the frequency region of interest . </S>",
    "<S> this is no longer true in presence of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of the optical properties due to the deposed sheet induces the appearance of a resonant surface mode associated to the graphene - modified cell , represented in figure by the dot - dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> this is not visible for @xmath49ev , appears for very high wavevectors for @xmath50ev , is clearly visible for the largest chosen value @xmath43ev . </S>",
    "<S> the new physical mechanism generated by the presence of graphene can be described in terms of a coupling between the two surface modes . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath43ev this manifestly produces an enhanced region of transmission probability around the intersection point of the two branches , while for @xmath51 and 0.3ev the same coupling , taking place at larger values of @xmath52 , gives rise to an increase of the cutoff wavevector @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath53 is a decreasing function of @xmath54 and that the graphene - induced resonant modes exist for high values of the wavevector explains why the efficiency enhancement decreases with @xmath54 .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss the effect of graphene on the flux spectrum @xmath55 ( [ figspectrum ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first manifest effect is the amplification , for any value of the chemical potential , of the peak of the spectrum at @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly corresponds to the enhancement of the cutoff wavevector @xmath53 ( i.e. an increased number of participating modes ) observed for any considered value of @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the coupling discussed for @xmath43ev is here reproduced in terms of enlargement of the peak . </S>",
    "<S> these curves clearly explain that both the radiation exchange and the electric power are amplified . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , they also allow to explain the enhancement of efficiency . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , the modifications to the spectral properties are more pronounced around @xmath45 , which is larger than @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , since the region @xmath57 contributes only to @xmath58 , this amplification results in a higher value of @xmath42 as well .    </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a novel setup for ntpv energy conversion in which the pv cell is covered with a graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of this two - dimensional system modifies the optical response of the cell , causing in particular the appearance of new surface resonant modes which coupling to the ones belonging to the source produce a significant enhancement of the electric power produced in the cell as well as of the overall efficiency of the ntpv cell . </S>",
    "<S> these graphene - based photovoltaic cells have a considerable potential to enable ultrahigh - efficiency electricity production from thermal energy . </S>"
