    "the last twenty years have shown radio sources to be extremely good probes of cosmological large - scale structure up to significant ( @xmath14 ) redshifts .",
    "clustering in radio catalogues was detected in early wide - area studies : seldner & peebles ( 1981 ) and shaver & pierre ( 1989 ) reported the detection of slight clustering of nearby radio sources , while kooiman , burns & klypin ( 1995 ) and loan , wall & lahav ( 1997 ) measured strong anisotropy in the distribution of bright radio objects from the 4.85  ghz green bank and parkes - mit - nrao surveys .",
    "however , it was only few years ago that the latest generation of radio surveys such as first ( faint images of the radio sky at 20 cm ; becker , white & helfand 1995 ) , wenss ( rengelink et al . 1998 ) and nvss ( nrao vla sky survey ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) included enough objects to allow for high - precision clustering measurements ( cress et al .",
    "1996 ; rengelink et al . 1998 ; magliocchetti et al .",
    "1998 ; blake & wall 2003 ; overzier et al .",
    "all these recent analyses reveal the tendency for radio objects to be more strongly clustered than optically - selected galaxies .",
    "assessing the real clustering signal is nevertheless not an easy task when it comes to radio sources , since the lack of known redshifts for the overwhelming majority of these objects forces one to deal with projected quantities such as the angular two - point correlation function @xmath15 ; unfortunately , the relation between angular and spatial measurements is dependent on the radio source redshift distribution @xmath16  which is highly uncertain at the mjy flux levels probed by these new surveys ( see e.g. dunlop & peacock 1990 ; magliocchetti et al . 1999 )  and on the unknown redshift evolution of the radio clustering signal .",
    "this leads to estimates for the comoving correlation length @xmath17 ( here we are assuming the spatial two - point correlation function to be described by the power - law @xmath18 ) which may span the relatively broad range @xmath19  mpc even for angular measurements in good agreement with each other ( magliocchetti et al .",
    "1998 ; blake & wall 2003 ; overzier et al .",
    "2003 ) .    since the natural solution to",
    "the above problem ( redshift acquisition for all the objects included in a chosen catalogue ) is out of reach with current instruments , a good starting point towards the understanding of the clustering properties of radio sources is the analysis of homogeneous subsamples of objects , bright enough in the visible band to allow for optical and spectroscopic follow - ups .",
    "a first attempt in this direction was performed by peacock & nicholson ( 1991 ) who measured the redshift - space correlation function for a sample of 310 radio galaxies with @xmath20 and radio fluxes @xmath21  jy at 1.4  ghz .",
    "these authors indeed found radio sources in their catalogue to be strongly clustered , with a redshift - space correlation length @xmath22  mpc .",
    "the present paper analyses the clustering properties of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath0  mjy radio galaxies drawn from the joint use of the first and 2df galaxy redshift surveys as illustrated in magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . by doing this",
    ", we not only extend the peacock & nicholson ( 1991 ) measurements to a statistically more significant sample involving less local objects , but we also probe much lower flux densities where the population contains radio - emitting sources that differ from typical agns ( such as galaxies undergoing intense star formation ) .",
    "in addition to the above analysis , we will also estimate the two - point correlation function ( both in redshift space and real space ) for the homogeneous sample of radio agns ( sources that present signatures of agn activity in their optical spectra ) .",
    "this will enable us to use up - to - date models , which connect galaxy formation properties with clustering behaviour in order to investigate the nature of the dark matter halos in which these sources reside .",
    "by means of the same approach we can also obtain precious information on the nature of the black hole associated with a radio - active agn to be compared with conclusions from other works .",
    "for instance , auriemma et al . ( 1977 ) found that radio emission is more common in brighter / more massive ellipticals .",
    "this result was recently confirmed e.g. by findings of falomo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , while authors such as laor ( 2000 ) , lacy et al .",

    "( 2003 ) have investigated the connection between black hole mass and radio luminosity , coming to conclusions in disagreement with each other .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces 271 new spectroscopic counterparts for local , @xmath25  mjy , radio sources , derived from the joint use of the first and 2df galaxy redshift ( 2dfgrs ) surveys .",
    "section 3.1 describes some of the properties of the total first-2dfgrs sample , which puts together objects presented in section 2 with those introduced in magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , while sections 3.2 and 3.3 are respectively devoted to the analysis of the redshift - space correlation function @xmath2 and of the projected correlation function @xmath26 both for the whole radio-2dfgrs sample and only for the 536 radio - agns .",
    "section 4 compares the available data with models in order to derive the minimum dark matter mass of a halo able to host an agn - fuelled radio source and gives some constraints on the minimum black hole mass of a radio - loud agn .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes our conclusions .    unless stated otherwise , throughout this work we will assume @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath8 and @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 the rms density fluctuation within a sphere with a radius of @xmath31 mpc ) , as the latest results from the joint analysis of cmb and 2dfgrs data seem to indicate ( see e.g. lahav et al . , 2002 ; spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "to avoid confusion , we especially emphasise that distances will thus normally be quoted in mpc , assuming @xmath8 .",
    "units of @xmath32  mpc will occur only rarely .",
    "this assumption is also made in all figures quoted for radio luminosities and black - hole masses .",
    "all the correlation lengths are in comoving units .",
    "the 2dfgrs ( colless et al . 2001 , 2003 ) is a large - scale survey selected in the photometric @xmath33 band from the apm catalogue ( maddox et al .",
    "1990a , 1990b , 1996 ) and its subsequent extensions ( maddox et al .",

    "the final version includes 221,414 unique , reliable ( i.e. with quality flags @xmath34 , colless et al . 2001 , 2003 ) galaxy redshifts to an extinction - corrected limit for completeness of @xmath35 ( with small variations in magnitude limit as a function of position over the sky ) over an area of 2151 square degrees .",
    "the survey geometry consists of two broad declination strips , a larger one in the sgp covering the area @xmath36 , @xmath37 and a smaller one set in the ngp with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , plus 100 random 2-degree fields spread uniformly over the 7000 square degrees of the apm catalogue in the southern galactic hemisphere .",
    "the median redshift of the galaxies is 0.11 and the great majority have @xmath40 .",
    "the completion of the 2dfgrs has allowed us to obtain 271 new spectroscopic counterparts for @xmath0  mjy radio objects to be added to the sample presented in magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . as in magliocchetti",
    "( 2002 ) , the parent radio dataset comes from matching together sources in the first ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) and apm catalogues over the region of the sky between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where these two surveys overlap .",
    "magliocchetti & maddox ( 2002 ) find 4075 identifications  corresponding to 16.7 per cent of the original radio sample  in the apm catalogue for @xmath43 and for a matching radius of 2 arcsec , value chosen as the best compromise to maximize the number of real associations ( expected to be @xmath44 of the first - apm dataset ) , while limiting the number of random coincidences to a negligible @xmath45 per cent .",
    "971 objects ( hereafter indicated as the photometric catalogue ) in the parent dataset exhibit @xmath33 magnitudes brighter than 19.45 , the limit of the 2dfgrs .",
    "we note that , even though the fine angular resolution of the first survey implies that some of the flux coming from extended sources could be either resolved out or split into two or more components , leading to a systematic underestimate of the real flux densities of such sources , this effect has been partially corrected for by using the method developed by magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to combine multi - component objects .",
    "the above technique , together with the matching procedure , associates optical counterparts to the centroids of multi - component sources , thus minimizing the chances of missing an object with extended radio emission .",
    "also , as already discussed in magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the correction to radio fluxes as measured by first is @xmath46 in the case of sources brighter than 3  mjy , and about 30 per cent for sources with @xmath47 3  mjy ( which mainly correspond to compact spiral galaxies and starbursts ) .",
    "these corrections have been shown not to affect any of the results obtained in both the previous ( magliocchetti et al .",

    "distinctions between different classes of sources and in particular between e+agn , seyfert 2 and late - type galaxies have relied on the diagnostic emission line ratios of veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) , woltjer ( 1990 ) and rola terlevich & terlevich ( 1997 ) . note that a definite classification was not possible for all the cases .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that it is in general quite common to find ` composite ' galaxies containing both an agn and ongoing star formation ( see e.g. hill et al",
    "we also found two intermediate cases of seyfert 2-spectral - types with mildly broadened emission lines .",

    "the combination of the sample introduced in magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and of those sources presented in section 2 provides us with a total of 828 first radio objects with a spectroscopic counterpart in the 2dfgrs .",

    "this can be understood because the first-2dfgrs catalogue probes radio fluxes down to @xmath104  mjy , which results in a mixture of `` classical '' agn - fuelled sources , generally hosted by elliptical galaxies , and star - forming objects such as spirals and irregulars ( see section 2 ) .",
    "this mix of early and late type galaxies makes the dataset look similar to a fair ( even though very sparse ) sample of the whole population of 2dfgrs galaxies .",

    "we will discuss the implications of these findings in section 3.3 when dealing with the real - space correlation function .    as a final step , we are interested in investigating whether there is any dependence of the clustering signal on radio luminosity .",

    "the precise form of @xmath139 can be analytically derived following the approach of peacock and dodds ( 1996 ) . the effective bias @xmath140 , which determines the way radio sources trace the mass distribution , is obtained via : @xmath141/ \\nonumber\\\\ \\left[\\int_{{\\rm m_{\\rm min}}}^\\infty n(m , z)\\;dm\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively are the linear bias factor and the halo mass function of individual halos of mass @xmath144 at a redshift @xmath87 and  in our specific case  @xmath145 is the minimum mass of a halo able to host a radio - agn .    in order to compare models with data",
    "we have then written both @xmath142 and @xmath143 according to the sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) prescriptions and derived the theoretical projected @xmath118 by integrating the spatial correlation function ( [ eq : xith ] ) along the direction parallel to the line of sight @xmath117 via equation ( [ eq : xibar ] ) , where all the relevant quantities are evaluated at the median redshift of the 2dfgrs , @xmath146 .",
    "the dotted lines in fig .",

    "the chosen values for the minimum mass range from @xmath147  m@xmath148 ( bottom dotted curve ) to 10@xmath149  m@xmath148 ( top dotted curve ) . despite the large error bars ,",
    "it is clear that none of the predicted @xmath118 s for minimum halo masses @xmath150   m@xmath148 can provide a reasonable fit to the data , since they all fall below the observed values .",
    "indeed , the best fit is obtained for @xmath151=13.7^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ ] , corresponding to an effective bias @xmath152 .",
    "we note that very similar values ( i.e. @xmath151=13.5^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ ] and @xmath151=13.0^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$ ] ) are also found if one releases the assumption of one radio galaxy per halo and considers more general distributions of the kind @xmath153 ( see e.g. peacock 2003 ) or a more extreme @xmath154 ( with @xmath155 average number of radio galaxies per halo of mass @xmath144 ) even though , as expected , the difference between models derived for different values of @xmath156 decreases as one increases the weight given to larger - mass haloes ( see fig . [",
    "fig : xi_th ] ) .",
    "the implications of the above results are quite intriguing since they suggest , independent of the chosen halo occupation form , that radio - agns reside in relatively massive haloes , spanning a mass range from rich groups to super - massive clusters .",
    "smaller halos seem to be inhibited from hosting a radio - emitting agn .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the small - scale behaviour of the redshift - space correlation function of radio - agns as measured in section 3.2 . indeed , both the lack of pairs with distance @xmath157  mpc and the flattening of @xmath2 on scales @xmath158  mpc have a natural explanation if one assumes agn - powered sources to be confined in massive halos ( even if one can not exclude this latter finding as due to the fingers of god effect , see hawkins et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the case where only one source per halo is assumed",
    ", the halo - halo spatial exclusion ensures that no pair of radio - agns can be found with a separation smaller than the sum of the virial radii of the halos that host them . for a typical halo mass of @xmath159m@xmath148",
    "the minimum separation for the adopted cosmology turns out to be @xmath160  1.6 mpc . allowing for the uncertainties in our determination of @xmath145 ,",
    "this implies that there should be a deficit of pairs on scales @xmath161  mpc , consistent with the observed flattening of @xmath2 on small scales .",
    "thus our average estimate of the minimum halo mass for a radio - agn is @xmath162\\simeq 13.4 $ ] ) , which is about a factor 10 larger than that associated with `` normal '' early - type galaxies , @xmath163\\simeq 12.5 $ ] , ( magliocchetti & porciani 2003 ) .",
    "this is also about a factor 10 larger than that obtained for the population of radio - quiet quasars in the 2df qso dataset , @xmath163\\simeq 12.1 - 12.6 $ ] ( grazian et al .",
    "all three of the above determinations are based on samples drawn from the same parent catalogue ( apm survey ) , and so selection effects are not expected to bias the comparison between the different results .",
    "+ taking these numbers at face value suggests that radio - agns and radio - quiet quasars are two distinct populations , with more massive dark matter halos required for an agn to trigger radio activity .    on the other hand , the results presented in section 3.2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : xi_type ] ) together with those obtained by peacock & nicholson ( 1991 ) for more luminous radio galaxies show that radio - agns with very different radio luminosities have very similar correlation amplitude .",
    "if one thinks in terms of the model expressed in equation ( [ eq : xith ] ) , there appears to be little or no correlation between radio luminosity and minimum halo mass .",
    "a simple comparison of figs 6 and 8 illustrates that the correlation function estimates obtained for low - luminosity and moderately bright - luminosity radio - agns both fall in the same @xmath164 range as found for the whole sample ) .    if we then combine the above information , the data seem to suggest that _ there is a threshold halo mass required to produce significant radio emission from an agn but  once the radio activity is triggered ",
    "there seems to be no connection between radio luminosity of the sources and dark matter content of those halos hosting them_. note that this statement does not necessarily imply the minimum halo mass to be the only factor playing a relevant role in the onset of radio emission from an agn .",
    "also the threshold may not be a sharp mass threshold , but could be as a smooth transition between the radio - quiet and radio - loud regimes for halos near @xmath165 .",
    "these results on the minimum halo mass can also be viewed in terms of a minimum black hole mass .",
    "ferrarese ( 2002 ) gives a simple prescription to convert the dark matter mass @xmath166 of a halo hosting a black hole into black hole mass @xmath167 : @xmath168 thus , a minimum halo mass @xmath169 corresponds to @xmath170 , which would represent the minimum black hole mass required to onset radio - agn activity  at least for relatively faint / fri sources such as the overwhelming majority of those we have considered in our analysis ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this estimate is in good agreement with both the results of marchesini , ferrarese & celotti ( 2003 ) and also those of dunlop et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , despite the entirely different methods used in our analysis .",
    "also our minimum black hole mass is noticeably larger than that obtained for radio - quiet quasars ; from an analysis of the 2df qso dataset in the same redshift range spanned by the sources considered in this work , corbett et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find @xmath171\\simlt 8.3 $ ] . by making use of equation ( [ eq : mbh ] )",
    ", we can then conclude that  at least for moderately faint / fri radio sources ",
    "_ there seems to be a minimum black hole mass of about @xmath172 required to produce significant radio emission from an agn ; however , once the radio emission is produced , there is little or no correlation between radio luminosity and black hole mass_. this is in agreement with other analyses of radio - loud quasars by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and cirasuolo et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we note that , even though the connection between black hole mass and radio power has been obtained in our analysis as a consequence of the connection between radio power and halo mass , this first relationship is supposed to be more fundamental and physically based as it is the black hole which actually powers the agn .",
    "any correlation between radio power and halo mass is then expected to arise as a secondary effect , since black hole mass is observed to scale with bulge luminosity and this is turn is related  in the case of elliptical galaxies  to halo mass ( see e.g. magorrian et al .",

    "these objects can be divided in two broad sub - classes : ( 1 ) star - forming objects ( 66 sources , which include both late - type and star - burst galaxies ) , which owe their radio activity to processes connected to intense star formation and ( 2 ) radio - agns ( 202 sources ) , where the radio signal stems from accretion processes onto a central black hole . in both cases , the redshift range range spanned extends up to @xmath174 ( with star - forming objects being relatively more local than agn - fuelled sources ) and radio luminosities cover the interval @xmath175 , which identifies the radio - agns included in the sample as fri sources .",
