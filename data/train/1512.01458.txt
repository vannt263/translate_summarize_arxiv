    "this paper provides a new optical observation of 17p / holmes during the 2014 perihelion passage using a wide - field camera recently available at the kiso observatory , when it was located at the position of the 2007 outburst .",
    "an unprecedented cometary outburst occurred at 17p / holmes on ut 2007 october 23 , brightening by about one million times within a day @xcite . soon after , the comet was enclosed by an envelope composed of high - speed dust grains .",
    "the envelope faded out in about a year because of solar radiation pressure as well as its high ejection velocity , leaving behind a near - nuclear dust cloud .",
    "afterward , the comet remained active for years , showing a minor outburst @xcite and lingering dust ejection at 45 au @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the faint dust tail in the infrared suggested that it could contain trailing dust particles ejected during the 2007 outburst @xcite .",
    "big particles from comets are widely observed through telescopic observations and remote - sensing observations with spacecrafts ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these large particles can stay close to the orbits of parent bodies for many revolutions around the sun and form ` dust trails ' , which are occasionally discriminated from dust tails consisted of fresh dust particles ejected during current returns .",
    "neck - line is a sub - structure rarely detected in dusts tails ( and in dust trails , in principle ) , which is caused by a dynamical effect .",
    "theoretically , dust particles ejected at a point ( first node ) converge on the orbital plane of the parent body at the opposite end viewed from the sun ( the second node , i.e. the differential true anomaly between the dust ejection point and observed location is 180 ) .",
    "the accumulation of the dust particles enhances the surface brightness of the dust cloud , as first proposed by @xcite ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "an analogous phenomenon essentially occurs when dust particles complete one orbital revolution ( i.e. the third node ) .",
    "taking advantage of the neck - line effect , we aimed to detect the debris cloud ejected the 2007 outburst .",
    "we described the observation and data reduction in section 2 , diagnosed the observed image in section 3 on the basis of photometric and dynamical properties .",
    "as the result , we could obtain indubitable evidence for the debris cloud associated with the 2007 outburst .",
    "we derived the velocity , mass and total kinetic energy of the outburst grains using our new observation data to deepen our understanding of the historical event .",
    "we imaged 17p / holmes in the @xmath14 band for four nights on ut 2014 september 18 , 2223 , and 25 with the kiso wide field camera ( kwfc ) attached to the 105 cm schmidt telescope operated by the kiso observatory , the university of tokyo .",
    "the kwfc is a mosaic ccd camera consisting of eight ccd chips with a total of 8k @xmath3 8k pixels @xcite .",
    "the combined system provides a 2.2@xmath3 2.2  field of view ( fov ) with a moderate pixel resolution ( 0.946/pixel ) .",
    "we used the lower half of the kwfc for our observation to reduce the readout time ( from 144 to 68 s ) , so the instrument covered 2.2@xmath3 1.1  on the sky plane in a single snapshot with four ccd chips ( see figure [ fig : f1 ] ) . because the telescope can be operated only in a sidereal tracking mode , we could not take longer exposures .",
    "we set the individual exposure time to 180 s , during which time the comet moved by 1.5 , which is larger than the pixel scale but still less than the half of the typical seeing disk size at the observatory ( i.e. , a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 3.35.3 , * ? ? ?",
    "we took images of 17p / holmes on ut 2014 september 18 and 2223 in the range between @xmath150.2   eastward and @xmath152  westward from the nucleus position .",
    "in addition , we contrived to take images on ut 2014 september 25 with a wide coverage , within 6  westward from the nucleus , scanning along the projected orbit of the comet .",
    "only the images on ut 2014 september 22 are available for study because the sky background was too high to detect the faint structure on ut 2014 september 18 owing to moonlight , the weather conditions were bad because of a typhoon ( known as tropical storm fung - wong ) on ut september 23 , and the total exposure time was insufficient to subtract the background objects on ut 2014",
    "september 25 . for these reasons , we focused on analysis of images taken on ut 2014 september 22 . on that night , we took 60 snapshot images ( i.e. , a total exposure time of 3 h ) at ut 15:1119:35 , when the comet was at a heliocentric distance @xmath7 of 2.464 au , an observer s distance @xmath16 of 2.094 au , and a phase angle ( sun  comet  observer angle ) @xmath17 of 23.7 .",
    "the true anomaly was @xmath18 = 63.1 , slightly larger than that of the 2007 outburst , @xmath18 = 61.1 . in this configuration ,",
    "the convergent point exists at 2.7   westward from the nucleus .",
    "the observed data were preprocessed using bias and dome flat images .",
    "figure [ fig : f1 ] shows an example snapshot image after bias and flat field correction .",
    "there are @xmath151  gaps between each ccd chip .",
    "because we employed the dithering operation mode for the telescope , the gaps are mostly ( but not perfectly ) eliminated by multiple exposures . in the snapshot ,",
    "the comet and dust cloud are unclear because they were located in the star - crowded area near the galactic plane ( galactic latitude @xmath19 ) .",
    "accordingly , we paid close attention to elimination of background components .",
    "we thus subtracted the background stars and diffuse interstellar cirri using images taken on the next night ( ut 2014 september 23 ) when the comet had moved northeastward by 15 .",
    "moreover , we masked the position of stars brighter than r@xmath20 22 in the images after star and cirrus subtraction to eliminate the remnants caused by misalignment of the stellar positions .",
    "we then combined 60 masked images according to the motion of the comet nucleus , excluding the masked regions .",
    "the defective pixels and ccd gaps are also excluded by the image combination process .",
    "flux calibration was conducted using field stars archived in the ucac3 catalog , ensuring a photometric accuracy of @xmath150.1 mag or less @xcite .",
    "geometrical correction was performed by comparison with the astrometric data in the usno b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "the positional error of the usno b1.0 catalog , @xmath150.4 , is good enough that we can discuss the position angle and morphology of the dust structure in this study .",
    "[ sec : observations ]",
    "figure [ fig : f2 ] shows a composite image taken on ut 2014 september 22 after background objects and instrumental artifacts were subtracted .",
    "the figure shows not only a cometary tail near the nuclear position ( a whitish cloud in the lower left corner ) but also a long structure extending from the lower left ( southeast ) to the upper right ( northwest ) .",
    "it spreads to both sides beyond the fov of the kwfc ( @xmath12.2 ) .",
    "we hereafter analyze these cloud morphologies as shown below .",
    "figure [ fig : f3 ] shows a close - up of the contours of the near - nuclear dust tail .",
    "it extended between the negative heliocentric velocity vector ( at a position angle , p.a.=275.4 ) and the antisolar direction ( p.a .",
    "= 260.1 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , we show sets of synchrones ( loci of positions of particles having a wide range of sizes released at given times , @xmath21 ) and syndynes ( loci of positions of particles of a given size , @xmath22 , having a wide range of ejection epochs ) . although these lines are not separated well , we roughly estimated the dust ejection epoch and particle size .",
    "we determined the locus of the maximum brightness of the dust tail using least square fitting with a gaussian function in every 1  bin and found that the dust tail extended to p.a .",
    "= 270@xmath00.5 , which corresponds to the synchrone of @xmath23 days before the observation .",
    "because the comet was observed 179 days after the perihelion passage , it is likely that the near - nuclear dust tail consisted of particles ejected during the perihelion passage in 2015 . from comparison with the syndynes",
    ", we estimate an effective particle radius of 10 -1 mm for the near - nuclear tail .",
    "we visually set the sunward extent of the dust coma to @xmath1540 , which corresponds to the distance projected on the sky plane , @xmath24 = 6 @xmath3 10@xmath25 m , at the position of the comet .",
    "considering @xmath24 as the turnaround distance of dust particles ejected toward the solar direction while being pushed by solar radiation pressure , we placed a limitation on the ejection velocity , @xmath26 = 340@xmath27 m s@xmath6 , where @xmath28 denotes the ratio of the solar radiation pressure with respect to the solar gravity @xcite . in the possible size range ( 10 -1 mm , or @xmath28 = 5.7 @xmath3 10@xmath295.7 @xmath3 10@xmath30 )",
    ", we estimated an ejection velocity @xmath26 of 8 m s@xmath6 for 1 mm particles and 80 m s@xmath6 for 10  particles .",
    "although we understand that these are very crude estimates , the derived velocity is typical of dust emission from jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) at @xmath31 2.5 au @xcite .",
    "thus , 17p / holmes changed from its peculiar appearance just after the 2007 outburst to an appearance typical of jfcs in only one orbital revolution .",
    "we measured @xmath32 values with differential aperture size from 5,000 km ( 3.3 , equivalent to 1@xmath3fwhm ) to 50,000 km at intervals of 5,000 km , and obtained almost constant values of @xmath32=139141 cm within 10,000 km but found significant drops due to the radiation pressure .",
    "the @xmath32 value is typical of general comets listed in @xcite ( @xmath810@xmath510@xmath33 cm around 2.5 au ) .",
    "the prominent feature is the long narrow structure .",
    "there could be four possibilities to create such long extended structure : ( 1 ) dust tail ( i.e. dust particles ejected during the current return ) , ( 2 ) ion tail , ( 3 ) dust trail , and ( 4 ) neck - line .",
    "we measured a position angle of 274.6@xmath0 0.1 , which deviates significantly from that of the antisolar direction ( p.a .",
    "= 260.1 ) but is very close to that of the negative heliocentric velocity vector ( p.a .",
    "= 275.4 ) .",
    "it also coincides with the direction of the synchrone of the 2007 outburst epoch ( i.e. , @xmath21 = @xmath342526 days in figure [ fig : f3 ] ) , although the time resolution of the synchrone analysis is not sufficiently accurate to specify the exact ejection epoch .",
    "this fact indicates that the long narrow structure is not associated with neither ( 1 ) dust tail nor ( 2 ) ion tail , but with either ( 3 ) dust trail or ( 4 ) neck - line ( i.e. a swarm of dust particles ejected during the last perihelion passage or even before ) .",
    "it is interesting to think why the comet has this spectacular long extended structure , although the near - nuclear dust tail looks typical of jfcs , as we mentioned above ( section [ subsubsection : tail ] ) .",
    "we examined the surface brightness and width .",
    "figure [ fig : cut ] shows the surface cut profiles perpendicular to the long extended structure , where we averaged the brightness along the extended direction ( p.a .",
    "= 274.6 ) in the bin length of 6 .",
    "the structure was unclear at the distance @xmath35@xmath36  because the bright near - nuclear dust tail overlapped the faint extended structure .",
    "we fitted the background sky brightness by third - order polynomials and obtained the peak brightness and fwhm .",
    "figure [ fig : fwhm ] shows the result .",
    "the fwhm clearly increased as the peak brightness decreased from west to east .",
    "the peak brightness is in the range of 26.227.0 mag / arcsec@xmath5 , which is equivalent to those of some bright cometary dust trails such as 67p / churyumov  gerasimenko @xcite and 22p / kopff @xcite .",
    "it is , however , important to notice that the shape and brightness distributions differ from general dust trails . as shown in some papers ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dust trails show narrowing toward the nuclei .",
    "in addition , the fading toward the nucleus is inconsistent with the dust trail structure of 17p / holmes detected by spitzer observation , where the brightness increased toward the nucleus @xcite .",
    "thus , the long extended structure in our 17p / holmes image could be unlike the typical dust trail structures seen to date .      to determine the surface brightness profile of the long extended structure",
    ", we summed up the signal from the extended structure .",
    "we set a rectangular aperture box of 2@xmath3 2.2 . after subtracting the sky background , which was determined at 13  from the trail center on both the north and south sides",
    ", we obtained the total @xmath14 magnitude of @xmath37 = 12.3 @xmath0 0.2 in the kwfc fov .",
    "the observed @xmath14 magnitude was converted to the absolute magnitude ( i.e. , corrected to unit heliocentric and geocentric distances at zero phase angle ) using    @xmath38    where the term @xmath39 characterizes the scattering phase function of dust grains . using a commonly used formula , @xmath39 = 0.035@xmath17 , and substituting @xmath7 = 2.464 au , @xmath16 = 2.094 au , and @xmath17 = 23.7",
    ", we obtained @xmath40 = @xmath41 4.4 = 7.9 @xmath0 0.2 .",
    "the absolute magnitude is converted into the cross section by the following equation @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 = @xmath44 is the @xmath14 magnitude of the sun @xcite , and @xmath45 is the geometric albedo in the @xmath14 band .",
    "assuming @xmath45 = 0.04 , which is often used for cometary grains , we obtained @xmath2 = ( 2.3 @xmath0 0.5 ) @xmath3 @xmath46 m@xmath5 .",
    "the grain mass can be derived as @xmath47 , where @xmath22 and @xmath48 are the grain radius and mass density , respectively . from the synchrone analysis ( see figure 3 ) , the long extended structure extended upper right ( along the negative velocity vector , @xmath49 ) , which is consistent with dust particles of @xmath501 mm but inconsistent with @xmath51100 . assuming @xmath48 = 10@xmath33 kg m@xmath52",

    "it is important to note that the derived mass is the lower limit because the dust particles extended beyond the fov .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the @xmath53 value to identify the origin of the long extended structure .",
    "the dust production rate of 17p / holmes was @xmath153 kg s@xmath6 around its perihelion before the 2007 outburst @xcite .",
    "supposing that a comet loses most of its mass at a constant rate within 2.5 au , which corresponds to a duration of about a year , 17p / holmes was expected to lose about 10@xmath54 kg in total during the last perihelion passage , except for the outburst .",
    "the mass is significantly ( more than two orders of magnitude ) smaller than the mass of the long extended structure in the kwfc fov .",
    "in contrast , the total mass of the outburst ejecta was derived as 10@xmath410@xmath55 kg @xcite .",
    "the mass of the long extended structure is equivalent to or smaller than the total ejecta mass of the 2007 outburst .",
    "together with the position angle and morphology we mentioned above , we conclude that the long extended structure is a part of the dust cloud ejected during the 2007 outburst but is tentatively detected by our observation because of the convergence effect ( i.e. , the neck - line effect ) . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we further investigate the physical properties of the long extended structure , regarding it as a remnant dust ejecta during the 2007 outburst .",
    "we conducted a model simulation of dust particles ejected during the 2007 outburst to derive the size and ejection velocity of the 2007 outburst ejecta .",
    "the basic theory is essentially the same as that described in @xcite . in the model ,",
    "the motion of dust particles is governed by the ejection velocity ( @xmath26 ) and the solar radiation pressure ( parameterized by @xmath28 , the ratio of the radiation pressure acceleration to solar gravity , which is the same as @xmath28 in section [ subsubsection : tail ] ) . for spherical compact particles with a mass density of @xmath48 ( kg m@xmath52 ) and a radius of @xmath22 ( m ) ,",
    "it is written as @xmath28 = 5.7 @xmath3 10@xmath30 @xmath56@xmath6@xmath22@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the modeled images were generated by the monte carlo approach assuming the velocity and size distribution .",
    "positions of dust particles at the observed epoch were calculated semi - analytically by solving the kepler s equations rigorously .      as a first step",
    ", we considered a simple impulsive dust ejection model in which the dust cloud consists of dust particles with a uniform size and ejection velocity .",
    "assuming @xmath48 = 10@xmath33 kg m@xmath52 and isotropic dust ejection ( i.e. , particles are ejected equally in all directions ) , we simulated @xmath22 = 100  particles and @xmath22 = 1 cm particles in a possible velocity range of @xmath26 = 5500 m s@xmath6 .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath26 is comparable to the highest dust velocity in the outburst envelope ( i.e. , 554 m s@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the lower limit is close to the escape velocity ( @xmath57 m s@xmath6 ) from the nucleus with @xmath58=2080 m @xcite and a bulk density of 1000 kg m@xmath52 .",

    "these models qualitatively reproduce the observed narrowing and brightening from east to west .",
    "a visual comparison yielded an order - of - magnitude estimate of the ejection velocity of @xmath59 50 m s@xmath6 for 1 cm particles . for 100  particles with low @xmath6050 m s@xmath6",
    ", the dust cloud was blown off westward beyond the fov , because such small dust particles are susceptible to solar radiation pressure and are strongly accelerated toward the negative velocity vector ( i.e. , western direction ) ( figure [ fig : f7 ] ( a)(b ) ) . the increase in ejection velocity",
    "would enlarge the dust cloud in every direction , having the cloud appear in the fov of the kwfc .",
    "however , we noticed that 100  is too small to be detected in the kwfc fov .",
    "if we increase @xmath26 to be observable in the fov , it should have a width much wider than what we observed ( e.g. , figure [ fig : f7 ] ( c ) ) . to summarize the uniform size model",
    ", we applied constraints of @xmath50 100  and @xmath59 50 m s@xmath6 .",
    "second , we employed a more realistic model having a power - law size distribution and velocity distribution for the neck - line structure .",
    "we assumed the number of dust particles was    @xmath61    in the size range @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath22 @xmath63 @xmath64 , where @xmath62 and @xmath64 are the minimum and maximum particle sizes detectable in the kwfc fov , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath65 is the reference size of dust particles ( we set @xmath65 = 1 cm and @xmath62 = 100 following the result of the uniform size model above ) .",
    "we use the following function for the ejection terminal velocity of dust particles :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is a random variable having an average of 1 and a standard deviation @xmath68 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we set @xmath68 = 0.1 , which was the value obtained from a similar outburst at p/2010 v1 .",
    "note that @xmath67 makes a minor contribution to the spatial distribution of dust particles when @xmath69 .",
    "now we have five variables ( @xmath70 , @xmath64 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ) . among them , @xmath70 can be determined by scaling the simulation intensity to the observed one once the other four parameters are fixed .",
    "we thus created a number of simulation images to find the best - fit parameter set assuming @xmath74 cm , 10 cm , and 1 m in @xmath75 at the interval of @xmath76 , @xmath77 m s@xmath6 at the interval of @xmath78 m s@xmath6 , and @xmath79 at the interval of @xmath80 , respectively .",

    "the width of the neck - line structure increases as @xmath72 increases .",
    "further , @xmath71 is also sensitive to the width .",
    "the width increases when @xmath71 is small , because small particles with higher velocity are efficient scatterers for smaller @xmath71 . we compared the width and intensity distribution with respect to the distance from the nucleus with those of the model simulation .",
    "we found the leftmost data point does not match any model probably because the data was contaminated by an unconsidered error source ( such as the remnant of background stars or imperfect flat - fielding ) , and thus ignored it .",
    "we obtained the best - fit parameters via @xmath81 test , @xmath71 = @xmath343.4 @xmath0 0.1 , @xmath72 = 50 @xmath0 10 m s@xmath6 , and @xmath73 = 0.3 @xmath0 0.1 .",
    "we appended the errors of these parameters when simulation results matched the observed results to an accuracy of the measurement .",
    "in the parameter range above , @xmath64 is less determined ( although we got the constraint of @xmath82 cm ) , because such large particles are supposed to stay near the comet nucleus while such signature from biggest particles was obscured by the bright dust tail and coma .",

    "considering the size distribution with an index of @xmath71 = @xmath343.4 @xmath0 0.1 in the size range @xmath22 = 1001 cm , which were obtained by the dynamical model in section [ sec : model ] , we obtained a mass of @xmath104=(3.67.2 ) @xmath3 10@xmath11 kg for the neck - line particles ( i.e. big remnant particles ) .",
    "if we integrate down to submicron particles ( i.e. , @xmath62 = 0.6 , * ? ?",
    "* ) , we derive a total mass of @xmath10=(3.87.7 ) @xmath3 10@xmath11 kg for the 2007 outburst ejecta , which is almost the same as @xmath104 because largest grains make up most of the mass .",
    "the mass also shows good consistency with several previous studies such as a radio continuum observation by @xcite and is consistent with the upper limit in @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy of large dust particles ( @xmath22 = 1001 cm ) is estimated to be @xmath105=(714)@xmath310@xmath101 j. similarly , if we integrate down to 0.6 -sized particles , we got @xmath12=(16)@xmath310@xmath13 j. the energy per unit mass is less than 20% of the energy released during the crystallization of amorphous water ice .",
    "as already described in @xcite , our results may imply that the outburst can be caused by the crystallization of buried amorphous ice .",
    "it is interesting to notice that a large amount of big dust particles was injected into the interplanetary space by a single outburst event and survived for @xmath17 years without melting or disintegrating the structure and observed as the neck  like structure .",
    "the cometary dust particles will probably disperse in the interplanetary field via planetary perturbations and constitute a portion of zodiacal cloud @xcite .",
    "there is a long - standing question about the origin of zodiacal dust cloud because it erodes by poynting - robertson effect and mutual collision among particles .",
    "we estimated the contribution of cometary dust particles via 17p - like outbursts .",
    "it is not clear how often such big cometary outbursts occurred .",
    "we assumed the frequency of 0.11 per century because the comet exhibited similar ( but slightly weaker ) outburst in the 19th century @xcite . multiplying the frequency by @xmath10",
    ", we obtained a crude estimate of 12240 kg sec@xmath6 .",
    "although there should be a large uncertainty in the rate , ejecta by 17p - like outburst would account for a considerable fraction ( 124% ) of the required mass to sustain the zodiacal cloud ( i.e. 10@xmath106 kg sec@xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we speculate that some fraction of zodiacal dust might be generated by 17p - like outbursts and remain in the interplanetary space for a long time to be observable as zodiacal light .",

    "we found that :    1 .",
    "17p / holmes consisted of two components : a near - nuclear fresh dust tail and a long extended structure .",

    "the typical size of the particles is 1 mm1 cm on the basis of a comparison with a dynamical model .",
    "the ejection speed is around 50 m s@xmath6 or even more , which is faster than the values of submicron grains extrapolated using a simple @xmath341/2 law .",
    "we conjecture that the high velocity would result from the sudden sublimation of the icy component .",
    "the total mass and kinetic energy of the 2007 outburst ejecta were ( 48)@xmath310@xmath11 kg and and ( 16)@xmath310@xmath13 j. these are consistent with but more accurate than previous studies .",
