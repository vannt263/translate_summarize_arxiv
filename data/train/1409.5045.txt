    "imagine a world where treatments are computed and where knowledge of medicine is merged in a large database .",
    "new treatments are computed based on mathematical models built by researchers and each new model , like a piece of a puzzle , can be connected within a vast system of knowledge .",
    "potential new treatments would be tested within a computational model and effects would be observed virtually , making animal experimentation obsolete due to lack of accuracy .",
    "new processes explaining functions of the body would be computationally deduced and hypothesized .",
    "ultimately , treatments with minimal sides effects would be tailored to each patient based on their personal biological data .",
    "it is difficult to keep up - to - date with new important research and publications and impossible to cover all the new daily literature in one s domain of study .",
    "we are at a point where even a group of experts with the best communication tools and habits can not efficiently integrate all the new knowledge of their field .",
    "in contrast , we now have the technological means to gather and analyse large amount of data .    a key component needed for the realization of this future",
    "is a common language for science and medicine . in this paper",
    ", we present a unified mathematical language which can be used to represent biological processes and scientific concepts .",
    "although the examples are geared towards medicine , we will also present how this language can be used in different domains with the aim of demonstrating that effort in developing such a language can lead to improved communication and exchange of ideas between fields of studies .    translating each research paper into a set of mathematical expressions and integrating it into a large database",
    "would ensure the findings of each new research study would be integrated into the existing body of knowledge .",
    "a feature of this language is that it could encompass the results of a vast number of papers , so that computations , discoveries and analysis could also be done on the field of medicine as a whole field .",
    "this could be a step into a new domain which could be called meta - medicine .",
    "this could be an opportunity to bridge the gap between publishing results and the integration of the results by the community .",
    "competing theories and contradicting results could be tested against each other through computation and help to improve the general model .",
    "interestingly , experimental results which are usually considered inconclusive or ` negative ' could also contribute to enrich the global database .",
    "the objective behind these investigations is to build a language in which all scientific concepts and notations can be represented , while keeping the way each discipline functions and by enhancing the computational nature of each discipline .",
    "along with the ability to represent all scientific concepts and its computational power , we would also need a language that allows navigation between different levels of complexity or scales ( from dna replication to body mechanics ) , can be used in a large database , has a visual notation and compact notation and has a relative ease of use regardless of the domain of study . with this language ,",
    "dynamic models in biology , chemistry , neuroscience , computer science and physics have been built .",
    "we hope that sufficient steps have been taken towards demonstrating that the language has the qualities mentioned above and that this will inspire others to explore it further .    in mathematics ,",
    "set theory combined with mathematical logic is known to be able to represent most mathematical expressions and concepts , but in practice we rarely directly use set theoretical expressions to represent or solve mathematical problems .",
    "similarly , in computer science , although all programs can be reduced to turing machines of zeros and ones , we rarely think or interact with high - level programming languages in this way .",
    "whatever the language , there seems to be a gap between what we do in the discipline and the fundamental language .",
    "we could say that english along with all mathematical symbols is a complete language which can communicate any scientific concept , but unfortunately , computations can not be done efficiently on words and sentences .",
    "the mathematical languages known as rewriting systems @xcite are very powerful and have been shown to represent grammar , plants and fractals @xcite .",
    "however , the scope of these systems is sometimes restricted to certain types of objects and focuses on automatic theorem proving , normal forms ( expressions that can not be transformed further ) and termination .    the language which will be presented",
    "can be viewed as a higher order rewriting language that has no restrictions on the type of objects and on the objects that can be named .",
    "alternatively , the language could be viewed as a higher order universal turing machine where the symbols , states and tape can be any type of object .",
    "furthermore , we could say that the head of the turing machine could affect its own states and the symbols on the tape could also affect the states and properties of the head .",
    "example of types of objects are models of atoms , molecules , dna strands , cells , neurons , concepts , mathematical equations , programs , 3d geometrical structures , people and also infinite collections of different types of objects",
    ".    the driving question underlying this study can be written as :    what are the atoms of scientific concepts and how can we combine them to represent complex systems ?",
    "in this section , we introduce the elementary elements of the language .",
    "this is only meant to offer a quick glance at the language and one should read further in the subsequent sections for a more accessible and progressive description of the language along with key applications to biology , medicine and other scientific domains .    everywhere",
    "we look in the world , we see change .",
    "we observe changes at every level , whether it be atoms , humans or the stars ; they are changing all the time . as observers",
    ", we can take note of these changes and record them .",
    "based on these records , we can infer and extrapolate the past and the future . in studying these records ,",
    "we recognize interesting structures and name them .",
    "the principles behind the unified mathematical language that will presented can be reduced to the following two statements :    1 .   observe a change in the world .",
    "record what it was and what it became .",
    "2 .   all objects and changes can be named .",
    "for example , let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be objects .",
    "we will denote the transformation of object @xmath0 into @xmath1 by the notation @xmath2 this notation should be understood as @xmath1 having the potential to slide down over the triangle @xmath3 in the direction of @xmath0 so that @xmath1 will take the place of @xmath0 . in itself , this object that we call a _ transformation _ is interesting , but it only represents a potential .",
    "for the change to occur , we first need the object @xmath0 to be present .",
    "this will be denoted by @xmath4 the right arrow means that we apply the transformation @xmath5 to the object @xmath0 in the ordered set @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , changing @xmath0 into @xmath1 will result in @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , @xmath0 is changed into @xmath1 by applying the transformation @xmath5 .",
    "this notation should be visualized as though the transformation will slide down the arrow @xmath8 until the @xmath0 on the right - hand side of the transformation superposes over the @xmath0 inside the parentheses . when the @xmath0 s are matched , the @xmath1 slides down over the directed triangle to finally replace @xmath0 .",
    "mathematically , the application of a transformation can be written this way by using the double arrow as follows .",
    "@xmath9 this reads as the system which is composed of the transformation @xmath5 applied to the object @xmath6 which _ reduces _ to the object @xmath7 .",
    "when we hear the name of friend , we can access a lot of knowledge concerning our friend .",
    "the short string of letters of the name points to an array of knowledge and permits us to avoid the lengthy description of all that is known about the friend .",
    "naming objects is also very important in mathematics and science .",
    "scientific terms permit us to quickly build new theories and explain insightful understanding about the world .",
    "the calculative power of mathematics can be said to rely on its ability to condense long expressions and operations into a string of symbols where the operations are viewed as names that indicate how the symbols should be acted upon . in our language",
    ", we will name objects and transformations by using the symbol ` @xmath10 ' . for example",
    ", we can give the name _",
    "t _ to our transformation @xmath5 by writing @xmath11    for this language to be powerful ,",
    "a key is to allow @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be anything we want .",
    "for example , we can take @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be numbers , models of dna strands , neurons , people , behaviours , 3 dimensional geometric objects or even groups containing different types of objects .    based on this approach ,",
    "this means that the action of folding a model of a protein @xmath12 into the structure @xmath13 is written as @xmath14 and representing a person closing his hand can also be written in the same language as @xmath15 .",
    "a physical therapist will usually be interested in body movements while the biologist will be concerned about objects of the size of proteins , but now both can use this language without losing their respective level of interest .",
    "thus , everything can be brought back to this language and facilitate comparisons and knowledge transfer between disciplines .",
    "this way of viewing things can seem overly simplistic when we think of all the numerous systems and concepts in science it needs to represent , but this is similar to explaining all the physical objects we observe with only the concept of atoms .",
    "we will see that the combinations of transformations leads to highly complex systems such as the functioning of the body . as mentioned , transformations can act on any type of object , but they can also be applied in sequence or in parallel to groups of objects .",
    "moreover , transformations can be applied to groups of transformations so that we can describe and study higher order languages . also , it is possible to have transformations which apply to themselves , thus opening a wealth of possibilities .",
    "importantly , the language comes with computational power because a programming statement can be viewed as a collection of transformations of different types of objects .",
    "moreover , we will see that scientific questions can be written as systems of equations such that the solutions to these equations are the answers . this way , each domain can rely on computing tools to deepen their respective explorations . in medicine , this means that with some effort in translating , creating models and computing , we can build a large dynamic model of the body where all different levels are represented .",
    "we can also insert variables into our models and create equations that represent important questions in medicine .",
    "solutions to these equations would represent treatments or unknown biological processes , thus allowing us to concentrate our resources on solving certain equations to unlock new types of treatments or understanding .    using transformations , which can be seen as the atoms of scientific concepts",
    ", we will be able to represent many systems .",
    "for example , dna replication can be seen as composed of transformations aimed at separating the strands and transformations replacing nucleotides by pairs of nucleotides .",
    "turing machines can be viewed as a collection of transformations which change series of zeros and ones on a tape .",
    "a mass falling to the ground can be represented by a transformation which replaces the mass at a certain height by the same mass slightly closer to the ground .",
    "we will present more refined versions of these examples in the following text and also give models for messenger rna , proteins , a simplified heart , neurons , cell division , chemical reactions , programming statements , mathematical functions and cellular automata .",
    "another important outcome of this language is that discoveries in one scientific domain can lead to similar observations in another domain as the domains share similar mathematical structures .",
    "this points to what could be called _",
    "metascience_. having a seamless language for computer science , mathematics and biology would permit us to transform abstract mathematical concepts into the field of biology , and conversely , study abstract biological processes as mathematical structures",
    ". we could say that a large part of modern mathematics stems from the plane geometric figures studied by the ancient greeks , fractions and numbers . in light of this , one might wonder which kind of mathematical structures will be studied in the future .",
    "in the following section we will describe the language , present important types of transformations , define the equations of this language and discuss some properties of the language .",
    "when we visualize molecules ; we usually imagine them as a drawing or a three dimensional structure .",
    "one of the most efficient ways to learn is by seeing someone do it , the next best thing for many people is to see a drawing or an illustration for which there is a textual description .",
    "the inline notation where all is written as text is valuable if we want a compact form of a concept , but can be more difficult to understand .",
    "for example , molecules are more accurately represented in three dimensions , but they have a two dimension representation and an inline notation .",
    "if we do not want to lose information while reducing the number of dimensions , we have to add new symbols and notations making the representation less easily understood .",
    "for example , a d - glucose chain can be represented inline as @xmath16 while the 2d skeletal notation and the 3d representation give more information as seen below .",
    "note that , while not easy to read , it is possible to encode inline the 3d representation of a molecule .",
    "usually , a mathematical language is restricted to certain types of symbols such as numbers , letters or operators . to have an all - encompassing language",
    ", we have to extend our notion of what a symbol is . for us",
    ", we will allow the symbols to be graphs , diagrams , geometrical shapes and even 3d objects ( represented in 2d or not ) .",
    "this allows us to have a language which has a two dimensional notation , an inline notation and a three dimensional version .",
    "diagrammatics notation is already being successfully used in physics , mathematics and biology . in physics ,",
    "feynmann diagrams @xcite have proven to be a powerful tool and penrose s tensor diagrammatic notation is proposing a new way to do tensor calculus @xcite . in mathematics ,",
    "diagrams are at the heart of graph theory and knot theory . as a notation ,",
    "the language of commutative diagrams of category theory is now an essential tool in investigating highly abstract mathematical structures @xcite and different diagrammatic notations have been used to further study category theory @xcite . in biology , textbooks use many types of diagrams to help the reader to understand . while these diagrams are not standardized , it could be fruitful to have a standard notation to enhance access to knowledge . with all the new capabilities of text editing and access 3d software , we are in a position to transition out of line - by - line mathematical notation and explore diagrams and 3d notations .    in this paper , to help understand , we will often use the two dimensional visual language and make extensive use of colors to simplify the notation .",
    "colors can be always be replaced by numbered subscript or superscript , but its use helps to make the notation lighter .",
    "the visual notation is good for communication and understanding , but the inline notation is very important since it is the basis of computation . it will quickly become clear that the inline version of a structure can be cumbersome , since even colors need to be replaced by a subscript or superscript notation .",
    "we will introduce the visual notation in parallel with the basic inline notation . in the construction of mathematical models",
    ", we will not restrict ourselves to a particular one , but will switch between them in a way which is beneficial for understanding .        in our language ,",
    "any collection of symbols will be called a _",
    "form_. there are no restrictions on what a form can be",
    ". they can be letters , numbers , mathematical symbols , graphs , planar figures , 3d geometric shapes , people and collections of objects .",
    "we will only have to be careful when handling the special characters ` @xmath3 ' and ` @xmath17 ' .",
    "this language could be seen as a calculus of forms where forms can be anything we decide to name or distinguish .",
    "as time passes , things or the forms we see are always changing .",
    "a seed becomes a sprout and the sprout becomes a tree . in our attempt to understand the world ,",
    "we make observations such as `` this type of seed will give a certain type of tree with many different characteristics such as the shape of the leaves and cellular structure '' . in the case of the seed - tree observations ,",
    "we usually think of the seed as being the cause of the tree and not the other way around .",
    "as presented above , we will denote this are @xmath18 and call such a structure a _",
    "transformation_. transformations are forms having potential to change other forms .",
    "the transformation @xmath18 can be understood as representing the process where a seed is replaced by a tree , a seed transforming into a tree or a seed becoming a tree .",
    "the right - hand side of the symbol @xmath3 will be called the _ cause _ of the transformation and the left - hand side will be called the _ effect _ of the transformation .",
    "it should be visualized as the potential for the word @xmath19 to slide down the directed triangle and replace the word @xmath20 .    to observe the process of the becoming of a tree from a seed ; there needs to be a seed present .",
    "this can be represented as @xmath21 and will be called a _",
    "system_. the seed at the right end of the arrow and between the parentheses ` @xmath22 ' indicates the presence of the seed .",
    "this ordered set that is acted on by some transformations will be called the _ initial _ form of the of these transformations . in the present case",
    ", we say that @xmath23 is the initial form of the transformation @xmath18 .",
    "the structure @xmath18 can be seen as the potential of transformation of a seed into a tree and will only transform a seed in a tree when a seed is present .",
    "eventually , we will have many elements in the initial form and unless said otherwise , we will consider that order in which the element appears as important .",
    "for example , @xmath24 is not considered to be the same as @xmath25 .",
    "we can represent the system @xmath21 in a diagram form as follows .",

    "it is important to note that the transformation is applied only once and then disappears after the reduction .",
    "when multiple transformations are used in a system , a reduction can refer to the final form where all transformations have been applied or all the steps leading to that final form are complete .",
    "seeds come in many types , so we can extend our language further and apply the transformation such as @xmath32 to multiple seeds .",
    "there are two interesting ways to do this .",
    "the first is by successively applying certain transformations to an ordered set containing multiple seeds .",
    "the second is by applying one transformation at a time without any definite order .",
    "the first is said to be applied in _",
    "series _ and the second in _",
    "parallel_.    the number of transformations which can be applied on an initial form can be finite or infinite . in the theory of term rewriting systems , a main focus is to have systems which terminate after a finite number of reductions .",
    "for us , since we are mainly concerned about creating mathematical models , we are interested in all the steps of the reductions and this whether it terminates or not . an interesting question for us to ask is if a system has a period or a cycle . in biology ,",
    "an example of periodic system is the cell cycle .",
    "a series of three transformation applied to an ordered set of three seeds is written as    @xmath33    the reduction sequence of this system is be done in three steps and is denoted as follows .",
    "the transformation closest to the initial form is applied first followed by the second closest and so on .",
    "@xmath34    since all the elements of the initial form are the same , the transformation @xmath32 can replace any choice of seed . if one wants to differentiate between the seeds , we could rename them as in the following example .",
    "@xmath35    we now introduce superscript to the transformations .",
    "if we have a series of the same transformation being applied on an initial form , we will write this in a more compact notation by writing as a superscript an integer followed by the letter ` @xmath13 ' which indicates that the transformation is applied in series .",
    "for example , @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 another example with two different types of transformation is to write @xmath38 to represent 10 successive applications of the transformation @xmath32 followed by a series of 7 applications of @xmath39 .",
    "it is important to note that when no superscript is written , it is assumed to mean a superscript of @xmath40 .",
    "for example , @xmath41 is equivalent to @xmath18 .",
    "we can also use the infinity symbol ` @xmath42 ' to denote that the transformation is continuously applied when needed .",
    "thus the system @xmath43 reduces to @xmath44    if we want to replace all that can be replaced , we use the sharp symbol ` @xmath45 ' to denote that the transformation is applied until it reaches a step where it can not replace another element of the initial form , then the transformation disappears .",
    "in other words , it replaces all it can and then disappears .",
    "for example , the system    @xmath46 reduces to @xmath47      when transformations are applied in parallel , we will denote this by grouping them in box brackets ` @xmath48 $ ] ' .",

    "we now have a lot of flexibility with our notation and can modify almost all symbols in a transformation .",
    "the goal behind such a flexible notation is to be able to bridge the gaps between different domains of science by making sure that all can be represented with the use of transformations and useful naming process .    until now",
    ", the variables which were abstracted were written under parentheses like is usually done with functions , but we do not need to follow this way of naming .",
    "we can abstract forms which are similar to the operation of addition and multiplication , respectively @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "integers can be represented by an amount of black dots .",

    "their are many advantages in using a 3d representation .",
    "one advantage is that instead of using subscript and superscript , we can use different shapes to represent different types of transformations . in some cases",
    ", we could quickly identify the transformation to be applied .",
    "examples of this , from an inline notation to a 2d notation is the penrose tensor diagram notation and feynman diagrams . for example , a transformation which rotates an object by @xmath175 radians and doubles the height of an object could be named as follows .",
    "[ figure ]    a transformation which rotates an object by @xmath175 radians , but triples the height of an object could be named as follows .",
    "[ figure ]    naming a transformation with a 3d shape can be interesting if we also define a way to combine the names of similar transformations together in a geometrical way . for example , applying the tripling transformation to the geometrical shape representing the doubling transformation , we will find the following transformation .",
    "[ figure ]    this transformation is interpreted as scaling the figure by a factor of @xmath176 and rotating by @xmath177 radians .",
    "applied on a geometrical shape such as a tetrahedron , this is equivalent to first applying the doubling transformation and then applying the tripling transformation .",
    "another advantage is that we can now have a mathematical notation to study and modify geometrical objects . in mathematics ,",
    "this is related to the field of topology .",
    "we will now give an example where an empty sphere with identified poles is reduced to a torus through a sequence of transformations .",
    "we can apply the transformation    [ figure2 ]    on the empty sphere with identified blue poles given by    [ figure3 ] .",
    "this gives the geometric object    [ figure4 ]    note that since the connections need to be kept , the surface of the sphere must follow the circle in the middle of the sphere .",
    "then , by applying the transformation    [ figure5 ] ,    which dissolves the blue circle , we get the following torus .    [ figure6 ] .    a three dimensional notation could be the new way to present scientific and mathematical ideas .",
    "it is possible that scientific papers of the future wo nt take the form of a written paper , but will be presented in a 3d virtual environment .",
    "the preparations and computations involved in such papers might be better accomplished in an interactive dynamic 3d virtual environment .      until now we have used a combination of two dimensional notations and inline notations ( which is a notation which can be written was a line of text ) .",
    "the advantage of this is that it is sometimes faster to write and can be the basis of a computing language .",
    "the disadvantage is that it is difficult to refer to geometric properties such as angles and shapes .    eventually , all 2d or 3d diagrams should be able to be encoded inline ; although the inline notation might be hard to read ; that language is closer to classical mathematics and programming .",
    "the best would be to become fluent in diagram and inline notation in a way which would allow the use of the strengths of each notation .",
    "we now introduce the symbol `` @xmath178 '' which when placed immediately before similar symbols will indicate that we are referring to the same symbol .",
    "for example ,",
    "in the set @xmath179 we have three occurrences of the symbol @xmath117 , but in the set @xmath180 there are exactly two occurrences of the symbol @xmath117 .",
    "this is a useful notation to write geometric shapes inline .",
    "for example , the triangular graph @xmath181(0.96,0.33)(1.38,-0.29 ) \\psline[linewidth=0.04cm](0.46,-0.51)(1.28,-0.51 ) \\psdots[dotsize=0.4](1.56,-0.51 ) \\psdots[dotsize=0.4](0.2,-0.53 ) \\psdots[dotsize=0.4](0.82,0.53 ) \\psline[linewidth=0.04cm](0.62,0.33)(0.3,-0.31 ) \\end{pspicture } } $ ] can be write inline as @xmath182 .",
    "one of the first mathematical equations we can think of is @xmath183 .",
    "this is an equation since we agree that the symbols @xmath184 mean exactly @xmath108 or that the statement @xmath183 is true .",
    "one key thing about equations is that we can also put a variable @xmath117 in an equation and then ask to find the value of @xmath117 which will make the equation true . in this case",
    ", the value of @xmath117 would be known as a solution of the equation .",
    "for example , if we want to solve the equation @xmath185 , we can say that @xmath108 is a solution of this equation . a solution of the equation @xmath186 would be @xmath187 .",
    "there is not always a unique solution , for example @xmath188 has @xmath159 and @xmath189 as solutions .",
    "equations are not only restricted to mathematics , but are in fact quite common . day to day questions such as `",
    "what is the time ? ' and ` how old are you ? ' can also be considered to be equations .",
    "for example , we can view the question ` what is the time ? ' as being asked to solve the equation @xmath190 and ` how old are you ? ' as solving for @xmath117 the equation @xmath191 .",
    "equations and solutions to equations are an essential part of a language . finding a remedy or discovering a more precise biological process",
    "can be viewed as finding the solution of equations involving transformations . because systems of transformations can also be reduced",
    ", our equations will take a different form .",
    "for now we will only define three types of equations , one involving the naming symbols and the other involving the reduction symbol .",
    "the equations @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 will mean that the label @xmath196 can be used instead of @xmath197 in any circumstance .",
    "note that after naming a transformation by using @xmath192 , we can stop using the colon symbol and write @xmath195 .",
    "the second type of equation is @xmath198 which can be read as ` the system of transformations x reduces to y ' . if the system @xmath107 also reduces to @xmath117 we will write @xmath199 .",
    "an example of this is when the two systems are the same but with different labels and names .",
    "note that @xmath200 is always true .",
    "if both @xmath117 and @xmath107 reduces to the same form @xmath201 we will write @xmath202 .",
    "this is also considered to be an equation .",
    "for example , the following two systems @xmath203 and @xmath204 reduce to the same form @xmath205 .",
    "@xmath206 @xmath207 thus we can write the equation @xmath208    when we have such an equation , we will say that the system @xmath203 and @xmath204 are _ reduction equivalent _ and write this as @xmath209 .",
    "this is our third type of equation .",
    "usually , equations will be expressions involving variables , forms , transformations , systems , naming symbols , the double arrow reduction symbols and the symbol ` @xmath210 ' .",
    "since reductions do not always terminate , it would eventually be interesting to define new types of relations to help compare different systems .",
    "we now present two short examples of solutions of equations .",
    "we will look at solutions to equations in more detail in section [ computing remedies ] . now that we have equations ( or reductions ) involving forms , we can include variables in an equation and ask which forms are solutions to this equation . for example , with @xmath88 as a variable , we can wonder which form will satisfy the equation @xmath211 the solution to this equation is @xmath212 . in the case of the equation",
    "@xmath213 the solution would be @xmath214 .",
    "we now give an example of finer and coarser model .",

    "applied to the form @xmath6 we get @xmath216 .",
    "applying the transformation @xmath217 followed by @xmath218 to @xmath6 will reduce also to @xmath216 .",
    "this means that @xmath219 is reduction equivalent to @xmath220 .",

    "most processes and features we observe in the body are resilient .",
    "this means that errors , mutations and modified processes are naturally eliminated from the body .",
    "we could use this as a way to compute unknown processes .",
    "when investigating a hypothetical process , we can evaluate the resilience of a process to determine if it is stable in the body and could have survived .",
    "we can probe and test the process by introducing errors in the flow of steps and see if the process destabilizes or not .",
    "if the process destabilizes with small interactions from the body itself or the environment , then this hypothetical process must be discarded .",
    "this is a very useful principle from a computational point of view . to solve a problem or find a representation of a biological process",
    ", the computer could generate many different processes and eliminate them by testing if they are resilient .",
    "for example , in a certain series of steps , if we know that something is produced at one of the steps , but do not know how it was produced , the computer could generate different ways ( using what is present in the cell or not ) and then test the resilience of each process . each process",
    "could also be tested for how they propagate in the system . if it implies a buildup somewhere else and it is never observed in reality , this process could be discarded .",
    "if the process disturbs the resilience of another process , thus making the other process disappear , then the process could also by discarded . a classical algorithm which might be useful here would be a genetic algorithm .",

    ". processes that we want to discover can often be close to an optimal solution .",

    "we will meet transformation equations that are uncomputable or out of reach .",
    "an idea would be to define an object that is a solution to the transformation equation and build a mathematical theory based on this definition .",

    "this permits us to use object programming techniques in our language .",
    "since we can build programming statements with transformations , this means that after building a scientific model in the language of transformations , we can build programs without leaving the language .",
    "this points toward a new and powerful programming language based on forms and transformations .",
    "if such a programming language is developed based on modern higher programming languages , one has to make extensive use of arrays and sub - arrays .",

    ", a transformation would be viewed as an array of two components where each component contains a @xmath476 by @xmath244 two - dimensional array .",
    "similarly for a 3d representation , one would use transformation components that are three - dimensional arrays .",
    "interestingly , this array - based approach to transformations points towards what we could understand as @xmath244-dimensional transformations and forms .",

    "our natural space could be written as @xmath540 , an object with no speed , occupying a space and associated with a unit of time of @xmath230 .",
    "a photon might be interpreted as @xmath541 and a neutrino as @xmath542 where @xmath543 is the neutrino speed at some energy @xmath544 .",
    "based on these objects , we could try to find a transformation force which account to many observed properties .",
    "our object @xmath539 could be represented as a rectangular prism such that the length is @xmath538 , the width is @xmath173 and height is @xmath327 .",
    "attached to the prism is also a vector of @xmath117 pointing in some direction .",
    "if we find the right force transformation , we could modify the unit of time as seen in relativity , investigate consequences of an invariant volume and maybe discover inner mechanisms explaining the interaction between space , energy and time .",
    "for example , if we take the sheet of space @xmath540 and assume that the area stays the same , stretching @xmath538 to @xmath159 would make @xmath545 .",
    "if we interpret @xmath173 as being the time it took to cover the last distance @xmath117 , then an object passing through this space will get the values @xmath546 and @xmath545 , thus making the speed of the object @xmath547 which can be understood as time dilatation .",
    "take again a sheet of space @xmath540 and assume that the area is an invariant . as time spends itself , then @xmath538 becomes greater which could be interpreted as an expanding space .",
    "time would need to be viewed as decreasing and not increasing , making time more like water evaporating .",
    "based on the assumption that photons are emitted in quanta , we are forced to conclude that there is a limit to what we can measure .",
    "this is also assuming that there are no other particles or techniques which can be used to have a lower limit .",
    "since what we want to measure now takes the form of a rectangular prism , one way to look at heisenberg s uncertainty principle is to take a small prism that has the sides of planck s units and assume the volume is invariant .",
    "thus , stretching a side of the prism will reduce the side of the others in a way which is similar to a reduction of @xmath548 implies an augmentation of @xmath549 . from this point of view , saying that our prism has an invariant volume , is another way to express the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "we now have the possibility to express each domain of science by using the same mathematical notation , this means that each science can directly benefit from the others .",
    "structures found or studied in one science can be applied or studied in another domain .",
    "for example , we can try to see if a new mathematical structure also appears in biology , neuroscience or chemistry .",
    "the point of view that comes with the language of transformations might be able to provide insights on the concept of emergence .",
    "we are presently at a place where most researchers have to interact with different fields of science to improve their understanding of the world and create beneficial technologies .",
    "the language which was presented is only a few steps towards improving the free exchange of ideas and the creation of a large interactive open - access scientific database .",
    "languages such as the one presented combined with a large scientific database can prove to be fruitful and powerful tools .",
    "it is the sincere hope of the author that every person involved will take the responsibility of making ethical choices aimed at benefiting each and every living being .",
    "we will now give a few more definitions and tools that are useful to manipulate systems of transformations .      until now , in our transformations , the cause of the transformation was defined as being the same as the elements in the initial form .",
    "we will now introduce a notation saying that the transformation will be applied to any disconnected form it meets .",
    "the transformation    @xmath550    is understand as replacing any symbol it meet by the form @xmath88 .",
    "for example , @xmath551 will reduce to @xmath552 and @xmath553 will also reduce to @xmath552 .",
    "we can also have more than one star in the cause of a transformation .",
    "for example , @xmath554 will also reduce to @xmath555 .",
    "we can also restrict the scope of the star symbol to a certain color by writing @xmath556 .",
    "if we apply this transformation three times to @xmath557 , this will give @xmath558 .",
    "the star symbol can also be written in the result of a transformation .",
    "an example of this is @xmath559 which permits the duplication of any form it meets .",
    "applying this transformation to an initial form containing a rabbit will give us a set of two rabbits .",
    "@xmath560    applying duplication two times to a set of three rabbits , will give a total of five rabbits and applying duplication three times to a set of three rabbits , will give a total of six rabbits . if we want to apply the duplication to each rabbit in the initial set , we can use the sharp symbol and write the following .",
    "@xmath561    in essence , we have multiplied the number of rabbits of the initial set by @xmath159 . similarly , multiplication by @xmath163 of a set of elements can be done with the transformation @xmath562 .",
    "another example from chemistry , a transformation replacing any element having a bond with carbon by an hydrogen can be written as @xmath563 .",
    "we now introduce the negation symbol @xmath564 . when this symbol is written before a form , it means that we are referring to all that is not that form in a set .",
    "for example , take the set @xmath565 , we can replace by a beautiful meadow all that is not the person in the office by using the symbol @xmath566 .",
    "@xmath567\\rightarrow   \\{\\textit{desk , computer , person , pen , phone}\\ } \\\\",
    "\\downarrow\\\\   \\{\\textit{beautiful meadow , person } \\ } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    we can also use the negation symbol in the effect of the transformation . let @xmath568 , also denoted by @xmath569 , be the set containing water mixed with different pollutants .",
    "the following transformation can be interpreted as a water filter which filters out all pollutants .",
    "@xmath570      until now the position or content of the initial set was fixed and did not change unless transformations were applied to it .",
    "we now want to show how we can have an initial form which is displaced after the application of a transformation .",
    "take the string of letters @xmath571 , we can define a transformation such that it is applied to the first three terms , then applied to the next three terms and then to the last three terms .",
    "we can use the ` @xmath572 ' notation to allow us to move the initial form .",
    "if we follow each transformation by the transformation @xmath573 we will displace the initial form .",
    "an example is given as follows .",
    "@xmath574      a collection of transformations applied in series to an initial form will often have different effects than if the transformations were applied in parallel . but depending on how the model was built , whether we apply the transformations in series or parallel , will have the same effect . eventually , it would be interesting to find a precise characterisation of systems which are reduced in the same way whether the transformations are applied in series or in parallel .",
    "here follows two examples of what we could call _ parallel - series invariant _ systems .",
    "@xmath575\\rightarrow ( ab).\\ ] ]    @xmath576\\rightarrow ( a , a , a).\\ ] ]      the paper was written in the typesetting language latex .",
    "most figures and diagrams where drawn in latex draw which generate pstricks code that can be copied directly in the latex document .",
    "the latex animate package was used for the animations . note",
    "that for the latex code to compile well , all the images needed to be of the encapsulated postscript ( _ .eps _ ) . for the animations to display well , the code needed to be compiled with xelatex , but for rapid compilation the sequence latex , dvi2ps and ps2pdf was used .",
    "the transformations are written with the following latex code .",
    "$ \\fbox\\{$b \\rhd a$}\\{\\,\\infty s}$    this code will display as follows .",
