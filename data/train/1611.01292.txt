    "the physical mechanisms by which pulsars radiate rotational energy are as yet unclear . the dominant process can be inferred by measuring a pulsar s _ braking index _ , @xmath6 , the index of a power law relating the pulsar s spin frequency , @xmath7 , to its spin - down rate , @xmath8 , via @xmath9 for example , the simple model of a pulsar as a spinning magnetic dipole predicts @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a pulsar s braking index can be calculated from measurements of the first two time - derivatives of its spin frequency , @xmath11 however , most young pulsars exhibit unpredictable fluctuations in their spin frequency on top of their long - term spin - down behavior @xcite known as _ timing noise_. observations spanning long time intervals are required to discriminate the overall braking behavior in these fluctuations .",

    "the data in which the pulsar was discovered spanned 2008  august  4 to 2014  october  1 and were produced using internal preliminary versions of the pass 8 instrument response functions ( irfs ) and background models .",
    "we included photons from within an @xmath18 region of interest ( roi ) around the 3fgl position , with a maximum zenith angle of @xmath19 , and a maximum cutoff on the lat s rocking angle of @xmath20 .",

    "in the blind search , this cutoff was @xmath24 , leaving @xmath25 `` effective '' photons . in the timing analysis , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .      the first stage of the survey employed a `` semicoherent '' search , in which only photons arriving within @xmath28  s ( @xmath29  days ) of one another were combined coherently @xcite .",

    "the integrated pulse profile from our initial timing solution showed significant emission above the background at all phases , indicative either of flux from the pulsar or from a nearby unmodeled source .    to investigate this unpulsed flux , we assigned rotational phases to all photons using our initial timing solution , and performed a spectral analysis of the off - pulse emission ( i.e. excluding photons with phases within the ranges shown in figure  [ f : pulse_profile ] ) .",
    "this revealed additional nearby gamma - ray sources , the closest and most significant of which lies @xmath35 from the pulsar s timing position , with a spectral index of @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the energy flux of psr  j1208@xmath06238 above 100  mev .",
    "the nature of these sources is unclear ; without likely counterparts at other wavelengths it is difficult to tell whether these are point sources or residuals from the galactic diffuse emission template .",
    "their steep spectra are consistent with lat - detected supernova remnants ( snrs ; * ? ? ?",
