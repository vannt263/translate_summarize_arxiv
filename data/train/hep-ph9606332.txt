    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) at hera is a copious source of multi - jet events .",

    "clearly , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections are mandatory on the theoretical side for such tests .",
    "full nlo corrections for one and two - jet production cross sections and distributions are now available and implemented in the @xmath5 jets event generator mepjet , which allows to analyze arbitrary jet definition schemes and general cuts in terms of parton 4-momenta@xcite . a variety of topics can be studied with these tools .",
    "\\1 ) the determination of @xmath0 over a range of scales @xmath1 from dijet production at hera : the dijet cross section is proportional to @xmath0 at leading order ( lo ) , thus suggesting a direct measurement of the strong coupling constant .",
    "however , the lo calculation leaves the renormalization scale @xmath1 undetermined .",
    "the nlo corrections substantially reduce the renormalization and factorization scale dependencies which are present in the lo calculations and thus reliable cross section predictions in terms of @xmath6 ( for a given set of parton distributions ) are made possible .",
    "clearly , a careful study of the choice of scale in the dijet cross section is needed in order to extract a reliable value for @xmath7 .",
    "we will present some arguments and studies of the scale dependence of the nlo dijet cross section which suggest that the average @xmath2 of the jets in the breit frame provides the `` natural '' scale for multi jet production in dis . here",
    ", @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 , where the subscripts @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the jet and proton , respectively ( all quantities are defined in the breit frame ) .",
    "2 ) the measurement of the gluon density in the proton ( via @xmath12 ) : the gluon density can only be indirectly constrained by an analysis of the structure function @xmath13 at hera @xcite .",
    "the boson gluon fusion subprocess dominates the two jet cross section at low @xmath4 and allows for a more direct measurement of the gluon density in this regime .",
    "a first lo experimental analysis has been presented in @xcite .",
    "nlo corrections reduce the factorization scale dependence in the lo calculation ( due to the initital state collinear factorization , which introduces a mixture of the quark and gluon densities according to the dglap ( altarelli - parisi ) evolution ) and thus reliable cross section predictions in terms of the scale dependent parton distributions are made possible . some implications for the determination of the gluon density",
    "have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) associated forward jet production in the low @xmath4 regime as a signal of bfkl dynamics : bfkl evolution @xcite leads to a larger cross section for events with a measured forward jet ( in the proton direction ) with transverse momentum @xmath14 close to @xmath15 than the dglap @xcite evolution .",
    "clearly , next - to - leading order qcd corrections for fixed order qcd , with altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution , are mandatory on the theoretical side in order to establish a signal for bfkl evolution in the data .",
    "we discuss these corrections in section 3 .",
    "the importance of higher order corrections and recombination scheme dependencies of the two jet cross sections for four different jet algorithms ( cone , @xmath16 @xcite , jade , w ) was already discussed in @xcite . while the higher order corrections and recombination scheme dependencies in the cone and @xmath16 schemes are small , very large corrections appear in the @xmath17-scheme .",
    "we conclude from these studies that the cone and @xmath16 schemes appear better suited for precision qcd tests and will concentrate only on those schemes in the following .",
    "the goal of a versatile nlo calculation is to allow for an easy implementation of an arbitrary jet algorithm and to impose any kinematical resolution and acceptance cuts on the final state particles .",
    "this is best achieved by performing all hard phase space integrals numerically , with a monte carlo integration technique .",
    "this approach also allows an investigation of the recombination scheme dependence of the nlo jet cross sections . for dijet production at hera",
    "such a nlo monte carlo program is mepjet@xcite .",
    "the calculation is based on the phase space slicing method and on the technique of universal `` crossing functions '' @xcite .",
    "more details are described in @xcite and we do not repeat them here .",
    "this technique can also be extended to the case of massive quark production @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique for the calculation of nlo corrections in jet physics is the `` subtraction '' method @xcite .",
    "jet production in dis is a multi - scale problem and it is not a priori clear at which scale @xmath18 is probed . in the following we will discuss the choice of the renormalization and factorization scale for dijet production at hera . as mentioned before ,",
    "the nlo corrections are expected to reduce the scale dependencies in the lo predictions provided the scale is of the order of the typical hardness of the partonic process .",
    "the following studies are done for the cone algorithm ( which is defined in the laboratory frame ) and the distance @xmath19 between two partons decides whether they should be recombined to a single jet . here",
    "the variables are the pseudo - rapidity @xmath20 and the azimuthal angle @xmath21 .",
    "we recombine partons with @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , a cut on the jet transverse momenta of @xmath23  gev in the lab is imposed .",
    "we employ the two loop formula for the strong coupling constant with a value for @xmath24 consistent with the value from the parton distribution functions .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is matched at the thresholds @xmath25 and the number of flavors is fixed to @xmath26 throughout , _",
    "i.e. _ gluons are allowed to split into five flavors of massless quarks .",
    "a running qed fine structure constant @xmath27 is used .",
    "in addition the following set of kinematical cuts is imposed on the initial virtual photon and on the final state electron and jets : we require 40  gev@xmath28 gev@xmath29 , @xmath30 , an energy cut of @xmath31  gev on the scattered electron , and a cut on the pseudo - rapidity @xmath32 of the scattered lepton and jets of @xmath33 .",
    "first studies of the scale dependence of the dijet cross section in the cone scheme are presented in @xcite .",
    "we have considered scales related to the scalar sum of the parton transverse momenta in the breit frame , @xmath34 , and the virtuality @xmath35 of the incident photon . in the following we will also consider scales related to @xmath36 . here",
    ", @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 , where the subscripts @xmath39 and @xmath11 denote the final parton ( or jet ) and proton , respectively ( all quantities are determined in the breit frame )",
    ". the breit frame is characterized by the vanishing energy component of the momentum of the exchanged photon .",
    "both the photon momentum @xmath40 and the proton momentum @xmath41 are chosen along the @xmath42-direction .",
    "@xmath4 is the standard bjorken scaling variable . in the parton model ,",
    "the incoming quark with momentum @xmath43 collides elastically with the virtual boson and is scattered in the opposite direction ( the current hemisphere ) with momentum @xmath44 ; therefore , @xmath45 in the limit of the quark parton model , whereas @xmath46 .",
    "the kinematics for dijet production is more complex : the momentum fraction @xmath20 of the incoming parton must be larger than @xmath4 since @xmath47 and , in general , the jets have a nonvanishing transverse momentum with respect to the @xmath48-proton direction . at lo ,",
    "i.e. for massless jets , the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 reads : @xmath51 obviously , @xmath52 , and one can also show that @xmath53 .",
    "thus , @xmath54 is approximately given by the harder of the two scales @xmath15 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "for large dijet invariant masses ( i.e. for `` true '' two jet kinematics ) one has @xmath56 , the dijet system will be strongly boosted in the proton direction and @xmath57 , as long as very small scattering angles in the center of mass frame are avoided . for @xmath58 or smaller , on the other hand , @xmath59 and , typically , both are considerably larger than @xmath60 ( in particular for @xmath61 , which corresponds to the parton model limit ) .    thus @xmath54 smoothly interpolates between the correct limiting scale choices , it approaches @xmath15 in the parton limit and it corresponds to the jet transverse momentum when the photon virtuality becomes negligible .",
    "it appears to be the `` natural '' scale for multi jet production in dis .    in @xcite",
    "we found that the scale dependence of the dijet cross section does not markedly improve in nlo for @xmath62 .",
    "this is also shown in fig .  1 ( dotted curves ) where the dependence of the two - jet cross section on the scale factor @xmath63 is shown .",
    "we used the parton distribution functions set mrs d-@xmath64 @xcite and employed the two loop formula for the strong coupling constant both in the lo and nlo curves . for scales related to @xmath34 the uncertainty from the variation of the renormalization and factorization scale",
    "is markedly reduced compared to the lo predictions ( dashed curves in fig .  1 ) .",
    "here @xmath63 is defined via @xmath65 the resulting @xmath63 dependence for @xmath66 is shown as the solid lines in fig .  1 .",
    "in this case , the nlo two - jet cross section is essentially independent on @xmath63 for @xmath67 .",
    "hence , the theoretical uncertainties due to the scale variation are very small suggesting a precise determination of @xmath68 for different @xmath3 bins , where @xmath69    ( 7,7 )    ( 7,7 )    ( 7,7 )    ( 7,7 )    fig .",
    "2 shows the @xmath3 distribution for the nlo exclusive dijet cross section .",
    "we used the parton distribution functions set grv @xcite and @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to the cuts imposed in fig .  1 , we require @xmath71  gev for each jet and @xmath72 gev .",
    "we have divided the nlo cross section in the following three @xmath3 bins .",
    "+ bin 1 : 5  gev @xmath73 10  gev + bin 2 : 10  gev @xmath74 15  gev + bin 3 : 15  gev @xmath75 .",
    "+ table  1 shows the corresponding nlo cross sections for these three bins for two different sets of parton distributions and for different values for the scale factor @xmath63 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties for the nlo dijet cross section from these numbers are very small , in particular for the first two bins .",
    "lccc & & & +   + @xmath76 & 497 & 320 & 146 + @xmath77 & 504 & 306 & 134 + @xmath78 & 488 & 322 & 151 + @xmath76 & 487 & 322 & 148 +    fig .",
    "3 and 4 show the @xmath79 and @xmath35 distribution for the nlo exclusive dijet cross section for these three bins . whereas the @xmath79 and @xmath35 distributions are fairly similar to the @xmath3 distribution for the lowest bin , large differences are found for the other bins .",
    "this partly explains the rather different scale dependence observed in fig.1 .",
    "deep inelastic scattering with a measured forward jet with relatively large momentum fraction @xmath80 ( in the proton direction ) and @xmath81 is expected to provide sensitive information about the bfkl dynamics at low @xmath4 @xcite . in this region",
    "there is not much phase space for dglap evolution with transverse momentum ordering , whereas large effects are expected for bfkl evolution in @xmath4 . in particular ,",
    "bfkl evolution is expected to substantially enhance cross sections in the region @xmath82 @xcite . in order to extract information on the @xmath83 bfkl evolution",
    ", one needs to show that cross section results based on fixed order qcd with dglap evolution are not sufficient to describe the data .",
    "clearly , next - to - leading order qcd corrections to the dglap predictions are needed to make this comparison between experiment and theory .    in table",
    "[ table2 ] we show numerical results for the multi jet cross sections with ( or without ) a forward jet .",
    "the lo ( nlo ) results are based on the lo ( nlo ) parton distributions from grv @xcite together with the one - loop ( two - loop ) formula for the strong coupling constant .",
    "kinematical cuts are imposed to closely model the h1 event selection@xcite .",
    "more specifically , we require @xmath84gev@xmath29 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , an energy cut of @xmath87  gev on the scattered electron , and a cut on the pseudo - rapidity @xmath32 of the scattered lepton of @xmath88 ( corresponding to @xmath89 ) .",
    "jets are defined in the cone scheme ( in the laboratory frame ) with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we require a forward jet with @xmath92 , @xmath93 gev , @xmath94 , and a cut on the pseudo - rapidity of @xmath95 ( corresponding to @xmath96 ) .",
    "in addition all jets must have transverse momenta of at least 4 gev in the lab frame and 2 gev in the breit frame .",
    "lcc & & + & & +   + & 0 pb & 9026 pb + & 19.3 pb & 2219 pb + & 68 pb & 2604 pb + & 30.1 pb & 450 pb +    the cross sections of table  [ table2 ] demonstrate first of all that the requirement of a forward jet with large longitudinal momentum fraction ( @xmath97 ) and restricted transverse momentum ( @xmath94 ) severely restricts the available phase space , in particular for low jet multiplicities .",
    "the 1-jet exclusive cross section vanishes at lo , due to the contradicting @xmath85 and @xmath97 requirements . for @xmath82 ,",
    "a high invariant mass hadronic system must be produced by the photon - parton collision and this condition translates into @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the transverse mass and rapidity of the partonic recoil system , respectively .",
    "thus a recoil system with substantial transverse momentum and/or invariant mass must be produced and this condition favors recoil systems composed out of at least two additional energetic partons .    as a result one finds very large fixed order perturbative qcd corrections ( compare 2 jet lo and nlo results with a forward jet in table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the lo @xmath101 3-jet cross section is larger than the lo @xmath102 2-jet cross section . thus , the forward jet cross sections in table  [ table2 ] are dominated by the @xmath101 matrix elements .",
    "the effects of bfkl evolution must be seen and isolated on top of these fixed order qcd effects .",
    "we will analyze these effects in a subsequent publication .",
    "the calculation of nlo perturbative qcd corrections has received an enormous boost with the advent of full nlo monte carlo programs @xcite . for dijet production at hera",
    "the nlo monte carlo program mepjet @xcite allows to study jet cross sections for arbitrary jet algorithms . internal jet structure , parton / hadron recombination effects , and the effects of arbitrary acceptance cuts",
    "can now be simulated at the full @xmath103 level .",
    "we found large nlo effects for some jet definition schemes ( in particular the @xmath17-scheme ) and cone and @xmath16 schemes appear better suited for precision qcd tests .",
    "the extraction of gluon distribution functions is now supported by a fully versatile nlo program .",
    "preliminary studies show that large nlo corrections are present in the bjorken @xmath4 distribution for dijet events , while these effects are mitigated in the reconstructed feynman @xmath4 ( @xmath104 ) distribution , thus aiding the reliable extraction of @xmath105 .    for the study of bfkl evolution by considering events with a forward `` mueller''-jet very large qcd corrections",
    "are found at @xmath103 .",
