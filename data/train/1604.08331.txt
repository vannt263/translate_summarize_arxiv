    "red nuggets are found to be as compact as @xmath2 kpc , which is comparable to the size of the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ point - spread function ( psf ) .",

    ", cosmological simulations predict the formation of massive disk galaxies at these epochs .",
    "the compactness of red nuggets indicates that these galaxies have experienced severe dissipation during their formation .",
    "one plausible scenario is that the red nuggets are the end result of major gas - rich mergers .",
    "@xcite find that nearly all their simulated gas - rich merger remnants contain rapidly rotating stellar substructure , while disk - dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are gas - dominated at the time of final coalescence .",
    "they show that the formation of rotationally supported stellar systems in mergers is not restricted to idealized orbits , and both gas - rich major and minor mergers can produce disk - dominated stellar remnants .",
    "their findings can be especially important for galaxy formation at high redshifts , where gas - dominated mergers are common .",
    "measuring the bulge and disk properties , and subsequently the luminosity bulge - to - total ratio ( @xmath1 ) , of galaxies obviously can reveal key properties and clues to formation and evolutionary paths that may be obscured by studying a bulge+disk galaxy as a single system .",
    "several factors can affect the reliability of bulge - disk decomposition , including how the fitting pipeline is employed , the galaxy brightness [ signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath8 ) ] , cosmological surface brightness dimming , and the effect of the psf .",
    "one of the best ways for quantifying the influence of these factors is through galaxy simulations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for high-_z _ galaxies , and @xcite and @xcite for low-_z _ galaxies ) .",
    "this work employs well - tested properties and scaling relations of local galaxies to generate mock bulge+disk galaxies with a uniform and wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "this provides the most complete set of simulations to date that allows us to examine the robustness of two - component decomposition of disk galaxies at different @xmath1 values .",
    "although our model bulge+disk galaxies do not capture the full observed complexity of local disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , recent zoom - in cosmological simulations find that galaxies with bars and spiral structures are rare at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if higher redshift bulges and disks resemble their local counterparts , the results of our rescaled model galaxies can be used as a yardstick for examining the robustness of these types of analysis for higher redshift galaxies .",

    "\\3 ) what are the best methods for measuring the @xmath1 of composite galaxies ? and what are the potential biases of different bulge - disk fitting methods ?    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the details of the galaxy simulations",

    "the special cases of the srsic profile are the exponential profile ( _ n _ = 1 ; @xcite ) and the _ @xmath19 _ law ( _ n _ = 4 ; @xcite ) , which are commonly observed in spiral and elliptical galaxies , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the srsic index can be used as a yardstick for distinguishing the disk - dominated from the bulge - dominated galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we aim to simulate galaxies that resemble real , observed disk galaxies . toward this goal",
    ", we use empirical scaling relations and other empirical constraints derived from observations of nearby galaxies as inputs to create the model galaxies . although these constraints reduce the generality of our simulated sample , they provide us with simulated galaxies that exhibit realistic values of bulge and disk component parameters .    the well - known kormendy relation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , a projection of the galaxy fundamental plane ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , reveals that elliptical galaxies and classical bulges follow a correlation between effective surface brightness ( @xmath20 ) and effective radius ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the kormendy relation indicates that larger elliptical galaxies and classical bulges have lower densities .",
    "since brighter galaxies are bigger , a more general statement is that more luminous systems are fluffier .",
    "the kormendy relation , which has played an important role in the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies , has been studied in different bands ( e.g. , @xcite ) , environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) , redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and magnitude ranges ( @xcite ) .    our simulated images of fiducial local ( @xmath21 ) galaxies will be designed to mimic sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",

    "gadotti ( 2009 ) claims that `` pseudo - bulges can be distinguished from classical bulges as outliers in the kormendy relation . ''",
    "based on the fact that our simulated bulges follow the kormendy relation , one might say that pseudo - bulges are not included in our sample . however , fisher & drory ( 2008 ) argue that the main structural difference between pseudo and classical bulges is that the former has lower sersic indices . without meaning to favor one definition over another , according to fisher & drory ( 2008 ) definition ,",
    "pseudo - bulges are present in our simulated sample .",
    "definitions aside , as a prelude to the results , one can infer how well bulges can be fit ( pseudo or not ) regardless of the relation they follow because the accuracy of recovery can be summarized from direct measurables alone : luminosity , size , and @xmath1 ratio . in short ,",
    "if pseudo - bulges span a range that is lower in @xmath8 , lower in angular resolution , and lower in @xmath1 than our simulations , then they would not be easily recovered at high-_z _ , independent of which physical relations they follow .",
    "the ellipticity , @xmath31 , of bulges have a gaussian distribution that peaks around 0.2 ( fathi et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas disks , as a result of different inclination angles , have @xmath32 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume disks and bulges have random orientations ( position angles ) .",
    "the simulated disks have a gaussian distribution of central surface brightness , with a mean and standard deviation of @xmath33 mag @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these initial conditions lead to a sample of model galaxies with 0.1 @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath5 0.7 , with the majority of the objects having 0.25 @xmath5 @xmath1 @xmath5 0.5 .",
    "there are more than 500 galaxies in each of the following bins of @xmath1 : @xmath50.2 , 0.20.3 , 0.40.3 , 0.40.5 , 0.50.6 , and @xmath40.6 .",
    "this produces bulges with @xmath34 0.45  ( 112 pixels ) and disks with @xmath35 3.510(925 pixels ) . in this paper ,",
    "the analyzed effective radii are circularized effective radii , @xmath36 ; the same applies to the disk scale lengths .",
    "figures [ fig : bulge ] and [ fig : disk ] show the properties of the simulated bulges and disks .",
    "figure [ fig : disk]f shows that galaxies with the smallest @xmath1 have the lowest @xmath37 , in agreement with previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for this analysis ,",

    ", the size of the simulated images should be at least 15 times larger than the effective radius of the galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as the simulated images are meant to resemble sdss data , the pixel scale is set to 0.396 , and the zero point of the images is set to 25 mag , typical for the sdss @xmath22 band .",
    "we convolve the simulated images with an empirical psf constructed by stacking 30 bright stars selected from sdss @xmath22-band images .",
    "@xmath8 is a key factor for the robustness of morphological analysis .",
    "considering the fact that galaxies are extended objects , we use the @xmath8 within the effective radius rather than the total @xmath8 .",
    "we define    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the area within the effective radius and @xmath40 is the sum of all possible sources of noise , including dark current , readout noise , and shot noise from the sky .    for each model galaxy ,",

    "objects with low @xmath8 look like compact galaxies due to the missing light in the outer part of the disk .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to examine the reliability of model fits of high - redshift massive galaxies using one or two srsic components .",
    "these high - redshift galaxies are generally smaller than local galaxies , have been observed at lower @xmath8 , and have been subject to surface brightness dimming .",
    "we simply rescale the size and @xmath8 as if the local galaxies are observed at _ z _ @xmath0 2 without taking the size evolution or stellar population evolution into account .",
    "this leads to simulated galaxies with bulges with 0.02  @xmath45 0.25  ( 0.34 pixels ) and disks with 0.17  @xmath46 0.5  ( 38 pixels ) .",
    "the rescaled model galaxies are simulated at 10 @xmath41 1000 ( uniformly distributed in logarithmic space ) , and their images mimic the properties of the candels ( @xcite ; @xcite ) uds ( ukidss ultra - deep survey ; @xcite ) mosaic image . for images with the noise level of those acquired using _",

    "the simulated images are convolved with the hybrid @xmath47 psf from candels uds ( @xcite ) .",
    "once the galaxies are simulated , we fit each of them in two ways : ( 1 ) single srsic component plus a sky component and ( 2 ) a srsic component ( to represent a bulge ) , an exponential component ( to represent a disk ) , and a sky component .",
    "the sky component is fitted as a plane with a constant slope , to correct for any residual non - flatness , to first order , for all the following analysis .",
    "all parameters are left free ( including the sky component parameters ) except when the disk or / and bulge srsic index is fixed . besides , no constraint file ( for limiting the parameter space ) is used for galfit fits .",

    "we first discuss the results for single - component fits , the method most widely adopted in the literature to obtain the total luminosity and basic structural parameters of galaxies .",

    "are generally unreliable .",
    "this comes from the fact that srsic profiles with @xmath17 @xmath4 4 have a long tail , which can be confused by the background signal and its associated noise .",
    "this generally causes overestimation of the total flux and size of a galaxy .",
    "we refit these galaxies with @xmath17 @xmath4 6 by fixing @xmath17 to 6 , to minimize potential biases caused by these unreliable fits .",
    "comparing dark and light green points in figure [ fig:1comp_z0 ] demonstrates the significant improvement in the size determination for best - fit models with high srsic indices .",
    "all the reported results allow the sky component to be free .",

    "the increase in the sky value , however , is not necessarily large . for large srsic indices ( @xmath49 4 ) it is typical that a small change in sky value can produce a large swing in the index value .",
    "we note that fixing @xmath17 to different values leads to different biases for galaxies at different @xmath1 range .",
    "for example , fixing @xmath17 to 2.5 will reduce biases for galaxies with 0.2 @xmath50 0.4 .",
    "however , when @xmath17 grows larger than 4 , it is common to hold it fixed to 4 . for our sample disky galaxies , holding @xmath17 fixed to 4 should reduce the systematics compared to @xmath17=6 , but the differences are not large .",

    "the best strategy is to leave the srsic index of the bulge free , while adding an exponential component for the disk .",
    "fixing the bulge srsic index to @xmath89 introduces systematic biases , apart from removing any information on @xmath17 . at higher @xmath1 ,",
    "especially , using this method tends to overestimate bulge total flux and effective radius and underestimate those of the disk component .",
