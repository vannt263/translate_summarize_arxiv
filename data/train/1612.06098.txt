    "multi - modal imaging is increasingly performed to obtain disease - specific complementary data throughout diagnosis - treatment - follow - up procedures .",
    "a reliable cross - modal image retrieval system is desirable as it carries immense potential in aiding decision - making by enabling access to all information across modalities that share semantic similarity .",
    "in contrast to single - modal image retrieval that has been an active research topic  @xcite , the cross modal image retrieval has not yet been fully investigated for medical applications except few works  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite that are also mainly adopted for health care management systems using text+image datasets . in cross - modal retrieval task , the ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between feature spaces by mining their mutual correlations and unveiling similarities within a latent common space . to this end",
    ", several methods have been developed but the canonical correlation analysis ( cca )  @xcite and its variants ( ex .",
    "@xcite ) have been widely used for learning such a space by maximizing the correlation between the two feature spaces . alternatively , learning coupled feature spaces ( lcfs )  @xcite and procrustes alignment  @xcite algorithms have been proposed , where the former focuses on selecting discriminative features while learning the subspace and the latter removes translational , rotational , and scaling components from one space so that the optimal alignment can be achieved . in general , majority of existing methods only preserve local geometries amongst features and ignore global geometries . in other words , they only ensure that similar instances in the original space become neighbors in the latent space but do not prevent dissimilar instances from being neighbors .",
    "authors in  @xcite addressed this problem by projecting instances into latent space through recovered mapping functions upon partially corresponding instances and aligning the manifolds while preserving the global geometries .",
    "the data across imaging modalities are inherently heterogeneous due to differences in physics of acquisitions and protocols .",
    "therefore , we need to preserve local structures that carry information about population variability and at the same time preserve the global manifold geometries for coping up with disease heterogeneity .",
    "this motivated us to develop the cross - modal manifold learning ( c@xmath0l ) image retrieval algorithm that respects both geometries in the latent space , which is accounted as the main contribution of this paper .",
    "this is achieved by : 1 ) incorporating pmst  @xcite into c@xmath0l such that the original data skeleton is preserved and partially corresponding instances drive the alignment , and 2 ) introducing novel notion of proximity through inter- and intra - modality affinity matrices for maintaining local similarities within constructed graph neighborhood . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first work on cross - modal medical image retrieval and as proof of concept , we apply c@xmath0l on two datasets for two different applications . for _ classification",
    "_ , we deployed coronary atherosclerosis histology images stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( hne ) and movat pentachrome ( mp ) .",
    "each stain provides distinctive information about atherosclerotic tissues that are interpreted in search of vulnerable plaques  @xcite , which has high clinical significance .",
    "the need for cross - modal retrieval arises when either of two stains are available ( _ query _ ) and the histopathologist desires access to the complementary stained image for differential assessment and tissue labeling that is otherwise very tedious and time consuming . ideally , the retrieved regions of interest should share the same semantic similarity in terms of the disease and arterial morphology as that of the query . for _ regression",
    "_ , we used brats dataset , which comprises of 3d scans of 188 high grade gliomas ( hgg ) and 25 low grade gliomas ( lgg ) acquired with four mri contrast schemes : t1 , tic , t2 , and flair ( refer to  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "we pose the task of cross - modal retrieval for scenarios where any triad of the above four modalities are available ( _ query _ ) and the neurologist seeks the other complementary modality for improved diagnosis and treatment planning . ideally , the retrieved cross - modal volume / region should share similarity in tumor composition to that of the query triad and similarity in the tumor staging .",
    "l : given modalities @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and limited corresponding instances ( @xmath3 ) , we model the intra - modal proximity with pmst .",
    "we then leverage @xmath3 through c@xmath0l and learn to map them to the joint feature space @xmath4.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    given two sets of multi - modal images @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as a prerequisite , we collect @xmath7 number of partially corresponding data ( tuples ) from both modalities constituting @xmath8 .",
    "we reconstitute @xmath1 into two disjoint subsets : @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( with and without given tuples , respectively ) and likewise partition @xmath2 . in presence of limited correspondences ,",
    "just preserving neighborhood relationships amongst matching instances would result in overfitting , thus limiting generalization .",
    "c@xmath0l overcomes this by using @xmath10 and @xmath11 together with @xmath3 such that the whole global geometries of two underlying manifolds are coupled and aligned in the joint feature space .",
    "the c@xmath0l casts the retrieval problem into learning a latent metric @xmath12-dimensional space @xmath13 wherein @xmath1 and @xmath2 become comparable ( @xmath14 ) .    the overall geometry encompassing both intra- and inter - modal global geometries of the aligning manifolds can be model as a @xmath15 joint distance matrix @xmath16 representing the pairwise dissimilarity between any two instances in @xmath17 .",
    "the joint manifold geometry is defined as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is an identity matrix ( construction of @xmath16 is discussed later )  @xcite .",

    "the former is discovered within modality neighborhoods and modeled as intra - modal pmsts .",
    "the inter - modality neighborhoods are then inferred using @xmath3 , which act as ` links ' and aid in aligning the intra - modal pmsts such that similar instances across modalities are mapped close to one another in the learnt manifold space ensuring exclusion of dissimilar points within local neighborhood ( see fig .",

    "step 1 ` _ * pmst * _ : the minimum spanning tree ( mst ) of a data distribution effectively represents the underlying skeleton of a manifold , preserves local structures , and does not introduce _ gaps _ between small random groupings of data points , which guarantees connectedness of a graph . however , mst is too sparse and sensitive to noise and therefore a fully - connected graph is often constructed , resulting in erroneous connections traveling outside of an underlying manifold when maximizing inter - modality proximity . to resolve this issue , we employed pmst , which is an ensemble of msts applied on perturbed versions of the original data distribution ( mst@xmath24 ) , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 $ ] that is locally adaptive noise model  @xcite .",

    "the final edge weight between two @xmath30 and @xmath31 instances in the pmst neighborhood graph ( say @xmath32 ) is computed as @xmath33 .",
    "next , we define the intra - modal proximity graph , deploying these two constructed pmst graphs , @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 data points , respectively .    `",
