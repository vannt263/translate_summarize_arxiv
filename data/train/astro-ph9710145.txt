    "the magnitude and shape of the intergalactic infrared radiation field ( iirf ) are fundamental to understanding the early evolution of galaxies .",
    "the iirf is produced by the emission of radiation from the photospheres of cool stars , dust reradiation , and redshifting to even longer wavelengths .",
    "the iirf is especially sensitive to the `` instantaneous '' rates of star formation at a given redshift , since much of the energy in bursts of new star formation escapes in the infrared after being reradiated by dust .",
    "the study of the iirf is therefore of great cosmological significance .",
    "we have previously pointed out ( stecker , de jager and salamon 1992 ( sds92 ) ) that very high energy @xmath0-ray  beams from blazars can be used to measure the intergalactic infrared radiation field , since pair - production interactions of @xmath0-rays  with intergalactic ir photons will attenuate the high - energy ends of blazar spectra . determining the intergalactic ir field , in turn ,",
    "allows us to model the evolution of the galaxies which produce it .",
    "as energy thresholds are lowered in both existing and planned ground - based air cherenkov light detectors ( cresti 1996 ) , cutoffs in the @xmath0-ray  spectra of more distant blazars are expected , owing to extinction by the low energy stellar photons .",
    "these can be used to explore the redshift dependence of the stellar emissivity .",
    "furthermore , by using blazars for a determination of attenuation as a function of redshift , combined with a direct observation of the ir background from the _ dirbe _ detector on _ cobe _ , one can , in principle , measure of the hubble constant @xmath4 at truly cosmological distances ( salamon , stecker and de jager 1994 ) .",
    "the potential importance of the photon - photon pair - production process in high energy astrophysics was first pointed out by nikishov ( 1961 ) .",
    "unfortunately , his early paper overestimated the energy density of the iirf by about three orders of magnitude .",
    "however , with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation , jelley ( 1966 ) and gould and schreder ( 1967 ) were quick to point out the opacity of the universe to photons of energy greater than 100 tev .",
    "stecker ( 1969 ) and fazio and stecker ( 1970 ) generalized these calculations to high redshifts , showing that photons originating at a redshift @xmath5 will be absorbed above an energy of @xmath6 tev .",
    "there are now over 50 grazars which have been detected by the _",
    "egret _ team ( thompson , _ et al . _  1996",
    "these sources , optically violent variable quasars and bl lac objects , have been detected out to a redshift greater that 2 .",
    "egret_strength `` grazar '' ( observed @xmath0-rayblazar ) with a hard spectrum extending to multi - tev energies is potentially detectable with ground - based telescopes ( see the review on the atmospheric cherenkov technique by weekes ( 1988 ) ) .",
    "pair - production interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cbr ) will not cut off the @xmath0-rayspectrum of a low - redshift source below an energy of @xmath7 tev ( see above ) .",
    "however , as pointed out in sds92 , even bright blazars at moderate redshifts ( @xmath8 ) will suffer absorption at tev energies owing to interactions with the iirf .",
    "shortly after sds92 was published , the whipple observatory group reported the discovery of @xmath1 tev @xmath0-rays  coming from the blazar mrk 421 , a bl lac object with a redshift of 0.031 ( punch _ et al . _",
    "this source has a hard , roughly @xmath9 , @xmath0-ray  spectrum extending to the tev energy range ( mohanty , _ et al . _  1993",
    "; lin , _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) where the pair - production process involving infrared photons becomes relevant . following this discovery , we made use of the tev observations of mrk 421 to carry out our suggestion of using such sources to probe the iirf ( stecker and de jager 1993 ; de jager , stecker and salamon 1994 ) .",
    "this problem was also discussed by dwek and slavin ( 1994 ) and biller , _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) . the tev spectrum of mrk 421 obtained by the whipple observatory group ( mohanty _ et al . _  1993 ) showed no significant absorption out to an energy of at least 3 tev .",
    "it is this lack of absorption below 3 tev which we ( stecker and de jager 1993 ) used to put upper limits on the extragalactic infrared energy density in the @xmath1 1 @xmath10 m to 8 @xmath10 m wavelength range ( see also dwek and slavin 1994 ) .    our upper limits on the iirf , obtained from the whipple data on mrk 421 below 3 tev , ruled out various exotic mechanisms for producing larger fluxes , such as decaying particles , exploding stars , massive object and black hole models ( carr 1988 ) .",
    "they are consistent with the extragalactic near infrared background originating from ordinary stellar processes in galaxies ( stecker , puget and fazio 1977 ; franceschini _ et al . _  1994",
    "; see also the papers included in dwek 1996 ) .    the paper by de jager , _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) attempted to estimate the iirf based on prelimary data on the spectrum of mrk421 given by mohanty , _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1993 ) , data which indicated that there may be absorption above 3 tev in that source .",
    "recent observations of mrk421 in the flaring state by the same group with much better statistics indicate no absorption or weak absorption out to an energy of at least @xmath18 tev ( mcenery , _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) ; thus , the analysis of de jager , _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) no longer holds .",
    "we examine the implications of the new mrk421 data later in this paper .    of all of the blazars detected by _ egret _",
    ", only the low - redshift bl lac , mrk 421 , has been seen by the whipple telescope .",

    "kerrick , _ et al . _",
    "1993 ) is consistent with the predictions of a cutoff for a source at its much higher redshift of 0.54 ( see sds92 ) .",

    "redshift out to a redshift of 0.3 , we apply our calculations to the high - energy @xmath0-ray  spectra of mrk 421 and mrk 501 and compare our results with recent spectral data on mrk 421 as reported by mcenery , _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) and spectral data on mrk 501 given by aharonian , _ et al . _  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the results presented here supercede those of our previous calculations ( stecker & de jager 1997 ) , which were based more on theoretical models ( see discussion in malkan & stecker 1998 ) .",
    "a theoretical upper limit to the intergalactic infrared energy density whose ultimate origin is stellar nucleosynthesis was given by stecker _",
    "et al._(1977 ) . direct observational limits on the iirf , determined by analysis of the _ cobe / dirbe _",
    "data with other components subtracted out , has been given by hauser ( 1996 ) .",
    "both of these determinations are well below the limits obtained by biller , _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) .",
    "biller , _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) argued that the most conservative estimate of an upper limit on the iirf would be obtained by taking the flattest spectral index for mrk 421 consistent with _",
    "egret _ data at gev energies and assuming that the spectrum of mohanty et al .",
    "( 1993 ) is the result of absorption with an optical depth @xmath12 in the tev energy range .",
    "the huge iirf required to obtain this optical depth is inconsistent with the _ cobe / dirbe _ data ( hauser 1996 ) .",
    "also , in order to produce a power - law absorbed @xmath0-ray  spectrum from a different power - law source spectrum in the tev energy range , they had to employ an unphysical sed which is inconsistent with that produced by theoretical models of stellar and dust emission from galaxies .",
    "recently , puget , _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) have claimed a tentative detection of the far - infrared background from an analysis of _ cobe _ data at wavelengths greater than 200 @xmath10 m .",
    "we have obtained an upper limit to the iirf ( stecker and de jager 1993 ) based on an analysis of the preliminary spectrum of mrk 421 at tev energies obtained by the whipple group ( mohanty , _ et al . _",
    "all of these direct and indirect observational results can be brought together into a coherent scenario where the iirf is assumed to be generated by stellar processes in galaxies .",
    "the resulting iirf from both starlight and dust reradiation should then have a two - peaked sed made up of the contributions from all of the galaxies in the universe .",
    "the energy flux of the iirf is expected to be roughly within a factor of two of the value of 10 nwm@xmath13sr@xmath14 .",
    "most recently , new estimates of the sed for the iirf were obtained by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) , based on the following empirical data : ( 1 ) the luminosity dependent infrared seds of galaxies , ( 2 ) the 60@xmath10 m luminosity function of galaxies and , ( 3 ) the redshift distribution of galaxies .",
    "this empirically based determination , is consistent with the limits given by stecker & de jager ( 1993 ) and the determination of puget , _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we consider it to be the most accurate estimate of the iirf and will use it here to calculate intergalactic absorption at low redshifts and multi - tev energies .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the extragalactic infrared background from galaxy emission calculated by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) together with the cosmic microwave background spectrum ( cmbr ) . the ir - sed given by the solid curve in figure 1 assumes evolution out to @xmath15 , whereas the ir - sed given by the short dashed curve assumes evolution out to @xmath16 .",
    "evolution in stellar emissivity is expected to level off or decrease at redshifts greater than @xmath17 ( fall , charlot & pei 1996 , madau 1996 ) and evidence for this is discussed in section 5.1 .",

    "the formulae relevant to calculations involving the pair - production process are given and discussed in sds92 .",
    "for @xmath0-rays in the tev energy range , the pair - production cross section is maximized when the soft photon energy is in the infrared range : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the compton wavelength of the electron . for a 1 tev @xmath0-ray",
    ", this corresponds to a soft photon having a wavelength near the k - band ( 2.2@xmath10 m ) .",
    "( pair - production interactions actually take place with photons over a range of wavelengths around the optimal value as determined by the energy dependence of the cross section . )",
    "if the emission spectrum of an extragalactic source extends beyond 20 tev , then the extragalactic infrared field should cut off the _ observed _ spectrum between @xmath21 gev and @xmath22 tev , depending on the redshift of the source ( stecker & salamon 1997 ; salamon & stecker 1998 , and this paper ) .    the technique for calculating the pair - production optical depth as a function of energy and redshift",
    "is given in sds92 . in order to calculate the absorption of multi - tev @xmath0-rays  by ir photons",
    ", we make the reasonable simplifying assumption that the ir background is basically in place at a redshifts @xmath18 0.3 , having been produced primarily at higher redshifts ( cowie , _ et al . _  1996",
    "; madau 1996 ; stecker & salamon 1997 ; salamon & stecker 1998 and references therein ) .",

    "absorption of @xmath0-rays from blazars and extragalactic @xmath0-ray bursts is strongly dependent on the redshift of the source ( sds92 ) .",
    "the study of extragalactic absorption below 0.3 tev at higher redshifts is a complex and physically interesting subject . in order to calculate such absorption properly",
    ", one must determine the spectral evolution of galaxy starlight photons from the ir through the uv range out to high redshifts .",
    "pei & fall ( 1995 ) have devised a clever method for calculating stellar emissivity as a function of redshift , one which is consistent with all recent data .",
    "salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) ( see also stecker & salamon 1997 ) have calculated the stellar emissivity at high redshifts by following the method of pei & fall ( 1995 ) and also taking the evolution of stellar metallicity into account .",
    "the idea of the pei & fall ( 1995 ) approach is to relate the star formation rate to the evolution of neutral gas density in damped ly@xmath42 systems and then to use the population synthesis models ( bruzal & charlot 1993 ) to calculate the mean volume emissivity of the universe from stars as a function of redshift and frequency .",
    "damped ly@xmath42 systems are believed to be either the precursors to galaxies or young galaxies themselves .",
    "it is in these systems that initial star formation probably took place , so that there is a relationship between the mass content of stars and gas in these clouds .",
    "the results obtained by fall , _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) show excellent agreement with observational data obtained by the canada - france redshift survey group for redshifts out to 1 ( lilly , _",

    "the stellar emissivity is found to peak between a redshift of 1 and 2 which is consistent with the results of ongoing observations from both the hubble and keck telescopes .",
    "recent evidence for this peak in the redshift distribution has been given by connolly , _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) .",
    "salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) have modified the calculations of fall , _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) by attempting to account for the significantly lower metallicity of early generation stars at higher redshifts which results in increased emission at shorter wavelengths and less emission at longer wavelengths . in order to estimate this effect ,",
    "they have used the results of worthey ( 1994 ) and moderately extrapolated them to both lower and higher wavelengths .",
    "they have also considered the effect of dust opacity and have assumed a reasonable escape factor to account for the fact that a small fraction of lyman continuum photons escape from galaxies unattenuated by stars and dust .",
    "the effect of this escape factor on opacity calculations is negligible , since there are not enough ionizing photons in intergalactic space to provide a significant opacity to multi - gev @xmath0-rays .",
    "once the spectral energy density distribution of stellar photons in intergalactic space as a function of redshift is determined , the opacity of the universe to @xmath0-rays  via pair - production as a function of @xmath0-ray  energy and redshift can be calculated ( sds92 ) .",
    "the results obtained by salamon & stecker ( 1998 ) indicate that @xmath0-rays  above an energy of @xmath115 gev will be attenuated if they are emitted at redshifts greater than or equal to @xmath13 .",
