    "our study advances understanding of the nonlinear nature of the axoneme , typically studied at the linear level @xcite .",
    "+ the origin of the bending wave instability can be understood as a consequence of the antagonistic action of dyneins competing along the flagellum @xcite .",
    "the instability is then further stabilized by the nonlinear coupling between dynein activity and flagellum shape , without the need to invoke a nonlinear axonemal response to account for the saturation of the unstable modes , in contrast to previous studies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the governing equations ( eqs . [ eq9_2 ] and [ eq10 ] ) contain all the nonlinearities in the limit of small curvature , and they are not the result of a power expansion to leading nonlinear order @xcite .",
    "far from the hopf bifurcation , linearized solutions fail to describe the flagellar shape and nonlinear effects arise in the system solely due to motor activity . at the nonlinear level , both the tangent angle and dynein population dynamics exhibit relaxation or cusp - like oscillations at some regions along the flagellum .",
    "similar cusp - like shapes for the curvature have also been reported in sea urchin sperm @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology is characteristic of motor assemblies working in far - from - equilibrium conditions and has been found in other biological systems such as in the spontaneous oscillations of myofibrils @xcite .",
    "interestingly , despite the low duty ratio of axonemal dynein , a fraction of @xmath198 % bound dyneins along the flagellum is sufficient to drive micrometer - sized amplitude oscillations .",
    "angular deflections are found to be @xmath199 rad in the experimentally relevant activity range @xmath200 and the order of magnitude seems not to be crucially affected by viscosity nor other parameters in the system .",
    "hence , despite of the fact that our description provides an intrinsic mechanism for amplitude saturation , it is only able to generate small deflections , typically an order of magnitude smaller than the ones reported for bull sperm flagella @xcite .",
    "other structural constraints , such as line tension , are likely to influence the amplitude saturation , due to the elastohydrodynamic coupling with motor activity ( see supplementary text ) .",
    "the presence of tension on the self - organized beating of flagella was previously investigated at leading nonlinear order ; however , deflections were also found to be small @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude that a ` sliding - controlled ' mechanism may not be sufficient to generate large deflections .",
    "our work adds to other recent studies were the ` sliding - controlled ' hypothesis seems to lose support as the main mechanism responsible for flagellar beating @xcite .",
    "basal dynamics and elasticity are also likely to influence the amplitude saturation , and substantial further research is still needed to infer whether sliding - controlled regulation is the responsible mechanism behind flagellar wave generation .",
    "+ principal component analysis allowed us to reduce the nonlinear dynamics of the flagellum in a two - dimensional shape space , regarding the flagellum as a single - frequency biological oscillator @xcite .",
    "notice that a two - dimensional description would not hold for multifrequency oscillations , where an additional dimension is required @xcite .",
    "interestingly , we found that as activity increases , the characteristic wavenumber of the system slightly decreases .",
    "thus , dynein activity has an opposite effect on wavenumber selection when compared with the medium viscosity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]d , inset ) .",
    "we also showed that the steady state amplitude is selected by the fastest growing mode under the influence of competing unstable modes , provided that the initial mode amplitudes are sufficiently small .",
    "+ an important aspect which is not studied explicitly in this work is the direction of wave propagation . for simplicity , we used clamped boundary conditions at the head which are known to induce travelling waves which propagate from tip to base in the sliding - controlled model @xcite .",
    "it is beyond the scope of our study to assess the effects of different boundary conditions and the role of basal compliance at the head of the flagellum , which are known to crucially affect wave propagation @xcite .",
    "the present work also restricts to the case of small curvatures ; however , the full nonlinear equations including the presence of tension could in principle be numerically solved as in previous studies @xcite ( see supplementary text ) .",
    "finally , real flagella is subject to chemical noise due to the stochastic binding and unbinding of dynein motors .",
    "recent studies have provided insights on this problem by investigating a noisy oscillator driven by molecular motors . however ,",
    "their approach was not spatially extended @xcite .",
    "our approach could be suitably extended to include chemical noise in the system through eq .",
    "[ eq10 ] by considering a chemical langevin equation for the bound dynein populations including multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "in particular , it can be easily deduced from our study that by considering a force - independent unbinding rate , fluctuations of bound motors around the base state have mean @xmath201 and variance @xmath202 , in agreement with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite where a different model was considered .",
    "+ the possibility to experimentally probe the activity of dyneins inside the axoneme is one of the most exciting future challenges in the study of cilia and flagella .",
