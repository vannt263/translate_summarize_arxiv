    "the distinction between markovian and non - markovian regimes has long been considered a basic one in the study of open system dynamics , i.e. , when the system of interest is in contact with an external environment . in qualitative terms",
    ", markovianity is typically associated with the lack of _ memory effects _",
    ", a situation which considerably simplifies the theoretical description and yet occurs with good approximation in a number of cases . assessing the ( non-)markovianity of an open dynamics is a well - understood problem in classical mechanics . in the quantum realm ",
    "quite differently  it is not @xcite . until recently ,",
    "markovianity has been almost ubiquitously identified with regimes where the open quantum dynamics is well - described by a master equation ( me ) of the kossakowski - lindblad form @xcite   lindbladian \" dynamics for brevity. the latter typically gives rise to purely exponential decays of quantities such as mean energy , po !",
    "pulations and coherences .",
    "a vast and variegated literature , indeed , has used and in some cases still uses the term  non - markovian \" as a synonym of non - lindbladian .    over the last few years , however , a considerable amount of work has been devoted to the refinement of the very notion of non - markovianity ( nm ) of a quantum dynamics , with the aim of providing its rigorous identification and quantification @xcite .",
    "several new definitions of nm have been proposed , each associated with a specific quantitative measure @xcite .",
    "a particularly intuitive one is the so called  blp \" measure @xcite , which identifies nm with the occurrence of _ quantum _ information ( qi ) back - flow between the system and environment ( i.e. , there exist times at which the latter is able to return qi to the former ) . to appreciate how these recent studies are affecting the pre - existing paradigm of nm ,",
    "suffice it to say that certain well - known integro - differential mes were shown to have zero blp measure @xcite , despite for a long time a me of this sort had been regarded as a typical nm process .",
    "the analysis of nm from this re !",
    "newed perspective has been recently applied to a number of systems such as atoms in lossy cavities @xcite , spin - boson models @xcite , spin chains @xcite and ultracold atoms @xcite . a major motivation to explore different physical scenarios is that studying the emergence of nm in different environmental models helps our understanding of nm itself , a concept whose physical meaning is currently under debate @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we contribute to these efforts by studying nm in the emission process of a quantum emitter or  atom \" in front of _ one _ mirror , a model that can be solved exactly under very general approximations @xcite .",
    "one of the strengths of the considered system as explained in more detail below is that the crucial parameters ruling the occurrence of nm effects have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "in particular , within the limits of validity of the model , our study clearly illustrates how the non - markovianity of the atomic emission is affected by imposing simple boundary conditions on the radiation field . in this spirit",
    "it is worth recalling that , even in the light of modern nm measures , spontaneous emission of a single atom ( in vacuum ) embodies the paradigmatic markovian open dynamics : the emitted radiation simply travels away from the atom , so that the latter has no chance to retrieve information about its past dynamics from the electromagn !",
    "etic field ( i.e. the environment ) .",
    "a typical way to establish information backflow in this scenario is to impose a geometrical confinement of the field , for example by means of a high - finesse cavity .",
    "the nm of an atom in a cavity is often analyzed by assuming an _ effective _ lorentzian - shaped spectral density ( sd ) centered at a cavity protected frequency @xcite , and in the strong coupling regime can result even in vacuum rabi oscillations @xcite , an indisputably non - markovian phenomenon .",
    "a well - known implementation of a cavity is a fabry - perot resonator , which features _ a pair of mirrors_. there is no fundamental reason , yet , that prevents nm from taking place even with _ only one _ mirror .",
    "rather , in this context , introducing a single mirror in front of an atom appears to be the _ minimum _ geometrical confinement enabling the emergence of nm .",
    "thus , from this viewpoint a simple atom - mirror setup  otherwise termed an _ atom in a half - cavity _  can be regarded as a more fundamental system than a cavity to clarify how nm arises in the interaction of matter and geometrically confined light .",
    "specifically , we will focus on a two - level atom where the emitted radiation is constrained to travel along a semi - infinite one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide featuring a linear photonic dispersion relation .",
    "the finite end of the waveguide behaves as a perfect mirror , forcing part of the emitted light to return to the atom ; one may expect such _ feedback _ mechanism to allow for information backflow , hence nm .",
    "also , the finite time taken by a carrier photon to perform a round trip between atom and mirror ( _ time delay _",
    "@xmath0 ) should reasonably behave as an environmental memory time and hence as a key parameter to the occurrence of nm .",
    "the restriction to 1d geometry , while certainly a theoretical convenience , also ensures that a significant fraction of emitted light must return to the atom , which intuitively should enhance interference phenomena .",
    "these are ruled by the interplay between a _ phase _",
    "parameter @xmath1 , related to the atom - mirror optical path for a carrier photon , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath2 , that is , the time delay rescaled by the spontaneous emission rate @xmath3 .",
    "we wonder if and how such interference affects nm .",
    "we find it remarkable that the occurrence of nm can be investigated as a function of quantities with a clear physical interpretation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ open - dyn ] , we briefly review the model under investigation , focussing the open system dynamics that the atom undergoes when it emits in vacuum . in section [ nm - measure ] , we tackle the problem of employing a reliable criterion to witness nm in the system under study and select a valid nm measure for a rigorous quantification .",
    "we explain our choice to use the measure in ref .",
    "the central findings of this work are then presented in section [ central ] , where we analize the occurrence of nm effects as a function of the two parameters @xmath2 and @xmath1 mentioned above .",
    "special emphasis is given to the characterization of the threshold separating the markovian and non - markovian regions in the corresponding parameters space .",
    "we summarize our results and deliver some final comments in section [ concl ] .",

    "[ fig1 ] ]    the model we consider [ see fig .  1(a ) ] comprises a semi - infinite 1d photonic waveguide lying along the positive @xmath5-axis , containing a two - level quantum emitter ( atom ) placed at @xmath4 .",
    "the waveguide termination at @xmath6 is assumed to behave as a perfect mirror , imposing a hard - wall boundary condition on the field .",
    "several experimental implementations of the model are possible , involving a variety of quantum emitters embedded in several types of waveguides ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",

    "1(b ) , a free - space implementation is viable as well along the lines of ref .",
    "this makes use of a trapped ion , a standard mirror and a pair of high - numerical - aperture lenses .",
    "we remark that the 1d geometry is an idealization , and that the model could be refined by assuming the presence of external field modes into which the atom can decay @xcite .",
    "the ground and excited states of the atom are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , with energy separation @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the waveguide supports a continuum of electromagnetic modes , each with associated wave vector @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that a linear dispersion relation of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the photon group velocity and @xmath15 the carrier wave vector ( @xmath16 ) , is valid for a sufficiently broad band of modes around the atomic frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the atom s emission process was first studied in the 80s @xcite and , more recently , revisited and extended in refs .  @xcite . for the purposes of this work",
    ", it will be sufficient to recall the essential results allowing us to describe the reduced dynamics of the atom ( the field being initially in the vacuum state ) . for more details",

    "is that the linearization of the waveguide dispersion relation has to be valid in a band of frequencies broader than the atomic width @xmath3 and the inverse of the delay time @xmath31 ( see appendix a ) .",

    "note that the first term on the righthand side is associated with standard spontaneous emission . instead",
    ", the feedback introduced by the presence of the mirror is represented by the second term .",
    "this is proportional to @xmath33 meaning that , as expected , the atom undergoes standard spontaneous emission up to time @xmath34 .",
    "after this , light emitted in the past can interfere with radiation emitted in the present as well as interact with the atomic dipole moment ( i.e. , excitation amplitude ) .",
    "such interference process is witnessed by the phase factor @xmath35 and , in general , can dramatically affect the dynamics . in particular , it can inhibit the full de - excitation of the atom for @xmath36 ( @xmath37 integer ) , and in the regime @xmath32 it essentially prevents spontaneous emission altogether @xcite .",
    "an atom in a half - cavity is conveniently described through a quantum electrodynamics ( qed)-like approach under the usual rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , where the mirror enforces a boundary condition on the field . here",
    "we review some essential features of this model @xcite . denoting the annihilation ( creation ) bosonic operator of the waveguide field as @xmath107 ( @xmath108 )",
    ", the hamiltonian reads @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 stands for a cut - off wave vector and @xmath3 is the atomic spontaneous emission rate ( if the waveguide were infinite ) . in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , note that the coupling strength between the atom and the @xmath11th mode is @xmath112 , which stems from the constraint that the field vanishes at the mirror location @xmath113 ( hard - wall boundary condition ) .",
    "as specified in the main text , we are concerned with the reduced dynamics of the atom when the field is initially in the vacuum state @xmath114 .",
    "the total number of excitations is conserved since @xmath115{\\!=\\!}0 $ ] . note that the state @xmath116 does not evolve in time since it is an eigenstate of @xmath117 ( with zero eigenvalue ) . on the other hand",

    ", one makes use of the the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath122 , which results in a system of differential equations for @xmath24 and @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "two approximations are then made .",
    "( i ) it is assumed that the photon dispersion relation can be linearized as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the photon group velocity and @xmath15 is the wave vector corresponding to the atomic frequency , i.e. , @xmath125 .",
    "( ii ) the integral bounds are approximated as @xmath126 .",
    "these routine approximations @xcite , together with the rwa mentioned earlier , rely on the fact that only a narrow range of wave vectors around @xmath127 is expected to give a significant contribution to the dynamics .",
    "since the range ! of frequencies involved in the the atomic dynamics is ruled by the two parameters @xmath3 and @xmath0 , we deduce that the linearization of the waveguide dispersion relation is a good approximation in a band of frequencies broader than the atomic width @xmath3 as well as the inverse of the delay time @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , a further requirement is that the time delay @xmath0 should be much larger than the optical period @xmath128 , in order to avoid the breakdown of the rwa . in specific implementations of the model",
    ", these assumptions have to be checked _ a posteriory",
    "_ for consistency .",
    "once we set in a rotating reference frame such that @xmath129 and the field variables are expressed in terms of the atomic excitation amplitude@xcite , we end up with eq .   in the main text .",

    "we adopt the recently introduced geometric measure of nm @xcite . in general , this is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the volume of accessible states of the open system @xmath46 under study at time @xmath22 .",

    "we stress , however , that this is an arbitrary choice since , as anticipated , the qualitative predictions on nm are mostly measure - independent for the present dynamics .",

    "( [ n1 ] ) is the maximum possible or , instead , @xmath49 can be higher at lower values of @xmath2 ( due to interference effects , we may expect that the answer to this question depends on the phase @xmath1 ) . the regime of intermediate values of @xmath2 features quite a rich physics with a variety of possible behaviors , as can be seen from figs .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) for two different values of @xmath2 .    although exact , the solution ( [ eps ] ) of eq .  ( [ dde ] )",
    "is unfortunately complicated enough to prevent either @xmath49 or even the mere nm condition ( [ criterion ] ) from being worked out in a compact analytical form .",
    "we have therefore carried out a numerical computation of @xmath49 by tabulating @xmath48 at the nodes of a time - axis mesh .",
    "next , it was checked that the outcomes were stable with respect to the number of mesh points and the length of the overall simulated interval .",
    "3 shows a contour plot of @xmath49 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the considered range of the phase @xmath1 is @xmath76 $ ] due to the periodicity of the exponential . to begin our analysis of fig .  3",
    ", we first observe that , as expected , @xmath77 if @xmath78 @xcite ( regime of negligible @xmath2 , see subsection [ gammatausmall ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath2 grows ( regime of very large @xmath2 ) @xmath49 converges to @xmath79 regardless of @xmath1 , in line with the discussion related to eq .",
    "( [ n1 ] ) . as predicted ,",
    "such asymptotic value is independent of @xmath1 , which is witnessed by the fact that as @xmath2 grows the profile of @xmath49 becomes more and more flat with respect to @xmath1 . for a set value of @xmath2",
    ", the maximum of @xmath49 is numerically found at @xmath36 and its minimum at @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is an integer nu ! mber .",
    "such values of the phase shift correspond to the atom sitting at a _",
    "node _ and _ antinode _ , respectively , of the field mode of wave vector @xmath15 , that is , the mode resonant with the atomic transition [ the sine function in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , for this particular mode , can be recast as @xmath82 .",
    "this might appear as counter - intuitive since nm is usually expected to increase with the effective atom - field coupling , which in turn grows with the field amplitude at the atom s location .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that considerations about nm are typically model - dependent . for our system , a reasonable interpretation of these results",
    "can be given as follows .",
    "we note that the parameter @xmath1 encodes crucial information about the interference properties of the carrier wave - vector @xmath15 , around which we expect to find most of the emitted radiation .",
    "more specifically , a carrier photon acquires a phase @xmath83 in a round trip between atom and mirror ( the term @xmath30 due to mirror reflection ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath36 , the reflected field will return to the atom with an overall phase @xmath30 relative to the radiation that has been emitted towards the free end of the waveguide , resulting in destructive interference between the two .",
    "this effectively slows down the emission process , so that part of the emitted light can be expected to remain in the atom - mirror interspace for a significant time , which favours the occurrence of multiple re - absorptions [ these bring about nm in virtue of eq .",
    "( [ criterion ] ) ] .",
    "setting instead @xmath65 ( antinode ) , the interference between the reflected field and the freshly emitted one becomes constructive , thus enhancing the emission of radiation in the direction opposite the mirror .",
    "obviously the latter is unable to re - excite the atom , which results in a reduced nm compared to the former situation .",
    "the difference between the two regimes , hence the gap between the maximum and minimum of @xmath49 ( see fig .  3 ) , becomes negligible as @xmath2 becomes very lar !",
    "this can be understood by noting that , in such regime , the photon coming back from the mirror does not encounter any field with which it can interfere ( as the atom will have decayed to the ground state well before a round - trip time ) .",
    "equivalently , one might explain this by interpreting @xmath66 as the regime in which the  bandwidth \" @xmath3 is large , compared to the characteristic frequency @xmath84 : as @xmath3 is increased the fraction of light at the carrier wave vector @xmath15 thus becomes less dominant in determining the behaviour of the emitted light .      a close inspection of fig .  3 reveals the existence of a finite region on the @xmath1-@xmath2 plane within which the system exhibits a _",
    "markovian _ behavior , i.e. , vanishing @xmath49 .",
    "the shape of such markovianity region can be better appreciated in fig .  4 . for fixed @xmath1 , one can find a finite _ threshold _ with respect to @xmath2 separating the markovian and non - markovian regime .",
    "the height of such threshold ranges from @xmath86 ( for @xmath87 to over @xmath88 ( for @xmath58 ) .",
    "this indicates that , aside from the special point @xmath57 , for fixed @xmath3 , @xmath15 and @xmath14 the mirror needs to lie far enough from the atom in order for the system to exhibit nm . hence ,",
    "when @xmath2 grows from zero the system in general does not enter suddenly the nm region .",
    "loosely speaking , the system can behave in a memoryless fashion even well beyond the linbladian regime occurring for @xmath50 .",
    "the appearance of n !",
    "m thresholds in parameter space has been demonstrated in a number of systems such as in ref .",
    "interestingly , fig .  4 shows the occurrence of thresholds even with respect to the phase shift @xmath1 for a fixed value @xmath2 ( provided that this is lower than the threshold maximum ) .",
    "owing to the discussed periodicity in @xmath1 , this means that a continuous increase of @xmath1 makes the system cross in succession interspersed regions of markovian and non - markovian behavior .",
    "interestingly , this can be achieved in practice by continuously detuning the atom s frequency ( which is routinely attained through local fields ) since this is easily seen to be equivalent to a change in @xmath1 @xcite ( provided that the group velocity does not vary significantly in the explored frequency range ) .",
    "both in terms of maximum amount of nm and threshold height , our results show that the most non - markovian effects are found for a phase @xmath36 .",
    "as anticipated , it can be demonstrated @xcite that such value of @xmath1 enables the formation of an atom - photon _ bound state _ in the atom - mirror interspace .",
    "this is in line with recent works pointing out the connection between nm and bound system - bath states @xcite . in our specific system , it can be shown @xcite that an atom - photon bound state of energy @xmath9 ( hence it is a bound state _ in the continuum _",
    "@xcite ) is formed for @xmath36 between the atom and mirror ( i.e. , the corresponding photon density is identically zero for @xmath89 ) . as a consequence , when @xmath36 part of the atomic excitation remains trapped according to @xcite @xmath90 which corresponds to the overlap between the atom s excited state and such bound state .",
    "note that the trapping is reduced for increasing @xmath2 . on the other hand , from eq .",
    "( [ dde ] ) , @xmath91 which is lower than @xmath92 for any @xmath93 .",
    "hence , @xmath40 must necessarily increase at some time , which in the light of criterion ( [ criterion ] ) proves that the system is always non - markovian at this special value of the phase .    adopting a standard viewpoint in the theory of open quantum systems , we further observe that the phase @xmath1 determines the position of the atomic frequency with respect to the spectral density ( sd ) of the  photonic bath \" . for our model ,",
    "the spectral density is simply proportional to the square of the atom - photon coupling @xcite , and can be expressed as @xmath94 where we have defined the atom - photon detuning @xmath95 and we used the identity @xmath96 .",
    "this leads to interpreting @xmath0 as the parameter ruling the width of the sd : as @xmath0 grows , @xmath97 exhibits an increasingly oscillatory behaviour . in the limit @xmath98 and for fixed @xmath3 ,",
    "the sd becomes flat which results in a lindbladian dynamics ( see subsection [ gammatausmall ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time , the behaviour of @xmath97 around resonance is decided by @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , such discussion allows for a natural comparison between our atomic dynamics in a single - mirror setup and that occurring in a lossy cavity featuring a lorentzian sd . in the latter case ,",
    "the dynamics is characterized by two dimensionless parameters : these are @xmath99 , where @xmath100 measures the sd s width , @xmath3 being again the spontaneous emission rate in the  flat spectrum \" limit , and @xmath101 , with @xmath102 the atomic detuning with respect to the cavity protected frequency ( at which the maximum of the sd occurs ) . significantly ,",
    "despite major differences between the two systems , also the lossy cavity model exhibits nm thresholds with respect to both the width parameter and detuning @xcite .",
    "while a lossy cavity has long been considered the paradigmatic system in which to investigate the emergence of nm effects , we find it interesting that a similarly rich structure can occur even with a single mirror .",
    "we also observe that the strength of nm effects , as quantified by eq .",
    "( [ meas ] ) , appears comparable in the two models , if the lorentzian sd is taken in the  bad cavity limit \" @xmath103 .",
    "this can be appreciated by comparing fig .  3 and the results in ref .",
    "@xcite . a significant difference between the two models , however , is the fact that the single - mirror setup features an absolute maximum @xmath104 as a function of the model parameters , wh !",
    "ile for the lossy cavity @xmath105 can be made arbitrarily large by increasing the cavity quality factor .",
    "we have studied the occurrence of nm in the emission process of an atom coupled to a one - dimensional field , in the presence of a single mirror which imposes a hard - wall boundary condition on the latter . in general , the resulting open dynamics of the atom exhibits a non - exponential behaviour with a rich structure . adopting the non - divisibility of time evolution as the chosen definition of nm , and a corresponding nm quantifier proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have studied the strength of nm effects in our system as a function of the two effective parameters characterizing the model : the rescaled round - trip time @xmath2 and the phase @xmath1 . while analytical results have been provided in the limiting cases @xmath32 and @xmath66 , a numerical approach has been adopted for the intermediate regime @xmath106 .",
    "remarkably , a finite region in parameter space can be identified where no nm occurs , its boundary defining a nm threshold . for any fixed value of @xmath2",
    ", the maximum nm is found at @xmath36 , where a bound atom - photon state is formed .",
    "interestingly , finite markovian thresholds occur with respect to both the sd width parameter and atomic detuning , a structure which is also exhibited in the open dynamics of an atom in a lossy cavity with lorentzian spectral density .",
    "a deeper and more rigorous insight into the relationship between the nm effects in such cavity model and those occurring in the half - cavity treated here can be gained by introducing a second imperfect mirror in the latter model .",
    "the lossy cavity dynamics is then obtained in the limit of negligible time delay !",
    "s @xcite ( a cavity model featuring non - null time delays has been investigated in ref .",
    "the analysis of nm for such a two - mirror model , which can be regarded as an _ ab initio _  instead of phenomenological  description of a lossy cavity , is currently under investigation @xcite ."
