    "the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction has been studied for more than 50 years , but it is still not fully understood . the research program proposed by japanese physicists around 1950 @xcite and based on the idea that the outer part of the interaction is due to mesonic exchanges proved to be very successful .",
    "quite generally , the spatial features of a given process are determined by the mass exchanged in the @xmath0-channel and lighter systems correspond to longer interaction ranges .",
    "the lightest nn exchange , associated with the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) became a consensus in the sixties , giving rise to a generation of models in which waves with @xmath1 were treated theoretically @xcite .",
    "the second layer of the interaction is much more complex and was studied in the following two decades , by means of a detailed treatment of the two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) @xcite .",
    "this process depends on an intermediate pion - nucleon ( @xmath2n ) scattering amplitude and reflects strongly its dynamical content .    in the present decade ,",
    "most of the research work on the nn potential was aimed at constructing the tpep in the framework of chiral symmetry .",
    "this symmetry was developed around 1960 , for systems in which pions and nucleons were considered as elementary .",
    "nowadays one believes qcd to be the basic theory of strong interactions and , accordingly , that pions and nucleons are made of light quarks , interacting by means of gluon exchanges .",
    "as the qcd lagrangian predicts that gluons can interact among themselves , calculations at low and intermediate energies are very difficult .",
    "the usual strategy for overcoming this problem consists in working with effective theories that treat pions and nucleons as elementary and include , as much as possible , the main features of the basic theory .",
    "the fact that the masses of the u and d quarks are close to each other and very small in the hadronic scale means that qcd is approximately invariant under the chiral group su(2)@xmath3su(2 ) .",
    "one therefore requires the effective theories to possess approximate chiral symmetry , besides the usual poincar invariance .    in low energy processes , chiral symmetry",
    "is realized in the nambu - goldstone mode and the vacuum is filled with a condensate , that allows the excitations of massless collective states , identified with the pions .",
    "the breaking of the symmetry , due to the quark masses at the fundamental level , is associated with the small pion masses in the effective theories .",
    "chiral symmetry is very important in the theoretical treatment of two - pion exchange because it constrains the intermediate @xmath2n amplitude . at low and intermediate energies",
    "it is given by a nucleon pole contribution , superimposed to a smooth background @xcite .",
    "the symmetry is responsible for large cancellations within the nucleon sector that , at once , settle the scale of the problem and amplify the role of the background .",
    "the latter is very important , since the chiral nucleon sector in isolation does not suffice for explaining @xmath4n experimental data .",
    "the construction of the tpep in the framework of chiral dynamics motivated most of the research of this decade , beginning with the work of ordez and van kolck @xcite , who considered a system containing just pions and nucleons .",
    "several works followed , dealing with complementary aspects of the problem @xcite and nowadays this part of the nn interaction is well understood .",
    "predictions for nn observables produced by just the opep and the chiral tpep , assumed to represent the full interaction for distances larger than 2 fm , were calculated and shown to agree well with experiment @xcite .",
    "therefore the effort based on chiral symmetry led to an important refinement of outer part of this interaction and brought theoretical constraints to waves with @xmath5 .    in the case of the nn interaction",
    ", it is important to note that the importance of chiral symmetry depends strongly on the process one is considering . in the case of the opep , for instance , it is completely irrelevant , for predictions from chiral @xmath4n lagrangians coincide with those arising from interactions without any symmetry .",
    "all lagrangians , symmetric and non - symmetric , produce exactly the same basic pion - nucleon vertex , showing that chiral symmetry is compatible with and , at the same time , irrelevant for the opep @xcite . in the case of the tpep , on the other hand , the symmetry is crucial .",
    "it produces internal cancellations in the intermediate @xmath4n amplitude which yield a potential that vanishes in the chiral limit .    to our knowledge ,",
    "only contributions due to the exchanges of one and two pions have been so far studied in the framework of chiral symmetry . in order to extend this picture , here we study the component of the nn potential due to the exchange of three uncorrelated pions .",
    "this system has a mass around 450 mev and its effects should be longer than those of the vector mesons usually present in one - boson exchange potentials .",
    "the basic interaction is closely related to the amplitude for the process @xmath2n@xmath6n .",
    "hence , we review briefly the main features of this reaction in sect.ii and calculate the potential in sect.iii .",
    "the nn interaction mediated by the exchange of three uncorrelated pions is derived from @xmath7 , the amplitude for the process @xmath8 .",
    "this amplitude is given by the diagrams of fig.1 and written as the sum of @xmath9 , representing the class of processes with a pion pole in the @xmath0-channel , and a remainder , denoted by @xmath10 , whose dynamical content is indicated in fig.1 . in the framework of chiral symmetry ,",
    "this last amplitude is given by a basic family of diagrams , involving only pions and nucleons , supplemented by other processes , containing deltas , rhos , omega and the @xmath11 @xmath12-term .",
    "there are many alternative ways of implementing chiral symmetry .",
    "in particular , the subset of diagrams in the pure pion - nucleon sector , corresponding to the minimal realization of chiral symmetry in this problem , may be evaluated by means of non - linear lagrangians with @xmath2n couplings that may be either pseudovector ( pv ) os pseudoscalar ( ps ) . denoting the pion field by @xmath13 , and defining @xmath14 , we have    _ pv & = & l_+ |i _ + i - m+ |__5 - , [ 2.1 ] + l_ps & = & l_+ |nin -g |n(f+i_5)n , [ 2.2 ]    where    _ = ( f f+ ) + f_^2 f .

    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the nucleon fields with non - linear and linear transformation properties , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the pion and nucleon masses and @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively the pion decay , the @xmath2n coupling and the axial decay constants .",
    "it is important to stress that these lagrangians , in spite of their different aspects , have the same dynamical content and physical results do not depend on the particular version one adopts , as demonstrated on general grounds @xcite .",
    "the pion production amplitude has the general form    it_cba= _ bc_a ( a^+|a ) + _ ac_b(b^+|b ) + _",

    "the signature of chiral symmetry are the contact interactions due to the function @xmath33 in eq.([2.2 ] ) , which give rise to the terms proportional to @xmath34 in eq.([2.10 ] ) .    in order to estimate the accuracy of the pion - production amplitude derived from eq.([2.1 ] ) , we consider the contributions to the amplitudes @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are written in terms of the variables    d_1^&= & , [ 2.12 ] +     and    d_2^&= & - , [ 2.14 ] +    & - & . 2 1-+- , [ 2.15 ]    where @xmath35/[2 ( m\\!+\\!2\\m)]$ ] and @xmath36 . expanding these amplitudes in powers of @xmath37 , one has    d_1 & = & [ d_1^]+[|d_1 ] 3 + + -2 - 2 + , 2.16 +   + d_2 & = & [ d_2^]+[|d_2 ] - 3 + + - 4 + .",
    "2.17    the results for the full amplitudes at threshold , namely @xmath38 and @xmath39 , coincide with those obtained in the framework of chiral perturbation theory @xcite . in order to asses the role of chiral symmetry in this problem we note that a lagrangian without any symmetry , containing just a ps @xmath2n interaction , would give rise to the same pion - pole contribution and an amplitude @xmath26 corresponding to just the six first terms in eq.([2.10 ] ) , which involve two nucleon propagators .",
    "therefore the full elimination of chiral symmetry would yield @xmath40 and @xmath41 , indicating that chiral symmetry does play a role in this problem . on the other hand , that this role is not as large as in the case of @xmath2n@xmath42n , where the same procedure would change one of the scattering lenghts by a factor of 200 .",
