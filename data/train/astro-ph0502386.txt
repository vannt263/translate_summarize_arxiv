    "while the milky way galaxy gives us a much better view of the individual component stars than any other galaxy , it is difficult to view our galaxy as an assembled whole .",
    "new surveys such as 2mass and sdss @xcite , are allowing us to start assembling the global picture one star at a time .",
    "other surveys that are in progress such as rave , gaia , pan - starrs , ukidss / vista , and sdss ii / segue will extend our view of the stars not only in positional information but also in kinematic information for a large number of galactic stars .",
    "sdss color - magnitude hess diagrams such as figure 11 of @xcite show two populations with distinct turnoffs ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the brighter population has a turnoff at @xmath4 and is associated with the thick disk .",
    "the fainter population has a turnoff at @xmath5 , and is associated with the spheroid .",
    "1 shows the color - magnitude selection boxes for thick disk , spheroid , and faint spheroid data samples selected from sdss - dr3 .",
    "2 shows the number counts of spheroid stars as a function of position in the galaxy from sdss dr3 .",
    "where there are no counts , we have no data .",
    "note that the number counts do not appear to be symmetric about the galactic center .",
    "3 shows this numerically , by plotting star counts along several lines of constant galactic latitude .",
    "there are more spheroid stars in quadrant iv than in quadrant i , and the minimum is at @xmath2 rather than @xmath1 , as we would have expected .",
    "4 shows that the spheroid number counts are not significantly asymmetric about the galactic equator .",
    "5 shows the star counts for the thick disk selection for all of dr3 , while fig .",
    "6 shows quantitatively that the thick disk is symmetric about @xmath6 .",
    "fig . 7 is a cartoon , looking down on the galactic plane , depicting the star counts that would be observed at a constant height above or below the galactic plane for a sample triaxial spheroid .",
    "this type of model can explain a minimum in quadrant ii , and a maximum in quadrant iv for samples of stars close to the sun .",
    "it predicts that the maximum would switch to quadrant i for stars more distant than the distance from the sun to the galactic center .",
    "8 shows the star counts for a more distant sample of spheroid stars , and fig .",
    "9 shows star counts through this figure at constant galactic latitude .",
    "there is some evidence that the peak star counts shifts to quadrant i for this more distant sample , though the presence of the sagittarius stream makes the interpretation problematic .",
    "the spheroid population may be triaxial with a major axis oriented @xmath3 from the line of sight from the sun to the galactic center .",
    "this is approximately perpendicular to the galactic bar .",
    "this is surprising since one typically expects bars to have an angular pattern speed larger than could be sustained in the spheroid , but the possible connection should be examined .",
    "significant substructure is observed in the spheroid population with main sequence turnoffs at apparent magnitudes of @xmath7 and fainter .",
    "even the gaia mission will not reach faint enough or distant enough to study the part of the spheroid where we see the most substructure .",
    "thus , the need for newer and better astrometry will be required for the indefinite future ."
