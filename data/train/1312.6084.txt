    "<S> as already seen , e - e scattering increases the electron current ( red squares ) and decreases the hole current ( green diamonds ) . for large fermi energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 the rate of change approaches zero for the electron current and remains finite for the hole current , reflecting the different behavior of the phase space for scattering in the two cases [ see figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relax1](b ) and ( c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the e - e scattering also relaxes the total current ( blue circles ) but there are substantial cancellations between the electron and hole contributions . to quantify these cancellations </S>",
    "<S> , we analytically explore the asymptotic behavior of eq .   for large excitation energies and small fermi energy , i.e. , for the limit @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> here , we focus on the results . details of the calculations can be found in @xcite .    for the electron current , we only need to consider the scattering process illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relax1](b ) because interband processes , i.e. , @xmath76 , are collinear and do not change the current , as shown above by the geometric argument . for the hole </S>",
    "<S> , we have to consider scattering processes like the one illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : relax1](c ) . the hole can recombine with an electron in the valence band , exciting an electron from the conduction band above the fermi energy , i.e. , @xmath77 , or the hole can recombine with an electron in the conduction band , exciting an electron from the valence band above the fermi energy , i.e. , @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> other allowed processes will be collinear . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the asymptotic behavior of the rate of change of the electron and hole currents is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 @xcite , @xmath81 stands for the electron and hole current respectively , and @xmath82 is the initial current of magnitude @xmath83 of the photoexcited carrier . </S>",
    "<S> this result has several interesting aspects . </S>",
    "<S> first , the time scale on which the initial current changes is independent of the large initial excitation energy @xmath11 of the photoexcited carrier and instead depends on the fermi energy only . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the fact that the typical energy transfer in the relevant e - e collisions is of the order of the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , to this order the rates of change of electron and hole currents differ only in their sign and thus cancel exactly . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rate of change of the total current of the photoexcited electron - hole pair is indeed much smaller and must scale with a higher power of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xcite @xmath84 the relaxation of the total current is suppressed for small @xmath12 and even vanishes in the limit @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : currderiv ] shows the rate of change of the total current for small @xmath12 determined by numerically integrating eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( blue circles ) , and the asymptotic behavior given by eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( red solid line ) .    </S>",
    "<S> these asymptotic behaviors of the total current and the individual electron and hole currents can be traced back to distinct scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> the amplification and relaxation of the individual currents are governed by scattering processes with small energy transfers of the order of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the total current the contributions with small energy transfer cancel exactly to the order considered and the result in eq </S>",
    "<S> .   arises solely from scattering processes with large energy transfers of the order of @xmath11 . specifically , the relaxation of the total current is dominated by the interband hole process , @xmath78 , where the hole recombines with an electron from the conduction band while exciting an electron from the valence band to empty states in the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the predominance of scattering events with large energy transfers of the order of @xmath11 also explains why the relaxation vanishes in the limit of @xmath86 .     and the asymptotic behavior @xmath87 given by eq .   </S>",

    "<S> inset : rates of change of the electron ( red squares ) , hole ( green diamonds ) , and total ( blue circles ) currents . </S>",
    "<S> parameters as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : meancurrkf ] . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation of the total current is strongly suppressed due to cancellations between the electron and hole contributions . </S>",
    "<S> results for @xmath51 follow by electron - hole symmetry.,width=321 ]    _ conclusion._motivated by photocurrent measurements on various dirac systems , we investigated the interaction - induced relaxation of photocurrents in clean dirac systems and uncovered a surprising effect : for a single excited electron , the current actually increases upon scattering with the electrons in the fermi sea , as long as the chemical potential is above the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> even for a single collision , this increase is substantial for realistic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since high - energy electrons decay via a cascade of e - e collisions , the current increase can be further amplified by an additional factor up to @xmath88 , as the typical energy loss per collision is of the order of the fermi energy @xcite . while the relaxation cascade underlying this argument has been predicted theoretically , the experimental situation remains inconclusive @xcite , possibly due to competing optical - phonon collisions or a large radiation intensity which produces a high density of photoelectrons and phonons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the amplification effect may be most pronounced for excited electrons with energies below optical - phonon frequencies ( @xmath89  mev for graphene ) and for low - intensity irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> this current amplification has important implications for photocurrents where it results in a substantial suppression of the current - relaxation rate of photoexcited electron - hole pairs , but might also be observable more directly in other types of experiments . </S>",
    "<S> most promising may be time - resolved measurements of photocurrents as recently performed on graphene @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one might also expect a strong non - linear signature in iv characteristics , since high energy electrons produce a jet of induced current . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason , the current amplification might enhance the photoconductivity ( electron conductivity in the presence of light ) , with the effect increasing with the frequency of the irradiating light . </S>",
    "<S> we intend to pursue a quantitative analysis of such effects in future work .    _ </S>",
