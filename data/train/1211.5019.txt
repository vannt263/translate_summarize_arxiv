    "bidirectional transport along mts involves the opposing motor molecules kinesin and dynein where kinesin takes cargos to the plus ends of mts and dynein takes the cargo to the minus - ends @xcite .",
    "numerous theoretical studies attempt to describe motility behaviour of cargos along a single mt or a network of mts , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "one of the simplest and best studied models is the _ asymmetric simple exclusion process _ ( asep ) defined on a single track ; see review  @xcite and references therein .",
    "extended asep models for bidirectional transport have made various assumptions to avoid collisions between opposite - directed particles .",
    "one is assuming that particles are binding and unbinding to / from tracks @xcite .",
    "another is assuming that the exclusion principle only applies to particles moving in the same direction and presence of a motor in the opposite direction modifies the rate at which motors enter into the site @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a high direction - change rate can avoid clusters due to collision @xcite .",
    "moreover , evans _",
    "et al _ introduced another possibility  @xcite to avoid collisions by allowing particle interchanges when they meet .",
    "juhsz introduced a two - lane asep @xcite with opposite - directed particles moving in separate lanes , thereby avoiding collisions between opposite - directed particles .",
    "the two - lane asep is equivalent to a two - species asep in some sense as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we introduced a multilane model in @xcite where particles can change protofilaments to avoid collisions , taking into account that a single mt consists of 13 protofilaments @xcite , each of which provides a potential track for motors .",
    "based on recent advances in live cell imaging techniques and the use of the fungal model system _ ustilago maydis _ , _ in vivo _ observation of dynein indicates that collision between opposite - directed motors rarely occurs @xcite .",
    "this allows adapting the two - lane model in @xcite to investigate the bidirectional transport of dynein motors on unipolar mts .",
    "the adapted two lane model together with a more sophisticated 13-lane model provides an explanation for the formation of dynein accumulation at mt plus - ends @xcite .",
    "this dynein accumulation at mt plus ends is suggested to prevent the cargo - early endosomes ( ees ) - falling off the mt @xcite",
    ". more recent work on _",
    "u. maydis _ has shown that the majority of the fungal cell contains antipolar mt bundles and that unipolar mts are restricted to the cell poles @xcite .",
    "early endosomes - the main cargo of dynein and kinesin-3 in hyphal cells @xcite , undergo long - distance bidirectional motility @xcite .",
    "interestingly , bidirectional long - distance motility of ees along the bipolar mts is mainly mediated ( dominated ) by kinesin-3 , whereas dynein is mediating retrograde motility of ees along the unipolar mt  @xcite .",
    "that paper also shows that ees travel over the entire length of the mt array and concludes that dynein and kinesin-3 cooperate and that cargo can hop between mts within the bundle @xcite .",
    "they also show that during the ee transport , dynein can detach from the cargo and the ee continues motility ( carried by kinesin-3 ) after a short pause .",
    "moreover , short pauses of ees before they continue the directed motility are observed at minus ends of mts by visualizing both minus ends of mts and ees @xcite .",
    "these suggest that ees may change mts at mt minus ends by altering their active motor types .",
    "hopping between tracks has been modelled for unidirectional traffic @xcite where a single track is followed by parallel tracks .",
    "the junction between single and parallel tracks allows particles on the single track to step into either of the parallel tracks . here",
    "we provide a new model that is based on our previous asep model but which includes this junction mechanism to describe bidirectional motility of cargo along an antipolar microtubule bundle . in our model , the lattice",
    "is composed of two mts that are coupled at microtubule minus ends and the arrangement of antipolar mt bundle gives unipolar and bipolar sections within the bundle .",
    "a detailed description of the model is given in section  [ sec_bipolarmodel ] . in section  [ sec_meanfield ] , we show that the distribution of particles along the lattice can exhibit a variety of phases depending on the parameters ; in subsection  [ sec_unipolar ] the phases in the unipolar section are analyzed while in the following subsections the phases in the entire system are considered . in particular , we show that even at a low overall density of particles , particles can accumulate at minus ends as well as at plus ends .",
    "moreover , we find a novel type of phase where density profiles of one type of particles can smoothly connect between low and high density .",
    "the density profiles for these different phases are well approximated by our mean field analysis . in section  [ sec_domin ] ,",
    "we consider how the mt switching rates @xmath4 affect the contribution of each type of motors to the transport of cargos .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_dis ] we discuss the biological relevance of this model .",
    "in this section , we introduce a simple discrete - lattice model with antipolar bundling of two mts ( we refer to each mt as a track ) .",
    "the bundle is presented by a lattice of length @xmath5 and contains two tracks of length @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively that overlap in a common section of length @xmath8 .",
    "the two plus ends of mts are located at two ends of the lattice and the other ends of two mts - the minus ends ( marking the end of the overlap ) - are in the middle ; see figure  [ fig_mt ] .",

    "considering the symmetric organization of the mt bundle shown in @xcite , we assume a symmetric lattice with @xmath12 in the following .    in the bundle , each track can support bidirectional transport of particles ( particularly ees here ) driven by opposite - directed motors ( kinesin-3 and dynein ) ; these particles are of two types : plus- and minus - type . plus",
    "- type particles are driven by plus - directed motors moving towards the plus end of the track whereas vice versa for minus - type particles .",
    "reversal of transport direction along each track can be realized by a brief `` tug - of - war '' event @xcite between counteracting motors on the particle . as rare collisions between opposite directed motion of ees in _",
    "u. maydis _ are observed @xcite which is similar to the dynein transport , we assume transport on each track in a particular direction is on a separate lane as in the two - lane model @xcite for convenience . thus , the lattice contains four lanes , each of which supports one direction and a single type of particles as illustrated in figure  [ fig_mt ]  ( b ) . as ees rarely fall off the mts @xcite in the _ u. maydis _ , we assume the transport system is closed , i.e. , there is no injection or exit of particles into / out of the lattice at two ends of each track .",
    "the closeness of the system leads a particle number conservation during the transport .",
    "particles once reach the end of tracks will wait until they change direction to continue the motility .",
    "further assumptions on the model are made on track switching of particles based on experiment observation of ee motility around minus ends in @xcite .",
    "an antipolar bundle of tracks enables particles to switch between tracks together with a change of type and without reversing direction .",

    "u. maydis _",
    "track switching may be possible inside the bipolar section as well as at the junction between bipolar and unipolar sections . for simplification , in this paper",
    "we assume track switching occurs when passing the junctions associated with minus ends of mts .",
    "due to the bipolar organization in the bundle , plus - type particles can only be on the same track when crossing the junctions .",
    "when a minus - type particle moves from a unipolar to a bipolar section , the minus end in the junction may enhance plus - directed motors on the particle to hop onto the other track , resulting in a change of the track on which the particle moves and the type of the particle .",
    "thus the minus ends can be viewed as `` obstacles '' for minus - type particles when attempting to step forward on the same track .",

    "the standard unidirectional asep on a single lane and the two - lane asep developed by juhsz @xcite share a common feature - particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this feature does not hold in the model we introduce here .",
    "however , by adapting the forward stepping rate of plus - type particles when crossing the junctions between sections ( i.e. , assuming there is inhomogeneity in stepping rates for plus - type particles at locations @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) , the model can still exhibit an exact particle - hole symmetry as explained below .",
    "note that particles are of two types , either moving towards or away from the plus ends on each track , we divide holes in the lattice into two types .",
    "minus - type holes refer to the holes in lanes for plus - type particles ( i.e. , the first and last lanes in the lattice shown in figure  [ fig_mt ] ) , as these holes move towards the minus end when the corresponding plus - type particles step forward ; plus - type holes refer to the holes in lanes for minus - type particles . an ( obstacle - induced ) track switching of minus - type particle from the unipolar to bipolar section indicates an ( end - induced ) track switching of a plus - type hole from the bipolar to unipolar section .",
    "similarly , a plus - type particle stepping from the bipolar to unipolar section on the same track indicates that a minus - type hole steps from the unipolar to bipolar section .",
    "therefore , if we let the forward rate for plus - type particles when crossing the junction at locations @xmath56 be @xmath57 and choose @xmath58 , then the system possess the particle - hole symmetry , i.e. , the system is identical under the exchange : @xmath59 the uncoupled system with homogeneous rates for plus - type particles ( i.e. , @xmath18 and @xmath60 ) is a special case with particle - hole symmetry . for small @xmath1 , the system with homogeneous rates for plus - type particles ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) still have some approximately `` symmetric '' behaviour",
    ". thus we focus on low and intermediate overall densities ; information for high overall densities can then be partly deduced from this `` symmetry '' .",

    "moreover , we re - express the densities on each track as @xmath66 and @xmath67 for plus- and minus - type particles respectively .",
    "the overall density of plus- and minus - type particles can then be re - expressed as @xmath68 in the spatial symmetric lattice with @xmath12 , we have @xmath69 and @xmath70 for these well defined regions .",
    "hence we only need to consider the distribution of particles on one track , say the first track , and can ignore the track index superscripts without ambiguity .",
    "as the lattice is composed of unipolar and bipolar sections , we consider these sections separately with appropriate boundary rates @xmath71 ; see figure  [ fig_eff_bc ] .",
    "the stochastic process in each section is an asep similar to that discussed in @xcite but with different boundary conditions . in both aseps in @xcite ,",
    "the mean - field approximation predicts the density profiles well for statistically stationary states . for the mean - field approximation",
    ", we ignore two - point correlations .",
    "the density profile in the steady state for plus- and minus - type particles in the unipolar / bipolar section of the lattice is then governed by the following equations ( ignoring the second derivative and second order of @xmath72 ) with appropriate boundary conditions ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath73 meanwhile , the unidirectional currents within each section are given by equations @xmath74 and the net current reads as @xmath75    taking the sum of equations in ( [ eq_pdesimple ] ) gives @xmath76 which gives a constant net current in the mean field approximation @xmath77 within each section in the steady state . a positive ( negative ) net current indicates a net current towards the plus ( minus ) end .",
    "the system we consider is closed , and so the unipolar sections are half closed , i.e. , no exit ( of plus - type particles ) and no injection ( of minus - type particles ) is possible at the plus ends .",
    "for the first track , the unipolar section in @xmath78 is closed at the right end , corresponding to the boundary rates @xmath79 , which give @xmath80 we assume the left end @xmath81 of the unipolar section is associated with injection / exit rates @xmath82 and @xmath83 . as discussed in  @xcite , the unipolar section has a zero net current due to the closed boundary at the right end .",
    "thus @xmath84 , leading to the density relation @xmath85 together with the ode  ( [ eq_pdesimple ] ) , we have two possible solutions - complementary density @xmath86 and equal density @xmath87",
    ". the equal density may appear in the bulk of the unipolar while the complementary density starts from the plus end and extends toward the interior of the unipolar section .    as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "for low injection and high exit rates , the constant in the equal density case reads as @xmath88 ; the density profile of plus - type particles exhibits a shock between equal density and complementary density regimes while the density of minus - type particles is continuous except near the left end .",
    "we refer this as an sl phase ; the first letter means for the plus - type particles while the second one for the minus - type particles ; s stands for shock while l stands for low ( less than a half ) . the shock location @xmath89",
    "is determined by matching @xmath90 . combining the complementary solution  ( [ eq_comp ] ) and equal density @xmath82 gives @xmath91 .",
    "a limit @xmath92 gives a boundary of this sl phase in the space @xmath93 .",
    "when the shock is driven out of the unipolar section , the plus - type particles are in high density ( over one half ) and minus - type particles are in low density ; we refer as an hl phase ; h stands for high density .",
    "the linear density profile of plus - type particles in the complementary density decreases from 1 at the plus end and propagates inside . when a lower bound of @xmath94 for plus - type particles in density is reached before @xmath95 is decreased to @xmath96 , the density of @xmath94 continues when @xmath95 is further decreased and the maximum unidirectional current occurs in the unipolar section .",
    "this is referred as an mm phase ( m stands for maximal unidirectional current , which is @xmath97 ) and only occurs when @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 . by particle - hole symmetry ,",
    "analogous to the sl phase , we have an hs phase where the equal density is over one half and minus - type particles experience a shock . in summary ,",
    "the phase diagrams of density profiles for the unipolar section with general left boundary conditions @xmath82 and @xmath83 are shown in figure  [ fig_phase_twolane ] for both @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in the coexistence line @xmath102",

    "the boundary rates in one section may depend on those in another section .",
    "in the uncoupled case ( @xmath33 ) , the stochastic process on each track is exactly the same as the two - lane asep discussed in @xcite assuming equal direction - change rates . also from the discussion of the unipolar section in section  [ sec_unipolar ]",
    ", we can see that the density profile on the first track consists of three segments in general ; an equal - density segment occurs in the middle and connects with the boundaries by complementary - density segments on its left and right sides which are continuous at @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .    for either @xmath1 or @xmath2 positive , the density profiles can exhibit a variety of phases even if the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath3 are fixed . in the following ,",
    "we show that a mean - field approximation with appropriate boundary conditions for both unipolar and bipolar sections agrees well with numerical simulations for a variety of density profiles .",
    "the density profiles in the unipolar are discussed in section  [ sec_unipolar ] , thus we focus on the bipolar section in order to understand the density profile along the entire lattice . in the generic case where @xmath113 , the net current in the bipolar section on a single track is not necessary zero . for a small net current @xmath114",

    "when both types of particles in the bipolar section are in low densities , they are dominated by the injection rates @xmath124 in  ( [ eq_bc_alpha ] ) and we approximate @xmath133 by @xmath131 .",

    "this leads to low densities for both types of particles in the bipolar section and we refer as an ll - sl phase for the entire system ; the two letters before the dash are for the bipolar section while the other two follow the dash are for the unipolar , e.g. , here ll stands for the phase in the bipolar while sl for the unipolar section .",

    "we call this phase with smooth connection between low and high density for one type of particles as an sc ( or a cs ) phase ( ignoring the existence of shocks for the type which has smooth connection in the bipolar section ) depending on which type of particles exhibits `` smooth connection '' ; the letter ` s ' stands for shock while the letter ` c ' stands for connection .",
    "whether the density of plus - type or minus - type particles smoothly connects low and high density is related to the sign of the net current @xmath114 ; a positive @xmath114 is associated with plus - type particles having smooth connection and vice versa .",

    "we discuss the contribution of each type of particles to the transport in terms of occupancy as well as current in our model .      for the transport in the entire bundle ,",
    "one way to quantify the dominance in occupancy is to estimate the fraction of plus - type particles in the entire bundle , @xmath174 where @xmath175 for a symmetric lattice @xmath12 . recall that @xmath3 is an overall density of particles in the bundle which is preserved during the transport and is considered as a parameter .",

    "in contrast to the standard unidirectional asep on a single lane ( where both the density and current are constant along the bulk of the lane ) , in our model , neither the density nor the directed current of each type of particles on a single track is constant ; see figure  [ fig_den_curr ] for examples .",
    "thus , we consider the average unidirectional current @xmath202 and define an overall current @xmath203 .",

    "however , if shocks form in the bipolar section , higher densities ( above one half ) can give a lower current ( seen from figure  [ fig_den_curr ]  ( right panel ) ) .",

    "this suggests that @xmath1 is more important than @xmath2 for the dominance .",
    "in this paper , we introduce an asep - type model to describe the bidirectional motility of particles on an oriented bundle of tracks . this aims to model the motion of cargos / motor complexes undergoing transport along an antipolar mt bundle within a cell .",
    "our model is certainly a great simplification of cell transport processes .",
    "it is parameterized by the particle turning rate @xmath0 ( the inverse of the run length ) , the overall density @xmath3 ( the proportion of sites that are occupied by particles ) and the obstacle / end - induced switching rates @xmath4 ( i.e. the rate at which particles switch mts at the junctions between the unipolar and bipolar sections ) .",
    "we use numerical simulations and mean - field approximation to investigate the dependence of the stationary density profiles within the bundle on these parameters .",
    "we observe that , as expected , the switching rates @xmath4 have a major effect on the distribution of particles along the bundle .",
    "although we have not fully explored the dependence of phases on parameters we highlight below a number of interesting features about the system . even for _ low _ overall density @xmath3 , particles ( cargo / motor complexes ) can queue to form accumulations at minus ends in addition to any plus - end queuing observed in simpler situations @xcite .",
    "the critical value of the end - induced switching rate @xmath2 above which shocks are formed at minus ends is investigated in section  [ sec_low ] . for _ intermediate _ overall density @xmath3 , we find a variety of phases , including a new `` smooth connection '' phase where in the limit , the density profile of one type of particle on a track smoothly passes through one half while the other type displays a shock .",
    "we discuss a variety of other phases and have investigated the role of the switching rates @xmath4 in determining which motor is dominant in the transport . for _ low _ overall densities , the obstacle - induced switching rate @xmath1 influence the fraction of particles of one type within the bipolar section in an approximately linear way . for _ high _ overall density @xmath3",
    ", our study shows that although the fraction of occupancy by different type particles does not vary much with rates @xmath4 , the fraction that actually contributes to the current ( i.e. , transport ) from different types may vary much more .",
    "our model is inspired by _ in vivo _",
    "experimental observations , although the model has been simplified in many ways as we now discuss . for example , it is probably that hopping between mts is not restricted to the ends of the bipolar section , but may occur throughout the bipolar section @xcite .",
    "this would allow more possibilities for transition events , and the possibility of plus - type particles ( in addition to minus - type particles ) switching mts .",
    "a switch in transport direction can result from hopping between mts and the activity of kinesin-3 alone or it could be a consequence of dynein binding to the cargo , which in case of ees was shown to override kinesin-3 activity @xcite .",
    "our model also assumes only two lanes in each motility track .",
    "moreover , it is known that numerous mts form a bundle @xcite , each consisting of 13 protofilaments @xcite .",
    "thus , many more tracks might support bidirectional motility of the cargo / motor complexes and allowing opposite - directed particles moving on the same protofilament will certainly give new effects such as increasing the jamming at mt plus ends , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the complex geometry of the bundle will also contribute to new effects of cooperative transport , already considered for unidirectional transport in @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding these simplifications , we suggest the model could be useful in a number of ways , especially when improved measurement of transition rates is possible in vivo , and we highlight some of these below :    1 .   for low overall density of particles , it is possible to have an accumulation of particles at minus ends of mts . as _ in vivo _",
    "experiments so far show no obvious accumulation of early endosome cargos throughout the entire cell @xcite , if this model is accurate then it suggests the end - induced switching rate @xmath2 must be high _ in vivo_. there are clearly other possible explanations due to features not included in the model such as a high turning rate of minus - directed organelles at minus ends ( which might be due to an accumulation of motors at the minus end taking dynein to plus ends ) could avoid such an accumulation of ees ; this would be a similar mechanism to that suggested in @xcite where an accumulation of dynein motors increases the turning rate of ees near plus - ends and so avoids accumulations of ees .",
    "2 .   for low overall density of cargos ,",
    "the fraction of occupancy can be used to show how the proportion of ees carried by kinesin-3 among all ees ( carried by either kinesin-3 or dynein ) varies with the parameters in section  [ sec_domin ] .",
    "these estimates could in principle be explored experimentally to test the modelling assumptions used to describe _ in vivo _",
    "bidirectional transport .",
    "further experimental work will improve our qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the details of transport process in the living cell , though the consequences of individual cargo behaviour on coordinated transport are not always clear . by using the model discussed in this paper , and developments thereof ,",
    "there is a platform with which one can address various open questions about the nature and function of the coordinated systems involved in cell transport",
    "in the bipolar section , the net current @xmath114 ( as discussed in section  [ sec_meanfield ] ) given by @xmath119 is constant when the system is in a statistically stationary state .",
    "this density - current relation gives @xmath210 which implies the `` equal '' and `` complementary '' density solutions : @xmath211 thus , the first order ode ( [ eq_pdesimple ] ) from the mean field approximation reads @xmath212 with a general solution of `` equal '' or `` complementary '' density @xmath213 for any non - zero net current @xmath114 on taking options in `` @xmath214 '' and `` @xmath215 '' .",
    "when both types of particles in the bipolar section are in low densities , they are dominated by the injection rates @xmath124 which are approximated by @xmath216 where @xmath131 is the equal density in the unipolar section .",
    "hence from ( [ eq_rho_smallj ] ) and ( [ eq_sigma_smallj ] ) , the densities on the first track in the bipolar section are approximated by @xmath217 together with the approximation @xmath218 , we find @xmath219 which gives a zero net current if @xmath186 . the density expressions  ( [ eq_den_ll ] )",
    "together with the symmetry @xmath69 and @xmath70 give the following @xmath220 thus @xmath221 that is , given a low overall density @xmath3 , a sufficiently large @xmath2 and assuming densities are low in the bipolar section , we have @xmath222 substituting ( [ eq_thetatobar ] ) , ( [ eq_j_ll ] ) and ( [ eq_bc_alpha_sigma ] ) into ( [ eq_den_ll ] ) gives the analytical approximation of the density profiles in the bipolar section in an ll - sl phase .",
