    "biological and ecological research has investigated cell migration . to model cell migration , studies have been composed to include migration , diffusion , haptotaxis , and chemotaxis , @xcite . in this paper , the focus is chemotaxis .",
    "chemotaxis describes the movement of an organism and/or groups of cells that either move toward or away from a chemical or sensory stimulus . in the early work by keller and segel @xcite , chemotactic responses of amoebae to bacteria",
    "is studied in a cellular slime mold .",
    "bacterial chemotaxis , which describes the ability of bacteria to move toward increased or decreased concentrations of attractants is analyzed at the macroscopic level through a microscopic model of individual cells , @xcite .",
    "it was first observed by engelmann @xcite in 1881 .",
    "for example , if _ salmonella typhimurium _ , a strain of salmonella associated with meat and poultry products , is introduced to a petri dish filled with a nutrient , the bacteria will migrate outward , consuming the nutrient .",
    "as they consume the nutrient , they secrete a chemoattractant .",
    "after several days , the bacteria will have clustered in the areas of high chemical concentration .",
    "a structure of concentric rings is usually observed experimentally .",
    "chet and mitchell s work @xcite describes patterns formed from _",
    "e. coli _ movement toward amino acids .",
    "allweis et .",
    "al @xcite investigate _ vibrio cholerae _ which are inhibited by a pepsin digest that reduces the possibility of the vibrios attaching to the intestinal wall .",
    "other authors @xcite have addressed chemotaxis in immune cell motility which when combined with tumor morphology is hoped to provide new avenues of treatment strategies .",
    "in addition , authors have analyzed chemotactic responses in ecology @xcite and have investigated mathematical issues for the existence of global solutions in multiple dimensions , @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis also arises in a variety of medical applications .",
    "in particular , it has been studied in connection with myxobacteria @xcite , leukocyte mobility in tissue inflammation @xcite , the migration of tumor cells towards bone @xcite , and other issues in morphogenesis @xcite .",
    "another interesting problem involves the study of vascular tumors through angiogenesis .",
    "angiogenesis involves the formation of capillary networks of blood vessels that are vital for the growth of tumors .",
    "mathematical modeling of angiogenesis @xcite has given new insight into tumor structure .",
    "normal tissue , lymphocytes , and other types of cells grow at the tumor site or are recruited through chemotaxis .",
    "the need to identify the nature of this recruitment is at the heart of this paper .",
    "the identification of a chemotactic term falls under the umbrella of an inverse problem . in principle",
    ", we can measure certain characteristics of the tumor concentration and use mathematical techniques to recover the chemotactic term , in particular the chemotactic sensitivity , that is driving the tumor growth . to our knowledge , this _ inverse problem _ approach has only been used in the analysis of chemotaxis models by dolak - stru and kgler @xcite under the assumption that the chemical concentration is explicitly known .",
    "since there are many applications in which chemotaxis arises , there are also different models of the chemotactic effect .",
    "there have been many different expressions proposed that model chemotactic velocity , see keller and segel @xcite , lapidus and schiller @xcite , ford and lauffenburger @xcite , and tyson et al .",
    ". this velocity is used in a bacterial conservation equation in the formulation of a system of partial differential equations that governs the particular application .",
    "the chemotactic sensitivity determines the velocity .",
    "our goal is to develop a technique whereby the appropriate chemotactic sensitivity model , and hence chemotactic velocity , can be determined from available data .",
    "in particular , we consider a system of partial differential equations that was developed by oster and murray @xcite to model the pattern formation of cartilage condensation in a vertebrate limb bud .",
    "a similar system was studied by myerscough et al . , @xcite . the numerical solution of similar systems were recently studied by tyson et al .",
    "@xcite and by nakaguchi and yagi @xcite .",
    "work by fister and mccarthy @xcite has shown that the system of partial differential equations can in fact be controlled theoretically through the introduction of a mechanism controlling the number of cells being generated .",
    "simulations provide optimal drug treatment programs for patients to facilitate the rebuilding of cartilage or the reduction of cancerous tumors .",
    "the chemotactic sensitivity in @xcite was known and the control parameter was a harvesting term .",
    "our goal in this work is to _ identify _ the chemotactic sensitivity .",
    "the paper is organized into six sections . in section two ,",
    "the existence of the forward problem is proven . in section three , identifiability of the chemotactic sensitivity",

    "in this model , @xmath0 and @xmath1 represent the concentration of the cells and the chemoattractant , respectively .",
