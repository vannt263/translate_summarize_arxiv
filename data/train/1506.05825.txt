    "since neutrinos are the only fermions that carry no electric charge , they can be represented by a majorana field for which the distinction between matter and antimatter vanishes .",
    "the majorana nature of neutrinos could play a fundamental role in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "for instance , the see - saw mechanism  @xcite , which requires the existence of a majorana neutrino , naturally explains the origin of small neutrino masses .",
    "a majorana neutrino would provide a framework for lepton number violation , and in particular for the leptogenesis process  @xcite , which could explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "the observation of neutrinoless double @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) decay would prove that neutrinos are majorana particles  @xcite and that lepton number is not conserved .",
    "the most commonly studied mechanism of @xmath1 decay is the exchange of a majorana neutrino .",
    "however , other mechanisms such as the existence of right - handed currents in the electroweak interaction , the exchange of supersymmetric particles with @xmath13-parity violating couplings , or the additional emission of a majoron particle , are possible . except for the case of majoron emission , the experimental signature of @xmath1 decays",
    "is the emission of two electrons with a total energy @xmath14 that is equal to the transition energy @xmath15 of the decay .    for a given mechanism and isotope ,",
    "the @xmath1 decay half - life depends on the phase space factors and on the nuclear matrix element ( nme ) .",
    "the decay half - lives of different isotopes can differ by a few orders of magnitude with large theoretical uncertainties of the nme calculations .",
    "it is therefore essential to search for @xmath1 decays in several isotopes .",
    "the nemo-3 detector  @xcite was operated from 2003 until 2010 in the modane underground laboratory ( lsm ) to measure two - neutrino double @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) decays of seven isotopes in the form of thin foils and to search for @xmath1 decays .",
    "the full topology of double @xmath0 decays is reconstructed by combining information from a calorimeter and a tracking detector that are both distinct from the source foils .",

    "these secondary electrons drift towards the anode wire at a speed of around 1 to 2 cm/@xmath33s depending on the distance of the electrons to the anode .",

    "the analog pmts signals are sent to both a low and a high threshold leading edge discriminator .",
    "if the pmt signal exceeds the lower level threshold it starts a tdc measurement and opens a charge integration gate for 80 ns . the high threshold discriminator works as a one shot that delivers a calorimeter event signal to the trigger logic which reflects the number of channels that have exceeded the upper threshold",
    "this level is used to trigger the system ( first level trigger ) if the desired multiplicity of active pmts is achieved . the trigger logic then produces a signal called stop - pmt , which is sent to all the calorimeter electronic channels , to save their data .",
