    "several deep results on the simplicity and ideal structure of reduced crossed products for group actions were proved around  1980 by olesen and pedersen @xcite , kishimoto @xcite , and rieffel  @xcite .",
    "the articles by olesen  pedersen and kishimoto were inspired by connes s work on von neumann algebraic factors and highlighted certain variants of the connes spectrum for actions of abelian groups .",
    "let  @xmath1 be a @xmath0-algebra , @xmath2 a discrete group with unit element  @xmath3 , and @xmath4 a group action .",
    "let @xmath5 be the reduced crossed product .",
    "we say that @xmath6 _ detects ideals _ if @xmath7 whenever @xmath8 is a non - zero ideal in  @xmath9 , and that @xmath6 _ separates ideals _ if @xmath10 whenever @xmath11 are ideals with @xmath12 .",
    "other sources such as  @xcite say that  @xmath13 has the `` intersection property '' when  @xmath1 detects ideals in  @xmath9 .",
    "ideals of the form @xmath14 for @xmath15 are always @xmath13-invariant , and any non - trivial @xmath13-invariant ideal in  @xmath1 generates a non - trivial ideal in  @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 is simple if and only if there are no @xmath13-invariant ideals in  @xmath1 and  @xmath1 detects ideals in  @xmath9 . roughly speaking",
    ", the articles mentioned above show that  @xmath1 detects ideals in the reduced crossed product  @xmath9 if  @xmath16 is `` sufficiently non - trivial '' for each @xmath17 , and the converse also holds if @xmath18 ( and  @xmath1 is separable or simple ) .",
    "many different conditions may be used to define `` sufficiently non - trivial '' automorphisms .",
    "olesen and pedersen proved , however , that most of them are equivalent when  @xmath1 is separable .",
    "they also used the connes spectrum to give a general necessary and sufficient criterion for  @xmath1 to detect ideals in  @xmath9 when  @xmath2 is abelian .",
    "this article extends many of these sufficient or necessary criteria for detection of ideals to fell bundles over groups instead of group actions by automorphisms .",
    "we improve upon the classical works in a few places by combining the work of the different schools or by noting that the old proofs actually show a bit more .",
    "in addition , we study when  @xmath1 separates ideals in  @xmath9 and when  @xmath1 supports  @xmath9 or  @xmath19 is a filling family for  @xmath9 , which is useful to decide whether  @xmath9 is purely infinite .",
    "popular conditions for `` sufficiently non - trivial '' actions are _ proper outerness _",
    "( see  @xcite ) and _ topological freeness _ ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , proper outerness is employed in the literature only if  @xmath1 is separable , when it is equivalent to topological freeness and to _ aperiodicity _ by the work of olesen and pedersen .",
    "aperiodicity requires a seemingly technical condition for  @xmath16 for all @xmath20 ( see definition  [ def : kishimoto ] below ) , which we call _ kishimoto s condition _ because its role was first highlighted by kishimoto  @xcite .",
    "the term aperiodicity was coined in  @xcite , where single @xmath0-correspondences were considered , and carried over to fell bundles over discrete groups in  @xcite . by a result of kishimoto  @xcite ,",
    "a group action is aperiodic if and only if it is _ pointwise spectrally non - trivial _ in the nomenclature of pasnicu and philips  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we show that , if  @xmath1 is separable or if  @xmath1 contains an essential ideal of type  i , then proper outerness , topological freeness , aperiodicity and a few more non - triviality conditions are equivalent and imply that  @xmath1 detects ideals in  @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , they are necessary for  @xmath1 to detect ideals in  @xmath9 if @xmath18 or @xmath21 for a square - free number @xmath22 . moreover , with  @xmath2 as above and arbitrary  @xmath1 , the reduced crossed product  @xmath9 is simple if and only if the action  @xmath13 is minimal and pointwise outer . usually , pointwise pure outerness is too weak to deduce that  @xmath1 detects ideals in  @xmath9 .",
    "it is equivalent to aperiodicity , however , if the group  @xmath2 is finite or if  @xmath1 is simple or contains an essential ideal of type  i. these results essentially follow from the classical work mentioned above .",
    "this is , however , not always appreciated in more recent work .",
    "separation of ideals is the residual version of detection of ideals .",
    "hence ( modulo exactness of the action  @xcite ) the results above show that  @xmath1 separates ideals in  @xmath9 if the action is residually aperiodic , and that the converse holds if @xmath18 or @xmath21 for a square - free number @xmath22 .",
    "even more , for a residually aperiodic action , @xmath19 is a filling family for  @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that  @xmath1 residually supports  @xmath9 , which in turn implies that  @xmath1 separates ideals in  @xmath9 .",
    "so for actions of @xmath23 or  @xmath24 with square - free  @xmath25 , all these properties are equivalent , at least when  @xmath1 is separable or contains an essential ideal of type  i. supporting subalgebras and filling families are closely related to the cuntz preorder and are used to show that  @xmath9 is purely infinite or strongly purely infinite , see @xcite .",
    "we will discuss this in section  [ sec : strong_pi ] .",
    "for these conditions related to pure infiniteness of  @xmath9 , aperiodicity plays a crucial role .",
    "our main goal is to generalise the above results to fell bundles over discrete groups .",
    "a fell bundle over  @xmath2 may be defined as a collection @xmath26 of closed linear subspaces of a @xmath0-algebra  @xmath9 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 for all @xmath29 .",
    "then @xmath30 is a @xmath0-subalgebra of  @xmath9 , and  @xmath9 is isomorphic to the reduced cross - sectional @xmath0-algebra @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 is dense in  @xmath9 and @xmath33 yields a well defined , faithful conditional expectation from  @xmath9 onto  @xmath1 . alternatively , @xmath34 if and only if there is a non - degenerate reduced coaction of  @xmath2 on  @xmath9 with @xmath35 as its spectral subspaces .",
    "in particular , a fell bundle over a discrete abelian group  @xmath2 is the same as a spectral decomposition for a continuous action of the compact group  @xmath36 , the pontryagin dual of  @xmath2 .",
    "the fibres of a fell bundle @xmath26 are hilbert bimodules over the unit fibre @xmath37 , and one may view  @xmath38 as an action of  @xmath2 on  @xmath1 by hilbert bimodules . in particular ,",
    "if  @xmath39 is a single hilbert bimodule , then its iterations given by the internal tensor product yield a canonical fell bundle @xmath40 , whose cross - sectional @xmath0-algebra is the crossed product @xmath41 introduced in  @xcite .    fell bundles and their @xmath0-algebras model not only crossed products by group actions , but also twisted crossed products , crossed products by partial actions ( see  @xcite ) and some crossed products by endomorphisms ( see @xcite*subsection  6.2 , @xcite*section  8) .",
    "these already provide many examples of structures that are not directly covered by the classical theory .",
    "moreover , proper ( regular ) product systems over an ore semigroup  @xmath42 may be dilated to fell bundles over the grothendieck group of  @xmath42 , so that the full cross - sectional @xmath0-algebra is isomorphic to the cuntz  pimsner algebra of the product system , see @xcite . in a sequel , we plan to apply the results of this article to reduced section algebras of inverse semigroup actions by hilbert bimodules .",
    "this includes reduced @xmath0-algebras of tale groupoids as a special case . in the groupoid case , separability need not be assumed .",
    "thus it is useful to prove that various properties of hilbert bimodules are equivalent over @xmath0-algebras that include commutative @xmath0-algebras , separable or not .",
    "let @xmath26 be a fell bundle over a discrete group and let @xmath30 .",
    "it seems that there is no good counterpart of proper outerness for  @xmath38 .",
    "topological freeness and aperiodicity , however , both generalise in an obvious way to fell bundles and have already been studied , see @xcite .",
    "_ aperiodicity _ is a fibrewise condition : it only considers the fibres  @xmath43 for @xmath44 of the fell bundle , not how they interact .",
    "it asks the hilbert @xmath1-bimodule  @xmath43 to satisfy _",
    "kishimoto s condition _ for each @xmath17 : for all non - zero hereditary subalgebras @xmath45 , all @xmath46 , and all @xmath47 there is a positive element  @xmath48 in  @xmath49 of norm  @xmath3 with @xmath50 .",
    "other fibrewise conditions for  @xmath38 such as _ pointwise pure outerness _ , _ pointwise universal weak outerness _ , or _",
    "pointwise topological non - triviality _ may also be defined easily , see section  [ sec : nontriviality ] .",
    "in particular , every hilbert @xmath1-bimodule  @xmath43 induces a partial homeomorphism  @xmath51 of the spectrum  @xmath52 of  @xmath1 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we call  @xmath38 _ pointwise topologically non - trivial _ if the set of fixed point for @xmath51 has empty interior in  @xmath52 for each @xmath17 .",
    "unlike these conditions , topological freeness is not a fibrewise condition . _",
    "topological freeness _ for a fell bundle  @xmath35 asks that for any finite subset @xmath53 , the union of the fixed point sets for  @xmath51 with @xmath54 has empty interior in  @xmath52 .",
    "it is already known that both topological freeness and aperiodicity are sufficient for  @xmath1 to detect ideals in @xmath31 for fell bundles over arbitrary discrete groups , and that aperiodicity is sufficient for  @xmath19 to support  @xmath31 , see @xcite . apart from this and",
    "some obvious relations nothing else was known so far .",
    "already for group actions , the relationship between pointwise topological non - triviality and topological freeness is delicate , see page  .",
    "the articles by olesen and pedersen imply , however , that all the aforementioned pointwise conditions ( except the pointwise pure outerness ) are equivalent to topological freeness of a group action if  @xmath1 is separable . here",
    "we generalise this and all the previously mentioned results for group actions to fell bundles .",
    "the proofs of statements of this nature for automorphisms are quite involved , and some of the ideas do not generalise readily to hilbert bimodules .",
    "so instead of proving the equivalences directly , we reduce our case of hilbert bimodules and fell bundles to the known case of automorphisms and group actions by automorphisms",
    ". why should this be possible ?",
    "first , any hilbert bimodule is known to be morita equivalent to a partial automorphism .",
    "secondly , any partial automorphism is known to be morita equivalent to one that has a globalisation , that is , it is the restriction of a global automorphism to a ( non - invariant ) ideal . a canonical such _ morita globalisation _ for fell bundles over discrete groups is constructed by abadie  @xcite using takai duality ( we make this notion formal in section  [ sec : morita_globalisation ] ) .",
    "this construction has useful extra properties , which can be used to show that the various properties of hilbert bimodules that we are interested in are equivalent for the given hilbert bimodule and this automorphism .",
    "so if these properties are equivalent for automorphisms , they remain equivalent for hilbert bimodules .",
    "in fact , in order to prove this we introduce and apply yet another device that we call a _ dense morita covering _ ( see section  [ sec : kish_permanence ] ) . if @xmath55 is a dense morita covering of a hilbert bimodule  @xmath39 , then  @xmath39 satisfies a given property if and only if all  @xmath56 for @xmath57 have this property ( see proposition  [ pro : dense_morita_covering ] ) .",
    "using this , we carry over results about group actions to fell bundles , and extend some results to the case when  @xmath1 contains an essential ideal of type  i , separable or not ( see section  [ sec : tok ] ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the properties relevant for pure infiniteness and strong pure infiniteness are invariant under our morita globalisations .",
    "so we study the relationships between them directly .",
    "moreover , the usual definitions of the connes spectrum and the strong connes spectrum do not generalise to hilbert bimodules . instead",
    ", we characterise them using the lattice of ideals in the crossed product and the sublattice of graded ideals .",
    "these definitions make perfect sense for fell bundles .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : automorphisms ] combines and exploits some of the known results about automorphisms and group actions by automorphisms in a way suitable for our later generalisations . section  [ sec : hilmi_crossed ] recalls preliminaries on hilbert bimodules , fell bundles and their crossed products .",

    "section  [ sec : morita_globalisation ] introduces a canonical morita globalisation for a fell bundle and proves some of its fundamental properties . in section  [ sec : tok ] , we use morita globalisations and morita coverings to generalise and extend relationships between non - triviality conditions from single automorphisms to single hilbert bimodules . in section",
    "[ sec : connes_spectrum ] , we define the connes and strong connes spectra for a fell bundle over an abelian discrete group and for single hilbert bimodules .",
    "we relate these notions to aperiodicity or pure outerness of fell bundles , and to detection or separation of ideals in  @xmath31 .",
