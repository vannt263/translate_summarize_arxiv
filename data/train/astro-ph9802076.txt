    "@xmath0 scuti variables are short - period pulsators situated inside the classical instability strip on and near the main sequence ( hereafter called ms ) .",
    "they represent stars in the hydrogen - burning stage with masses from 1.5 @xmath5 to about 2.5 @xmath5 for the more evolved variables .    the majority of @xmath0 scuti stars pulsates with a multitude of nonradial p and g  modes ( often of mixed character ) and low amplitudes near the detection limit of 0.5 millimag .",
    "a numerically small subgroup has exceptionally low rotational velocities of @xmath6 30 km s@xmath2 with pulsation properties resembling the classical cepheids and rr lyrae stars : radial pulsation in the fundamental or first overtone mode with high amplitudes between 0.3 and 1 mag . in the past",
    ", the stars in this high - amplitude ( hads ) subgroup were sometimes referred to as dwarf cepheids or ai vel stars .",
    "they are observationally favored for the study of period stability because of large amplitudes and the presence of only a few excited modes ( usually one or two ) .",
    "the period changes caused by stellar evolution in and across the lower instability strip permit an observational test of stellar evolution theory , provided that other physical reasons for period changes can be excluded . the period ",
    "mean density relation for pulsating stars predicts a period - luminosity - color - mass relation of the form    @xmath7 where p is the radial period and @xmath8 is the stellar mass in solar units . for the @xmath0 scuti variables with known radial pulsation , the observed coefficients are in almost exact agreement with those predicted by the period ",
    "mean density relation ( breger 1980 ) .",
    "this confirmation of the theoretical relation is very important : since the period - luminosity - relation holds for stars in different evolutionary stages , it should also hold for a single star at different evolutionary stages . for individual stars , evolutionary period changes must occur , at least over long time scales .",
    "an evolutionary change in @xmath9 and @xmath10 leads to a period change of size    @xmath11 where the coefficient of 0.69 has been derived by multiplying the coefficient of 0.3 by @xmath12 10 from the differentiation .    in the lower instability strip , where the @xmath0 scuti stars are found",
    ", stellar evolution leads to increasing periods in the vast majority of stars , with predicted increases of ( 1/p)dp / dt from 10@xmath13 year@xmath2 on the ms to 10@xmath1 year@xmath2 for the longer - period evolved variables .",
    "( more exact values will be computed in a later section of this paper . )",
    "such period changes should be observable .",
    "there have been several comparisons between theoretical and observed period changes .",
    "the careful compilation by percy et al . ( 1980 ) led to inconclusive results .",
    "they state that ` the study of period changes has had a long and sometimes dubious history ' and find that ` in most cases is a source of confusion and frustration . '",
    "breger ( 1990a ) had more data at his disposal and noted that for the four evolved @xmath0 scuti stars of pop .",
    "i the observed period decreases were in contradiction to the radius increases predicted from stellar evolution .",
    "guzik & cox ( 1991 ) have examined possible explanations for the period decreases seen in evolved @xmath0 scuti stars . while their models indeed predicted smaller period increases , period decreases were not found .",
    "the fact that all four evolved @xmath0 scuti stars show period decreases may conceivably be a reflection of an additional period changing mechanism ( leading to random changes ) coupled with small - number statistics .",
    "the recent results for the star ai vel ( walraven et al .",
    "1992 ) support such a view .",
    "they have found that only one of the two radial frequencies shows a period increase , while the second frequency was essentially constant .",
    "the example of ai vel shows that ( slow ) stellar evolution is not the only mechanism to generate changes in the periods of pulsation .",
    "this means that for an individual star the conversion of observed period changes into stellar evolution rates ( e.g. radius changes ) has to be applied with caution .",
    "the nonevolutionary period changes should cancel out only for a larger group of stars in the same stage of evolution .",
    "an important update and analysis was provided by rodriguez et al .",

    "the models of 1.52.5 @xmath5 in ms and post - ms evolutionary stages were constructed using a standard stellar evolution code which was developed in its main parts by b.  paczyski , m.  kozowski and r.  sienkiewicz ( private communication ) .",
    "the same code was used in our recent studies of fg  virginis ( breger et al .",
    "1995 ) and xx  pyxidis ( handler et al .",
    "1997a , b ; pamyatnykh et al .",
    "the computations were performed starting from chemically uniform models on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , assuming an initial hydrogen abundance @xmath14 and a heavy element abundance @xmath15 .",
    "the standard mixing - length theory of convection with the mixing - length parameter @xmath16 was used .",
    "the choice of the mixing - length parameter has only a small effect on our models because they are too hot to have an effective energy transfer by convection in the stellar envelope . for the opacities , we used latest version of the opal tables ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) supplemented with the low  temperature data of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) . in all computations the opal equation of state",
    "was used ( rogers et al .",
    ".    some @xmath0 scuti stars may be very young evolving towards the ms .",
    "we did not compute pre - ms evolution explicitly .",
    "instead we used the evolutionary tracks computed by dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) for the ` mlt alexander ' set of input parameters = 1.4 ; opal opacities due to iglesias & rogers ( 1993 ) supplemented with low  temperature opacities due to alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) ; initial hydrogen abundance @xmath14 , heavy element abundance @xmath17 . ] , which are close to those used in our computations .",
    "the pre - ms and post - ms tracks are plotted in for three values of stellar mass .",
    "there is good agreement between the positions of zams models constructed by dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) and our zams models .",
    "therefore we can conclude that both series of the computations are consistent with each other .    for ms and post - ms models we performed a linear nonadiabatic analysis of low  degree oscillations ( @xmath18@xmath192 )",
    "using the code developed by w.  dziembowski ( for a general description see dziembowski 1977 ) . in fig .",
    "1 we have also shown the theoretical blue edges of the @xmath0  scuti instability strip which were computed for radial oscillations of the models with initial hydrogen abundance @xmath14 and heavy element abundance @xmath15 . the general blue edge ( @xmath20 ) is the hottest envelope of blue edges for overtones , from @xmath21 at the zams to @xmath22 in the upper parts of both panels .",
    "there are no unstable modes in models to the left of this line .",
    "@xmath23 is the blue edge for the radial fundamental mode .",
    "note that in the region under consideration the onset of the instability is practically insensitive to the spherical degree of a mode , so that the position of the blue edges will be unchanged when studying nonradial oscillations .",
    "@xmath24 is the empirical red edge transformed from the photometric data to the theoretical parameters ( we used simplest approximation about constancy of the convective flux during the oscillation cycle , therefore we were not able to determine theoretical red edge of the instability strip ) .    to study oscillations in the pre - ms evolutionary stage , we constructed envelope models using global stellar parameters ( mass , effective temperature and luminosity ) along the evolutionary tracks computed by dantona & mazzitelli ( 1994 ) , and then computed radial oscillations of these models .",
    "the envelopes were integrated from the surface to a layer with temperature @xmath25 which corresponds to relative radius @xmath26 in all models considered . for such deep envelopes ,",
    "the periods of radial oscillations are practically the same as for full stellar models : in a 1.8 @xmath5 model near the zams where the errors are largest , the difference in the low ",
    "overtone periods between envelope and full models does not exceed 0.07  % .",
    "these errors have no influence on the determination of evolutionary period changes . to calculate period changes we used one more result of dantona & mazzitelli : the age of the correspoding pre - ms model .",
    "note that our evolutionary tracks and periods of oscillations agree with those from a recent paper by petersen & christensen  dalsgaard ( 1996 ) .",
    "the rates of evolutionary period changes were derived using computed values of the oscillation periods and the ages of the corresponding models .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "2 separately for four consecutive evolutionary stages .",
    "the periods of radial oscillations decrease during the pre - ms and the second overall contraction stages , and increase during the ms and post - ms expansion stages .",
    "the rate of these changes is determined entirely by the rate of evolution .",
    "the typical time spent by a star in the instability strip is quite different for different evolutionary stages : depending on stellar mass , this time is about @xmath27@xmath28 gyr for the pre - ms stage , @xmath29@xmath30 gyr for the ms stage , @xmath31@xmath32 gyr for the second overall contraction stage and @xmath31@xmath33 gyr for the post - ms expansion stage .",
    "therefore , values of period changes can differ one from another by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the fastest period changes , which can be easier detected , occur during pre - ms evolution . therefore , pre - ms variables seem to be the best candidates to test the stellar evolution rate empirically .",
    "some indications in favor of significant overshooting from convective cores of @xmath0 scuti stars were obtained from a comparison of evolutionary tracks with calibrated photometric data ( e. g. napiwotzki et al .",
    "1993 ) . an asteroseismological test , based on sensitivity of some nonradial mode frequencies to the size of mixed stellar core , was proposed by dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 1991 ) .",
    "another important parameter which must influence stellar evolution and pulsations , is rotation .",
    "detailed studies of non  evolutionary rotational effects on the oscillation frequency spectrum are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "some estimates of the second order rotational corrections to period ratios were obtained by prez hernndez et al .",
    "( 1994 ) ; the complexity of the mode identification problem in the presence of rotation is demonstrated by pamyatnykh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in an attempt to find a seismic solution to 13 observable frequencies of xx pyxidis ( for a short discussion see pikall et al .",
    "however , rotation significantly modifies the structure and evolution of a star .",
    "it may be desirable to compare the rate of period changes in such models with that of standard non - rotating models .    to test the effects of overshooting and rotation explicitly , we computed two new families of evolutionary tracks of 1.52.5 @xmath5 : models with overshooting from the convective core and rotating models without overshooting .",
    "the overshooting distance , @xmath34 , was chosen to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the local pressure scale height at the edge of the convective core .",
    "a similar value of the overshooting parameter was used by many authors ( see , for example , schaller et al .",
    "1992 , napiwotzki et al .",
    "1993 , claret 1995 ) .",
    "the tracks with and without overshooting are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    the overshooting results in an extension of the ms  stage in the hr diagram due to an enlargement of the mixed core : more hydrogen fuel is available for nuclear burning .",
    "the displacement of the tams - points is about @xmath37 , @xmath38 to @xmath39 , overshooting influences the tams position 1.52 times smaller than according to schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , napiwotzki et al .",
    "( 1993 ) or claret ( 1995 ) .",
    "the disagreement may be caused by numerical effects as a test shows .",
    "to achieve a sufficient accuracy in the oscillation computations we need to rely upon more detailed stellar models than one uses usually in the evolutionary computations .",
    "for example , our typical 2.0 @xmath5 ms model consists of approximately 1300 layers , and there are 135 models between the zams and tams .",
    "if we increase both space and time step sizes by factor of about 78 , we can reproduce the corresponding evolutionary track of schaller et al .",
    "( 1992 ) almost precisely . ] . at a fixed effective temperature , a model with overshooting",
    "is slightly more luminous than a standard model without overshooting .",
    "stellar lifetimes in the ms  stage are increased due to overshooting by 1214 percent . at the tams , hydrogen is slightly more exhausted in models with overshooting :",
    "the central hydrogen abundance is about 4.0 % ( in mass ) as compared with 4.5 % in the case without overshooting .",
    "it is interesting to compare stellar lifetimes in different evolutionary stages for the models with and without overshooting .",
    "let us consider segments of the evolutionary tracks of the 1.8 @xmath5 model in the effective temperature range between the tams and the leftmost point of the second contraction stage .",
    "the star crosses that region three times in its life on and beyond the ms . in the overshooting case ( @xmath40 ,",
    "3 ) these times are equal to 0.35 , 0.034 , and 0.019 gyr for ms , second contraction and post - ms expansion stages , correspondingly . in the standard case without overshooting ( @xmath41 ) these times are equal to 0.35 , 0.038 , and 0.056 gyr .",
    "we see that in both cases the second contraction times are similar and are one order of magnitude shorter than in the final part of the ms  evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "post - ms expansion in the overshooting case is a factor of 1.8 faster , and in the standard case a factor of 1.5 slower than the corresponding second contraction .",
    "such a significant difference in the post - ms expansion times between evolution with and without overshooting seems to be important for statistical investigations of the @xmath0  scuti stars .",
    "for another family of models we assumed uniform ( solid - body ) stellar rotation and conservation of global angular momentum during evolution from the zams .",
    "these assumptions were chosen due to their simplicity .",
    "the same approach was used in our recent studies of xx  pyxidis ( handler et al .",
    "1997a , b ; pamyatnykh et al .",
    "1997 ) the initial equatorial rotational velocity was assumed to be 150 km / s .",
    "the tracks for rotating and non - rotating models are shown in fig .",
    "4 .    rotation results in a shift of the tracks to smaller @xmath9 and gravity .",
    "the displacement of the tams mimics the overshooting effect , with @xmath42 , @xmath43 smaller by a factor 1.5 in comparison with those for the overshooting case ( compare figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the tracks of rotating models lie slightly above the tracks of non - rotating models in @xmath44 diagram , and below the corresponding tracks in @xmath45 diagram which can be easily explained by decreasing effective gravity due to centrifugal force .",
    "the ms lifetime for rotating models is only 0.51.0 percent longer than that for non - rotating models . with our assumption on the global angular momentum conservation the equatorial rotational velocity is decreasing during the ms  evolution from 150 km",
    "/ s at the zams to about 120 km / s at the tams .    on the ms ,",
    "the effects of the overshooting and rotation on period changes are determined practically entirely by mentioned changes in positions of the tracks . in a plot similar to fig .",
    "2b , lines of constant period changes for the overshooting case will be prolongated to smaller gravities due to the tams displacement .",
    "for the rotating models we will obtain a small shift of the isolines to lower gravities according to both the zams and the tams displacements .",
    "we disregard the rotation effects on evolutionary period changes in the rest of this paper because they mimic the overshooting effects but are less pronounced than these .",
    "we will show in this subsection that fast period changes , more pronounced for the overshooting case , can occur during very short phases of the post - ms evolution . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "3 , there is a noticeable difference in the morphology of the tracks with and without overshooting at the end the second overall contraction stage . here a negative and a positive peak in the period changes are produced .",
    "physically , at this stage a significant reorganization of stellar interior structure occurs : towards the end of the second overall contraction stage the convective core begins to decrease very quickly due to progressive inefficiency of the nuclear - energy generation in the center , which , in turn , is caused by hydrogen exhaustion .",
    "this process occurs more suddenly in the overshooting case : for example , in the 1.8 @xmath5 model the decrease of the convective core from the value of 0.005 ( mass fraction ) to 0.0 lasts for about 0.9 million years which is three times faster than in the standard case . at the end of the overall contraction stage",
    "the convective core disappears .",
    "as hydrogen is effectively exhausted in the center , this region rapidly cools and contracts .",
    "a significant part of the luminosity is provided with release of thermal and gravitational energy . simultaneously with the cooling at the center ( in the inner 67 % of stellar mass ) the heating outside this region occurs where hydrogen is more abundant . as a consequence , a nuclear hydrogen - burning shell is established outside the hydrogen - exchausted core . the stellar luminosity adjusts quickly to the energy production by the nuclear shell - burning source . in the hr diagram ,",
    "such ` non - explosive hydrogen ignition ' occurs on the ascending part of the evolutionary track soon beyond a small loop .",
    "details of post - ms stages of standard stellar evolution were described more than thirty years ago by iben ( 1967 and references therein ) . when discussing a very fast stage of the convective core disappearance and of the hydrogen - burning shell development , the overshooting _ versus _",
    "non - overshooting analysis seems to be similar to the analysis of the standard evolution of models of different mass : for a higher mass we proceed to construct the models with more extended convective cores .",
    "therefore , as was noted by iben ( 1966 ) in his discussion of the @xmath46 _ versus _ @xmath47 evolution , the nuclear fuel disappears suddenly over a somewhat larger fraction of the interior . as a consequence , ` semidynamic ' effects of the stellar structure reorganization are manifestated more clearly ( see small loops in our tracks ) .",
    "the time spent by a 1.8 @xmath5 star in the small loop near the end of overall contraction stage is equal to 0.0015 and 0.0014 gyr for the overshooting and the standard case , correspondingly .",
    "it is 25 times shorter than the total time of overall contraction .",
    "the periods of the radial fundamental mode and their changes during late ms and post - ms evolution of a 1.8 @xmath5 star are shown in fig .",
    "5 . note that the ms  evolution with overshooting lasts for about 13  % longer than in the standard case ( 1.31 and 1.16 gyr , correspondingly ) . at the same time",
    ", post - ms evolution occurs more rapidly in the overshooting case .",
    "the dips in the period behaviour and corresponding peaks in the rate of the period change are seen clearly with those of heller & kawaler and found agreement in the ms stage .",
    "however , our peak values of period changes are three times larger for negative peaks and six times larger for positive peaks .",
    "also , the positions of our peaks are shifted to higher ages .",
    "these differences can be explained by differences in the evolutionary tracks .",
    "somewhat higher new opal opacities in the interior result in an enlargement of the convective core and in a corresponding extension of ms evolutionary stage .",
    "the situation is similar to our comparison of the overshooting case with the standard case ( see fig .",
    "these features are produced during a very short phase around the end of overall contraction ( small loop in the evolutionary track , see fig .",
    "3 ) . in the overshooting case , the maximum positive period change is about @xmath48 yr@xmath2 which is 2.5 times larger than that in the standard case .",
    "we stress that due to the short duration of this stage the probability to observe these large period changes is small .",
    "we have collected , examined , and in some cases recalculated the observed period changes for @xmath0 scuti stars .",
    "most available data refer to stars with radial pulsation and large amplitudes .",
    "the period changes are usually derived from a collection of observed times of maximum light .",
    "regrettably , a potentially confusing variety of different units can be found in the literature . in a few cases ,",
    "these have lead to errors .",
    "because of these problems it appears prudent to list the equations and units used in this paper :    let ( o - c ) refer to the difference in the observed and computed times of maxima measured in days . if the adopted period , p , is correct and refers to the beginning of a long series of observations covering a time t ( also in days ) , then @xmath49 this equation is similar to an expression derived by percy et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , where phase units are used .",
    "it is customary to express ( 1/p)dp / dt in units of year@xmath2 , so that the value of ( 1/p)dp / dt found above has to be multiplied by a factor of 365.25 .",
    "ambiguities should not be present if the observations are expressed in terms of the times of maximum light ( epoch ) : @xmath50 where @xmath51 = p dp / dt , t@xmath52 refers to the epoch and p@xmath52 to the period at the time of the listed epoch .",

    "the disagreement should not be caused by incorrectly computed rates of stellar evolution , since the situation will not be changed significantly if we take into account some additional effects such as rotation or convective overshooting .",
    "an exception may only occur during the very fast stages of post - ms evolution as has been discussed in subsection 2.4 .",
    "it can be seen in fig . 6",
    "that overshooting results in a significant enlargement of the zigzag domain and a shift to somewhat longer periods . in principle , up to half of observed period changes could now be accounted for .",
    "let us examine a possible contender for the zigzag domain in more detail : the star ai vel .",
    "the values of both the observed radial fundamental and first overtone modes place the star inside or near the zigzag domain . the value of the period ratio is accurately known and can be fitted to this fast evolutionary stage without any problems .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , which is similar to fig . 11 in the paper by petersen & christensen - dalsgaard ( 1996 ) .",
    "it can be seen that a model of 2.0  @xmath5 with the overshooting parameter @xmath34 between 0.0 and @xmath35 can fit the observational periods of ai  vel very precisely .",
    "consequently , ai vel may be an example of a star in the zigzag domain of fig .",
    "6 so that the observed period change of the first overtone could be explained .",
    "however , the radial fundamental mode of ai vel is also observed and shows no period changes .",
    "this is not in agreement with the computations .",
    "furthermore , the agreement between positions of many stars in table 1 with the zigzag domain may be accidental .",
    "stellar evolution in this region around the end of the second overall contraction stage is very fast , as was already demonstrated in fig . 5 : for a 1.8 @xmath5 star , the stage of the negative and positive peaks in the period change takes not longer than 1.5 million years .",
    "the probability of finding such a high fraction of the observed stars in this short evolutionary stage is essentially zero .",
    "consequently , the overall disagreement between the observed and expected period changes is not removed .    among the pop .",
    "i radially pulsating @xmath0 scuti stars , ae uma has the fastest measured period change of 5 x 10@xmath1 year@xmath2 .",
    "the data look reliable .",
    "the rate of the period decrease is similar to that expected for pre - ms variables ( see fig .",
    ". however , there exists no evidence that ae uma is a pre - ms star .    in an earlier discussion of three giants of similar luminosity and temperature , breger ( 1990a ) noted that , at least in principle , the theoretical evolutionary tracks could be adjusted to lead to decreasing radii in this part of the hr diagram .",
    "however , the present analysis also shows disagreements for the less evolved stars .",
    "this makes an explanation in terms of completely erroneous evolutionary tracks improbable .",
    "an additional , but possibly unneeded argument concerns the observed period  luminosity relation shown by the hundreds of @xmath0  scuti detected so far , indicating a radius increase for the more evolved stars with longer periods ( see introduction ) .",
    "the disagreement between observed and computed evolutionary period changes is even worse for the stars showing nonradial pulsation .",
    "however , the calculation of the nonradial pulsation frequencies and their evolutionary changes is more complicated than for radial pulsation .",
    "the reason is that the rotational splitting may change with evolution so that modes with different values of the azimuthal order , @xmath59 , may show different period changes , even in the same star ( as observed ) .",
    "we conclude that the period changes observed in @xmath0 scuti stars are not caused by stellar evolutionary changes .",
    "the period changes can not at this stage be used to check stellar evolution calculations . of course",
    ", the evolutionary changes should still be present in these stars , but are masked by other effects causing period changes",
    ". a much larger sample of stars is needed to average out these other effects .      the physical origin of the observed nonevolutionary period changes",
    "is not known .",
    "there are several suggestions in the literature :    stellar companions can produce ( o - c ) shifts due to the light - time effects caused by the orbital motion . with limited amounts of data the observed shifts",
    "can often be matched equally well by both parabolic and trigonometric functions , so that a binary origin of the time shifts can not be ruled out .",
    "the ambiguity has been demonstrated by fu & jiang ( 1996 ) for the star ad cmi .",
    "the situation is , however , not hopeless : the orbital changes reverse themselves over a longer time scale .",
    "it is possible that most of period changes which are observed in @xmath0 scuti stars are caused by nonlinear mode interactions , not by some specific processes in the interiors like considered by sweigart & renzini ( 1979 ) for rr lyrae models almost twenty years ago .",
    "( the authors proposed random mixing events in a semiconvective zone to be the origin of period changes of both signs , especially sudden period jumps .",
    "it was noted by rodriguez et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and others that some of the changes in @xmath0 scuti stars resemble those also seen in rr lyrae stars .",
    "however , there is no semiconvective zone in the less evolved @xmath0 scuti stars . )",
    "the effect of period changes due to nonlinear mode interactions was demonstrated in a completely different context by buchler et al .",
    "the authors studied nonlinear behaviour of rotationally split dipole ( @xmath60 ) modes in pulsating stars .",
    "in particular , when all three components of the triplet are excited and the amplitudes are constant , the direct nonlinear interactions between components result in symmetric frequency spacing .",
    "this is contrary to the results from linear theory , in which the second order effects of rotation cause the rotational mode splitting to be highly nonequidistant ( see dziembowski & goode , 1992 ) .",
    "another specific case of the nonlinear mode interactions was studied by moskalik ( 1985 ) .",
    "he considered the problem of resonant coupling of an unstable mode to two lower frequency stable modes . for @xmath0 scuti stars",
    "such an approach means that a low  order radial or nonradial unstable mode interacts with two stable gravity modes .",
    "the coupling can result in a periodic amplitude modulation .",
    "the period of the modulation depends mainly on the excitation rate of the unstable mode and is supposed to be of the order of years in @xmath0 scuti stars . during most of the modulation cycle the amplitude of the unstable mode grows nearly exponentially but finally decreases rapidly due to nonlinear interactions with the two stable modes .",
    "the large jump of pulsation phase occurs simultaneously  positive or negative depending on the sign of the frequency mismatch in the resonance condition . before and after this jump one can observe very fast changes of the pulsation period .",
    "for @xmath0 scuti models in a wide range of oscillation parameters the rate of these fast period changes ( 1/p ) dp / dt was found to lie , approximately , between @xmath61 and @xmath62 year@xmath2 .",
    "these large values can be appropriate to interpret some changes like observed in xx  pyxidis ( see handler et al .",
    "as mentioned by moskalik , a very serious limitation of his study is connected with the assumption that only three modes take part in the interaction .",
    "if the radially pulsating pop .",
    "i stars with observed period changes are plotted on the @xmath63 ",
    "@xmath64 diagram ( fig .",
    "3 ) , it can be seen that all stars are located close to the theoretical blue edge of the fundamental radial mode .",
    "this conformity may be accidental because the fundamental blue edge lies approximately along the most populated central part of the instability strip .",
    "moreover , the calibration errors may be significant too .",
    "but if this agreement is real , then , potentially , it can take a part in the future period change interpretations . at this line",
    "the fundamental radial mode instability appears or disappears depending on the direction of evolution .",
    "that means that quite significant changes in the excitation or damping rate of different modes may occur .",
    "they must influence the efficiency of the nonlinear interactions between different modes which , in turn , may influence the periods more significantly than during stages of more steady oscillations .    the situation for comparing",
    "observed period changes with stellar evolution calculations may be brighter for pre - ms stars .",
    "the calculations shown in fig . 6 indicate expected period changes a factor of 10 to 100 times larger than for ms stars . in fact , these expected rates of period change are even larger than the nonevolutionary period changes of ms stars .",
    "consequently , the evolutionary changes might not be hidden among other effects . a few @xmath0 scuti stars with probable pre - ms status",
    "are known , e. g. the stars w2 and w20 in ngc 2264 .",
    "so far , the variability of these stars has not been studied since their discovery as @xmath0 scuti stars ( breger 1972 ) .",
    "the study of period changes among the pre - ms stars appears to be very promising , in contrast to ms and post - ms stars .",
    "the evidence is accumulating that most of the observed period changes in the pop .",
    "ii @xmath0 scuti stars occur in sudden jumps , followed by constant or nearly - constant periods .",
    "this is clearly shown in the star cy aqr ( powell et al .",
    "furthermore , the abrupt period change of 1989 reversed the decreases in period from the previous two period changes .",
    "this convincingly argues against the interpretation of the period changes in terms of long - term stellar evolution ( at least in this star ) .",
    "other stars tend to show a similar behavior : the star xx cyg had a sudden period change in 1942 ( szeidl & mahdy 1991 ) , while the ( o - c ) variations of sx phe are best interpreted as two sudden jumps in 1969 and 1975 ( thompson & coates 1991 ) . in all three stars , the jumps were of the order of @xmath3 10@xmath4 .    the data for the star dy peg can be interpreted equally well as either a sudden jump in 1961 or a continuous change ( see mahdy & szeidl 1980 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "bl cam shows a continuously changing period .",
    "the character of the observed period changes in @xmath0 sct stars suggest that they are caused by nonlinear effects in pulsation and not by stellar evolution , at least in most cases .",
    "therefore the main application of the data we collected here could be used in the future to test the theory of nonlinear multimode stellar oscillation .",
