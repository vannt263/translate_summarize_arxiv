    "a thermal counterflow in he ii is internal convection of two fluids , namely the normal fluid and the superfluid .",
    "when the counterflow velocity exceeds a critical value , a self - sustaining tangle of quantized vortices appears to form superfluid turbulence . in low aspect ratio channels ,",
    "superfluid turbulence makes the mysterious transition .",
    "the increase in the counterflow velocity is observed to change the laminar state to the first turbulent state ti , and next to the second turbulent state tii @xcite .",
    "melotte and barenghi suggested that the transition from the ti to tii state is caused by the transition of the normal fluid from laminar to turbulent @xcite .",
    "the recent developments of the visualization technique have enabled us to confirm the scenario .",
    "guo @xmath0 have followed the motion of seeded metastable @xmath1 molecules by a laser - induced - fluoresence technique to observe that the normal fluid can be turbulent at relatively high velocities @xcite .    to understand the mysterious transition of counterflow quantum turbulence , it is necessary to address the coupled dynamics of the two fluids ;",
    "the superfluid is described by the vortex filament model , the normal fluid by the navier - stokes equation , and they are coupled through the mutual friction @xcite . however , it is difficult to solve fully the coupled dynamics . as the first essential step , we address the ti state in a square channel with prescribing the velocity field of the normal fluid to a poiseuille profile .",
    "our simulation obtains a statically steady state of an inhomogeneous vortex tangle .",
    "baggaley @xmath0 @xcite studied numerically a thermal counterflow between two plates .",
    "they prescribed a poiseuille and turbulent profiles for the velocity field of the normal fluid .",
    "an inhomogeneous vortex tangle was obtained , where vortices concentrated near the solid boundaries .",
    "they suggested that their results supported the scenario proposed by melotte and barenghi .",
    "the better understanding of the ti and tii states would be obtained by studying the flow in a low aspect ratio channel where all boundaries are solid except for the flow direction .",
    "this is because the ti and tii states are actually observed in low aspect ratio channels and another turbulence tiii state is observed in high aspect ratio channels @xcite .",
    "in a vortex filament model @xcite a quantized vortex is represented by a filament passing through a fluid and has a definite vorticity .",
    "this approximation is very suitable in he ii , since the core size of a quantized vortex is much smaller than any other characteristic length scale . at zero temperature",
    "the vortex filament moves with the superfluid velocity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the velocity field produced by vortex filaments , @xmath4 by solid boundaries , and @xmath5 is the applied superfluid velocity .",
    "the velocity field @xmath3 is given by the biot - savart law ; this work addresses the full biot - savart integral @xcite .",
    "since @xmath5 represents the laminar flow of the superfluid , @xmath5 requires irrotational condition , which is supposed to be uniform .",
    "the velocity field @xmath4 is obtained by a simple procedure ; it is just the field produced by an image vortex which is constructed by reflecting the filament into the surface and reversing its direction .",

    "section 4.1 addresses the mechanism for sustaining the inhomogeneous vortex tangle . in section 4.2",

    "we consider how the aspect ratio of the channel cross section affects the two fluids .      as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , the vld shows the non - linear oscillation with large amplitude in the statistical steady state , which is much different from the case of the uniform counterflow @xcite .",
    "the non - linear oscillation comes from the space - time oscillation of the vortex tangle through the mutual friction under the poiseuille flow .",
    "figure 3 shows the space - time pattern of the vortex tangle at 1.9 k. the period of the non - linear oscillation is about 0.6 s , consisting of four stages ( a)-(d ) . in fig .",
    "3 ( a ) corresponding to the minimum of the vld , vortices are dilute , where vortices remain only near the solid walls . then the vortices near the walls invade to the central region in fig . 3 ( b ) .",
    "these vortices make lots of reconnections in the central region subject to the large counterflow in fig .",
    "hence the vld increases significantly to the maximum . eventually in fig .",
    "3 ( d ) the poiseuille flow excludes the vortex tangle from the central region toward the solid walls .",
    "thus the vld around the central region decreases , and the vortices are absorbed by the solid boundaries .",
    "then the vortex tangle returns to the stage of fig .",
    "therefore the vortex tangle repeats the periodic motion , resulting in the non - linear oscillation of fig .",
    "the vortex tangle sustained by this mechanism is more dilute than the case of the uniform counterflow for the same @xmath36 and @xmath24 .",

    "2 ( b ) is caused by the temperature dependent parameters , namely the density ratio @xmath38 of the two fluids and the mutual friction coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the increase in temperature causes two competitive effects as described in the following .",
    "one effect is that the increase of @xmath39 decreases @xmath40 .",
    "the thermal counterflow requires the conservation of mass , yielding @xmath41 where @xmath42 is spatially averaged @xmath43 over the cross section of the channel .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 increases with temperature .",
    "thus the counterflow velocity @xmath45 becomes more uniform at higher temperature , since @xmath5 is uniform and @xmath46 is non - uniform .",
    "figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the counterflow velocity profile .",
    "the other effect is that the enhancement of the mutual friction increases @xmath47 .",
    "the mutual friction makes the vortex tangle inhomogeneous under the non - uniform @xmath48 .",
    "therefore the increase in temperature renders the profiles of @xmath48 uniform but enhances this action of the mutual friction .",
    "these two competitive effects maximize the inhomogeneity @xmath47 at some @xmath36 .",
    "( a ) @xmath36=1.3  k ( @xmath39=0.052 )",
    "( b ) @xmath36=1.9  k ( @xmath39=0.738 )      the aspect ratio of the channel plays an important role in the density and the profile of the vortex tangle .",
    "the increase of the aspect ratio from unity reduces the counterflow velocity gradient along the long side of the cross section .",
    "thus the exclusion of the vortex tangle shown in fig .",
    "3 ( d ) does not work so much along the long side of the cross section .",
    "hence the vld should increase compared to the vld in a low aspect ratio channel .    it would be meaningful to consider how the aspect ratio affects the normal fluid , though it is prescribed in this formulation .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the navier - stokes equation shows that the critical reynolds number for turbulence transition of a viscous fluid increases significantly with decreasing the aspect ratio @xcite . according to this result",
    ", the normal fluid in counterflow could remain laminar in a low aspect ratio channel even if the superfluid becomes turbulent and the vortex tangle disturbs the normal fluid , which may correspond to the ti state . in order to understand the ti state ,",
    "therefore , the studies in a low aspect ratio channel like this work will be indispensable .",
