    "the study of spin ladder systems @xcite has made rapid progress since their synthesis @xcite and identification .",
    "@xcite among the problems investigated both theoretically and experimentally are the nature of the ground state , which is dramatically different for ladders composed of odd and even numbers of chains , the behavior of holes in ladders , including their superconductivity , @xcite and the properties introduced by doping of spinless impurities .",
    "further novel physical phenomena are found in coupled spin ladders , where the magnetic structure of even - chain ladders with unfrustrated coupling , is of particular interest because the ground state is expected to be a spin liquid at sufficiently weak coupling , but to order magnetically when the interladder interactions are strong .",
    "this system realizes the conditions required to investigate the qcp , introduced by chakravarty _",
    "@xcite in the context of a nonlinear @xmath3-model description of the two - dimensional heisenberg af , and discussed extensively and more generally in refs . and . in the language of these analyses ,",
    "the interladder coupling is a parameter which tunes the system from the renormalized classical regime of long - ranged magnetic order , through the qcp to the one - dimensional limit where the spins are disordered by quantum fluctuations ( quantum disordered ) .",
    "such a structure is represented in three dimensions by the two - chain ladder compound lacuo@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite initial experimental studies gave contradictory results on the nature of the ground state , as static susceptibility measurements @xcite suggested a spin liquid state with a spin gap , while nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite and muon spin resonance ( @xmath4sr ) @xcite measurements indicated a transition to a magnetically ordered phase .",
    "in a brief study of both electronic and magnetic properties of the material , it was proposed @xcite that the conflicting observations could be reconciled if the system was located near the qcp of the transition between the two regimes , and this scenario was supported by detailed numerical simulations performed by troyer _",
    "@xcite    in this work we will analyze the properties of the system on both sides of the critical point , employing a mean - field approximation to the bond - operator technique which is generalized to the magnetically ordered regime . from the evolution of the mode structure through the transition , we may compute both the thermodynamics and the dynamical magnetic properties of the system . in the disordered phase , the excitations are triply degenerate magnons with a spin gap which vanishes on approach to the qcp . in the af ordered phase , we find that the modes evolve into two spin - wave excitations representing rotations of the ordered moment , accompanied by an amplitude mode corresponding to fluctuations in its magnitude .",
    "this latter mode has a gap which grows continuously with the moment , so it will be low - lying only near the qcp , and will develop far from the transition into a high - lying excitation which is ignored in the dynamics of a conventional af .    to characterize the ordered system close to the qcp we focus on the static susceptibility @xmath5 , which vanishes at @xmath6 on approach to the transition .",
    "the results for @xmath5 in the mean - field theory agree well both qualitatively and quantitatively by highly accurate quantum monte carlo studies carried out by troyer _",
    "@xcite both sets of calculations support the proposal that lacuo@xmath2 is indeed an af close to the qcp .",
    "we examine the dynamic structure factor to find features associated with the presence of an amplitude mode .",
    "this mode couples to neutrons in the same way as the transverse excitations , and we show that it should be observable in inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystals .",
    "raman light scattering by the magnetic excitations is also discussed , but in this case it is difficult to find signals which may be ascribed unambiguously to this mode .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we develop the bond - operator formalism for application in the ordered magnetic regime , to describe the mode structure of the magnetic excitations and the zero - temperature phase transition . in section",
    "iii we discuss briefly the statistics of the magnon excitations , in order to solve the mean - field equations at finite temperatures and to deduce the static susceptibility on both sides of the transition .",
    "we consider in section iv the dynamical magnetic properties of the system in the vicinity of the qcp , and calculate the dynamic structure factor for comparison with proposed experiments .",
    "section v contains our conclusions and a brief discussion .",
    "we begin by applying the bond - operator technique @xcite in the regime where the interladder superexchange coupling is sufficiently strong to stabilize a magnetically ordered state .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of simple af order both along and perpendicular to the ladders .",
    "however , we shall return in section iv to a recent alternative proposition , and show that this gives rise only to notational differences .",
    "following ref . , the spin degrees of freedom on each ladder rung are represented by the bond operators @xmath7 on each rung .",
    "af ordering along the ladders occurs when , in addition , one of the triplet operators has a non - zero expectation value with alternating sign .",
    "this we take to be the component @xmath8 , which may be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 contains fluctuations about the average value @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamics of these fluctuations may not be neglected , as in the treatment of the @xmath12 degree of freedom , because their dispersion is strong . with this choice of basis states , the coexistence of a finite @xmath13 with the condensed singlet @xmath14 on",
    "a rung corresponds to an af alternation along the ladder of states @xmath15 and @xmath16 of fixed , staggered moment @xmath13 , admixed with a singlet component of weight @xmath17 .    in the disordered or spin - liquid regime",
    "the three triplet modes remain degenerate and massive , a situation represented schematically in fig .",
    "the spin gap vanishes as the coupling approaches the qcp , where the three modes of the lower branch are spin - wave - like , with a linear dispersion about the wave vector of the magnetic ordering ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . in af the ordered phase",
    "there is a spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry , which by goldstone s theorem is accompanied by massless excitations .",
    "these will be two spin waves , which represent rotations , or transverse oscillations , of the finite staggered moment .",
    "the third mode corresponds to fluctuations in the amplitude of the moment ( longitudinal ) and will acquire a finite gap , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) . in a conventional af system one observes only the two spin waves , but close to the qcp the amplitude mode will also be of low energy at the zone center .",
    "the real - space axes , not to be confused with spin - space labels introduced above , are chosen with @xmath18 along the ladder direction and @xmath19 and @xmath20 the directions of interladder coupling . using the reduced unit cell @xcite in the @xmath21- and @xmath22-dimensions , but with doubling of the real - space structure in the @xmath23-direction to accommodate af ordering along the ladder , the hamiltonian of the three - dimensionally coupled system , @xmath24 after transformation to bond operators is written as @xmath25 where the terms have the following origins .",
    "@xmath26 contains the contribution from the ladder rung interactions , and also the constraint which restricts the spin states on each rung to a singlet or one of three triplets . here",
    "@xmath27 is a unit cell index and @xmath28 an index for the two types of rung in each cell . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the terms quadratic and quartic in @xmath31 operators corresponding to ladder leg interactions ; @xmath32 may not be discarded in the ordered system because it will contribute terms of order @xmath33 to the dynamics of the modes @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the quadratic and quartic contributions from the interladder coupling terms , which link rungs of the same type @xmath28 .    in the mean - field approximation the singlet expectation value @xmath37 and lagrange multiplier @xmath38",
    "are taken to be the same on all rungs @xmath39 , while the triplet expectation value @xmath40 alternates .",
    "the constraint term incorporates a reduction of @xmath41 due both to the presence of the @xmath42 term and to quadratic fluctuations of all three magnon modes .",
    "a direct coupling of the longitudinal ( @xmath8 ) fluctuations to the magnitude of @xmath41 is also relevant , and appears in the @xmath43 terms as @xmath44 the first line follows from substitution of the number operators into the constraint and the second from eq .",

    "we will consider the system at zero temperature , so that the magnon thermal occupation factors @xmath86 are unity .",
    "the full mean - field equations are @xmath87 @xmath88 and @xmath89 in which the first three terms on the right hand side of each expression constitute the classical equations , and the remaining terms the quantum corrections .",

    "however , such parameters correspond to modes which are in general all massive , as the spin - wave condition is not obeyed , and have no physical meaning in the present problem of an ordered magnet .",
    "this discontinuity between ordered and disordered regimes in an approach combining classical mean - field terms with quantum corrections has been encountered previously in similar circumstances .",
    "@xcite by the goldstone theorem , any breaking of a continuous symmetry must be accompanied by the presence of zero - energy excitations , in this case spin waves which are massless in the long - wavelength limit .",
    "we proceed by enforcing the third mean - field equation ( [ emfet ] ) classically : this is precisely the spin - wave condition eq .",
    "( [ ecvds ] ) , and serves both to ensure that the rotation modes are massless at the zone center and to fix the value of one of the three original variables .    the remaining two mean - field equations ( [ emfem],[emfes ] ) correspond to the pair solved in the disordered phase , now generalized to include finite @xmath42 .",
    "these may be combined to yield a single equation for @xmath94 as a function of @xmath95 , which as @xmath96 returns the critical point equation ( [ eztcp ] ) for @xmath84 .",
    "solution of this equation gives a weak first - order transition which may be traced in a linear expansion about @xmath84 to the fact that the small @xmath94 term acts as a cutoff in the @xmath97 summation which provides a logarithmic contribution in three dimensions .",
    "the linearized equation has the form @xmath98 which as shown in fig .",
    "2 , describes reentrant behavior of the onset of magnetic order .",
    "numerically , the value @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "2 ) where the solution at fixed @xmath100 becomes double - valued is 0.048 .",
    "the @xmath100 axis is however grossly expanded , and the reentrance occurs within the range of values of interladder coupling @xmath101 . because the first - order nature of the transition is extremely weak , we may use the formalism developed in this section to describe the features of the ordered magnetic system both qualitatively an on a quantitative basis .",
    "illustration of the zero - temperature solution for the variation of the ordered moment with the interladder coupling is deferred to the following section , where it is presented together with the solutions at finite temperatures .",
    "to compute the properties of the coupled ladder system at all temperatures , it is necessary first to discuss the statistics of the magnon excitations , which are contained in the thermal occupation function @xmath102 .",
    "@xcite the essential feature is that despite the bosonic commutation relations @xcite of the single magnon operators , these do not have conventional bosonic statistics because of the constraint ( [ ebosh0 ] ) on their number , and this has a profound effect on the thermodynamics of the system at intermediate and high temperatures . an approximate approach which gives a good account of the effects of the constrained magnon ocupation in the case of the isolated ladder ( disordered system ) was introduced by tsunetsugu and coworkers in ref . , and the reader is referred to this work for a detailed discussion . here",
    "we summarize the results of applying this treatment in the ordered magnetic regime .",
    "the following discussion is simplified by the implicit assumption of the presence of an anisotropy field stabilizing one particular spatial direction for the staggered moment , a point to which we shall return in more detail below when considering the susceptibility .",
    "this results in a small gap in the spin - wave spectrum , preventing the easy axis from reorienting in an applied field and allowing for a reduction of the energy of one of the modes . in an @xmath48-rung system ( @xmath103 unit cells ) with both rotation ( @xmath104 ) and amplitude ( @xmath105 )",

    "the zero - temperature graph is that shown already in ref . .",
    "solution of the mean - field equations at finite temperatures is marginally more complicated because the initial system of two variables may not be reduced to a single one in the same manner . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the disordered phase becomes more robust as might be expected , and a larger interladder coupling is required to stabilize magnetic order .",
    "the spin gap in the isolated ladder is found also to increase with temperature , although this rise is somewhat more linear above @xmath119 than would be given by the simplest possible formulation , @xmath120 .    in the ordered phase , the characteristic parameter varying with the coupling constant is @xmath42 , which gives the extent of staggered moment formation .",
    "this is shown in fig . 4 for the same temperatures .",
    "the ordered moment rises abruptly at the transition , with no obvious indication at any temperature of the reentrant behavior discussed in the previous section , and then less steeply thereafter .",
    "however , the logarithmic evolution of the ordered moment given in eq .",
    "( [ esdtvlp ] ) is manifest in a @xmath121-@xmath121 plot , and precludes the extraction of a power - law mean - field exponent from data within a range @xmath122 of the transition . at high values of the interladder coupling ,",
    "the ordered moment falls short of the limiting value @xmath123 as @xmath124 , showing that in the bond - operator description of the isotropic limit there remains some admixture of rung singlets with the ordered spins , a consequence of quantum fluctuations .",
    "turning now to the physical situation of a fixed interladder coupling constant at variable temperature , it is clear from fig .",
    "3 that any system will be disordered at high temperature . by solution of a pair of equations analogous to the zero - temperature critical - point equation ( [ eztcp ] ) ,",
    "this phase boundary is found in the plane of @xmath125 and @xmath100 , giving the nel temperature shown in fig .",
    "5 . because @xmath126 in this figure is measured in units of @xmath127 , it is evident that the real material lacuo@xmath2 , with a nel temperature @xcite of 117k , is located extremely close to the qcp ( in fact at @xmath128 ) .",
    "we will use for illustration the interladder coupling value @xmath129 , for which the dispersion relations have already been sketched in fig .",
    "the dispersion curves in the physical brillouin zone are now shown quantitatively in fig . 6 for this parameter choice ,",
    "at which the ordered moment has the value @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "the physical quantity most readily measurable which gives direct information about the magnetic state of a spin system is the static susceptibility @xmath5 , and for this reason it has been the subject of extensive discussions @xcite and measurements in a variety of ladder systems .",
    "@xcite the susceptibility per site is @xmath132 which from eq .",
    "( [ esfe ] ) yields in the disordered phase @xcite @xmath133 this is illustrated over a wide temperature range in fig .",
    "7(a ) , where it is clear that the interladder coupling has an effect only at low @xmath125 , while the remainder of the graph is well described by the numerical results for the isolated ladder .",
    "@xcite the situation at low temperatures is displayed in the inset , which shows that as the critical coupling is approached @xmath5 rises more rapidly with temperature .",
    "the nature of this increase may be studied by examining the function @xmath134 in which @xmath135 denotes the temperature derivative . for the a system with spin gap @xcite @xmath117 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , while for a power - law dependence @xmath138 , as might be expected in a critical regime , @xmath139 .",
    "7(b ) shows this function at low-@xmath125 for several values of the coupling constant @xmath100 , demonstrating clearly the evolution of the system with interladder coupling from a spin liquid with the spin gap @xmath140 and power @xmath141 prefactor of the isolated ladder , to a quantum critical phase in three dimensions , where @xmath142 .",
    "these results have a straightforward interpretation from the thermal excitations of a dilute gas of ( noninteracting ) triplet magnons whose dispersion is quadratic about a spin gap @xmath117 , and becomes linear as @xmath143 . at the qcp the susceptibility is due to excitations of spin waves , with temperature dependence determined only by system dimensionality .",
    "the calculation of the susceptibility in the ordered phase may proceed in one of two ways : for an ideal system with no interaction between the spins and the real - space or lattice coordinates , the ordered moment simply reorients in an applied field to be perpendicular , _",
    "i.e. _ a spin - flop transition .",
    "for a system with an easy - axis anisotropy , the spin waves acquire a mass proportional to the effective anisotropy field @xmath144 , and this allows the moment direction to remain stable under application of a parallel field . for a review of both situations see ref . .",
    "the susceptibility is computed in the zero - field limit , which may always be taken as an external field smaller than the intrinsic anisotropy energy , so we restrict our attention to the simplest case of the susceptibility contribution from normal mode excitations for the case of pinned moment direction in a parallel field .",
    "in addition to the part due to excitation of normal modes , the susceptibility in the ordered phase contains a constant part due to the presence of the finite moment , and so may be represented as @xmath145 @xmath146 is computed by analogy with the disordered phase from the free energy of the modes which may be excited , and is given by @xmath147 because this part has its leading contributions from the spin - wave modes with dispersion @xmath148 , it can be expected always to have a quadratic @xmath125 dependence at low temperatures .",
    "the component due to application of a perpendicular field is similar , but slightly more involved because the evolution of the mode @xmath149 with field is not linear for a finite gap , a point which will be illustrated below .",
    "the numerator contains also a term in @xmath150 , which is much smaller than the spin - wave contribution when the mass of the @xmath23 mode is finite , and higher - order terms which cancel at the transition .",
    "the dominant feature of the temperature dependence remains the @xmath151 part due to the spin - wave contribution , with a smaller prefactor . on averaging over the crystallite directions in a polycrystalline sample , @xmath152 .",
    "similarly , the static part in the anisotropy - pinned case may be written as @xmath153 for a polycrystalline sample , as only the transverse part has a finite value and this will be observed as an average over all crystallite orientations .",
    "@xmath154 may be computed in the bond - operator formalism by considering the additional term in the mean - field hamiltonian in the presence of a finite magnetic field @xmath155 , @xmath156 the evolution of the bond - operator modes of a ladder system with application of a magnetic field will be presented elsewhere . here",
    "we state the result that in general a field component @xmath157 acts to create an ordered moment @xmath158 in the operators @xmath159 and @xmath160 , where @xmath161 . in the presence of a finite , staggered @xmath162 , application of a small field @xmath163",
    "stabilizes a finite , staggered ordered moment @xmath164 .",

    "@xmath168 vanishes approximately in the manner of a second - order transition as the temperature is increased towards @xmath126 .",
    "when the same formalism is applied to the case of a longitudinal field , the ordered moment is @xmath169 and it is clear that @xmath170 is vanishing , so that the total @xmath171 has @xmath151 contributions only .    in fig .",
    "8 is shown the full static susceptibility @xmath5 ( [ essod ] ) for a variety of values of interladder coupling in the ordered phase , @xmath93 .",
    "the curves begin at the finite value of @xmath172 calculated in the preceding paragraphs , and their variation with temperature is approximately quadratic because @xmath173 is nearly constant at low t , particularly for values of the interladder coupling not in close proximity to the critical point . because the scale of @xmath1 is significantly smaller than that of @xmath174 , the second - order transition in @xmath173 at @xmath126 appears as a minor downward cusp .",
    "the results compare very well with highly accurate quantum monte carlo studies on very large systems by troyer _",
    "@xcite , which show the transition from spin liquid to ordered magnet occurring very close to @xmath175 , and continuous evolution of the susceptibility from an exponential form in the disordered phase to a quadratic variation at the critical point with an additive constant part which grows continuously on moving to the ordered side .",
    "quantitatively , the magnitude of the peak susceptibility is some 15% greater in the mean - field theory , and that of the constant parts approximately 20% smaller at common values of the coupling in the ordered phase .",
    "one may fit the measured static susceptibility @xcite to the form @xmath176 at low temperatures , and quadratic temperature dependence is found @xcite to give a good account of the data .",
    "the intrinsic susceptibility @xmath1 of the coupled ladder system is very difficult to extract from the constant @xmath177 , as this requires detailed knowledge of core atomic susceptibility terms , and we note only the qualitative result that all terms involved are very small , a further indication of the proximity of the system to the qcp . that the mean - field theory is in such generally good agreement with the numerical results , which for an unfrustrated spin system and with demonstrably negligible finite - size corrections can be taken to be essentially exact , is presumed to be primarily a consequence of the three - dimensionality of the ordered magnetic system .",
    "in the preceding section we have deduced that the lacuo@xmath2 system is magnetically ordered but located close to the qcp , as a result of which the transition temperature and ordered moment are small .",
    "one consequence is that the magnetic modes corresponding to fluctations in the amplitude of the ordered moment , which in a conventional magnet are high - lying and play no role in determining the low - energy properties of the system , should have only a small mass here . in this section",
    "we study the dynamic magnetic properties of such a system to isolate those features due to the presence of the amplitude mode and predict the ways in which these may be identified definitively by experiment .",
    "we focus directly on the dynamic structure factor measured by neutron scattering , which may be written following ref . in the form",

    "are partially factorized , and each expectation value can be separated into a constant part , corresponding to elastic scattering , and a time - dependent part responsible for inelastic processes .",
    "we consider first the elastic magnetic component , in order to isolate those bragg peaks with the highest intensity about which one may measure the dynamical structure factor most readily , and also to discuss the nature of the magnetically ordered state . in ref .",
    "it was assumed that the interladder coupling in lacuo@xmath2 was af .",
    "this assumption was made on the basis that ferromagnetic coupling , which relies on hund s rule coupling between orbitals on an atom in the superexchange path , is generally weaker than af coupling energy scales , and that because the system is one of low symmetry is was likely that the latter would have appreciable components on certain paths .",
    "in fact this assumption was not tested in detail , and the tight - binding fit to the local density approximation ( lda ) bandstructure was made using a single wannier orbital on each cu site , which was taken to be a mixture ( due to the low symmetry ) of cu 3@xmath185- and 3@xmath186-centred orbitals in the pyramidal cuo@xmath187 system . the good agreement obtained with this procedure appeared to justify the assumptions made , but did not rule out alternative parameter combinations .",
    "the results of the preceding section of this work provide a more reliable means of estimating the magnitude of the interladder coupling . recently",

    "11 , and as stated above is found to consist of a series of peaks at the dispersion relations of all magnon branches . a small broadening is inserted by hand in the calculation . in the disordered system ( fig .",
    "11(a ) ) there are four triply degenerate branches in the physical unit cell , and the lowest of these has a gap at the bottom of its band ( @xmath224 ) , as required for a spin liquid . in the ordered system ( fig .",
    "11(b ) ) , this gap has vanished , and branches are split into their @xmath3 and @xmath23 components . in the lowest - lying branch , the intensity of the spin - wave peak diverges as @xmath225 and the magnetic bragg peak is approached , while the corresponding @xmath23 mode appears at the energy @xmath226 at the chosen value of interladder coupling .",
    "this energy splitting is expected to be resolvable , and so the amplitude mode should be detected as a neighboring peak , or at least as a significant shoulder to the elastic peak , and to each of the dispersion branches .",
    "the component @xmath220 for two - magnon scattering and pair creation has an intensity between one and two orders of magnitude lower than that from magnon creation , and so will be barely detectable . because inelastic neutron scattering couples directly to the one - magnon process , it is the best technique to observe a clear signature of the low - lying amplitude mode .",
    "we have considered also the expected form of the intensity @xmath227 in a raman light scattering experiment on the magnetically ordered but nearly critical system .",
    "unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the amplitude mode , as in the magnon creation signal expected in the neutron scattering cross section , would be provided by one - magnon processes with a significant weight . following fleury and loudon ,",
    "@xcite it is clear that in this system neither the magnetic - dipole nor electric - dipole first - order interactions detailed by these authors can provide appreciable signals .",
    "concluding for completeness with second - order light scattering , we have computed the @xmath228 correlation function which gives the intensity in a spin - only model .",
    "@xcite we find a `` 3@xmath229 '' peak due to scattering of zone - boundary magnons in the ladder ( @xmath230 ) direction , and that this peak is broadened in the presence of an amplitude mode split off from the spin wave band in an af system close to the qcp .",
    "however , mindful of the facts that measured spectra are not fully explained by two - magnon scattering considerations , and that these are found to be anomalously broad in other cuprate materials , we conclude that raman scattering is unlikely to be a suitable probe of the dynamics of the amplitude mode .",
    "we have presented a theoretical description of the three - dimensionally coupled spin ladder system which is realized in the insulating compound lacuo@xmath2 .",
    "this spin configuration is such that for weak interladder magnetic coupling the ground state is the spin - liquid phase characteristic of the isolated ladder , while for larger coupling values an unfrustrated , magnetically ordered state is expected .",
    "we employ a representation based on singlet and triplet bond operators on each rung of the ladders to obtain a uniform description of both phases within the same framework .    within the mean - field approach to the bond - operator formalism , solution at zero temperature",
    "gives the interladder coupling at the qcp as @xmath231 .",
    "the transition is found to be very weakly first order , and the increase of the ordered moment to be logarithmic in the coupling ratio @xmath232 in the vicinity of the transition , with the mean - field exponent recovered at higher @xmath100 .",
    "finite - temperature solutions are obtained by incorporating the constraint on the triplet excited states into an effective magnon statistics , and show the increase with temperature of the disordered regime and the critical coupling , allowing the deduction of the nel temperature .",
    "the real material has an ordering temperature extremely small on the scale of the superexchange parameter @xmath229 within the ladders , implying that it is located very close to the qcp on the ordered side . in this case",
    "the magnon mode corresponding to amplitude fluctuations of the ordered moment has only a small gap at the bottom of its band , and will contribute to the low - energy dynamic and thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "the constant part of the static susceptibility is proportional to the square of the ordered moment and is small , reconciling measured susceptibility data with the fact that the system is ordered .",
    "the part of the static susceptibility due to thermal excitation of modes of the system increases quadratically with temperature for spin waves in three dimensions .",
    "the results of the mean - field theory are supported by comparison with the detailed quantum monte carlo studies of troyer _ et al .",
    "we have demonstrated that the low - lying amplitude mode , which is unique to this type of af , contributes to the dynamical response function .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering is an especially suitable probe for investigating this mode as it may access one - magnon excitation processes , and we have presented an explicit calculation of its effects for comparison with experiment .    in closing , for a system so close to the qcp we may speculate on ways of controlling the tuning parameter represented by the interladder coupling in order to pass through the transition . as discussed in the preceding section ,",
    "the superexchange processes contributing to the interladder magnetic interaction are not well understood , but the coupling is known to be a decreasing function of the bond angle away from 180@xmath233",
    ". it may be possible by application of hydrostatic pressure , or better uniaxial pressure along the @xmath21- or @xmath22-axis of a single crystal , to cause an alteration of this bond angle significant enough to measure , at least as a raising or lowering of @xmath126 as deduced from @xmath234 by nmr .",
    "as an alternative to physical pressure it is possible @xcite also to apply chemical pressure by substituting other trivalent atoms for la . in lacuo@xmath2 the bond angle is found to increase on substitution of y for la , while it is decreased in equal amount by substitution of nd .",
    "we await with interest more detailed results on the evolution of the magnetic state , which may provide evidence of the system being moved through the qcp .",
    "however , for a random distribution of substituents there will be a random distribution of local distortions , from which one may deduce only an average value for the bond angle and interladder coupling , so that interpretation within the above framework will be less transparent .",
    "finally , as we have shown in the preceding sections , the changes in many bulk quantities across the quantum critical regime remain essentially smooth , and it will be necessary to adopt a criterion based on the appearance of the staggered moment or the associated massive mode for unambiguous identification of the transition point .",
