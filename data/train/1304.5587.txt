    "in digital image restoration the primary task is to remove noise without changing the multiscale nature of images .",
    "there exists various methods for image denoising and variational - partial differential equations ( pde ) based schemes  @xcite are powerful methods in this regard . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on anisotropic pde based color image denoising and study how we can improve them by introducing color edges into the diffusion process .",
    "perona and malik  @xcite proposed a nonlinear diffusion function to control the smoothing across edges for monochromatic images . due to the efficient denoising property of such class of pdes , recently there are efforts  @xcite to introduce them into color image denoising as well .",
    "tschumperl and deriche  @xcite studied such diffusion pdes in one common framework and unified them under vector valued regularization .",
    "the main drawback of the current schemes is that they can introduce color smearing across multi - edges . therefore low to medium contrast color edges are not preserved and the resultant image lacks clear color boundaries that are present in the original scene , see figure  [ i : bug ] .",
    "to avoid such artifacts we make use of chromatic edges found in different channels into the vector valued regularization of  @xcite .",
    "it is known that  @xcite the geometry of a color image is contained entirely in the base intensity image .",
    "a weighted coupling is introduced to align and constraint the gradient responses of different color channels and the weights are computed from the input image .",
    "thus , we make of use of not only the geometry but also the color information explicitly into the diffusion paradigm .    we introduce a color edge strength function via the coupling term into the vector valued regularization scheme .",
    "this function can be added to any of the other schemes mentioned as well and hence the proposed term can be utilized depending upon requirements . in this letter",
    "we consider denoising color images only , so a vector valued regularization based diffusion scheme is used .",
    "apart from comparing our scheme with traditional diffusion based schemes  @xcite we also compare our scheme with other coupling term based formulations  @xcite proposed in the past .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ prop ] introduces the proposed scheme based on the vector valued diffusion model .",
    "denoising results are presented in section  [ deno ] , and section  [ concl ] concludes the paper .",
    "let @xmath0 with @xmath1 represent a color image in red , green , and blue ( rgb ) space . given a noisy color image @xmath2 , the diffusion pde of the following form , @xmath3 which is iteratively applied starting with the initial value @xmath4 .",
    "the diffusion matrix @xmath5 is important in noise removal and is defined in terms of image gradients , see  @xcite for a review .",
    "tschumperl and deriche ( td ) in their work on vector valued image regularization  @xcite unified such diffusion pdes in one common trace based framework , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hessian matrix of the vector component @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the tensor field defined point wise which we describe next .",
    "consider the smoothed multigradient , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the gaussian kernel , @xmath12 denotes the convolution operation and superscript @xmath13 the transpose .",
    "let the eigenvalues of @xmath14 be @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and their corresponding eigenvectors be @xmath17 , @xmath18 . if we let @xmath19 which acts as an edge indicator in vector images , see for example figure  [ i : chro](a ) .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 . due to the use of multigradient @xmath23 and its eigenvectors , the overall geometry of the input vector image @xmath24 is captured .",
    "also , the channel coupling is implicitly integrated into the scheme by the eigenvalues in @xmath25 . still smearing can occur near color edges which are not captured completely by the eigen decomposition of the multi - gradient @xmath23 , see figure  [ i : chro ] bottom row .",
    "this can be attributed to the strong _",
    "chromatic edges _ which are specific to one channel and may or may not give a strong gradient response in other channels .      following  @xcite , to control the color smearing we incorporate chromatic edges into the regularized pde   via weighted laplacian computed from all three color channels . for this purpose",
    "we consider a coupling term of the form , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the laplacian and the @xmath28 are the weight corresponding to channel @xmath29 to be modeled next .",
    "the above equation facilitates an explicit coupling between different color channels and chromatic edges specific from each of the channel is adjusted to align themselves .",
    "the weights @xmath28 are added to adjust the magnitude of chromatic edges so as to avoid data mixup artifacts when computing the vectorial diffusion . in this letter , we choose the weights using the scalar total variation ( tv ) pde  @xcite , @xmath30 applied channel - wise starting with the initial value @xmath31 , then the weights are set to , @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the weights adjusts chromatic edges in terms of magnitude of gradients and aligns different channel edges via laplacian differences in eqn .  .",
    "the pre - smoothing with gaussian @xmath34 is added to remove small oscillations which can occur due to the application of tv as well as to avoid outliers in gradient computations .",
    "figure  [ i : chro ] shows the importance of the chromatic edges of the image figure  [ i : bug](a ) .",
    "thus , the scheme we propose takes the following form @xmath35 note that the weighted coupling term   can be added to any of the vector diffusion pdes based on perona - malik diffusion term  @xcite or in general to any diffusion pde which computes intra - channel smoothing .",
    "the pre - smoothing parameter @xmath36 can be chosen according to the amount of noise present in the input image .",
    "if @xmath36 is chosen very big , we lose the small scale chromatic edges .",
    "similarly , the number of iterations to run the tv pde depends on the noise level , and can be fixed a priori which could work for a class of images . by incorporating the weighted laplacian differences between different channels we align the high frequency content while denoising with vector diffusion pde .",
    "figure  [ i : chro](b ) shows the chromatic edges found by the total coupling term @xmath37 along with canny edge detector based result in figure  [ i : chro](c ) for comparison .",
    "other choices for the weight are possible , we chose the smoothed gradients as it gives a road - map to adjust and match the magnitudes of edges .",
    "all the images are normalized to the range @xmath38 $ ] and we implement   by standard finite difference scheme .",
    "the algorithm is visualized in matlab 7.8(r2009a ) on a 64-bit windows laptop with 3 gb ram , 2.20ghz . for the tv pde based smoothed weights computation   split - bregman fast iteration scheme  @xcite is utilized ( @xmath39 _ sec _ for @xmath40 iterations for @xmath41 channels ) .",
    "the pre - smoothing parameter in   and in the multigradient @xmath14 is set to @xmath42@xmath43 and the tv pde is run for a fixed @xmath40 iterations in all the examples reported here .",
    "the computational time depends on the number of iterations of the main pde   and for a @xmath44 rgb color image it takes less than a minute .",
    "the first example in figure  [ i : bab ] compares the denoising result of a close - up @xmath45 color image with the original vectorial diffusion td  @xcite scheme . the noisy image given in figure  [ i : bab](a )",
    "is obtained by adding additive gaussian noise of @xmath46 to the three color channels ( r , g , b ) separately . by comparing figure  [ i : bab](b ) with figure  [ i : bab](c )",
    "we see that the proposed modified scheme preserves edges without color smearing near edges as well as avoids chromatic noise , see the contour maps in the middle .",
    "next we compare the performance of the proposed scheme   with the following schemes : anisotropic diffusion ( pm , using finite differences )  @xcite , beltrami flow ( kms , finite differences )  @xcite , generalized chromatic diffusion ( bft , finite differences )  @xcite which is an improvement over the chromatic diffusion scheme ( tsc )  @xcite , variational regularization ( bks , gradient descent with finite differences )  @xcite , vector valued regularization of ( td )  @xcite , vectorial tv ( bc , dual minimization ] )  @xcite , perona and malik with a coupling term  @xcite ( ps , finite differences ) .",
    "figure  [ i : pepc ] shows a comparison of the schemes output with our scheme result on a closeup ( size @xmath47 ) of noisy @xmath48 test image with @xmath49 . as can be seen from the images , by visual comparison ,",
    "color smearing artifacts appear near the chromatic edges in pm , bft and kms scheme results due to wrong channel mixing and diffusion transfer . on the other hand bks and bc scheme suffer from staircasing artifacts in flat regions .",
    "the parameters involved in these schemes were chosen according to maximum peak signal - to - noise ratio ( psnr ) value .",
    "psnr for an estimated 3-dimensional color image @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean squared error with @xmath24 the original noise - free image , @xmath53 is the dimension of the image domain @xmath54 . to further assess the performance of different schemes we utilize the mean structural similarity ( mssim )  @xcite which is better suited than that of psnr in terms finding the structure preservation  ] .",
    "figure  [ i : bab](b ) & ( c ) top right part shows the combined ssim map of the restored results for the td and our scheme .",
    "finally , table  [ t : psnr ] & table  [ t : mssim ] compare the psnr and mssim values achieved by various regularization and pde based schemes on standard data set of natural color images of size @xmath55 and @xmath44 , we show results for @xmath56 images and the remaining results , data - sets , denoised images are available at figshare and multispectral extension of the proposed scheme is straightforward .",
    "we conclude that the proposed chromatic edges based vectorial diffusion scheme performs better than other diffusion schemes and further improves color enhancement property of eqn .   with multi - edge preservation .",
    "note that , for images with fine scale textures ( see entries for @xmath57 , @xmath58 in table  [ t : mssim ] ) our scheme has slightly lesser mssim values than td scheme since capturing color textures are much harder than strong chromatic discontinuities .",
    "extensions of the proposed denoising scheme for other videos  @xcite , image decomposition  @xcite and demosaicking  @xcite can also be considered .",
