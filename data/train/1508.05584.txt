    "in the basis of the pulse - area theorem  @xcite , `` simple '' zero - area pulses make no net transition , leaving the two - state system intact .",

    "since the experiment was performed under the condition of non - uniform spatial profiles of the laser pulse and the atom cloud , the calculation took into account the spatial averaging effect  @xcite , where @xmath205 in the @xmath0-axis denotes the maximum of the gaussian distribution of @xmath148 .",
    "the measured populations were calibrated to probabilities by using the first peak of rabi oscillations as a reference .",
    "within the available measurement region , the experimental result shows that the dark cpr region is surrounded by the bright cpi region , in a good agreement with the theoretical calculation .",
    "in addition , we probed the effect of the width of the spectral hole .",
    "the frequency chirp was fixed at @xmath206  fs@xmath86 , and the spectral hole was varied from 200 to 1000  ghz ( fwhm ) . in fig .",
    "[ figq](c ) , the measured pulse energies ( shown with squares ) for the first cpi peaks are displayed in comparison with the corresponding numerical calculation ( dots ) .",
    "we now consider possible applications of the chirped zero - area excitation implicated from the results obtained in this study .",
    "since the two - state system interacting with the chirped zero - area pulse can undergo , amid the adiabatic evolution ( @xmath1-rotation ) by the main pulse , rabi - like oscillation due to the non - adiabatic interaction by the hole pulse , an interplay between rabi - like oscillations and adiabatic evolutions can be made by shaping the spectral width and position of the hole .",
    "this approach can be a powerful and alternative control means in selective excitation of , in particular , multi - state systems . in a @xmath207-type system",
    "@xcite of 5s@xmath186 , 5p@xmath186 , and 5p@xmath208 in rubidium , for example , a numerical simulation ( not shown ) with chirped zero - area pulses results in over 97% population of the system driven to either excited states , by simply changing the pulse intensity only .",
    "also , this control method implicates that the laser spatial profile is also useful for position - dependent selective excitations , which can be applied to , for example , atom or ion qubits in spatial arrangements  @xcite .",
    "we have presented our theoretical and experimental investigation of the two - state system dynamics under the interaction of chirped zero - area pulses . in experiments , we used femto - second laser pulses of which the resonant spectral component was removed and then the pulses were spectrally chirped . these chirped zero - area pulses drove coherent excitations of the resonant 5s@xmath186 - 5p@xmath186 transition of rubidium atoms that were tightly confined in a mot within a fraction of the laser spatial profile to ensure uniform laser - atom interactions .",
    "the interplay between the adiabatic evolution and rabi - like oscillations , both of which were simultaneously induced by the chirped zero - area pulses , has been probed .",
    "we have shown that the given dynamics can be modeled to the ramsey - type three - pulse interaction , in a good agreement with the experimental results .",
    "the underlying mechanism behind the observed coherent dynamics can be understood based on the nature of the chirped zero - area pulse : the chirped zero - area pulse is a sum of two pulses with different bandwidths , and the broad - band pulse ( the main pulse ) makes adiabatic evolution even by a small amount of chirp .",
    "however , the narrow - band pulse ( the hole pulse ) makes either adiabatic or non - adiabatic evolution ( thus rabi oscillation ) . as a result , the latter switches on or off a rabi transition amid the adiabatic evolution induced by the former .",
    "the result suggests a new design scheme of laser pulse shaping towards selective excitation in multi - state atoms , by embedding a rabi - like oscillation in adiabatic evolutions .",
