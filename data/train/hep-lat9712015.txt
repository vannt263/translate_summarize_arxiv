    "of particular interest is its application in gauge theories with fermions .",
    "the atiyah - singer index theorem relates the topological charge @xmath2 $ ] of a sufficiently smooth gauge field configuration @xmath3 to the index of the dirac operator on some compact manifold ( or for gauge fields with suitable boundary conditions ) .",
    "the index of the operator can be expressed as the difference of the number of ( lineraly independent ) negative ( @xmath4 ) and positive ( @xmath5 ) chirality zero modes .",
    "the zero modes are eigenstates of the dirac operator with eigenvalue @xmath6 . since @xmath7 anti - commutes with @xmath8 , the zero modes can be chosen as eigenstates @xmath9 of @xmath7 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "unfortunately , the gauge fields carrying the measure of the continuum path integral do not obey the necessary smoothnes condition @xcite for the index theorem to apply in the fully quantized theory .",
    "the application of the index theorem is thus restricted to semiclassical arguments .    on the lattice",
    "the situation is different .",
    "it is possible to assign a topological charge to all gauge field configurations ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review ) , up to so - called exceptional configurations which do not contribute in the continuum limit .",
    "the lattice path integral for the gauge fields thus effectively can be decomposed into topological sectors",
    ". certainly it would be valuable to be able to understand the behavior of fermionic observables in each sector .",
    "unfortunately there is no analytic result for an index theorem on the lattice .",
    "however , many contributions can be found in the literature @xcite - @xcite , where a probabilistic manifestation of the atiyah - singer index theorem on the lattice and its consequences are discussed .",
    "the pioneering papers @xcite investigated the manifestation of the index theorem on the lattice by analyzing the pseudoscalar density operator which through chiral ward identities can be related to the topological charge . in two interesting papers by smit and vink @xcite these relations were extended to a lattice version of the witten - veneziano formula for the pseudoscalar masses . in two numerical studies @xcite the interplay between pseudoscalar density operators and the topological charge",
    "was further investigated for two - dimensional models .",
    "complete spectra of the wilson - dirac operator for non - abelian gauge fields first appeared in @xcite .",
    "an important step in understanding the manifestation of the index theorem on the lattice was to realize @xcite that the eigenvectors of the lattice dirac operator with _",
    "eigenvalues should be interpreted as the lattice counterparts of the continuum zero modes .",
    "this result can best be understood @xcite by using the fact that for the wilson - dirac operator only eigenvectors @xmath15 with real eigenvalues can have non - vanishing pseudoscalar matrix elements @xmath16 , similar to the zero modes in the continuum .",
    "it was furthermore realized @xcite , that only real eigenvalues of @xmath17 can give rise to exact zero eigenvalues for properly chosen bare mass . as is explicitly shown in @xcite",
    "this can be used to compute the topological charge by counting the level crossings of the eigenvalues of the numerically simpler hermitian operator @xmath18 as the bare quark mass is varied .",
    "this method was later reassessed in the framework of the overlap formalism @xcite .",
    "the procedure was successfully applied to study the interplay between topological charge and the spectrum of @xmath18 in su(@xmath19 ) gauge theories in various settings including 2d models @xcite as well as static and thermalized configurations for su(2 ) and su(3 ) @xcite . in the last reference in @xcite the index theorem",
    "is tested using the overlap framework for smooth abelian subgroup configurations of su(2 ) , for lattice discretizations of instantons and for a cooled configuration .",
    "after the interest in the subject had been revived by the work of the overlap collaborators @xcite the last two years saw a wealth of of new articles .",
    "low lying eigenvalues as well as complete spectra of the staggered fermion matrix were computed in @xcite and their distribution was successfully compared to the prediction of random matrix theory @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was attempted to resolve the problem of exceptional configurations in quenched simulations by shifting the poles of the propagator due to zero modes .",
    "studies of the behavior of fermionic observables in topologically non - trivial gauge field configurations can be found in @xcite .",
    "results for the spectrum in classical configurations were reported in @xcite and in @xcite studies in qed@xmath0 with dynamical fermions were performed . a detailed analysis of the lattice zero modes and their localization properties for the modified operators @xmath18 is given in @xcite .",
    "+ in this article we directly investigate properties of the _ unmodified _ wilson - dirac operator . in particular we compute complete spectra of the original wilson - dirac operator in sets of background configurations with known topological charge .",
    "the features of the spectrum which are due to the topology of the background field are analyzed .",
    "we show the stability of these features under adding fluctuations to the gauge fields thus demonstrating their topological nature .",
    "the behavior of the spectrum in a fully quantized theory is discussed using qed@xmath0 as an example .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we collect some known symmetry properties of the wilson - dirac operator and review the special role of the real eigenvalues .",
    "this is followed by section 3 where we construct simple gauge field configurations to be used for numerically testing the lattice index theorem ( section 3.1 ) and discuss the numerics ( section 3.2 ) . in section 4.1",
    "we present our numerical results for smooth gauge field configurations , section 4.2 contains the results for rough configurations and in section 4.3 we perform a stability analysis of the topological features of the spectrum .",
    "section 5 discusses the role of the index theorem in a fully quantized lattice gauge theory using qed@xmath0 as an example .",
    "the article closes with a discussion of the results and further perspectives ( section 6 ) .",

    "lattice sites are denoted as @xmath23 .",
    "the lattice spacing is set equal to 1 .",
    "we write the fermion matrix @xmath24 as @xmath25 with hopping parameter @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the bare quark mass . due to this simple relation between @xmath24 and @xmath28 , in the following we will concentrate on the analysis of the hopping matrix @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the hopping parameter , and the hopping matrix @xmath28 is defined as ( spinor and color indices suppressed ) @xmath30 for the @xmath31-matrices we use the chiral representation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the matrix anti - commuting with @xmath32 is denoted as @xmath7 for both @xmath20 . in order to ensure reflection positivity ,",
    "the fermions obey mixed boundary conditions , i.e.  periodic in @xmath33-direction , @xmath34 , and anti - periodic in @xmath35-direction .",
    "this is taken into account by the mixed periodic kronecker delta @xmath36 which is the usual @xmath17-dimensional kronecker delta , but with an extra minus sign for the links from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath39 are group elements ( u(1 ) for @xmath40 and su(@xmath19 ) for @xmath41 ) assigned to the links between nearest neighbors @xmath42 .",

    "the norm @xmath62 is defined to be the @xmath63 norm obtained by summing over all lattice , spinor and color indices and @xmath64 is some ( spinor ) test function on the lattice .",
    "using the triangle inequality one ends up with @xmath65 .",
    "this bound implies for an eigenvalue @xmath66 of the hopping matrix @xmath28 ( the corresponding normalized eigenvector is denoted as @xmath67 ) @xmath68 .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of @xmath28 are confined within a circle of radius @xmath69 around the origin in the complex plane .",
    "it follows from the symmetries ( [ simtra ] ) that the spectrum of @xmath28 is symmetric with respect to reflection at both , the real and the imaginary axis .",

    "corresponding to corners of the brillouin zone different from @xmath84 , obey a simple pattern governed by the topological charge of the gauge field configuration : the right hand side of ( [ lasit ] ) simply has to be multiplied by a factor corresponding to the degeneracy of the corresponding corner of the brillouin zone ( e.g.  4 for the @xmath85-type corners , 6 for the @xmath86-type corners etc . ) and an extra minus sign for each @xmath87 in the coordinate of the corner ( compare table 1 , fig .  [ schempic ] and the discussion in section 4 ) .",
    "( [ lasit ] ) is expected to hold for configurations with plaquette elements sufficiently close to 1 , such that exceptional configurations are avoided .",
    "we remark that when analyzing the manifestation of the index theorem on the lattice the existence of eq .",
    "( [ chirlat ] ) and its interpretation ( [ lasit ] ) makes the wilson formulation more convenient compared to the staggered form of the fermion matrix .",
    "the latter formulation gives rise to an anti - hermitian matrix with only purely imaginary eigenvalues and thus lacks a natural criterion to identify the lattice equivalents of the zero modes .",
    "in order to test the form ( [ lasit ] ) of the atiyah - singer index theorem on the lattice , one has to compare the number of the real eigenvalues to the topological charge of the gauge field configuration . for this enterprise",
    "it is necessary to use a definition of the topological charge independent from the dirac operator , such as the geometric definition @xcite .",
    "however , although conceptionally most satisfying , the geometric definition is rather costly to evaluate for @xmath88 with gauge group su(@xmath19 ) @xcite . for a first analysis of ( [ lasit ] ) in @xmath88 we use sets of topologically non - trivial su(2 ) gauge field configurations with",

    "we remark that the spectrum of the hopping matrix @xmath28 does not depend on the choice of @xmath90 , as can be seen from a hopping expansion of its characteristic polynomial .",
    "@xmath91 are integers .",
    "we generalized the configurations given in @xcite by introducing constant phases @xmath92 which leave the topological charge invariant , but allow for a wider range of simple configurations where we can check the index theorem ( [ lasit ] ) .",
    "for the configurations ( [ smoothu ] ) the plaquette elements @xmath93 are constant with @xmath94 , @xmath95 and all other plaquettes @xmath96 .",

    "the fields ( [ smoothu ] ) are maximally smooth ( in terms of their plaquettes ) .",
    "however small fluctuations around the fields ( [ smoothu ] ) should leave the topological charge and the properties of @xmath28 which depend on it ( number of real eigenvalues , chiral properties of the eigenvectors ) invariant . for large enough @xmath54 and small enough fluctuations the invariance of",
    "the ( geometric ) topological charge is an exact result : lscher @xcite gives the ( non - optimal ) bound tr@xmath101 < 0.03 $ ] for a su(2 ) configuration to be non - exceptional ( i.e. the configuration can be assigned a topological charge ; in the work of phillips and stone @xcite a similar bound is given ) . in order to change the topological sector , the gauge fields have to go through an exceptional configuration .",
    "thus if the fluctuations are small enough , the topological charge remains invariant .    in order to analyze configurations fluctuating around ( [ smoothu ] )",
    "we define new link variables @xmath102 where the smooth link variables @xmath103 are given by ( [ smoothu ] ) , and the fluctuations @xmath104 are su(2 ) elements in the vicinity of 1 , defined as ( @xmath105 denote the pauli matrices ) @xmath106 where @xmath107 are sets of small random numbers with @xmath108 the size of the fluctuations is bounded by @xmath109 and in the limit @xmath110 we have @xmath111 . in the numerical analysis",
    "described below , we will use values @xmath112 and 0.3 and apply the roughening procedure ( [ roughu ] ) several times ( @xmath113 times ) .",
    "certainly the gauge field action increases with roughening .",
    "we found , that when applying several runs of the roughening procedure with different values of @xmath109 , the average values of the action plotted as a function of @xmath114 lie on a universal curve .",
    "the roughening procedure thus behaves like a directed random walk towards higher values of the action .    in order to avoid confusion",
    ", we finally remark that the configurations ( [ smoothu ] ) , ( [ roughu ] ) do not dominate the path integral of lattice gauge theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "they are merely a convenient tool to analyze the spectrum in gauge field configurations with known topological charge .",
    "computing all eigenvalues of the fermion matrix and some of the eigenvectors is a challenging problem already for rather small , four - dimensional lattices .",
    "the fermion matrix for su(@xmath19 ) has size @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "studying e.g.  su(2 ) on a @xmath115 lattice means diagonalizing and computing eigenvectors for a @xmath116 complex matrix .",
    "storing the whole matrix in double precision requires already 64 mb of memory . doubling the lattice size increases @xmath117 by a factor of 16 , and the required memory by a factor of 256 .",
    "thus the memory requirements restrict one to rather small lattices .",
    "in particular we studied the spectrum for su(2 ) gauge fields on lattices of size 4@xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "we remark that for hermitian matrices there exists a method with modest storage requirements : the lanczos method without reorthogonalization @xcite .",
    "it was successfully used by e.g.  kalkreuter and simma @xcite to diagonalize the hermitian operator @xmath120 .",
    "unfortunately , for the unchanged , non - hermitian wilson - dirac matrix @xmath24 ( or @xmath28 respectively ) the situation is less suitable for the lanczos method without reorthogonalization .",
    "barbour et al .",
    "@xcite report that they were not able to compute all the eigenvalues and they were forced to reorthogonalize . in that case , the lanczos vectors have to be stored and storage requirements become comparable with standard methods .",
    "another typical problem for the lanczos method without reorthogonalization is that the eigenvalues come with wrong multiplicities @xcite .",
    "since the exact number of degenerate eigenvalues is essential for our investigation , the use of standard routines for general complex matrices from the lapack package turned out to be the best choice : @xmath28 was first diagonalized ( using lapack routines zgehrd , zhseqr ) and then eigenvectors for particular eigenvalues were computed using zhsein and zunmhr .",
    "computing the spectrum ( without eigenvectors ) for the @xmath115 lattice takes typically 4 hours of computer - time on a mips r10000 cpu at 180 mhz .",
    "the time for the computation of a single eigenvector to a given eigenvalue is only several seconds .",
    "our investigation requires the distinction between real eigenvalues and eigenvalues with non - vanishing imaginary part . for some of the gauge field configurations we encountered complex eigenvalues with rather small imaginary parts of order @xmath121 but there was never a problem distinguishing them from truly real eigenvalues , which in the numerical computation have imaginary parts smaller than @xmath122 and do not have a complex conjugate partner .",
    "a second criterion to distinguish the eigenvalues is of course the pseudoscalar matrix element of the corresponding eigenvectors , which is of order 1 for real eigenvalues , but of order @xmath123 for eigenvalues with non - vanishing imaginary part .",
    "there are several ways to test the correctness and accuracy of the programs .",
    "a first check we performed is comparing the numerical result for the trivial case ( all link variables = 1 ) to the analytic result for the spectrum obtained by fourier transformation .",
    "our diagonalization routine reproduces the analytic result with an accuracy of @xmath124 .    a more advanced test makes use of results known from the hopping expansion ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "using the fact , that @xmath125 are proportional to projectors , one can show , that tr@xmath126 is proportional to the sum over traces over products of links ordered along non - backtracking , closed paths of length @xmath127 .",
    "in particular @xmath128 when some of the sides of the lattice @xmath44 or @xmath45 have length 4 , tr@xmath129 has some extra terms due to loops around the boundary .",
    "sums over odd powers of eigenvalues @xmath130 vanish trivially , since eigenvalues come always in pairs @xmath66 and @xmath131 ( compare ( [ simtra ] ) ) .",
    "we checked the quadratic and quartic sum rules , and found that they are obeyed with an accuracy of @xmath132 for all spectra we analyzed .",
    "we remark , that from the hopping expansion it is also obvious that the spectrum of the wilson - dirac operator is gauge invariant : the characteristic polynomial @xmath133 has a hopping expansion in terms of tr@xmath126 .",
    "each of these contributions is a sum over traces of closed loops of link variables and thus gauge invariant .",
    "this implies gauge invariance of the characteristic polynomial and thus of the spectrum .",
    "an alternative argument for the gauge invariance of the spectrum is to use the fact that the wilson - dirac operator transforms in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , and thus the eigenvalues remain invariant ( the eigenvectors transform in the fundamental representation ) .",
    "we start presenting our numerical results with the discussion of the spectrum for the smooth fields ( [ smoothu ] ) .",

    "[ nu0spect ] it is obvious , that in the close vicinity of the real eigenvalues there cluster several complex eigenvalues .",
    "these complex eigenvalues have nothing to do with zero modes , since their pseudoscalar matrix elements vanish identically ( @xmath164 in our numerical analysis ) , while the matrix elements for the real eigenvalues are of order 1 .",
    "we remark , that increasing the size of one of the lattice sides to 6 does not affect the structure of the spectrum .",
    "for all sufficiently smooth configurations we analyzed , the lattice version ( [ lasit ] ) of the index theorem was confirmed , clearly demonstrating that the structure of the real eigenvalues is the part of the spectrum which remains invariant within the topological sectors .      in this section",
    "we present results from the analysis of the spectra for a whole sample of roughened gauge fields .",
    "this serves to demonstrate that the topological features of the spectrum are stable for a set of rough configurations ( [ roughu ] ) fluctuating around the smooth configurations ( [ smoothu ] ) .",
    "in particular we analyzed the spectra for roughened gauge field configurations starting from the smooth configuration with @xmath165 .",
    "we then applied @xmath113 steps of the roughening procedure each with @xmath112 .",
    "for all together 15 values of @xmath113 in the range of @xmath166 to @xmath167 we computed spectra for 30 configurations at each @xmath113 . for each sample of 30 spectra",
    "( at fixed @xmath113 ) we analyzed the topological features of the eigenvalues : the smooth configuration with @xmath168 has all together 32 real eigenvalues , distributed among the branches as @xmath169 .",
    "the configuration has @xmath153 , and thus according to ( [ lasit ] ) the quoted numbers are the _ minimal _ amount of real eigenvalues in each branch . in order to be compatible with ( [ lasit ] ) there is always the possibility that there are more real eigenvalues in a branch , but with different chirality of the corresponding eigenvectors , such that the difference of left- and right - handed contributions gives the numbers 2,8,12,8,2 for the branches .",
    "however , any spectrum with less than 32 real eigenvalues clearly violates ( [ lasit ] ) . in almost all cases we analyzed ,",
    "the breakdown of ( [ lasit ] ) was signalized by such a drop of the number of real eigenvalues below 32 . for the following discussion",
    "we adopt as our criterion for a breakdown of ( [ lasit ] ) a violation of @xmath170 we define the probability function @xmath171 to be the probability of finding ( [ viocrit ] ) correct , and compute it for each sample of 30 spectra at fixed @xmath113 . fig .",
    "[ stabiplot ] shows the probability @xmath171 ( circles , scale on the left vertical axis ) for different values of @xmath113 . in the figure we also display the average value of the gauge field action per plaquette @xmath172 ( diamonds , right vertical scale ) .",
    "= 2.7 in    the figure shows nicely , that there is a rather large number of roughening steps where the topological structure of the spectrum remains unperturbed , i.e. @xmath173 ( from @xmath174 to @xmath175 ) . during these roughening steps the action per plaquette @xmath172 increases ( starting with a value of 0.1 at @xmath174 ) roughly by a factor of 25 which demonstrates the stability of the topological structure in more physical units . then after 22 roughening steps the probability @xmath176 for the index theorem ( [ lasit ] ) to hold drops sharply reaching a level of @xmath177 at @xmath178 . under",
    "further roughening the probability function keeps fluctuating around this value .",
    "the plot nicely demonstrates the stability of the topological structure of the spectrum . in particular real eigenvalues and the pseudoscalar matrix elements of their eigenvectors",
    "are seen to be rather stable which underlines their topological nature .",
    "we performed the same analysis ( with less statistics ) for roughened gauge fields starting from the smooth @xmath179 configuration .",
    "again we observed a large region where the topological structure of the spectrum remained stable , with a rather sharp drop of the probability function at the end of the region .",
    "we found that this drop was at a different value of the action per plaquette ( approximately 25 % smaller ) , indicating that , at least for the lattice size we considered , there is no universal threshold in terms of the action where a topological sector gets destroyed .",
    "in the last section we have numerically investigated the form ( [ lasit ] ) of the index theorem on the lattice using test configurations for 4-d su(2 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "the set of gauge field configurations ( [ smoothu ] ) , ( [ roughu ] ) we used is of course rather restricted . on the other hand , testing the obtained picture in a simulation of qcd@xmath180 is certainly too demanding for present computer technology .",
    "however it is possible @xcite to analyze the atiyah - singer index theorem ( [ lasit ] ) in the simpler model of qed@xmath0 .",
    "qed@xmath0 is not only considerably cheaper to simulate , but also has a very simple expression @xcite for its topological charge : @xmath181 \\ ; = \\ ; \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\sum_x \\theta_p(x)$ ] , where @xmath182 with @xmath183 .",
    "configurations where @xmath184 for one of the plaquettes are so - called exceptional configurations @xcite , and no topological charge can be assigned to them .",
    "they are of measure zero in the path integral .",
    "again it is possible to use the atiyah - singer index theorem in the continuum as a guiding line of what to expect on the lattice",
    ". for qed@xmath0 there holds another index theorem , sometimes referred to as _ vanishing theorem _ @xcite .",
    "it states that there are either only left- or only right - handed zero modes .",
    "furthermore , taking into account that in @xmath40 there are 4 species of fermions , 1 in the physical branch and 3 doublers , one expects to find @xmath185 \\big| \\ ; . \\label{nre}\\ ] ] we define @xmath176 to be the probability of finding ( [ nre ] ) correct and evaluate this probability for a whole ensemble of monte carlo configurations generated in a simulation of qed@xmath0 with dynamical fermions @xcite .",
    "we computed @xmath176 for several values of @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "the hopping parameter @xmath29 was always chosen close to the critical value for the given @xmath44 and @xmath187 . in fig .",
    "[ qed2plot ] we plot the probability function @xmath176 as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath188 .",
    "= 2.7 in    it is obvious from this plot that when sending @xmath189 and holding @xmath188 fixed ( which corresponds to sending @xmath189 while holding @xmath190 fixed ) , the probability function @xmath176 approaches 1 .",
    "this implies that ( [ nre ] ) holds with probability 1 in the continuum limit . a detailed analysis @xcite shows , that this result is essentially uniform in @xmath100 and also the chiral properties of the eigenvectors are conform with the expectations from atiyah - singer index theorem and vanishing theorem .",
    "it has to be stressed , that this result is not restricted to some subset of configurations ( as is our analysis for qcd@xmath180 ) since it was established using the complete set of monte - carlo configurations .",
    "this demonstrates that the lattice version of the index theorem holds in fully quantized qed@xmath0 .",
    "we remark , that in @xcite the interplay between the topological charge and the spectrum of the lattice dirac operator was further investigated by demonstrating within the overlap formalism that the chiral condensate in the schwinger model originates from the sectors with topological charge @xmath191 .",
    "the fact that for the wilson - dirac operator hermitian conjugation can be implemented as a similarity transformation with @xmath7 has an important implication for the chiral properties of the eigenvectors of the fermion matrix : only eigenvectors with real eigenvalues have non - vanishing pseudoscalar matrix - elements and thus should be interpreted as the lattice equivalents of the continuum zero - modes .",
    "the lattice version of the atiyah - singer index theorem thus connects the topological charge of the spectrum to the number of real eigenvalues .    in this contribution we analyzed those features of the spectrum of the wilson - dirac operator that are connected to non - trivial topology of the gauge field .",
    "in particular we demonstrated the stability of the real eigenvalues and their corresponding pseudoscalar matrix elements under adding fluctuations to the gauge fields .",
    "this shows the topological nature of the real part of the spectrum . for the computationally less demanding case of u(1 ) gauge fields in two dimensions we analyzed the lattice index theorem for a complete set of configurations from a simulation with dynamical fermions .",
    "it was shown , that the @xmath192 limit is dominated by configurations where the lattice index theorem holds with probability one .",
    "the next logical step in a numerical analysis of the lattice index theorem would be to test the four - dimensional wilson - dirac operator with gauge field configurations from a monte carlo ensemble generated in a quenched or even unquenched simulation .",
    "on the analytic side it would be interesting to investigate the role of the topological part of the spectrum in fermionic correlation functions .",
    "in particular in a spectral decomposition of fermionic @xmath127-point functions one could try to separate the part corresponding to eigenvectors with real eigenvalues . the lattice index theorem ( [ lasit ] )",
    "shows that these contributions are intimately connected to the topological sector of the background gauge field .",
    "interesting insights into u(1 ) problem and witten - veneziano type formulas could be obtained .",
