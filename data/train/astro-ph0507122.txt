    "@xcite identified the brown dwarf 2massw j1207334 - 393254 ( hereafter 2m1207 ) as a likely member of the nearby @xmath18-myr - old tw hydrae association , and reported strong h@xmath0 emission in a low - resolution spectrum , possibly indicative of disk accretion .",
    "@xcite did not find significant l-band ( 3.8@xmath3 m ) excess from it , but @xcite detected mid - infrared excess , a situation analogous to two other stellar members of tw hydrae @xcite .",
    "mohanty , jayawardhana & barrado y navascus ( 2003 ; hereafter mjb03 ) obtained high - resolution spectra of 2m1207 , which showed broad asymmetric h@xmath0 as well as other strong balmer and he i lines , bolstering the case for on - going accretion .",
    "these findings drew widespread attention to 2m1207 as a brown dwarf with a long - lived accretion disk that could serve as a useful benchmark for studies of disk evolution in the sub - stellar regime .",
    "recently , @xcite have found a likely planetary mass companion to 2m1207 ; the pair may have formed as a relatively wide brown dwarf binary .",
    "@xcite noted significant differences in the equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath0 between their own 2001 measurements and those of kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( unpublished ) and mjb03 .",
    "these hints of variations , together with the broad interest in 2m1207 , inspired us to investigate possible accretion variability in this system .",
    "here we report dramatic changes in h@xmath0 emission seen in a series of high - resolution spectra taken between 2005 january - march .",
    "we also present the first high - resolution spectrum of ssspm j1102 - 3431 ( hereafter ssspm1102 ) , another likely sub - stellar member of the tw hydrae association , recently identified by @xcite .",
    "we obtained spectra of 2m1207 in three observing runs with the echelle spectrograph mike at the magellan clay 6.5-m telescope on las campanas . in the first run in january 2005 and the third run in march 2005 , we used no binning and 035 slit , which gives a resolution of @xmath4 .",
    "integration times are between 900 and 1800sec .",
    "the second run , also in march 2005 , was carried out with @xmath5 binning and 10 slit , providing @xmath6 .",
    "the exposure times in this run are @xmath7sec .",
    "our secondary target ssspm1102 was observed on 2005 march 16 with @xmath8sec exposure time .",
    "summary observing log for 2m1207 is given in table [ log ] .",
    "mike is a double echelle spectrograph , consisting of blue and red arms , providing coverage from 3400 to 5000  and 4900 to 9300 , respectively , in our configuration .",
    "all spectra were reduced using standard routines within iraf .",
    "consecutive exposures were co - added to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the spectra of 2m1207 show a variety of emission lines .",
    "the most prominent features are the hydrogen balmer lines , from h@xmath0 down to h10 at 3798 .",
    "hei emission lines are clearly seen at 5876 , 6678 , and 7065 .",
    "in addition , we detect emission in nad ( 5890 + 5895 ) , oi ( 7774 and 8446 ) , several h paschen lines , and in cah+k ( 3968 + 3933 )",
    ". the distinctive emission line spectrum appears in all epochs , but the lines are considerably weaker in the january data compared to the march run . in the march spectra ,",
    "the balmer and hei lines exhibit broad wings and are in most cases clearly asymmetric .",
    "in contrast , in the january data these lines are much narrower and more symmetric .",
    "we note that none of our spectra shows forbidden line emission in [ oi ] or [ sii ] .",
    "the lii 6708  absorption is detected in the co - added 2m1207 spectrum with an ew of @xmath9 , in agreement with the value of 0.5 given by mjb03 .",
    "our second target ssspm1102 exhibits similar emission features to 2m1207 , in particular h balmer and hei , but the lines are narrow and fairly symmetric ( fig .",
    "[ halpha ] , last panel ) . in that sense",
    ", sspm1102 shows a spectrum comparable to 2m1207 during the january run .",
    "lithium is tentatively detected in sspm1102 , with an ew of @xmath10 , consistent with membership in the tw hydrae group .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we focus on the most prominent h balmer features of 2m1207 , particularly h@xmath0 , which shows dramatic changes both in shape and intensity in our dataset . in fig .",
    "[ halpha ] we present the complete time series of h@xmath0 profiles . in the three january spectra ( first three panels ) , the line is relatively weak and only slightly asymmetric .",
    "the march spectra , however , show very intense and in most cases strongly asymmetric h@xmath0 features .",
    "furthermore , the profile exhibits dramatic , quasi - periodic changes , from strongly double - peaked to nearly symmetric with only a weak red shoulder , over the course of a night .",
    "the profile shapes of h@xmath0 in the march spectra can be understood as a superposition of a broad emission peak and a shallower absorption feature .",
    "the absorption component is clearly redshifted , with an offset of 40 - 60@xmath2 ( see table [ log ] ) .",
    "absorption and emission are both variable ; the absorption component disappears and re - appears on timescales of about 1day .    for the h@xmath0 emission line , which is the dominant feature in the red part of the spectrum , we determined the full width at 10% of the peak ( hereafter 10% width , see table [ log ] ) .",
    "in addition , we measured line fluxes for prominent features by integrating the spectrum after subtracting the continuum . in the absence of absolute flux calibrations",
    ", these line fluxes can only be compared to values measured in the same spectrum . in table",
    "[ log ] we list the flux ratio between the h@xmath11 and the h@xmath0 balmer lines .",
    "the results are given in table [ log ] .",
    "the same measurements were also carried out for ssspm1102 .",
    "many of the emission lines seen in the spectrum of 2m1207 are typical indicators for on - going accretion , and are frequently observed in classical t  tauri stars ( ctts ) . perhaps the most intriguing feature is the redshifted absorption component in the h@xmath0 profile , which shows clear changes within a few hours .",
    "redshifted absorption is often seen in the emission lines of ctts , such as aa tau , bp tau @xcite , dn tau @xcite , and tw hya @xcite .",
    "these features are clear signatures of infalling material , and are usually explained in a scenario in which the line of sight points into a funnel flow , and we see the hot spot(s ) against the inflowing gas and not against the photosphere . according to the magnetospheric accretion models of @xcite , red absorption is a strong function of the inclination @xmath12 between the rotational axis and the line of sight , and should only appear if the system has @xmath13 , i.e. when the disk is seen close to edge - on . indeed , it has been shown that t  tauri stars with red absorption have disks at fairly high inclinations , e.g. aa tau ( @xmath14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and bp tau ( @xmath15 , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is likely that 2m1207 is also seen with an inclination @xmath13 , i.e. close to edge - on .    in this scenario",
    ", one would expect the red absorption to vary on timescales similar to the rotation period , as a consequence of hot spots co - rotating with the object .",
    "mjb03 determined a projected rotational velocity ( _ v  sin  i _ ) of 13@xmath16 for 2m1207 , which corresponds to an upper period limit of 25 h , assuming a radius of @xmath17 for 0.03@xmath18 and 10myr @xcite .",
    "if the system is seen at high inclination , the rotation period is in the range of one day .",
    "thus , the red absorption feature in 2m1207 is indeed variable on timescales of the rotation period .",
    "since this is difficult to explain for a system seen close to face - on , this provides further evidence for our given interpretation .",
    "the reported lack of @xmath19 near - infrared colour excess in 2m1207 @xcite may also be consistent with a disk at high inclination , though alternate explanations , such as grain growth or an inner disk hole , are also plausible .    as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ obs ] , 2m1207 shows the complete balmer series down to 3800 . in spectra with a nearly symmetric h@xmath0 profile",
    ", the line fluxes in the higher balmer lines tend to be increased relative to h@xmath0 ( table [ log ] ) .",
    "this tendency provides additional evidence for our given interpretation of the profile changes : if h@xmath0 is double - peaked , the absorption dominates , and we see on average cooler gas than in the symmetric case , where the hot spot is unobscured .",
    "we conclude that the most straightforward explanation for the shape and variations of the h@xmath0 profiles is a high inclination , implying that we see the disk close to edge - on .",
    "this explains both the presence of strong redshifted absorption as well as its variation on timescales of the rotation period . at times",
    "when we see strong redshifted absorption , we may be looking into an accretion column .",
    "the fact that we probably see rotational modulation of this absorption provides evidence for inhomogenuous rather than spherical accretion , as expected in a scenario where the accretion is channeled by the magnetic field .",
    "thus , our findings strongly support magnetospheric accretion in brown dwarfs .",
    "by comparing the spectra from january with those from march , it is obvious that the mass accretion process on 2m1207 is significantly variable .",
    "there is a distinct change in the line profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ halpha ] ) and an increase in the 10% width , which is shown as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ ten ] . in the march spectra ,",
    "the h@xmath0 profile is clearly dominated by accretion , with broad emission and additional redshifted absorption .",
    "the higher levels of the balmer series and hei are also broad and asymmetric , again indicating on - going accretion @xcite .",
    "the 10% widths in march are substantially higher than 200@xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ ten ] ) , which has been proposed as a useful empirical threshold between accreting and non - accreting systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the three january spectra are significantly narrower , and only slightly asymmetric . in one january spectrum ,",
    "weak blue - shifted absorption is visible , usually an indication of outflowing material .",
    "given the lack of forbidden line emission , this is the only evidence for wind in our spectra .",
    "the 10% width in january is only slightly larger than 200@xmath16 , which implies that 2m1207 is only weakly accreting , if at all , at that time .",
    "the 10% width of h@xmath0 can be used to estimate the accretion rate .",
    "@xcite calibrated the correlation between accretion rate and 10% width using objects for which the accretion rate was derived from continuum veiling .",
    "we now use their empirical relation to assess the accretion rate for 2m1207 .",
    "for the three january spectra , we obtain an average value of @xmath20 for the 10% width .",
    "this corresponds to an accretion rate of @xmath21 , where the error estimate takes into account both the scatter of the 10% widths and the uncertainty in transforming to accretion rates .",
    "in contrast , the spectra from march 2005 show a 10% width of @xmath22 .",
    "this converts to an accretion rate of @xmath23 .",
    "although the accretion rates in january and march are comparable within the errors , the 10% widths are higher in march by 32% , which clearly points to a significant change in the accretion rate as well .",
    "it is instructive to compare these results with previous spectroscopic observations of 2m1207 .",
    "@xcite report very strong h@xmath0 emission in two consecutive spectra for 2m1207 taken in 2001 , with ews @xmath24 , corresponding to 10% widths in the range of 300@xmath16 ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2003 ) , i.e. comparable to our march data . on the other hand , mjb03 and kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( unpublished , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have measured h@xmath0 ews of 28 and 42 , likely corresponding to 10% widths around 200@xmath16 , i.e. similar to our january spectra .",
    "thus , the literature data support the strong variations in the h@xmath0 widths ( and hence the accretion rate ) . from the available data we conclude that the accretion rate of 2m1207 changes by a factor of 5 - 10 on a timescale of six weeks .",
    "strong variations in the accretion behaviour have been observed for t  tauri stars in the past .",
    "@xcite find veiling variations in the range of an order of magnitude for several objects , e.g. rw aur , aa tau , dg tau , which implies significant changes in the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the veiling of tw hya is variable between 0.84 and 0.12 on timescales of a few months @xcite , again suggesting variability in the accretion rate .",
    "here we confirm for the first time that brown dwarfs can behave in a very similar manner .",
    "observations with better time sampling and longer baselines are required to obtain more precise constraints on the timescales and the extent of the accretion variability of 2m1207 .",
    "as already mentioned , our second target ssspm1102 shows similar spectral features to 2m1207 , in particular h balmer lines .",
    "10% width is 194@xmath16 , and the profile shows a weak red absorption component ( see fig .",
    "[ halpha ] , last panel ) .",
    "thus , according to the criteria of @xcite , ssspm1102 is only weakly accreting , if at all , at the time of observation .",
    "the h@xmath0 profile shape and 10% width are similar to the january data of 2m1207 , indicating an accretion rate of @xmath25 for ssspm1102 .",
    "we have obtained a time series of 14 high - resolution spectra of the young , accreting brown dwarf 2m1207 , which show a variety of emission lines confirming on - going accretion .",
    "these features are , however , significantly weaker in the january spectra in comparison to the march data .",
    "particularly the h@xmath0 line is strongly variable in shape and width .",
    "the 10% width varies by 32% on a timescale of six weeks , indicating a change in the accretion rate by a factor of 5 - 10 . in the high accretion state , the line profile changes from double - peak to nearly symmetric on timescales of a few hours , with a redshifted absorption feature that disappears and re - appears on timescales of @xmath26d , consistent with the brown dwarf rotation period .",
    "this profile variability can be explained in a scenario where the accretion disk is seen at a relatively low inclination with respect to the line of sight . in cases where we see a double - peaked h@xmath0 line",
    ", we may be looking into an accretion column , co - rotating with the object .",
    "thus , the profile variability provides strong evidence for funneled rather than spherical accretion .",
    "hence , these observations make a compelling case that large - scale magnetic fields play an important role in the accretion process of brown dwarfs .",
