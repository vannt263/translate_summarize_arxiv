    "expectation value of @xmath33 just gives the relation @xmath83 which is obvious .",
    "we define two parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 as @xmath86 as in @xcite , we can define three orthogonal projectors @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 as , @xmath90 in terms of this orthogonal basis , @xmath3 can be expressed as , @xmath91 the old parameters @xmath92 are connected to the new ones @xmath84 , @xmath85 by the relation , @xmath93 in terms of the new parameters the positivity conditions on @xmath3 reads , @xmath94    this is an important class of states of bi - partite systems .",
