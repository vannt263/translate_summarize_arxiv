    "a lack of nonperturbative analytical methods haunts the study of the infrared behaviour of confining field theories such as qcd .",
    "the main tools used for this purpose rely on approximations ( e.g. , semiclassical , large number of colours ) , and rigorous results are attainable in few corners of parameter space .",
    "the bordering region between topology and field physics is especially troubling , since different methods arise sometimes from apparently incompatible hypotheses and physical pictures .",
    "two - dimensional sigma models @xcite are regarded as a convenient testing ground to prepare the assault on four - dimensional gauge theories , because both kinds of theories share a number of important properties : conformal invariance at the classical level , asymptotic freedom , dynamical mass generation , confinement , existence of a topological term @xmath0 and instantons for all values of the _ number of colours _",
    "@xmath3 .",
    "a relevant problem in these theories with topological properties is the @xmath0 dependence of the vacuum energy density , the quantity that determines the phase structure of the theory ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the fate of the discrete parity symmetry @xmath10 upon quantisation at the values @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the only values for which it is classically conserved ) is an issue .",
    "perhaps the simplest model in which the subtlety of the @xmath0-dependence of the vacuum energy @xmath13 is manifest is the quantum rotor @xcite , i.e. , the quantum mechanical problem of the dynamics of a charged particle on the circumference @xmath14 enclosing a magnetic flux @xmath0 . in the absence of perturbations , the vacuum energy is quadratic in @xmath0 ; periodicity of the physics in @xmath15 imposes that the ground level is twofold degenerate for @xmath12 ( i.e. , half a flux quantum across the region bounded by @xmath14 ) and there parity is spontaneously broken .",
    "this , as we will see , mimicks the traditional picture of the large @xmath3 expansion in models .",
    "however , even slight perturbations compatible with reflection symmetry lift the degeneracy of the rotor , by a level repulsion mechanism , making the curve @xmath16 smooth at @xmath12 .",
    "a convenient approximate method is that of the dilute instanton gas , where the vacuum is understood in terms of tunnelling processes among classical vacua . in the dilute approximation ,",
    "the vacuum energy ( a pure nonperturbative effect ) is a smooth periodic function of @xmath0 proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to the semiclassical approximation in models , where instantons play an all - important rle .",
    "structure of the vacuum energy density in the traditional large @xmath3 picture ( above ) and in the semiclassical picture dominated by instantons ( below ) . ]    these two regimes have the following paradigmatic expressions for @xmath16 , illustrated in figure [ analisisn : fig : tworegimes ] : @xmath18",
    "we now consider the situation in models .",
    "exact solutions are known for the quantum model ( equivalent to the @xmath19 model ) both at @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the first case @xcite , the solution exhibits a mass gap , the spectrum consists of an @xmath20 triplet , and parity",
    "is conserved .",
    "this agrees with the haldane map @xcite , which transforms this model into a chain of integer classical spins .",
    "vafa and witten @xcite argued that there is no first order phase transition with spontaneous parity breaking at @xmath11 for qcd , their argument being applicable straightforwardly to all models ( see @xcite for a proof of the vafa - witten theorem using the topological charge as an order parameter ) .",
    "the exact solution of the quantum model at @xmath12 @xcite also conserves parity but shows no mass gap ( this result was anticipated in @xcite ) . the critical behaviour of the model is described by an @xmath20 wznw model at level @xmath21 .",
    "this also agrees with the haldane map , which transforms this model into a chain of half - odd spins . by the lieb - schulz - mattis theorem @xcite",
    ", the absence of mass gap implies that p is conserved . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of a first order phase transition with spontaneous @xmath10 breakdown at @xmath12 has been argued to hold for all models @xcite , by analyzing the nodal structure of the vacuum in the hamiltonian formalism @xcite in analogy with qcd @xcite .    for the intermediate region @xmath22",
    ", analytical techniques are lacking , and we must rely on approximations and numerical simulations .",
    "we will discuss two important approximations , which have been argued to be mutually incompatible : the semiclassical method and the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "the semiclassical approach @xcite is based , as in the case of the rotor , on the picture of the quantum vacuum of 4@xmath23 gauge theories and 2@xmath23 models built from tunnelling processes among classical vacua .",
    "these nonperturbative processes are dominated by instantons and antiinstantons , ( anti)selfdual solutions of the classical euclidean equations of motion .",
    "a dilute gas approximation gives a @xmath0 dependence of the vacuum energy density of the form @xmath24 where @xmath4 is the mass gap .",
    "this dependence can not be seen in perturbation theory due to the nonanalytic dependence of the mass gap on the coupling .",
    "however , a vacuum based on a dilute gas of instantons and antiinstantons is not satisfactory , since the statistical ensemble is dominated by the infrared divergent contribution of arbitrarily large instantons , whose density @xmath25 as a function of size @xmath26 is @xmath27 for the model , with @xmath28 a typical scale of the theory .",
    "a statistical mechanical treatment of _ interacting _ instanton fluids has been developed @xcite , bringing about the instanton liquid picture of the qcd vacuum @xcite .",
    "this may be very relevant for the behaviour of these theories at finite temperature and high density .",
    "we note in passing that the dilute gas approximation breaks down as well in the _ ultraviolet _ for the model , as pointed out by lscher @xcite building on his work with berg @xcite on the geometric definition of a topological charge density on the lattice .",
    "technically , the topological susceptibility in this model does not scale according to the perturbative renormalisation group due to small distance fluctuations .",
    "this is reflected in the singularity of ( [ integralinstantons ] ) as @xmath29 for @xmath30 ; it may also be understood a consequence of the slow vanishing rate of the density of lee - yang zeros as @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "what is remarkable is that , although the semiclassical analysis does not reveal any ultraviolet instanton singularity in the case of model , numerical simulations suggest a similar pathology @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion @xcite stands as an alternative to the semiclassical method .",
    "this technique is based on the simplification of both 4@xmath23 su@xmath32 gauge theories and 2@xmath23 models when @xmath3 is taken to infinity keeping certain parameter combinations constant .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion of models , as developed in @xcite and @xcite , agrees at @xmath11 with the known spectrum , given by a massive particle in the adjoint representation of @xmath33 .",
    "the mass @xmath34 is generated dynamically , and the particle turns out to be a composite state of two fundamental fields , bound together by a coulomb potential . for @xmath35 , this analysis predicts a quadratic @xmath0 dependence @xmath36 of the vacuum energy density around @xmath11 . this dependence can be made to agree with the fundamental requirement that physics be periodic in @xmath0 with period @xmath37 only if there is a first order cusp at odd multiples of @xmath12 , i.e. , a first order phase transition accompanied by spontaneous parity breakdown , as shown in the upper part of figure [ analisisn : fig : tworegimes ] .",
    "instanton effects , being nonperturbative , are not visible in the perturbative expression ( [ intro : ethetacuadratica ] ) . this led witten @xcite to argue that the @xmath1 expansion is not sensitive to instantons  equivalently , that instantons play no significant rle in the quantum models ( or in 4@xmath23 gauge theories ) to the extent that the @xmath1 expansion is a good approximation thereof .",
    "jevicki @xcite , however , argued that instantons resurface in the @xmath1 expansion as _ poles _ of the integrand of the partition function @xmath38 ( eqn .",
    "[ analisisn : funciondeparticionaalfa ] ) , and that @xmath38 can be computed both by the saddle point method and by using a functional cauchy theorem summing the residues of all these poles ( representing resonances ) . then the large @xmath3 limit and instanton effects would not be _ a priori _ incompatible with each other .",
    "the quadratic dependence ( [ intro : ethetacuadratica ] ) agrees with the holographic picture provided by the maldacena conjecture @xcite , and moreover with lattice measurements of the topological susceptibility of models ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the witten - veneziano formula @xcite , derived in this approximation , gives a phenomenologically correct value of the @xmath39 mass in terms of the topological susceptibility at @xmath11 .",
    "however , the appearance of a first order cusp at @xmath12 is in contradiction with the results arising from the nodal analysis of the vacuum @xcite , and with the intuition that level repulsion generically destroys level crossings .    in this work",
    "we show how this discrepancy stems from the fact that the large @xmath3 limit and the thermodynamical limit do not commute .",
    "the traditional formulation of the @xmath1 expansion starts directly at infinite spacetime volume @xmath40 . as we shall see , a procedure in which the thermodynamic limit is taken after the @xmath41 limit provides results compatible both with instanton physics and with the rigorous results at @xmath12 , and different from the reverse order of limits .",
    "a finite volume analysis is in order .",
    "this agrees with schwab s @xcite and mnster s @xcite approach in the case of the sphere ; we moreover outline the application of jevicki s residue method .",
    "we find the case of the torus much more tractable and amenable to explicit computation after integration over the dual torus parametrising the different holomorphic bundle structures within each topological charge sector .",
    "in particular , jevicki s approach requires computation of the residues of meromorphic functions instead of functionals , and his programme can be carried out in the simplest cases exhibiting the reappearance of instantons as resonances ( poles ) in the one - loop effective action .",
    "remarkably , in spite of the absence of regular unit charge instantons on the torus @xcite , the contribution of this sector is nonzero in the resonance approach : this we interpret as the effect of rough configurations near the forbidden regular instanton .    at finite volume",
    "there are two regimes : one dominated by instantons for low mass theories , @xmath42 , and another regime where they are are strongly suppressed , @xmath43 .",
    "the second regime is the relevant one for theories in the thermodynamic limit , but the other regime is relevant for effects where the finite volume or space topology play a leading rle , like in the appearance of edge states in the quantum hall effect .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows . in section [ sec : traditional ] , the traditional large @xmath3 picture of models is reviewed .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of models formulated on the sphere is considered in section [ sec : sphere ] .",
    "the corresponding analysis for the case of the torus is performed in section [ sec : torus ] .",
    "the consequences of this analysis are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the traditional large @xmath3 picture of models was developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we shall now give a brief account of it before the analysis in finite volume .",
    "the large @xmath3 method is based in a saddle point approximation of the partition function , defined on the infinite 2@xmath23 euclidean plane , after integration of the fundamental @xmath44 , @xmath45 fields ( taking values in @xmath46 , i.e. , in representatives of projective classes in ) .",

    "the latter develops an effective kinetic term and couples to the scalars with effective electric charge @xmath60 .",
    "thus there is a confining coulomb interaction between scalars , and the spectrum at @xmath11 consists of @xmath61 bound states , with mass gap @xmath62 , living in the adjoint representation of @xmath33 .    for @xmath35 ,",

    "this term plays the rle of an external electric field in electrodynamics .",
    "therefore , in this picture of the models , its contribution to the vacuum energy density is @xmath66 yielding a topological susceptibility @xmath67 this quadratic dependence is perturbative , i.e. , it can be seen in terms of feynman diagrams .",
    "instanton effects , nonperturbative in nature , were argued in @xcite to be exponentially suppressed in the @xmath1 expansion , and therefore irrelevant for the physics of the models .",
    "however , we have seen that the level crossing and first order phase transition at @xmath12 implied by ( [ analisisn : densenergiacampoelectricofondo ] ) and the requirement of @xmath37-periodicity in @xmath0 are in contradiction with the nodal arguments of @xcite .",
    "we will next go over to a compact space with the purpose of showing that this incompatibility stems from the infinite volume starting point of the traditional @xmath1 analysis .",
    "clarifying the interplay of @xmath3 and the volume , and the effects of taking these to infinity in different orders , requires the models to be first formulated in a compact ( euclidean ) space .",
    "schwab @xcite and mnster @xcite studied the @xmath1 expansion of models on @xmath68 , and observed that the @xmath21 contribution to the partition function is dominated , for large @xmath3 , by a saddle point given by a rotationally invariant instanton ( in the sense that global @xmath69 transformations can be compensated by @xmath19 rotations in euclidean space ) .",

    "however , the problem of computing and summing the residues is too difficult to be tackled analytically , although the previous formulae can be used in a numerical approach ( more progress can be made analytically in the case of the torus , as will be seen in next section ) .",

    "in particular , edge currents are a finite size effect and this suggests that the @xmath42 regime of sigma models is the relevant regime for their description .",
    "finally , we remark that the difference between the two regimes is due to the asymptotic behaviour of the effective action in the different topological sectors . according to equations ( [ n_toro : exponenteyengranyphysical ] ) and ( [ n_toro : exponenteyenpequenyoyphysical ] ) , for small values of the topological charge , @xmath166 ,",
