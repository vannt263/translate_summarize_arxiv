    "large format arrays operating in the near - infrared ( nir ) at a wavelength of 2  @xmath0 m provide an unprecedented opportunity to probe the interior of molecular clouds where the youngest young stellar objects ( class-0 ysos ) are found . in these highly obscured environments",
    "the powerful outflows produced by ysos can be identified by the 2.12  @xmath0 m emission from the @xmath1@xmath2 line of h@xmath3 excited in shocks ( e.g. , bally et al .",

    "imaging at 2.12  @xmath0 m can lead to the discovery of outflows that may otherwise not be found via the identification of optical herbig - haro ( hh ) objects due to high obscuration , or by means of millimeter - wavelength maps of molecular outflows due to poor angular resolution .",
    "omc-2 and omc-3 are two major star forming cloud cores north of omc-1 , located at a distance of about 480  pc , which form a molecular ridge bounded by the orion nebula to the south , and ngc  1977 to the north .",
    "omc-2 and some of its infrared sources were identified by gatley ( 1974 ) and subsequently investigated in the near- and far - infrared ( fir ) by cohen & frogel ( 1977 ) , thronson et al.(1978 ) , thronson & thompson ( 1982 ) , and pendleton et al .",

    "this unusual concentration of embedded proto - stars motivated our nir imaging program .",
    "we observed the omc-2 and omc-3 region with the infrared imager ( irim ) at the kpno 2.1  m on 30 november and 2 december 1996 .",

    "the 1% narrow - band filters are matched in bandpass and wedged to decrease fringing from night sky lines .",
    "we obtained a trio of dithered images in the 2.12  @xmath0 m @xmath1@xmath2 h@xmath3 filter at each pointing .",
    "a trio of dithered sky frames were taken for every two on - source pointings .",
    "these were median combined to create a ` sky ' frame which was subtracted from the on - source images .",

    "52 and possibly knot 51 west of irs  2 ( rayner et al .  1989 ) .",
    "this jet is also visible in the red lines of [ s  ii ] and is designated hh  384 ( r97 ) .",
    "there are a number of knots ( nos .",
    "23 , 37 , 45 ) in the region between irs  2 and fir  1 that are difficult to associate with any particular source or flow due to the high degree of complexity and confusion .",

    "complex filamentary h@xmath3 emission south of omc-2 may in part trace fluorescent h@xmath3 emission excited by uv photons from the h  ii region m43 . however , some of these streamers lie parallel to flow @xmath5 .",
    "some bright knots in this region ( such as knots 62 , 66 and 14 ) resemble compact bow shocks which may trace additional flows .",
    "a linear chain of such knots ( 9 , 10 , 19 , 22 , 26 , and 35 ) forms flow @xmath50 which appears to radiate away from fir  6b and another ( 62 , 60 , 64 , and 66 ) forms flow @xmath51 .      for the best defined outflows , the total 2.12  @xmath0 m @xmath52@xmath2 emission line luminosity is @xmath53 . for a h@xmath3 vibrational excitation temperature of @xmath54",
    "k , the total luminosity for h@xmath3 emission is 10 times that of the @xmath55 line ( e.g. , scoville et al .  1982 ) . assuming a 2.2  @xmath0 m extinction of @xmath56 , the extinction - corrected h@xmath3 luminosity is @xmath57 .",
    "if the flux contribution from fluorescence is minimal , this is a strong lower limit on the rate at which mechanical energy is injected into the molecular cloud since h@xmath3 is but one of many important coolants that radiate away thermal energy in shocks .",
    "the orion nebula has produced on the order of 500 to 1,000 young stars , including a number of high mass ones in the last @xmath58 years .",
    "although much less luminous , the omc-2 and 3 cores and the dense ridge of molecular gas that extends north of the orion nebula appears to be an extremely active site of on - going star formation that contains over a dozen class-0 protostars , dozens of active outflows , and perhaps hundreds of more evolved young stars that have formed within the last few million years .",
    "the large number of active flows and sub - mm sources indicates that this region is continuing to form stars at a high rate .",
    "furthermore , the level of outflow activity indicates that this region is undergoing a ` microburst ' of star formation that is likely to forge a gravitationally unbound cluster richer than ngc  1333 and ic348 in perseus .",
    "the large number of deeply - embedded class-0 sources indicates that this portion of orion is less evolved than either ngc  1977 , the orion nebula , or the ngc  1333 region in the perseus cloud where dozens of herbig - haro flows are visible ( bally , devine , & reipurth 1996 ) .    assuming that the phase during which an outflow is observable only by its h@xmath3 or co emission ( as opposed to shocks visible as herbig - haro objects ) lasts @xmath59 years , comparable to the duration of class-0 ysos , then the formation rate of both h@xmath3 flows and class-0 sources must be about 30 to 40 per @xmath60 years .",
    "this rate of star formation can produce all of the 300 to 400 stars observed in 2  @xmath0 m images of this region ( our images contain about 200 ) in about @xmath58 years .",
    "for every @xmath61 flows , with each flow sweeping out an area @xmath62 scaled to @xmath63  pc@xmath17 , and with velocities @xmath64 scaled to a typical flow speed of @xmath65  km  s@xmath14 , the timescale for reprocessing the local molecular cloud material is @xmath66  yr  pc@xmath67 .",
    "the cumulative effect of jets and outflows from sustained star formation must be an important source of dissociating shocks , and turbulent motions , and must play a crucial role in the dynamics , chemistry , and evolution of star formation within the cloud .",
    "near - ir h@xmath3 emission is a potent tracer of outflow activity , especially in regions where dozens to hundreds of stars are forming per cubic parsec .",
    "co searches for outflows are hampered by large beam sizes and the resulting high degree of source confusion that prevents the recognition of individual , overlapping outflows .",
    "extremely young stars are often so obscured that even mature outflows remain invisible at optical wavelengths .",
    "although orion is one of the most studied sites of star formation , both optical searches for shock excited herbig - haro emission , and bipolar co outflows have utterly failed to reveal the splendor of star formation activity that is now igniting inside the northern portion of the orion  a cloud .",
