    "precise measurements of abundances of extremely metal poor ( emp ) stars have recently been obtained by @xcite ,  .",
    "these provide new constraints for the stellar evolution models ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most striking constraint is the need for primary @xmath7n production in very low metallicity massive stars .",
    "other possible constraints are an upturn of the c / o ratio with a [ c / fe ] about constant or slightly decreasing ( with increasing metallicity ) at very low metallicities , which requires an increase ( with increasing metallicity ) of oxygen yields below [ fe / h]@xmath8 -3 .",
    "about one quarter of emp stars are carbon rich ( c - rich emp , cemp stars ) .",
    "@xcite propose a classification for these stars .",
    "they find two categories : about three quarter are main s - process enriched ( ba - rich ) stars and one quarter are enriched with a weak component of s - process ( ba - normal ) .",
    "the two most metal poor stars known to date , he1327 - 2326 @xcite and he 0107 - 5240 @xcite are both cemp stars .",
    "these stars are believed to have been enriched by only one to several stars and we can therefore compare our yields to their observed abundances without the filter of a galactic chemical evolution model ( gce ) . in an attempt to explain the origin of the abundances observed as well as the metallicity trends , i computed pre - supernova evolution models of rotating single stars with metallicities ranging from solar metallicity down to @xmath1 following the work of @xcite .",
    "the computer model used to calculate the stellar models is described in detail in @xcite . at low metallicities the mixture of the heavy elements we adopted is the one used to compute the opacity tables for weiss 95 s alpha  enriched composition @xcite .",
    "the mass loss rates are described and discussed in @xcite .",
    "very little was known about the mass loss of very low metallicity stars with a strong enrichment in cno elements until recently .",
    "@xcite study the case of wr stars but a crucial case , which has not been studied in detail yet , is the case of red supergiant stars ( rsg ) .",
    "as we shall see later , due to rotational and convective mixing , the surface of the star is strongly enriched in cno elements during the rsg stage .",
    "awaiting for future studies , it is implicitly assumed in this work ( as in @xcite ) that cno elements have a significant contribution to opacities and mass loss rates .",
    "this assumption is supported by the possible formation of molecular lines in the rsg stage .",
    "therefore the mass loss rates depend on metallicity as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass fraction of heavy elements at the surface of the star .",
    "the evolution of the models was in general followed until core si  burning and the stellar yields are calculated as in @xcite .",
    "the main characteristics of the models are presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "more details about the models are presented in @xcite .",
    "the value of 300 kms@xmath3 used for the initial rotation velocity at solar metallicity corresponds to an average velocity of about 220kms@xmath3 on the main sequence ( ms ) which is very close to the average observed value ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "it is unfortunately not possible to measure the rotational velocity of very low metallicity massive stars since they all died a long time ago .",
    "nevertheless , there is indirect evidence that stars with a lower metallicity have a higher rotation velocity .",
    "this can be due to the difficulty of evacuating angular momentum during the star formation , which is even more important at lower metallicities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , a very low metallicity star containing the same angular momentum as a solar metallicity star has a higher surface rotation velocity due to its smaller radius ( one quarter of @xmath11 radius for 20 @xmath0 stars ) . in order to compare the models at different metallicities and with different initial masses , the ratio @xmath12 is used ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath13 is the critical velocity at which matter becomes gravitationally unbound .",
    "@xmath12 increases only as @xmath14 for models with the same angular momentum ( @xmath15 ) but lower metallicity , whereas the surface rotational velocity increases as @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the angular momentum can be compared as well but one has to bear in mind that it varies significantly for models of different initial masses .",
    "finally , @xmath12 is a good indicator for the impact of rotation on mass loss .    in the first series of models , the aim is to scan the parameter space of rotation and metallicity with 20 @xmath0 models since a 20 @xmath0 star is not far from the average massive star concerning stellar yields . for this series",
    ", two initial rotational velocities were used at very low metallicities .",
    "the first one is the same as at solar metallicity , 300kms@xmath3 .",
    "the second @xmath18 is 500 at z=10@xmath19 ( [ fe / h]@xmath20 - 3.6 ) and 600kms@xmath3 at z=10@xmath21 ( [ fe / h]@xmath8 - 6.6 ) .",
    "these second values have ratios of the initial velocity to the break  up velocity , @xmath22 , around 0.55 , which is only slightly larger than the solar metallicity value ( 0.44 ) .",
    "the 20 @xmath0 model at z=10@xmath21 and with 600kms@xmath3 has a total initial angular momentum @xmath23ergs which is the same as the solar metallicity 20 @xmath0 model with 300kms@xmath3 ( @xmath24ergs ) .",
    "so a velocity of 600kms@xmath3 , which at first sight seems extremely fast , is probably the average velocity at z=10@xmath21 . in the second series of models ,",
    "i follow the exploratory work of @xcite and compute models at z=10@xmath21 with initial masses of 40 , 60 and 85 @xmath0 and initial rotational velocities of 700 , 800 and 800kms@xmath3 respectively .",
    "note that , for these models as well , the initial total angular momentum is similar to the one contained in solar metallicity models with rotational velocities of 300kms@xmath3 .",
    "since this is the case , velocities between 600 and 800kms@xmath3 are considered in this work as the average rotational velocities at these very low metallicities .",
    ".initial parameters of the models ( columns 15 ) : mass , metallicity , rotation velocity [ kms@xmath3 ] , total angular momentum [ 10@xmath26ergs ] and @xmath12 .",
    "total lifetime [ myr ] and various masses [ @xmath0 ] ( 710 ) : final mass , masses of the helium and carbon  oxygen cores and the remnant mass .",
    "total stellar yields ( wind + sn ) [ @xmath0 ] for carbon ( 11 ) , nitrogen ( 12 ) and oxygen ( 13 ) . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     contrarily to what was initially expected from very low metallicity stars , mass loss can occur in massive stars @xcite .",
    "the mass loss occurs in two phases .",
    "the first phase is when the star reaches break  up velocities towards the end of the main sequence .",
    "due to this effect stars , even metal free ones , are expected to lose about 10% of their initial masses for an average initial rotation .",
    "the second phase in which large mass loss can occur is during the rsg stage .",
    "indeed , stars more massive than about 60 @xmath0 at @xmath1 become rsg and dredge  up cno elements to the surface .",
    "this brings the total metallicity of the surface to values within an order of magnitude of solar and triggers large mass loss .",
    "the final masses of the models are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the case of the 85 @xmath0 model is extremely interesting ( see fig .",
    "[ m85 ] _ left _ ) since it loses more than three quarter of its initial mass .",
    "it even becomes a wo star .      in fig .",
    "[ m85 ] ( _ right _ ) , we compare the chemical composition of the wind material with abundances observed in non - evolved carbon rich extremely and ultra @xcite metal poor stars .",
    "the ejected masses of the wind material are also given in table [ wind ] .",
    "it is very interesting to see that the wind material can reproduce the observed abundance in two ways . either , the wind material is richer than necessary and dilution ( by a factor 100 for example for the 40 @xmath0 models and he1327 - 2326 ) with the ism is needed or the wind has the right enrichment ( for example the 60 @xmath0 and he1327 - 2326 ) and the low mass star could form from pure wind material .",
    "the advantage of the pure wind material is that it has a ratio @xmath28c/@xmath29c around 5 @xcite and it can explain li depletion . with or without dilution ,",
    "the wind material has the advantage that it brings the initial metallicity of the low mass star above the critical value for its formation @xcite ."
