    "in the lhc era of precision qcd , which entails predictions for qcd processes at the total precision  @xcite tag   of @xmath0 or better , we need resummed @xmath1 corrections , in the presence of parton showers , on an event - by - event basis , without double counting and with exact phase space .",

    "@xcite , no precision prediction for a hard lhc process at the 1% level can be complete without taking the large ew corrections into account .",

    "we compare with recent data from fnal to make direct contact with observation .",
    "section  [ concl ] contains our summary remarks .    for reference purposes , we call attention to the analyses in refs .  @xcite , wherein the authors have argued that the current state - of - the - art theoretical precision tag on single z production at the lhc is @xmath4 and that the analogous estimate for single w production is @xmath5% . one can not emphasize too much that these estimates show how much work is still needed to achieve the desired 1.0% total precision tag on the two respective processes , for example .",

    "@xcite for the corresponding details .",
    "these results have been implemented by mc methods as we exhibit in what follows .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the stage is set for the full mc implementation of our approach .",
    "we turn next to the initial stage of this implementation  that of the kernels in ( [ dglap19 ] ) .",
    "in this section we describe the implementation of the new ir - improved kernels in the herwig6.5 environment , which results in a new mc , which we denote by herwiri1.0 , which stands for `` high energy radiation with ir improvement '' .",
    "specifically , our approach can be summarized as follows .",
    "we modify the kernels in the herwig6.5 module hwbran and in the attendant related modules  @xcite with the following substitutions:@xmath20 while leaving the hard processes alone for the moment .",
    "we have in progress  @xcitethe inclusion of yfs synthesized electroweak modules from refs .",

    "let us illustrate the implementation by an example  @xcite , which for pedagogical reasons we will take as a simple leading log shower component with a virtuality evolution variable , with the understanding that in herwig6.5 the shower development is angle ordered  @xcite so that the evolution variable is actually @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the opening angle of the shower as defined in ref .",

    "@xcite , the probability that no branching occurs above virtuality cutoff @xmath24 is @xmath25 so that [ eq : splitprob ] d_a(t , q_0 ^ 2 ) = ( t , q_o^2)_bdzp_ba(z ) , which implies _",
    "^ 2)=. [ delta - a ] the attendant non - branching probability appearing in the evolution equation is the respective virtuality of parton @xmath26 is then generated with _",

    "s(q ) = , we get for example _ 0 ^ 1 dz p_qg(z ) & = & + & = & . so that the subsequent integration over @xmath29 yields & & i=_q_0 ^ 2^q^2 + & = & |_q_0 ^ 2^q^2 + & = & .    finally , introducing @xmath30 into ( [ delta - a ] ) yields [ deltaqherwig ] _ a(q^2,q_0 ^ 2 ) & = & + & = & ^- . if we now let @xmath31 , then ^ = r which implies t = ^2 ( ) ^r^.

    "where in the last line we used the notation in herwig6.5 .",

    "*    the leading log exercise leads to the same algebraic relationship that herwig6.5 has between @xmath34 and @xmath35 but we stress that in herwig6.5 these quantities are the angle - ordered counterparts of the virtualities we used in our example , so that the shower is angle - ordered .",
    "when we repeat the above calculation for the ir - improved kernels in ( [ dglap19 ] ) , we have p_qg^exp(z ) = f_yfs(_g)e^_g so that _ 0 ^ 1 dz p_qg(z)^exp & = + & .",

    "[ iri - vs - cs ] we show the difference between the two results for @xmath37 .",
    "we see that they agree within a few % except for the softer values of @xmath38 , as expected .",
    "we look forward to determining definitively whether the experimental data prefer one over the other .",
    "this detailed study will appear elsewhere  @xcite but we begin the discussion below with a view on recent fnal data .",
    "again , we note that the comparison in fig .",
    "[ iri - vs - cs ] is done here at the leading log virtuality level , but the sub - leading effects we have suppressed in discussing it will not change our general conclusions drawn therefrom .    we have carried out the corresponding changes for all of the kernels in ( [ dglap19 ] ) in the herwig6.5 environment , with its angle - ordered showers , resulting in the new mc , herwiri1.0 , in which the isr parton showers have ir - improvement as given by the kernels in ( [ substitn ] ) . in the original release of the program , v. 1.0 , we stated that the time - like parton showers had been completely ir - improved in a way that suggested the space - like parton showers had not yet been ir - improved at all .",
    "then , in release 1.02 , we stated that the only part of the space - like parton showers without ir - improvement in v. 1.0 is that associated with herwig6.5 s space - like module hwsgqq for the space - like branching process @xmath39 , a process which is not ir divergent and which is , in any case , a sub - dominant part of the shower .",
    "the module hwsqgg was ir - improved as well in the release herwiri1.02 .",
    "this was in fact an oversight , as the module hwsfbr which controls the remainder of the space - like branching processes was also still in need of ir - improvement in versions 1.0 and 1.02 .",
    "we have done the required ir - improvement of the latter module as well in version 1.031 . while the effect in going from version 1.0 to version 1.02 is small , that in going from version 1.02 to 1.031 is not in general and we recommend version 1.031 for the best precision .",
    "we now illustrate some of the results we have obtained in comparing isr showers in herwig6.5 and with those in herwiri1.0(31 ) at lhc and at fnal energies , where some comparison with real data is also featured at the fnal energy .",
    "specifically , we compare the z - distributions , @xmath18-distributions , etc . ,",
    "that result from the ir - improved and usual dglap - cs showers in what follows .",
    "first , for the generic 2@xmath32 hard processes at lhc energies ( 14 tev ) we get the comparison shown figs .",
    "[ fighw1 ] , [ fighw2 ] for the respective isr @xmath40-distribution and @xmath41 distribution at the parton level . here",
    ", there are no cuts placed on the mc data and we define @xmath40 as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the cms beam energy and @xmath44 is the respective parton energy in the cms system .",
    "the two quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 for partons are of course not directly observable but their distributions show the softening of the ir divergence as we expect .",
    "-distribution ( isr parton ) shower comparison in herwig6.5.,height=283 ]    turning next to the similar quantities for the @xmath45 production in the generic @xmath46 hard processes at lhc , we see in figs .",
    "[ fighw3 ] , [ fighw4 ] that spectra in the former are similar and spectra in the latter are again softer in the ir - improved case .",
    "these spectra of course would be subject to some `` tuning '' in a real experiment and we await with anticipation the outcome of such an effort in comparison to lhc data",
    ".     energy fraction distribution shower comparison in herwig6.5.,height=264 ]     @xmath47-distribution shower comparison in herwig6.5.,height=264 ]    we turn next to the luminosity process of single @xmath48 production at the lhc , where in figs .",
    "[ fighw5],[fighw6],[fighw7 ] we show respectively the isr parton energy fraction distribution , the z - p@xmath49 distribution , and the z - rapidity distribution with cuts on the acceptance as @xmath50 for @xmath51  all lepton rapidities are included . for the energy fraction distribution and the p@xmath49 distributions",
    "we again see softer spectra in the former and we see similar spectra in the latter in the ir - improved case . for the rapidity plot , we see the migration of some events to the higher values of @xmath52 , which is not inconsistent with a softer spectrum for the ir - improved case .",
    "rapidity here as the soft gluons which we study only have an indirect affect on it via momentum conservation ? but , this means that the rapidity predicted by the ir - improved showers should be close to that predicted by the un - improved showers and we show this cross - check is indeed fulfilled in our plots . ]",
    "we look forward to the confrontation with experiment , where again we stress that in a real experiment , a certain amount of `` tuning '' with affect these results",
    ". the question will always be which set of distributions gives a better @xmath53 per degree of freedom .",

    ", there is are ir - cut - off parameters used to separate real and virtual effects and necessitated by the + -function representation of the usual dglap - cs kernels .",
    "in herwiri , these parameters can be taken arbitrarily close to zero , as the ir - improved kernels are integrable  @xcite .",
    "we now illustrate the difference in ir - cut - off response by comparing it for herwig6.5 and herwiri : we change the default values of the parameters in herwig6.5 by factors of .7 and 1.44 as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fighw8 ] .",
    "we see that the harder cut - off reduces the phase space only significantly for the ir - improved kernels and that the softer cut - off has also a small effect on the usual kernels spectra whereas as expected the ir - improved kernels spectra move significantly toward softer values as a convergent integral would lead one to expect .",
    "this should lead to a better description of the soft radiation data at lhc .",

    "<S> we have implemented the new ir - improved dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi - callan - symanzik ( dglap - cs ) kernels recently developed by one of us in the herwig6.5 environment to generate a new mc , herwiri1.0(31 ) , for hadron - hadron scattering at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we present mc data that illustrate the comparison between the parton shower generated by the standard dglap - cs kernels and that generated by the new ir - improved dglap - cs kernels . </S>",
    "<S> we also show comparisons with fnal data and we discuss possible implications for lhc phenomenology . </S>"
