    "most academic study and analysis about free will takes place in philosophy departments rather than science departments .",
    "however , the relation between free will and scientific theories is a major unresolved issue .",
    "links with quantum theory and chaos theory are alluded to by some philosophers .",
    "here it is argued that the subject of free will is accessible to science , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "scientific investigation has the potential to illuminate and clarify the philosophical debate .",
    "the outcome of research in this area will be of major significance leading to either new physics or a radical change to the cultural view of free will .",
    "free will appears in the literature in two ways , as an abstract concept and also as an actual phenomenon .",
    "the definitions are more often implied than stated in philosophical writings and the different use of the term free will reflects differing philosophical views .",
    "both lead to questions that a scientist and experimentalist can explore .",
    "traditionally free will has been described as when    1 .",
    "it is  up to us  what we choose from a number of alternative possibilities . + and 2",
    "the origin of our choices is within us and not in anything over which we have no control .",
    "( kane,2002 p5 ) .",
    "there are arguments ( frankfurt , 1969 ) to show that free will is about decisions rather than the consequential actions .",
    "the decision to lift your arm involves some aspect of free will , but the subsequent nerve signals and muscle contractions can be described by traditional deterministic physical models .",
    "this paper is concerned with the decision making process .",
    "the literature contains two very different concepts of free will .",
    "an agent has free will if it makes decisions [ in response to external stimuli ] that are neither random nor determined from outside the agent .",
    "the choices are not consequences of physical laws .",
    "this is a libertarian definition .",
    "it is based on the dualist concept , of mind and body being distinct , with only the body being governed by the known physical laws .",
    "an agent has free will if the decision making appears to satisfy the abstract definition of free will .",
    "distinguishing the two different concepts is vital to a scientific investigation .",
    "the two forms of free will raise very different questions and suggest different analytical approaches . modeling free will requires that the abstract definition is false . while the question _ do we have free will ? _ is trivially true from the phenomenological definition .",
    "the two concepts are both amenable to science ; they suggest questions and investigations that are common to most unexplained phenomena and new theoretical ideas .",
    "this is hardly surprising ; the abstract definition is a theoretical proposition , while the phenomena are observable but as yet unexplained .",
    "scientists know how to explore such matters .",
    "scientific models can illuminate some of the philosophical debates - perhaps decisively .",
    "the abstract concept is a theoretical idea .",
    "it raises the questions :    * is their any evidence that it exists ?",
    "* how would we look for it ?",
    "a similar question in current physics research would be the concept of dark matter as a new form of matter in the universe .",
    "we would ask the same questions .    the phenomenon of free will does exist .",
    "it is what we perceive as a fundamental property of our decision making and of other humans too . as scientists we can ask :    *",
    "can we model it ? *",
    "do we need to introduce indeterminism ?",
    "the two approaches are inter - related , for if we can model the phenomenon of free will accurately , then there can not be compelling evidence for free will in the abstract sense .",
    "of course we can not disprove a non - physical explanation we can just render it unnecessary .",
    "similarly , newton s laws of gravitation could not disprove that angels were responsible for planetary motion .",
    "returning to the example of dark matter , a related phenomena would be the anomalous rotation of galaxies .",
    "we could model the rotation of stars in galaxies , if we could develop an accurate model based on known matter and physical laws then the supposition of dark matter would be unnecessary , if we failed repeatedly then the concept of dark matter would gain credence and importance .",
    "the abstract form of free will requires some processes that are not described by the laws of physics as we know them . if it is true - that there is evidence of free will in the abstract sense",
    "- then we have an opening to new and previously unexplored science .",
    "we are like the pioneers doing the first experiments with steam power or electricity .",
    "how ironic that we can spend billions on the next generation of collider in the hope of revealing new physics when perhaps we could simply study our own students to reveal even more novel physics .",
    "the idea that within ourselves are elements that are beyond the laws of physics is quite extraordinary to a scientist . in a reductionist sense",
    "we are composed of molecules satisfying known fundamental laws .",
    "while much of physics is now studying emergent phenomena rather than fundamental interactions , the abstract concept of free will denies that free will is an emergent large scale property inevitably following from established physical laws .",
    "much as the existence of the abstract idea of free will has startling ramifications for physics , the contrary hypothesis , that our decision making is governed by known physical laws would seem to be be contrary to cultural perceptions .",
    "even a model using combinations of deterministic physical laws and quantum indeterminacy would be a major departure from our intuitive understanding of free will .",
    "philosophers debate both the form of free will as well as the consequences of different beliefs .",
    "this paper says nothing about the social and religious implications .",
    "the philosophical views of free will can be roughly categorized as :    * * libertarians * who believe in the abstract notion of free will * * compatibilists * who believe in a phenomenological form of free will that is governed by the known physical laws .",
    "while it does not satisfy the abstract definition of free will they believe that we have all the free will that matters .",
    "* * hard determinists * who believe we have decision making processes governed by physical laws . and",
    "that the decision making processes do not satisfy the requirements of being called free will .",
    "philosophers will debate the social and religious implications of the alternative views . that is beyond the scope of a scientific investigation .",
    "but we can provide substantial evidence to distinguish between the views .",
    "one avenue of philosophical debate is how to interpret _ could have done otherwise _ when any attempt to repeat the decision would have different initial conditions .",
    "this scenario is familiar to experimental scientists .",
    "good experimental design is vital to limit variation .",
    "residual uncertainty is dealt with through statistical analysis and designing experiments that look for correlations rather than absolute single events .",
    "free will seems as amenable to experimental test as uncontentious hypotheses about animal behaviour or medicine .",
    "before describing a model , it is helpful to eliminate other aspects of our decision making and behaviour . this will simplify the construction of a model of free will .    1 .",
    "free will is universal our own experiences of free will are the same as other humans .",
    "it is a common assumption in science that what we learn on one system is applicable to similar systems .",
    "this allows us to make inferences from our own experiences of our own decision making processes and extrapolate to other humans .",
    "it is not restricted to important or moral questions human decision making exhibits _",
    "free will _ when making a trivial decision such as shall i lift my arm ?",
    "just as much as when deciding whether or not to commit a crime .",
    "thus we draw a distinction between the models of free will and the moral implications that follow .",
    "it is independent of intelligence decisions can be stupid and irrational .",
    "they can be made by a genius or an idiot . the apparent ability to choose freely is largely independent of intelligence .",
    "intelligence and free will are different properties , but not totally unrelated in an experimental sense , because an agent who is so simplistic that it has no comprehension of the stimuli presented nor any understanding of the consequences of actions would not be testable .",
    "it is not predictable any algorithm that attempts to reproduce the phenomenon of free will has to be unpredictable to an observer .",
    "although certain decisions may be predicted with a high probability , most are uncertain .",
    "it is not random there are significant correlations between stimuli and responses .",
    "although any one decision is unpredictable , probabilities may be predicted and correlations and trends do exist .",
    "it is distinct from creativity .",
    "free will is exercised in mundane situations where neither choice is creative .",
    "it is distinct from an ability to communicate .",
    "decisions exhibit free will even if they are unobserved , if the observer speaks a different language or if the agent is unable to communicate for other reasons .",
    "the design of a model was stimulated by a consideration of how it would be tested .",
    "how would we test a computer to see if it had free will ? to distance ourselves from preconceptions about computers ; imagine a scenario where an alien spacecraft lands and an agent wearing a suit comes out and appears to do some investigations on the soil and fauna . how would we tell if the agent was a sophisticated automaton following a programme , or an agent with free will ?",
    "we infer that another human has free will by extrapolation from our own experiences , but this approach would not suffice for the alien .    to generalize , could we design an agent that could pass a turing type test ? - where it was not possible for the tester to tell if decisions were made by a human with free will or a programmed agent .",
    "the notion that our decision making is algorithmic and possibly deterministic is contrary to most personal beliefs .",
    "we are certainly unaware of following an algorithm , but there are common examples of people unknowingly following rules",
    ". a parent will know ways to influence their children s behaviour with predictable consequences that the child is unaware of . on stage derren brown s shows rely on both controlling and predicting decision - making without the subject being aware of the processes being followed -",
    "the effect is uncanny .",
    "it demonstrates clearly that decisions we might attribute to free will are actually following algorithms to some extent - but could they be entirely the consequences of an algorithm ?    as scientists trying to model and test free will , we were challenged during a seminar to test a random number generator to see if it had free will .",
    "simple passive observations would not suffice , since a free agent could choose to mimic randomness .",
    "if the agent could not recognize external stimuli nor understand the consequences of a decision then a _ turing test _ could not be applied . a random response to stimuli",
    "is not a characteristic of free will . from an experimental view , a useful model would need to go beyond passive observation of choices .",
    "it is clear from these examples that while free will may be independent of communication , any experimental test would need some level of communication , possibly one way .",
    "the agent would need some level of intelligence to communicate and understand the non - trivial concepts .",
    "an explanation of decision making by the agent might also help with the evaluation , but may not be necessary .",
    "the model is based on a very simple decision - having a drink or not having a drink .",
    "the agent has a higher probability of having a drink if its _ thirst _ is greater .",
    "the level of thirst adjusts a threshold level .",
    "the decision is made by comparing the output of a pseudo random number generator with the varying threshold .",
    "thirst increases with time if the agent does not drink .",
    "implicit in the model is a link between drinking and reducing thirst .",
    "clearly the model can be expanded to include other stimuli ( e.g. being offered food ) and other internal factors ( e.g. laziness ) . extra stimuli and better analysis and evaluation of alternative decisions all serve to add complexity and  intelligence  to the system , but the complexity does not make free will .",
    "the detailed behaviour depends upon the weightings given to the parameters .",
    "the model is deliberately simple .",
    "it is not intended to model intelligence nor all aspects of human behaviour and experience .",
    "the aim is to focus on the free will aspect of simple decisions without extraneous complications .",
    "epsf    ( 150,80 )    ( 10,0 )    the model is unpredictable because of the pseudo random number generator , but the behaviour is not random because there is a correlation between the degree of thirst and the probability of having a drink .",
    "implicit in the model is that the agent has a link between drinking and thirst .",
    "two unique features of the model are :    * * independence * to model human free will needs some implementation of _ could have chosen otherwise _ that is apparent and testable . to achieve this we introduce an internal factor that we call _ independence_. independence is satisfied when the agent resists an attempt to predict behaviour .",
    "* * challenge * we also need a recognizable stimulus , which we call a _ challenge _ this is an external attempt to predict behaviour . in the complex real world",
    "recognizing a challenge requires communication and some degree of intelligence , but this model is explicitly programmed to recognize a challenge .",
    "it has been argued that the ability to do otherwise is constrained by character ( dennet , 1984 ) , and that complete freedom to do otherwise is not necessary for free will . in our model , the algorithm itself encapsulates the rudimentary equivalent of character as an increase in the weighting for laziness .",
    "a computer model was developed and tested with a small number of subjects in a turing style test .",
    "the model contained :    1 .",
    "stimuli 1 .   a cup of water 2 .",
    "challenges : 1 .",
    "you will drink the water 2 .",
    "you will not drink 2 .",
    "the internal factors 1 .",
    "laziness 2 .",
    "thirst 3 .",
    "independence 3 .",
    "response 1 .",
    "take the water 2 .",
    "do not take the water 4 .",
    "explanations to aid the test    the last item was not an essential element of free will but was required to aid the test .",
    "the agent was given a set of _ explanations _ to describe the decision .",
    "in a blind test , a series of stimuli were presented by the inquisitor to a person and computer behind a screen . in half the tests",
    ", the person was instructed to decide for themselves from a preset list of actions and also to choose an explanation from a preset list . in the other half of cases the person followed instructions from the computer and passed on explanations as directed by the computer .",
    "after ten interactions the inquisitor guessed if the responses were selected by the computer or the person . ,    a calibration run was made to adjust the internal parameters to select appropriate weights to the stimuli and internal factors .",
    "a subsequent experiment was run with different people .",
    "the total results were that out of 19 tests the computer or person were correctly identified on 7 occasions . in this simple test",
    "the computer agent and the person were indistinguishable .",
    "the algorithm also suggests a statistical measure of free will .",
    "the agent has a correlation between stimuli and a logical response .",
    "the correlation coefficient is influenced by the _ challenge to do otherwise_. it is postulated that this is a distinctive feature of the phenomena known as free will .",
    "the experiment is limited in scope , but it sets a challenge - how would you test an agent to see if it had free will ?",
    "we have proposed a tentative answer .",
    "we would attempt to predict behaviour and challenge the agent to take an alternative , less favourable , action to defy our prediction .",
    "this test was applied to our simple model and it is indistinguishable from a human agent .",
    "the same method could be applied to any agent provided we could issue a challenge .",
    "the decision making can be observed passively or aided by communication ( explanations ) from the agent .",
    "the test is therefore limited to agents that could recognize a challenge - a feat that requires a limited amount of intelligence and at least one - way communication .",
    "the testing method could be applied to the alien visitor described above .    with a minimal set of stimuli and actions",
    "we have successfully modelled the phenomenon of free will with a deterministic algorithm , there is no need to invoke quantum uncertainty nor chaotic indeterminism to model the indeterminism of free will",
    ". a random number generator based on an intrinsically quantum mechanical process could be introduced , but as dennet ( 1984 , p120,p151 ) says it would serve no more purpose than the pseudo - random number generator .",
    "the essential feature of the model is that it recognizes a challenge ( that attempts to predict choices ) and tends to contradict the challenge .",
    "the model is very simple",
    ". it would be easy to add links between , external stimuli and the internal factors - and even changing parameters in the evaluation algorithm .",
    "a part of the agent could also act to generate challenges to itself ( this seems an intrinsic part of our experience of free will ) a history of stimuli , decisions and outcomes could form the basis of a system that also learnt ( and hence could be taught ) . with added complexity , and retaining the propensity to resist a challenge",
    ", there is no obvious reason why the system can not model free will for all practical purposes and therefore support a soft determinist point of view .    it could be argued that an attempt to model free will presupposes a soft deterministic view .",
    "this is not the case because a successful outcome is not assumed and was not inevitable .",
    "consider for example an attempt to model precognition !",
    "there are very good reasons to believe that any attempt to model precognition with a classical deterministic computer would fail !",
    "it is the modest success of the model that supports soft - determinism , not the attempt to build a model .",
    "the cultural and moral implications may not be as significant as the opposing views of free will might suggest .",
    "smilansky ( 2000 ) argues that the illusion of free will is sufficient for society .",
    "a good model would have to preserve the illusion of free will in order to be accurate .",
    "this is achieved because when the agent acts as if it had free will ( in the abstract sense ) it is unable to describe the internal decision making algorithm that it uses .",
    "the intention of this work was to open a new area to theoretical and experimental physics .",
    "in doing so , the model and results contribute to the philosophical debate .",
    "there may also be consequences for the social sciences because the concepts introduced here allow a wider range of human behaviour to be modelled ."
