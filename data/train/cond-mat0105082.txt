    "the lorentz gas  @xcite is one of the fundamental kinetic theory models  @xcite , and many of its ergodic properties are well known  @xcite . in a previous paper  @xcite we investigated the scattering and transmission properties of an array of disks centered on a finite triangular lattice , a lorentz slab .",
    "there , we studied the validity of approximating the motion of such a particle by a diffusive process  @xcite . specifically , we considered samples of finite thickness @xmath0 along the @xmath1 axis , but infinite along the @xmath2 axis .",
    "we then looked at the behavior of a particle incident on the sample from the left and measured the probability @xmath3 of being transmitted to the right , the reflection probability @xmath4 and the average residence time @xmath5 .",
    "we found a very satisfactory agreement with the predictions of one dimensional brownian motion for all these quantities when the distance between scatterers is small enough to prevent any particle from moving in an arbitrarily long straight line ( the so - called finite horizon case ) .",
    "when such unbounded motion is possible we found that normal diffusive behavior did not arise .",
    "rather , a complex pattern of logarithmic corrections was found for the various quantities of interest .",
    "a modification of the diffusive model considering lvy walks as suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite explains such features .",
    "here we study the situation in which the system is randomly diluted , but the scatterers are still placed on the the sites of a triangular lattice .",
    "that is , we consider the case in which a fraction @xmath6 of the cells of the periodic array is occupied by scatterers and the rest is empty . in such a system , the particle can always take steps of arbitrary length , but the horizon is said to be finite if the distribution of free paths has an exponential cutoff .",
    "this happens when the corresponding system with @xmath7 has finite horizon,_i.e .",
    "_ , the only large steps that occur in the diluted system are related to the absence of a large number of scatterers , which is an exponentially improbable event . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to this finite horizon case .",
    "the importance of looking at the randomly diluted case , is that it provides a controlled way of varying the mean free path  and hence the diffusion constant  over an arbitrarily large range , without affecting the property of having a finite horizon and hence a normal diffusive behavior .",
    "this therefore allows us to check the correspondence with diffusion models much more thoroughly .",
    "further , it shows that the correspondence between classical deterministic motion and brownian motion , as proved rigorously in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of periodic billiards , does not , in fact , require strict periodicity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ models ] we describe in detail how the numerical experiments are performed . in particular ,",
    "we define two different ways in which we introduce disorder in the system , namely _ quenched _ and _ annealed_. in section  [ transport ] , we discuss the average transport properties , such as transmission probability , mean free path and average scattering time .",
    "we find that the last two quantities can be evaluated exactly using a relationship due to kac  @xcite .",
    "we display the numerical results for these quantities as well as the predictions using the kac formula and the diffusion model . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we reproduce the derivation of the kac formula in appendix a. in sec .",
    "[ distribution ] we discuss the distribution functions of free paths , of residence times and of heights of exit of transmitted particles . in appendix",
    "b we derive the latter two distributions for the diffusion model . finally in sec .  [ conclusions ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the geometric arrangement of the scatterers in the undiluted ( @xmath7 ) system is the following : each scatterer is a disk of unit radius , the centers of which form a triangular lattice .",
    "the slab is infinite in the vertical direction and is characterized by the number @xmath0 of columns and the minimal separation @xmath8 between the disks .",
    "dilution is then obtained by occupying only a fraction @xmath6 of the sites of the array with disks of unit radius .",
    "a typical scatterer configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fslab ] . the left and right `` sawtooth '' borders",
    "are the outer sides of the hexagonal cells attached to each site of the lattice .",
    "particles are launched from randomly chosen positions along the left border .",
    "each incident particle has a different impact parameter @xmath9 , defined here as the distance between the initial position and the horizontal line passing through the center of the scatterer in the cell .",
    "the angles of incidence @xmath10 measured with respect to the side from which the particle is launched , are distributed in the interval @xmath11 $ ] in such a way as to make @xmath12 uniformly distributed .",
    "this choice reproduces initially the liouville measure in the birkhoff coordinates .",
    "the particles move freely except for elastic collisions at the boundary of the disks .    in the undiluted case ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "if the separation between scatterers @xmath8 is small , @xmath13 , the length of free motion of the particles is bounded and they `` see '' a finite horizon .",
    "all the numerical experiments discussed in this paper are performed in this range . on the other hand , in the diluted case ,",
    "arbitrarily long paths without collisions can exist also for @xmath14 , but their contribution to the diffusion constant remains finite .",
    "as far as the dilution process itself is concerned , we realize it in two different ways corresponding to the usual distinction between _ quenched _ and _ annealed _ disorder .",
    "the annealed disorder is obtained by choosing with probability @xmath6 the cell to be occupied at the moment at which the particle enters the cell .",
    "thus , when the particle eventually revisits a given cell , its occupancy status may be different .",
    "this way of introducing disorder involves a simultaneous average over the dynamical and the disorder variables . on the other hand",
    ", we also performed dilution in the more realistic quenched case , in which a sample is first created , for which all cells are either occupied or empty with probability @xmath6 and averages are taken over many realizations of disorder .",
    "we begin this section by showing a derivation of a formula for the mean free path @xmath15 as a function of the geometrical parameter @xmath8 and dilution @xmath6 .",
    "this quantity can be evaluated in terms of phase space integrals using kac formula  @xcite , which assumes ergodicity .",
    "indeed , as shown in appendix a , for a particle moving freely at unit velocity in a bounded domain of area @xmath16 , the average return time @xmath17 to a boundary segment of length @xmath18 is @xmath19 for the lorentz gas , choosing the boundary segment as the perimeter of all disks , the average return time coincides with the mean free time between two collisions . since the particles move with unit velocity , this also coincides with the mean free path @xmath15 .",
    "considering a finite array of wigner - seitz hexagonal cells with @xmath0 columns and @xmath20 rows , the total area of the domain is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the cell area . from this",
    "we must subtract the area occupied by the unit radius disks , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 .",
    "the total perimeter is @xmath24 .",
    "hence , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : time ] ) and the above considerations @xmath25 note that this holds for any value of @xmath20 and hence extends trivially to the case we consider , where @xmath20 is infinite .",
    "the usual derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : time ] ) only applies to the quenched case , _",
    "i.e. _ to a scatterer configuration that is fixed in time . however , the arguments we give in appendix a show how to extend it to the annealed case as well .",
    "numerical experiments confirm this finding , for both quenched and annealed disorder . in fig .",
    "[ mfp ] we display the results for quenched disorder , since the annealed data are identical .",
    "the slab is infinite in the @xmath2 direction and the collisions are elastic , hence every particle that enters the slab must eventually leave it , except for a set of zero measure which goes asymptotically to bounded orbits inside the slab . thus , in practice , a particle that enters the slab collides with some of the obstacles and is ultimately transmitted or reflected . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : time ] ) one can obtain the average residence time @xmath26 as a function of @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 , if one now takes the border of the slab as the boundary segment . for a slab with @xmath0 columns and",
    "@xmath20 rows the perimeter is @xmath27 and the total area of the domain is as before .",
    "hence @xmath28 this equation defines the quantity @xmath29 . as above ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mfp ] ) ) , the result is independent of @xmath20 .",
    "we verified numerically the linear growth of @xmath5 with @xmath0 and found it to be valid , as expected , also for small values of @xmath0 . from these experiments we obtained the values of @xmath29 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] for quenched disorder together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : average - time ] ) .",
    "the agreement in the annealed case ( not shown ) is even more satisfactory .",
    "note that @xmath29 does not diverge as @xmath30 , as opposed to the mean free path .",
    "let us now compare these exact results with the predictions of a model based on brownian motion .",
    "we assume that the particles incident from the left penetrate a given distance @xmath31 into the sample , after which they forget everything about the way they were injected into the system and diffuse with diffusion constant @xmath32 . under these assumptions ,",
    "the quantities of interest can be evaluated exactly in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 and compared with the exact results obtained above .",
    "thus , the average time to reach either side starting at a distance @xmath31 from the left side is given by  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the horizontal separation between columns of the slab .",
    "one sees therefore that the form of the @xmath0 dependence in the diffusive case is slightly different from the exact one , eq .",
    "( [ eq : average - time ] ) , since in that case the proportionality to @xmath0 is exact over the whole range of @xmath0 . on the other hand , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : av - time - diff ] ) , a constant term appears which is negligible in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "since this is the limit for which diffusion is expected to be a valid description , this is not a serious problem . on the other hand , this allows to evaluate the ratio @xmath36 exactly in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath8 , via @xmath37 it is well known that it is not possible to obtain exact evaluations of the same sort for the diffusion constant @xmath32 , since its value can be shown to depend in a detailed manner on the specific dynamics involved .",
    "indeed , @xmath38 where the bar denotes an average over the realizations of the disorder . from this",
    "it follows that an analytical expression for @xmath32 in terms of simple phase space expressions is impossible .",
    "however , an order of magnitude estimate for @xmath32 can be given .",
    "since the mean square distance grows linearly with time , and since the only microscopic length scale is the mean free path , we are led to estimate @xmath39 by the square of the mean free path , where @xmath40 is the time needed for the particle to cover a mean free path . in our system , the velocity of the particle is constant and equal to one , therefore the result is that @xmath32 is of the same order as @xmath31 , both being of the order of the mean free path .",
    "this is indeed consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio - a - d ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio of the two dynamics dependent quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 depends only on the geometric features of the system .",
    "let us now turn to another average transport property , for which no exact expression is available , namely the transmission probability @xmath3 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "one finds that asymptotically , in the limit @xmath41 , @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] , we show that @xmath43 grows almost linearly with @xmath15 , for large values of @xmath15 .",
    "this can readily be understood in terms of the diffusive model .",
    "indeed , in the case of a diffusing particle being injected at a distance @xmath31 from the left - hand side of the slab , the probability that it be transmitted to the right - hand side without being absorbed first at the left - hand side @xmath44 is well - known to be  @xcite @xmath45 from this we see that @xmath43 can be identified with a quantity which , as argued above , is expected to scale as the mean free path .",
    "note further that whereas @xmath5 and @xmath15 are identical in the quenched and annealed cases , this is not true for the transmission probability , which shows significant differences for the two forms of disorder .",
    "we have also studied the distributions of residence times of transmitted ( respectively reflected ) particles , of free paths and of the heights at which transmitted ( respectively reflected ) particles leave the system .    of these , only the distribution of free paths is accessible to exact theoretical treatment . indeed , this is nothing but an equilibrium property , and can in principle be evaluated using an integral over the perimeter of the billiard with the birkhoff measure .",
    "however , this is not really practicable , so we have not attempted it .",
    "the distribution of mean free paths is quite irregular ( see fig .",
    "[ mfp - dist ] ) .",
    "this irregularity arises from the presence of resonances and the fact that there are forbidden distances .",
    "note that , as remarked in the introduction , the distribution decays exponentially since the horizon is finite . from the above characterization of the mean free path distribution as an equilibrium property",
    ", it readily follows that they are independent of whether the average is taken as quenched or annealed .",
    "now let us consider the distribution of residence times , which is not susceptible of an exact evaluation .",
    "however , it can be computed in the diffusion model .",
    "it is clearly sufficient to compute the distribution of residence times for transmitted particles @xmath46 upon starting at @xmath31 , since the corresponding distribution for reflected particles @xmath47 arises by substituting @xmath31 by @xmath48 in @xmath46 .",
    "defining the scaled variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the final result is , as shown in appendix b  @xcite @xmath51 integrating , one obtains eq .",
    "( [ eq : av - time - diff ] ) for the average time a diffusing particle takes to reach either side .",
    "we fit this to the numerical data as follows : one first considers the average time that a transmitted particle remains in the sample .",
    "this is obtainable from the experimental distribution on the one hand , but is also given by @xmath52 this allows therefore a determination of @xmath32 from the data , which for @xmath7 is in good agreement with published data  @xcite . from this and eq .",
    "( [ eq : average - time ] ) together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : av - time - diff ] ) , one also obtains a value of the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "one is then in a position to plot the theoretical curve eq .",
    "( [ eq : time - distribution ] ) together with the empirical data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time - distribution ] , for an occupation fraction @xmath53 .",
    "the agreement is quite good .",
    "the apparent shift between the theoretical curve and the data in reflection can be traced back to an issue of normalization involving particles reflected after a very few bounces , which therefore do not show diffusive behavior .",
    "thus , the empirical distribution has a short - time cut - off at larger times than the corresponding diffusive model .",
    "finally , we measure the distribution of heights of transmitted particles .",
    "this distribution can be computed in the diffusive model .",
    "the result for transmitted particles is , as shown in appendix b , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the scaled height @xmath56 and @xmath57 is as above . in fig .",
    "[ height - dist ] we show @xmath58 for transmitted particles .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "we do not show the behavior for reflected particles as it is dominated by rapid reflections .",
    "summarizing , we have studied transport properties of finite size samples of lorentz gases in a situation in which the mean free path can be varied over a large range of values without affecting the property of normal diffusion .",
    "the mean free path was varied over a considerable range ( slightly more than an order of magnitude ) , and the agreement with the brownian motion model was satisfactory throughout .",
    "we have also shown how the diffusion constant and the penetration depth , which were the two dynamical parameters of our model , vary with dilution , and hence with the mean free path .",

    "we introduce an arbitrary subset of the billiard boundary having perimeter @xmath18 , with the usual birkhoff coordinates as variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "one then finds @xmath76 from these two equations one derives eq .",
    "( [ eq : time ] )    the above remarks are clearly limited to the case of quenched disorder .",
    "the generalization to the annealed case can be made as follows : to every point @xmath63 on the poincar surface , add a doubly infinite sequence of zeroes and ones @xmath77 , which we denote by @xmath78 , with all @xmath79 independently distributed and equal to one with probability @xmath6 .",
    "we now define the dynamics as follows : the orbit starts from @xmath63 and the cell at @xmath80 is occupied or empty according to the value of @xmath81 .",
    "the orbit then proceeds until it leaves the cell .",
    "the status of the next cell is then decided according to the value of @xmath82 and so on .",

    "( [ eq : average ] ) is independent of @xmath78 , so that it is sufficient to average over the numerator .",
