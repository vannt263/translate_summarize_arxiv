    "a major systematic error in many studies of heavy - light meson decays has been the uncertainty due to chiral extrapolations in the light valence and light dynamical quark masses .",
    "these chiral extrapolation errors can be reduced significantly by working with light quark actions that have good chiral properties and this has motivated us to initiate a program to study heavy - light physics using improved staggered ( or equivalently improved naive ) light quarks coupled with nrqcd heavy quarks @xcite .",
    "our first results on @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson decay constants on the milc dynamical configurations were presented by m.wingate at this conference @xcite . here",
    "we discuss initial semileptonic decay results .",
    "our semileptonic studies are at a much more preliminary stage compared to the decay constant calculations .",
    "we report on quenched simulations with light quark mass around @xmath2 and the heavy quark mass around the @xmath3-quark mass .",
    "we employ the asqtad light quark action , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 improved nrqcd heavy quark action and the tree - level symanzik improved glue action .",
    "we work with 200 @xmath6 quenched configurations with @xmath7 gev .",
    "two- and three - point correlators involving naive or staggered propagators have contributions that oscillate with time and this makes it more challenging to carry out fits and extract groundstate contributions .",
    "experience gained recently with nrqcd / staggered heavy - light two - point correlators have demonstrated the usefulness of bayesian fitting methods @xcite .",
    "hence , much of the effort in this exploratory study of semileptonic decays has focused on testing bayesian fits to oscillatory three - point correlators .",
    "the basic correlator of interest is , @xmath8 in the present simulations the @xmath0 meson decays at rest ( @xmath9 ) and calculations have been performed with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the location of the current insertion @xmath12 was varied between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the three - point correlator is fit to the form ,    @xmath15    in this ansatz every second exponential comes with an oscillatory amplitude in both the pion and the @xmath0 channels , we were able to get good fits with @xmath16 or @xmath17 and @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore we found it useful to do simultaneous fits to @xmath20 and to the @xmath0 meson two - point correlator .",
    "fits were done to all data between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , i.e. to all but the first and the last timeslices , those timeslices on which the pion and the @xmath0 meson respectively were created . figs .",
    "1 & 2 give examples of fits to matrix elements of the temporal ( @xmath23 ) component of the heavy - light vector current .",
    "the plots show , @xmath24 . by factoring out the groundstate contributions ,",
    "the opposite parity oscillatory terms and other excited state contributions show up more clearly . despite the presence of these excitations ,",
    "the bayesian fitting methods allow us to extract the groundstate amplitude of interest , @xmath25 in eq.(2 ) .",
    "the two figures are for the cases when the pion has momentum @xmath26 in units of @xmath27 .",
    "good @xmath28 were found with @xmath16 and @xmath29 .",
    "the difference between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 results is typical for all matrix elements . with @xmath10 ,",
    "statistical errors are reduced and more accurate fits can be made .",
    "on the other hand , with @xmath11 a hint of a plateau can be observed ( which will likely disappear with higher statistics and a more expanded vertical scale ) . since with multi - exponential bayesian fits the presence of a plateau is not required , one is better off with the more accurate @xmath10 data",
    ". nevertheless , working with two different @xmath14 values provides a good consistency check , which we exploit in the next section .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm",
    "given the amplitudes @xmath25 from fits to three - point correlators one can determine various form factors . in these preliminary investigations",
    "we find it most convenient to work with the form factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 defined as , @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the groundstate amplitudes of the pion and @xmath0 correlators respectively .",
    "the @xmath35 are the matching coefficients for the heavy - light currents .",
    "we use one - loop perturbative results for them .    in fig.3",
    "we show results for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "our main results are the octagons and diamonds , which correspond to @xmath10 and @xmath11 results respectively , for decays into local goldstone pions .",
    "one sees consistency between the two @xmath14 results , with , as expected , smaller statistical ( and fitting ) errors when @xmath10 .",
    "we have also considered @xmath0 decays to one of the point - split non - goldstone pions , namely the one - link pion .",
    "the masses of the one - link and local pions differ as @xmath36 .",
    "the `` bursts '' in fig.3 show form factors for the decay to the one - link pion .",
    "one sees that at low momentum agreement is reasonable with the local pion results .",
    "things start to differ at higher pion momentum , however the data has started to deteriorate at those momenta and one also expects lattice artifacts to be worse there .",
    "things should improve considerably as one goes to lattices finer than the @xmath37gev lattices of the present study .",
    "one can conclude from fig.3 that taste - breaking lattice artifact errors are smaller in form factors than in the corresponding pion masses , particularly at low pion momenta .",
    "the above form factor results come from the lowest order ( in @xmath38 ) heavy - light currents .",
    "we have also analysed matrix elements of all the dimension 4 current corrections that come in at the next order ( two additional currents for @xmath23 and four more for @xmath39 ) .",
    "we find that their contributions are small for @xmath0 mesons giving at most a @xmath40% correction .",
    "exploratory quenched studies of heavy - light meson semileptonic decays with asqtad light quarks look promising .",
    "simulations are underway to calculate form factors on the milc dynamical configurations ."
