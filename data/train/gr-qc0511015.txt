    "rotating cosmological model @xcite , @xcite is one of the most interesting solutions of einstein s field equations with negative @xmath0-constant , particularly in view of its contribution to our understanding of rotation in relativity and its signs of causality breakdown due to the existence of closed timelike curves @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gdel solution is also of interest for a study of light ray caustics , which are basic for a discussion of the strong lensing effects in the universe @xcite,@xcite .",
    "there are now many papers discussing singularities on characteristic manifolds of the einstein field equations , mainly based on powerful mathematical theorems of lagrangian and legendrian maps @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one may also mention an older article by laurent , rosquist and sviestins @xcite , where the cone of an ozsvth class iii metric @xcite was studied .",
    "this metric already includes the gdel metric as a particular case .",
    "focal subsets ( caustics ) are likely to be present on null hypersurfaces , if a weak energy condition holds for its lightlike generators ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , hence almost always in realistic astrophysical or cosmological situations .",
    "they have often a complicated structure and are an obstacle for attempts to solve the characteristic initial value problem for einstein s field equations numerically , since integration along null geodesics runs into difficulties at caustics @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it would be extremely helpful if existent algorithms could be modified or replaced to allow numerical processing through such singularities .",
    "a preliminary step is to study caustics in exact solutions of the field equations .    in this connection",
    "the gdel light cone could be a useful object , since here the behaviour of light rays is already sufficiently complex to give an impression of features which we can expect in more realistic geometries , and on the other side it is simple enough to allow a complete analytical treatment . due to the five - dimensional group of isometries admitted by the gdel metric , which has a four - dimensional transitive subgroup , all light cones have the same internal structure .",
    "a first discussion of the inner geometry of the gdel cone was given by us in 1972 @xcite , @xcite , based on the integration of geodesics performed by kundt in 1956 @xcite .",
    "use of computer based formula manipulation technique has shown , that a number of complicated relations can be simplified considerably .",
    "in particular , the structure of caustics and the resulting startling cyclic lens effects found in @xcite and @xcite now became more transparent .",
    "the lens effects arise from a quasi - periodic re - focussing of the generators and are surprisingly similar to those discussed by for the light cone of a plane gravitational wave propagating in vacuum , one of their anti - mach metrics @xcite .",
    "we apply the geometrical decription of null hypersurfaces developped in @xcite,@xcite . after integrating the null geodesics in section",
    "ii , we derive the intrinsic metric of the gdel cone in section iii , calculate and discuss its rotation coefficients and differential invariants in section iv and turn to a description of caustics in section v. while rotation coefficients of the light ray congruence forming the cone have as a rule singularities on focal surfaces or keel points , some local inner differential invariants have simple _ finite _ limits there .",
    "it is interesting that this feature - with the same asymptotic values of invariants at singularitites - has shown up in all nontrivial light cones studied so far by us .",
    "a method to relate intrinsic cone coordinates to the angles @xmath1 on the observer sky is described in an appendix .",
    "gdel s stationary solution of einstein s field equations with cosmological constant describes the gravitational field of a uniform distribution of rotating dust matter , where - loosely speaking - the gravitational attraction of matter and the added attractice force of a negative @xmath0-constant is compensated by the centrifugal force of rotation . hawking and",

    "the integrals depend on four parameters @xmath8 and are subject to the normalization condition @xmath9 , where the constant is -1 for a timelike , 1 for a spacelike and 0 for a null geodesic . for the null geodesics discussed here ,",
    "different values of @xmath10 correspond only to different definitions of the affine parameter , so we assume @xmath11 subsequently . with ( [ te])-([ze ] ) , the normalization condition becomes for null geodesics ( x - c_1)^2+(y - c_2)^2 = c_2 ^ 2- c_3 ^ 2 c_4 ^ 2 , [ null ] thus the projection of null geodesics into the @xmath12-plane",

    "its explicit form helps to answer questions on null geodesics in the gdel cosmos .",
    "for example , one can easily conclude that there are no closed null geodesics , which would require @xmath28 for some values @xmath25 and @xmath29 : taking first @xmath30 , equation ( [ gz ] ) shows that @xmath31 or @xmath32 is needed , which corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "an inspection of the relation for @xmath34 shows , that these relations can be satisfied by means of periodic functions .",
    "thus a subset of null geodesics may return to the same space point , but the point is ( repeatedly ) reached at _ different _ times @xmath35 , due to the aperiodic term proportional to @xmath25 in ( [ gt ] ) .",
