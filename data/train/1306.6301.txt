    "coupling between an open quantum system and its environment is typically assumed to lead to markovian processes in which information flowing from the open system to the environment never returns  @xcite .",
    "although this is the most commonly studied scenario , non - markovian processes can have a prominent role under certain conditions .",
    "this can be the case , for example , if the system  environment coupling is strong , the reservoir is structured or has a finite size , or the temperature is low . detailed characterization of non - markovian processes is therefore called for , but difficulties in finding a proper definition for quantum non - markovianity have complicated this task considerably .",
    "due to recent advancements in the definition and quantification of quantum non - markovianity  @xcite , interest in non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems has increased rapidly . for an overview of topics discussed in this context see , for example ,",
    "@xcite .",
    "a commonly used approximation in the theory of open quantum systems is the removal of terms that oscillate fast with respect to some characteristic time scales of the system .",
    "there are two distinct ways to implement this type of an approximation .",
    "one is based on dropping the rapidly oscillating terms from the interaction picture hamiltonian  @xcite , whereas in the other approach these terms are removed from the interaction picture master equation for the reduced density operator  @xcite . in the following we refer to the former as the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) and to the latter as the secular approximation ( sa )  @xcite . in the theory of open quantum systems , the sa is often used in combination with the markov approximation to render the master equation in the lindblad form .",
    "the validity of the rwa has been studied by many authors , while that of the sa seems to have received less attention .    in the early 1970s agarwal studied spontaneous emission from a collection of identical two - level systems , finding that the rwa gives an erroneous frequency shift in the energy levels of the two - level systems  @xcite .",
    "this problem does not arise if the sa is used  @xcite .",
    "ford and oconnell discovered that , in general , the energy spectrum of an rwa hamiltonian is not bounded from below  @xcite .",
    "_ found that the terms neglected in the rwa and sa may have experimentally measurable effects on the dynamics of a quantum harmonic oscillator  @xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "zheng _ et al .",
    "_ showed that the zeno time of the quantum zeno effect is two orders of magnitude longer and the anti - zeno effect disappears if the rwa is not used  @xcite . in 2012",
    "larson argued that the berry phase appearing in certain cavity quantum electrodynamics settings can be considered an artifact resulting from the use of the rwa  @xcite . in the same year , peano _ et al .",
    "_ found that the tunneling rate of a parametrically modulated oscillator can be exponentially increased by processes caused by terms disregarded in the rwa  @xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was discovered that the sa yields unphysical results in the context of cooper pair pumping .",
    "the sa has also been shown to lead to the breaking of very general conservation laws of some observables  @xcite and to spurious effects in the context of environment - assisted entanglement generation  @xcite",
    ". further discussion on the rwa and sa and more references are provided in ref .",
    "however , no detailed study on the effect of rwa and sa on non - markovian behavior exists .",
    "is non - markovianity in general as vulnerable to sa as the conservation of electric charge in the cooper pair pump  @xcite ?    in this paper , we consider the effects of the rwa and sa on non - markovian processes occurring in the spin boson model at zero temperature . we quantify non - markovianity using the trace - distance - based measure defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and employ a master equation which has been derived without using the rwa or sa .",
    "the non - markovianity arising from this type of a master equation has been discussed previously in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of the trace - distance - based non - markovianity measure as a function of the temperature of the environment and the parameters of the spectral density was studied in the context of the spin - boson model .",
    "however , the effects of the rwa and sa were not considered , which prevented the authors from arriving at the conclusions of this work . in @xcite ,",
    "the trace - distance - based non - markovianity measure was compared with the divisibility - based measure ( see  @xcite ) in the spin - boson model at zero temperature .",
    "however , the optimization over initial - state pairs appearing in the definition of the non - markovianity measure was not carried out . in this paper",
    ", we perform the optimization and find out that the value of the measure can be orders of magnitude greater than previously predicted .",
    "strikingly , we show that the rwa and sa lead to a dramatic reduction in the value of the measure .",
    "this is because the rapidly oscillating terms omitted in these approximations are responsible for the major part of non - markovian dynamics .",
    "moreover , we illustrate that if these rapidly oscillating terms are not dropped , an analytical expression for the value of the non - markovianity measure can be derived straightforwardly . with the help of this expression ,",
    "the properties of the non - markovianity measure can be studied without having to explicitly solve the dynamics of the system .",

    "the main result of this paper is that the rwa and sa can lead to a dramatic reduction in the amount of non - markovianity detected by a commonly used non - markovianity measure .",
    "hence , although the rwa and sa are often considered to be justifiable approximations , they should be used with caution if quantifying non - markovianity is of interest .",

    "we showed that the rapidly oscillating terms that are neglected in the rwa and sa contribute to non - markovian dynamics during the whole relaxation time of the system , whereas if the rwa or sa is used , non - markovian dynamics takes place only in a time interval whose length is on the order of the reservoir correlation time @xmath30 . in the limit of a weak system - environment interaction ,",

    ", we derived an analytical expression for the non - markovianity measure for a general spectral density .",
    "remarkably , this expression can be given in terms of the asymptotic @xmath197 values of the coefficients of the master equation , without solving the dynamics of the system . since",
    "knowing the asymptotic values is sufficient , the markov approximation has a negligible effect on the non - markovianity if neither the rwa nor the sa is employed .",
    "we confirmed the validity of the analytical formula for non - markovianity numerically . with the help of this analytical result",
    ", we showed that , generally , the lorentzian and ohmic spectral densities lead to nonvanishing non - markovianity .",
    "however , the dynamics is approximately markovian if the value of the spectral density is maximized at a frequency corresponding to the energy separation of the two - level system .",
    "we argued that this a general phenomenon that occurs for a large class of spectral densities .",
    "we also found that the value of the non - markovianity measure depends only very weakly on the strength of the system - environment interaction in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "we showed that this results from the infinite upper bound of the time integral appearing in the definition of the non - markovianity measure .",
    "we argued that the pair of initial states maximizing the non - markovianity corresponds to two antipodal points on the equator of the bloch sphere .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the rwa and sa master equations that lead to maximal non - markovianity if the points are at the poles of the bloch sphere .",
    "furthermore , the non - markovianity of the dynamics depends on the initial phases of the off - diagonal elements of the density operators .    in the future",
