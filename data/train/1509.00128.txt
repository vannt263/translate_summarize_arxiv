    "although they lack a convective outer envelope , a subset of massive rapidly rotating stars , aka @xmath0 ori e analogs , exhibit strong magnetic fields ( 10s of @xmath3 @xcite ) , which act to confine their winds into a circumstellar disk .",
    "the rigidly rotating magnetosphere ( rrm ) model @xcite is the leading theoretical framework to explain the distribution of matter in these systems . while the rrm model , along with accounting for the effects of an inhomogeneous distribution of elemental abundances in the photosphere , does explain many of the qualitative features of these systems such as the general periodic behavior of line profile morphologies , light curve variations , and longitudinal magnetic field variations , discrepancies in the observed versus predicted line profile morphologies and light curves at specific phases suggest that model is missing important physics .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , details such as additional scattering that takes place around the magnetosphere and the shape of high density concentrations of disk material ( see also @xcite ) may need to be better described within models to achieve better agreement with observational data .",
    "attempts to further refine our understanding of @xmath0 ori e analogs are hampered by the relatively small numbers of such systems identified to - date , and the sparse availability of multi - epoch datasets for confirmed analogs .",
    "moreover , the availability of robust multi - wavelength datasets for such systems remains limited , especially in the infrared where only a few exploratory investigations have been performed @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recently identified at least two new likely @xmath0 ori e analogs via analysis of sdss iii / apogee @xcite spectroscopic observations , thereby increasing the number of such systems known by @xmath110% .",
    "one of these candidate analogs , hd 345439 , is a he rich b2v star that was reported to have @xmath4 = 270 @xmath5 20 km s@xmath6 , making it one of the fastest rotating rrm systems observed @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite used vlt / fors2 spectropolarimetric observations to explore the magnetic field properties of the system and while no magnetic field was found in the total dataset , the longitudinal magnetic field varied by 1@xmath3 over the 88 minutes of integration , suggesting the presence of a rapidly varying magnetic field . @xcite",
    "suggest this could be consistent with hd 345439 having a rotation period significantly shorter than 1 day .",
    "the other candidate analog , hd 23478 , is a he normal b3iv star with a reported @xmath4 = 125 @xmath5 20 km s@xmath6 , and a photometric period of 1.0498 days @xcite .",
    "recent spectropolarimetric observations of the system have confirmed the presence of a weakly variable longitudinal magnetic field of @xmath7 b@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath1 -2.0 @xmath3 in the system , along with periodically variable h@xmath2 emission and he i absorption @xcite , indicating the system is indeed a @xmath0 ori e analog .    in this paper , we present multi - epoch optical and infrared spectroscopic and optical photometric observations of hd 345439 and multi - epoch infrared spectroscopic observations of hd 23478 .",
    "these data help to identify likely rotational periods ( hd 345439 ) , characterize the confinement of material in their circumstellar disks ( hd 345439 and hd 23478 ) , and detail the level of he i variability present ( hd 345439 ) that could help diagnose surface abundance anomalies when combined with future detailed modeling .",
    "seventeen epochs of optical spectra of hd 345439 were obtained using the astrophysical research consortium echelle spectrograph ( arces ) on the apache point observatory s ( apo ) @xmath10 m telescope between 2012 september 2 and 2014 june 13 ( see table [ tab : observation_table ] ) .",
    "arces @xcite is a high resolution , cross - dispersed visible light spectrograph that obtains r@xmath131,500 spectra between 3600 - 10000 @xmath11 .",
    "we observed bias , flat field , and thar lamp exposures for the echelle on every night .",
    "these data were reduced using standard techniques in iraf , and individual spectral lines of interest were continuum normalized using the iraf task _",
    "continuum_.      we obtained six epochs of ir spectra of hd 345439 from 0.95 - 2.46@xmath12 m using triplespec on apo s 3.5 m telescope on 2013 july 14 ( see table [ tab : observation_table ] ) .",
    "these data were obtained with the 1@xmath131 x 43@xmath130 slit in standard abba observing mode , yielding r@xmath13500 spectra .",
    "we obtained spectra of the nearby a0v star hd 189690 after each observational sequence of hd 345439 to facilitate accurate telluric correction .",
    "these data were reduced and telluric corrected using triplespectool , a modified version of spextool @xcite .",
    "we also analyzed sixteen epochs of high resolution ( r@xmath14 ) , h - band spectra ( 1.51451.6960 @xmath12 m ) of hd 23478 ( see table [ tab : observation_table ] ) observed with the 300-fiber apogee instrument on the sdss 2.5 m telescope@xcite , and released as part of the sdss data release 12 ( dr12 ) @xcite .",
    "the reduction of apogee data and details of the sdss data release 12 ( dr12 ) spectra used are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data for hd 23478 from the `` blue '' and `` green '' apogee detectors @xcite exhibit clear signatures of saturation and were excluded from our analysis .",
    "we analyzed 2392 photometric observations of hd 345439 obtained by the kilodegree extremely little telescope ( kelt ) north transit survey @xcite taken between 2007 may 30 and 2013 june 13 .",
    "kelt consists of a 42 mm lens imaging a 26@xmath15 @xmath16 26@xmath15 field of view onto a 4000 @xmath16 4000 pixel ccd .",
    "kelt uses a red - pass filter with a 50% transmission point at 490 nm , which , when folded with the ccd response , yields an effective bandpass similar to r , but broader ( see section 2.1 of @xcite ) . after flat - fielding",
    ", relative photometry was extracted using a heavily modified version of the isis image subtraction package @xcite , combined with point - spread fitting photometry using daophot @xcite ( see section 2.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the final kelt light curve had a typical relative photometric precision of  2% .",
    "we supplemented these kelt photometric observations of hd 345439 with archival photometric data from the super wide angle search for planets ( superwasp ; @xcite ) and the all sky automated survey ( asas ; @xcite ) .",
    "superwasp observed the system over a span of 67 nights in 2007 , providing 979 epochs of photometry in a broad white light filter , with an average photometric uncertainty of 0.02 magnitudes .",
    "asas obtained 221 epochs of photometric observations of the system from 2003 - 2009 in the i - band , with a typical average photometric uncertainty for hd 345439 of 0.04 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite suggested that hd 345439 was among the most rapidly rotating @xmath0 ori e - type stars based on its observed @xmath4 value ( 270 @xmath5 20 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "we further explore the rotational rate of this star by examining all of the available kelt photometry for the system , and computing lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodograms @xcite of the data to search for evidence of periodicity .",
    "we searched for periodic signatures both in the individual kelt seasons as well as in the full kelt light curve in the period between 0.1 and 5.0 days .",
    "the most prominent ls peak occurred at 0.7701 @xmath50.0003 days ( figure [ kelt_fig ] ) ; we note that other suggested periods disappear after the data is whitened .",
    "phase - folding our kelt photometry by this suggested 0.7701 day period ( figure [ kelt_fig ] ) and binning these data , we see the clear signature of small amplitude ( @xmath122 mmag ) periodic variations that rise above the errors of each bin ( mean binned error @xmath116 mmag ) .",
    "the zero point of the ephemeris , with phase = 0 corresponding to the first minimum in the lightcurve , occured at jd = 2454251.3432 .",
    "we also analyzed the available asas and superwasp archival photometry of the system in a similar manner .",
    "we found a period of 0.7695 @xmath50.0078 days in the superwasp data ( figure [ kelt_fig ] ) .",
    "folding these data by this phase and computing median flux values in bins of 0.05 phase produced the phased - folded light curve for the superwasp data shown in figure [ kelt_fig ] .",
    "computing a ls periodogram for the asas data revealed evidence of a periodic signal at 0.7702 @xmath5 0.0001 days ( figure [ kelt_fig ] ) . to aid the visual interpretation of this light curve we again computed median flux values in bins of 0.05 phase and overlayed these median values on the asas phase - folded light curve shown in figure [ kelt_fig ] .",
    "note that the mean binned error ranges from @xmath116 mmag ( superwasp ) to @xmath127 mmag ( asas ) .",
    "each individual photometric dataset for hd 345439 yields the same ls peak signal ( to within @xmath150 seconds ) .",
    "moreover , the phase - folded light curves of the superwasp , asas , and kelt data ( figure [ kelt_fig ] ) exhibit the same basic morphology , albeit with low snr for the asas data .",
    "this consistency indicates the complex morphology observed is in fact real , and the period of the system is @xmath10.7701 days .",
    "we compute equivalent width ( ew ) line strengths for select major lines from continuum normalized data . because the observed line profiles were often complex , we computed ews by intregrating over the full profile of each line rather than fitting each profile with a functional form .",
    "we compile all of our measured optical and ir ews in table [ tab : observation_table ] , along with their errors , computed using the technique discussed in @xcite .",
    "although not included in the formal error bars , we suggest that continuum normalization placement uncertainties could add an additional @xmath15% to our quoted errors .    the ews of numerous emission and absorption lines in hd 345439 exhibit clear evidence of variability which is phase - dependent .",
    "our optical spectra for hd 345439 cover 60% of the phase - space of the system ; the periodic behavior of the h@xmath2 ew is indicative of circumstellar gas confined by the system s suspected magnetic field ( figure [ be50phase ] ) .",
    "although comparatively our ir data cover a smaller portion of phase - space , these data ( e.g. br-11 , figure [ be50phase ] ) exhibit a similar general trend with phase as for h@xmath2 .",
    "we find weak evidence for periodic behavior in the he i 4144 , 4387 , 4921 , 5015 , and 6678   lines ( a subset of these lines are shown in figure [ be50phase ] ) , albeit with opposite amplitude as observed in h@xmath2 .",
    "whereas the observed h@xmath2 ew variations likely arise from magnetospherically confined gas , determining the cause of the he i ew variations is more challenging .",
    "when he i ew variations exhibit clearly different trends as a function of phase than h@xmath2 , this has been attributed to differences in photospheric surface abundances ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however when he i ew variations exhibit similar trends as a function of phase as h@xmath2 , such behavior could arise both from photospheric surface abundance differences and due to occultations of the photosphere by the circumstellar disk @xcite . determining the role of anisotropic photospheric surface abundances and occultations by the disk in forming hd",
    "345439 s observed he i ew behavior will require additional observations that enable elemental abundance mapping ( e.g. @xcite ) and detailed modeling of the system .",
    "we further explore hd 345439 s circumstellar material by investigating dynamical spectra of our data .",
    "we first consider our data from 2013 july 14 , whereby we obtained near - contemporaneous optical and ir time series spectra of hd 345439 throughout @xmath140% of its orbital phase .",
    "figure [ be50halpha ] illustrates the dynamical spectrum for the h@xmath2 , h i br-11 , and h i br-@xmath17 lines ; note that we used an idl - based nearest - neighbor linear interpolation routine to connect neighboring observations .",
    "the evolution of each profile is clearly correlated with phase and is expected for a magnetically confined disk whose orientation with respect to us changes as the system rotates .",
    "figure [ be50halpha ] illustrates that in the last two epochs of our observations , the h@xmath2 line still exhibits a broad double - peaked profile , albeit the level of emission has decreased , especially on the blue - shifted of the profile .",
    "the ir lines ( br-11 and br-@xmath17 ) similarly weaken during these last two epochs , especially the blue - shifted region of the h i line profiles",
    ". moreover , the red - shifted emission component seems to signifcantly broaden in the final two epochs , essentially merging with the residual lower intensity remnant of the blue - shifted profile .",
    "such behavior is not simply limited to these two ir lines , but rather occurs across all h i emission lines in our h - band data .",
    "@xcite recently presented a detailed optical spectropolarimetric study of hd 23478 in which they were able to both constrain the magnetic field properties of the system and confirm the presence of a magnetospherically confined disk via analysis of select optical absorption and emission lines .",
    "our new 16 epochs of observations of the h i br-11 line in the h - band help to fill in the phase - space explored by @xcite . after continuum normalizing the spectra using standard techniques in iraf , we computed ews for our hd 23478 data , and phased them using the known 1.0498 day period and ephemeris @xcite .",
    "our measurements , compiled in table [ tab : observation_table ] and plotted in figure [ be75apogee ] , exhibit clear phase - locked periodic behavior similar in morphology to that observed at h@xmath2 ( see e.g. figure 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "a differential dynamical spectrum for hd 23478 , computed using our full 16 epochs of h i br-11 data spanning @xmath11.5 years and phased to the system s 1.0498 day period , illustrates that the overall morphology , especially the red - shifted side of the emission line profile , remained similar for more than 500 orbital periods .",
    "there is some evidence for subtle changes in the line profile morphology between orbital periods via some of the `` choppiness '' in regions of the differential dynamical spectra with closely ( in phase ) spaced observations",
    ". this might be indicative of small changes in the density of confined circumstellar gas over time .",
    "hd 345439 has been suspected to be a rapidly rotating @xmath0 ori e - type analog , based on the basic properties of its discovery sdss iii / apogee h - band spectrum and single - epoch follow - up spectra in the optical and ir @xcite as well as the suggestive presence of a rapidly variable magnetic field in the system @xcite .",
    "our analysis of @xmath92500 epochs of photometry of the system from three independent surveys has consistently revealed the presence of a 0.7701 day photometric periodic signal ( figure [ kelt_fig ] ) .",
    "we note that the morphology of the light curve clearly deviates from a simple sinusoidal shape and instead exhibits evidence of twice per period dimmings of the central star , which is expected when magnetospherically confined disk material occults the central star .",
    "moreover , the observed deviation from simple sinusoidal phase symmetry has been observed in other @xmath0 ori e - type systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we can not however rule out that pulsations also play a role in producing the observed light curve morphology , particularly in light of the highly varying spectropolarimetric data of @xcite .",
    "if however this 0.7701 day periodicity corresponds to hd 345439 s rotational period as we suggest , this would indicate hd 345439 is rotating significantly faster than the benchmark for this class of stars , the 1.19 day period of @xmath0 ori e @xcite .",
    "moreover , it would place hd 345439 instead closer to the fastest analogs of the class , hr 7355 ( 0.52 days ; @xcite ) and hr 5907 ( 0.508 days ; @xcite ) .",
    "our multi - epoch optical and ir spectra have confirmed that both the h i emission line strengths and profiles and he i absorption line strengths exhibit phase - locked variations on this same periodic time - scale , providing confirmation that the system does have circumstellar material confined in a disk - like geometry , likely by the suspected magnetic field @xcite . as such , these data strongly support the original classification @xcite of hd 345439 as a @xmath0 ori e analog .",
    "although detailed modeling is beyond the scope of this manuscript , we consider the broad properties of the hd 345439 system based on the observed light curve morphology and line profile behavior .",
    "in particular , we qualitatively compare the properties of the hd 345439 system against the rigidly rotating magnetosphere model @xcite and the resultant light curve @xcite and spectroscopic behavior predicted by this model . using the interactive visualization movies by rrm model originator r. townsend , we suggest the observed `` w - shaped '' light curve morphology ( figure [ kelt_fig ] ) and h i line profile evolution ( figure [ be50halpha ] ) of hd 345439 is broadly consistent with the system having a moderately high inclination ( @xmath175@xmath15 ) and a moderate obliquity ( @xmath18 @xmath145@xmath15 )",
    ". detailed modeling of the system will require stronger constraints on the magnetic field properties of the system , beyond the observationally - based hint of a rapidly varying magnetic field in the system @xcite , as well as a better understanding of any anisotropies in its elemental surface abundances and the level to which they contribute to the observed broad - band light curves and he i ew behavior .",
    "@xcite used spectropolarimetric observations to derive the longitudinal magnetic field strength and begin to parameterize the variable optical h i emission and he i absorption associated with the hd 23478 system .",
    "our ir spectroscopic data confirmed the presence of confined circumstellar gas by the system s magnetic field and provided enhanced phase coverage of diagnostics of this gas .",
    "more broadly , our multiwavelength data advanced the exploration of optical and ir parameter space of @xmath0 ori e - type stars by @xcite .",
    "as these multiwavelength data probe different optical depths in the disk , small - scale differences between near - contemporaneous optical and ir line profiles ( e.g. the final two epochs of our optical and ir spectra of hd 345439 ; figure [ be50halpha ] ) could be used to help resolve the current uncertainties regarding the detailed morphology of magnetospherically confined disk material @xcite .",
