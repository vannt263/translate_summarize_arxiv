    "the difficulty to make compatible string theory with accelerating cosmologies has been studied in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the de sitter ( ds ) universe driven by a positive cosmological term , as well as quintessence dominated universes , posses event horizons ; as a consequence two physical systems can only be separated a finite distance , the distance of the event horizon ; then spatially asymptotic states can not exist and the s - matrix of interactions is not well defined .",
    "this fact contrasts with our understanding of string theory ; such a theory can be formulated only perturbatively where the initial asymptotically free states ( strings ) interact giving rise to a description of the final asymptotically free states in terms of an s - matrix .",
    "this is the case for an asymptotically flat background ; if the geometry is asymptotically anti - ds the asymptotic states are realized on the conformal theory on the boundary , following maldacena s conjecture @xcite . in general , gravitational backgrounds with horizons",
    "are not compatible with a hilbert space of infinite dimension like the hilbert space of string theory ; in fact when gravity is present the number of degrees of freedom that a system can support is proportional to the area of the system according to the holographic principle @xcite @xcite ; the event horizon , when present , is a natural place to project the relevant degrees of freedom living on the bulk .",
    "this theoretical difficulty contrasts with observations @xcite that , if confirmed , will prove that the observable universe accelerates . due to the attractive nature of the gravitational force for ordinary matter these observations",
    "are compatible only with a positive cosmological term , or with a sort of matter with negative pressure termed quintessence , that can be associated to the vacuum energy for an unstable scalar field evolving towards the minimum of its potential ; this sort of tachyonic instability can generate a vacuum energy with negative pressure , a limit of which being the ds solution .",
    "assuming an equation of state for the matter of the type @xmath0 , it can be shown that for an accelerating universe the range of @xmath1 is @xmath2 . for a friedman robertson walker ( frw )",
    "universe dominated by quintessence , @xmath1 is bounded by the previous values .",
    "@xmath3 corresponds to a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath4 ) and the subsequent geometry is the ds one . in @xcite and @xcite the formation of event horizons for the previous values of @xmath1 has been studied showing that it is difficult to avoid them and , although the observational data can be explained , it is not compatible with the string / m theory by the reasons commented above .    in spite that for positive cosmological constant @xmath5 , as well as for quintessence matter , the models of the universe both have event horizons , they are different . in the case of quintessence",
    "the horizon geometry is a cone with a singularity on the apex signaling the big bang singularity , the topology being @xmath6 .",
    "the ds horizon geometry however is a cylinder , @xmath7 , without the singularity in @xmath8 , and the distance to the horizon is constant and equal to @xmath9 so that the spatial limitation is constant during the cosmological time .",
    "however , the proper distance to the horizon for a quintessence dominated universe opens up with the cosmic time , being zero at the big bang and growing linearly as the time elapses ; the angle of the vertex of the horizon cone depends on the value of @xmath1 .    in the present research",
    "we study the presence of event horizons in a generic way for metrics of the robertson walker ( rw ) type ( spatially isotropic ) .",
    "in order to locate them we use a graphic representation that does not make use of the penrose diagrams and where the distances on the graphics are physical distances ( proper or coordinates ) ; concretely we represent the successive light cones of a fiducial observer comoving with the cosmic fluid , that we place in the origin , as well as the world lines of galaxies without peculiar velocity , that serve as fixed coordinate distance lines .",
    "another useful geometric element is the locus of comoving matter points that have a given , fixed proper velocity with respect to the fiducial observer as a function of cosmic time ( _ iso - velocity lines _ ) .",
    "this graphical representation is in some sense complementary to the conformal mappings that give rise to the penrose diagrams , and has been used previously @xcite with the aim of clarifying the concept of particle horizons , putting explicitly the presence of superluminal velocities between different comoving matter points of the fluid @xcite .",
    "the velocity of any object , _ locally _ must be smaller than @xmath10 , the velocity of light in vacuo ( locally , by the equivalence principle , the theory of special relativity applies ) , but for separated points , a non local measure , it is the theory of general relativity that governs the phenomena .    for the explicit and exact location of the event horizon in a homogeneous expanding cosmological model",
    "we need the explicit form of the scale factor @xmath11 generally deduced from the dynamic equations .",
    "but only with a basic information about the scale factor -without its explicit form- and by means of the three kinematical tools previously commented -past light cones , world line of galaxies and isovelocity lines- , can we determine the existence or not of event horizons .",
    "we find that the decelerating cosmological models do not have event horizon .",
    "however we also find a particular family of accelerated cosmological models that neither have event horizon .",
    "also we are able to give an approximate expression that asymptotes the event horizon with increasing cosmological time .",
    "the criteria that we will use to define the location of event horizons are associated with the history of a photon emitted by the galaxy towards the fiducial observer placed at the origin : when by its travel the photon goes over cosmic regions with increasing proper velocities with respect to the observer , then the emitted photon would never arrive to the origin ; in this case the galaxy is placed beyond the event horizon . on the contrary , if in its path the photon enters regions where the fluid velocity decreases ( always with respect to the origin ) the photon sooner or later hits the origin . in the border",
    "we encounter the horizon ( with respect to the observer ) that is placed where a emitted photon has a trajectory on constant cosmic fluid proper velocities ( with respect to the observer ) .",
    "we emphasize that no reference is made to the velocity of the source , that is arbitrary ; also we do not prejudge the accelerated or decelerated character of the universe .",
    "the article is organized in five parts .",
    "we begin with the present introduction . in the second part",
    "we discuss the graphical representation method and we apply it to the quintessence and the ds cases . in the third part we work in a generic cosmological setup and",
    "then we obtain general results about event horizons .",
    "finally we present our conclusions . in a mathematical appendix",
    "we develop the argument of the main result .",
    "in this section we begin by introducing the expressions that would be used along the article as well as the notation ( that otherwise will be standard ) ; then we use them to study the event horizons for ds and quintessence universes .",
    "the rw geometry is characterized by the line element    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the line element for the two dimensional unit sphere @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the spatial curvature .",
    "the coordinates are comoving with the cosmic fluid ; in particular @xmath16 is the cosmic time . the velocity of light is @xmath17 . due to the isotropy of the geometry ( in accordance with the cosmological principle )",
    "the origin is a generic point and we can fix one direction ( fixing the polar angles ) without loss of generality ; the metric takes then the form    @xmath18    where each point of the plane @xmath19 must be considered as a sphere of radius @xmath20 . instead of using the radial coordinate @xmath21 ,",
    "the events can be coordinated using the proper distance to the origin @xmath22 for a given time @xmath16 ; that is taking @xmath23 in ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) @xmath24 ; differentiating we have    @xmath25    substituting in ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) gives    @xmath26    each point in the plane @xmath27 continues to be a sphere of radius @xmath28 .",
    "let us remember the three ingredients we will use to fix the event horizons :    1 .",
    "the locus of the ingoing null geodesics ( ngs ) expressed in proper distance .",
    "concretely the * past light - cone * of a fiducial observer that we will place at the origin @xmath22 .",
    "the * world line of test galaxies * without peculiar velocity and its proper distance to the observer ( its coordinate distance @xmath21 will be constant ) .",
    "the proper distance to the origin , as a function of cosmic time , for the galaxies that move with a fixed proper velocity with respect to the observer : * isovelocity lines*. this last concept will be developed in the next section .    in order to determine the ngs and consequently the causal structure of the geometry we put @xmath29 in ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) , yielding @xmath30 here we put explicitly @xmath10 , the light velocity .",
    "@xmath28 measures the proper distance to the origin for a photon emitted by a galaxy with a given initial coordinates .",
    "there are two contributions to the velocity of the photon with respect to the observer in the origin : @xmath31 is the local velocity of light with respect to the geometrical background ; locally , as a consequence of the equivalence principle , the geometry is minkowskian and are valid the postulates of the theory of special relativity ; the photon moves with constant velocity @xmath10 respect to the surrounding matter , @xmath10 being an upper bound ; the two signs of the second term of ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) corresponds to the two possible directions away ( @xmath32 ) or towards ( @xmath33 ) the origin .",
    "the term @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the hubble constant ) represents the photon dragging as a consequence of the variation of the geometry with time ; the space - time geometry is not flat and special relativity does not apply , but the general one .",
    "( [ 2 - 5 ] ) shows that the photon velocity with respect to the origin can take arbitrary values ; ) we recover the newtonian sum of velocities ; this is a signal that the motion of comoving ( without proper velocities ) galaxies is due to the expansion of the space , not a motion _ on the space_. see @xcite . ]",
    "the arbitrariness is encoded in the functional form of the scale factor @xmath11 that depends on the way the geometry is governed by its coupling with matter ( ordinary or vacuum energy ) .",
    "the relation ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) is purely geometric . to obtain the causal structure of the space time explicitly we need to know the nature of the matter that couples to the geometry .",
    "we suppose that the substratum is an ideal fluid characterized by the equation of state @xmath36 . we restrict ourselves to the spatially flat case @xmath37 that seems to fit well with the observations @xcite",
    ". then the einstein equations in the frw form are @xmath38 @xmath39 the equation of continuity ( [ 2 - 7 ] ) is independent of the constant curvature of the spatial sections . using the equation of state",
    "we can integrate it and obtain the dependence of the density with the scale factor ; for @xmath40 constant we obtain @xmath41 the two frw equations can be recast , integrating ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) with the aid of ( [ 2 - 8 ] ) and differentiating ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) with respect to @xmath16 , with the following result @xmath42 @xmath43 the hubble constant is @xmath44 we observe that for @xmath45 the power law dependence of the scale factor ( [ 2 - 9 ] ) breaks down ; in fact for @xmath46 the fluid is equivalent to the presence of a positive cosmological constant and the appropriate model is the ds universe with an exponential expansion .",
    "the equation ( [ 2 - 10 ] ) proves that for @xmath47 the expansion ( @xmath48 ) is accelerating ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the range @xmath50 characterizes the quintessence .    to obtain the possible cosmological horizons the usual way to proceed",
    "is the following . given the matter that fills the universe , the @xmath40 that can depend on the cosmic time , we solve the equations ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) and ( [ 2 - 10 ] ) , and obtain the explicit solution for the scale factor @xmath11 . using the ngs of the metric ( [ 2 - 2 ] ) we determine the space - time regions that will never be observed and the proper distance to the event horizon as a function of @xmath16 : @xmath51    in order to determine the cosmological event horizons we use a slightly different method .",
    "first , we obtain from the metric ( given the explicit function @xmath11 ) the family of ingoing ngs that reach @xmath22 when @xmath52 , i.e. the family of past light cones for an observer at @xmath22 .",
    "we represent graphically this family of ingoing ngs using proper distances to coordinate them ; then we observe an accumulation of past light cones towards a limiting one that will trace the event horizon . beyond this limit",
    "the ingoing ng will never reach @xmath22 and then those space - time region would never be observed . in the following subsections",
    "we apply this procedure to the accelerating models , frw dominated for quintessence and ds , for the flat spatial case",
    ".     diverges , as for the black hole case .",
    ", width=529 ]      we integrate the ng differential equation ( [ 2 - 5 ] ) for the quintessence dominated universe . using the value of the hubble constant ( [ 2 - 11 ] ) we can write @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an integration constant ; forcing the light trajectory to be at a proper distance @xmath55 from the origin when the cosmic time is @xmath56 results in @xmath57           \\big({t \\over t_{0 } } \\big)^{2 \\over 3(1 + \\omega ) } \\ .\\ ] ] in this way",
    "we construct the two families of ngs , one with growing @xmath28 and the other with decreasing @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath58 according to ( [ 2 - 13 ] ) is the light cone for each point of the manifold @xmath59 .",
    "the families ( [ 2 - 13 ] ) determine the causal structure of the universe .",
    "the past light cone for the origin @xmath60 at time @xmath56 is given by @xmath61 \\ .\\ ] ] taking the derivative of the previous expression with respect to the cosmic time gives us the slope of the past light cone @xmath62 \\ ; \\ ] ] we see that @xmath63 is a decreasing function of @xmath16 , its maximum value occurs for @xmath8 ; because @xmath64 is positive for @xmath65 the slope of the light cone at the initial time is finite and is @xmath66 this means that the events that can influence the observer placed at the origin are limited to the cone with apex in the big bang and with an angle @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "to determine the event horizon we must compare the past light cone of the origin with the world lines of the galaxies .",
    "the recession of a galaxy that in @xmath56 is placed at @xmath55 is described by @xmath68 @xmath69 separates two regimes with different concavity for @xmath58 reflecting the accelerated / decelerated behavior of matter .",
    "the derivative of ( [ 2 - 17 ] ) with @xmath16 is @xmath70 ; this derivative at the origin is zero for the quintessence but diverges for @xmath71 ; the big bang for the quintessence is not big nor bang , however the quintessence density diverges for @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "now , it is clear that every pair of galaxies has been causally connected in the beginning of the expansion ; also it is clear that the same pair of galaxies would be causally disconnected when one of them crosses the event horizon of the other .",
    "the horizon grows linearly with the cosmic time according to @xmath74    for ordinary matter @xmath75 , @xmath76 .",
    "we can use ( [ 2 - 14 ] ) to study the future light cone ; taking @xmath77 and changing sign we obtain the spatial extension of the future light cone from the big bang i.e. the particle horizon , so that for ordinary matter , @xmath78 and for quintessence ( @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 ; particle and event horizons play a dual role ( see table [ tabla1 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] we show the world line for an arbitrary galaxy together with the past light cones of an observer placed at the origin ; in this way we visualize the event horizon which is also shown . beyond this limit all the ingoing ngs never reach @xmath81 and so we will never observe at @xmath81 the events covered by this ng .",
    "we have also depicted the same functions for ordinary matter ( @xmath71 ) in fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] . here",
    "the expansion is decelerated and as a consequence the slope of the past light cone at the initial time diverges ; we need an infinite amount of kinetic energy to overcome the ( also infinite ) amount of gravitational attraction ; the world line of a generic galaxy , having now contrary concavity to the quintessence , will intercept unavoidably the past light cone of the observer .    .",
    "we observe that the photons emitted by a galaxy ( grey line ) cross the isovelocity lines ( dashed lines ) always on the decreasing recession velocity sense .",
    "there are not real accumulation of past light cones indicating the absence of event horizons for this case ; for every space - time event @xmath82 there exists an ingoing ng reaching @xmath81.,width=377 ]      the same reasoning can be done for the case of a positive cosmological constant ( @xmath83 ) dominated universe .",
    "the ds model corresponds to an equation of state @xmath84 ( @xmath45 ) . for the frw equations ( [ 2 - 6 ] ) and",
    "( [ 2 - 7 ] ) it follows than the scale factor goes exponentially with time @xmath85 , and the continuity equation shows manifestly the constancy of the vacuum energy @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is an arbitrary scale factor for @xmath8 because the model , possessing an exponential expansion , is self similar .",
    "the hubble constant is in this case truly constant @xmath88 and the model is in agreement with the perfect cosmological principle .    to obtain the causal structure we need to know the past light cone of a generic observer as well as the world line of the galaxies .",
    "again we make use of the proper metric ( [ 2 - 4 ] ) and integrating the ngs we arrive to @xmath89 the previous expression is the light cone for an event placed at the point @xmath90 ; taking the origin @xmath91 @xmath92 at @xmath52 as our fiducial observer we see that such an event can be influenced by the events inside the region @xmath93 where obviously @xmath94 .",
    "one observes that the past light cone never extends to distances greater than @xmath95 .",
    "the world lines of galaxies have the form @xmath96 and in a finite cosmic time overtake proper distances with respect to the origin higher than @xmath95 . the proper distance @xmath95 is the event horizon for the observer placed at the origin and consequently for any observer .",
    "the geometry of the event horizon for the ds universe is cylindrical in front to the conical geometry for the quintessence dominated universe . in fig .",
    "[ figura1 ] we show the ds model with its causal structure ; we plot the successive past light cones from @xmath81 .",
    "a typical galaxy world line crossing the isovelocity lines has also been included .",
    "._event _ horizon , _ particle _ horizon , _ apparent _ horizon and the hubble distance for frw and ds flat cosmological models .",
    "we show also the behavior of the slope of the galaxy world line and past light cone near the big bang . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally we want to comment an interesting property .",
    "it can be shown that if the event horizon has an asymptote , then it is the unique ng having an asymptote .",
    "the rest of the ngs reconverge or recede without asymptote . using the lhpital heorem in the ng equation ( [ 3 - 2 ] ) we found that if @xmath97 then @xmath98 which is identical to ( [ 5-c ] ) and can be easily extrapolated to ( [ 5-a ] ) .",
    "so , for the cases a and c we can prescribe this rule : _ the event horizon is the unique ng having an asymptote and the asymptotic horizon has exactly the same asymptote_. this property could be used for a better delimitation of the event horizons by means of the legendre s transformation which relates a mathematical function to its family of tangent straight lines .",
