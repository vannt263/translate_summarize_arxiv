    "we have also calculated the angular power spectrum of 21  cm fluctuations due to loops with a scaling loop number density distribution .",
    "the larger @xmath15 is , the higher the spectrum amplitude due to loops becomes .",
    "the power spectrum is proportional to @xmath159 on large scales , while it is scale - invariant on small scales .",
    "the scale where the slope of the spectrum changes corresponds to the typical length scale of the filaments .",
    "the spectrum does not strongly depend on the observation redshift .",
    "we found that the amplitude of the spectrum due to the loops is larger than the one due to long strings evaluated in ref .",
    "therefore , the angular power spectrum of 21  cm fluctuations can give the limit on @xmath7 by measuring the spectrum due to loops . at @xmath3 , the angular power spectrum for @xmath188 can dominate the spectrum of the primordial density fluctuations .",
    "the amplitude due to the primordial fluctuations becomes smaller as the redshift decreases .",
    "hence , the amplitude of the spectrum even for @xmath167 can be larger than for the primordial density fluctuations at @xmath5 . however , first galaxies formed around @xmath189 produce the larger 21  cm fluctuations through the ly-@xmath190 flux and x - ray heating  @xcite .    comparing with the noise power spectrum of the 1 year ska - like observation ,",
    "we have found that the power spectrum for @xmath125 dominates the noise power spectrum at low multipoles ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the ska - like observation can measure the spectrum for @xmath192 with high signal to noise ratio .",
    "the amplitude of the spectrum depends on the loop number density distribution which is not completely understood .",
    "for example , the analytical work , ref .",
    "@xcite , suggested scaling loop distribution with small loop production . because of the difference in the distributions , we found that the angular power spectrum will be reduced by @xmath193 with the distribution in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the filaments produced by loops are gravitationally unstable , they will fragment into beads , which subsequently merge into larger beads as considered in ref .",
    "although we have not taken into account this effect in this paper , the fragmentation of the filaments decreases the amplitude of the spectrum on large scales and enhances on small scales .",
    "the evaluation of the power spectrum with the fragmentation effect requires a detailed study including numerical simulations .",
    "however , in order to evaluate the fragmentation effect roughly , we simply assume that the filaments collapse into beads with the filament width size which corresponds to the fastest growing instability mode and following mergers of beads makes the length of the beads ten times larger . under this assumption",
    ", we found that the amplitude of the spectrum is decreased by 0.1 on large scales and enhanced roughly by 6 on small scales .    in our calculation of the angular power spectrum ,",
    "we have only considered the contributions of small filaments whose virial temperature is below @xmath86k . in massive filaments with the virial temperature larger than @xmath86k , stars can be formed and ionize the surrounding igm gas  @xcite .",
    "the ionized gas can produce additional large 21  cm fluctuations .",
    "we will study the 21  cm power spectrum due to massive filaments in future work .",
