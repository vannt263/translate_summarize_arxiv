    "the concept of universality makes possible to understand and classify the various and complicate critical behavior of a number of equilibrium models @xcite . for nonequilibrium critical phenomena ,",
    "extensive studies during past decades revealed that various nonequilibrium systems also exhibit universal behavior characterized by several features @xcite .",
    "hence , it has been an important issue to identify nonequilibrim universality classes by finding common physical features .    among nonequilibrium",
    "critical phenomena , absorbing phase transitions ( apt s ) from fluctuating active states into absorbing states in which the system is trapped forever have been a field of growing interest during last decades @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and numerical studies show that apt s exhibit universality and it can be classified according to conservation laws , dimensionality of systems and symmetries of absorbing states @xcite .",
    "however only a few universality classes have been identified so far .",
    "directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite and parity conserving ( pc ) @xcite class are well studied classes among others .",
    "dp class includes systems with no special attributes except the time reversal symmetry , so that most systems studied so far belong to this class .    as a research direction to search for further unknown universality classes ,",
    "coupled systems have been studied recently @xcite .",
    "a coupled system is a multi - species system in which each species is coupled to the others in certain ways such as bidirectional and unidirectional coupling in linear or quadratic ways .",
    "however the coupled systems do not always exhibit new critical behavior . for bidirectionally coupled systems ,",
    "the critical behavior depends on the manner of the coupling .",
    "for instance , quadratically coupled dp systems still belong to dp class despite their complex behavior @xcite .",
    "however , linearly coupled systems belonging to dp or pc class exhibit mean - field or non - trivial critical behavior @xcite .",
    "linearly and unidirectionally coupled systems exhibit new critical behavior at multicritical point where all sub - systems are critical @xcite .    among single species systems ,",
    "pair contact process with diffusion ( pcpd ) can be regarded as a two species system .",
    "pcpd has been extensively studied during last years due to its nontrivial critical behavior ( see @xcite for review ) . however , in spite of extensive theoretical and numerical studies , the critical behavior is not clearly uncovered yet .",
    "pcpd is a stochastic reaction - diffusion model , which evolves by the competition of two processes , fission ( @xmath12 ) and annihilation ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "in addition , each particle performs isotropic diffusion . without diffusion ,",
    "the model is so - called pair contact process ( pcp ) belonging to dp class @xcite .",
    "since the reactions involve pairs , diffusing solitary particles are not engaged in the binary reactions .",
    "however when two solitary particles form a pair , the reactions take place .",
    "on the other hand , solitary particles are created from pairs by diffusion .",
    "hence , pcpd can be regarded as a bidirectionally coupled two species system in which the order of the coupling is linear in the direction from pairs to solitary particles and quadratic in the opposite direction .",
    "this observation leads to the cyclically coupled dp and pair annihilation which exhibits the similar type of critical behavior to that of pcpd @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the domain structure of pcpd .",
    "when a spreading domain is formed from localized initial activities , the quadratic coupling from solitary particles to pairs allows the pair - free region in which only solitary particles are present .",
    "we call the pair - free region so - called _ uncoupled _ region . on the other hand",
    ", the linear coupling from pairs to solitary particles results in the so - called _ coupled _ region in which pairs and solitary particles coexist .",
    "the pair - free region encloses the coupled region as shown in fig .",
    "[ pattern ] .",
    "hence , the spreading domain is divided into two regions , coupled and uncoupled region .",
    "this kind of double domain structure was found in unidirectionally coupled two level hierarchies @xcite . as shown in previous studies on unidirectionally coupled systems @xcite , the measurements of critical exponents are very difficult due to long - time drift of the exponents .",
    "the one reason of the drift is the generic feature of the unidirectional coupling @xcite , the other is the double domain structure @xcite . in measuring critical exponents , one can overcome the latter effect by measuring quantities in each region separately .",
    "( color online ) the double domain structure of pcpd . the region with size @xmath2 is the coupled region in which pairs ( blue ) and solitary particles ( red ) coexist .",
    "the region with size @xmath3 is the uncoupled region in which only solitary particles exist . ]    to explain the effect of the domain structure on the critical behavior , let us consider the unidirectionally coupled dp - pc coupling @xcite . in the dp - pc coupling , pc process ( @xmath14 ) is unidirectionally coupled with dp process ( @xmath15 ) via @xmath16 ( linear ) .",
    "since dp process spreads faster than pc process , the coupling changes the spreading behavior of pc process .",
    "there are no interactions between @xmath15 and @xmath14 species .",
    "starting with a single @xmath15 particle on @xmath15-level , a @xmath14-domain is form and spreads faster than a @xmath15-domain does due to the coupling . as a result",
    ", the uncoupled region where no @xmath15 particles exist is formed @xcite .",
    "the coupled region is just the region of @xmath14-domain overlapped with the @xmath15-domain where the coupling exists .",
    "hence , the size of the @xmath14-domain ( @xmath17 ) is the sum of the size of coupled ( @xmath18 ) and uncoupled region ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath19 . at the multicritical point where both species are critical , the size of each domain increases in power - law such as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since @xmath24 by definition ,",
    "the scaling of @xmath17 is given as @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants .",
    "a recent study showed @xmath28 for the fast spreading @xmath15-domain ( source ) @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath17 scales as @xmath29 asymptotically for faster spreading source @xmath15 , and @xmath3 plays the correction to the scaling of @xmath17 .",
    "since the difference @xmath30 is sufficiently small in the dp - pc coupling , the existence of the uncoupled region makes precise estimates of @xmath31 difficult within moderate simulation time . for the dp - pc coupling ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath32 is @xmath33 which is less than the expectation @xmath34 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the estimate of @xmath35 is @xmath36 which is compatible with the leading scaling .    as in unidirectionally coupled systems",
    ", it is expected that the double domain structure of pcpd also makes it difficult to identify the critical spreading behavior precisely .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the double domain structure on the critical spreading of pcpd and to estimate critical exponents more precisely .",
    "we consider the pcpd of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this model ,",
    "a randomly selected particle attempts to hop to one of the nearest neighbor sites with an equal probability . if the target site is empty , the attempt is accepted .",
    "however if the target site is occupied , ( i ) two particles annihilate with probability @xmath37 or ( ii ) the hopping attempt is rejected and the pair ( the chosen particle and one at the target site ) tries to create a particle at the randomly chosen nearest neighbor site of the pair .",
    "when the target site is occupied , the branching attempt is rejected .",
    "the critical point of this model is @xmath38 in one dimension @xcite .",
    "pcpd has three sectors in configuration spaces according to the existence of pairs(@xmath39 ) and solitary particles(@xmath40 ) .",
    "the one is the configurations in which both pairs and solitary particles are present ( @xmath41-ensemble ) .",
    "we call configurations with at least one pair ( two solitary particles ) @xmath39-ensemble ( @xmath40-ensemble ) . in @xmath39-ensemble ( @xmath40-ensemble ) ,",
    "solitary particles ( pairs ) may be present or not .",
    "the @xmath39-ensemble is the reactive subspace of ref .",
    "a conventional ensemble includes configurations with at least two particles which can be either two solitary particles or one pair .",
    "we call the conventional ensemble @xmath42-ensemble .",
    "since solitary particles are effectively linearly coupled to pairs , the existence of pairs implies the existence of solitary particles .",
    "hence , @xmath41-ensemble should coincide with @xmath39-ensemble asymptotically .",
    "however , solitary particles transform into pairs by collisions , the coupling in this direction is quadratic .",
    "hence , the existence of solitary particles does not always guarantee the presence of pairs due to the long life time of solitary particles .",
    "so @xmath40-ensemble coincide with @xmath42-ensemble . as a result , there are two distinct ensembles in pcpd .",
    "we define the size of each domain as follows ( see fig .  [ pattern ] ) .",
    "the size of the whole domain at time @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is defined as the distance between the leftmost and the rightmost particle . when both pairs and solitary particles exist simultaneously",
    ", we can define the size of the coupled region ( @xmath51 ) and the size of the uncoupled region ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "since solitary particles are linearly coupled to pairs , we define the size of the coupled region ( @xmath53 ) as the spreading distance of pairs ( @xmath2 ) defined as the distance between the leftmost and the rightmost pair .",
    "then , @xmath52 is given as @xmath54 .",
    "hence , we have three different lengths , @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 in pcpd . to take into account the three length scales at the same time ,",
    "one should use @xmath41-ensemble in which only two lengths , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fundamental length scales of pcpd due to @xmath5 .      at @xmath59 , we perform defect monte carlo simulations with a pair on one dimensional empty lattice .",
    "we run simulations up to @xmath60 time steps using @xmath61 independent runs .",
    "we measure the squared sizes , @xmath43 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for surviving @xmath41-ensemble .",
    "the pcpd has two absorbing states , vacuum and states with one diffusing solitary particle .",
    "hence , we stop the simulations when the total number of particles @xmath64 is less then two . at the criticality ,",
    "the squared sizes scale as @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . fig .",
    "[ range ] shows the scaling plots of the squared sizes , @xmath68 .",
    "we obtain the best scaling plot with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "the errors of our estimates should be larger due to the error of @xmath72 . within the numerical errors at the criticality , our estimate of @xmath73 agree with the previous studies @xcite , especially @xmath74 @xcite . since @xmath8 , the total spreading distance @xmath75 should scale as @xmath76 , and @xmath3 plays the role of the correction to the scaling as in unidirectionally coupled systems .",
    "hence , we conclude @xmath77 which is the smallest value among the estimates of previous studies @xcite . for reference",
    ", we also measure @xmath43 using @xmath42-ensemble .",
    "the difference of @xmath42-ensemble from @xmath41-ensemble or @xmath39-ensemble is that @xmath42-ensemble includes configurations without pairs .",
    "since solitary particles spread diffusively , it is expected that @xmath4 averaged over @xmath42-ensemble scales differently from that of @xmath41-ensemble . from the scaling plot of @xmath78",
    ", we estimate @xmath79 for @xmath42-ensemble which is larger than that of @xmath41-ensemble ( not shown ) .",
    "the slow spreading of the whole domain in @xmath42-ensemble results from the diffusive motions of solitary particles in configuration without pairs .",
    "since @xmath4 scales as @xmath80 , the correction to the @xmath4 is @xmath55 which decays as @xmath81 with @xmath82 . to see how the correction decays slowly in time , we plot @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] . when @xmath84 , the correction is negligible .",
    "however , as shown in the inset , @xmath83 is still comparable to one even at @xmath60 .",
    "we obtain the best scaling plot of @xmath56 with @xmath85 .",
    "as @xmath83 decays with very small @xmath86 , it is practically impossible to reach the asymptotic scaling regime of @xmath87 . as a result",
    ", one should take the double domain structure into account for the more precise measurement of the dynamic exponent @xmath73 .",
    "( color online ) the scaling plot of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the main plot shows the scaling plot of @xmath94 ( red ) and @xmath95 ( black ) with @xmath96 .",
    "we add a constant @xmath97 to the scaling plot of @xmath93 for the better presentation .",
    "the inset shows the double logarithmic plots . ]",
    "in addition to the sizes , we also measure the number of pairs ( @xmath88 ) and of solitary particles ( @xmath98 ) averaged over all samples , and the survival probability of @xmath41-ensemble ( @xmath92 ) and @xmath42-ensemble ( @xmath93 ) . as solitary particles are linearly coupled to pairs , @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath88 . at criticality ,",
    "@xmath88 scales as @xmath99 . fig .",
    "[ eta ] shows the scaling plot @xmath89 .",
    "we obtain the best scaling plot with @xmath100 .",
    "the inset show the ratio of @xmath91 , which converges to one as expected . @xmath101 and @xmath102 decay in power - law as @xmath103 and @xmath104 at the criticality .",
    "[ p ] shows the scaling plots of @xmath105 and the double logarithmic plots of @xmath92 and @xmath93 . with @xmath106",
    ", we obtain the best scaling plots .",
    "the system escapes from the non - reactive sector in which only diffusing solitary particles are present via pair annihilations of solitary particles . as an naive argument for the equality of @xmath107 , the escaping probability from non - reactive sector within time @xmath108 may scale as @xmath109 which is the death probability of two diffusing particles undergoing the reaction @xmath110 within @xmath108 .",
    "hence , the contribution of non - reactive sector to @xmath93 is negligible due to the fast escaping probability , which leads to the same scaling behavior of @xmath93 as @xmath111 .    in summary , we investigate the domain structure of pcpd .",
    "we numerically confirm the existence of the double domain structure in pcpd .",
    "this double domain structure comes from the linear and quadratic bidirectional couplings .",
    "the structure intrinsically makes the serious correction to the scaling of the critical spreading of a domain .",
    "starting with a pair , a domain grows and spreads in vacuum via fission ( @xmath112 ) and spontaneous annihilation of pairs ( @xmath113 ) in pcpd .",
    "in addition to the binary reactions , each particle diffuses isotropically , which leads to the bidirectional coupling between solitary particles and pairs .",
    "the coupling from pairs to solitary particles is linear , while the opposite coupling is quadratic .",
    "the difference of the coupling ways results in the double domain structure of the whole domain , the coupled and the uncoupled region respectively . as a result , the size of the whole domain ( @xmath4 ) is given as the sum of the size of the coupled region ( @xmath2 ) and of the uncoupled region ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the basic length scales characterizing the scaling behavior of the spreading domain in pcpd .",
    "we numerically find that @xmath2 and @xmath3 scale as @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath114 at criticality .",
    "hence , @xmath4 should asymptotically scale as @xmath115 with @xmath116 and @xmath3 plays the role of the correction to the scaling",
    ". however , the direct measurement of @xmath4 leads to the underestimate of the asymptotic value of @xmath73 because the correction @xmath11 decays with very small exponent .",
    "since it is practically impossible to reach the asymptotic scaling region of @xmath117 , it is important to take the domain structure into account in simulations for more precise estimate of the dynamic exponent @xmath73 of pcpd .",
    "we classify particle configurations into four ensembles , which are finally reduced to two distinct ensembles , @xmath39-ensemble and @xmath42-ensemble respectively .",
    "@xmath42-ensemble includes configurations without pairs , while @xmath39-ensemble does not .",
    "the survival probabilities of two ensembles decay with the same exponent . however , the whole domain appears to spread more slowly in @xmath42-ensemble than in @xmath39-ensemble due to the diffusive motions of solitary particles in configurations without pairs .",
    "hence , in addition to the domain structure , the diffusive motions of solitary particles in @xmath42-ensemble raise another correction to the scaling of the total spreading distance @xmath4 which does not appear in @xmath39-ensemble .    as the linear - quadratic bidirectional coupling is the common feature of various pcpd studied so far",
    ", the double domain structure should appear in other pcpd variants . among pcpd variants ,",
    "we investigate the domain structure of the bosonic pcpd with soft - constraint of ref .",
    "@xcite which is known to exhibit the clear power - law decays at the criticality . for this model",
    ", we also confirm the existence of the double domain structure and the critical spreading behavior similar to that of pcpd studied in this paper .",
    "hence , the double domain structure is a common feature of pcpd variants .",
    "as shown in recent studies , as pcpd extremely slowly approaches to its asymptotic scaling region , it is very difficult to identify the critical behavior .",
    "the bidirectional coupling should be the main reason in itself .",
    "on the other hand , the double domain structure naturally appears due to the linear - quadratic bidirectional couplings , which enhance the long - time drift of dynamic exponent @xmath73 .",
    "one can overcomes the latter effect by considering the scaling behavior of sub - domains separately as in unidirectionally coupled systems .",
