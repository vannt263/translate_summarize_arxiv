    "in standard communication schemes , even if based on a digital encoding , the signals which are physically transmitted are intrinsically analogical in the sense that they can assume a continuous set of values .",

    "for example this is exactly the situation in which two optical signals are physically mixed via a beam  splitter of transmissivity @xmath11 .",

    "this is basically a lower bound on @xmath16 and the name _ entropy power _ is motivated by the fact that if @xmath17 is a product of @xmath0 equal isotropic gaussians one has @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the variance of each gaussian which is usually identified with the energy or _",

    "the need for a quantum version of the epi has arisen in the attempt of solving some fundamental problems in quantum communication theory . in particular",
    "the epi has come into play when it has been realized that a suitable generalization to the quantum setting , called _ entropy photon number inequality _ ( epni ) @xcite , would directly imply the solution of several optimization problems , including the determination of the classical capacity of gaussian channels and of the capacity region of the bosonic broadcast channel @xcite .",
    "up to now the epni is still unproved and , while the classical capacity has been recently computed @xcite by proving the bosonic minimum output entropy conjecture @xcite , the exact capacity region of the broadcast channel remains undetermined . in 2012 another quantum generalization of the epi",

    "splitter and to extend it also to the quantum amplifier .",
    "the qepi proved in this work , while directly giving tight bounds on several entropic quantities , also constitutes a potentially powerful tool which could be used in quantum information theory in the same spirit in which the classical epi was instrumental in deriving important classical results like : a bound to the capacity of non  gaussian channels @xcite , the convergence of the central limit theorem @xcite , the secrecy capacity of the gaussian wire ",
    "tap channel @xcite , the capacity region of broadcast channels @xcite , _ etc._. in this work we consider some of the direct consequences of the qepi and we hope to stimulate the research of other important implications in the field .",

    "we observe that , since the phase space of each mode is 2-dimensional , the total number of phase space variables is @xmath25 and this should be identified with the number @xmath0 appearing in the classical epi  ( [ cepi ] )",
    ". a similar collection of bosonic modes @xmath26 will play the role of system @xmath8 .",
    "the natural way of mixing the two signals is via a beam  splitter of transmissivity @xmath11  @xcite , which in the quantum optics formalism is represented by the unitary operation @xmath27 .",

    "we consider the case of independent inputs @xmath7 , @xmath8 , with a factorized density matrix @xmath32 .",
    "the _ quantum entropy power inequality _ ( qepi ) reads then @xmath33 where the classical shannon entropy has been replaced by the quantum von neumann entropy @xmath34 $ ] . unlike the classical case ,",
    "the qepi is _ not _ saturated by gaussian states with proportional covariance matrices , unless they have the same entropy .",
    "the qepi ( [ qepi ] ) was conjectured in ref .   where it was shown to hold only for the special case of @xmath21 .",
    "in this work we prove that inequality ( [ qepi ] ) is indeed valid for every @xmath11 .",
    "moreover we extend the qepi to the case in which the two input states are mixed via a _ quantum amplifier _ , _ i.e. _  when the unitary @xmath35 is replaced by the two - mode squeezing  @xcite operation @xmath36 with @xmath37 $ ] . in this case",
    "the modes @xmath38 are amplified and the modes @xmath39 are phase - conjugated . in the heisenberg picture",
    "we get @xmath40 and the amplifier version of the qepi becomes @xmath41    in the rest of the paper we are going to prove the validity of both inequalities  ( [ qepi ] ) and  ( [ qepik ] ) and to show some of their direct implications .",
    "almost all classical proofs @xcite of the epi are based on two properties of the fisher information : the _ fisher information inequality _ ( or _ stam inequality _",
    "@xcite ) and the _ de bruijn identity _ @xcite .",
    "here we follow the approach of in order to generalize such properties to quantum systems .",
    "given a smooth family of states @xmath42 the associated quantum fisher information can be defined in terms of the relative entropy : @xmath43 where @xmath44 $ ] . since the relative entropy is non - negative and vanishes for @xmath45 , we necessarily have @xmath46 and from the definition it is clear that @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , from the data processing inequality for the relative entropy its counterpart for the quantum fisher information follows : for every quantum channel @xmath48 , one has @xmath49 @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "the relevant cases are when @xmath50 is associated with translations along the phase space axes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where as usual @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "in this situation one can generalize important results form classical information theory .",
    "in particular if two input states are mixed via a beam  splitter or via a quantum amplifier as described in eq .",
    "( [ u ] ) , one can derive from the data processing inequality the quantum version of the _ stam inequality _ : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 the proof of for the beam ",
    "splitter in the special case @xmath21 was given in ref . .",
    "the key point of this paper is the generalization of this proof to any beam ",
    "splitter and amplifier , crucial for the derivation of the qepis and . in ,",
    "is derived from the inequality @xmath58 proven for any beam  splitter ( see methods for the proof in the amplifier case ) .",
    "our main idea is to choose @xmath59 and @xmath60 in order to get from the strongest possible inequality . for this purpose ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath61 as @xmath62 where we have used the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality .",
    "equality holds iff @xmath63 and with this choice becomes exactly the generalized stam inequality .",
    "another important and useful property is the quantum analogue of the _ de bruijn identity _ which relates the fisher information to the the entropy flow under additive gaussian noise , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66+[p_j,[p_j,\\rho]]\\right)\\;.\\ ] ] the proof , repeated in the methods , simply follows from the definition of the ensembles @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the argument is similar to the one used in the derivation of the classical epi .",
    "this technique , which is based on the addition of white gaussian noise in the system , was extended to the quantum domain in ref .   in order to prove the qepi for the special case of @xmath21 .",
    "here we use the properties ( [ fii ] ) and ( [ deb ] ) of the quantum fisher information and we show that the qepi is valid for all @xmath10 $ ] ( beam  splitter ) and for all @xmath69 ( amplifier ) .    the key idea borrowed from the classical proof is to notice that , for highly entropic thermal states , inequalities and are almost saturated .",
    "then if we evolve the inputs adding classical gaussian noise , and will asymptotically hold in the infinite time limit , and we just need to prove that the added noise has not improved the inequalities .",
    "this can be achieved in the quantum setting by the application of the gaussian additive noise channel @xmath70 where the liouvillian operator @xmath71 is the one defined in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) .",
    "we need an asymptotic estimate for the entropy of @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "intuitively , one can guess that for large times the memory of the input state is washed out and that the leading contribution to the entropy comes from the gaussian noise alone .",
    "indeed it can be shown ( see methods ) that , for every input state @xmath74 , @xmath75 we then consider as input states the evolved @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where we still have the freedom to let @xmath7 and @xmath8 evolve with different speeds by suitably choosing the dependence of their times @xmath78 and @xmath79 on a common time @xmath80 , with the conditions : @xmath81 from the composition laws of gaussian channels , it follows that evolving @xmath82 and @xmath83 by times @xmath84 and @xmath85 before the application of the beam ",
    "splitter ( or of the amplifier ) produces at the output the state @xmath86 evolved by a time @xmath87 the corresponding time dependent version of the qepis ( [ qepi ] ) and ( [ qepik ] ) can be rearranged in the following form :    @xmath88/n}+\\lambda_be^{s\\left[\\rho_b(t_b)\\right]//n}}{e^{s\\left[\\rho_c(t_c)\\right]/n}}\\;.\\ ] ]    now if we plug in the asymptotic behavior , we see that the inequality is saturated for @xmath89 .",
    "the qepi that we need to prove is simply for @xmath90 and this can be achieved if we are able to show that the rhs of ( [ qepit ] ) is monotonically increasing in time , _",

    "( [ tbs ] ) we have @xmath97 and so the condition ( [ ineq2 ] ) reduces to    @xmath98    at this point our quantum version of the _ stam inequality _ ( [ fii ] ) comes into play providing a useful upper bound to @xmath99 , @xmath100 by plugging it into ( [ ineq3 ] ) and rearranging the terms we get @xmath101 which is trivially satisfied because of the non - negativity of the fisher information .",
    "this concludes the proof of both inequalities ( [ qepi ] ) and ( [ qepik ] ) and we can now focus on some of their direct implications .",
    "one of the features of the qepi is that it is a significantly strong bound .",
    "for example from the concavity of the logarithm we directly get from ( [ qepi ] ) and ( [ qepik ] ) the respective linear relations , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath102 in the classical setting , the analogue of the first of these expressions is known to be formally equivalent to eq .",

    "for the quantum case however , such correspondence is no longer valid and eqs .",
    "( [ blin ] )  and ( [ amplin ] ) appear to be weaker than  ( [ qepi ] ) and ( [ qepik ] ) , respectively .",

    "the epni states that fixing the input entropies @xmath109 , @xmath110 , the output entropy @xmath111 is minimum when the inputs are thermal .",
    "since the qepi is _ not _ saturated by thermal states ( unless they have the same entropy ) , it is weaker than ( and it is actually implied by ) the epni , so our proof of qepi does not imply the epni , which still remains an open conjecture . however , as we are going to show , the validity of the qepi imposes a very tight bound ( of the order of @xmath112 ) on the maximum allowed violation of the epni .",
