    "oh 1612mhz masers have been found in different kinds of objects , such as oh miras , oh / ir stars , proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , red supergiants ( rsgs ) , hii regions ( hiis ) , molecular clouds , and so on ( elitzur,@xcite ) .",
    "the oh masers appearing in hiis or molecular clouds , are called _ interstellar oh masers _ while those appearing in all other types of sources are called _ stellar oh masers _ , depending on whether the masing molecules originate from interstellar space ( by accretion ) or from the central star ( by stellar wind ) .",
    "because the oh masers in post - agb sources , such as post - agb stars , ppne and pne , show peculiar properties , as we will see below in the discussions of this paper , i would like to separate them from the stellar oh maser group to form a third group : _ post - agb oh masers_. up till now , three different pumping mechanisms have been proposed for the oh 1612mhz masers arising in different astronomical environments : radiative pumping , collisional pumping and chemical pumping . according to the recent developments in the maser pumping theory ,",
    "more physical effects such as local and non - local line overlap ( e.g. , pavlakis and kylafis@xcite , @xcite ) were recognized to be playing important roles in certain cases .",
    "but little effort has been made to directly compare in observations the different pumping mechanisms of the oh 1612mhz masers that occur in different kind of objects .    among the different kinds of objects showing oh 1612mhz maser , late type stars such as oh miras , oh / ir stars and rsgs",
    "are believed to have their oh masers radiatively pumped .",
    "most of these objects have a huge spherical , although perhaps clumpy , circumstellar dust - gas envelope .",
    "the oh 1612mhz maser is formed in the outer part of the huge envelope and is pumped mainly by absorbing the 34.6 and 53.3@xmath1 m photons .",
    "the physical environments in the three kinds of objects are a little different .",
    "for example , oh miras often have optically thin dust envelope while oh / ir stars are usually embedded in very optically thick dust shell ; rsgs have much higher luminosity and their dusty envelopes are harsher than that of oh miras and oh / ir stars .",
    "ppne and pne are objects immediately following the agb evolutionary stage .",
    "the oh 1612mhz maser inherited from their precursors can still survive for about 1000 years ( sun and kwok@xcite ) .",
    "but due to the evident changes of the envelope , the survived oh 1612mhz masers in ppne or pne are often found not in a spherical shell but in a circumstellar disk or bipolar outflow ( e.g. , zijlstra et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the pump mechanism of these remanent oh masers is thought to be mainly radiative one too .",
    "however , for ppne or pne that show bipolar outflows , the oh masers can also appear in the interaction region between the outflow and the ambient interstellar material ( likkel and morris@xcite ) and , in this case , the oh masers may be pumped by collision .",
    "oh 1612mhz masers have been found in some hiis in star formation regions ( sfrs ) .",
    "they are often found accompanying with the oh main line masers ( caswell@xcite , szymczak and gerard@xcite ) .",
    "the physical environment in sfrs is much more complicated than that in the circumstellar envelope of late type stars .",
    "the expanding ionized hydrogen sphere creates a geometrically thin but dense layer compressed by shock waves in the inner edge of the huge outer in - falling dust - gas envelope .",
    "the oh masers were believed to arise just in the shock compressed layer ( cochran and ostriker@xcite ) . additionally , high velocity bipolar outflow have been found in many sfrs ( e.g. , campbell@xcite , shepherd@xcite ) , but it is not clear whether the oh 1612mhz masers can be stimulated in the interaction region between the outflow and the ambient interstellar material .",
    "the difference in physical environments results in different oh maser - pumping mechanisms at work .",
    "however , it is not easy to directly discriminate the different maser pumping mechanisms from observational aspects . in our previous two papers ( he et al.@xcite and he & chen @xcite , hereafter paper i and paper ii , respectively )",
    ", we systematically analyzed the 34.6 and 53.3@xmath1 m pumping lines in all infrared space observatory ( iso ) short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) and long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) spectra of known oh / ir sources ( infrared sources showing oh 1612mhz maser ) and found that the ( pseudo ) radiative pumprates of oh masers arising in different environments are quite different .",
    "this paper continues to discuss another important problem : how the different kinds of 1612mhz maser sources obey or violate the principle that the input of pumping photons should be proportional to the maser output for a radiatively pumped maser ?",
    "although similar job had been done in the past decades by other authors using ir photometrical data ( e.g. , le bertre et al.@xcite , dickinson@xcite , silva et al.@xcite ) , the available ir spectral data from iso enable one to perform a more powerful analysis of the oh 1612mhz maser pump rate by directly comparing the emission of maser photons to the absorption of ir photons . the potential of iso spectra is dug out to the utmost to constrain the value or a reasonable range of the ( pseudo ) radiative maser pumprate for all oh / ir sample sources . in section[data ] , the data sets are organized and described .",
    "some sources with ambiguous source types are re - identified based on literature information in section[identification ] .",
    "the discussion of the ( pseudo ) radiative pumprates of different types of oh maser is given in section[pumprate ] .",
    "some related topics are discussed in section[discussion ] .",
    "section[summary ] briefly summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "although not all oh 1612mhz masers considered here are radiatively pumped , a _ pseudo radiative pumprate _ can be defined by temporarily assuming they are all radiatively pumped .",
    "this pseudo pumprate is defined as the integrated 1612mhz oh maser photon flux divided by the sum of the integrated infrared absorption line photon fluxes at both wavelength : 34.6 and 53.3@xmath1 m . as we demonstrated in paper i and ii , this ( pseudo ) pumprate has the advantage to effectively distinguish oh masers arising in different physical environments and/or pumped by different mechanisms .",
    "according to paper i and ii , six oh / ir sources have both the 34.6 and 53.3@xmath1 m pumping lines detected by iso ; their ( pseudo ) maser pumprates that is defined as integrated line photon flux ratio @xmath2 had already been derived therein . here",
    "the pumprates of the six sources are reproduced in table[sample1 ] and these sources compose the ` sample 1 ' of this paper . also given in the table are the source type mainly given by simbad database ( http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/sim-fid.pl ) and the iras color c@xmath0=log(_f_@xmath3/_f_@xmath4 ) , where in the case that no reliable iras fluxes are available for defining the color indices iso spectra are used to derive equivalent iras fluxes using the iras photometrical filter templates in isap .",

    "no reliable iras fluxes are available to make iras color index c@xmath0 , iso spectra are used to derive equivalent iras fluxes .",
    "there are 9 sources in paper i and ii showing the 53.3@xmath1 m absorption line in the iso lws spectra but with their 34.6@xmath1 m lines not observed or not detected .",
    "they compose the ` sample 2 ' in this paper . among them , seven ones have 34.6@xmath1 m iso sws spectra but the absorption line is too weak to be detected . in this case , 3 times of the standard deviation ( @xmath7 noise ) of the continuum can be used to estimate an upper limit of the integrated line flux for these missing absorption lines when the line width ( fwhm ) has been estimated .",
    "( see how to estimate the line width in spectra of different resolutions in appendix . )",
    "if all these missing 34.6@xmath1 m lines are assumed to be in absorption , no matter how weak they are , the lower limit of the integrated line fluxes should be 0 w/@xmath8 .",
    "the other two sources in sample 2 are not observed by iso sws at 34.6@xmath1 m . in this case , the integrated photon flux of the 53.3@xmath1 m line alone can be considered as a lower limit of the total integrated photon flux of both infrared pumping lines , because the missing 34.6@xmath1 m line can be assumed to be in absorption .",
    "these upper and lower limits of the integrated infrared absorption line fluxes can then be transformed respectively into lower and upper limits of the ( pseudo ) maser pumprate .",
    "the derived pumprates are listed in table[sample2 ] in which column ( 1 ) is iras name of the sources ; column ( 2 ) is the source type ; column ( 3 ) is iras color indices c@xmath0 , where in the case that no reliable iras fluxes are available for defining the color indices iso spectra are used to derive equivalent iras fluxes ( see more remarks in the last paragraph of this section ) ; column ( 4 ) is the integrated 53.3@xmath1 m line flux ( from paper ii ) ; column ( 5 ) to ( 7 ) are the iso sws spectrum name , standard deviation of 34.6@xmath1 m continuum and the estimated lower and upper limits of the integrated 34.6@xmath1 m line flux respectively ( when more than one iso sws spectra are available for a source , the one with the lowest @xmath9 noise among the brightest ones are used ) ; column ( 8) is the integrated flux of the oh 1612mhz maser from literature ; column ( 9 ) is the estimated upper and/or lower limit of the pumprate while column ( 10 ) gives the reference information and some notes for the oh maser flux data .",
    "the source types in column ( 2 ) are mainly from simbad database while that of the two sources : and are re - identified by this paper ( see the details in the next section ) .",
    "note that , for the red supergiant , the pumprate is estimated to be in a pair of separated regions : ` @xmath10 ' and ` @xmath11 ' .",
    "the reason for this strange situation is that the filling emission feature in the 53.3@xmath1 m line profile of this source is so strong that the total flux integrated over the whole line profile becomes net emission !",
    "the same curious thing also happens for another red supergiant , but the difference is that the 34.6@xmath1 m line of this latter source is detected to be very strong absorption , which effectively compensates the net emission in 53.3@xmath1 m line when calculating maser pumprate .",
    "how the strong filling emission in the 53.3@xmath1 m oh absorption line arises is an interesting question to answer , but it is not the task of this paper . eventually , the positive region ` @xmath12 ' is chosen for in further analysis because negative pumprate is impossible for a radiatively pumped oh maser .",

    "however , lws spectra are found to be several times brighter than sws spectra in the overlap region for the other two sources : and .",
    "the large discrepancies are mainly due to three facts : both sources lie in the galactic center , the pointing directions of sws and lws observations are not strictly the same , and the apertures of the sws and lws spectrometers are different .",

    "the galactic center is crowed with all kinds of infrared sources , hence the differences in aperture size and pointing mean that the pair of sws and lws spectra do not strictly belong to the same source .",

    "the fact that jiang et al.(@xcite ) tried but failed to identified the optical counterparts of the star up to 20 mag in v band and 19 mag in i bands also supports that it is a star with very thick circumstellar envelope : oh / ir star .",
    "one of the main tasks of this paper is to investigate whether the late type stars whose oh 1612mhz masers are thought to be radiatively pumped show proportional relationship between the ir absorption and the maser emission ( i.e. , show fixed pumprate ) and whether the hiis whose oh 1612mhz maser can be pumped by variety of mechanisms violate this relationship ( i.e. , show varying pumprates ) .",
    "the pumprates of sample 1 sources and the pumprate ranges of sample 2 sources are shown in fig.[figsample12 ] .",
    "the distribution of the six sample 1 sources can be grouped obviously into 3 regions : the three rsgs lie in the upper left region , the two galactic center ( gc ) sources lie in the lower left region while the only megamaser lies high up in the middle top of the figure .",
    "the large differences in the ( pseudo ) radiative pumprates of different types of maser sources had already been addressed in paper i and ii .",
    "taking account the sample 2 sources , one can see in fig.[figsample12 ] that the separation of stellar oh masers ( rsgs , mira ) from interstellar oh masers ( hiis , cluster , gc sources ) still holds while two post - agb sources ( pagb , ppn ) lie between the two regions . one should note that the three rsgs and the mira crowd tightly around the pumprate of about 0.06 while the interstellar oh masers distribute in a large area with their ( pseudo ) oh maser pumprates varying for almost two orders of magnitude .     for sample 1 and 2 sources .",
    "source types are marked beside each source .",
    "double crosses represent the pumprate ranges determined for some sample 2 sources while arrows mean that the pumprate value is merely an upper or lower limit .",
    "the question mark cautions the readers that only the positive lower limit of the maser pumprate for this source is shown in the figure while another negative upper limit ( see table[sample2 ] ) is dropped due to the unreality of the negative pumprate for a radiatively pumped oh maser.,width=340 ]    this difference in variation range of the oh maser pumprates sheds light on the maser pumping mechanisms of the sources .",
    "the nearly fixed pumprates of stellar oh 1612mhz masers supports the argument that they are really mainly radiatively pumped , because the absorption of ir photons is proportional to the emission of maser photons .",
    "but the low value and large variation of maser pumprates of interstellar masers may be due to several possible reasons .",
    "firstly , the most significant factor is the difference in physical environments . compared with late type stars , sfrs",
    "usually have more extended , thicker and colder circumstellar envelope .",
    "the oh molecules can be produced not only in the inner edge of the dusty envelope by either high temperature stellar radiation or by shock waves , but also in the outer edge of the envelope by interstellar uv radiation ( similar to that occurs around late type star ) .",
    "maybe not all the oh molecular cloudlets in sfrs can successfully stimulate maser action .",
    "for example ,",
    "szymczak & g@xmath54rard(@xcite ) found 36 hii regions to show blue shifted oh main line absorption , and argued that these absorptions may be caused by the oh molecules formed in front of the central continuum sources .",
    "lets call such non - maser oh cloudlets _",
    "quiet oh cloudlets_. therefore , if a significant number of oh cloudlets in hiis are quiet , the pseudo pump rate will become small and change with changing number of quiet oh cloudlets .",
    "secondly , the difference in maser pumping mechanisms can also contribute to the large variation of the ( pseudo ) maser pumprates .",
    "the oh maser pumping mechanism in hiis was incipiently considered collision because the masing oh molecules were believed to be produced in the shock compressed geometrically thin layer between the inner ionized hydrogen sphere and the outer dusty envelope ( elitzur@xcite )",
    ". however , later works ( e.g. , pavlakis & kylafis@xcite , @xcite ) showed that the radiative oh maser pumping involving local and non - local line overlap effects are also possible for hiis , because there usually exists a remarkable velocity field in the oh masing region therein .",
    "further more , thissen et al.(@xcite ) and liu et al.(@xcite ) demonstrated by their dynamical calculations that the chemical pumping of oh masers is also possible in hiis .",
    "it is evident that the quite different oh maser pumping mechanisms will involve quite different energy level transition schemes among the oh rotational levels , which may result in quite different ( pseudo ) maser pumprates , so as to explain the scattered distribution of interstellar oh masers in fig.[figsample12 ] , [ figsample123 ] and [ figlow ] .",
    "thirdly , many interstellar oh masers are found to be strong mainline oh masers ( e.g. , caswell & haynes@xcite ) . because the 1665 and 1667mhz mainline maser transitions share the upper and lower energy levels with the 1612mhz transition respectively",
    ", the strong mainline masers may weaken the 1612mhz maser through the so - called competitive gain ( field@xcite ) , and hence result in very small 1612mhz pump rate .",
    "lastly , the anisotropy of the maser region may also play a role in the small and varying pump rates .",
    "most interstellar oh masers are found to show irregular morphology , and sometimes bipolar morphology ( e.g. , hutawarakorn et al.@xcite ) .",
    "oh maser is usually strongly beamed .",
    "if the strongest beam is not pointing to us , the observed maser flux can significantly decrease , and then results in very small pump rates and the pump rates will highly vary with varying maser beam pointing .    one may have noted that a post agb star and a ppn in fig.[figsample12 ] lie between the two groups of masers : stellar oh masers and interstellar oh masers .",
    "this hints that the pumprates of these post agb objects may form a bridge connecting the two typical kinds of oh masers due to some unknown reasons .",
    "this point will be confirmed below when the sample 3 sources are included in fig.[figsample123 ] and [ figlow ] .    the sample 3 sources only have lower limit estimation of the ( pseudo ) oh maser pumprate .",
    "these lower limits are compared with the more accurate pumprates or pumprate ranges of the sources from sample 1 and 2 in fig.[figsample123 ] .",
    "the distribution areas of interstellar oh masers , including those arising in hiis , sfrs , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , an herbig - haro object ( hh ) , a stellar cluster near gc , an unknown infrared source near gc and the two gc sources , are shown with hatched squares in fig.[figsample123 ] .",
    "one can see from the figure that , on the one hand , the interstellar oh masers are well separated from the stellar oh masers and show very small ( pseudo ) maser pumprates , on the other hand , these lower limits seem also to follow the decreasing trend from stellar oh masers in the upper left region to the interstellar oh masers in the lower right region",
    ". however , a few sources in the lower left corner have the typical iras c@xmath0 color of stellar oh maser but show abnormally small pumprate lower limits .     for all sample 1 , 2 and 3 sources .",
    "the arrows mean that the pumprates for all sample 3 sources are lower limits only .",
    "the hatched square areas represent the distribution regions of interstellar oh maser sources while the other sources , with the exception of the two ones marked by their type or name : orv * and , all belong to stellar oh masers.,width=340 ]    the behavior of the maser pumprate lower limit distribution in fig.[figsample123 ] is not only related to the nature of the different types of oh masers but also largely affected by the discrepancy between the maser pumprate lower limits and the true maser pumprates",
    ". however , this unknown discrepancy can be partly reflected by the signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio of the infrared spectra .",
    "the s / n ratio is defined for the 34.6 and 53.3@xmath1 m continuum fluxes respectively using the @xmath9 noise listed in table[sample3 ] , and then a mean s / n ratio is defined as the mathematical average of the two .",
    "the s / n ratios of sample 3 sources turn out to be varying quite a lot ( ranging from 4.4 to 252.5 ) .",
    "one can find from table[sample3 ] that the @xmath9 noise at the two wavelengths do not vary too much .",
    "the large variation of the s / n ratios mainly originates from the variation of the ir brightness of the sources .",
    "therefore , the sources with lower s / n ratios are mainly those with lower ir brightness and hence with smaller oh absorption depths ( if all sources are assumed to have approximately the same _ relative _ oh absorption depth ) . in such sense , the maser pumprate lower limits derived from spectra with higher s / n ratio are generally closer to the true maser pumprates while those derived from spectra with very poor s / n ratio is generally far smaller than the true maser pumprates .    to visualize the effect of the s / n ratios , fig.[figsample123 ] is re - drawn in fig.[figlow ] in which the sample 3 sources are shown in black balls with the ball size proportional to the s / n ratio while the sample 1 and 2 sources are all shown in open circles .",
    "one can easily see from this figure that the positions of the largest balls , i.e. , those sample 3 sources with the maser pumprate lower limits most close to the true maser pumprates , are well coincident with the distribution regions of stellar and interstellar oh masers from sample 1 and 2 , which confirms once again the difference in oh maser pumprates between the two typical kinds of oh masers . those stellar - oh - maser mimics with unexpected too small maser pumprate lower limits ( i.e. , sources located in the dotted line circle in fig.[figlow ] ) are all sources with poor s / n ratios ( with small ball sizes in the figure ) . that is to say , the too small maser pumprate lower limits of these sources should be blamed to the too weak apparent ir brightness and hence the too poor quality of the spectral data .     but with different marks : all sources of sample 1 and 2 are shown in open circles while all sample 3 sources are shown in black balls with the ball size proportional to the mean s / n ratio of the infrared spectra .",
    "the source types of some sample 3 sources that have high s / n ratio ( large size balls ) are marked in the figure .",
    "those marked by gray dotted - line arrows are post agb stars or ppne / pne which mainly distribute in the transitional region between the stellar oh masers in the upper left region and the interstellar oh masers in the lower right region.,width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "3 , all post - agb stars and pne / ppne are marked by gray dotted - line arrow .",
    "as one can see , these post agb sources mainly occupy the region between the two regions of stellar and interstellar oh masers .",
    "this fact confirms the earlier guess that the post agb sources may have intermediate pumprates to bridge the two typical kinds of oh masers .",
    "this transitional behavior of maser pumprate may be due to the physical changes happened in post agb stars , e.g. , the change of the envelope morphology , the detachment of the inner edge of the circumstellar envelope , which results in the sharp decrease of the amount of hot dust grains that are responsible to emit most of the infrared maser - pumping photons , and so on",
    ". however , this bridging phenomenon is mainly supported by the lower limit estimations of the maser pumprates of sample 3 sources , it is necessary to obtain more accurate oh maser pumprates for these sources in the future to further confirm this finding .",
    "oh 1612mhz maser pump rates of stellar masers are found to be nearly constantly around 0.06 from this paper .",
    "the model of elitzur et al.(@xcite ) predicted that five to ten 34.6@xmath1 m photons are needed to produce a maser photon ( corresponding to a pump rate of @xmath55 ) . realizing that the pump rates derived in this paper have taken account the contribution of 53.3@xmath1 m line",
    ", the derived pump rates basically agree with the theoretical prediction .",
    "if all energy level transition processes , such as collision , local and non - local line overlap , are taken account in the theoretical model and the maser pump rate can be defined in the same way as in this paper , it is reasonable to expect a better agreement between the theoretical and observed oh maser pump rates for stellar masers .",
    "previous statistical works usually defined the 1612mhz maser pump rate using the 35@xmath1 m photometrical data and the peak maser flux intensity .",
    "this definition is only a loose lower limit of the true pump rates , hence the derived ` pump rates ' strongly varied from star to star .",
    "for example , both silva et al.(@xcite ) and chen et al.(@xcite ) used the definition @xmath56 .",
    "the former derived pump rates ranging from @xmath57 for a sample of oh / ir stars with very cool envelope , while the latter found that the pump rates were increasing with iras color log(@xmath58 ) and distributed in a broad range from 0.001 to 1 for a sample of oh / ir stars with type e or type a iras / lrs spectrum .",
    "werner et al.(@xcite ) used the same definition and found a pump rate range @xmath59 for five oh / ir stars with very thick envelope .",
    "the large variations among these ` pump rates ' are mainly due to the fact that the ` pump rate ' is only a coarse lower limit . one may note that the pump rates found by these authors are usually far larger than the value 0.06 found in this paper . this is because the pump rate is defined differently in this paper using integrated photon fluxes .",
    "some authors also tried to defined pump rate with integrated line fluxes in an approximate way : @xmath60 .",
    "but the pump rate defined in this way also suffers large uncertainty and varies strongly .",
    "for example , le bertre et al.(@xcite ) derived such pump rates of 0.05 for three typeii",
    "oh / ir stars while david et al.(@xcite ) found in similar way that the maser pump rates range from 0.0005 to 0.25 ( note that these pump rates are defined by energy fluxes instead of photon fluxes ) . in this paper , the properly defined 1612mhz maser pump rates shown for the four stellar oh masers in fig.[figsample12 ] distribute in a narrow range ( @xmath61 ) , which forcefully confirms the radiative pumping nature of these stellar oh 1612mhz masers",
    "however , the lower limits of the pump rates of stellar oh masers ( sources with small color indices in fig.[figsample123 ] and [ figlow ] ) still distribute in a broad range ( @xmath62 ) , which demonstrates that the lower limit of oh 1612mhz maser pump rate estimated using spectral noise level is already not reliable , not to mention those defined by photometrical data .",
    "the fact that interstellar oh masers show smaller 1612mhz maser pump rates had been addressed by other authors using the pump rate defined by ir photometrical data .",
    "le bertre et al.(@xcite ) found that the maser pump rate defined as @xmath60 is larger than 0.01 for three type ii oh / ir stars but smaller than 0.01 for a type i source .",
    "dickinson(@xcite ) used the definition @xmath56 and found that the pump rates range from about 0.07 to 0.2 for type ii oh / ir stars but are about 0.02 for type i sources .",
    "however , these contrast between type i and type ii oh / ir sources are not as prominent as that found in this paper . from fig.[figsample12 ] , [ figsample123 ] and [ figlow ] , one can see that the properly defined 1612mhz maser pump rates vary across 5 orders of magnitude from stellar oh masers ( type ii oh / ir sources ) to interstellar oh masers ( type i oh / ir sources ) . as discussed in previous section ,",
    "one of the possible explanations for the very low maser pump rates of interstellar oh masers is the so - called competitive gain between mainline and 1612mhz oh masers . here",
    "i would like to supply more observational proofs upon this point by comparing the peak strengths of the two competing kinds of masers .",
    "the interstellar oh masers are usually found to show stronger mainline oh masers than 1612mhz maser .",
    "the 1665 and 1667mhz mainline maser transitions share upper and lower energy levels with 1612mhz transition respectively . therefore , in the case that mainline oh masers are as strong as or even stronger than the 1612mhz maser",
    ", the latter should has been significantly weakened by the former through competitive gain ( field@xcite ) , which eventually results in very small 1612mhz pump rate . in order to verify that the interstellar oh masers in sample 1 , 2 and 3 are really strong mainline masers , the peak intensities of strongest peak of mainline masers and low velocity peak of 1612mhz masers are collected for most sample sources from literature ( see in table[mainline ] in which the literature for the 1612mhz peak flux data are the same as those from which the integrated maser fluxes are extracted ) .",
    "the mainline to 1612mhz peak flux ratios are visualized in fig.[figmainline ] in which the sources in different evolutionary status are differentiated by different symbols .",
    "as one can see , most stellar oh masers ( filled circles and squares ) have 1612mhz maser stronger than mainline masers while it is reversed for interstellar masers ( pluses and crosses ) .",
    "this confirms that the interstellar oh masers in the sample are really strong mainline emitters .",
    "therefore , the competitive gain between mainline and 1612mhz masers should be a rather reasonable explanation for the very small 1612mhz pump rates of interstellar oh masers , although it is still not clear how the pumping process of the mainline masers affects the 34.6 and 53.3@xmath1 m absorption lines .",
    "a special sources should be noted .",
    "although it is classified as stellar oh maser , it show much stronger mainline oh maser in fig.[figmainline ] .",
    "it is a srb variable .",
    "the circumstellar envelope of srb is believed to be even optically thinner than that of mira variables , and hence it usually emits stronger mainline masers .    the last point to note is the role of filling emission that is found in 53.3@xmath1 m absorption line profiles of both stellar and interstellar oh masers ( he & chen@xcite ) .",
    "the 1612mhz maser pump rates calculated in the paper have taken account the contribution of the filling emission feature .",
    "for two stellar masers , and , the filling emission is so strong that the 53.3@xmath1 m line becomes net emission . for the latter source ,",
    "the very strong absorption at 34.6@xmath1 m balanced the emission at 53.3@xmath1 m and a 1612mhz maser pump rate typical of stellar oh maser is found ( 0.079 ) .",
    "however , for the former source , the estimated upper limit of the pump rate becomes negative due to the non - detection of the 34.6@xmath1 m absorption ( the @xmath7 noise of the 34.6@xmath1 m continuum spectral flux is low ) .",
    "it seems that some unknown processes are at work not only in the pumping of the observed 1612mhz maser but also in producing the strong filling emission in 53.3@xmath1 m oh line .",
    "it is worthy of further maser pumping modeling work .     and @xmath63 are the ratio of the maser peak fluxes .",
    "the dotted line marks the border above which mainline maser is stronger than 1612mhz maser .",

    "the correlation between ( pseudo ) maser pumprate or pumprate distribution and maser source types reveals three facts : ( 1 ) oh 1612mhz masers in late type stars show nearly fixed radiative pumprate , which agrees to the general thought that they are mainly radiatively pumped and hence the ir pumping - line flux should be proportional to the maser flux ; ( 2 ) oh 1612mhz masers occurring in interstellar material show very small and largely varying ( pseudo ) radiative pumprates , which should be explained by four alternative scenarios or their combinations : absorption by quiet oh cloudlets , different oh maser pump mechanism , competitive gain between mainline and 1612mhz masers , anisotropy of the maser emission ; ( 3 ) it is very likely that post - agb stars , oh - ppne and oh - pne have their oh maser pumprates between that of typical stellar and interstellar oh masers .    generally , the width of a line feature depends on many factors , such as natural width of energy levels , gas temperature , turbulence distribution , global expansion or contraction velocity distribution , instrumental resolution and all kinds of noise .",

    "therefore , the 34.6@xmath1 m quadruple can be considered as a doublet with two narrow components . for 53.3@xmath1 m ,",

    "the four sub - lines can be divided into two groups with the separation of the two sub - lines within each group ( not larger than 0.0004@xmath1 m ) much smaller than the distance between the two groups ( about 0.09@xmath1 m ) .",
    "therefore it can also be considered as a doublet with narrow components .",
    "the resolution of the iso sws / lws is low .",
