    "moreover , we have the zeeman energy @xmath9 , the effective lande factor @xmath10 , the bohr magneton @xmath11 , and the hybridization matrix element @xmath12 , which reflects the hybridization between the upper and lower surfaces of the ti .",

    "the main point to note about the energy spectrum , which will be crucial to the following discussion , is : the splitting of the energy levels depends on both the zeeman interaction and the hybridization between the upper and lower surfaces . if either of these two mechanisms is absent",
    ", no splitting will occur .",
    "further , the energy spectrum is electron - hole symmetric in the absence of the zeeman interaction , with a hybridization gap .",
    "we note that angular resolved photoelectron spectroscopy finds no electron - hole symmetry even in the absence of both zeeman interaction and hybridization , reflecting a quadratic term in the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , in our surface hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 2 ) no quadratic term is present as it can be neglected when the system is doped such that the dirac point comes close to the charge neutrality point , which is the focus of our work . in the presence of both zeeman interaction and hybridization",
    ", the @xmath18 ll explicitly shows a quantum phase transition",
    ". this will be important in the discussion of the dos and the capacitance results .",
    "we consider a gated ti device in which the capacitor is formed between the gate and the ti thin film .",
    "the magnetocapacitance of the device represents the charge response in the channel as the channel potential is varied . in conventional devices , the magnetocapacitance @xmath19 is large and can be ignored . on the contrary , in low dimensional devices , such as 2d electron gases , graphene , and future ti devices ,",
    "it is the dominant capacitive contribution and therefore an important quantity in the design of nanoscale devices .",

    "we choose a constant level width of @xmath41 mev .",
    "we are interested in changes of the character at @xmath42 on variation of the zeeman interaction and hybridization relative to each other .",
    "it must be noted that the @xmath18 ll here plays the most important role .",
    "figure 1 shows that @xmath19 is zero at @xmath42 .",
    "this occurs because the @xmath18 ll splits only when the hybridization does not vanish .",

    "the states are electron - hole symmetric at this stage .",
    "@xmath19 can be tuned from a minimum to a maximum when the zeeman energy is increased by changing the external magnetic field . for @xmath44",
    "both @xmath18 sublevels are located in the hole region , which breaks the electron - hole symmetry , see fig .  2 , and represents the trivial to non - trivial topological insulator phase transition .",
    "to observe the splitting , the broadening of the lls must be less than the hybridization energy .",
    "we note that not only the @xmath18 ll but all lls are split into two sublevels .    in fig .",

    "we observe a beating pattern and a splitting of the sdh oscillations , respectively .",
    "both occurs due to interference of the sdh oscillations at two different frequencies and therefore is a consequence of the splitting of the lls for finite zeeman interaction and hybridization .",
    "the beating pattern vanishes once the zeeman interaction dominates the hybridization . for the chosen parameters",
    "this occurs at a magnetic field of about 1.5 t. above this value we find a well resolved splitting of the sdh oscillations in fig .",
    "3 . a similar beating pattern and splitting of sdh oscillations in the longitudinal resistivity",
    "is seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it occurs because of splitting of the lls as a result of a broken inversion symmetry due to substrate effects .",
    "the sample investigated in this reference is thick and hybridization effects are ruled out .    in order to understand the origin of the beating pattern and splitting of the sdh oscillations quantatively , we employ the poisson summation formula @xmath51dn \\label{12}%\\ ] ] to arrive at the following expression for the dos at zero temperature which incorporates the contributions of the @xmath52 lls : @xmath53   \\cos\\left [   \\frac{2\\pi k}{\\hslash^{2}\\omega^{2}}(\\varepsilon_{f}^{2}-(\\delta_{z}+\\tau_{z}\\delta _ { h})^{2})\\right ]   \\right\\ }   \\label{13}%\\ ] ] here , @xmath54 is the zero magnetic field dos . for @xmath55 ,",
    "it is sufficient to retain only the first order term ( @xmath56 ) , since the higher order terms are highly damped . from eq .",
    "( 12 ) we can confirm that the beating pattern is due to the interference of waves with two different frequencies .",

    "\\label{15}%\\ ] ] this represents a wave of higher frequency whose amplitude oscillates at a lower frequency , giving rise to the beating pattern , because @xmath59 the amplitude of the sdh oscillations is modulated by @xmath60 $ ] and nodes occur at @xmath61 , where the modulating cosine vanishes .",
    "we also note that the amplitude modulation given by the term @xmath62 $ ] occurs when both zeeman interaction and hybridization are present in the system .",
    "moreover , the threshold magnetic field where beating is seen depends on the strenghts of the zeeman interaction and hybridization . for magnetic fields down to about 1.5 t",
    "the beating persists . above this value",
    "it is quenched to show splitting of the sdh oscillations .",
    "as mentioned before this finding is in agreement with the experimental work in ref .",
    "topological systems are typically doped away from the charge neutrality point . in addition",
    ", the bulk usually dominates the surface contributions . however , thin films of topological insulators make it possible to access the surface contributions only @xcite , typically when the thickness is below 5 nm . in this context , we compare our results with the experimental observations for the quantum magnetocapacitance @xcite .",
    "the latter authors study films that are thick enough that hybridization between the top and bottom surfaces can be ignored ( 10 nm bi@xmath63se@xmath64 samples ) . to compare their results for a tilted magnetic field",
    ", we next consider this situation and explore the crossover from external perpendicular to parallel ( in - plane ) magnetic field on the quantum capacitance .",
    "for a tilt angle @xmath65 with the normal of the film , the magnetic field is given by ( @xmath66 , 0 , @xmath67 ) .",
    "to describe the effects of the tilting we start from the two - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the thickness of the film .",
    "the ll energies are obtained as @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "note the dependence of the lls on the tilt angle @xmath73 as compared to eq .",
    "following the same procedure as before , we employ the energy spectrum to compute the quantum capacitance , which is plotted in fig .  4 as a function of the fermi energy ( gate voltage ) for different tilt angles .",
    "we focus on the broadening of the lls and the corresponding effects on the sdh oscillations .",
    "we fix @xmath74 t. the sdh oscillations are suppressed as we increase the tilt angle , since we are decreasing the perpendicular component of the magnetic field . for @xmath75 , when the magnetic field is almost completely aligned with the film , the sdh oscillations are washed out .",
    "the broadening of the lls generally depends on the magnetic field strength , ll index , and scattering parameters .",
    "this requires a self consistent calculation , which usually is performed numerically . in order to carry out a tractable analytical calculation we choose a constant level width of @xmath76 k. the results in fig .",
    "4 are consistent with the experimental fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an experimental investigation of transport arising from the surface states in tis is hindered by the bulk contributions due to naturally occurring defects and residual carrier doping @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the low mobility of the surface states is a serious problem .",
    "however , recent work on tis has shown a way to overcome this problem by studying transport in ultra thin samples , where a 12 times higher surface mobility as compared to the bulk can be achieved @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the large surface to volume ratio of bi@xmath77se@xmath78 thin films effectively suppresses bulk effects and enables probing of the electronic transport of the surface states @xcite .",
    "there has been a rapid improvement in the sample quality coming along with a reduction of film thicknesses @xcite .",
    "relevant to the present study , the effect of the zeeman exchange field in tis is significant @xcite with a magnitude around 50 mev due to the large effective g - factor .",
    "also , recent experiments have found a hybridization gap in the ultrathin regime ( less than 6 nm ) @xcite as well as quantum oscillations @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be expected that the effects discussed before can be realized in quantum capacitance experiments in ultrathin films .    in conclusion",
    ", we have investigated the effects of zeeman interaction and hybridization on the magnetocapacitance of a ti thin film in a perpendicular magnetic field . to this aim , we have obtained an analytic expression for the dos incorporating both the zeeman and hybridization contributions .",
    "it turns out that a combination of zeeman interaction and hybridization breaks the electron - hole symmetry , resulting in significant effects on the magnetocapacitance at @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we have shown that in the presence of both zeeman interaction and hybridization , the magnetocapacitance exhibits beating at low and level splitting at high perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this behaviour is explained by interference of the sdh oscillations at the two frequencies induced by the splitting of the lls .",
    "let us comment on the relevance of our findings for experiments .",
    "the cyclotron energy for @xmath79 t is @xmath80 mev .",
    "observation of the splitting of the lls and the discussed consequences requires that the temperature is low and the system clean enough that disorder effects do not wash out the splitting .",
    "temperature and disorder broadening thus must not reach the zeeman or hybridization energies .",
    "for a tilted magnetic field with @xmath75 we find that the sdh oscillations are washed out .",
