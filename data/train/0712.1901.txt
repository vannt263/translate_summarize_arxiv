    "one of the features of polarized dis is that a lot of the present data are in the preasymptotic region ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this is especially the case for the experiments performed at the jefferson laboratory . as was shown in @xcite , to confront correctly the qcd predictions to the experimental data including the preasymptotic region , the _ non - perturbative _ higher twist ( powers in @xmath7 ) corrections to the nucleon spin structure functions have to be taken into account too .    in this talk",
    "we discuss the impact of the recent very precise clas @xcite and compass @xcite inclusive polarized dis data on the determination of both the longitudinal polarized parton densities ( pdfs ) in the nucleon and the higher twist ( ht ) effects .",
    "these experiments give important information about the nucleon structure in quite different kinematic regions . while the clas data entirely belong to the preasymptotic region and",
    "as one can expect they should mainly influence the higher twist effects , the compass data on the spin asymmetry @xmath8 are large @xmath1 data and they should affect mainly the polarized parton densities .",
    "in addition , due to compass measurements we have for the first time accurate data at small @xmath9 , which allow to determine the behavior of the pdfs at small @xmath10 region and therefore to calculate more precisely the first moment of the nucleon spin structure @xmath2 .",
    "the method used to extract simultaneously the polarized parton densities and higher twist corrections to the spin - dependent nucleon structure function @xmath2 is described in @xcite . according to this method , the @xmath0 and @xmath11 data have been fitted using the experimental data for the unpolarized structure function @xmath12 @xmath13_{exp}~\\leftrightarrow~ { { g_1(x , q^2)_{\\rm lt}+h(x)/q^2}\\over f_1(x , q^2)_{exp}}~. \\label{g1f2rht}\\ ] ] as usual , @xmath14 is replaced by its expression in terms of the usually extracted from unpolarized dis experiments @xmath15 and @xmath16 and the phenomenological parametrizations of the experimental data for @xmath17 @xcite and the ratio @xmath18 of the longitudinal to transverse @xmath19 cross - sections @xcite are used .",
    "note that such a procedure is equivalent to a fit to @xmath20 , but it is more precise than the fit to the @xmath2 data themselves actually presented by the experimental groups because here the @xmath2 data are extracted in the same way for all of the data sets .    in eq .",
    "( [ g1f2rht ] ) `` lt '' denotes the leading twist contribution to @xmath2 @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the well known ( logarithmic in @xmath1 ) nlo pqcd contribution @xmath23 , \\label{g1partons}\\ ] ] and @xmath24 are the calculable kinematic target mass corrections @xcite , which effectively belong to the lt term . in eq .",
    "( [ g1partons ] ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are quark , anti - quark and gluon polarized densities in the proton , which evolve in @xmath1 according to the spin - dependent nlo dglap equations .",
    "@xmath27 are the nlo spin - dependent wilson coefficient functions and the symbol @xmath28 denotes the usual convolution in bjorken @xmath10 space .",
    "@xmath29 is the number of active flavors ( @xmath30 in our analysis ) .",
    "@xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ g1f2rht ] ) corresponds to the first term in the @xmath32 expansion of higher twist contribution to @xmath2 .",
    "its logarithmic @xmath1 dependence , which is not known in qcd , is neglected .",
    "compared to the principal @xmath7 dependence it is expected to be small and the accuracy of the present data does not allow its determination .",
    "therefore , the extracted from the data values of @xmath33 correspond to the mean @xmath1 for each @xmath10-bean .",
    "let us discuss now how inclusion of the clas eg1 proton and deuteron @xmath0 data @xcite and the _ new _ compass data on @xmath8 @xcite influence our previous results @xcite on polarized pdfs and higher twist obtained from the nlo qcd fit to the world data @xcite , before the clas and the latest compass data were available .",
    "the new clas @xmath34 data on @xmath0 ( 633 experimental points ) @xcite and the recent compass data on the longitudinal asymmetry @xmath8 ( 15 experimental points ) @xcite are at very different kinematic regions . while the clas data are high - precision data at low @xmath1:@xmath35 , the compass data are mainly at large @xmath1:@xmath36 and the only precise data covering the low @xmath10 region .",
    "therefore , they will play a different role in the improvement of the determination of the polarized pdfs and higher twist effects .",
    "the new pdfs and ht and their uncertainties will be compared with those of lss05 determined from our previous analysis of the world data @xcite available before the clas @xmath37 and compass06 data have appeared .",
    "r6 cm     effect of new data on the higher twist values .",
    "as the clas data are mainly low @xmath1 data where the role of ht becomes important , they should help to fix better the higher twist effects .",
    "indeed , due to the clas data , the determination of ht corrections to the proton and neutron spin structure functions , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , is significantly improved in the clas @xmath10 region , compared to the values of ht obtained from our lss05 analysis @xcite in which a nlo(@xmath40 ) qcd approximation for @xmath41 was used .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig",
    ". one can conclude now that the ht corrections for the proton target are definitely different from zero and negative in the @xmath10 region : 0.1 - 0.4 .",
    "also , including the clas data in the analysis , the ht corrections for the neutron target are better determined in the @xmath10 region : 0.2 - 0.4 .",
    "note that @xmath39 at @xmath42 was already fixed very precisely from the jlab hall a data on the ratio @xmath43 .",
    "we have found that the impact of the compass06 data on the values of higher twist corrections and their uncertainties is negligible .",
    "the only exception are the central values of ht at small @xmath10 for both the proton and the neutron targets which are slightly lower than the old ones .",
    "note that this is the only region where the compass dis events are at small @xmath1 : 1 - 4 @xmath44 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      a possible explanation of the nucleon s spin puzzle ( a ) .",
    "results of analysis for the strange axial form factor of the proton ( b ) .",
    "we have studied the impact of the clas and latest compass data on the polarized parton densities and higher twist contributions .",
    "it was demonstrated that the inclusion of the low @xmath1 clas data in the nlo qcd analysis of the world dis data improves essentially our knowledge of ht corrections to @xmath2 and does not affect the central values of pdfs , while the large @xmath1 compass data influence mainly the strange quark and gluon polarizations , but practically do not change the ht corrections .",
    "the uncertainties in the determination of polarized parton densities is significantly reduced due to both of the data sets .",
    "these results strongly support the qcd framework , in which the leading twist pqcd contribution is supplemented by higher twist terms of @xmath45 .",
    "finally , one of the important messages coming from this analysis is that it is impossible to describe the very precise clas data if the ht corrections are not taken into account .",
    "note that if the low @xmath1 data are not too accurate , it would be possible to describe them using only the leading twist term in @xmath2 ( logarithmic in @xmath1 ) , _ i.e. _ to mimic the power in @xmath1 dependence of @xmath2 with a logarithmic one ( using different forms for the input pdfs and/or more free parameters associated with them ) which was done in the analyses of another groups before the clas data were available . + * acknowledgments : * this research was supported by the jinr - bulgaria collaborative grant and by the rfbr grants ( no 05 - 01 - 00992 , no 05 - 02 - 17748 , 06 - 02 - 16215 ,",
