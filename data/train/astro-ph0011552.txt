    "the problem of the missing baryons is well known ; measurements of d in high redshift absorption line systems and application of big bang nucleosynthesis models reveal a baryon fraction , @xmath11 , @xcite while inventories of local material can account for only @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for example ) suggest that the missing baryons exist as shock - heated low - density filaments of a `` warm - hot '' intergalactic medium ( whim ) at temperatures of @xmath13 .",
    "the visibility of the whim is compromised by a number of galactic foregrounds that exist in the lower part of this temperature range , the local hot bubble ( @xmath14 , @xcite ) and the galactic halo ( @xmath15 and , perhaps @xmath16 , @xcite ) .",
    "all of these components emit predominately below e=1 kev , where galactic absorption can be significant .",
    "a component at the high end of the whim range ( e.g. , @xmath17 ) would emit strongly in the 1.5 kev band .",
    "however , @xcite has directly resolved 70 - 80% of the flux in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev range , leaving little room for diffuse components .",
    "thus , significant diffuse emission at the high end of the whim range would be difficult to reconcile with observations , while emission at the low end of the whim range becomes difficult to detect .    without high resolution , high grasp , non - dispersive x - ray spectrometers , there are three observational tests of the whim models ; the total emission , the energy spectrum , and the fluctuation spectrum .",
    "theoretical calculations by @xcite suggest that the whim produces @xmath18 kev s@xmath1 @xmath2 sr@xmath1 kev@xmath1 at 0.7 kev ; the @xcite prediction for the entire igm in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band yields the same value for the @xmath3  kev  band ( _ rosat _  r45 band ) .",
    "@xcite , however , estimate a substantially lower x - ray emission , @xmath19 kev s@xmath1 @xmath2 sr@xmath1 kev@xmath1 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "@xcite using a number of models including that of @xcite predicts that the baryon fraction as a function of temperature will be peaked near @xmath16 .",
    "finally , @xcite predict that the value of the acf of the entire extragalactic sxrb in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band should be @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "to determine a limit to the strength of the whim emission , we apply the methods of @xcite to the north galactic polar cap , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : sed ] shows broad - band data from the _ rosat",
    "_  all - sky survey ( _ rass _ ) , for the north polar cap as well as the best fit model spectrum , which is shown at a much higher energy resolution than measureable with _",
    "rosat_. the broad - band data has been corrected for band - to - band point source detection limit differences .",
    "we have assumed that the soft x - ray background ( sxrb ) is composed of the following foregrounds / backgrounds which may be successively removed .",
    "_ unresolved galactic stars : _ the model of @xcite ( similar to the model of @xcite ) has been used to calculate the spectrum of the galactic stars below the _ rass _  point source detection limit .",
    "this model reproduces the number of stellar x - ray sources in the @xmath24 to @xmath25 counts s@xmath1 range found in deep pointings , to about 10% ; unfortunately the luminosity function is expected to rise for another two orders of magnitude , so there may be larger uncertainties for the total unresolved flux .    _",
    "unresolved extragalactic point sources : _ the measured spectrum of the unresolved extragalactic point sources has been taken from @xcite who find a photon index , @xmath26 , from individual _ rosat _  and _ asca _  spectra . since the _ rass _  has a better non - cosmic background subtraction than is possible for any single pointed observation , the normalization of this extragalactic power - law was adjusted so that all of the known emission components account for all of the band r7 ( 1.05 kev @xmath27 2.04 kev ) flux .",
    "the required normalization is @xmath10 kev s@xmath1 @xmath2 sr@xmath1 kev@xmath1 , the bulk of the uncertainty is due to the systematic uncertainty in the r7 band flux , @xmath28 counts s@xmath1 arcmin@xmath29 .",
    "this value is considerably less than the recent sax value of @xmath30 kev s@xmath1 @xmath2 sr@xmath31 kev@xmath1 @xcite , and is @xmath32% higher than the heao-1 value of @xcite .",
    "it has been assumed that the extragalactic power - law does not have a break within the _ rosat _  energy range as @xcite find no break in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev range for the aggregate spectrum of a sample of their faintest _ chandra _ sources .    _ local hot bubble : _ the strength of the lhb is determined from the variation of observed flux with total absorbing column in the manner of @xcite and @xcite .    _",
    "the remainder : _ the remaining flux contains contributions from all components beyond the galactic absorption that are not due to the unresolved extragalactic point sources ; the galactic halo and any extragalactic diffuse emission . the right panel of figure  [ fig : sed ] shows this remainder after correction for the galactic absorption .",
    "as @xcite showed that the emission from beyond the galactic absorption can not be fit by a single thermal component , we fit this remainder with two @xcite model components ; the lack of independent spectral resolution elements prohibits fitting a greater number of components .",
    "the fits to the north polar cap produce temperatures similar to those found in @xcite for @xmath33 , despite the differences in analysis ( subtraction of the composite stellar spectrum and the renormalization of the epl ) ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the strength of the soft component varies strongly across the sky while the strength of the hard component is quite uniform @xcite , at least at relatively high galactic latitudes ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the angular variation of the soft component suggests a galactic origin , while the uniformity of the hard component suggests that it is due either to a galactic corona in hydrostatic equilibrium , or extragalactic emission .",
    "there is no way , on the basis of _ rosat _  photometry , to separate galactic halo emission from diffuse extragalactic emission .",
    "therefore , the upper limit to the diffuse extragalactic emission is the strength of the hard component , @xmath37 kev s@xmath1 @xmath2 sr@xmath1 kev@xmath1 in the@xmath3  kev  band .",
    "note that the minimum @xmath38  kev  emission from beyond the galactic absorption is @xmath18 kev s@xmath1 @xmath2 sr@xmath1 kev@xmath1 @xcite , consistent with the @xmath38  kev  flux produced by the hard component .",
    "one might hope to place a limit on the contribution of the galactic halo by considering the halos of milky way analogues .",
    "m101 is the closest face - on milky way analogue , though its @xmath39 is about twice that of the milky way , and its star formation rate as measured by @xmath40 is a factor of @xmath9 lower than the milky way .",
    "the sun is @xmath41 from the galactic center ; at an equivalent radius in m101 the upper limit of the @xmath3  kev  surface brightness due to m101 ( which would include its halo and some emission from its disk ) is half the strength of our hard component in the same band .",
    "however , for ngc 891 , which has about half the mass of the milky way , a similar @xmath39 , and a similar @xmath40 , an observer at @xmath41 from its center would see a galactic halo that is @xmath42 times brighter than our hard component @xcite !",
    "the relation between the strength of the halo and the stellar formation rate is not sufficiently understood to determine the fraction of the hard component that might be due to our own galactic halo .",
    "the fraction of baryons at each temperature in the @xcite model is shown in @xcite .",
    "the baryon fraction at @xmath43 is peaked at @xmath44 ; if the baryon fraction were weighted by the emission at each temperature , the distribution would be more sharply peaked and at somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "the contribution of baryons at higher @xmath45 is substantially smaller than that of baryons at @xmath43 and is peaked at somewhat lower temperatures ( @xmath46 at @xmath47 ) . given the caveats above , the agreement of the temperature of our hard component ( @xmath48 ) with the `` characteristic '' temperature predicted by the simulations is comforting , but may be completely fortuitous if the bulk of the emission is due to the galactic halo .",
    "we have determined the autocorrelation function ( acf ) for the @xmath3  kev  band ( _ rosat _  band r45 ) from seven mosaics of deep pspc pointings .",
    "the non - cosmic background of each pspc pointing was removed using esas @xcite , all @xmath49 point sources were removed , the image was restricted to the inner @xmath50 , and the resulting data were mosaicked @xcite .",
    "the remaining non - cosmic background was removed by comparing the mosaics to the _ rass _  . using the variation of transmitted flux with column density , we determined the strength of the lhb in the r1l2 band , extrapolated this quantity to the r45 band , and removed it from the image . as the point source detection limit varies across each mosaic",
    ", the mosaics were corrected using the extragalactic point source @xmath51 of @xcite and the galactic stellar luminosity function of @xcite . each r45 band mosaic",
    "was then corrected for galactic absorption .",
    "the resultant image contains contributions from the galactic halo , the unresolved extragalactic point sources , and the extragalactic diffuse emission .",
    "once all the corrections were determined , the mosaics were reconstructed using only the central @xmath52 radius region of each pointing .",
    "the smallest scale for which one may meaningfully calculate the acf is the size of the largest psf , @xmath53 .",
    "( although the _ rosat _  psf is @xmath54 on axis , the size of the psf grows rapidly with distance from the optical axis . )    for each mosaic we calculated the acf , @xmath55 ^ 2   \\sum\\limits_{i , i^{\\prime } } \\sqrt{w w^{\\prime}}}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all pairs of pixels seperated by @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the count rate in those pixels , and @xmath58 is the statistical weight ( the exposure time ) given to those pixel we find that there is a significant mosaic - to - mosaic variation in the acf , which was confirmed by variance analyses ( @xmath59 ) of the mosaics .",
    "the acfs of individual mosaics were weighted by the mean exposure to calculate the mean acf shown in figure  [ fig : acf ] .",
    "as the effective point source detection limit for a mosaic can be much smaller than for individual exposures , the acf contains a contribution from residual point sources whose psf radii range up to @xmath53 ; the maximum possible contribution due to the residual point sources is shown by the dashed line .",
    "thus , the acf shown is the upper limit for scales smaller than @xmath60 .    the short line labeled `` sh '' is the acf determined by @xcite for the _ rosat",
    "_  r67 band ( 0.73 kev @xmath27 2.04 kev ) ; over the interval shown it is nearly consistent with zero .",
    "the dotted lines show the acfs from @xcite , corrected from their energy band ( _ rosat _  band r45 + r67 ) to our band energy ( _ rosat _  band r45 ) , assuming that the fluctuations in the r67 band are negligible for these scales .",
    "the upper line is their measured acf ; the lower line is the acf that they derived by fitting the data with the function @xmath61 .",
    "we chose to measure the acf in the @xmath3  kev  band as the hard component discussed in the previous section will have a stronger contribution in this band at higher energies , but there will not be as great a problem with galactic absorption as there is at lower energies .",
    "however , the only published model acf @xcite is for the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "since the @xcite acf for higher energies is much smaller than that for the @xmath3  kev  band , the acf for the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band can be estimated from our acf by scaling it by the quantity @xmath62 ^2,\\ ] ] which is @xmath63 .",
    "taking the acf for the @xmath53 psf mosaics , we find that the acf in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band should be @xmath64 for @xmath8 .",
    "this is about a factor of five smaller than the model predictions .",
    "there may , in fact , be contributions to the acf due to the galactic halo and the lhb , but these are expected to be small .",
    "the acf for emission from the lhb has been measured for the @xmath8 range and is consistent with zero @xcite .",
    "such a direct comparison of theory and observation is not correct .",
    "the linear size of the @xcite simulation ( @xmath65 ) corresponds to @xmath66 mpc@xmath67 at a distance of 500 mpc@xmath67 and contains an x - ray emitting cluster of galaxies .",
    "since the mean separation of clusters is several times larger than 8 mpc@xmath67 , the simulation has an atypical overdensity ( hence atypically large concentration of x - ray emission ) , and thus a higher value of the acf .",
    "the observed acfs show variation among mosaics with solid angles of 10 to 30 square degrees ; the root of the variance of our set of seven mosaics is about twice the displayed uncertainty .",
    "this variation may be consistent with cosmic variation .",
    "we have determined the upper limit to the strength of diffuse extragalactic emission in the soft x - ray range , by `` peeling off '' various known foregrounds and backgrounds .",
    "what is left is some combination of extragalactic diffuse emission and galactic halo emission .",
    "we expect our galaxy to have an x - ray halo simply due to hydrostatic equilibrium ( the virial temperature is @xmath68 k ) and because other galaxies like our own have them .",
    "the strength of the halo remains a vexed issue .",
    "the combined halo / extragalactic emission weighs in at just about the strength expected for the extragalactic component alone , so either our galaxy has very little halo , or the models over - predict the x - ray emission of the whim .",
    "the lower @xcite value suggests that more care may be needed in comparing simulations to measurements .",
    "it should be noted that this analysis has used a normalization for the contribution by the unresolved extragalactic point souces that is at the _ lower _ end of the range of values commonly used .",
    "independent of the existence of extragalactic diffuse emission , or the existence of a galactic halo , the _ rass _  will not admit to a higher value for the normalization .",
    "increasing the normalization decreases the amount of flux available for the extragalactic diffuse emission to significantly smaller than that predicted by the models .    the upper limit to",
    "the acf in the @xmath3  kev  band is smaller , by about a factor of five , than that predicted by the models at a scale of @xmath60 , and all the improvements to the measurement of the acf ( better correction for residual point sources and more robust estimates of the contribution to the fluctuations by the halo and the lhb ) will only further decrease the value of the acf . if a portion of the hard component strength is due to the galactic halo , the weakness of the observed acf signal may be due to the reduced strength of the extragalactic emission .",
    "however , as noted above , one should compare our mean acf with the acf of a simulation whose size is comparable to the cluster correlation length rather than a small region surrounding a cluster .",
    "the observed emission strength , energy spectrum , and fluctuation spectrum of the soft x - ray background originating from beyond the galactic absorption is roughly consistent with the predictions by hydrodynamical simulations of the universe .",
    "even given the caveats concerning the galactic halo , the current observations do not _ disprove _ the existing models .",
    "the observations here present solid guideposts for further exploration of the accessible parameter space by future generations of simulations .",
