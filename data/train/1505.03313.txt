    "a subtle interplay of polymerizing or depolymerizing steps , involving single g - actin monomers at the barbed end , provides the essential mechanism allowing the cytoskeletal network to keep contact while maintaining a permanent pressure force on a load resisting membrane .    in vitro experiments on biofilaments , like actin and tubulin , to measure in supercritical conditions either the force - velocity relationship in detectable non - zero velocity conditions@xcite , or the approach to stalling where the applied load effectively stops the net polymerization of living filaments and",
    "the stalling force is effectively measured@xcite , have been deviced . to simplify the analysis and to concentrate on the fundamental process of force generation by polymerizing filaments",
    ", the experiments deal with bundles of parallel filaments hitting an orthogonal moving wall , a network having strong analogy with the structure of actin filopedia@xcite .",
    "data analysis requires models for bundle dynamics and stalling force predictions , and in general , most models treat living filaments as perfectly rigid .    in a series of pioneering papers on this topics in the eighties ,",
    "hill was the first to propose the expression  @xcite @xmath26 for the force generated by a bundle of @xmath27 growing ( proto)filaments stopped by a normal wall . in eq.([eq : force ] ) , @xmath2 is the absolute temperature , @xmath7 is the effective monomer size along the filament contour ( equal to half the g - actin diameter as there are two interwined protofilaments in f - actin ) and @xmath28 is the reduced free monomer density equal to the ratio of bulk polymerizing and depolymerizing rates @xmath29 and @xmath30 . using a combination of thermodynamic and mean - field arguments @xcite , this expression has been established as the equilibrium state ( zero growth velocity ) of a more general expression linking the wall velocity and the load force for a bundle of filaments in a generally non equilibrium framework . as stressed by hill , eq .",
    "( [ eq : force ] ) is derived from a one - dimensional longitudinal and incompressible model which implies a proportionality between the average polymerization rate and the average wall velocity .",
    "the 1d brownian ratchet model for an individual rigid filament hitting a moving wall was later proposed to offer a physically justified stochastic model  @xcite .",
    "the living filament is subject to random polymerizing and depolymerizing steps with respective rates @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 to treat supercritical conditions",
    ". while the depolymerizing step is possible even in presence of the wall , the polymerizing step is only accepted if it does not lead to an overlap with the moving wall .",
    "in addition the wall undergoes a 1d brownian motion characterized by a diffusion coefficient and by a load which biases the wall dynamics towards the filament s end .",
    "the coupling between the filament ( de)polymerization dynamics and the wall random motion leads to a stalling force in agreement with eq.([eq : force ] ) and to a stationary drift velocity of the wall , which for large wall diffusion coefficient , agrees with hill s prediction of the load - velocity law .",
    "when many parallel filaments act together as a bundle , the brownian rachet model can be generalized to a multi - rigid filament system while remaining essentially 1d @xcite .",
    "the dynamical coupling among filaments via the common wall evolution , which is very sensitive to the relative longitudinal disposition of the filaments , has strong implication on the velocity - load relationship @xcite .",
    "let us note that all the above models consider non interacting filaments and a single kind of actin - adenosine triphosphate ( actin - atp ) complex for the monomers whether free or incorporated into filaments .",
    "the above dynamical models can be generalized to take into account lateral interactions among filaments @xcite mainly to treat a many - protofilaments model and/or the hydrolysis of the atp(guanosine triphosphate - gtp ) in the filament actin - complexes ( tubulin - complexes ) by considering additional types of complexes , requiring in turn additional information on specific rates @xcite .    if rigid filament models are certainly satisfactory as long as the elementary working filaments ( being isolated and uncrosslinked ) remain sufficiently short , the flexibility of f - actin should be properly considered for longer filaments . flexibility was found to be relevant in some important experimental cases .",
    "the bending shape of single f - actin filaments observed by fluorescence spectroscopy , was precisely exploited to measure for the first time the typical polymerization force generated by single living actin filaments @xcite . in the optical trap experiment of footer et al.@xcite ,",
    "a bundle of about ten filaments , with their seeds glued to a trapped colloidal particle , push with their active side ( barbed end ) on a fixed rigid wall .",
    "the polymerization force they progressively develop to reach equilibrium is inferred by measuring the colloidal displacement in the trap .",
    "the interpretation of the experiments was possible only by assuming the presence of escaping filaments in the bundle ( filaments growing parallel to the obstacle wall after a large angle bending fluctuation ) , a phenomenon interpreted by the authors as rod buckling related the beam elastic instability @xcite . despite care in eliminating data potentially polluted by escaping filaments , the measured stalling force for a eight filament bundle was ( repeatedly ) found to be close to eq.([eq : force ] ) with @xmath32 instead of the expected @xmath33 filaments number , a result still presently not understood .",
    "that flexibility leads , in some extreme cases , to escaping filaments was reported and analyzed in a non equilibrium simulation of a model of single living filament hitting a moving wall in which filament flexibility was explicitly taken into account@xcite .",
    "quite generally , in these pseudo - stationary simulations with constant load , a wall velocity enhancement was found with respect to the predictions of the `` rigid filament - hard wall '' ratchet model , in agreement with theoretical considerations which have generally predicted an enhancement of the efficiency of the conversion of chemical free energy into useful work when realistic filament flexibility is included@xcite . for large loads ( still below the stalling force ) and for large seed - wall distances ,",
    "some escaping filaments were detected during the drift of the wall @xcite .",
    "it was argued that this phenomenon is related but distinct from rod buckling and hence was denoted as the `` pushing catastrophe '' .",
    "the consensus seems to be that to efficiently grow against membrane resistance , actin filaments should be neither too short ( short filaments are too rigid to intercalate easily a polymerizing monomer between the tip of the filament and the wall ) nor too long as the load would simply buckle them , the optimal range @xmath34 being cited in a recent review article@xcite .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the equilibrium statistical mechanical treatment of a semi - flexible filament in a slab . in section [ sec : therm ] , extending previous work @xcite , we establish within the reactive grand canonical ensemble , the grand potential for a living filament in contact with an obstacle wall at fixed temperature and fixed free monomer chemical potential .",
    "formal expressions for the size distribution and the equilibrium force on the obstacle wall are established .",
    "section [ actin ] deals specifically with f - actin modeled as a living discrete wormlike chain ( d - wlc ) . we first define the model and the related range of physical parameters to probe the non - escaping regime of the filament .",
    "we then compute , by monte carlo simulation , the compression - force law for a dead ( non - reacting ) d - wlc in the slab and validate , in the non - escaping regime , the weak bending expression of gholami et al @xcite .",
    "subsequently we define the filament force averaged over a distance equal to a monomer size @xmath7 , crucial for the comparison with hill s prediction , in section [ comparison ] we introduce the stalling force and compare the predictions for flexible ( finite @xmath0 ) against rigid ( @xmath35 ) models , proving for the latter hill s expression for the stalling force . in the entire range of filament lengths corresponding to the non - escaping regime ,",
    "the flexible filament has a stalling force only few percents larger than a rigid filament ( hill s law ) .",
    "nonetheless , the specific @xmath9-dependence of the force ( @xmath36 ) resulting from buckled filaments hitting the obstacle wall , induces a spectacular , previously undetected , effect of flexibility .",
    "since the stalling force is nearly independent of the slab s width @xmath9 in the non - escaping regime , this requires a systematic evolution with @xmath37 of the fraction of sizes of the filament touching the wall .",
    "this is discussed in section [ distr ] .",
    "finally , section [ discussion ] provides some general conclusions and perspectives on the flexibility issue for many filaments bundles , including both static properties and dynamic aspects linked directly to the exploration of the force - load relationship .",
    "we consider a reacting ideal mixture in a slab at temperature @xmath2 consisting of @xmath38 monomers which can either be free ( g actin - atp complex ) or integrated within a single self - assembled filament ( f - actin ) with fixed persistence length @xmath0 . in the f - actin case",

    "( [ eq : central ] ) also predicts that @xmath375 hence , in the rigid limit @xmath376 , @xmath377 which demonstrates the impulsive character of the force when the rigid filament hits the wall during its brownian fluctuations .",
    "the ability of actin filaments to sustain in supercritical conditions a compressive force has predominantly been justified with the aid of the rigid living filament model , effectively a one dimensional model , both for the single filament case and for bundles of parallel filaments@xcite .",
    "the 1d filaments which are fluctuating in length as a result of ( de)polymerizing steps are hitting a fluctuating obstacle usually subject to load by producing instantaneous kicks which result into a time averaged force biasing the obstacle brownian motion .",
    "these brownian ratchet dynamical models do lead to an effective polymerizing force , compatible with hill s force expression at stalling , which satisfies a specific velocity - load relationship either for the single filament case @xcite or for few bundle models differing mainly by the longitudinal disposition of filaments @xcite . when hill s prediction for a bundle of @xmath378 actin filaments has been found to fail in interpreting experimental data @xcite ,",
    "the role of flexibility has been invoked by introducing an ad - hoc maximum value for the force that a bunble can exert and beyond which the bundle buckles . however",
    "even this ad - hoc extension of the 1d model did not provide a satisfactory interpretation of the experiments . in the present paper and in its future extensions ,",
    "we develop a statistical mechanics theory for a flexible filament model and we show that , quite generally , it leads to a systematic and continuous evolution of the filament behavior from a rigid rod character at short contour lengths to a pronounced flexible character at longer contour lengths , ending ultimately with the so called pushing catastrophe limit@xcite , when the filament(s ) has(ve ) acquired a finite probability to grow unimpeded by the wall and escape laterally . while our approach will involve ultimately multi - filament bundles , moving obstacles under various loads thus implying non equilibrium situations , in this work we have focused on the already very rich phenomenology offered by the basic equilibrium properties of a single grafted filament in supercritical conditions , as it hits a fixed wall oriented normally to its grafting direction .",
    "we have incorporated the living character and the flexibility of the filament explicitly into a statistical mechanics approach based on the reactive grand canonical ensemble , dealing with the model of a discrete wlc hitting a hard wall .",
    "this formalism has been illustrated by the f - actin / free g - actin reacting mixture restricted to a single kind of actin monomer - atp complexes .",
    "the results and the new phenomenology which emerges from the present work can be summarized as follows    * we provide a statistical mechanics justification of the popular hill s expression for the single filament stalling force@xcite .",
    "rigorously , this expression corresponds to the average force exerted by the filament ( defined as the ratio of the mechanical work over a finite displacement and the displacement itself ) , as the wall moves reversibly , under mechanical and chemical equilibrium , over a distance corresponding to one monomer size @xmath7 .",
    "the hill s expression is found to be strictly valid only for the rigid filament case and we derive explicitly the correction terms for the semi - flexible case . the correction is positive and @xmath9-dependent for the model of a hard wall hit by a discrete wlc ( the force is larger than for the rigid case ) but these flexibility effects are only of the order of the percent when the experimental value of the actin persistence length is used .",
    "so we conclude that the @xmath9-independent hill s expression remains a very good approximation for the stalling force of semi - flexible filaments like actin .",
    "it should be stressed however that the force exerted by the filament on a fixed wall in the reactive grand canonical ensemble , that is the force which was integrated to get the work over a finite displacement of size @xmath7 , shows large fluctuations around the mean . these fluctuations which decrease progressively in amplitude as @xmath9 increases , find their origin in commensurability effects related to the degree of matching of the filament contour length , necessarily an integer number of monomer sizes @xmath7 , with respect to the gap width @xmath9 .",
    "these effects become less pronounced at large @xmath9 as the amplitude of tip transverse fluctuations due to bending become more important . * like for the rigid case@xcite , the equilibrium size distribution of the living flexible filament whose net polymerization is stopped in supercritical conditions by a wall at position @xmath9 , starts as a growing exponential , as long as the filament size is too short for its set of fluctuating configurations to interact directly with the hard wall .",
    "filament configurations larger than the slab gap have zero probability for the 1d rigid model , while for flexible filaments the size distribution generally presents a fast decay which involves some finite but rapidly decreasing probability to get filament contour lengths larger than @xmath9 .",
    "this rapid decay results from a filament bending work penalty which systematically exceeds the gain in chemical free energy , as a result of polymerization steps beyond the largest size @xmath379 of non touching filaments . given the mentioned large oscillations in equilibrium properties as the gap width @xmath9 is varied over sub monomer length scales , the filament size distribution properties are better discussed in terms of their @xmath7-averaged ( average over a @xmath7 window around the wall position @xmath9 ) .",
    "the knowledge of these distributions ( function of slab gap @xmath9 ) allows to adopt a quantitative definition for the limit of the non - escaping regime .",
    "in particular we require that the probability of a planar filament configuration of length @xmath380 , the minimum length to laterally escaping , be three orders of magnitude smaller than the probability of having filaments of length just below @xmath9 .",
    "our work provides the opportunity to establish more precisely the characteristics of the crossover towards the escaping regime , a point of high relevance in in - vitro experiments@xcite .",
    "* at stalling , in the non escaping regime , the quasi @xmath9 independence of the d - average force is produced by the fraction of filament configurations hitting the wall .",
    "the cumulative probability @xmath381 of the size distribution involving hitting filaments has been shown to increase like @xmath382 .",
    "this observation is compatible with the buckled filament state of the large majority of hitting filaments of the ensemble , each of them exerting adiabatically the classical plateau force expression @xmath383 ( here , adiabatic refers to the assumption that the life time of a given filament size is long with respect to the microscopic relaxation time of a fixed contour length filament ) . in this way",
    "the product @xmath384 is compatible with the @xmath9 independent stalling force expression of hill , which allows us to pinpoint a major distinction between rigid and flexible living filaments , a distinction established here for the case of a single filament at equilibrium but which will be relevant for multi - filament bundles at and outside equilibrium . for finite @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath385 limit of very short semi - flexible filaments leads to a contact probability @xmath386 and a buckling force @xmath387 , just like in the case of rigid filaments ( @xmath388 ) at arbitrary @xmath9 .",
    "hitting the obstacle takes the form of instantaneous kicks both for single filaments and multi - filament bundles . for flexible filaments of given @xmath0 ,",
    "the fraction of hitting filaments grows quadratically with @xmath9 while the force of each ( buckled ) filament decreases quadratically with @xmath9 .",
    "if we consider a dynamical trajectory of a single living flexible filament at equilibrium against a wall at distance @xmath9 , the fraction of time the filament is in contact with the wall is finite together with the associated ( buckling ) exerted force . for bundles of @xmath378 filaments at equilibrium , supposed to act independently ,",
    "the force is produced by the permanent recruitment of a subset of @xmath389 filaments pressing each with the buckling force @xmath390 , the subset of hitting filaments permuting continuously among the @xmath27 equivalent filaments as the result of continuous ( de)polymerization steps .",
    "finally , as @xmath9 approaches @xmath391 under stalling conditions , which coincides with the upper limit of the non - escaping regime , the fraction @xmath392 should approach unity as the polymerizing force exerted by a filament can not exceed @xmath393 .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of the limit is provided by eq .",
    "( [ eq : de ] ) which shows that the probability to get escaping filaments starts to be non negligible when @xmath392 approaches @xmath394 .",
    "a conjecture is possible when extending the criteria to observe the pushing catastrophe to the stationary situation of a wall moving at constant velocity , pushed by the polymerizing bundle of @xmath395 filaments and subject to a load @xmath396 smaller than the stalling value ( @xmath397 ) @xcite . to keep a constant velocity of the wall ,",
    "the bundle must exert a force equal to the load @xmath398 ( or sightly larger if solvent friction is considered ) , therefore the number of filaments @xmath399",
    "needed to press on the wall should go as @xmath400 in order to compensate for the variation of the single filament force @xmath401 . if we assume that the non - escaping limit in stationary conditions ( @xmath402 ) would correspond to the recruitment of all @xmath27 filaments ( or a permanent contact with the wall for the single filament case @xmath403 ) , the maximum gap tolerated should be at least a factor @xmath404 larger than the limiting value for the non - escaping regime at stalling .",
    "it is illuminating to compare the above considerations with two reported experimental measurements of the actin polymerizing force .",
    "the experiments of footer et al .",
    "@xcite use an optical trap set up to measure the stalling force of a few actin filaments in supercritical conditions .",
    "in particular , they report in figure 4b data corresponding to a polymerizing force of @xmath405 at reduced concentration @xmath176 which , as they observe , corresponds to the stalling force of a single actin filament .",
    "the average filament length is @xmath406 for the chosen optical trap .",
    "eq.([eq : central ] ) applied to this case would imply a contact time fraction of @xmath407 with a force intensity of @xmath408 , the probed filament length being indeed lower than the limit @xmath409 predicted by eq.([eq : de ] ) .",
    "this experiment was in fact dealing with a bundle of @xmath33 filaments but surprisingly enough the stalling force of a single filament was effectively recorded .",
    "the issue here is still under debate but , according to our present work , to detect a force eight times larger at the same reduced concentration in free monomers , a trap force constant @xmath353 larger would be required in order to avoid laterally escaping filaments .    the demoulin et al .",
    "experiment @xcite probes the force - velocity relationship for a set of actin bundles@xcite , implying a total of @xmath410 filaments at @xmath411 , pressing together against a bead .",
    "while the stalling force in this case is around @xmath412 , the bead is subject to load forces ranging from a few @xmath413 ( largest velocity probed ) up to @xmath414 covering a range @xmath415 for the load over stalling forces ratio .",
    "looking at figure 2 in ref.@xcite , if we take a typical length of @xmath171 for the actin filaments beyond their lateral connection by fascin bridges , the number of filaments at contact able to press on the obstacle bead with a buckling force of @xmath416 should lie between @xmath185 and @xmath417 over the explored force range .",
    "further , considering the results for the longest filaments @xmath418 at @xmath419 , our criterium above for stationary non - escaping conditions is still justified since @xmath420 at @xmath421 , and @xmath422 in these conditions leading to a maximum length of the stationary non - escaping regime of @xmath423 , still larger than the probed bundle length .",
    "further consequences of filament semi - flexible character on actin bundles at and outside equilibrium will be discussed in future publications@xcite .",
    "we thank m. baus , m. j. footer and b. mognetti for useful discussions and g. destree and p. pirotte for technical help .",
    "this work has been supported by the italian institute of technology ( iit ) under the seed project grant 259 simbedd and by the italian ministery of research under project prin2012  2012nnrkaf .",
    "phenomenological kinetic rate constants @xmath424 and @xmath425 are usually associated to the reactions described by eqs.([eq : reaction ] ) . in terms of such kinetic constants",
    "the equilibrium micro - reversibility conditions , i.e. the equality between the number of polymerizations of filaments of size @xmath138 to size @xmath11 and the number of de - polymerizations of filaments of size @xmath11 to size @xmath138 per unit of time , are written as @xmath426 which implies , according to eq.([eq : k0i ] ) and thermodynamics , the link @xmath427 eq.([eq : kk ] ) is often written equivalently as @xmath428 where @xmath429 and @xmath430 are ( de-)polymerisation rates , respectively . using again eq.([eq : k0i ] ) , their ratio is @xmath431 the ( de)polymerization rates for filament ends in bulk , denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath432 , are valid for our grafted filaments , as long as they do not interact with the wall . when @xmath433 ( that is the free monomer density is critical @xmath434 ) , one has @xmath435 so that the rate of polymerization and rate of depolymerization are equal and the distribution should be uniform in the short filaments region ( @xmath436 ) .",
    "we are interested to the supercritical regime @xmath168 and @xmath31 for which the distribution in the same short filament region is a growing exponential . for ( de)polymerization reactions implying filaments hitting the wall , the rates satisfying eq.([eq : ratiow ] )",
