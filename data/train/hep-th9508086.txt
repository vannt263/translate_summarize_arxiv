    "a unique boundary value problem is posed , for example , by assuming dirichlet- or robin - boundary conditions on the field .    in an ultrastatic spacetime the quantum field theory at finite temperature may be developed in complete analogy with the minkowski - space theory and that is why we will skip the details of the calculation . in the euclidean formulation of the finite temperature theory ,",

    "an exact analysis of the casimir energy for this spacetime is possible since it reduces to a case of the chowla - selberg zeta function ( when @xmath60 ) or to one of the extended formula that has been obtained recently ( case @xmath61 ) .",
    "in fact , in the case when @xmath56 , the relevant formula is a particular application of the following .",

    "we will impose the additional condition that @xmath65 be such that @xmath66 , for all @xmath67 * z*. in the usual applications of the theory , those conditions are indeed satisfied .",

    "the good convergence properties of expression ( [ cs1 ] ) , that were so much prised by chowla and selberg , are shared by its non - trivial extension ( [ gcs ] ) .",
    "this renders the use of the formula quite simple .",
    "in fact , the two first terms are just nice under the form ( [ zeh1]) while the last one ( impressive in appearence ) is even more quickly convergent than in the case of eq .",
    "( [ cs1 ] ) , and thus absolutely harmless in practice .",
    "only a few first terms of the three series of bessel functions in ( [ gcs ] ) , ( [ zeh1 ] ) need to be calculated , even if one demands good accuracy .",
    "we should also notice that the only pole of ( [ cs1 ] ) at @xmath77 appears through @xmath78 in the second term , while for @xmath79 , the apparent singularities of the first and second terms cancel each other and no pole is formed .",
    "analogously , the pole at @xmath79 in ( [ gcs ] ) comes only from the first term .",
    "( [ gcs ] ) also has these good properties , _ for any non - negative value of _ @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , for large @xmath65 the convergence properties of the series of bessel functions are clearly enhanced , while for @xmath65 small we get back to the case of chowla and selberg .",
    "notice , however , that this is not obtained through the high-@xmath65 expansion ( e.g. , just putting @xmath74 in ( [ gcs ] ) ) , but using a low-@xmath65 , binomial expansion of the kind _ n=0^ ^-s= a^-s _ m=0^ ( ) ^m _ h ( 2s+2m , c ) , which is convergent for @xmath80 . for @xmath81 it reduces to @xmath82",
    ". actually , formula ( [ gcs ] ) is still valid in a domain of negative @xmath65 s , namely for @xmath83 .",
    "turning now to the particular application of the formula in our specific situation , we see that the zeta function corresponding to the laplace - beltrami operator in the massive ( resp .",
