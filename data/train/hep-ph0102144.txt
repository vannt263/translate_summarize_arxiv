    "( this is similar to the usual top / stop sector , but now all three mirror families may contribute ) .",
    "the mn2ssm higgs sector is less constrained than that of the mssm or other @xmath123 frameworks . in particular , any one of the four higgs doublets which appear in mn2ssm @xcite could participate in ewsb .",
    "even when assuming for simplicity a mssm - like higgs structure with two - doublets participating in the ewsb , the @xmath4 two - higgs - doublet spectrum could be quite different from that of the mssm .",
    "this is because the tree - level higgs quartic couplings @xmath178 arise not only from supersymmetric terms @xmath179 , for @xmath180 being the gauge coupling , as in the mssm , but also from hard supersymmetry breaking operators ( whose generation goes hand in hand with that of the effective yukawa couplings ) @xmath181 @xcite , where @xmath182 is the contribution from higher order operators in the khler potential .",
    "therefore , the usual mssm relations among the higgs mass eigenvalues @xmath183 ( assuming @xmath184 ) no longer hold , and the physical higgs mass spectrum is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "this observation is generic to any theory with low - energy supersymmetry breaking where @xmath185 is realized @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that models with higher dimensions often lead after compactification to an effective @xmath4 structure in four - dimensions .",
    "therefore , our analysis of @xmath4 models and of the associated mirror families may be applied in certain cases to theories with large extra dimensions .",
    "it was shown above that one extra chiral generation ( @xmath186 ) can be accommodated by the precision data with the sm higgs mass up to about @xmath187gev .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "in fact , the @xmath190 case , as predicted in the mn2ssm , requires additional new physics contributions ( beyond that of a single higgs doublet ) to the oblique parameters .",
    "the minimal version of such an extension is to invoke the two - higgs - doublet sector . for generality ( and being consistent with the @xmath4 framework described above )",
    ", we will consider a general 2hdm .",
    "thus , our analysis is valid for any given model which contains two higgs doublets together with extra families , and our constraints on the parameter space can be readily applied to any such model .",
    "the two - higgs - doublet sector can lead to a large negative @xmath121 ( cf .",
    "sec.[sec:2hdm ] ) which will cancel to a large part the three - family fermionic @xmath191 , and render the sum @xmath192 consistent with the experimental bounds over certain regions of the parameter space . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume the second and third families to have the same mass spectrum as the first family .",
    "this interplay is explored in fig.[fig : threeg ] , which is based on an initial sample of 50000 models .",
    "allowed models are determined by imposing the @xmath174 bounds of @xmath32 .",
    "figs.[fig : threeg](a ) and ( b ) display the extra fermions and the higgs bosons spectra , respectively .",
    "we choose , for illustration , a typical set of higgs inputs @xmath193gev and @xmath194 in ( a ) , and a set of fermionic inputs @xmath195gev , @xmath196gev in ( b ) , where three values of @xmath125 are shown .",
    "figs.[fig : threeg](c ) and ( d ) display the allowed points , with the same inputs as ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , in the @xmath49 plane for comparison with the experimental bounds .",
    "variation of @xmath197gev in the @xmath198gev range does not change the results .",
    "also , for clarity , only @xmath199 is shown in ( d ) , but similar results are obtained for the case of @xmath200 , or , @xmath201 .",
    "= 11 cm    the choice of the above higgs inputs in figs.[fig : threeg](a ) and ( c ) corresponds to a small allowed region in the @xmath202 plane , i.e. , the mirror leptons ( dots ) are highly non - degenerate , while the mirror quarks ( circles ) exhibit much smaller isospin breaking .",
    "similar results could be obtained for other choices of higgs masses , where the higgs contribution @xmath121 is sizable and negative . from fig.[fig : threeg](b ) , one observes that the allowed regions are quite distinct for three choices of @xmath203 . for @xmath204 , @xmath154 could vary in a wide range [ corresponding to case ( ia ) ] for @xmath205gev . in all other cases ,",
    "the heavier neutral higgs @xmath206 has to be generally much lighter than 1tev .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath207gev ( i.e. , slightly heavier than @xmath208 ) , the charged higgs mass @xmath209 is confined into two very narrow regions around either @xmath210gev or @xmath211gev , for a sizable range of @xmath125 .",
    "finally , figs.[fig : threeg](c ) and ( d ) indicate that the relevant viable parameter space typically corresponds to @xmath212 and @xmath213 . in comparison with the scenario of one - generation and one - higgs - doublet [ cf .",
    ", fig.[fig : oneg](c)-(d ) ] , the viable region in the @xmath49 plane of fig.[fig : threeg](c)-(d ) has a smaller @xmath192 .",
    "this is due to the more negative @xmath121 values contributed by the two - higgs - doublet sector .",
    "clearly , there are strong correlations among the allowed higgs and the fermion mass ranges in the @xmath214 scenario .",
    "this renders the model highly restrictive in its parameter space , and it is thus instructive and encouraging for the relevant experimental tests at the upcoming colliders , such as the tevatron run - ii , the lhc and the future lepton colliders .",
    "collider signatures , however , merit a dedicated study and will not be discussed here . before concluding this subsection , we note that in the above we did not address explicitly the less difficult case of @xmath215 .",
    "we expect that @xmath216 can be accommodated over larger regions of the 2hdm parameter space .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated that one extra generation of relatively light non - degenerate chiral fermions in the mass range , @xmath217 , can be consistent with current precision electroweak data without requiring additional new physics source .",
    "sizable mass splitting between up- and down - type fermions can lead to a large positive @xmath18 without significantly increasing @xmath58 .",
    "this can largely relax the upper bound from precision data on the mass of a sm - like higgs boson , as shown in fig.[fig : oneg ] .",
    "the case of three extra chiral families was shown to be viable when invoking extra new physics , most notably , a two - higgs - doublet extension . in order to remain model - independent",
    ", we performed the analysis for three extra families with a general two - higgs - doublet sector .",
    "we found , after imposing the oblique precision bounds , a highly restrictive mass spectrum for either the fermion sector or higgs sector ( cf .",
    ", fig.[fig : threeg ] ) , which can lead to various distinct collider signatures .",
    "the importance of the two - higgs - doublet sector is in providing a negative contribution to @xmath18 , and thus allowing for a large isospin violation in the three family fermion sector .",
    "we have used weak - scale @xmath4 supersymmetry@xcite as an explicit theory framework to motivate our study and to define the relevant mass range for the extra chiral families under consideration [ cf .",
    ", ( [ eq : mirrorf - mr ] ) ] , as well as to define the higgs sector .",
    "we note that such an effective four - dimensional @xmath4 structure can be a consequence of the compactification of certain extra - dimensional theories .",
    "possible extensions of our study may include : @xmath218 a more exhaustive parameter scan of the two - higgs - doublet sector , allowing for flavor - dependent fermion masses and family mixings ; @xmath219 an extended higgs sector with more than two doublets generating ewsb , which is possible in @xmath4 theories@xcite ; @xmath220 oblique corrections from relatively light sfermions ( and mirror sfermions ) and majorana fermions such as gauginos , higgsinos , and their mirrors ; and @xmath221 the considerations of @xmath222 mixing in extra @xmath223 models@xcite .",
    "each of these extensions can affect , in principle , the constraints on @xmath117 , the two - higgs - doublet spectrum , and their correlations .",
    "however , these are highly model - dependent avenues which are left for future works . in addition , our study may be further extended for a six parameter analysis including @xmath224 @xcite together , which may be relevant for the region of @xmath225 .",
    "it is our pleasure to thank jens erler for various discussions on precision data and for his comments on the manuscript .",
