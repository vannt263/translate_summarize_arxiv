    "@xmath9 is defined as the symmetric displacement gradient @xmath12 and , assuming that the material is not subjected to volumic couple , the associated stress tensor is the classical symmetric cauchy s one .",
    "hence , both @xmath8 and @xmath9 belong to the @xmath13-d vector space @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the symmetric tensor product . as a consequence",

    "therefore the elasticity tensor is the second - derivative of the potential energy with respect to strain tensor .",
    "thus , as a consequence of schwarz s theorem , the hyperelasticity tensor possesses the _ major symmetry _ : @xmath17 the space of elasticity tensors is therefore the @xmath18-d vector space @xmath19 . to each hyperelastic material corresponds an elasticity tensor @xmath11 but this association is not unique , there is a _",
    "gauge group_. indeed , a designation based on the components of @xmath11 in a fixed reference frame is relative to the choice of a _ fixed orientation _ of the material . if this problem is invisible for isotropic materials , it becomes more prominent as the anisotropy increases . for a fully anisotropic ( triclinic ) material how",
    "can it be decided whether two sets of components represent the same material ? to address this problem some approaches have been proposed in the literature so far .",
    "roughly speaking , those propositions are based on the computation of the elasticity tensor spectral decomposition . but",
    "despite of being theoretically well - founded , the symmetry class identification relies on the evaluation of the roots multiplicity of the characteristic polynomial .",
    "such a problem is known to be highly ill - posed @xcite .",
    "therefore this approach is difficult to handle in practice especially working with noise corrupted data .    in order to avoid the computation of the spectral decomposition an alternative approach based on the _ invariants _ ( and _ covariants _ ) of the elasticity tensor",

    "therefore , according to the hypothesis @xmath490 , and as @xmath476 is covariant to @xmath242 the intersection reduces to @xmath491 .",
