    "presently , we notice enormous world - wide experimental and theoretical efforts to determine the partial wave structure of photon - induced meson production reactions unambiguously . this has become possible by combining high - intensity beams and polarized nucleon targets with hermetic detector systems , a technology which has been available since a few years at elsa , jlab , and mami @xcite . a unique solution for partial wave amplitudes",
    "is a prerequisite to understand the photoexcitation of baryon resonances and their decay into @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath4 final states .",
    "important complementary information to these efforts is added by the study of photoproduction of meson pairs like @xmath5 or @xmath6 , which allow us to study resonances which have no significant branching ratio of the decay into the nucleon ground state . since the first precise measurements of the @xmath7 reaction in refs.@xcite the database has been growing significantly @xcite and different models are used in refs.@xcite to interpret the existing data .",
    "some common results of different model approaches may be summarized as follows .",
    "firstly , the partial wave with quantum numbers @xmath8 provides the major fraction of the cross section .",
    "it is saturated to a great extent by the @xmath9 resonance and perhaps by the @xmath10 as predicted in ref.@xcite .",
    "the decay of these baryons into @xmath11 and finally to @xmath12 results in the production of @xmath13-wave @xmath14 mesons .",
    "this is confirmed by the observed distribution of the polar angle @xmath15 in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame which is almost isotropic in the whole energy region considered",
    ". a possible contribution of the @xmath16-wave to the decay mode @xmath17 is small ( about 0.1@xmath18 ) at the resonance position @xmath19 mev and remains limited with increasing energy",
    ". the helicity couplings @xmath20 for the transitions @xmath21 with total helicities @xmath22 and @xmath23 are rather close to each other . according to @xcite their ratio varies within a narrow region between 0.95 and 1.3 .",
    "the role of other resonances , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , as well as @xmath27 , is not significant .",
    "they become visible in the angular distribution mostly due to an interference with the dominant @xmath28 partial wave . in particular , because of the positive parity , their admixture results in a visible forward - backward asymmetry in the @xmath15 distribution . furthermore",
    ", the contribution of these resonances is important in order to describe the observed circular photon asymmetries @xcite .",
    "since the primary goal in the investigation of photoproduction of two pseudoscalars is the search for nucleon resonances with appreciable two - meson decay modes , special interest is focused on the partial wave content of these reactions . in such a situation , model independent analysis of the experiments with polarized particles",
    "is of special use . at the same time , the existing approaches have some weak points which hinder their effective use as a formal basis for a theoretical analysis of the data .",
    "firstly , the typical formalism is inherently based on the isobar model , where it is assumed that the transition to the final @xmath29 state proceeds via intermediate decay of the @xmath13-channel resonances into the quasi - two - body states , containing meson - nucleon isobars , @xmath30 or @xmath31 . in other words , this approach depend on our assumptions about the production mechanism , so that the corresponding results are to some extent always model dependent . secondly , in contrast to single - meson photoproduction , the conventional scheme for partial wave expansion of the final @xmath29 state does not provide multipole representation amenable for practical applications .",
    "indeed , when there are more than two particles in the final state , angular dependence of the cross section is governed not only by the total angular momentum , but also by the quantum numbers related to the two - body subsystems .",
    "this makes relation between the spin - parity of the decaying resonance and the corresponding angular distributions of the final particles very elaborate and much less transparent in comparison to single meson photoproduction .    in the present paper",
    "we would like to demonstrate an alternative method , which is free from the assumption about dynamics of the resonance decays .",
    "the method has already been used successfully to analyse photoproduction of two neutral pions in ref.@xcite .",
    "the general formalism is described in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "contrary to the usual scheme , where the quantization axis is taken along the initial beam direction we take it along the normal to the plane spanned by the moments of the final three particles in the overall center - of - mass frame .",
    "the resulting partial wave expansion of the amplitude is based only on the principles of rotation and inversion invariance and is therefore completely general .",
    "since only the unpolarized cross section is considered , we do not try to get detailed information about the contributing partial waves .",
    "our main object is the moments of angular distribution of the initial photon beam .",
    "representation of the angular distribution in terms of the moments may be viewed as an analog to the expansion of the single - meson photoproduction cross section in terms of legendre polynomials . in the latter case",
    "the characteristic energy dependence of the expansion coefficients allows one to gain insight into the partial wave content of the amplitude . in a similar manner in the present paper",
    "we study the partial wave structure of the reaction @xmath32 and compare our results with those obtained in earlier studies .",
    "the experimental data for this reaction were obtained recently at the mainz microtron mami c. the experiment was performed using the glasgow - mainz tagger photon facility and the crystal ball / taps spectrometer with a liquid - hydrogen target located in the center of the crystal ball .",
    "the tagged photon beam covered the energy range from the reaction threshold to 1450 mev with an energy bin about 4 mev .",
    "the spectrometer is a hermetic system of @xmath33 and @xmath34 crystals covering @xmath35 of the full solid angle . for charged - particle identification a barrel of 24 scintillation counters surrounding the target",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath14 mesons were identified via their decay into two photons following @xmath37 minimization applied to all possible two - photon combinations .",
    "parameters of the proton also were measured if it was detectable .",
    "the background , which mainly comes from the @xmath38 reaction , was subtracted by fitting the missing - mass distributions for the proton .",
    "the systematic uncertainty was estimated to be 5% and includes uncertainties in the photon flux , target density and detection efficiency . the experimental setup and the event selection procedure",
    "are described in detail in ref.@xcite .    for the analysis the overall center - of - mass system was used .",
    "the coordinate system is schematically presented in fig.[fig1 ] . as independent kinematical variables we use the meson energies @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the solid angle @xmath41 fixing the orientation of the initial photon beam with respect to the plane spanned by the final state particles .",
    "the third angle @xmath42 corresponds to rotation around the normal .",
    "it only influences the cross section in case of linearly polarized particles .    for the @xmath43-matrix",
    "the following expression expanding it over the partial wave amplitudes was derived in @xcite @xmath44 here @xmath45 are the wigner functions which are matrix elements corresponding to @xmath46 representation of the rotation group .",
    "for simplicity , the angle @xmath42 determining rotation around the normal is taken as zero .",
    "the partial wave amplitudes @xmath47 depend on the initial total helicity @xmath48 and and the final nucleon helicity @xmath49 , the total angular momentum @xmath50 , its projection @xmath51 on the chosen @xmath52 axis as well as the total c.m .",
    "energy @xmath53 and the meson energies @xmath54 , @xmath55 .    as in the case of single meson production ,",
    "a unique determination of the amplitudes requires much more experimental information about spin - observables than presently is available .",
    "however , using high precision data on the distributions of the normalized cross sections over the angles @xmath56 and @xmath57 , it is possible to extract the moments @xmath58 of an expansion in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "these moments are bilinear combinations of the partial wave amplitudes @xmath61 and their measurements put valuable constraints on the partial wave structure of the full amplitude .",
    "the corresponding expression was derived in ref.@xcite : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an appropriate phase space factor and @xmath64 are the clebsch - gordan coefficients for the coupling @xmath65 .",
    "as noted in @xcite the moments @xmath58 obey the following symmetry properties .",
    "firstly , parity conservation leads to the relation @xmath66 meaning that the moments with @xmath67 odd vanish exactly . secondly , since @xmath68 in eq.([wthetphi ] ) is a real quantity one has @xmath69 leading also to @xmath70 .",
    "as follows from ( [ wconj ] ) , it is sufficient to consider only the moments with @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , waves of the same ( opposite ) parity can interfere only for @xmath58 with @xmath72even ( odd ) . as may readily be seen from eq.([wlm ] ) , partial waves of the maximum total angular momentum @xmath50 can contribute only to the moments up to @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the amplitudes with @xmath74 contribute only to @xmath75 through @xmath76 . using the above properties , a direct determination of the moments @xmath58 from the experimental data yields valuable information on the states of total angular momentum that are present in the cross section .",
    "the results for @xmath58 are presented in fig.[fig2 ] as a function of the total c.m .",
    "the moments were obtained from the measured two - dimensional distributions @xmath77 using the definition ( [ wthetphi ] ) as @xmath78 the analysis of the results shows that our general notions about the major mechanisms of the @xmath0 reaction based on the previous analyses @xcite seem to be correct .",
    "firstly , in the region around @xmath19 mev , because of the closeness of the helicity amplitudes @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the resonance @xmath9 the moment @xmath81 turns out to be small .",
    "this result can easily be explained if one takes into account in the amplitude @xmath82 only the contribution of the resonance @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , from the general formula ( [ wlm ] ) one obtains for @xmath83 , @xmath84",
    "@xmath85 if only one resonance contributes , the partial wave amplitude @xmath82 can be presented in the factorized form @xmath86 where the vertex function @xmath87 , @xmath88 , determines electromagnetic transition @xmath89 with a definite total helicity @xmath48 of the @xmath90 state .",
    "it is equal to the corresponding helicity amplitude @xmath91 at the resonance position @xmath92 .",
    "the functions @xmath93 which are independent of @xmath48 describe propagation and decay of @xmath9 into @xmath94 .",
    "then for each value of the @xmath52-projection @xmath51 , the integrand in eq.([w20 ] ) is proportional to the difference @xmath95 and , therefore , vanishes in the limit @xmath96 . at the same time , the moment @xmath75 , which is sensitive to the interference between @xmath28 and the positive parity states @xmath97 and @xmath28 is essential .",
    "furthermore , the moments with @xmath98 appearing due to a possible admixture of the states with higher values of @xmath50 ( e.g. , @xmath99 ) are expected to be small .    as we can see in fig.[fig2 ] , the measurements confirm the general smallness of the moment @xmath81 in the region of @xmath9 .",
    "the relatively large value of @xmath75 is also in rather well agreement with our assumption about importance of partial wave amplitudes with positive parity in @xmath100 photoproduction . according to the results of refs.@xcite",
    "these partial waves are saturated by the resonances @xmath25 and @xmath27 with a moderate contribution coming from @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and from non - resonant background .",
    "the insignificance of the moments with @xmath101 shows that a large contribution of the wave @xmath102 is unlikely .",
    "the moments with @xmath103 are also relatively small .",
    "we conclude that there is little evidence for strong contributions of the waves with total angular momentum @xmath104 .",
    "in particular the waves @xmath105 and @xmath99 seem not to be important . as an example of a theoretical description we present in fig.[fig2 ] the predictions of the model @xcite ( solid lines ) , which are in general agreement with the data .",
    "we analyzed the moments for the @xmath0 reaction using a model independent expansion of angular distributions of the initial photons in a specific coordinate system .",
    "this allowed us to formulate model independent constraints on the partial wave structure of the production amplitude .",
    "generally , the data confirm the main features of the existing model predictions @xcite for the dynamical structure of @xmath100 photoproduction on a proton .",
    "they demonstrate the dominance of the wave @xmath28 , which is expected to come from the resonance @xmath9 and probably from @xmath10 as well as the existence of a small admixture of the resonance states with positive parity . for the higher waves @xmath105 and @xmath99 no statistically significant evidences were found .",
