    "in this paper we will address an indispensable question related with the aforementioned kink  @xcite : can we obtain a static kink solution without singularity , which reproduces properly its singular limit ? in the pure tachyonic theory of born - infeld type effective action with a runaway potential , the unique static regular solution is periodic array of tachyon kink - anitkinks . in the limit of vanishing pressure",

    "this action is actually exactly the same as that of rolling tachyon which is given by @xmath216^{2 } } , \\label{2bb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath217 thus , there exists a one - to - one correspondence between a kink solution with spatial distribution and the time evolution of a homogeneous rolling tachyon solution . with this identification",
    ", the pressure @xmath36 , in our system corresponds to the hamiltonian density @xmath218 , in the rolling tachyon system .",
    "now we describe the solutions in detail when @xmath178 .",

    "[ fig7][fig9 ] ) , static constant vacuum solution is allowed at @xmath221 .",
    "since the tachyon potential vanishes for @xmath210 , the localized terms in @xmath53 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 are all zero .",
    "\\(ii ) when the energy @xmath212 is larger than zero but smaller than the top of tachyon potential ( i.e. , @xmath224 ; see the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , there is a turning point @xmath225 such that @xmath226 , configuration is convex up ( or convex down ) so we will call this solution a tachyon bounce",

    "( [ 2uu ] ) and ( [ 2zt ] ) , respectively .",
    "its asymptotic slopes are @xmath228 which are shown by the two solid straight lines in fig .",
    "note that , since @xmath178 , the localized parts of @xmath53 , @xmath222 , and @xmath229 all flip their signs .",
    "for example , the energy density has positive constant term and a negative localized contribution near the origin ( see the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) @xmath230 also it means that the transverse component of pressure @xmath137 is positive and the string charge density @xmath151 is negative .",
    "\\(iii ) when the `` energy '' @xmath212 is the same as the maximum of the `` potential '' @xmath231 , ( @xmath232 ; see the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , we obtain the trivial vacuum ontop solution @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , there is also the tachyon `` half - kink '' ( or `` half - antikink '' ) solution which connects the unstable symmetric vacuum @xmath233 and a stable broken vacuum @xmath234 ( see the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) , @xmath235.\\ ] ] since the half - kink connects two vacua with different vacuum energy as @xmath236 , the energy density is monotonically increasing ( see the dashed curve in fig .  [ fig9 ] ) , @xmath237 the transverse component of pressure @xmath137 and the string charge density @xmath151 are also monotonic .",
    "\\(iv ) if @xmath238 , ( @xmath239 , see the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , we have @xmath240.\\ ] ] configuration is monotonically increasing ( or decreasing ) from @xmath241 to @xmath234 ( see also the dotted curve in fig .  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "opposite to the similar kink solutions in the previous section , slope of the solutions has minimum value at the origin , and maximum at infinity .",
    "this solution can be considered as two half - kink solutions joined at the origin .",
    "the energy density of this solution is given by @xmath242 it is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] with the dotted line .",
    "in this paper , static solutions have been investigated in born - infeld type tachyonic effective action with and without electromagnetic fields .",
    "in pure tachyonic theory , we have shown that the periodic array of tachyon kink - antikinks is the unique static regular solution . in the limit of vanishing pressure along the array ,",
    "the solution becomes an array of step functions with an infinite gap .",
    "the values of tension of single unit kink ( or antikink ) @xmath243 and period remain constant irrespective of the value of pressure .    when the electrostatic field orthogonal to the tachyon soliton is turned on in an unstable d2-brane , a periodic array , and regular topological tachyon kinks",
    "are obtained , classified by the value of electric field with fixed conjugate momentum . for a given electric field ,",
    "taking limit of vanishing conjugate momentum leads to singular limit where both energy density and transverse component of pressure are given by sum of @xmath6-functions or a @xmath6-function .",
    "when the electric field is smaller than or equal to critical value , tension is @xmath243 . when the electric field is larger than the critical value , a multiplicative factor depending on the value of electric field appears .",
    "for the general case with both electric and magnetic fields , spectra of solutions are specified by four parameters , three components of electromagnetic fields and one pressure component along the soliton , and divided into two classes by transverse component of electric field . when it is smaller than critical value , the spectra of solitons are exactly the same as the cases of pure electric field , i.e. , they are periodic array of tachyon kink - antikinks and topological tachyon kinks . minor difference appears in the constant scales and the tension .",
    "major difference is that they carry confined component of f1 charge density so that each kink is presumably a d1f1 .",
    "when the transverse component of electric field is larger than critical value , we additionally found half - kink connecting unstable and stable vacua , tachyon bounce , and topological tachyon kink .",
    "the topological tachyon kink at the critical value of the electric field orthogonal to the tachyon soliton seems to be a bps object , but it should be addressed in future works by obtaining its worldvolume action and checking existing supersymmetry as has been done in ref .  @xcite .",
