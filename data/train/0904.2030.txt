    "observations with the spectropolarimeter of the solar optical telescope ( sot ) onboard the hinode space observatory @xcite indicate that seen with a spatial resolution of 0.3 , quiet internetwork regions harbor a photospheric magnetic field whose mean field strength of its horizontal component considerably surpasses that of the vertical component @xcite . according to these papers",
    ", the vertical fields are concentrated in the intergranular lanes , whereas the stronger , horizontal fields occur most commonly at the edges of the bright granules , aside from the vertical fields .",
    "@xcite find from recordings with gong and solis a ` seething magnetic field ' with a line - of - sight component increasing from disk center to limb as expected for a nearly horizontal field orientation .",
    "@xcite detected transient horizontal magnetic fields in plage regions as well .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite reported observations of weak and strong horizontal fields in quiet sun regions .    regarding numerical simulations , @xcite ,",
    "note `` we find in all simulations also strong horizontal fields above convective upflows '' , and @xcite find frequent horizontal fields in their three - dimensional simulations , which they describe as `` small - scale canopies '' .",
    "also the 3-d simulations of @xcite display `` horizontally directed ribbons of magnetic flux that permeate the model chromosphere '' , not unlike the figures shown by @xcite .",
    "@xcite find in a three - dimensional surface - dynamo simulation `` a clear dominance of the horizontal field in the height range where the spectral lines used for the hinode observations are formed '' .",
    "@xcite report on results from three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of the internetwork magnetic field with regard to the intrinsically produced horizontal magnetic field .",
    "they compute the polarimetric signal of this field and compare it to measurements with hinode . in the following ,",
    "we briefly summarize part of their results and present new calculations of the center - to - limb variation of the linear and circular polarization from these simulations .",
    "we have carried out three sets of numerical simulations , run v10 , run h20 , and run h50 , which significantly differ in their initial and boundary conditions for the magnetic field .",
    "run v10 starts with a homogeneous vertical field of 10  g strength , which is kept vertical at the top and bottom boundary",
    ". these conditions might actually be more appropriate for network magnetic fields because of the preference for one polarity and the vertical direction .",
    "run h20 and run h50 start without a magnetic field but upwellings that enter the simulation domain across the bottom boundary area carry horizontal magnetic field of a uniform strength of 20  g and 50  g , respectively , into the box .",
    "the three - dimensional computational domain extends from 1400 km below the mean surface of optical depth @xmath0 to 1400 km above it , high enough that the top boundary condition should not unduly tamper the formation layers of the spectral lines that are used in polarimetric measurements with hinode .",

    "the mean horizontal field strength is larger than the mean strength of the vertical component throughout the photosphere and the lower chromosphere : in run v10 this is the case in the height range between 250  km and 850  km .",
    "both runs show a local maximum in the horizontal field strength close to the classical temperature minimum at a height of around 500  km . at a given continuum",
    "optical depth in the photosphere the area occupied by fields with a horizontal component stronger than a given threshold of a few gauss is typically three times larger than the area with a vertical component exceeding this limit .    for a comparison with zeeman measurements from the hinode spectropolarimeter we synthesized the stokes profiles of both 630  nm spectral lines of the two simulation runs .",
    "profiles were computed with the radiative transfer code sir  @xcite with a spectral sampling of 2 pm . when applying an appropriate point spread function , psf , @xcite to the synthetic profiles and subjecting them to the same procedure for conversion to apparent flux densities as done by @xcite for the observed profiles , we obtain spatial and temporal averages for the transversal and longitudinal apparent magnetic flux densities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 of respectively 21.5  mx@xmath3 and 5.0  mx@xmath3 for run h20 and 10.4  mx@xmath3 and 6.6  mx@xmath3 for run v10 .",

    "the clv of @xmath10 and @xmath9 substantially differ between v10 and h50 , which indicates that they sensitively depend on the precise height variation of the horizontal and the vertical component of the magnetic field . since the vertical component of v10 dominates over the horizontal one in the low photosphere ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the mean longitudinal ( line - of - sight ) field component decreases when moving away from disk center and only when approaching the limb it increases again due to the sharp increase of the horizontal component above @xmath11  km .",
