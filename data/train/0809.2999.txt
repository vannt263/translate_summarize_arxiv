    "hence , accretion is not shut off at @xmath58 , and there is no sharp transition in its behaviour at this redshift .",

    "= 3.5truein    looking first at central galaxies , there is a clear trend for higher mass galaxies to assemble at higher redshifts .",
    "for example , the redshift at which 50% of the final galaxy mass has been accreted by the central galaxy population ( @xmath66=0.5 in figure [ fig : sub3 ] ) falls from @xmath67 for @xmath68m@xmath11 - 10@xmath69m@xmath11 to @xmath70 for @xmath71m@xmath11 - 10@xmath72m@xmath11 , with a steady trend in between these masses .",
    "this downward shift of assembly redshifts is consistent with the well known `` downsizing '' trend of observed galaxy evolution .",
    "it arises naturally : massive galaxies reside in dense environments with accelerated early formation @xcite .",
    "however , even the most massive galaxies have a significant fraction of mass accreted at low redshift , which is inconsistent with the observed red colours of the most massive galaxies .",
    "low mass satellite galaxies accrete most of their mass early on and experience little accretion at late times , with @xmath66=0.5 at @xmath73 compared to @xmath74 for low mass centrals .",
    "there is a strong trend with halo mass : low mass satellites in the most massive halo assemble earlier and have accreted 90% of their final mass by @xmath75 , while the satellites in @xmath76m@xmath11 haloes have slightly lower assembly redshifts than comparable central galaxies .",
    "the same trends are seen for higher galaxy masses , but the differences between central and satellite galaxies are smaller",
    ". for high galaxy masses ( panels c and d ) , there are no satellites in low mass haloes .    with our star formation prescription , which results in an increasing star formation rate with increasing gas density",
    ", star formation closely tracks the accretion of gas with a time lag ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we find similar trends for star formation as we did for gas accretion : satellite galaxies typically form their stars earlier than central galaxies , but the difference is smaller at higher galaxy masses . among satellites ,",
    "those in high mass haloes typically form stars early on and have little star formation at late times , while satellites in low mass haloes continue to form stars at low redshifts .",
    "to further investigate the physical processes involved in gas accretion by satellites , we differentiate between hot and cold accretion @xcite .",
    "there are two reasons that it is interesting to isolate the contribution of cold accretion to galaxy growth .",
    "first , tests by @xcite and @xcite show that the rate of hot gas accretion in hydrodynamic cosmological simulations is sensitive to differences among simulation codes but the cold accretion rates are robust .",
    "in particular , hot accretion rates are lower in simulations with gadget @xcite than in simulations with the ptreesph code used here , probably because the former employs an entropy conserving formulation of sph .",
    "second , agn feedback , which is not incorporated in our simulation , could be more effective at suppressing hot accretion flows , since they have low - densities and are quasi - spherical compared to cold accretion flows , which channel dense gas along filaments @xcite . thus ,",
    "for either numerical or physical reasons , the cold accretion rate in our simulation might be a better approximation to a galaxy s true total accretion rate .",
    "= 3.5truein    figure [ fig : sub5 ] shows the fraction of @xmath5 galaxy mass that was originally acquired ( by the galaxy or its progenitors ) via cold accretion .",
    "in agreement with @xcite , we find that low mass galaxies gain their mass almost entirely from cold accretion , while the highest mass galaxies gain up to  2/3 of their final mass by hot accretion .",
    "( this latter behaviour is different in the gadget-2 simulations of @xcite[@xcite ] , but the former remains true ; see their figure 10 . )",
    "figure [ fig : sub5 ] shows that the trend with galaxy mass is nearly identical for central and satellite galaxies , and that among satellite galaxies there is no dependence of the cold accretion fraction on halo mass . if hot accretion were completely suppressed in the real universe ( or in numerical simulations with a different treatment of gas physics or feedback ) , then to a first approximation the @xmath5 galaxy masses would be reduced , on average , by the factor shown in figure [ fig : sub5 ] .",
    "figure [ fig : sub3a ] repeats the assembly history analysis of figure [ fig : sub3 ] , but we now eliminate all material gained originally through hot accretion ( onto the galaxy or any of its progenitors ) before computing galaxy masses at any redshift .",
    "all of the trends seen in figure [ fig : sub3 ] are still apparent : assembly shifts towards higher redshifts for higher galaxy masses , satellite galaxies assemble earlier than central galaxies of the same mass , and satellites in massive haloes assemble earlier than satellites in low mass haloes .",
    "however , the trend of assembly history with galaxy mass is much stronger ( for centrals and satellites ) because galaxies experience little cold accretion once their mass exceeds @xmath77m@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "galaxies above @xmath78m@xmath11 have typically accreted 90% of their final mass by @xmath73 .",

    "since we do not resolve galaxies below @xmath98m@xmath11 , we restrict our merger analysis to systems in which the primary galaxy is more massive than @xmath99 and the merger mass ratio is @xmath100 . as we go to higher redshifts , the galaxy masses decrease , causing the number of resolved mergers to decrease . hence , we restrict our merger analysis to mergers between @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : mergers2 ] shows @xmath101 for all merger events between @xmath2 and @xmath5 as a function of the @xmath5 baryonic mass of the galaxy , differentiating between the central / satellite status of the primary galaxy at @xmath102 ( the epoch of the merger ) and at @xmath5 .",
    "we see mergers with a wide range of mass ratios for satellites as well as centrals .",
    "a small fraction of mergers ( @xmath9110% ) are between objects of similar mass ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "more than four - fifths of merger events involve a satellite galaxy merging with the central galaxy of its parent halo .",
    "about one - third of these galaxies go on to become satellites by @xmath5 , following a merger of their parent halo with a halo hosting a more massive galaxy .",
    "however , it is notable that close to one - fifth of the merger events in our simulation are mergers between two satellite galaxies .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mergers2 ] compares the fraction of central and satellite galaxies that receive mergers between @xmath2 and @xmath5 above a certain merger ratio , @xmath101 .",
    "one - fourth of the galaxies in the simulation ( above @xmath104 ) experience at least one merger with r@xmath105 between @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "this fraction is similar for central galaxies and for @xmath5 satellites and the @xmath101 distribution is also similar , as one can see by comparing the solid and dashed lines .",
    "however , the fraction of satellites that receive mergers after @xmath60 is a factor of 2 - 3 lower ( dotted line ) .",
    "galaxies that receive mergers often receive more than one merger , so the accounting in the top and bottom panels is somewhat different .",
    "figure [ fig : mergers2 ] adopts the somewhat arbitrary redshift interval @xmath2 to @xmath5 , and the mass distributions of the central and satellite galaxies are systematically different . to fairly compare the merger activity of central galaxies and post-@xmath60 satellites , we return to the control sample used for our accretion comparisons .",
    "the top panel of figure [ fig : mergers1 ] shows the merger ratio for mergers ( no longer restricted to @xmath106 ) with @xmath107 received by satellite galaxies and by the control sample of central galaxies after @xmath60 of the matched satellite .",
    "only 14% of satellite galaxies and 16% of central galaxies in the control sample receive mergers after @xmath60 .",
    "the distribution of mass ratios is broad for both populations .",
    "our sample is not large enough to study the merger properties of satellite galaxies as a function of halo mass .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : mergers1 ] shows the fraction of central and satellite galaxies that receive a merger above a given @xmath101 after @xmath60 ( in contrast to figure [ fig : mergers2 ] , which shows all mergers since @xmath2 and includes all central galaxies ) .",
    "the probability of a satellite galaxy receiving a merger above a certain mass ratio is only @xmath912% lower than that of a central galaxy of similar mass , across a wide range of merger mass ratios .",
    "the central galaxies of haloes form a distinct population in this simulation , as anticipated by semi - analytic models @xcite and as found in previous numerical studies @xcite . in the great majority of fof haloes ,",
    "the most massive galaxy lies at the bottom of the dark matter potential well and close to the centre of mass . in more than two - thirds of the fof haloes ,",
    "the baryonic mass ( stars + cold gas ) of the central galaxy is 2 - 5 times higher than that of the most massive satellite . only a small fraction of fof haloes host two galaxies of similar mass .",
    "because of its limited volume , our simulation has only one cluster mass halo ( @xmath108 @xmath91 @xmath109 ) .",
    "the other haloes massive enough to host resolved satellites range from @xmath110 to @xmath111 , while haloes down to @xmath112 host resolved central galaxies .",
    "the distinction between central and satellite galaxies in our simulation is weaker than expected in a simple picture where only central galaxies accrete mass and `` receive '' mergers of less massive systems .",
    "galaxies that are satellites at @xmath5 assembled their mass earlier , on average , than present day central galaxies of the same baryonic mass , and satellites of more massive haloes have systematically higher assembly redshifts .",
    "however , to a large extent the baryonic mass of a galaxy is a better predictor of its accretion and merger history than its central or satellite status , with the exception of galaxies in the cluster mass halo . in part ,",
    "the dominance of baryonic mass over satellite status just reflects the fact that many satellites were central galaxies for most of their history , merging into larger haloes only at low redshift .",
    "however , we find that simulated galaxies continue to accrete gas and , in some cases , merge with lower mass objects even after they become satellites .",
    "in essence , galaxies that enter the virial radius of a larger halo may remain the `` central '' galaxies of their own dark matter substructure , and they lose their central status only gradually .",
    "alternative halo definitions ( e.g. , higher threshold density or spherical overdensity identification ) could yield somewhat sharper distinctions between central and satellite galaxies , but we do not expect them to change this basic result .    while galaxies continue to accrete gas after becoming satellites , they accrete less than a `` control '' sample of central galaxies with similar baryonic masses measured over the same time period . at the time they enter a larger halo , satellites have similar accretion rates to central galaxies of the same mass , and the accretion rate declines towards zero over the next 0.5 - 1 gyr .",
    "lower mass satellites in the cluster mass halo begin to lose mass , and by @xmath5 they are typically 10 - 20% less massive than they were when they became satellites .",
    "when we compare satellite galaxies to central galaxies of the same baryonic mass , we find large systematic differences if , and only if , the mass of the satellite s host halo is much larger than the typical halo mass for the corresponding central galaxies .",
    "as in @xcite , we find that galaxies below @xmath113 accrete predominantly through `` cold mode '' , while higher mass galaxies grow mainly through `` hot mode '' accretion of virial temperature gas .",
    "this transition is similar for central and satellite galaxies .",
    "consequently , our general conclusions would still hold if we assumed that a galaxy s true accretion rate was close to its cold ( rather than total ) accretion rate , for either the physical or numerical reasons discussed in  3 , except that the accretion rates of massive galaxies would become very low . regardless of whether we consider total accretion or cold accretion only , these simulations exhibit natural `` downsizing '' in which accretion and star formation shift towards lower mass galaxies at later times @xcite .    comparing present day central galaxies and present day satellites , above a mass threshold of @xmath114 , we find that only a slightly larger fraction of centrals ( 27% vs. 22% ) have received mergers with mass ratio @xmath100 since @xmath2",
    ". roughly half of the satellite mergers occurred after the larger parent had become a satellite , and half occurred while it was still a central object .",
    "the mass ratio distributions are similar in all cases .",
    "there are more central galaxies than satellites and only about one in five resolved merger events involves two satellites .",
    "however , if we compare satellites to a control sample of centrals as we did for accretion , we find similar fractions experiencing resolved , @xmath107 mergers during the course of the simulation , with similar @xmath101 distributions . in summary , most galaxies have quiescent assembly histories at @xmath115 , and the merger rates of central and satellite galaxies are not radically different .",
    "the most massive galaxies do have more complex merger histories @xcite , and these are usually central galaxies of high mass haloes .",
    "while we have focused on mass growth rather than star formation , the two are closely linked in our simulation , with star formation generally following gas accretion after a short delay .",
    "the fact that galaxies experience continuing gas accretion for 0.5 - 1 gyr after becoming satellites means that satellites will be systematically bluer than predicted in semi - analytic models that assume no accretion onto satellites ( `` strangulation '' ) .",
    "there are numerous indications that including the continuing satellite accretion predicted here would improve the match between semi - analytic models and observations .",
    "@xcite find that the @xcite semi - analytic model predicts an excessive fraction of red satellites relative to the satellite population in groups identified from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the discrepancy is largest for lower mass groups , which have much higher blue fractions than predicted , consistent with our finding that the central - satellite distinction becomes sharper for satellites in high mass haloes .",
    "@xcite show that the pairwise velocity distributions predicted by the @xcite and @xcite models can be brought into agreement with sdss measurements by reducing the fraction of faint red galaxies .",
    "@xcite find similar trends at @xmath116 , showing that the @xcite model predicts excessive clustering of red galaxies and insufficient clustering of blue galaxies relative to the deep2 galaxy redshift survey , especially on small scales .",
    "most recently , @xcite show that the colours of sdss satellites can be reproduced if their star formation slows over a timescale of 2 - 3 gyr after @xmath60 , somewhat larger than the timescale for accretion shut off found here .",
    "other observations indicate that the colours of satellite galaxies depend systematically on halo mass , as we would expect based on the assembly redshift trends in figures 6 and 8 . in a sample of clusters taken from the red - sequence cluster survey , @xcite",
    "find that the red fraction in clusters increases with richness , indicating an earlier truncation of star formation in higher mass haloes .",
    "@xcite find a similar result using data from the sdss .",
    "finally , x - ray studies of clusters indicate that massive satellites retain local concentrations of hot gas @xcite , providing further evidence that the physical transition from `` central galaxy '' to `` satellite '' is a gradual one .",
    "further discussions of the impact of the halo environment on satellite galaxy properties , focused on the effects of ram pressure stripping , are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our small simulation volume limits our statistical power , especially for massive haloes .",
    "in addition , there are indications that the treesph code used here predicts too much hot gas accretion , and that the entropy conserving sph formulation of @xcite yields more accurate results @xcite . @xcite",
    "have recently analysed a simulation of a 50@xmath12mpc cube evolved with the entropy conserving sph code gadget-2 @xcite , with a similar mass resolution to the simulation analysed here .",
    "while they focus mainly on the relative importance of cold and hot accretion in galaxy growth , they also investigate central and satellite accretion , and confirm our main result : satellites experience significant amounts of continuing accretion , and the distinction between central and satellite growth rates is smaller at high galaxy masses and ( a point not investigated here ) at high redshift . both our simulation and the @xcite simulation overpredict the observed galaxy baryonic mass function ,",
    "probably because they do not include galactic winds that eject accreted material from low and intermediate mass galaxies .",
    "winds will change the relation between accretion rates and star formation rates , and they will affect the accretion rates themselves by altering the local gas supply . however , we do not expect them to alter our qualitative conclusions : the distinction between central and satellite galaxies is fundamental to understanding the galaxy population and its evolution , but differences in their growth rates and hence their physical properties are smooth , not sharp .",
