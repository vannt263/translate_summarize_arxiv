    "before simulating the preparation stage of the atom - light interaction , we first examine the effect of quantum interference  @xcite in the system . the two competing paths to the excited state @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    "lead to quantum interference : a well - known phenomena in the interaction of multi - state systems with coherent light , see for example the review article  @xcite .",

    "for simplicity we take the polarisation state of the pump to be fixed throughout the experiment , and thus the dressed states also remain fixed .",
    "the hamiltonian of the transformed system @xmath63 shows that the transition @xmath64 is mediated by the rabi angular - frequency @xmath65 .",
    "this tells us that the atomic state @xmath66 is associated with the polarisation state of the pump field @xmath8 ; similarly , the uncoupled state @xmath67 is associated with a field orthogonal to @xmath8 , the magnitude of which is zero in the preparation stage .",
    "we discuss the implications of this later .",
    "if we begin with an atomic ensemble in a mixed state , the initial ground state density operator in the ms transformed basis is @xmath68 , i.e.  the three possible states are evenly populated and there is no coherence amongst them .",

    "we see that they are orthogonal and are coherent superpositions of the bare - atom states @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "therefore asymmetry in the populations of the dressed states leads to an increase in the coherence of the ground - state subsystem @xmath73 .",
    "the aim of the preparation process is to create a partially coherent ground state and the efficiency of the preparation stage can be parameterised as the degree of coherence @xmath74 , which takes a value from zero ( an incoherent mixture ) to the maximum allowed value of unity ( a pure state ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : prep2d ] shows the results of pulse propagation in the preparation stage . in parts ( a)-(d ) the field envelopes are plotted .",
    "the peak of the stokes pulse enters the medium at @xmath75  ns , followed by the pump at @xmath76  ns .",
    "this pulse spacing amounts to a time separation of one @xmath77 width , which is the optimal separation for stirap using gaussian envelope functions  @xcite .",
    "the front of the stokes pulse is seen to traverse the medium at close to the speed of light without distortion , due to there initially being no population on the stokes transition .",
    "as the pump arrives , the two - photon transition can now be affected , leading to strong coupling of the stokes and pump fields to each other and to the atoms .",
    "back action on the light distorts the coupled fields as they travel deeper inside the medium .",
    "the initial field parameters were chosen based on the nave assumption that the relationship between the envelopes of the two preparation pulses remains ( relatively ) stable . unless the atom - light interaction is balanced to maintain the required conditions , the consequence of heavy field distortion is that the stirap process is likely disrupted , which is indeed what is seen in figure  [ fig : rho3d ] . here",
    "we show the coherence of the subsystem @xmath78 . in the first 2  mm the stirap process",
    "is carried out with high preparation efficiency , and after the beams have gone ( @xmath79  ns ) the coherent state is of high purity ( @xmath800.95 ) .",
    "deeper into the medium , the efficiency is steadily reduced ( ignoring the transient ` ridge ' which is influenced by pulse distortion ) . despite the limited range ,",
    "stirap fares better than preparation via resonant processes ( such as inversion via @xmath81-pulses ) .",
    "simulations show that during resonant processes the preparation fields are absorbed in the first few tens of microns inside the medium .",
    "preparation of a ground - state coherence in optically thick media has been studied previously in reference  @xcite . there , a non - degenerate lambda system was used , i.e.  the final state @xmath5 is lower in energy than state @xmath3 , in which case the stokes transition is formally a gain resonance .",
    "thus in an optically thick medium where back action on the light is significant , energy is transfered from the pump into the stokes field ; this is in contrast to the results of the cascade system seen in this paper where both pump and stokes fields are absorbed .    , at @xmath82 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath83  mm ( solid curve ) ; ( d ) shows the same information for the pump field.,width=321 ]     between the ground state sublevels @xmath71 and @xmath72 , shown versus time and displacement inside the medium.,width=321 ]",
    "after the stirap preparation stage we are left with a medium possessing a ground - state subsystem prepared to a high degree of coherence which is stable against decay ( we ignore particle - particle interactions such as collisions  @xcite which may serve to dephase the partially coherent state ) . the rest of the atomic population is found in the metastable excited state from where it will eventually filter back to the ground state , but only over a timescale longer than the duration of the experiment . to a fair degree of accuracy",
    "we can then treat the medium as if it were in a stable state . in the measurement stage",
    ", we apply a weak probing field to the medium . for",
    "a weak enough probe beam the medium is unaffected by the passage of the field , which leaves us free to assume steady - state conditions .",
    "working in the frequency domain we have a polarisation density of @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the susceptibility tensor .",
    "we can write the field and expectation value of the dipole operator as column vectors , giving the expression @xmath86 here the dipole matrix element @xmath87 is equal to the reduced dipole matrix element @xmath88 multiplied by @xmath89 , the relative coefficient of the @xmath90 transitions .",
    "note that the magnitude of @xmath89 is equal for both transitions ( due to the symmetry of the electronic wavefunction  @xcite ) .",
    "the steady - state values of the coherence terms can be derived from the bloch equations , and are found to be @xmath91 assuming that the population of the intermediate state @xmath92 . substituting these steady - state solutions of the coherence into equation  ( [ eq : chie ] )",
    ", we can express the susceptibility tensor as @xmath93 in the absence of a coherence between states @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the susceptibility tensor is diagonal and thus the field components @xmath11 and @xmath10 propagate independently of one other .",
    "however , in the presence of a coherence this is not the case and there will be interference between the two field components . the normal modes of the field , i.e.  the field polarisations that propagate independently of each other , can be found by diagonalising @xmath85 .",
    "however , we noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : prep ] that during the stirap process the polarisation state of the pump field defines the coupled dressed state @xmath66 ( and the orthogonality condition determines the uncoupled state @xmath67 ) .",
    "the fields associated with the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the normal modes of the medium .",
    "a convenient visual representation of light polarisation is the poincar sphere .",
    "points in this three - dimensional space correspond to the column vector ( here t denotes the transpose operation ) @xmath94 , the components of which are , respectively , the intensity difference between linearly polarised light in the @xmath52 and @xmath95 directions , the intensity difference between linearly polarised light at an angle @xmath96 and @xmath51  rad to the @xmath52-axis , and the intensity difference between left and right circularly polarised light .",
    "note that orthogonality is represented by antipodal points .",
    "a light field with temporally and spatially varying polarisation is generally described by a surface . the vector / surface",
    "is often normalised by the total light intensity , and for fully polarised light each point lies on a sphere of unit radius .",
    "the evolution of the polarisation vector is implicit in the maxwell - bloch equations , but to aid the interpretation of the numerical solution to theses equations , we note that the torque equation of motion provides a simple analogy of birefringence  @xcite .",
    "the equation describes the spatial evolution of the polarisation vector @xmath97 in response to the anisotropy of the medium , represented by the birefringence vector @xmath98 : @xmath99 the geometric interpretation on the poincar sphere is that @xmath98 provides the instantaneous rotation axis and rotary power for the evolution of @xmath97 .",
    "note the limitations of this simple picture , however , in that it assumes monochromatic waves in a time - independent medium with zero losses .",
    "the birefringence vector points in the direction of the preponderance of atoms in the @xmath67 state .",
    "the stokes parameters of the anisotropy vector can be related to the density matrix elements of the ground - state subsystem via the expression  @xcite @xmath100\\quad 2\\mathrm{im}\\left[\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{+-}}^{\\mathrm{st}}\\right]\\quad\\rho_{\\mathrm{--}}^{\\mathrm{st}}-\\rho_{\\mathrm{++}}^{\\mathrm{st}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{t}}.\\ ] ] note the third element in this vector which is due to an imbalance in the populations of the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this is the cause of the traditional paramagnetic faraday effect  @xcite , and is a manifestation of circular birefringence .",
    "if the populations are equal and a ground - state coherence exists , the medium will be linearly birefringent i.e.  will respond differently to two orthogonal linearly polarised field components . in the general case",
    "the medium is elliptically birefringent .",
    "we compare the results of the numerical simulation and torque equation in the next section .",
    ", as the surface on a unit sphere .",
    "the black arrow represents the initial polarisation state ( right - circularly polarised ) ; the red arrow represents the birefringence vector of the medium ; the red circle is the path the polarisation state would trace according to the torque model .",

    "[ fig : prep2d ] and  [ fig : rho3d ] , a 2  mm long medium will be used to ensure a relatively homogeneous sample for the measurement stage . in this stage",
    ", the faraday pulse interacts with the medium after the preparation fields have exited : this is to avoid further coherent field coupling .",
    "the pulse is sufficiently weak that it does not perturb the medium as it propagates . as the pulse is detuned far off resonance",
    ", it suffers little attenuation / distortion but does experience dispersion , leading to polarisation rotation  @xcite .",
    "rotation of the faraday pulse for different medium parameters is seen in figure  [ fig : poin ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : poin](a ) the medium is prepared under the same conditions as used in figure  [ fig : rho3d ] .",
    "the faraday pulse is initially right - circularly polarised , having a polarisation vector @xmath102 . as it propagates through the medium it becomes linearly polarised as it crosses the equator of the poincar sphere , before becoming left - elliptically polarised .",
    "the polarisation rotates anticlockwise around an axis in the @xmath103 direction , which is to be expected because the medium has population balanced in favor of the state @xmath67 , which is associated with the field polarised at @xmath104  rad .",
    "however , the pulse does nt rotate as a single entity , rather the variation of dispersion over its bandwidth leads to differential rotation .",
    "thus for each position inside the medium the stokes vector varies in time .",
    "this manifests itself upon the poincar sphere as the spreading out from a single point .",
    "figure  [ fig : poin](d ) shows the field on the polarisation ellipse . here",
    "the polarisation state corresponding to the peak of the pulse is shown at the entrance and exit of the medium , along with one of the normal modes of the medium ( the other mode is orthogonal to this ) .",
    "we have previously considered the regime in which the ground state is stable against dephasing mechanisms which have the tendency to lessen the degree of coherence of the atomic subsystem we are interested in .",
    "to model the effects of dephasing we now add a 27  mhz dephasing term to the master equation ( this rate is chosen so as to significantly affect the coherence during the few nanoseconds that is the duration of the simulation ) .",
    "dephasing causes the sublevel coherence to decay towards an incoherent mixture and thus the rotary power of the birefringent medium decreases with time , though the axis of rotation remains pointing in the same direction of the poincar sphere .",
    "the faraday pulse thus rotates to a lesser degree than the case where dephasing mechanisms are ignored , as seen in figure  [ fig : poin ] parts ( b ) and ( e ) .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of an energy difference between the two sublevels involved in the coherence .",
    "this simulates an applied magnetic field used in faraday rotation .",
    "the energy difference causes precession of the atomic spin , analogous to the larmor precession of magnetic moments around an applied magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy of the levels is broken to such an extent that the partially coherent state precesses at a rate of 27  mhz . by the time the faraday pulse enters the medium ,",
    "the birefringence vector has rotated to a new direction , as observed in figure  [ fig : poin](c ) and ( f ) .",
    "and the trough on the positive side is the signature of the stirap process .",
    "( c ) rotation angle @xmath105 of the faraday pulse is shown ( left axis , solid line ) , overlaid with the magnitude of the birefringence vector ( right axis , data points , the number of which has been reduced for clarity).,width=321 ]    it is well known that the overlap of the stokes and pump envelopes plays a part in the efficiency of the stirap process  @xcite . figure  [ fig : tsep](a ) shows the population transfered to the excited state versus the separation time between the peaks of the incident stokes and pump pulses . for positive @xmath106 ,",
    "the stokes pulse precedes the pump , which is the correct order for adiabatic population transfer .",
    "this can be seen from the trough in figure  [ fig : tsep](b ) , where transfer to the intermediate state is at a minimum .",
    "note that due to the pump beam being detuned off resonance , the intermediate state is only transiently populated during the preparation stage .",
    "the asymmetry is nt mirrored in figure  [ fig : tsep](a ) because by carrying out the transfer faster than the decay rate we are less harshly punished for going on an excursion to the intermediate state .",
    "figure  [ fig : tsep](c ) shows both the length of the birefringence vector @xmath98 and the rotation @xmath105 around this vector experienced by the peak of the faraday pulse .",
    "the magnitude of the birefringence vector and the rotation angle are clearly linked .",
    "we have demonstrated a theoretical method for the preparation and measurement of a coherence in the ground state of a high density atomic medium , using gigahertz bandwidth pulses . with the use of realistic parameters ,",
