    "one of the major focuses in the study of nuclear matter has recently been to understand the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter and the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy is a fundamental quantity which determines several important properties of very small entities such as the atomic nuclei as well as very large objects such as neutron stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , the behavior of nuclear symmetry energy is most uncertain among all properties of dense nuclear matter . furthermore , the symmetry energy is important for modeling nuclear matter by probing the isospin part of nuclear interactions .",
    "recent @xcite experimental studies of isospin - sensitive observables in intermediate - energy nuclear reactions involving radioactive beams have been quite useful in providing some constraints on the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy at subsaturation densities .",
    "the effects of symmetry energy and its slope on neutron star properties is an important area of study .",
    "another area of relevance in the study of asymmetric nuclear matter is the instabilities associated with possible liquid - gas phase transitions at subsaturation densities .",
    "such liquid - gas phase transition plays an important role in the description of the crust of compact star matter at densities between @xmath7 @xmath8 and saturation density ( @xmath9 @xmath8 ) . here , we would like to address these two relevant aspects in the study of asymmetric nuclear matter in a phenomenological model that we have used in our earlier work for symmetric nuclear matter .    there has been a proliferation of phenomenological models to describe infinite nuclear matter and also properties of finite nuclei .",
    "these are in fact essential steps in the development of this area of study for which realistic first - principles theoretical descriptions as well as adequate experimental or observational data are not available .",
    "variations in different phenomenological approaches stretching from the nonrelativistic to the relativistic are tried incorporating some further aspects of theoretical requirements in the model .",
    "all these models are usually set in terms of parameters that are fit to reproduce the properties of either finite nuclei @xcite or bulk nuclear matter . as a result ,",
    "most of the models behave more or less similarly as far as the equation of state is concerned around the saturation density and at zero temperature .",
    "however , when these models are used to describe nuclear matter at subsaturation densities to explain the liquid - gas phase transition or at high densities to explain neutron star matter , they yield very different results .",
    "therefore , it has been seen as essential to incorporate some constraints related to symmetry energy and its derivatives by using up - to - date theoretical and experimental information .",
    "most of the relativistic - mean - field ( rmf ) models are attempts in these directions . however , in these models nucleons are treated as structureless point objects . therefore , as a next step in the requirement of incorporating the quark structure of the nucleon with meson couplings at the basic level ; quark - meson - coupling ( qmc ) models have been proposed @xcite and properties of nuclear matter have been studied in great detail in a series of works @xcite . in these models nucleons are described as a system of nonoverlapping mit bags which interact through effective scalar and vector meson exchanges at the quark level . however , it has been argued that the hadronic structure described by the mit - bag model suffers from some theoretical inadequacy due to the sharp bag boundary in breaking chiral symmetry , which is a good symmetry of strong interactions within the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) limit .",
    "therefore , more sophisticated versions such as the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) have been proposed for the study of hadronic structure .",
    "so , to further include this aspect of the physics requirement , it would be more appropriate to develop a quark - meson coupling model where nucleon structure is described by models like the cbm instead of by mit bags . as an alternative approach @xcite to the cbm ,",
    "the relativistic independent quark model with a phenomenologically averaged confining potential in equally mixed scalar - vector harmonic form in the dirac frame work has been used extensively with remarkable consistency in the baryonic as well as the mesonic sector @xcite .",
    "this model has provided a very suitable alternative to the otherwise successful cloudy bag model in describing hadronic structure with its static properties and various decay properties .",
    "we therefore proposed in our earlier work @xcite a modified quark - meson coupling model ( mqmc ) , which is based on a suitable confining relativistic independent quark potential rather than a bag to address the nucleon structure in vacuum as an alternative approach to qmc for the study of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this attempt was not so much as to plead superiority of mqmc over qmc at this level .",
    "it has only incorporated an essential aspect of the physics requirement missing in mit - bag model to stand as an alternative to the more appropriate cbm .",
    "further investigations are necessary to check its consistency and its predictability for any new physical features . in the mqmc model , we have studied the bulk nuclear properties such as the compressibility , the structure of eos , and also discussed some implications of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter along with the nucleon and nuclear @xmath10 term and the sensitivity of nuclear matter binding energy with variations in the light quark mass .",
    "the results obtained in such a picture for symmetric nuclear matter were quite encouraging . in the present attempt",
    ", we study the bulk properties of asymmetric nuclear matter and also the low - density instabilities of the system in such a model . to treat the asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", we incorporate in our model the contribution of the isovector vector meson @xmath2 in addition to those of the isoscalar scalar meson @xmath11 and isoscalar vector meson@xmath12 considered earlier for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite .",

    "neutron stars are compact objects maintained by the equilibrium of gravity and the degenerecy pressure of the fermions together with a strong nuclear repulsion force due to the high density reached in their interior .",
    "the slope of the symmetry energy , @xmath4 , constrains the neutron star radii .",
    "it is confirmed that the radii for the neutron stars with canonical mass @xmath198 are not affected by the symmetry energy at saturation density @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases the radii increase with @xmath4 , while in others , there is a decrease .",
    "in fact the radii are correlated with a variation of the slope @xmath4 .",
    "the radii increase up to a maximum value , then drop again .",
    "this behavior can be associated with a maximum theoretical value of @xmath4 , and provide a possible constraint to nuclear matter . in the present model the value of @xmath199 comes out to be @xmath200 mev which is very close to the experimental observation @xcite . the most direct connection between the astrophysical observations and the nuclear symmetry energy concerns neutron star radii ( @xmath201 ) which are highly correlated with neutron star pressures near @xmath92 .",
    "it is to be noted that lattimer and prakash @xcite found the radii of neutron stars for masses near the canonical mass @xmath198 , obey a power - law relation : @xmath202 where @xmath203 is the radius of a star , @xmath204 is the pressure of neutron star matter at density @xmath2 , and @xmath205 is a constant for a given density and mass . considering the structure of a neutron star as pure neutron matter , the value of this constant at quark mass @xmath106 mev in our model comes out to be @xmath206 which is very near to @xmath207 km predicted by lattimer _",
    "it is to be noted that the mass of the neutron star for @xmath208 matter with @xmath6 equilibrium comes out to be 2.7 @xmath209 with quark mass @xmath106 mev and 1.64 @xmath209 with quark mass @xmath107 mev .",
    "the details of such calculations incorporating the hyperons in the composition of neutron stars is in progress .",
    "in the present work we have studied the eos for asymmetric nuclear matter by using a modified quark - meson coupling model ( mqmc ) .",
    "self - consistent calculations were made by using a relativistic quark model with chiral symmetry along with the spurious center - of - mass correction , pionic correction for restoration of chiral symmetry , and short - distance correction for one - gluon exchange to realize different bulk nuclear properties .",
    "the instability in the two - component nuclear system is then analyzed . in asymmetric matter",
    "the isoscalar and isovector modes are coupled and the two separate inequalities for density oscillations and concentration oscillations no longer maintain a physical meaning for the selection of the nature of the instabilities .",
    "the symmetry energy , its slope @xmath210 , and curvature parameter @xmath211 were found in reasonable agreement with experimental values . without considering self interactions in the scalar field",
    ", we found an analytic expression for the symmetry energy @xmath3 as a function of its slope @xmath4 .",
    "our result establishes a linear correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "we also study the variation of correlation function @xmath113 with the variation of quark masses . the symmetry energy is correlated with neutron star radii . in this model",
    "we observe that , at twice the saturation density @xmath212 , the constant @xmath213 is found 5.90 km in the canonical - mass region of @xmath198 .",
