    "this kink manifests itself as a change of slope .",
    "intriguingly , in _ all _ crystals that exhibit metallic behaviour down to low @xmath8 ( i.e. those with low residual resistivities , including @xmath69 ) , @xmath11 appears unaffected by the pr ordering .",
    "several mechanisms for the low @xmath8 insulating behaviour , including variable range hopping  @xcite , kondo spin scattering  @xcite , the charge kondo effect  @xcite , the ln(1/@xmath8 ) dependence observed in underdoped 2d cuprates  @xcite and the exponential behaviour expected for a mott insulator  @xcite , were considered but found to be incompatible with @xmath6(@xmath8 ) , both above and below @xmath76 .",
    "whilst fe concentrations below 100ppm can give rise to resistivity upturns  @xcite , we note here that the in - chain magnetoresistance behaviour of all four of these crystals is inconsistent with kondo scattering  @xcite .",
    "moreover mg was the only element whose concentrations were found to scale with the size of the resistivity upturns ; mg@xmath77mg@xmath78mg@xmath79 ( ppm ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that magnetic impurities were not responsible for the upturns in @xmath11 .",
    "the large increase in @xmath6(@xmath8 ) of @xmath65 and @xmath61 below @xmath80 argues against weak localization , whilst the very gradual nature of the upturn in @xmath6(@xmath8 ) suggests a lack of charge ordering in pr124 , most probably due to the stabilizing presence of the cuo@xmath81 planes .",
    "the form of @xmath6(@xmath8 ) for @xmath82 is best represented by a power law , ( e.g. dashed line in fig .",
    "4a ) for @xmath61 where @xmath11 varies as @xmath83 ) . below @xmath67",
    "however , the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath11 changes abruptly in all insulating samples . as illustrated in fig .",
    "4c ) for sample @xmath65 for example , @xmath6(@xmath8 ) increases approximately linearly with decreasing @xmath8 over a decade in temperature between 0.8k and 17k .",
    "the nel ordering of the pr ions thus splits the insulating behaviour into two disparate forms , one above @xmath67 which is divergent , and one below which is not , thereby making it difficult to identify the intrinsic transport behaviour in the insulating state .    for a quasi-1d metal ,",
    "the residual resistivity @xmath84 is independent of carrier density .",
    "hence @xmath84 can be used to obtain a direct measure of the intrachain mean - free - path @xmath85 . given that @xmath63 lies on the threshold between metallicity and localization , we can therefore extract an upper bound for the nominal mean - free - path @xmath86 at the metal / insulator boundary by extrapolating @xmath11 of @xmath63 from high @xmath8 down to @xmath87k . the dashed line in fig .",
    "4b ) is an extrapolation of the metallic @xmath9 dependence between 45k and 60k . from this",
    "we obtain , @xmath88 cm , giving @xmath89 215(25)@xmath90 .",
    "( note that there are 2 chains per unit cell in pr124 , and so @xmath84 = @xmath91 , where @xmath32 (= 3.88@xmath90 ) and @xmath18 (= 13.6@xmath90 ) are the @xmath32- and @xmath18-axis lattice constants respectively . ) since the @xmath92-axis lattice constant @xmath93 , this is equivalent to more than 50 unit cells .",
    "finally , taking estimates of the fermi wave vector @xmath94 (= 0.2 @xmath95 ) from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite , we arrive at @xmath96 at the localization threshold .",
    "it is important to stress that independent estimates of @xmath86 from transverse interchain magnetoresistance measurements _ that are insensitive to any uncertainties in the crystal dimensions and contact configurations _ agree very well with the value extracted from @xmath84 of sample @xmath63 , thus supporting the convention for voltage markers adopted here .",
    "localization at such large values of @xmath97 is unprecedented . in 3d fermi - liquids for example ,",
    "coherent ( bloch ) electron motion is destroyed once @xmath98 , corresponding to a mean - free - path shorter than the de broglie wavelength . in the normal state of the 2d cuprates ,",
    "the localization threshold occurs for @xmath99  @xcite , though its origin is as yet unknown . to our knowledge",
    "there have been no corresponding experimental studies of the localization threshold in quasi-1d systems .",
    "extensive theoretical studies however have predicted that an insulating phase develops in a _ strictly _",
    "1d system for a vanishingly small amount of random impurities  @xcite .",
    "the tendency towards localization in sample @xmath63 at @xmath100 suggests therefore that a fundamental change in the dimensionality of the electronic system has occurred and indeed , direct comparison of the relevant energy scales confirms this to be the case .",
    "according to arpes  @xcite , the fermi velocity within the chains @xmath101 ms@xmath102 .",
    "thus the intrachain scattering rate at the localization threshold @xmath103k . as discussed above ,",
    "@xmath104 ( as determined from @xmath105 ) is also proportional to @xmath106 .",
    "thus direct comparison of the three energy scales ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) is in fact independent of the value of @xmath106 .",
    "it is clear therefore that at the localization threshold , @xmath110 is comparable to both orthogonal hopping energies . in this circumstance ,",
    "intrachain scattering becomes sufficient to block coherent wave propagation between chains , making them decoupled electronically ; the presence of arbitrary disorder within the ( effectively isolated ) chains then leads immediately to localization at the lowest temperature , as predicted  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the form of @xmath11 for @xmath111 is best represented by a power law , ( e.g. dashed line in fig .",
    "4a ) for @xmath61 where @xmath112 varies as @xmath113 ) . whilst this is consistent with predictions for a luttinger liquid  @xcite , it should be stressed that the @xmath8-range is too limited to make any concrete claims .",
    "nevertheless , recent optical  @xcite and arpes  @xcite results do support the emergence of luttinger - liquid behaviour in pr124 , either in pure pr124 at high @xmath8 ( i.e. when @xmath114 or in zn - doped pr124 at low @xmath8 ( presumably when @xmath115 , though there no quantitative estimates of the energy scales were made ) . from both these studies ,",
    "the luttinger parameter @xmath116 is estimated to be @xmath117 , a value compatible  @xcite with the observation of a quasi - linear @xmath8-depenendence in @xmath112(@xmath8 ) at high @xmath8 , if one assumes a carrier concentration close to , but not quite , 1/4-filling .",
    "significantly the resistivity data do not exhibit the exponential behaviour expected for a 1d mott insulator at low @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the small value of @xmath116 suggests that this is due to deviations from commensurability , rather than to the absence of strong interactions .",
    "in this article , we have reported supporting evidence for the first experimental realization of disorder - induced one - dimensionality in a 3d solid at low temperatures .",
    "this has only been made possible in pr124 due to the extremely small values of @xmath0 ( @xmath118k ) in _ both _ perpendicular directions . in the quasi-1d organic conductors , such 3d to 1d crossover phenomena",
    "are extremely difficult to induce ( at low @xmath8 ) due to the large coupling in the second direction ( in ( tmtsf)@xmath81pf@xmath119 for example , @xmath120k  @xcite ) .",
    "this makes pr124 a rather unique bulk system with which to study physical phenomena on the boundary between fermi - liquid and luttinger - liquid ground states that complements existing work on chiral edge states in 2d heterostructures  @xcite . whilst it appears that disorder allows the manifestation of one - dimensionality in pr124 at low @xmath8 , it is , by its very nature , one displaying localized behaviour",
    "nevertheless , our results highlight one possible route to a delocalised luttinger - liquid at low @xmath8 , in ultra - pure pr124 under a tilted ( pulsed ) magnetic field with components in the @xmath121 plane larger than the two crossover fields @xmath105 .",
    "should such field - induced confinement also lead to an insulating state , then the paradigm that all states are localized in real 1d systems will gain yet more empirical confirmation .",
    "finally , let us remark on the observation that the dimensional crossovers in pr124 appear to occur once the strength of a particular perturbation , e.g. temperature @xmath8 , magnetic field @xmath26 , or scattering rate @xmath30 , exceeds @xmath0 .",
    "this contrasts markedly with recent studies on quasi-2d conductors where evidence for interlayer coherence is observed despite the fact that both @xmath122 and @xmath123  @xcite . clearly",
    "the phenomenon of interlayer or interchain decoherence in anisotropic metals is still poorly understood and it is only through further systematic studies that this important issue can be resolved .",

    "<S> in this article we report on the experimental realization of dimensional crossover phenomena in the chain compound 124 using temperature , high magnetic fields and disorder as independent tuning parameters . in purer crystals of 124 </S>",
    "<S> , a highly anisotropic three - dimensional fermi - liquid state develops at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this metallic state is extremely susceptible to disorder however and localization rapidly sets in . </S>",
    "<S> we show , through quantitative comparison of the relevant energy scales , that this metal / insulator crossover occurs precisely when the scattering rate within the chain exceeds the interchain hopping rate(s ) , i.e. once carriers become confined to a single conducting element . </S>"
