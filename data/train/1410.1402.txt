    "an important tool to probe the hot , dense matter created in heavy - ion collisions is the study of the particle azimuthal angular distribution in momentum space with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite . in high energy nuclear collisions the energy density reaches values above 1 gev/@xmath6",
    "at which the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  the theory of the strong interactions  predicts a phase transition from normal hadronic matter to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . by now , a large amount of experimental data has been obtained at the relativistic - heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large - hadron - collider ( lhc ) on the properties of strongly heated and highly compressed matter what allows to extract information on the equation of state of the excited matter as well as on the transport properties of the partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the detailed properties of this new phase are still far from being fully understood .    a large elliptic flow @xmath7 of charged hadrons",
    " observed at rhic  testifies the collective nature of the strong interaction at high energies .",
    "as the analysis shows  @xcite , the excited matter behaves like a colored almost perfect liquid  @xcite ( the so called strongly coupled qgp ",
    "sqgp ) rather than a weakly interacting parton gas .",
    "the elliptic flow has been measured by many collaborations at energies from the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) to the lhc and the scaling properties of flow harmonics , their dependence on centrality , rapidity and particle species have been studied .",
    "higher harmonics , @xmath8 , have been also intensively explored especially in recent years , when it became clear that odd harmonics are sensitive to fluctuations in the initial conditions .",
    "it finally turns out that the study of azimuthal asymmetries is closely related to structures in two - particle correlations of hard and semi - hard processes in the partonic phase  @xcite .    in more recent times",
    "much attention has been paid again to the directed flow @xcite of identified particles and the precise star measurements performed within the beam energy scan ( bes ) program in the energy range @xmath97.7 - 39 gev  @xcite have received a large attention .",
    "the directed flow refers to a collective sidewards deflection of particles and is characterized by the first - order harmonic @xmath1 of the fourier expansion of the particle azimuthal angular distribution with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "an analysis  @xcite of these data within the microscopic phsd transport approach and the collective three - fluid dynamics ( 3fd ) model reproduces the general trend in the differential @xmath10 excitation function and leads to an almost quantitative agreement especially at higher energies where the partonic phase is dominant .",
    "we recall that 3fd hydrodynamics @xcite shows a high sensitivity to the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and provides the best results employing a crossover for the quark - hadron phase transition in the model .",
    "note also that a crossover transition is implemented by default in the phsd approach .",
    "this flow analysis has shown no indication of a first order phase transition  @xcite as anticipated long before  @xcite . in all cases mentioned above only symmetric nuclear collisions",
    "have been considered .",
    "the most important parameters being varied in these analyses are the collision energy , the size of the system , and the centrality of the collision .",
    "an additional insight into the mechanism of particle production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions and the electromagnetic response for very early times can be gained from interactions of nuclei with different sizes , e.g. cu+au collisions at the top rhic energy of @xmath9200 gev .",
    "the study of the charged hadron multiplicity distributions and correlations in the longitudinal direction for asymmetric collisions gives additional constraints to the mechanism of the energy deposition in the early stage of the reaction  @xcite by exploiting the particle asymmetry in pseudorapidity . also , global characteristics of the directed flow are of substantial interest  @xcite .",
    "but it is more important , as expected in refs.@xcite , that the directed flow in asymmetric collisions may be partly generated by a specific source . an electric field ",
    "arising from the difference in charges of the colliding nuclei  may lead to a non - zero contribution to the directed flow of charged particles and possibly could be disentangled by measuring the directed flow of particles with equal mass but opposite electric charge .",
    "furthermore , one might have direct access to the positive and negative initial charge density by measuring charge differential flow . in this respect it is of great interest to compare the @xmath1 rapidity / pseudorapidity dependencies and transverse momentum dependence for identified hadrons that differ by the electric charge , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and to provide quantitative predictions for the differential observables .    very recently",
    ", asymmetric cu+au collisions have been performed at rhic and the directed flow for identified particles has been measured by the phenix collaboration  @xcite . in cu+au collisions , a substantial electric field directed from a colliding au nucleus to the cu nucleus",
    "is generated in the overlap region ( see below ) .",
    "this happens only when the colliding two nuclei carry a different number of electric charge .",
    "this electric field will induce an electric current in the matter created after the collision , resulting in a dipole deformation of the charge distribution .",
    "the time evolution of the system is known to be dominated by the strong radial flow , which is an outward collective motion of the medium .",
    "henceforth the charge asymmetry formed in the early stage is frozen .",
    "thus , it is argued that the charge - dependent directed flow of the observed hadrons is sensitive to the charge dipole formed at the early stage @xcite , which reflects the electric conductivity of the qgp   @xcite at early times . in symmetric collisions",
    "some other charge splitting may appear , its magnitude appears to depend strongly on the actual distance between the pion emission site and the spectator system and bring new , independent information on the space - time evolution of pion production  @xcite .",
    "we briefly recall that the early magnetic field @xmath13 @xcite also may lead to the induction of charged currents in the system .",
    "these currents result in a charge - dependent directed flow that is odd in rapidity and odd under charge exchange and has to be added to the effects studied in this work due to the electric field @xmath14 .",
    "the new goal of this paper is the study of the charge - dependent directed flow in terms of the phsd model for a quantitative specification / prediction of the @xmath1 splittings to be expected in two different scenarios",
    ". we will consider the production of @xmath15 mesons and @xmath16 baryons in cu+au collisions at @xmath17  gev taking into account the retarded electromagnetic field that is created dominantly by the proton spectators in the very early collision @xcite .",
    "as primary observables we will address the differential directed flow @xmath18 of these hadrons and explore the experimental perspectives .",
    "the dynamics of partons , hadrons , and strings in relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions is treated within the parton - hadron - string dynamics ( phsd ) approach .",
    "the phsd model is a covariant dynamical approach for strongly interacting systems formulated on the basis of kadanoff - baym equations  @xcite or off - shell transport equations in phase - space representation , respectively . in the kadanoff - baym theory",
    "the field quanta are described in terms of dressed propagators with complex selfenergies . whereas the real part of the selfenergies can be related to mean - field potentials of lorentz scalar , vector or tensor type , the imaginary parts provide information about the lifetime and/or reaction rates of time - like particles  @xcite .",
    "once the proper complex self - energies of the degrees of freedom are known , the time evolution of the system is fully governed by off - shell transport equations for quarks and hadrons ( as described in refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the phsd model includes the creation of massive quarks via hadronic string decay - above the critical energy density @xmath190.5 gev/@xmath20 - and quark             fusion forming a hadron in the hadronization process . with some caution",
    ", the latter process can be considered as a simulation of a crossover transition since the underlying equation of state ( eos ) in phsd is a crossover  @xcite . at energy densities close to the critical energy density @xmath21 , the phsd describes a coexistence of the quark - hadron mixture .",
    "this approach allows for a simple and transparent interpretation of lattice qcd results for thermodynamic quantities as well as correlators and leads to effective strongly interacting partonic quasiparticles with broad spectral functions . for a review on off - shell transport theory",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ; phsd model results and their comparison with experimental observables for heavy - ion collisions from the lower super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) to rhic energies can be found in refs.@xcite . in the hadronic phase ,",
    "i.e. for energies densities below the critical energy density @xmath21 , the phsd approach is identical to the hadron - string - dynamics ( hsd ) model  @xcite .    in the phsd",
    "the initial kinetic energy is converted in hard nucleon - nucleon collisions to string like configurations via pythia 6.4 and these strings decay to partonic quasiparticles with spectral functions in line with the dynamical quasiparticle model ( dqpm , see @xcite ) if the energy density is above critical ( @xmath22 gev/@xmath6 ) .",
    "the initial conversion of energy happens during roughly 0.15 fm / c at the top rhic energy when the nuclei pass though each other . at this time",
    "the energy density in between the leading baryons is very high due to the fact that the spacial volume is very small and @xmath23 0.3 fm in longitudinal extension ; the transverse contribution to this volume is given by the overlap area .",
    "due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation this energy density can not be specified as being due to particles since the latter may form only much later on a timescale of their inverse transverse mass ( in their rest frame ) .",
    "more specifically , only jets at midrapidity with transverse momenta above @xmath24 2 gev are expected to appear at @xmath25 fm / c while a soft parton with transverse momentum @xmath26 gev should be formed after @xmath27 0.5 fm / c .",
    "although it is not clear what the actual nature of the degrees of freedom is in this initial state , there will naturally be a small amount of electric charges due to charge conservation .",
    "on the other hand , if a large amount of electric charges ( from the conversion of energy to quarks and antiquarks ) are present in the very beginning of the reaction , then there should be observable signals from this early electric accelerator .",
    "it is our aim to quantify within phsd these possible signals and to provide robust predictions .",
    "we use here the phsd version where the creation of electromagnetic fields and particle transport in these fields are taken into account by means of the retarded linard - wiechert potentials  @xcite .",
    "only the source of the spectator protons is considered since this source is dominant at the initial stage when target and projectile spectators are close to each other . by the time of about 1 fm / c - after contact of the nuclei - the electromagnetic fields drop down by three orders of magnitude and become comparable with the field from the participants @xcite .",
    "this offers the very specific property of the early electric field to check experimentally if electric charges are already present at this instant .",
    "the time evolution of transverse electromagnetic field components is compared between asymmetric cu+au ( solid lines ) and symmetric au+au systems ( dotted lines ) in fig .",
    "[ e0b0-t ] where the l.h.s . displays the magnetic field components and the r.h.s",
    ". the electric ones .",
    "the maximal values of the magnetic field components @xmath28 are on the level of a few @xmath29 being comparable for both systems . for the symmetric case the results are in agreement with our earlier results in  @xcite .",
    "the electric field components also agree with the earlier results for symmetric collisions  @xcite but in case of the cu+au reaction the @xmath30 component is by a factor of @xmath235 larger than that for symmetric au+au collisions at the same energy  @xcite .",
    "this strong electric field @xmath14 is only present for about 0.25 fm / c during the overlap phase of the heavy ions and will act as an electric accelerator on charges that are present during this time .",
    "note that when charges appear only later together with the formation of soft partons ( @xmath31 0.5 fm / c ) there will be no corresponding charge separation effect on the directed flow ! in the case of symmetric collisions it was noted that @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this approximate equality is broken for asymmetric cu+au collisions where @xmath33 .",
    "[ field - diag ] , furthermore , shows the distribution in the strength and direction of electric field components for off - central cu+au and au+au collisions .",
    "this snapshot is made for the time when both nuclear centers are in the same transverse plane .",
    "this condition corresponds to different times for the two systems considered which is confirmed by a shift of the component @xmath28 in time ( cf .",
    "l.h.s . of fig .",
    "1 ) where the maximum is reached earlier in cu+au collisions . here",
    "we take @xmath340.05",
    "fm / c in view of fig .",
    "note that in cu+au collisions a significant electric field @xmath14 is generated in the overlap region of the two nuclei in @xmath35-direction , i.e. directed towards the lighter copper nucleus .",
    "the situation is different in collisions of nuclei of the same size  @xcite as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ field - diag ] ( r.h.s . ) . in symmetric collisions like au+au or cu+cu",
    ", the event - averaged electric field does not show a preferential direction and the magnitude of the electric fields generated in each event is lower , too .",
    "this strong electric field @xmath36 towards the cu nucleus at the early stage induces an electric current in the medium ( if electric charges are present ) . as a result ,",
    "the charge distribution is modified and a charge dipole is formed  @xcite . in central cu+au collisions the cu nucleus is completely embedded within the au - nucleus and due to the absence of cu spectators no sizeable electric current is formed .",
    "we note in passing that the electric field sharply drops after @xmath370.25 fm / c in free space , while in conducting matter the time dependence of the field strength is flattening out and reaches some plateau even up to @xmath34 10 fm / c  @xcite .",
    "the level of this plateau is proportional to the electric conductivity @xmath38 and therefore the conductivity effect could be sizeable in the case of a weakly interacting qgp .",
    "however , the electric conductivity - as evaluated within phsd in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions - is much lower and comparable to lattice qcd results for temperatures from 170 mev to 250 mev . for more details and explicit comparisons we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now the question is : what is the maximal strength of this induced current and how to see that experimentally ?",
    "it is widely recognized that fluctuations in the initial geometry of colliding nuclei are very important . at fixed impact parameter , depending on the location of the participant nucleons in the nucleus at the time of the collision , the actual shape of the overlap area may vary : the orientation and eccentricity of the ellipse defined by the participants fluctuates from event to event , i.e. the reaction plain fluctuates , too .",
    "we recall that taking into account these fluctuations in the initial geometry , the phsd model reasonably describes the rapidity dependence @xmath10 of the directed flow of charged hadrons including their slopes at midrapidity as well as the flow dependence on beam energy for symmetric au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic effects in particle emission clearly imply the dependence of specific observables on a particle charge , in particular also for particles of the same mass ( like e.g. @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons ) . for specific components of the electromagnetic field contributing to pion directed flow ( different from that in asymmetric collisions ) , such a charge dependence - charge splitting - was predicted even for symmetric nuclear combinations in refs .",
    "@xcite . in a simplified treatment of @xcite",
    "the effect is reduced to the relative distance between spectator blobs , which is a parameter to be         fixed by data in order to achieve an agreement with a particular experiment and therefore it is not robust .",
    "the importance of precise experimental data on directed flows measured separately for positive and negative pion charges @xmath41 becomes clearly evident .",
    "the results of the star collaboration on the directed flow of protons , antiprotons and pions in the au+au collision energy range from @xmath97.7 up to 200 gev have been recently published  @xcite .",
    "these data include measurements of @xmath1 for @xmath42 and @xmath40 for seven collision energies in the c.m.s .",
    "rapidity range of @xmath431 .",
    "the comparison of positive and negative pion directed flow at the @xmath97.7 gev ( but not at higher energies ) in intermediate centrality ( 10 - 40% ) au+au collisions displays a clear splitting of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 at positive rapidity .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , this appears consistent with the expectation of a specific charge - dependent component of the directed flow induced by electromagnetic effects but this connection should be checked independently .",
    "similarly to the symmetric case , the directed flow of hadron distributions in asymmetric cu+au collisions is defined as @xmath47 where azimuthal angles @xmath48 are measured with respect to the transverse direction of the reaction plane @xmath49 .",
    "ideally , the reaction plane @xmath49 is defined by the vector of the impact parameter and the beam direction .",
    "it is found that the magnitude of @xmath1 is correlated with the determination of the reaction plane .",
    "here we associate @xmath49 with the participants of the au - nucleus . for a comparison of @xmath1 distributions resulting from different definitions of the reaction plane",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ v1-pi ] are calculated for identified @xmath50 and @xmath51 mesons taking into account the spectator electromagnetic field as well as its influence on quasiparticle transport in both partonic and hadronic phases .",
    "the filled and empty circles result from calculations that assume all partonic charges to be present immediately after string dissolution to partons. the dashed and solid histograms are obtained in the other scenario when the early electric acceleration is discarded or when the charges are delayed to their formation time and therefore appear together with the formation of the charged partons ( quarks and antiquarks ) .",
    "these distributions as well as those presented below are calculated for the impact parameter range 4.7@xmath529.5  fm which corresponds to ( 10 - 40)% centrality . the number of simulated events amounts to @xmath53 in the case of including the electromagnetic field and without it .",
    "the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath1 exhibits a negative slope around mid-@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , @xmath54 displays a dipole - like asymmetry between the forward and backward rapidity distributions .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath1 at the forward pseudorapidity ( the au - like side ) is higher than that at the backward one ( the cu - like side ) . due to this nuclear asymmetry the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath54 for every hadron does not go through zero at midrapidity ( @xmath55 ) , as follows from table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "all the slopes at this point @xmath56 are negative and small as presented in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "an even stronger charge asymmetry of @xmath1 in forward and backward rapidities is seen at larger pseudorapidity ( @xmath57 2.5 ) , with the magnitude of @xmath1 at large backward pseudorapidity ( cu - like rapidity ) being lower than that at large forward pseudorapidity ( au - like rapidity ) .    .",
    "the directed flow at mid-@xmath4 , @xmath58 , for cu+au ( @xmath0= 200 gev ) collisions at @xmath59 fm . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     200 gev .",
    "the solid histogram is calculated in phsd for @xmath39 and the dashed one for @xmath40 mesons .",
    "results from phsd by including the effect of the electromagnetic field on early charges are marked by filled and empty circles for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",

    "[ v1-pi - auau ] the directed @xmath39 @xmath60 and @xmath40 @xmath61 flows from phsd are contrasted to the symmetric au+au case .",
    "as is seen there is practically no dependence of the @xmath10 distributions on the pion charge as well as on the electromagnetic field .",
    "note that similar phsd results have been obtained earlier for the same colliding system from the analysis of elliptic flow  @xcite . in agreement with this finding ,",
    "the @xmath39 and @xmath40 meson spectra measured in au+au collisions coincide with each other  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the charge - dependent asymmetry of the directed flow in cu+au collisions originates from the electric field asymmetry induced by the asymmetry in charge of the initial colliding nuclei but not as a particularity of the observable under consideration .",
    "the notation is the same as in fig .",
    "[ v1-pi ] . ]    the rapidity dependence of the directed flow @xmath54 for @xmath62 is presented in fig .",
    "[ v1-p ] . for antiprotons ,",
    "the @xmath54 is comparatively flat with a weak increase towards large pseudorapidities .",
    "the proton and antiproton results are close to each other at @xmath632.5 but strongly differ at higher rapidities due to contributions from the fragmentation process .",
    "the shape of the proton directed flow distribution @xmath54 resembles that for the created mesons ( cf .",
    "[ v1-pi ] ) since the mesons and baryons / antibaryons emerge dominantly by hadronization from the same partonic medium .",
    "one should note that the observed differences between the directed flow of protons and antiprotons could give information also on the different rate of baryon stopping on the cu and au side of the fireball .",
    "moreover , the reaction plane correlations in the fireball are modified in asymmetric collisions with stronger correlations between odd and even order event planes @xcite .",
    "[ v1-pt ] shows the phsd results for transverse momentum distributions of the directed flow .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath64 functions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons coincide with each other if electromagnetic forces are neglected ( histograms in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ v1-pt ] ) or if partonic charges appear only after @xmath27 0.5 fm / c . in this case",
    "the @xmath65 is negative in the forward direction and positive at negative angles @xmath66 .",
    "the inclusion of the early electromagnetic field noticeably changes these @xmath67 distributions increasing @xmath1 for negative pions and decreasing @xmath1 for positive pions . in both cases",
    "the splitting effect is clearly seen but the shape of @xmath68 also depends on the pion electric charge and pseudorapidity interval . for the backward @xmath40 emission the directed flow @xmath1 grows monotonically with momentum while @xmath69 for @xmath701.4 gev and then decreases with @xmath5 . as to the forward angles",
    "@xmath712 , the directed flow @xmath12 increases also but exhibits a wide negative minimum in the region of @xmath720.3 - 0.5 gev / c .",
    "the directed flow of positive pions is seen to decrease and then to flatten at @xmath731 gev / c , being negative in the whole transverse momentum range .",
    "the directed flow @xmath64 for protons and antiprotons shown in fig .",
    "[ v1-pt ] ( bottom panels ) displays a strong asymmetry in the forward and backward pseudorapidities , having a larger @xmath64 splitting at forward ( the cu - side ) pseudorapidity than that at backward ( the au - side ) pseudorapidity .",
    "note that even without taking into account the electromagnetic effect there is a difference in @xmath1 between @xmath74 and @xmath3 due to different interaction mechanisms of these hadrons ( see bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ v1-pt ] ) . in the baryonic case",
    "the influence of the created electromagnetic field is not so large as for pions and is more easily seen in the forward direction @xmath752 .",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath64 in the backward direction is a positive monotonously increasing function but in the forward direction @xmath760 with a weak wide minimum at @xmath770.7 gev / c for the case of antiprotons .",
    "the distribution @xmath64 for protons is similar to that for @xmath39 : it decreases till @xmath771  gev / c and then flattens .",
    "we finally note in passing that when including also the electromagnetic fields as induced by participant charges in addition to those discussed before , the control phsd calculations ( @xmath78 events ) on the charge - dependent directed flow presented in this work only change within the statistical accuracy .",
    "asymmetric cu+au collisions have been studied at the ultrarelativistic energy @xmath9200 gev within the phsd approach which is in a reasonable agreement with available experimental data for symmetric au+au collisions in the energy range from the sps to the top rhic energy . the retarded electromagnetic field induced by spectator protons has been calculated ( and quantified ) and its influence on the quasiparticle transport has been taken into account within two model scenarios : i ) if the initial field energy at times @xmath79 0.1 fm / c after contact is dominantly carried by ( still unformed ) charged quarks and antiquarks and ii ) if the quark / antiquark creation ( and accordingly the presence of electric charges ) is delayed to their formation time .",
    "independent on the two scenarios we have explicitly demonstrated that in peripheral collisions of cu+au an additional short - time electric field @xmath14 in the direction of the lighter nucleus emerges which at top rhic energies is essentially effective for the first 0.25 fm / c and is due to the asymmetry in the number of protons in the target and projectile nuclei .",
    "this additional electric field is not present in symmetric au+au collisions but can be used in asymmetric collisions to study the electric response of the medium during the passage time of the nuclei , i.e. also out - off equilibrium .",
    "in fact , the detailed phsd predictions for the charge differential directed flow @xmath80 in cu+au reactions show that the scenario i ) leads to clearly observable effects in the directed flow of hadrons with the same masses but different electric charges , for example @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "these differences can be studied by means of the charge - dependent pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath54 .",
    "high precision data on the transverse momentum dependence @xmath84 , furthermore , should clarify the situation and differentiate between the two scenarios because in case of ii ) there are almost no early electric charges of low @xmath5 and accordingly no effects from the early electric acceleration .",
    "the experimental observation of the splitting effect in charge - dependent observables of the direct flow would be a direct confirmation of the importance of electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy - ion collision dynamics and might shed further light on the effective degrees of freedom in the very early non - equilibrium phase and possibly also on the photon @xmath7-puzzle @xcite .",
