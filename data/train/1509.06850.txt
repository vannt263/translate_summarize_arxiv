    "more data are always better , but as we need to collect data at many points and the collection period is limited , we need to define lower limits for the number of data points and the luminosity needed at each point to ensure meaningful measurements of the physical quantities of interest .    as we require high - precision cross - sections for all of the open charm modes and the cross - sections of some hadronic transition modes to fit the resonant parameters of the vector states , we require sufficient data points to give the excitation curve of any of the existing vector resonances and possible hidden structures in the full energy range .",
    "some special issues need to be considered : ( 1 ) the thresholds of all the open charm and charmonium + hadron final states ; ( 2 ) possible energy regions where large interference effects are expected ; ( 3 ) energy regions where narrow structures are expected ; ( 4 ) energy regions that were not well explored before ; and ( 5 ) the beam energy spread .    from previous calculations and measurements ,",

    "otherwise , 10  mev steps will be used .",
    "the limit on the data size is set according to the precision of the hadronic transition modes , which typically have cross - sections of a few to a few tens of picobarns . from the analyses in previous sections , we find that an integrated luminosity of 500  pb@xmath16 is needed to reach a reasonably high precision for most modes of interest . to search for the @xmath0 and charmonium states via radiative transition",

    "has already accumulated about 5  fb@xmath16  ( see table  [ ecm_lum_xyz ] ) , another 25  fb@xmath16 data should be accumulated .",

    "figure  [ lum_belle2 ] shows the effective luminosity at bepcii energy in the belle - ii data samples .",
    "we can see that , for 10  ab@xmath16 belle - ii data , we have about 400500  pb@xmath16 data for every 10  mev in the range 45  gev , comparable to the data sample proposed at besiii in the previous section .",
    "of course , the isr analyses have a lower efficiency than in direct @xmath4 collisions because of the extra isr photons and the boost given to events along the beam direction . even taking these effects into account",
    ", the full belle - ii data sample , which corresponds to about 2,0002,300  pb@xmath16 data for every 10  mev from 45  gev , will result in similar statistics for modes like @xmath31 .",
