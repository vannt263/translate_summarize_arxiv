    "it is well known that , if we have a system composed by @xmath7 statistically independent subsystems ( i.e. , such that all joint probabilities factorize into the marginal ones corresponding to each subsystem ) , the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) entropy @xmath10 is strictly _ additive _ , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "a plethora of physical systems is known for which this remarkable property still holds _ asymptotically _ ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "such is the case , for instance , of virtually all many - body hamiltonian systems involving _ short_-range two - body interactions .",
    "this property is called _ extensivity _ , adopting the language of thermodynamics , where it plays an important role .",
    "many natural and artificial systems exist however that do _ not _ belong to this class , such as many - body hamiltonian systems involving two - body interactions whose range of interaction is _ long _ enough ( newtonian gravitation is one famous example ) .",
    "such systems are known to exhibit stationary ( or _ quasi - stationary _ or _ metastable _ )",
    "states that defy the usual , bg statistical mechanical prescriptions . for handling at least some of such anomalous systems , a generalization of bg statistical mechanics , has been proposed in 1988 @xcite , which is usually referred to as _ nonextensive _ statistical mechanics ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "it is based on the entropy @xmath13 , which generalizes the bg one .",
    "it has been shown recently that special collective correlations can be mathematically constructed such that the entropy which is strictly _ additive _ is now @xmath2 for an adequate value of @xmath3 ( directly determined by the type of correlations ) , whereas @xmath14 is _",
    "nonadditive_. it is easy to imagine that , in the same way that important classes of systems exist for which the strict additivity of @xmath14 is replaced by just asymptotic additivity ( i.e. , extensivity ) , a variety of classes must exist for which the strict additivity of @xmath4 is similarly replaced by asymptotic additivity ( i.e. , extensivity ) .",
    "such systems would be the object of the so - called nonextensive statistical mechanics .",
    "then , as a kind of bizarre linguistic twist , it turns out that the appropriate entropy @xmath2 for such , so - called _ nonextensive _ systems , is in fact expected to be _",
    "extensive_. the generic scenario is therefore as follows : all probabilistically well defined systems are expected to have an entropy which is extensive ; those whose appropriate entropy is @xmath14 ( or its associated forms , such as those adapted to fermions and bosons ) are called _ extensive _ , and those whose appropriate entropy is @xmath8 ( or even some other entropic form ) are called _ nonextensive_.    a quantity @xmath15 associated with a system @xmath16 is said _ additive _ ( see @xcite , which we closely follow here ) with regard to a specific composition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 if it satisfies @xmath18 where @xmath19 inside the argument of @xmath20 precisely indicates that composition .    if , instead of two subsystems @xmath16 and @xmath17 , we have @xmath7 of them ( @xmath21 ) , then we have that @xmath22 if the subsystems ( e.g. , just the elements of the full system ) happen to be all equal ( a quite common case ) , then we have that @xmath23 with the notations @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "an intimately related concept is that of _ extensivity_. it appears frequently in thermodynamics and elsewhere , and corresponds to a weaker demand , namely that of @xmath26 clearly , all quantities that are additive with regard to a given composition law , also are extensive with regard to that same composition ( and @xmath27 ) , whereas the opposite is not necessarily true .",
    "let us apply these remarks to entropy .",
    "boltzmann - gibbs ( @xmath28 ) statistical mechanics is based on the entropy @xmath29 with @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the probability associated with the @xmath32 microscopic state of the system , and @xmath33 is boltzmann constant . in the particular case of equiprobability ,",

    "boltzmann principle _ : @xmath36 from now on , and without loss of generality , we shall take @xmath33 equal to unity .",

    "it is from this property that currently used expressions such as _ nonextensive entropy _ and _ nonextensive statistical mechanics _ stand .",
    "however , special types of collective correlations do exist for which extensivity is recovered for the appropriate value of @xmath40 .",

    "the a priori total number of states is @xmath90 , but most of them have zero probability . in other words , the number of effective states ( i.e. , those whose probability is generically nonzero ) is only @xmath91 .",
    "consequently , a necessary condition for this very special type of correlation to occur is the system to have @xmath92 zeros in its table of joint probabilities .",
    "if the subsystems are all equal , we have @xmath93 , whereas @xmath94 . at the thermodynamic limit , it clearly is @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96=0 $ ] . if our subsystems were such that @xmath97 yielding a _ continuum _ , they would ultimately lead to a _",

    "a pictorial image can help understanding the _",

    "finite _ lebesgue measure . and the result would roughly be the same independently of the initial condition ( starting point of the travel )",
    ". this would be the typical dynamics associated with _",
    "strong _ chaos ( i.e. , _ positive _ lyapunov exponents ) , thus leading to the @xmath78 entropy . travelling in the way of a pilot of an airline company",
    "is quite different .",
    "first of all , he(she ) will only visit the set of airports through which this company operates .",
    "given the small size of the airports ( compared to the size of a wide territory ) , this set constitutes a set of virtually _ zero _ lebesgue measure .",
    "although statistically similar in geometrical terms , the result does depend on the initial conditions ( the most important hub of the network of japan airlines is tokyo , whereas the most important of varig is sao paulo , and the most important one of continental airlines is houston ) .",
    "although no rigorous proof whatsoever is yet available , the typical dynamics to be associated is _ expected _ to be that of _ weak _ chaos ( i.e. , basically _ zero _ lyapunov exponents ) .",
    "we expect the adequate entropy to be @xmath3 . if we wish to recover homogeneity in the visits , we need to average over virtually all the possible initial conditions .",
    "such an average is not needed for the @xmath78 case .",
    "occupancy of a phase space without strong restrictions makes equal probabilities of the joint system compatible with equal probabilities of each subsystem .",
    "this compatibility disappears if visiting of some regions of the joint space is strongly enhanced whereas visiting of others is strongly inhibited ( see figs . 4 and 7 ) .",
    "this is clearly seen for the generic @xmath77 case for any value of @xmath7 .",
    "it might be necessary to go to the asymptotic @xmath111 limit in order to see it for say @xmath112 . in any case , the dynamics conjectured for the @xmath3 cases seem to be compatible with a recent connection @xcite in terms of recurrent visits in phase space ( the @xmath78 limit corresponding to a poisson distribution of times between consecutive visits , during the time evolution of the whole system , of a given cell of phase space ) .",
    "let us elaborate some more on the important connection of @xmath40 with geometry .",
    "we consider , for simplicity , the case of @xmath7 equal subsytems @xmath44 , each of them having @xmath113 possible microstates .",
    "the total space has then @xmath93 possible microstates that can be represented on a discrete @xmath7-dimensional hypercube of linear size @xmath113 .",
    "we shall focus however on the effective number @xmath114 of microstates whose probability generically is _ not _ zero .",
    "a most trivial occupation is when only the  origin \" corner of the hypercube is occupied , i.e. , @xmath115 .",
    "we then have @xmath116 .",
    "a simple nontrivial case is when , in addition to that  corner \" , the @xmath7  edges \" of the hypercube starting from the  corner \" are occupied as well ( with generic probabilities ) .",
    "we then have @xmath117 , hence @xmath108 and @xmath77 , as already addressed .",
    "a next case in this series is occupancy of all the @xmath118  faces \" starting at that  corner \" .",
    "we then have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2 $ ] , hence @xmath120 and @xmath121 . the next case in this series",
    "is occupancy of all the @xmath122  cubes \" starting at that  corner \" .",
    "we then have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2+[n(n-1)(n-2)/6](w_1 - 1)^3 $ ] , hence @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "in general , if all the @xmath125-dimensional hypercubes starting at that  corner \" are occupied , we have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2+[n(n-1)(n-2)/6](w_1 - 1)^3+ ... +[n!/(n - r)!r!](w_1 - 1)^r$ ] , hence @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the last element of this series corresponds to fully occupy the unique @xmath7-dimensional hypercube .",
    "we then have @xmath119(w_1 - 1)^2+ ... +[n!/(n - r)!r!](w_1 - 1)^r+ ...",
    "+n(w_1 - 1)^{n-1}+(w_1 - 1)^n=[1+(w_1 - 1)]^n = w_1^n$ ] , hence @xmath78 .",
    "a different geometry which nevertheless belongs to the @xmath121 universality class is the following : if , in addition to the  corner \" , all the diagonals of the @xmath118  faces \" starting at that  corner \" also are occupied , we have @xmath128(w_1 - 1)$ ] , hence @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "another different geometry could be the following one : assume that , in addition to the  corner \" , the  edges that are ( strictly or substantially ) occupied are not all @xmath7 edges , but only those following the cantor set sequence @xmath129 , whose fractal dimension is @xmath130 . we then have @xmath131 ( we are assuming that @xmath7 is a power of @xmath132 ) , hence @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "a similar situation can occur for the @xmath113 states .",
    "suppose that , in addition to the  corner \" , all the @xmath7  edges \" are occupied but _ not _ fully occupied .",
    "suppose that the @xmath135 states are fractally occupied ( again the cantor , or any other sequence ) with fractal dimension @xmath136 .",
    "we then have @xmath137 , hence @xmath108 and @xmath77 .",
    "a quite general situation could be , in the @xmath138 limit , @xmath139 .",
    "in all these illustrations , the probabilities associated with the @xmath6 occupied microstates have no particular reason for being _ equally _ probable .",
    "they could very well constitute a network ( e.g. , a scale - free network ) whose occupancy probabilities would characterize main hubs , and secondary hubs , and so on ( quite like the previously mentioned set of airports used by a given airlines company ) .",
    "in fact , it would not be really surprising if classical long - range - interacting many - body hamiltonian systems would visit cells in phase space according to probabilities of this type .",
    "this is the typical scenario we expect for the family of entropies @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to imagine that there can easily be even more subtle situations for which the apropriate ( extensive ) entropy would be _ not _ included in the @xmath2 family for _ any _ value of @xmath40 .",
    "different entropic forms would perhaps be then needed .",
    "but even within the @xmath2 family , various aspects remain to be solved , that have been only preliminarly addressed here .",
    "let us mention two of them .",
    "first , the solutions that we have exhibited here are probably not unique ( see the captions of figs . 3 and 6 ) .",
    "other branches of solutions could well exist .",
    "we have been unable , at the present stage , to find them all .",
    "the reader surely realizes the nontrivial mathematical difficulty of _ simultaneously _ satisfying the impositions of theory of probabilities ( sum of all the joint probabilities equal to unity , partial sums of the joint probabilities equal to the marginal probabilities ) and those of extensivity of @xmath2 .",
    "the general solution seems to be @xcite intimately related with the recently introduced @xmath40-product @xcite @xmath140 , which has , among others , the following properties : ( i ) @xmath141 , ( ii ) @xmath142 ( whereas @xmath143 ; ( iii ) @xmath144 ; ( iv ) @xmath145 ; ( v ) @xmath146 .",
    "this interesting structure probably is one of the ingredients , but there are surely others to be considered concomitantly , specifically those related to the constraints imposed by theory of probabilities .",
    "second , to illustrate an important point let us rewrite eq .",
    "( 22 ) as follows : @xmath147 this relation means that it has been possible to find a function @xmath148 which satisfies the impositions of theory of probabilities .",
    "now , if we wish this solution to correspond to the extensivity of @xmath2 , we just impose @xmath149 .",
    "if we wish instead to impose the extensivity of @xmath150 we identify @xmath151 . in this case , we have solutions corresponding to @xmath152 .",
    "we can even impose , if we wish , the extensivity of @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is virtually any ( increasing or decreasing ) monotonic function of @xmath40 satisfying @xmath155 .",
    "this freedom _ might _ play a relevant role when a thermodynamical ( or thermodynamical - like ) connection is seeked . indeed ,",
    "most of the systems which seem to obey nonextensive statistical mechanics exhibit a ( quasi)stationary state whose entropic index is @xmath156 .",
    "this point needs further analysis in order to unambiguosly establish the identification between @xmath157 and @xmath40 which is thermodynamically adequate .",
    "it is interesting at this stage to recall a recent discussion by robledo @xcite on a nonthermodynamical system , which has nevertheless some analogy with the present situation . basically , the so called mori s _",
    "@xmath40-transitions _ for say the usual logistic map occur at both .2445 ... and 2 - 0.2445 ... @xcite .    a few words on terminology to conclude .",
    "we have seen that ( under specially correlated composition of subsystems ) @xmath2 can be strictly additive ( i.e. , @xmath87 ) for a variety of values of the entropic index @xmath40 .",
    "it has nevertheless become current denomination to refer to the @xmath78 universality class as _ extensive _ or _ normal _",
    "systems , and to the @xmath3 universality classes as _ nonextensive _ or _ anomalous _ systems .",
    "this use has originated from the fact that , in the early times of the theory , the focus was explicitly or tacitly put onto independent subsystems .",
    "_ for this simple composition law , and only then , @xmath14 is strictly additive ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) , whereas @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is not ( i.e. , @xmath85)_. although slightly misleading from the entropy standpoint , the current notational distinction _ extensive _ versus _ nonextensive _ is instead perfectly natural from the energy standpoint of hamiltonian systems . indeed ,",
    "suppose we have a @xmath159-dimensional classical system with attractive two - body interactions whose potential energy decays with ( dimensionless ) distance @xmath125 as @xmath160 .",
    "let us further assume for simplicity that a strong repulsion exist at the @xmath161 limit ( therefore no nonintegrable singularities exist at short distances ) .",
    "the lennard - jones gas would be @xmath162 ; newtonian gravitation would be @xmath163 ( if we take into account the fact that at very short distances , important repulsive quantum effects are expected which would avoid the mathematical problems tied to the @xmath164 singularity ) .",
    "the total potential energy at the ground state is expected to be @xmath165/(1-\\alpha",
    "/ d)$ ] , where we have assumed for simplicity that the @xmath7 elements of the system are roughly homogeneously distributed in space , and where the dimensionless distance @xmath125 has been chosen to be unity at the short distance effective cutoff .",
    "we immediately see that the energy is extensive if @xmath166 , whereas it is nonextensive if @xmath167 .",
    "it is long known ( see , for instance , @xcite ) that , for the @xmath166 systems , bg statistical mechanics is perfectly adequate .",
    "more over , for them the @xmath168 and the @xmath111 limits commute , thus always leading to thermal equilibrium . on the other hand ,",
    "plethoric evidence now exists that , in remarkable variance , for the @xmath169 systems , the @xmath168 and the @xmath111 limits do not commute , the physically interesting states for large systems being the ( quasi)stationary or metastable ones corresponding to taking first the @xmath111 limit and only afterwards the @xmath168 limit . for such anomalous states ,",
    "the inadequacy of bg statistical mechanics is notorious _ when we use no other dynamics than the natural one _ ( newton s law if the system is classical ) @xcite .",
    "for instance , the distribution of velocities is seemingly _ not _ maxwellian , and there is _ aging _ , a phenomenon absolutely incompatible with the translational invariance expected for thermal equilibrium .",
    "a transparent proof that nonextensive statistical mechanics ( with a @xmath3 entropy @xmath2 ) is in place is still lacking , but this could be the case . indeed , vanishing lyapunov exponents have been exhibited , as well as the specific anomalous diffusion associated with the nonlinear fokker - planck equation , and a variety of @xmath62exponential behaviors @xcite .",
