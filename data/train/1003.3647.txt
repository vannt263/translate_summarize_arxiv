    "however , before _ fermi _ ,",
    "the processes dominating the diffuse emission from the galaxy , especially above 1 gev , were unclear and highly debated  cf .  discussion on the _ gev excess _ reported by the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "_ fermi _ has clarified @xcite that the dominant emission mechanism is cosmic - ray interactions with interstellar gas , which leads to gamma rays mostly from pion decay in flight , i.e. , @xmath0 then @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the _ fermi _ egb differs from previous egret estimates : the intensity is _",
    "fainter _ and the spectrum _",
    "steeper _ , consistent with a power law of spectral index @xmath2 and integrated intensity @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "our theoretical understanding of the egb must therefore be substantially revised in light of the new and smaller _ fermi _ signal .",
    "pioneering studies investigating the origin of the egb first considered the collective emission form star - forming galaxies ( like the milky way ) , but found this to give a small egb signal @xcite .",
    "@xcite first incorporated observations of the cosmic star - formation rate , while  @xcite made the first estimates of the pionic contribution from star - forming galaxies . in both cases ,",
    "the predicted intensity was below the then - measured egb .",
    "blazars , the brightest extragalactic sources , have been the favored candidates @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent estimates of their contribution to the egb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have consistently fallen short . _ fermi _ point - source observations suggest that unresolved blazars contribute at most @xmath4 of the egb ; and thus the mystery has become acute @xcite .    here",
    "we present a more realistic model for the egb from star - forming galaxies , constructed to use as much as possible of our substantially improved multiwavelength observational understanding of these sources , and isolating the signal from normal star formation ( as opposed to starburst galaxies ) .",

    "( [ eq : egb ] ) are well - determined , so the egb entirely hinges on the luminosity density @xmath5 and its connection to cosmic star formation . in this study",
    "we construct , for the first time , a gamma - ray luminosity function ( distribution of sources by gamma - ray luminosity as a function of redshift ) for normal galaxies .",
    "the luminosity function is used to obtain the egb intensity , by integrating over luminosities and redshift along photon paths .    _ the star - forming luminosity density _ due to pionic emission follows from the gamma - ray luminosity per star - forming galaxy @xmath12 .",

    "_ scales with the cosmic - ray flux ( projectiles ) and the amount of interstellar _ gas _ ( targets ) in the galaxy .",

    "the pionic gamma - ray production rate per interstellar h - atom is @xmath19 and is proportional to the galaxy s _ volume - averaged _ cosmic - ray proton flux @xmath20 @xcite ; the cross - section @xmath21 is understood to include effects of pion multiplicity and of helium and heavier elements in the cosmic rays and interstellar medium .",
    "the factor @xmath22 gives the number of hydrogen atoms in the galaxy s interstellar medium , summed over all states  molecular , atomic , and ionized .",
    "this term is fixed by the galaxy s total interstellar gas mass via @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hydrogen mass fraction .    since cosmic rays",
    "are thought to be predominantly accelerated in sites associated with massive star formation ( supernova remnants , massive stellar winds , pulsars , see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , their flux in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma - pionic ] ) should scale with the _ star formation rate _ ( sfr ) in the galaxy . observations by _ fermi _ and tev telescopes hess and veritas have confirmed this expectation through observations of star - forming galaxies @xcite , for which both sfr and total gas mass were independently known .",
    "thus the cosmic - ray flux is set by the competition of particle acceleration and losses that we assume are dominated by escape , as they are in the milky way .",
    "these self - regulating processes tend toward an equilibrium @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the star formation rate and @xmath27 is the escape pathlength ( assumed constant ) .",
    "we thus adopt the scaling [ eq : scaling ] l_m_gas of gamma - ray luminosity with a galaxy s gas mass and star - formation rate @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "the gamma - ray spectrum has the same index : @xmath30 .",
    "even though both approximations are certainly simplifying , they represent important benchmark cases , against which more sophisticated models can be tested .    the scaling law of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) allows us to determine the gamma - ray output of any star - forming galaxy , but only once we normalize our results to a system in which the cosmic - ray and/or gamma - ray properties are known .",
    "we choose to normalize to the milky way , where the local cosmic - ray flux is well - measured , and the global star - formation rate is also known .",
    "we assume that the ratio of cosmic - ray flux to star - formation rate should be constant for all normal galaxies , i.e. , that = = = [ eq : ratio ] this scaling encodes the longstanding notion that supernova remnants accelerate hadronic cosmic rays ( leading to pionic emission , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we adopt the photon emission per hydrogen atom derived from _ fermi _ diffuse galactic observations at medium latitudes for photons @xmath31 mev : @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this value represents a large - scale ( @xmath33kpc ) spatial averaging of galactic cosmic - ray properties , which is appropriate for our global calculation .",
    "we can now write the gamma - ray luminosity density for normal galaxies [ eq : lumdens ] ( , z ) = x_h   ( z ) in terms of the cosmic star - formation rate @xmath34 .",
    "we define a mean interstellar gas mass as [ eq : mavg ] =    the assumption that losses are escape - dominated and uniform across galaxies can only be approximately valid at best .",
    "this is a major uncertainty in our model , which will benefit from future data on the egb and resolved galaxies .",
    "for example , even the leaky - box model can generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) to @xmath35 ; variations in the energy dependence of the escape length @xmath36 would also change the cosmic - ray and photon spectral indices which we take as universal .    indeed , _",
    "observations of the large magellanic cloud suggest that cosmic - ray confinement and propagation are non - trivial @xcite .",
    "moreover , starburst galaxies show very high cosmic - ray intensities within small volumes where inelastic collisions compete with , and sometimes dominate , outflows to regulate cosmic - ray losses @xcite . for this reason , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammalum ] ) provides a rough description of normal escape - dominated galaxies only ; we do not expect it to hold for starburst galaxies , which we will exclude below .",
    "we can infer a galaxy s interstellar gas mass at a given star - formation rate , via the well - established kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite .",
    "the _ surface densities _ for star formation and gas are found to be correlated via @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "both normal and starburst galaxies follow this correlation , but normal galaxies populate @xmath39 while starbursts occupy the opposite regime @xcite .    to recover a relationship between the global galactic star - formation rate @xmath40 and gas mass @xmath41 , requires a galactic disks scale length @xmath42 .",
    "we take @xmath43 ; observations @xcite indicate that this choice is uncorrelated with galaxy mass and star - formation rate at a fixed @xmath14 . combining this with the kennicutt - schmidt law ,",

    "a galaxy s luminosity in the  line provides a well - established tracer of star formation rate : @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the  distribution of galaxies ( luminosity function ) is related to the cosmic star - formation rate density via @xmath49 , which by now is well - measured as a function of redshift both by  and by other methods , so that its shape is well - determined observationally .",
    "the gamma - ray luminosity density is a different moment of the  luminosity function @xmath50 via our scaling laws above .",
    "we see that the gamma - ray luminosity distribution ( i.e. , luminosity function ) at a given redshift follows directly from the distribution of star - formation rates , as traced by .",
    "since we consider here only normal galaxies , we include only galaxies with @xmath51 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : max - sfr ] ) which sets corresponding limits @xmath52 , and @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : grld ] ) .",
    "current data on the  luminosity function can be fit to a schechter function , of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",
    "present data are consistent with the value @xmath56 , found for @xmath57 , persisting for all redshifts",
    ". data also fix the @xmath57 values @xmath58 and @xmath59 , for @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a star - formation rate @xmath61 .",
    "however , observations currently do not give unambiguous solutions for the other two parameters , the characteristic comoving density of star - forming galaxies @xmath62 and the characteristic  luminosity @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is unclear whether and how each parameter _ evolves _ with redshift .",
    "two limiting cases bracket the possible behaviors of the  luminosity function and thus of cosmic star formation . in the case of",
    "_ pure luminosity evolution _ the comoving density of stars is fixed , @xmath64 independent of @xmath14 , and all redshift evolution lies in @xmath65 .",
    "conversely , _ pure density evolution _ places the redshift evolution in the density scale @xmath66 while setting @xmath67 . in each of these two limits , we can find the redshift dependence of the parameters via the requirement @xmath68 .",
    "the redshift history of cosmic - star formation is well - known @xcite , and we encode this in the dimensionless `` shape '' function s(z ) ( z)/(0 ) .",
    "we then have @xmath69 in the case of pure luminosity evolution , and @xmath70 in the case of pure density evolution .    at a given redshift , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mavg ] ) gives the scaling @xmath71 . for our  luminosity function and kennicutt - schmidt relation",
    "we find a local value of @xmath72 . at other redshifts we have @xmath73 , and so @xmath74 .",
    "thus for the pure luminosity case @xmath75 , we find that the gas mass strongly evolves as @xmath76 , in response to the strongly changing sfr .",
    "consequently , the factor of @xmath77 rise in cosmic star - formation at @xmath78 implies a net gamma - ray luminosity increase of a factor @xmath79 . on the other hand , in the pure density evolution case ,",
    "galaxy sfrs are constant , @xmath80 , so that the mean gas mass @xmath81 actually _ decreases _ with redshift , while the comoving number of star - forming galaxies increases , but the net enhancement at high redshift is smaller than in the pure luminosity evolution case .",
    "this key difference leads to the factor @xmath82 between the egb predictions for the pure density and pure luminosity evolution cases seen in figure  1 .",
    "our full numerical calculation uses a milky way pionic source spectrum whose _ shape _ is derived from @xcite , calibrated to observations by normalizing the @xmath31 mev photon emission per hydrogen atom to the _ fermi _ result at intermediate galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "the cosmic sfr is from  @xcite . for the milky way sfr ,",
    "used to normalize the cosmic - ray flux / sfr ratio , we use the recent estimate of @xcite ( @xmath83 , a factor of 3 lower than earlier work ) .",
    "figure  1 shows our results for the normal galaxy contribution to the egb .",
    "we plot predictions for the limiting cases of pure luminosity and of pure density evolution .",
    "the uncertainties in the model inputs , summed in quadrature , propagate into the displayed error band that applies to each curve , which we estimate to be a factor of @xmath84 , resulting from uncertainties of : 30% in pionic emissivity @xcite , 40% in the normalization of the galactic star - formation rate @xcite , 40% in the cosmic star - formation rates @xcite , and 25% in the luminosity scaling in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mavg ] ) .",
    "the true systematic uncertainty would also reflect the idealizations in our model ( universal cosmic - ray spectra and confinement ) .",
    "these errors are hard to estimate but in any case imply that the uncertainty range in figure  1 is a lower bound to the error budget .    within errors ,",
    "our predictions for both limiting models fall at or below the level of the _ fermi _ data , where the data seem to support the pure luminosity evolution case that explains nearly the entire signal . comparing central values",
    ", this model gives @xmath85 of the _ fermi _ egb @xmath86 gev .",
    "thus , unresolved normal galaxies make a substantial and likely dominant contribution to the observed egb , without overpredicting the signal .",
    "even the pure density evolution case accounts for a minimum of 20% of the egb around 0.3 gev ; this provides a _ lower _ limit to the normal - galaxy signal .",
    "thus , any _ other _ egb sources @xcite must contribute no more than the remaining @xmath87 of the data . indeed , the lat team _ upper _ limit to the blazar egb contribution shown in figure  1 is comparable to our _ lower _ limit @xcite",
    ".    the spectral shapes of the two limiting cases are very similar : the peak in @xmath88 lies at @xmath89 gev because the bulk of the signal comes from @xmath90 .",
    "these models predict that the egb turns over for @xmath91 gev , a testable prediction of our model . for hadronic emission ,",
    "the high - energy spectral index is the same as the underlying proton spectral index , here @xmath92 ; this is somewhat steeper than the _ fermi _ single - power - law fit @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , our predictions at high energies ( @xmath94 gev ) fall below the data .",
    "if normal galaxies had a _ distribution _ of cosmic - ray spectral indices , the resulting egb spectrum would steepen at high energies where the hardest sources would dominate , developing a _",
    "convex tail_. indeed , the _ fermi _ egb data suggests a slight flattening of slope around @xmath95 gev , which might hint at such a transition .",
    "a galaxy with characteristic luminosity @xmath63 has @xmath96 .",
    "such objects have flux @xmath97 if they lie at distances @xmath98",
    ". thus _ fermi _ should eventually resolve n(>f ) ~4r_*^3  n_*(0)/3 = 5  ^3/2 normal galaxies , consistent with 23 detections to date ( the lmc , smc , and perhaps m31 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    our results do not account for starburst galaxies , nor for inverse - compton emission from any star - forming galaxies ; these must contribute to the star - forming egb , and could have hard spectra dominating @xmath94 gev .",
    "we have also neglected gamma - ray attenuation by extragalactic background light ( important at @xmath99 gev ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we will address these issues in future work .",
    "the amplitude and configuration of magnetic fields in a galaxy have an additional effect on the scaling of cosmic - ray flux with sfr .",
    "confirmation that normal galaxies comprise the bulk of the fermi signal would constitute a unique probe of the evolution of these magnetic fields between the redshift of peak star formation and today .",
    "because of their ubiquity , normal galaxies produce the smallest anisotropies in the egb , far less than blazars or other proposed sources .",
    "thus , by studying the observed egb anisotropy as a function of energy , it may be possible to disentangle the spectrum and amplitude of the normal - galaxy contribution from that of other sources @xcite .",
    "moreover , because normal galaxies seem to dominate the _",
    "egb , their small contribution to anisotropies will fortuitously provide the optimal chance of finding smaller and more exotic sources in the observed signal @xcite .",
