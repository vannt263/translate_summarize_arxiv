    "there has been a great deal of recent theoretical and experimental activity on topological insulators ( tis )  @xcite , which are band insulators that can not be adiabatically transformed into the vacuum state so long as time - reversal and charge - conservation symmetries are maintained .",
    "a ti is an example of a more general class called symmetry - protected topological ( spt ) phases  @xcite , which can not be adiabatically transformed into the vacuum state so long as a symmetry group @xmath2 is preserved . at the 2d surface of a system in a 3d spt phase , one of the following three possibilities must occur : ( 1 ) there are gapless excitations ; ( 2 ) the symmetry group @xmath2 is broken ; or ( 3 ) as noted by senthil and vishwanath  @xcite , the surface develops topological order . in the latter case , the system can not be adiabatically continued into the vacuum state even if the symmetry group @xmath2 is not preserved .    for instance , if the 3d system is in the shape of a solid torus , so that the topologically - ordered surface is on the boundary of the solid torus , then the system will have several degenerate ground states , unlike a trivial insulator such as the vacuum .",
    "consider , for the sake of concreteness , a 3d non - interacting fermion ti . in scenario 1 ,",
    "the surface state consists of an odd number of time - reversal invariant ( tri ) gapless dirac fermions . in scenario 2",
    ", the surface of a 3d ti can be gapped by breaking either time - reversal @xmath3 symmetry or charge conservation @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath3-symmetry is broken , the surface enters a gapped integer quantum hall state  @xcite with hall conductivity @xmath5 .",
    "when charge conservation is broken by an @xmath0-wave pairing field , the surface enters a superconducting state  @xcite which has a majorana zero mode in each @xmath6 vortex .",
    "though the superconducting state supports vortices with non - trivial braiding statistics , it is not a topological phase  since it is _ gapless _  but is , instead , a quasi - topological phase  @xcite exhibiting broken symmetry . a theory realizing scenario 3  a topologically - ordered @xmath3- and @xmath4-symmetric surface state  has not been previously constructed for the fermionic ti , despite its being the first 3d spt phase discovered . in this paper , we construct a topological phase that respects these symmetries .",
    "the phase that we construct respects time - reversal invariance and charge conservation .",
    "we believe that it is a minimal theory supporting ising - type non - abelian anyons and respecting both of these symmetries .",
    "it can be realized as the gapped surface of a 3d system according to scenario 3 , but can not be realized in a strictly 2d system .",
    "we start from the fu - kane surface superconducting state  @xcite , in which time - reversal symmetry is preserved and charge conservation is broken by the pairing order parameter . if one type of vortex proliferates due to quantum fluctuations , the system can be driven into an insulating state with restored charge conservation .",
    "we consider the case in which the vortex that condenses has flux @xmath7 , or @xmath8 times the flux quantum @xmath6 . based on general arguments , such as adiabatic charge pumping ,",
    "we obtain the charge , topological spin , and time - reversal transformation properties of the minimal surface theory consistent with several further assumptions discussed in section  [ sec : vortexcond ] .",
    "the resulting state is an analogue of the @xmath9 moore - read pfaffian state  @xcite , but with its charge and neutral sectors having opposite chiralities with respect to each other .",
    "we discuss the realization of time - reversal symmetry in this state and analyze the boundary line between this state and symmetry - breaking gapped surface states .",
    "finally , we consider generalizations .",
    "our result will be explained using the formalism of anyon models , so we begin with a brief introduction to topological charge , fusion rules , quantum dimensions , and topological twist factors , using , as examples , two models relevant to our construction . in appendix",
    "[ sec : anyon_models ] , we give a more detailed discussion , focussing on associativity relations , braiding , and the action of modular transformations on the torus , i.e. on @xmath10-symbols , @xmath11-symbols , and @xmath12-matrices .",
    "before studying the surface topologically - ordered state , it is helpful to review the topological properties of two relevant anyon models that will be useful for constructing the surface theory .",
    "we will use these models to fix the notation and terminology used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we first review the ising anyon model .",
    "this model governs the topological order of the gapped non - abelian phase of kitaev s honeycomb lattice model  @xcite and of a quantum - disordered @xmath13 superconductor .",
    "the ising anyon model has three quasiparticle types , labeled by the respective topological charges : @xmath14 ( vacuum ) , @xmath15 ( non - abelian anyon ) , and @xmath16 ( fermion ) .",
    "the fusion algebra or `` fusion rules '' specifying what can result when topological charges are combined or split are given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "it follows that the quantum dimensions are @xmath19 ( as is the case for all abelian anyons ) and @xmath20 .",
    "the quantum dimensions characterize how the dimension of the low - energy state space increases asymptotically as quasiparticles of the respective charge type are added to the system , e.g. @xmath21 of @xmath22 @xmath15-quasiparticles has @xmath23 for @xmath22 large .",
    "the topological twist factors associated with the braiding statistics of the quasiparticle types are @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the twist factors are the phases that result when the respective quasiparticles are rotated by @xmath27 , and can thus be thought of as related to the `` spin '' values @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( defined modulo 1 ) via @xmath31 .",
    "if the system is on a curved surface , the topological twist factors parameterize the coupling of the quasiparticles to the curvature .",
    "we will also need the @xmath32 anyon model , which has @xmath33 quasiparticle types , labeled by topological charges : @xmath34 .",
    "the fusion rules for these topological charges are @xmath35_{n}$ ] , where we introduce the notation @xmath36_{n } = j ( \\text{mod } n)$ ] .",
    "this clarifies the @xmath37 in the naming convention of this anyon model . as these are all abelian anyons , they all have quantum dimension @xmath38 .",
    "the superscript @xmath39 in the naming convention signifies that the twist factors are @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath33 odd , @xmath41 can take any integer value ( though these are not all distinct theories ) . for @xmath33",
    "even , @xmath41 can take any integer or half integer value",
    ".    the @xmath42 anyon model will be particularly significant in this paper .",
    "such a theory , which corresponds to a u@xmath43 chern - simons theory , can arise in the quantum hall regime if electrons pair into charge @xmath44 bosons that condense into a @xmath45 bosonic abelian quantum hall state ( which has filling @xmath46 with respect to the electrons ) , as discussed by halperin  @xcite .",
    "we will denote such a quantum hall state by @xmath47 .",
    "the topological charge label @xmath48 of a quasiparticle in @xmath47 is equal its electric charge in units of @xmath49 modulo @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to the quasiparticle types , fusion rules , quantum dimenions , and topological twist factors given above , anyon models are characterized by associativity @xmath10-symbols and braiding @xmath11-symbols , which specify multi - particle braid group representations .",
    "finally , the @xmath12-matrix governs the modular transformation properties of ground states on the torus , i.e. the invariance of the theory under diffeomorphisms that are not continuously connected to the identity .",
    "the definitions and properties of these quantities are discussed in appendix  [ sec : anyon_models ] .",
    "we can construct new models by combining ising anyons and abelian anyon models , such as the @xmath51 model given above .",
    "as we will see in the next section , the symmetry - respecting topological phase at the surface of a 3d fermionic ti is described by such a combined theory .",
    "such anyon models are completely determined by their quasiparticle types , fusion rules , quantum dimensions , and topological twist factors  @xcite . in other words ,",
    "these quantities uniquely specify the anyon model ( up to choice of gauge ) and allow us to generate the @xmath10-symbols and @xmath11-symbols .",
    "consequently , we will primarily focus on deducing the quasiparticle types , fusion rules , quantum dimensions , and topological twist factors in this paper .",
    "we now return to the surface of 3d topological insulators .",
    "we first outline the procedure that we will use to derive the surface theory .",
    "we start from the fu - kane superconductor and characterize the topological properties of the vortices in a manner analogous to the description of topologically ordered states .",
    "( although the superconducting state is a broken symmetry state , it is a quasi - topological state  @xcite and , therefore , has many of the properties of a topological phase . )",
    "we conclude that an @xmath52 vortex ( i.e. flux @xmath7 ) is the minimal neutral boson that can be condensed without breaking any symmetry .",
    "using very general considerations , we determine the topological spin of the quasiparticles that remain when @xmath52-vortex condensation destroys superconductivity .",
    "this enables us to obtain the resulting time - reversal- and charge - conservation - preserving surface topological theory , which we will denote by @xmath53 . finally , we subject our result to a number of consistency checks .",
    "we first consider the fu - kane superconducting phase , and assume that it is a 2d superconductor with 2d algebraic long - range order .",
    "although the state is not topologically - ordered , @xmath54 vortices have majorana zero modes and well - defined projective non - abelian statistics  @xcite .",
    "when two @xmath54 vortices are fused or braided , they behave like the non - abelian @xmath15-quasiparticle in the ising topological phase , except that the twist factor is not well - defined due to gapless phase fluctuations and the the long - range interactions that they mediate . a double vortex with vorticity @xmath27",
    "has no majorana zero mode and is , thus , abelian .",
    "another key difference between vortices in the fu - kane superconducting state and ising anyons is that the former carry a well - defined vorticity , which is conserved during the fusion process .",
    "consequently , vortices with vorticity @xmath54 and @xmath55 are distinct , although both carry similar majorana zero modes .",
    "we will denote the non - abelian vortex with vorticity @xmath56 by @xmath57 , and denote the abelian vortices with vorticity @xmath58 by @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we have added tildes @xmath61 to the labels , to distinguish them from the  real \" topological charges of quasiparticles in the topologically - ordered state . here , @xmath62 denotes the trivial / vacuum quasiparticle and @xmath60 is obtained by creating a bogoliubov quasiparticle @xmath63 in the state @xmath59 .",
    "these vortices satisfy the fusion rules @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "consequently , we assign quantum dimensions @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "now we need to determine which vortex type can condense to drive a superconductor - insulator transition . in an ordinary superconductor , @xmath54 vortex condensation leads to a band insulator ( which would require charge - density - wave order unless there is an even number of electrons per unit cell of the lattice ) and @xmath27 vortex condensation leads to a mott insulator . in the case of a fu - kane surface superconductor , one needs to be careful due to the presence of majorana zero modes in @xmath54 vortices .",
    "we consider the case in which the vortex that condenses is a boson , meaning that it is abelian and has trivial self - statistics   of the condensing quasiparticle must satisfy the conditions that @xmath68 and that there exist a fusion channel @xmath69 of two @xmath70 charges such that @xmath71 .",
    "while the topological twists and overall phases of braiding factors are not well - defined in the fu - kane superconductor phase , one can also argue that for ising - type non - abelian anyons ( meaning ising up to abelian anyon factors ) where these are well - defined , one can not simultaneously satisfy these conditions . in any case",
    ", we will not consider such condensations in this paper . ] .",
    "if the vortex @xmath72 with vorticity @xmath73 condenses , then vortices with vorticity @xmath74 and @xmath75 are identified , and the vortices with vorticity @xmath74 with @xmath76 become topological quasiparticles in the resulting topological state . in the following",
    "we will denote vorticity @xmath74 by @xmath22 for simplicity .",
    "the arguments in the next two subsections depend on the following natural assumptions .",
    "_ there is a finite number of quasiparticle types in @xmath53 .",
    "_ this is the usual assumption in a topological phase , without which the theory can not be tightly - constrained by self - consistency . in the present context , since there are only @xmath77 possible distinguishable vorticities modulo @xmath77 when a @xmath73 vortex condenses , this assumption is equivalent to the assumption that , at most , a finite number of new quasiparticle types result from vortex condensation .",
    "_ when a @xmath77-vortex condenses , the quantum dimensions of the remaining @xmath76 vorticity vortices do not change , and abelian and non - abelian vortices do not hybridize .",
    "_ physically , this means that the majorana zero modes remain stable during the @xmath73 vortex condensation , since the @xmath73 vortex is invisible to majorana zero modes ( and also to bogoliubov quasiparticles ) . based on this assumption",
    ", we must obtain a theory with quasiparticles with quantum dimensions @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "each quasiparticle in @xmath53 has a well - defined electrical charge , due to charge conservation symmetry .",
    "_ there is at most one non - abelian quasiparticle type with a given value of electrical charge .",
    "_ this is even stronger than the previous assumption : we are assuming that no new non - abelian quasiparticle types result from vortex condensation .",
    "this is the least - justified of our assumptions and , in fact , a recently - constructed theory for the surface of a fermionic topological insulator @xcite does not obey this assumption .",
    "although we have no guarantee that a theory that satisfies this assumption can be realized on the surface of a conventional fermionic ti ( i.e. the state that is continuously connected to a ti of non - interacting fermions ) , we will proceed and see if such a theory exists and respects time - reversal and charge - conservation symmetries .",
    "we first focus on the abelian quasiparticles which are descendants of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 vortices in the quasi - long range ordered phase .",
    "if a bosonic vortex @xmath72 is condensed , we obtain abelian quasiparticles with a well - defined ( but possibly fractional ) charge @xmath80 and a vorticity @xmath81 modulo @xmath77 . to understand the electrical charges carried by the abelian quasiparticles , we consider an adiabatic flux - threading process in the configuration illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] ( a ) .",
    "the bulk of 3d ti is a solid torus , and part of the upper surface [ the yellow annulus in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab](a ) ] is in the symmetric topological phase @xmath53 .",
    "the rest of the surface , denoted by @xmath82 , is in a @xmath3-breaking @xmath83 integer quantum hall ( iqh ) state with trivial topological order , which can be realized by coating the surface with a ferromagnetic insulator .",
    "the states @xmath53 and @xmath82 occupy annular regions , which are joined together at the edges @xmath84 and @xmath85 , thereby forming a 2d torus on the surface of the 3d solid torus .    in this geometry , we can use laughlin s adiabatic flux insertion argument  @xcite : by adiabatically threading a magnetic flux through the central hole , we can transfer charge ( via the hall conductance of @xmath82 ) from the inner edge @xmath84 to the outer edge @xmath85 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab](a ) .",
    "since @xmath53 preserves time - reversal symmetry , it does not contribute to the hall current , and the charge pumped during this process is completely determined by the hall conductance @xmath86 of the @xmath82 region .",
    "when @xmath87 flux is threaded through the central hole , the charge pumped to the inner edge @xmath84 is @xmath88 .",
    "since the system with flux @xmath89 is gauge equivalent to the original system with flux @xmath90 , the final state must be an energy eigenstate of the original hamiltonian .",
    "in other words , there must be charge @xmath91 quasiparticles in this system .",
    "however , the phase @xmath82 is an iqh state with no fractionally - charged excitations .",
    "therefore , the state @xmath53 must have a charge @xmath91 quasiparticle excitation .",
    "meanwhile , threading flux @xmath89 through the superconducting state induces a vortex with vorticity @xmath27 ( corresponding to either @xmath92 or @xmath93 ) .",

    "our next task is to determine the twist factors @xmath106 for each quasiparticle type @xmath105 .",
    "the twist factors can be determined by the following three simple principles :    1 .",
    "the trivial / vacuum quasiparticle corresponds to the label @xmath107 .",

    "consequently , the @xmath1 vortices are coupled to the spatial curvature . by contrast , since the @xmath305 phase on the surface of a 3d ti has @xmath0-wave symmetry , the superconducting order parameter does not couple to the curvature of the surface , because the condensate does not break rotational symmetry .",
    "therefore , the vortices are also not coupled to spatial curvature .",
    "the absence of coupling to the curvature implies that @xmath366 .",

    "time - reversal acts in a relatively straightforward manner for these theories . in this paper , we have seen a rather different sort of time - reversal invariant topological phase .",
    "it can be understood in terms of two opposite chirality sectors , but they are very different ( although only a restricted subset of their product is allowed ) : one sector is electrically neutral and non - abelian while the other is electrically charged and abelian .",
    "nevertheless , under the unconventional time - reversal transformation discussed above , the state is time - reversal invariant",
    ". it would be interesting to see if there are more direct physical consequences of this unusual transformation law and also whether there are novel time - reversal invariant versions of other topological phases , e.g. one that contains fibonacci anyons .",
    "although this paper is focussed primarily on a question of principle , we now comment briefly on possible physical realizations",
    ". the surface of a topological insulator such as bi@xmath369se@xmath370 can be gapped by covering it with a superconducting film . however , it would then be necessary to destroy the superconducting order so that the surface can enter a topological phase .",
    "it is not clear how to do this .",
    "one could imagine patterning the superconducting film into a josephson junction array and then increasing the charging energy for each superconducting island until superconductivity is destroyed , but it is possible that this will leave gapless regions between the superconducting islands .",
    "an equally serious problem is that all putative topological insulators are not truly insulating and , in fact , have relatively high bulk carrier densities .",
    "the topological properties described here would require true insulating behavior in the 3d bulk in order to be observed , but there may be a range of time scales over which they are observable for sufficiently - low bulk conductivity . alternatively , it may be possible to realize such a phase in a system of cold atoms , where it has been proposed  @xcite that a synthetic 3d spin - orbit coupling can be realized , and there are proposed realizations of 3d topological insulators  @xcite .    during completion of this manuscript",
