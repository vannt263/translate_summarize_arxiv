    "the practical applicability of theoretical aspects of modern condensed - matter systems , including electronic , magnetic , spectroscopic , thermodynamic and quantum chemical properties of matter have been greatly simplified by the advent of density functional theory(dft)@xcite .",
    "dft , is one of the most successful approach to address the complex effects of the many electron phenomenon and continues to be the same .",
    "tremendous advances beyond the local density approximation(lda ) are achieved through the development of wide range of semilocal and non - local exchange - correlation(xc ) functionals @xcite with varying properties in order to accurately describe the ground state in three dimensions(3d ) . however , cutting edge research in low dimensions including , atomistic to artificial structures e.g. , quantum dots , modulated semiconductor layers , quantum hall systems and artificial graphene has also gained momentum and keenly attracted the attention of researchers so far as the theoretical and experimental findings are concerned @xcite . the methodology applied successfully to describe 3d systems can not be applied directly to its two dimensional(2d ) counterpart due to various limitations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the search for accurate non - local and semilocal xc functionals for describing such systems is a growing research field @xcite .",
    "the higher order functionals are proposed depending on their complexity and efficiency .",
    "one rung higher of the 2d - lda is 2d - gga , which is only the functional of reduced density gradient . despite of its grand success in achieving accuracy ,",
    "still demands potentiality in describing various electronic regime .",
    "for example , the shell structure of parabolic quantum dots is visualized through the topology of electron localization factor(elf ) @xcite .",
    "the elf is functional of density gradient and kinetic energy density .",
    "therefore , in order to separate out different physical regions using different ingredients is of prime importance . so that one region can be distinguished from the other . in this context",
    ", the ks - ke density along with reduced density gradient play significant role .",
    "the ks - ke dependent functionals are knows as meta - ggas . not only that the meta - ggas are the most accurate functional described within semilocal formalism of 2d - ks - dft  @xcite .",
    "also , the behavior of the ks - ke plays a significant role in designing the meta - gga functionals .",
    "the behavior of the ks kinetic energy density has been studied thoroughly in 3d @xcite but due to the aforementioned time lag between the inception of the 3d and 2d metagga xc functionals , the behavior of the ks - ke in 2d has not been explored much as compared to its 3d counterpart .",
    "the mainstay of this paper is to study the behavior of ks - ke in 2d by considering 2d quantum harmonic oscillator as a test case .",
    "it has been suggested through the elf that  @xcite , near nucleus ( i.e. at origin ) and asymptotic region , the ks - ke behaves one electron like and therefore reduces to von weizscker ke .",
    "however , it has been noticed that near the nuclear cusp and at the asymptotic region the ks - ke differs from its von weizscker counterpart significantly as contributions from different orbitals play crucial role . as a matter of which , several 2d meta - gga ingredients can be formed by using the ratio of different kinetic energy densities because they remain invariant under uniform density scaling . not only that , by constructing exactly the enhancement factor , the correct asymptotic behavior of the exchange energy density and potential at meta - gga level can also be deduced . here , we have considered completely a different and intriguing approach to study various regions of 2d systems . the work is organized as follow : in the next section we will derive a theoretical framework to thoroughly study the nature of ks - ke near the nuclear cusp and far away from it i.e. , asymptotic region .",
    "then , the behavior of different meta - gga ingredients will be derived by taking the ratios of the kinetic energy densities at different regions of the density profile .",
    "lastly , an exchange only functional from meta - gga ingredients with correct asymptotic potential and exchange energy density will be constructed using formally exact properties of enhancement factor .",
    "the total electronic energy within density functional formalism is given by , @xmath0 = t_{ks}[\\rho ] + u[\\rho ] + \\int~\\rho(\\vec{r})v_{ext}(\\vec{r})d^2r + e_{xc}[\\rho ] , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is ground state density , @xmath2 $ ] be the ks non - interacting ke , @xmath3 is the hartree energy , @xmath4 is the external potential ( in our case @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 is the xc energy . only the hartree energy and ks non - interacting ke are exactly known in terms of density and orbitals respectively .",
    "the exact form of xc energy is the unknown ingredient in dft and need to be approximated . in dft ,",
    "the spin polarized positive definite ks kinetic energy density is defined as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the occupied ks spin orbitals .",
    "but it is not unique as any term whose integral vanishes may be added to construct different form of the ke density .",
    "however , eq.([eq2 ] ) is physically and numerically most important because it is stable due to involvement of only the first order derivative of orbitals . in 3d , it has been suggested that near nucleus and asymptotic region ks - ke behaves as vw kinetic energy density @xcite .",
    "however , the behavior of @xmath9 for 2d has not been explored much which is the mainstay of this work .",
    "lets now begin by considering the single electron non - interacting eigenstates of 2d isotropic harmonic oscillator having external potential @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the confinement strength of the oscillator .",
    "this simple system is very useful to gain better physical insight of the kinetic energy of finite systems in 2d",
    ". we will investigate in details the two important avenues i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "the vw - kinetic energy density is obtained by substituting the expression of @xmath26 , eq.([eq4 ] ) in vw - kinetic energy density i.e. @xmath27 and together with eq.([eq5 ] ) one obtains , @xmath28 + \\frac{l^2\\rho_{nl}^{\\sigma}(r)}{r^2}. \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] this is the paramount equation of our investigation . since , the total positive defined ks kinetic energy density is @xmath29 as , in general @xmath30 $ ] , i.e. , total vw - ke density may or may not be equal to the sum of separate orbital vw - ke density .",
    "therefore , the ks kinetic energy density in general not equal to @xmath31 .",
    "but equality holds only for linear case .",
    "thus , eq.([eq6 ] ) is valid for any shell of the parabolic external potential for 2d system .",
    "now , we will rigorously elaborate upon the behaviors of ks kinetic energy in two physically important regions , namely at @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "asymptotic region is equally important in density functional formalism as several exchange energy functionals have been designed using the asymptotic behavior of exchange potential , @xmath59 or energy density , @xmath60 such as 2d - b88 @xcite , 2d - br @xcite and 2d - bj @xcite functionals .",
    "however , the property of ks - ke in this region is very useful in designing functionals for 2d systems with correct asymptotic behavior at meta - gga level .",
    "construction of meta - gga type functional for 2d systems recently gained momentum because of first ever construction of a density matrix expansion based exchange energy functional @xcite . in asymptotic region ,",
    "the contributions of the outermost valence shells only count .",
    "we denote the outer shells as @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where the prime denotes the asymptotic quantities .",
    "now we consider , eq.([eq6 ] ) and from this we define a quantity @xmath64 which accounts for the deviation of the ks kinetic energy density from its vw counterpart i.e. , @xmath65 from the above expression , it is quite clear that if we consider @xmath66 type outer shell , then @xmath67 exactly approaches to @xmath68 . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath69 , then the contributions of the other outer shells also count . in that case",
    ", @xmath70 decays as @xmath71 .    ) , n = 12 ( @xmath72 ) and n = 20 ( @xmath73 ) . for n = 6 ( @xmath74 )",

    "it is also evident that , as @xmath13 , @xmath80 . in that case , @xmath81 .",
    "thus , in @xmath13 , the correct vw behavior is achieved by ks kinetic energy density . here",
