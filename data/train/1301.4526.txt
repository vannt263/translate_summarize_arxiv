    "the idea that a spatial soliton and a surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) can couple to form the soliton - plasmon , or _ soliplasmon _",
    ", bound state was originally proposed in ref .",
    "these authors proposed by means of a sharp physical intuition that the bound system should obey in certain limit a nonlinearly coupled oscillator model with a peculiar nonlinearity , originated by the soliton tail at the metal interface , which was considered as the driving mechanism for the coupling and the dynamical features of the soliplasmon system . despite the amount of undetermined coefficients in the model , relevant qualitative predictions of the soliplasmon properties were made .",
    "these nonlinear modes where later numerically demonstrated to exist in the context of the general vectorial nonlinear maxwell equations and the nonlinear oscillator model ( found with asymmetric coupling ) was presented with fully determined coefficients @xcite .",
    "however , that oscillator model was never proved .",
    "although the soliplasmon proposal is relatively recent , monochromatic surface waves in the vicinity of the interface between a nonlinear dielectric and a metal were extensively studied during the decade of the 80 s by many authors ( see , to cite only a few , @xcite ) . amongst those theoretical results , corrections to the profile and wavenumber of i )",
    "spp s due to nonlinearity and ii ) of the spatial solitons due to the presence of a metallic interface far from its core , were presented . at that time , none of the studies , to the best of our knowledge , considered simultaneously a spatial soliton and a spp ; the two component wave referred to as soliplasmon .",
    "recently , the model presented in @xcite has been extended in a first attempt to describe soliplasmons in the challenging and more realistic 2d geometry , consisting of several interfaces @xcite .",
    "so far the 2d symmetric like modes are reported , but the antisymmetric ones , which in principle require less power in the soliton component @xcite , remain unfound . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of nonlinear vector effects , generated by strong gradients of the effective nonlinearly induced refractive index , can be of relevance for understanding soliplasmon modes near resonance or with high plasmonic component , such as in metals directly attached to the nonlinear medium , so standard scalar soliton solutions can not be appropriate when they are too close to the interface and a full - vector soliton solution is required @xcite .    in this paper , we present the detailed derivation of the nonlinear oscillator model from first principles .",
    "we focus on 1d soliplasmons in two geometries of interest , namely the metal / kerr ( mk ) @xcite and the metal / dielectric / kerr ( mdk ) @xcite interfaces ( by _ dielectric _ we implicitly mean a linear dielectric and by a kerr dielectric with cubic nonlinearity ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we motivate and present our variational _",
    "ansatz _ and the main features of soliton - plasmon coupling in the general context of nonlinear maxwell s equations ; in section iii , we focus on the soliton component of the soliplasmon _ ansatz _ in the case of total decoupling and we obtain the dynamical equation for the soliton variational parameter ; in section iv , we obtain the equation for a general nonlinear plasmon stationary mode ( decoupled from soliton ) and construct the dynamical equation for the plasmon variational parameter .",
    "finally , in section v , we obtain the nonlinear resonator model for the coupled system formed by a nonlinear plasmon and a soliton in the weak coupling approximation . in section",
    "vi , we pay attention to the cases of a mk and mdk geometries previous mentioned recovering and demonstrating the model presented in refs.@xcite . in all sections , we stress the role played by the different approximations used in our derivation .",
    "the relevance and differences of this model with respect other approaches are especially emphasized in the conclusions .",
    "we consider the wave equation for the electric component of a monochromatic em field describing its propagation in an optical media characterized by inhomogeneous linear and nonlinear ( kerr ) susceptibilities .",
    "we take the most general form of these equations derived from maxwell s equations without assuming neither the scalar nor the paraxial approximations .",
    "thus , our starting point is :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the in - homogenous linear dielectric function and @xmath2    is the kerr nonlinear polarization , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the in - homogeneous third order susceptibilities associated to the kerr effect .",
    "all functions have an implicit , but undisplayed , dependence on the frequency of the nonlinear wave @xmath5 .",
    "our goal is to find a simplified , although physically meaningful , model describing the existence of soliton - plasmon resonances , or _ soliplasmons _ , obtained by the interaction of a spatial soliton of the kerr medium with a surface plasmon polariton ( spp ) on a metal / dielectric interface .",
    "we consider a simple configuration consisting in a spatial soliton moving ( within a kerr medium ) in parallel to a metal / dielectric interface interacting with a spp propagating on it ( see fig.[fig : mdk ] ) .",
    "it has been proven that stationary nonlinear states of this system in the form of soliton - plasmon resonances indeed exists as a solution of eq.([eq : nl_vector_wave_eq ] ) for this type of configuration @xcite .",
    "they show a structure in which the soliton and plasmon components are clearly distinguishable , which supports to adopt the following variational _ ansatz : @xmath6+\\mathbf{e}_{s}\\left[\\left\\ { c_{i}(z)\\right\\ } _ { i=1}^{n}\\right],\\label{eq : general_ansatz}\\ ] ] _ in which , in principle , we do not explicitly display the dependence on the variational parameters so that a multi - parametric dependence can be assumed .",
    "we will particularize these parameters later .",
    "we also allow the spp to behave nonlinearly by the effect of the kerr nonlinearity on its own propagation @xcite thus giving rise to what we call a nonlinear plasmon .",
    "we introduce the general _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : general_ansatz ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nl_vector_wave_eq ] ) to get : @xmath7 where we have taken into account that the soliton is essentially a scalar solution so that @xmath8 .",
    "we have also defined the differential operator @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transverse gradient operator .",
    "the term @xmath12 includes all nonlinear kerr terms coupling the spp and soliton components : @xmath13 the spp and soliton fields have different features .",
    "the spp , as a surface wave and even when it behaves nonlinearly , can only exist bounded to the metal / dielectric interface , its nature being purely vectorial .",
    "on the other hand , the soliton can move freely in the kerr medium with no restriction and its existence is due to the kerr nonlinearity and it is essentially a scalar wave .",
    "it is clear from physical arguments and from results in ref.@xcite that the coupling between these two entities vanishes as we move the soliton far way from the interface .",
    "in such a case , the overlapping of @xmath14 and @xmath15 tends to zero and , thus , @xmath16 . in the limiting case in which they are infinitely far away ,",
    "eq.([eq : nl_vector_wave_eq ] ) gives rise to two independent equations for @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 thus we can consider the action of @xmath20 as a perturbation that couples the solutions of these two independent equations .",
    "for this reason , in our variational approach we will first consider the situation in which the two previous equations are satisfied separately . we will write the variational equations for both components separately and then we introduce the first order correction originated by the coupling term @xmath20 .    ]",
    "we start by considering the equation of an uncoupled soliton field satisfying eq.([eq : soliton_wave_eq ] ) .",
    "we consider the simplest case by choosing the fundamental soliton solution as a variational _ ansatz _ and by taking a single variational parameter , namely , the soliton amplitude . in the planar geometry under consideration , as given by fig.[fig : mdk ] , we consider a @xmath21 and @xmath22 dependence only , so that the fundamental soliton corresponds to that of the 1d helmholtz equation .",
    "stationary _ solution has the _ sech _ form : @xmath23e^{i\\beta_{s}z}\\equiv\\mathbf{u}\\bar{e}_{s}(x;c)e^{i\\beta_{s}z},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , c\\in\\mathbb{r}^{+},\\,\\,\\ , a\\text{\\ensuremath{\\in}}\\mathbb{r}^{+},\\label{eq : helmholtz_soliton_solution}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a real unitary vector and the propagation constant of the soliton is given by @xmath26 @xmath27 being the linear dielectric constant of the kerr medium .",
    "it is easy to check that the expression ( [ eq : helmholtz_soliton_solution ] ) verifies : @xmath28\\bar{\\mathbf{e}}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\beta_{s}^{2}\\mathbf{\\bar{e}}_{\\mathrm{s}},\\label{eq : stationary_soliton_eq}\\ ] ] or , equivalently , eq.([eq : soliton_wave_eq ] ) for a stationary solution in which @xmath29 .",
    "now , we make the _ ansatz _ for the soliton component .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , for quasi - stationary evolution the dynamics of the soliton position @xmath30 is much slower than that of the amplitude .",
    "for this reason , we promote the soliton amplitude @xmath31 to the category of the only variational parameter for the case under consideration .",
    "therefore , we establish the _ ansatz _ as follows : @xmath32\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , c(z)\\in\\mathbb{c}.\\label{eq : soliton_ansatz}\\ ] ] our aim now is to find the dynamical equation for the variational parameter @xmath33 .",
    "we immediately recognize that the previous ansatz admits the following useful decomposition ( taking into account that we can write @xmath34 $ ] ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the stationary soliton solution characterized by the real and positive amplitude @xmath37@xmath38 and , consequently , by a propagation constant @xmath39 .",
    "since we are interested in quasi - stationary evolution , we will assume that the dynamics of @xmath37@xmath38 is much slower than that of the corresponding phase @xmath40 , so that , @xmath41 .",
    "this assumption is supported by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we substitute now the _ ansatz _ eq.([eq : soliton_ansatz ] ) into the soliton wave equation ( [ eq : soliton_wave_eq ] ) : @xmath42\\mathbf{e}_{s},\\ ] ] which can be written as @xmath43\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{s}}=0.\\label{eq : variational_eq_soliton}\\ ] ] but , since according to our _ ansatz , _",
    "@xmath44\\bar{e}_{s}(x , z)\\equiv\\mathbf{u}e_{s}(x , z)$ ] , we can see that the differential operator in brackets only acts on the stationary solution @xmath45 .",
    "since the latter field , on the other hand , satisfies the stationary equation ( [ eq : stationary_soliton_eq ] ) , this means that the variational field @xmath15 also fulfills @xmath46\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{s}}=\\beta_{s}^{2}\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{s}},\\label{eq : nl_eigenvalue_eq_varitional_soliton}\\ ] ] and , therefore , the previous equation becomes : @xmath47 at this point , we introduce another useful decomposition for the variational field ( [ eq : soliton_ansatz ] ) : @xmath37@xmath48 , where @xmath49.$ ] this decomposition permits to write the equation above as : @xmath50+\\beta_{s}^{2}\\left[c(z)f_{s}(x;|c(z)|\\right]=0.\\ ] ] in order to obtain a dynamical equation for @xmath33 , we need to project the previous equation with respect to a suitable function .",
    "a natural choice for the projection function is the stationary soliton solution at the initial propagation point , i.e. , @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath52 is constant , it disappears in the projection process , so that , after projection we have : @xmath53+\\beta_{s}^{2}\\left[c(z)\\int_{\\mathbb{r}}f_{s}\\left(x,0\\right)f_{s}(x;|c(z)|)\\right]=0.\\ ] ] we introduce now the notation @xmath54 and we immediately recognize that @xmath37the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath22 comes exclusively from its dependence on the modulus of the soliton amplitude @xmath38 .",

    "in the case of the nonlinear plasmon component , we follow a similar procedure as for the soliton case . however , equations are here more cumbersome to analyze since we have to deal with the vectorial part of the differential operator in the wave equation ( [ eq : nl_plasmon_wave_eq ] ) .",
    "another difference is that , since the spp is a surface wave , the linear dielectric function is no longer a constant , as for the soliton equation , but rather a function defining the dielectric / metal interface : @xmath58 a nonlinear plasmon is a stationary solution of eq.([eq : nl_plasmon_wave_eq ] ) of the form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 stands for the transverse components of the electric field .",
    "we will consider that the nonlinear plasmon stationary solution is a conservative soliton .",
    "this means that for the stationary solution we will assume that the system has no losses , neither linear nor nonlinear , so that @xmath61 will be a real function . for the same reason",
    ", we will take real nonlinear susceptibilities ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the complex character of a realistic @xmath37@xmath61 will be taken into account when we set the dynamical equations for the variational solution .    according to eq.([eq : nl_plasmon_wave_eq ] ) , the transverse components of the nonlinear plasmon solution verify : @xmath63.\\label{eq : nl_plasmon_eq_transverse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the linear case , the transverse components of the electric field corresponding to the eigenmodes of an axially - invariant system can be chosen to be real functions ( @xmath37@xmath64 ) whereas the axial ones are pure imaginary ( @xmath65 ) @xcite .",
    "as we will see next , this choice is also consistent in the nonlinear vector case . assuming these properties for the electric field",

    "the reason is the dependence of both @xmath75 and @xmath76 on @xmath77 as well . in the most general case",
    ", the solution of the nonlinear vector problem requires to solve the transverse equation ( [ eq : nl_plasmon_eq_transverse ] ) @xmath37 along with the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the form of the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) also demonstrates the consistency of the assumptions with respect the real character of transverse components and the pure imaginary condition for the axial one .",
    "indeed , this constraint shows that if @xmath78 automatically @xmath77 becomes a pure imaginary function .",
    "this is so since we are considering @xmath61 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 to be real , so that @xmath37@xmath75 and @xmath76 also are .    in many situations , despite the stationary eigenmodes have an hybrid nature , the axial component is commonly remarkably smaller than the transverse one .",
    "so that , we can reasonably consider in many circumstances that @xmath81 .",
    "we refer to this condition as the _ quasi - transverse approximation _ and , in practice , it will implemented by neglecting terms which are second order in the axial component , i.e. , @xmath82 .",
    "when the quasi - transverse approximation is considered , the nonlinear vector eigenmode can be described by two nonlinear effective functions depending only on transverse components : @xmath83 in this approximation , transverse and axial components decouple in the equation for @xmath84 eq.([eq : nl_plasmon_eq_transverse ] ) since , according to the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) , it is verified that @xmath85 the previous equation permits , after substitution into eq.([eq : nl_plasmon_eq_transverse ] ) , to eliminate the axial component completely from the transverse equation . @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 being the nonlinearly - induced anisotropy function .",
    "note that due to the quasi - transverse approximation , @xmath75 and @xmath89 depend on transverse components exclusively .",
    "despite this fact , it is important to remark that in this approximation axial components are _ nonzero .",
    "_ they are simply decoupled from the transverse ones .",
    "they can be obtained in a simple way from the constraint ( [ eq : contraint_transverse_approx ] ) once the problem have been solved for the transverse components . unlike for the general case ,",
    "the constraint becomes now an explicit expression of @xmath77 as a function of @xmath84 . from the computational point of view",
    ", the decoupling of axial and transverse components considerably simplifies the calculation of the stationary solution since , then , the simultaneous self - consistent resolution of the transverse equation and the constraint can be circumvented .    up to now ,",
    "all the analysis is valid for a general linear dielectric function profile @xmath61 which does not need to be necessarily that of a spp on a metal / dielectric interface .",
    "this means that results can be applied to arbitrary axially - invariant structures even in 2d .",
    "however , since we are interested in the case of a spp on a planar structure ( fig.[fig : mdk ] ) , we will assume that we deal with a 1d nonlinear plasmon in a tm configuration .",
    "the corresponding electric field has then the form @xmath90 and thus the transverse vector has no component in the @xmath91 direction @xmath92 .",
    "on the other hand , as in every tm mode , @xmath93 and @xmath77 depend on the @xmath21 coordinate exclusively .",
    "the equation we obtained in the quasi - transverse approximation ( [ eq : nl_equation_only_transverse ] ) becomes then a single equation for the @xmath21 component @xmath94 in which there is no dependence in the @xmath91 direction .",
    "remarkably , there are some cases for which there exists an analytical solution .",
    "that is the case of a planar metal / kerr structure @xcite .",
    "the general form of a solution of the stationary transverse problem ( [ eq : nl_equation_only_transverse ] ) for a tm mode with only @xmath21 component has to be analogous to that of the soliton field in the previous section : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the nonlinear plasmon amplitude . as for the soliton case , we choose it to be the peak value for @xmath93 ( @xmath97 ) whereas @xmath98 plays the role of the _ sech _ function__. _ _ inasmuch the transverse equation only depends on @xmath93 and not on @xmath77 we only have a dependence on @xmath96 and not on the amplitude of the axial component . in the general case of a tm mode with coupled axial and transverse components we would have instead : @xmath99    in our case , since we are applying the quasi - transverse approximation , we keep the dependence on @xmath96 exclusively .",
    "it will be this coefficient the only one that we will promote to variational parameter . in order to select our variational _ ansatz _ we proceed analogously as for the soliton field in the previous section .",
    "we transform the stationary solution @xmath100 into the variational _ ansatz _ @xmath101 according to the following rule : @xmath102 it must be clear now that once the stationary problem has been solved _ _ for all values of @xmath96 ( a prerequisite that must be fulfilled _",
    "prior _ to the analysis of the variational equations ) , the function @xmath98 in eq.([eq : plasmon_ansatz ] ) is perfectly known for a given value of @xmath103 . in some particular cases , such as in ref.@xcite",
    "it is even possible to provide an analytical expression for the stationary solution and , consequently , also for @xmath98 .    as before ,",
    "we now introduce the _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : plasmon_ansatz ] ) into the _ dynamical _ nonlinear plasmon equation for the @xmath21 component ( [ eq : nl_plasmon_wave_eq ] ) to obtain , in the quasi - transverse approximation : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the linear dielectric function profile of the metal / dielectric interface , as in eq.([eq : dielectric_function_md_interface ] ) .",

    "in the two previous sections we projected the two uncoupled equations for the soliton and plasmon variational fields using suitable soliton and plasmon projection functions for each case . here , we will make an identical choice for the projecting functions and we will make two different projections of eq.([eq : nl_equation_variational_field_soliplasmon ] ) .",

    "note that these nonlinear terms are different from those owned by the nonlinear plasmon and soliton when they are decoupled . in the absence of coupling ,",

    "the plasmon propagation constant @xmath313 is now that of a stationary nonlinear plasmon and it depends on the spp amplitude @xmath220 .",
    "the analytic form of @xmath135 on @xmath220 is know only in some cases @xcite . in the general case , @xmath314 is nothing but the eigenvalue of the nonlinear equation for the electric components of the nonlinear spp field ( [ eq : nl_equation_only_transverse ] ) .",
    "as explained in section [ sec : variational_equation_for_nl_plasmon ] , the nonlinear terms in this equation depend nonlinearly on the plasmon amplitude as @xmath315 .",
    "so that , @xmath316 and we can always perform a taylor expansion in @xmath315 : @xmath317 we are interested here in the first order nonlinear corrections to the linear case , so that we keep the first correction only and neglect @xmath318 terms .",
    "consequently , to leading order in the weak coupling approximation and to first order in @xmath315 , we have @xmath319 we can write the previous equation in a form that resemble that of a linear plasmon in eq.([eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters_weak_coupling-1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath320a & = - & \\frac{\\ensuremath{\\bar{\\delta}}_{ps}\\left(|a|,|c|\\right)}{n_{\\mathrm{np}}}c\\nonumber \\\\ \\left[\\frac{d^{2}}{dz^{2}}+\\beta_{s}^{2}\\left(|c|\\right)\\right]c & = & 0,\\label{eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters_mk_bis}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now @xmath321 note that the effective propagation constant is now a complex number @xmath322 because of the nonlinear @xmath323 coupling .",
    "thus the nonlinear soliton - to - plasmon coupling simultaneously affects both the phase velocity of the nonlinear plasmon and the plasmon amplitude , due to the presence of a nonzero _ gain - loss _ coefficient proportional to the imaginary part of the effective propagation constant : @xmath324 in general .",
    "there is also a nonlinear plasmonic modification of the coupling coefficient @xmath244 in eq.([eq : renormalized_beta_delta_nl_plasmon ] ) that can slightly modify the nature of the coupling with respect the pure mdk case .",
    "these two effects are _ additional _ to those associated to the @xmath96-independent coefficient @xmath37@xmath325 appearing in the case of the linear - plasmon / soliton coupling in a mdk structure @xcite .",
    "we see that , at this order of the weak coupling approximation , the soliton equation decouples from the plasmon one . physically speaking",
    ", the soliton acts as a non - depleting reservoir pumping the non - linear plasmon without experience any energy exchange with the spp .",
    "obviously , this is only true within the order of our approximation because we have truncated higher - order terms .",
    "indeed , there exists this type of energy exchange from the plasmon to the soliton but this has to fulfill two conditions : ( i ) , it has to be very small , i.e. , in mathematical terms is has to be at least @xmath326 since this is the order of terms neglected in our weak coupling approximation ; and ( ii ) , it necessarily has to arise from terms neglected in the process of deriving the variational equations at leading order , since the leading order plasmon - to - soliton coupling for a mk structure , linked to variations in the linear dielectric functions , is strictly zero inasmuch @xmath327 .",
    "so , we would need to go to next - to - leading order in the weak coupling approximation if we wanted to account for these effects .",
    "this generalization to next - to - leading order is certainly more complicated because we need to include terms that we have neglected in previous analysis .",
    "if we keep all the approximations to the same order , as before , and we only go to the next order in the weak coupling approximation , we need to consider the four terms in the kerr coupling @xmath149 defined in eq.([eq : general_kerr_coupling ] ) .",
    "we have to retained now the first two terms .",
    "we neglected them before because they provided terms @xmath326 that we want to keep now .",
    "the plasmon and soliton projections provide two more terms linked to them . the plasmonic projection ( [ eq : plasmonic_projection ] ) is now : @xmath328+\\delta_{ps}\\left[\\frac{d^{2}}{dz^{2}}c+\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}}^{2}c\\right ] & = & -\\triangle_{pp}a-\\triangle_{ps}c\\\\   &   & \\hspace{-3cm}-\\triangle_{\\mathrm{k}}\\left[2|a|^{2}c+a^{2}c^{*}\\right]-\\gamma_{\\mathrm{k}}\\left[2|c|^{2}a+c^{2}a^{*}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] whereas the soliton projection reads ( [ eq : soliton_projection ] ) @xmath329+n_{s}\\left[\\frac{d^{2}}{dz^{2}}c+\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}}^{2}c\\right ] & = & -\\triangle_{ss}c-\\triangle_{sp}a\\\\   &   & \\hspace{-3cm}-\\triangle'_{\\mathrm{k}}\\left[2|a|^{2}c+a^{2}c^{*}\\right]-\\gamma'_{\\mathrm{k}}\\left[2|c|^{2}a+c^{2}a^{*}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced two new kerr coupling coefficients : @xmath330 however , since @xmath327 , we know that their two projections vanish , so that , @xmath331 and @xmath332 . if we follow now the demonstration given in section [ sec : variational_eq_for_soliplasmon ] , we can conclude that the form of the generalized equation ( [ eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters ] ) has to be substituted by a new one including the new kerr - coupling terms and in which @xmath333 ( from its definition eq.([eq : q_linear_coefficients ] ) along with @xmath331 and @xmath332 ) : @xmath334 where we have introduced the new nonlinear coefficients @xmath335 we see that , as expected , despite there is no trace of _ linear _ plasmon - to - soliton coupling , nonlinear coupling occurs in the next - to - leading order weak coupling approximation .",
    "it is revealing to consider the case of a very weak plasmon field , in which we are approaching the linear plasmon limit and thus terms @xmath37@xmath241 can be neglected in eq.([eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters_general ] ) : @xmath336 the previous equation makes clear that there is a second mechanism for plasmon - to - soliton coupling absent at leading order .",
    "soliton can be also pumped or depleted by the plasmon field through a mechanism based on the kerr coupling terms in eq.([eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters_small_a ] ) .",
    "these terms can be understood as nonlinear sources generating gain or loss on the soliton parameter @xmath31 and driven by the plasmon field .",
    "as before , this mechanism can be visualized by renormalizing the soliton propagation constant in the following way :    @xmath337 which permits to write the soliton equation as : @xmath338 analogously as in a previous analysis , the imaginary part of the renormalized propagation constant give us essential information about this nonlinear mechanism @xmath339 which indicates that this type of term generates nonlinear gain or loss depending on the value of the soliplasmon relative phase .",
    "another way of understanding the physical nature of the plasmon - to - soliton nonlinear term ( the one proportional to @xmath340 ) in eq.([eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters_small_a ] ) , and more specifically the one depending on @xmath341 , is by considering that its origin is the _ nonlinear _ modulation of the dielectric function in the kerr medium .",
    "we know that the absence of _ linear _ modulation ( @xmath327 ) makes the plasmon - to - soliton linear coupling to vanish .",
    "however , even if there is no linear modulation in the region where the soliton is localized ( we assume an homogeneous nonlinear dielectric medium ) , the kerr effect does induce a nonlinear modulation of the refractive index or , equivalently , of the dielectric function @xmath342 .",
    "therefore , there exists , in fact , an effective modulation of @xmath343 induced by the kerr nonlinearity that , in turn , originates a local variation of the dielectric function for the plasmon field , as defined in eq.([eq : local_variation_dielectric_function_plasmon ] ) , given by @xmath344 since this term is nonzero , an effective plasmon - to - soliton variational coupling , analogous to the linear one @xmath245 ( eq.([eq : soliton_projection_integral ] ) ) , is expected ( recall that the linear coefficient vanish , @xmath331 ) @xmath345 the previous variational term corresponds to the soliton projection of @xmath346 .",
    "one recognizes that this term is responsible of the first term of the @xmath340 coefficient in eq.([eq : p_k_coefficients ] ) .",
    "this term can be interpreted as the leading order effect of soliton - soliton interaction in the weak coupling regime . in this case , the nonlinear plasmon , acting as a soliton , couples to the soliton tail though its own asymptotic exponential tail by means of the kerr term .",
    "the soliton - soliton interaction exists independently of the existence of a linear modulation and , therefore , occurs even in a completely homogeneous medium . for this reason",
    ", it is expected to exist even if the soliton moves in a completely homogeneous medium , as in the present case in which we deal with a mk structure .",
    "analogously , the nonlinear self - modulated local variation of the dielectric function @xmath346 generates also a next - to - leading order coupling through its plasmon projection , which physically can be interpreted as generated by a nonlinearly induced term @xmath347 of the type given in eq.([eq : delta_pp_coefficient ] ) ( recall that there is no linear counterpart of this term since @xmath332 ) : @xmath348 this coupling coefficient generates the second term in the expression for @xmath340 ( [ eq : delta_pp_coefficient ] ) .",
    "we have introduced a variational approach to properly understand the physics behind the problem of the nonlinear excitation of a spp by a spatial soliton . unlike in the original proposal in ref.@xcite",
    ", the resulting nonlinear resonator model is obtained from first principles , which permits , in this way , to provide an approximate solution of the full vector maxwell s wave equation ( [ eq : nl_vector_wave_eq ] ) for configurations close to our soliplasmon _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : soliplasmon_ansatz ] ) . in physical terms ,",
    "variational equations extract the most relevant information of soliplasmon resonances as bound states of a soliton and a linear or nonlinear spp .",
    "they provide the dynamics of a spp and a soliton propagating along a metal / dielectric interface in the presence of a continuous exchange of electromagnetic energy between them in a process controlled by a nonlinear coupling constant , which is proportional to the soliton field at the interface @xmath349 ( see eq.([q_paraxial ] ) ) .",
    "since the inverse soliton penetration length @xmath350 depends nonlinearly on the soliton amplitude , even the simpler case of a soliton bounded to a linear spp presents special features with respect other well - know nonlinear resonator models @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that soliplasmon resonances exists even in the presence of a low power spp component , i.e , a linear spp , demonstrates that nonlinearities in a soliplasmon play also a supplementary role than the one that is commonly attributed to them in nonlinear plasmonics .",
    "the fact that spp s can support very high intensities very close to the metal / nonlinear - dielectric interface is the origin of most of the nonlinear effects reported in the literature .",
    "they are responsible of generation of second harmonic ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) but also of nonlinearities of the kerr type .",
    "they are known as early as in the 80 s @xcite .",
    "more recently , substantial advances in the field of plasmonics have refreshed the possibility of exploiting these effects for nanophotonics applications using available technology , so a renovated interest in nonlinear effects induced by kerr materials interacting with metals have been reflected in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the high intensities reached in the dielectric in the vicinity of the metal interface associated to a high - power spp mode are able to enhance the nonlinear response of a kerr medium directly attached to the metal .",
    "this response can , in return , modify the propagation properties of the spp . as pointed out as early as in ref.@xcite , `` when nonlinear dielectric media are in contact with a metal surface , the surface plasmon polaritons guided by that interface become power - dependent . ''",
    "this can be considered a standard definition of a nonlinear plasmon .",
    "the fact that the propagation constant of the spp becomes power - dependent explicitly shows that , according to this definition of a nonlinear plasmon , the latter is continuously connected to the linear spp in a standard @xmath351 _ vs _ @xmath352 representation . from this perspective , soliplasmons are not nonlinear plasmons since their resonant nature forces their two branches corresponding to 0- and @xmath353- soliplasmon solutions to be detached from that of a linear spp in a @xmath351 _ vs _ @xmath352 representation ( see its resonant behavior in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "physically , in a soliplasmon , plasmon and soliton preserve their identity as localized solutions even though they are interacting . in a nonlinear plasmon",
    ", the soliton can not be resolved as a second spatially localized component .",
    "our variational approach for a soliplasmon formalizes this features explicitly by assuming the existence of two separately localized plasmon and soliton components in our _ ansatz _ ( [ eq : general_ansatz ] ) . in this way",
    ", our variational equations distinguish between two different types of nonlinear effects : ( i ) those affecting the _ uncoupled _ propagation of the plasmon and soliton components , i.e , those which appear even when they do not interact ; and ( ii ) those related to the interaction . in the case of the spp ,",
    "the former are taken into account in our variational formalism through the dependence of the plasmon propagation constant @xmath316 on the spp amplitude .",
    "this is analogous to the well - known behavior of the soliton propagation constant with respect to its amplitude : @xmath354 .",
    "the second type of nonlinear effects are related to coupling . here",
    "we can , in turn , distinguish two different categories .",
    "the first one is related to typical soliton - to - soliton coupling , as those appearing in eqs.([eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_mk ] ) or ( [ eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters_small_a ] ) , which show a form analogous to cross - phase modulation @xcite .",
    "the second one is related to the modulation of the linear dielectric function and it is the analogous to the coupling between neighboring atoms in a crystal in the so - called _ tight binding approximation _",
    "the coupling here is giving by the overlapping of the wave functions of two solutions of individual atomic sites detached from one another weighted by the difference of the total periodic potential with respect the atomic one .",
    "this is the nature of the coupling terms @xmath245 and @xmath244 involving the local variations of the linear dielectric function @xmath154 and @xmath155 in eqs.([eq : plasmon_projection_integrals ] ) and ( [ eq : soliton_projection_integral ] ) .",
    "this is in fact the dominant coupling term in the weak coupling approximation , as demonstrated by our variational equations for the interaction of a linear plasmon and a soliton ( [ eq : variational_eq_soliplasmon_parameters_weak_coupling-1 ] ) .",
    "however , since the overlapping solutions are in this case nonlinear ( in this case , that of the the soliton ) , the coupling becomes itself nonlinear .",
    "it is precisely this second type of nonlinearity in the coupling what causes the soliplasmon variational model to be qualitatively different from other coupled nonlinear systems @xcite .",
