    "the study of nuclei with equal numbers of neutrons and protons ( @xmath2 ) is one of the declared goals of radioactive - ion - beam facilities , either in operation or under construction .",
    "such nuclei are well known when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are small but , as the atomic mass number @xmath10 increases , they lie increasingly closer to the proton drip line and therefore become more difficult to study experimentally .",
    "nevertheless , several phenomena of interest , such as the breaking of isospin symmetry or the emergence of new collective modes of excitation , are predicted to become more pronounced with increasing @xmath11 , and this constitutes the main argument for undertaking the difficult studies of ever more heavier @xmath2 nuclei .    arguably , the goal of most interest in this quest is the uncovering of effects due to isoscalar ( @xmath1 ) neutron - proton ( n - p ) pairing .",
    "in contrast to the usual isovector ( @xmath12 ) pairing , where the orbital angular momenta and the spins of two nucleons are both antiparallel ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) , isoscalar pairing requires the spins of the nucleons to be parallel ( @xmath15 ) , resulting in a total angular momentum @xmath16 .",
    "collective correlation effects are predicted to occur as a result of isoscalar n - p pairing  @xcite but have resisted so far experimental confirmation because ( i ) the @xmath17 coupling scheme which is applicable in all but the lightest nuclei disfavors the formation of isoscalar n - p pairs with @xmath13  @xcite , and ( ii ) the states associated with this collective mode are of low angular momentum @xmath6 and often hidden among high-@xmath6 isomeric states which hinders their experimental detection .",
    "currently , @xmath2 experiments are approaching @xmath18sn , involving studies of nuclei such as @xmath5pd  @xcite where nucleons are dominantly confined to the @xmath19 orbit . in the context of these experiments , blomqvist recently proposed  @xcite that a realistic description of shell - model wave functions can be obtained in terms of isoscalar n - p pairs which are completely _ aligned _ in angular momentum , that is , pairs with @xmath0 .",
    "this proposal is attractive since it is well adapted to the @xmath17 coupling scheme , valid in this mass region , and because it should encompass the description of high-@xmath6 isomeric states .",
    "blomqvist s idea is related to the so - called stretch scheme which was advocated a long time ago by danos and gillet  @xcite . in the stretch scheme ,",
    "shell - model states are constructed from aligned n - p pairs , treated in a quasi - boson approximation which neglects antisymmetry between the nucleons in different pairs .",
    "the latter approximation is absent from blomqvist s approach .",
    "in this paper we examine blomqvist s proposal for the @xmath2 nuclei @xmath3cd , @xmath4ag , and @xmath5pd .",
    "we consider several realistic two - body interactions for the @xmath19 orbit and analyze the shell - model wave functions , obtained with these interactions , of the four - nucleon - hole system ( @xmath3cd ) , in terms of a variety two - pair states .",
    "for the six- and eight - hole nuclei ( @xmath4ag and @xmath5pd ) a direct shell - model analysis in terms of pair states is more difficult , and we prefer therefore to carry out an indirect check by means of a mapping to a corresponding boson model . in these cases",
    "our approach is intermediate between that of blomqvist  @xcite and of danos and gillet  @xcite .",
    "the boson mapping takes care of antisymmetry effects in an exact manner on the level of four nucleons but becomes approximate for more .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , some necessary concepts and techniques are introduced : the formulas needed to carry out a shell - model calculation in a pair basis are given in sect .",

    "this section summarizes the necessary ingredients to carry out calculations in an isospin formalism .",
    "the formulas given are valid for fermions as well as for bosons .",
    "four - particle states are described by grouping the particles in two pairs .",
    "these two - pair states can be used , for example , as a basis in a shell - model calculation , facilitating the subsequent analysis of the pair structure of the eigenstates .",
    "furthermore , the two - pair representation of four - particle states is the natural basis to map the shell model onto a corresponding model in terms of bosons .",
    "once this mapping is carried out , the original interacting fermion problem is reduced to one of interacting bosons , which can also be solved with the results summarized in this section .    in the pair representation of four particles with angular momentum @xmath20 and isospin @xmath21 ( both integer for bosons and half - odd - integer for fermions )",

    "the two - particles isospin @xmath7 ( obtained by coupling @xmath57 with @xmath57 ) is _ not _ redundant but is needed to fully characterize the two - particle state .",
    "the basic and common idea of different boson mapping methods is to truncate the full shell - model space to a subspace which is written in terms of fermion pairs and to establish subsequently a correspondence between the fermion - pair space and an analogous space which is written in terms of bosons .",
    "this section recalls briefly two methods , namely the oai ( otsuka - arima - iachello )  @xcite and the democratic  @xcite mappings that will be used in the applications .",
    "we limit ourselves here to the problem of @xmath58 nucleons with isospin @xmath54 in a single orbit @xmath20 which is the case of interest in this paper .",

    "the pair  ( [ e_pair ] ) is totally determined by its angular momentum @xmath6 and its isospin follows from it ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath1 for odd @xmath6 and @xmath12 for even @xmath6 ) .",
    "the starting point of the oai mapping is a given shell - model hamiltonian @xmath63 which is a scalar in @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the selection of a number of fermion pairs @xmath64 , to each of which will be associated a boson with the same angular momentum @xmath36 .",

    "the one - body term of the mapped boson hamiltonian @xmath68 is directly obtained from the matrix elements of the shell - model hamiltonian @xmath67 between the pair states , @xmath69 these matrix elements are interpreted as single - boson energies .",
    "the determination of higher - body terms of the mapped boson hamiltonian is more complicated , as we illustrate here for the two - body part . for a given angular momentum @xmath6 and isospin @xmath7 ,",

    "the strategy of the oai mapping is to define for each @xmath25 a _ hierarchy _ of pair states , to apply a gram - schmidt _ orthogonalization _ of this ordered sequence , and to associate the boson states with the _ orthonormalized _ fermion states .",

    "one has the series @xmath80 until @xmath81 , with @xmath82 an efficient algorithm to carry out the gram - schmidt procedure involves expanding the orthonormal states @xmath83 in the non - orthogonal basis @xmath84 as @xmath85 and calculating the coefficients @xmath86 ( needed for @xmath87 ) recursively from @xmath88 which as only input requires the knowledge of the overlap matrix elements @xmath77 .",
    "the matrix elements of the fermion hamiltonian in the orthonormal basis @xmath83 are then given by @xmath89 and the mapped boson hamiltonian follows from @xmath90 note that this equation defines the entire boson hamiltonian up to and including two - body interactions .",

    "this is the version of the oai mapping as it will be applied in this paper .",
    "the boson hamiltonian is obtained from the two- and four - particle systems and is kept constant for systems with higher numbers of particles .",
    "this is akin to the democratic mapping but the latter has the advantage that no hierarchy of two - pair states is required , as is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "nevertheless , the hierarchy imposed in the oai mapping is often based on arguments of seniority which enables an extension to @xmath58-particle systems . to illustrate this point , we consider the case of a truncation onto a subspace constructed out of pairs of angular momenta @xmath95 ( @xmath96 pair ) and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 pair ) .",

    "its effect is a projection onto a subspace with seniority @xmath108 , the number of particles not in pairs coupled to @xmath95 . as a result",

    "the advantage of this procedure is that it determines a boson hamiltonian which varies with particle number yielding a more adequate description of pauli effects .",
    "its disadvantage is that a generalization towards any choice of pairs and/or to neutrons and protons is difficult , if not impossible .",

    "in fact , the energies obtained in @xmath156-ibm ( both with the oai and democratic mappings ) agree well with those of the shell - model levels except for ( i ) the @xmath176 level in the four - hole system , ( ii ) low-@xmath6 levels of the six - hole system , and ( iii ) levels with @xmath184 to 16 in the six - hole system .",
    "the first discrepancy is obviously related to the small overlap of the @xmath176 shell - model state with @xmath185 , noted in table  [ t_g9 ] and explained in sect .",
    "[ ss_sma ] .",
    "the second difference is also understandable since a correct description of the low-@xmath6 states in the odd - odd nucleus @xmath4ag requires the consideration of low-@xmath6 pairs with @xmath1 which have been omitted from the present mapping .",
    "the third deviation could be related to an unfavorable coupling of three @xmath182 pairs to the angular momenta @xmath184 , 15 , and 16 , akin to the coupling of two @xmath182 pairs to @xmath176 .",
    "the results as regards e2 transitions are consistent with what is concluded from the analysis of spectra .",
    "we have shown in this paper that part of the low - energy spectroscopy of @xmath2 nuclei which have their valence nucleons confined to a single high-@xmath20 orbit , can be represented in terms of an aligned isoscalar n - p @xmath182 pair with @xmath186 and is further improved by the inclusion of an isovector @xmath96 pair coupled to @xmath95 .",
    "this was proven explicitly for a four - hole system and indirectly , through a mapping onto a corresponding boson system , for six and eight holes .",
    "some deficiencies were found in this approach .",
    "a first concerns states of the four - hole system with angular momentum @xmath187 which turn out to be poorly approximated with just @xmath96 and @xmath182 pairs .",
    "a second deficiency is more generic and pertains to the low-@xmath6 states in odd - odd @xmath2 nuclei , the description of which calls for the inclusion of isoscalar n - p pairs with low angular momentum .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the two isomers that have been observed so far in @xmath4ag , @xmath188 and @xmath189 , are adequately described in terms of @xmath155 bosons .",
    "these results were obtained for the @xmath19 orbit and for three different choices of two - body interaction . to what extent are they valid in general and",
    "can they be considered as representative of a system of neutrons and protons confined to a high-@xmath20 orbit ?",
    "in essence , two ingredients , geometry and dynamics , determine the outcome of the present pair analysis .",
    "the geometry is defined by the cfps and , provided @xmath20 is not too small , is expected to evolve only slowly with @xmath20 .",
    "( it would in fact be an exercise of some interest to perform the pair analysis in the limit of large @xmath20 . )",
    "the dynamics is determined by the two - body interaction which in our study was varied significantly but within reasonable bounds .",
    "the matrix elements shown in table  [ t_me ] are typical of what is obtained for a residual interaction with a short - range , attractive character  @xcite and we may thus expect similar results when we move to orbits other than @xmath19 .    this work calls for further studies . the pair analysis of the shell - model wave functions should be extended to higher particle numbers which can be achieved through an isospin - invariant formulation of the nucleon - pair shell model .",
    "consequently , the present results require further confirmation at higher particle number but one is tempted to conclude at this point that a realistic model can be formulated in terms of @xmath114 and @xmath155 bosons . due to its simplicity ,",
    "such a model could be of use to elucidate the main structural features of @xmath190 nuclei in this mass region .",
    "these topics are currently under study .",
    "we wish to thank stefan heinze for his help with the numerical calculations with arbmodel and aurore dijon for her help with the shell - model calculations .",
    "this work has been carried out in the framework of cnrs / def project n 19848 .",
    "thanks the algerian ministry of high education and scientific research for financial support .",
