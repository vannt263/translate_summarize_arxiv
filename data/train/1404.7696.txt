    "it often occurs in nature that a continuous symmetry of a system is not preserved in the ground state .",
    "such a spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) is ubiquitous in nature from magnetism , superfluidity and superconductivity to quantum field theories such as unification of fundamental forces .",
    "when such a ssb occurs , there must appear gapless modes known as nambu - goldstone modes ( ngms ) and low - energy physics is solely determined by these degrees of freedom .",
    "it is generally known that dispersion relations of ngms are always linear in relativistic theories .",
    "however , the situation is different in non - relativistic systems ; the dispersion relation can be either linear @xmath1 or quadratic @xmath2 . also , the number of ngms coincides with the number of generators of broken symmetries in relativistic theories , but such a relation does not exist in general for non - relativistic cases . the well - known illustrative examples in condensed matter physics are the heisenberg ferromagnets and antiferromagnets . in both cases ,",
    "the hamiltonian has the @xmath3 spin - rotation symmetry , but that of ground states is reduced to @xmath4 , ignoring discrete symmetries .",
    "so , the number of broken continuous symmetries is given by @xmath5 for both cases .",
    "however , the type and the number of emergent ngms are different ; while we have only one spin precession mode with quadratic dispersion in the ferromagnetic case , two spin - wave excitations with linear dispersion appear in the antiferromagnetic case .",
    "thus , the question is : how should we determine the number of ngms having linear and quadratic dispersions in non - relativistic systems ?    the first attack to the above - mentioned problem",
    "was made by nielsen and chadha in 1976 .",
    "they classified ngms with linear and quadratic dispersion relations to be of type - i and type - ii , respectively , and summarized the numbers of those modes in the form of the nielsen - chadha inequality @xcite .",
    "( strictly speaking , they defined type - i ( ii ) by a dispersion relation with an odd ( even ) power of the momentum , but this classification is not essential in view of today s understanding . ) after that , in the 21st century , following a novel remark by nambu @xcite , watanabe and brauner conjectured that the equality of the nielsen - chadha inequality is saturated in generic situation and gave a criterion to the numbers of type - i and type - ii ngms in the form of a matrix , which we call the watanabe - brauner ( wb ) matrix , whose components are commutators of generators corresponding to broken symmetries , sandwiched by the ground state @xcite .",
    "more recently , this conjecture has been proved by the effective lagrangian approach on a coset space @xcite and by mori s projection operator method @xcite . in particular , the effective lagrangian approach based on a coset space @xmath6 for a symmetry @xmath7 spontaneously broken down to its subgroup @xmath8 in the ground state @xcite is a very powerful tool to determine the low energy dynamics solely from symmetry arguments , and was extensively used in refs .",
    "these theoretical developments are now in the stage of experimental verification , because various kinds of multicomponent bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are realized in ultra cold atomic gases , such as binary mixtures @xcite and spinor becs @xcite with spin-1 @xcite , spin-2 @xcite , and spin-3 @xcite .",
    "for example , the dispersion relations of the bogoliubov phonon and the ferromagnetic spin wave are confirmed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "thus far , the theory was formulated for internal symmetries .",
    "the number of ngms and their dispersion relations are more complicated when spacetime symmetry such as translations and rotations are spontaneously broken .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent discussions .",
    "spacetime symmetries are also spontaneously broken in topologically non - trivial backgrounds , such as a quantized vortex @xcite , a domain wall in magnets @xcite , and in two - component becs @xcite and a skyrmion line in magnets @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "there appear ngms localized on / along topological objects .",
    "the equality in refs .",
    "@xcite holds even in these cases , but a careful treatment of the singularities in the core of topological excitations is needed to derive non - commutative nature of generators .    while the effective lagrangian approach in the coset space @xmath6 used in refs .",
    "@xcite can generally find possible terms by symmetry considerations , an explicit value of the coefficient of dispersion relations can be obtained only by solving each system concretely .",
    "furthermore , the coset space can not describe the deviation of the order parameter from ground states , so it can not grasp a correct physical picture for the motions of ngms .",
    "for example , the spin-1 polar bec , which is a non - magnetic phase of the spin-1 bec , has two type - i spin - wave excitations .",
    "these excitations induce a small magnetization and hence the order parameter deviates from the polar state @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "this effect is completely ignored if the description is closed in the coset space , because the phase of the order parameter is fixed .",
    "the similar situation also occurs in heisenberg antiferromagnets . in order to include these effects",
    ", we must formulate the theory in a full order - parameter space .",
    "also , the theories so far do not include gapless modes without an origin of ssb .",
    "for example , the theory can not deal with quasi - ngms @xcite appearing when the order parameter manifold is larger than the symmetry of lagrangian or hamiltonian .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate a theory of counting rule and dispersion relations for ngms by the standard gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) and bogoliubov theories @xcite , and settle the above - mentioned remaining problems .",
    "compared to earlier formulations , our theory will be more down - to - earth and easy - to - access , since we do not need a sophisticated modern geometry .",
    "though we illustrate our formulation by the specific multi - component gp model , our formalism can be extended to more general systems .",
    "+ here we overview the formalism of this paper .",
    "let us consider the @xmath9-component bose - condensed systems in @xmath10-dimensional spatial dimension , where the order parameter is given by @xmath11 .",

    "\\label{eq : intro105 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this inner product naturally arises from the bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field operators .",

    "are called a _",
    "@xmath26-inner product _ and _ @xmath26-orthogonality_. they play a crucially important role to classify ngms .",

    "however , we believe that our result will be more useful and general , because we can apply this method even for    a.   the case of spacetime symmetry breaking _ without any modification_. in particular , we do not need a sensitive mathematical treatment for cores of topological excitations to derive the central extension of a lie algebra and non - commutativity of translation operators @xcite .",
