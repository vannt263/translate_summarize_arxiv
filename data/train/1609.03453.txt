    "in dwarf novae , mass is transferred from a late - type star ( the secondary ) to a companion white dwarf ( wd ) via an accretion disc .",
    "they show recurrent outbursts on timescales of days - months , in which the disc brightens by factors 20 - 100 for @xmath2 days .",
    "outbursts are explained in terms of either a thermal - viscous disc - instability model ( dim , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a mass - transfer instability model ( mtim , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "dim predicts matter accumulates in a low viscosity , where @xmath3 is the non - dimensional viscosity parameter , @xmath4 is the local sound speed and @xmath5 is the disc scaleheight . ]",
    "disc during quiescence ( @xmath6 ) which switches to a high - viscosity regime during outbursts , whereas in mtim the disc viscosity is always the same ( @xmath7 , from the decline timescale of outbursting dwarf novae , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , estimating @xmath3 of a quiescent disc is key to gauge which model is at work in a given dwarf nova .",
    "aside of the normal outbursts , the short - period dwarf novae of the suuma type show longer , slightly brighter and more regular superoutbursts , during which a hump - shaped brightness modulation ( named _ superhump _ ) with period slightly longer than the orbital period @xmath8 is seen in their light curves @xcite .",
    "the most promising explanation for superhumps is given by the tidal resonance instability model @xcite : during a superoutburst , the accretion disc expands beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , @xmath9 , and a tidal instability sets in , giving rise to an elliptical , slowly precessing disc .",
    "superhump modulation then arises from the periodic tidal interaction between the outer elliptical disc and the mass - donor star ( normal superhumps ) or by the varying release of gravitational energy at the point where the gas stream hits the precessing elliptical disc outer edge ( late superhumps ) , at the beat period between the orbital and the disc precession period , @xmath10 .",
    "eclipse mapping @xcite is a powerful tool to test for the presence of elliptical discs in outbursting dwarf novae as well as to check whether the orientation of the ellipse is according to the expectation of the tidal instability model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "flickering is the intrinsic brightness fluctuation of 0.01 - 1 mag on timescales of seconds to dozens of minutes seen in dwarf novae light curves .",
    "optical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest there may be three different sources of flickering in dwarf novae and novalike systems , the relative importance of which varies from system to system : ( i ) the stream - disc impact region ( possibly because of unsteady mass transfer or post - shock turbulence , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( ii ) the innermost disc regions around the wd [ ] ej82,bruch92 , and ( iii ) the accretion disc itself ( probably as a consequence of magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence or events of magnetic reconnection at the disc atmosphere , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the power density spectrum ( pds ) of the flickering is characterized by a continuum power - law , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 @xcite , which flattens below a given cut - off frequency @xmath13 .",
    "currently , the most promising explanation for the anomalously large viscosity of accretion discs is related to mhd turbulence in the differentially rotating disc gas ( driven by the magnetorotational instability , mri , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of the studies on this subject over the last two decades focused on confirming that mri leads to self - sustained , turbulent and efficient outward flow of angular momentum and inward flow of disc matter ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and on the comparison of the numerically derived values of @xmath3 with those inferred by the decline timescale of outbursting dwarf novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the study of @xcite focused on the time variability of the viscous energy release in a mhd turbulent disc .",
    "they found that mhd turbulence leads to large fluctuations in the energy dissipation rate per unit area at the disc surface , @xmath14 , which they suggested could be a source of flickering in mass - exchanging binaries .",
    "indeed , the pds of the fluctuations in their study resemble those of flickering sources , with a power - law dependency of similar index range and a flat slope at low - frequencies .",
    "the interpretation of the fluctuations in @xmath14 as the stochastic and statistically independent release of energy from a large number of turbulent eddies leads to a direct relation between the relative amplitude of the energy fluctuations @xmath15 and the disc viscosity parameter , @xmath16 , providing an interesting observational way to estimate the local accretion disc viscosity parameter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . for a thin accretion disc ( @xmath17 ) ,",
    "the above relation predicts that low - viscosity discs ( @xmath18 ) should show low - amplitude disc flickering ( hardly detectable at a level @xmath19 per cent ) , whereas high - viscosity discs ( @xmath20 0.1 - 1 ) should display detectable flickering with relative amplitudes in the range 2.5 - 7.5 per cent .",
    "there is observational support for this prediction : e.g. , the accretion disc seems the dominant source of flickering in the high - viscosity discs of the novalike systems rwtri @xcite and uxuma @xcite , whereas there is no evidence of disc - related flickering in the low - viscosity accretion discs of the dwarf novae ugem @xcite and ippeg @xcite in quiescence .",

    "the object was back to its quiescent state from sep 27 onwards . given the typical shape and length of the v4140  sgr outbursts @xcite , the sep 12 data probably correspond to the outburst plateau phase ( i.e. , past outburst maximum ) . as previously noted by @xcite ,",
    "the eclipses in outburst are shallower than in quiescence , indicating that the brightness increase is mainly from the outer and partially eclipsed disc regions .",
    "the presence of superhumps in the outburst light curves ( sect.[super ] ) indicates that this was a superoutburst .",

    "all light curves were then offset by @xmath57 cycle to make the wd eclipse centre coincident with phase zero .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] shows phase - folded light curves of v4140 sgr grouped per brightness state .",
    "the median quiescent light curve displays a steep , narrow eclipse with a long egress shoulder and a weak orbital hump with an apparent maximum at phase @xmath58 cycle , signaling a small contribution from the bright spot at disc rim to the total flux .",
    "the superoutburst light curves show strong flickering ( at @xmath59 per cent level ) and a pronounced , broad superhump centred at phase zero . in the decline",
    "light curves , flickering amplitude is reduced ( in absolute and relative terms ) and the superhump maximum is displaced to phase @xmath60 cycle .",
    "flares and flickers occurring right before ingress and just after egress of the wd suggest that a significant fraction of the flickering in superoutburst and decline arises from the inner disc regions .",
    "unfortunately , the small number of light curves covering superoutburst and decline prevents us from applying flickering mapping techniques ( see sect.[quies ] ) to derive the spatial distribution of the flickering sources at these brightness states .",
    "the total width of the eclipses decreases with decreasing brightness level suggesting that the accretion disc shrinks along the decline from superoutburst , being smallest in quiescence .",
    "furthermore , the depth of the eclipses increases with decreasing brightness signaling that the relative contribution of the outer disc regions to the total flux decreases along the decline and is also smallest in quiescence .",
    "was the 2006 sep outburst a normal one or a superoutburst ?",
    "a straightforward way to address this questions is by searching for superhumps in the outburst and decline light curves . in order to detect non - orbital periodicities",
    ", we removed the eclipses ( phase range @xmath61 to @xmath62 ) from the light curves and computed lomb - scargle periodgrams @xcite separately for the sep 12 and sep 24 data .",
    "the power spectrum of the latter data set shows a periodicity at frequency @xmath63 , corresponding to a period of @xmath64  d , where the quoted uncertainty is derived from the width at half power of the observed peak .",
    "the same periodicity is found in the sep 12 periodgram , although the corresponding power spectrum peak is less pronounced in this case .",
    "this period is consistently longer than the orbital period , and is the same in both nights within the uncertainties .",
    "moreover , the maximum of the observed modulation coincides with phase zero on sep 12 and has shifted to phase @xmath60 cycle on sep 24 ( fig.[fig2 ] ) , indicating that it is not the consequence of anisotropic emission from a bright spot at disc rim , and confirming that @xmath65 is different from the orbital period .",
    "also , the length of the 2006 sep outburst is at least 13 days ( it probably started before sep 12 ) , which is clearly longer than the typical 5 - 10d duration of the normal outbursts of this dwarf nova @xcite . these evidences give us confidence that the observed modulations in sep 12 and sep 24 light curves are indeed superhumps and , therefore , that these observations framed a superoutburst of v4140  sgr .",
    "as a consequence of the short time span of the observations ( only 2 - 3 binary orbits in each date ) , the uncertainty in @xmath65 is too large to allow a meaningful derivation of a superhump period excess from @xmath65 .",
    "we attempted to increase the accuracy of the measurement of @xmath65 by computing a power spectrum of the combined light curve of both nights .",
    "however , no periodicity other than harmonics of the orbital period appears in this case , suggesting a significant change in phase of the superhump signal along this time interval  as is usual in superoutbursting dwarf novae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we grouped the data per outburst stage to generate phase - binned , median - averaged light curves for the outburst ( sep 12 data ) , decline ( sep 24 data ) and quiescence ( the remaining data sets ) brightness states .",
    "the resulting light curves have phase resolutions of 0.003  cycle during eclipse ( phase range @xmath61 to @xmath62 cycle ) and of 0.009  cycle outside of eclipse . only orbital phases in the range @xmath66 to @xmath67  cycle",
    "are included because our eclipse mapping algorithm does not handle a possible eclipse of the secondary star by the accretion disc ( at phase @xmath68 ) .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) maximum entropy eclipse mapping techniques were applied to these light curves in order to investigate the source of the superhump and to follow the evolution of the disc surface brightness distribution along the superoutburst decline .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the historical presentation , @xcite for a description and performance tests of the 3d eclipse mapping algorithm , and @xcite for a more recent review on eclipse mapping techniques .",
    "our 3d eclipse map consists of a grid of @xmath69 pixels on a conical surface with side @xmath70 ( where @xmath71 is the distance from disc centre to the inner lagrangian point ) centred at the wd position and inclined at a half - opening angle @xmath72 with respect to the orbital plane , plus a circular rim of 102 pixels orthogonal to the orbital plane at a distance @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) from the disc centre .",
    "the disc rim allows us to model out - of - eclipse modulations ( such as anisotropic emission from the bright spot at stream - disc impact ) as the fore - shortening of an azimuthally - dependent brightness distribution in the disc rim pixels @xcite .",
    "the eclipse geometry is defined by the mass ratio @xmath75 and the inclination @xmath76 , and the scale of the map is set by @xmath71 .",
    "we adopted @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xcite , which correspond to a wd eclipse width of @xmath80  cycle @xcite .",
    "this combination of parameters ensures that the wd is at the centre of the map .",
    "the light curves were analyzed by the 3d eclipse mapping algorithm to solve for a map of the disc + rim surface brightness distribution .",
    "the reconstructions were performed with a polar gaussian default function @xcite with radial blur width @xmath81 and azimuthal blur width @xmath82 , and reached a final reduced chi - square @xmath83 for all light curves .",
    "the uncertainties in the eclipse maps were derived from monte carlo simulations with the light curves using the bootstrap technique @xcite , generating a set of 20 randomized eclipse maps ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these are combined to produce a map of the standard deviations with respect to the true map . a map of the statistical significance ( or the inverse of the relative error )",
    "is obtained by dividing the true eclipse map by the map of the standard deviations @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties obtained with this procedure are used to draw the contour maps of fig.[fig4 ] , and to estimate the uncertainties in the derived disc rim intensity ( fig.[fig4 ] ) and radial brightness temperature distributions ( fig.[fig5 ] ) .",
    "an entropy landscape technique was used to derive the best - fit disc rim radius @xmath73 and half - opening angle @xmath72 for each brightness state ( see appendix ) .",
    "we obtained reconstructions for disc rims in the range @xmath84 at steps of @xmath85 , and half - opening angles in the range @xmath86 at steps of @xmath87 , and investigated the resulting space of parameters in search of the combination @xmath88 that yields the eclipse map of highest entropy .",
    "the space of parameters is well behaved with a single , well defined entropy maximum in each case .",
    "@xmath73 is best constrained in outburst , while @xmath72 is better constrained in quiescence : the entropy of the eclipse maps drops quickly for @xmath89 in outburst , and for @xmath90 in quiescence .",

    "these results are in line with the qualitative inferences drawn in sect.[lcurve ] and in agreement with the @xmath94 quiescent disc radius found by @xcite .",
    "there is marginal evidence that the disc half - opening angle is larger in outburst ( @xmath95 ) than in quiescence ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the disc is geometrically thin in all three cases .    in order to check the consistency of the inferred @xmath73 values",
    ", we applied the method described by @xcite to estimate the disc radius from the half - width of the eclipse @xmath97 . by assuming a spherical secondary star it is possible to derive the disc radius @xmath73 in units of the orbital separation @xmath98 from the analytical expression , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the radius of a sphere containing the same volume as the roche lobe of the secondary star , given by the relation @xcite , @xmath101 values of @xmath102",
    "are transformed to @xmath103 assuming @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath97 were obtained by fitting a spline function to the out - of - eclipse phases of each light curve , finding the phases where the fitted spline deviates from the data by 1@xmath105 of the local , out - of - eclipse median flux , and dividing the resulting phase range by two .",
    "we find @xmath97 values of @xmath106  cycle , @xmath107  cycle and @xmath108  cycle , respectively for the outburst , decline and quiescence light curves .",
    "these measurements lead to corresponding disc radii of @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , in very good agreement with the values derived from the entropy landscape procedure .",
    "the measured ingress / egress eclipse phases are depicted as pairs of vertical tick marks in the left - hand panels of fig.[fig4 ] .    we used the expression of @xcite to compute a circularization radius ( the smallest possible radius for an inviscid accretion disc ) of @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the measured quiescent disc radius of v4140 sgr is larger than its circularization radius at a @xmath113 confidence level .",
    "eclipse maps corresponding to the best - fit ( @xmath114 ) values are shown in fig.[fig4 ] , together with the data and model light curves .",
    "the orientation of the eclipse maps is such that the secondary star rotates counter - clockwise around the wd at the centre of the map ( in the observer s reference frame ) , while the observer rotates clockwise ( in the binary reference frame ) . at phase zero , the secondary and the observer are on the right side of the map ( with the projected shadow of the secondary star covering most of the disc ) . at phase @xmath115  cycle",
    "the observer is at the bottom ( in the binary frame ) while the secondary star is at the top of the eclipse map ( in the observer s frame ) .",
    "the inner disc regions remain roughly at the same brightness level through outburst , while significant brightness changes take place in the outer disc regions . in order to emphasize these changes and the brightness asymmetries in the outer disc regions ,",
    "the inner disc regions of the eclipse maps ( @xmath116 ) were masked in the middle - right panels of fig.[fig4 ] .    at outburst ,",
    "the surface brightness distribution of the outer disc is skewed towards the l1 point indicating that the disc is elliptical at this stage .",
    "two dotted circles are overplotted on the eclipse map to help visualize the elliptical disc brightness distribution .",
    "the outer circle corresponds to the disc rim @xmath117 , while the inner circle has @xmath118 . from these radii",
    "we estimate a disc eccentricity @xmath119 . for our outburst",
    "dataset the phase of superhump maximum coincides with mid - eclipse , right when the bulge of the elliptical disc is aligned with the secondary star . although less conspicuous , a similar brightness asymmetry is also present in the decline eclipse map . in this case",
    "the major axis of the ellipse is oriented at an angle @xmath120 with respect to the line joining both stars , implying that the alignment of the secondary star with its bulge occurs at binary phase @xmath121  cycle .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observed phase of superhump maximum in the decline light curve , @xmath122  cycle . from this eclipse map",
    "we find @xmath123 and @xmath124 , also leading to a disc eccentricity @xmath0 .",
    "these results are in line with the tidal resonance instability model , which explains superhumps in terms of enhanced tidal dissipation ( and extra disc emission ) as the secondary star passes closer to the bulge of a slowly precessing elliptical disc @xcite . for v4140  sgr ,",
    "the 3:1 resonance radius is @xmath125 . at outburst ,",
    "the disc is comfortably larger than @xmath9 ( @xmath126 ) , whereas in the decline dataset the disc radius is slightly smaller than @xmath9 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the measured disc eccentricities are in good agreement with the @xmath128 value found in numerical simulations of the tidal resonance instability by @xcite .",
    "since the timescale of disc precession ( @xmath129 2 - 3 days , see table3.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is much longer than @xmath8 , the change in orientation of the elliptical disc along the time span of the outburst and decline datasets ( @xmath130  h ) is @xmath131 , smaller than the azimuthal smearing effect adopted for the maximum entropy reconstructions ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "therefore , there is no significant azimuthal ` blurring ' of the outburst and decline eclipse maps caused by the slow precession of the elliptical disc .",
    "the right - hand panels of fig.[fig4 ] show the brightness distributions along the disc rim .",
    "a word of caution is on demand before we attempt to interpret these distributions .",
    "one of the basic assumptions of the eclipse mapping method is that the intensities in the eclipse map are independent of binary phase , and that all changes in the light curve are caused by variable visibility and/or aspect of pixels with phase .",
    "superhumps clearly violate this assumption if they correspond to true , physical changes in intensity of accretion disc regions with binary phase .",
    "therefore , the disc rim intensity distributions in outburst and decline should not be interpreted as if there is enhanced emission from extended regions at disc rim .",
    "instead , they just signal the azimuths ( or binary phases ) where enhanced emission from the superhump light source occurs in each light curve .",
    "thus , the disc rim distributions tell us that superhump emission is produced over a large fraction of the orbital period and is centreed at phase @xmath132 in outburst and decline , respectively ( of course , this can also be inferred by direct inspection of the corresponding light curves ) .",
    "however , an additional useful information is that , aside of the elliptical disc bulge ( responsible for the disc rim emission at azimuth @xmath133 ) , there are two other superhump light sources in outburst , at azimuths @xmath134  when the secondary star is roughly orthogonal to the major axis of the elliptical disc . a similar inference can be drawn from the decline disc rim distribution , although in this case the two sources are closer in azimuth than in outburst and the disc bulge contribution seems considerably reduced or blended in azimuth with that from the two side sources .",
    "these results are reminiscent to those of @xcite .",
    "he applied a modified eclipse mapping technique to investigate the superhump light source in z  cha when superhump maximum is centreed in eclipse , and found that the extra emission arises from three sources in the outer disc regions , one towards the l1 point and two sources symmetrically located in the orthogonal directions .",

    "the discrepancy between the inferred @xmath3 values and dim predictions is statistically significant at the @xmath227 confidence level outside the region @xmath226 .    the high - viscosity , steady - state quiescent disc of v4140  sgr and the inferred low disc temperatures in superoutburst are inconsistent with expectations of the disc - instability model , and lead to the conclusion that the outbursts of v4140  sgr are powered by the only other mechanism considered so far , namely , bursts of enhanced mass transfer rate from its donor star .",
    "the dominant source of uncertainty in the computed @xmath222 distribution are the errors in the relative amplitude of the high - frequency , disc - related flickering component .",
    "these errors can be reduced by increasing the @xmath232 of the flickering curves , i.e. , by increasing the statistics and/or the @xmath232 of the individual light curves included in the data sample .",
    "the benefits of this observational effort are double : it will allow a more meaningful and statistically robust estimate of the magnitude of the disc viscosity parameter and it will open the possibility to properly probe changes in @xmath3 with radius .",

    "here we report simulations aimed to show the performance of our 3d eclipse mapping code in reproducing accretion disc brightness distributions with out - of - eclipse modulations .",
    "we also show how the entropy of the eclipse map can be used to constrain the disc half - opening angle @xmath72 and the disc rim radius @xmath73 .",
    "we illustrate the performance of the 3d eclipse mapping code with reconstructions from a synthetic eclipse map comprised of a steady - state ( @xmath157 ) , axi - symmetric disc brightness distribution plus a bright spot `` painted '' in the disc rim at an azimuth of @xmath233 ( azimuths are counted counter - clockwise from the line joining both stars ) .",
    "this model distribution is shown in fig.[figsim3](a ) .    .",

    "( d ) the same as in ( c ) for an overestimated @xmath236 . ( e ) a reconstruction with correct @xmath72 but underestimated @xmath237 .",

    "it was convolved with the eclipse geometry of v4140  sgr ( @xmath239 ) and pairs of values ( @xmath240 ) to generate synthetic light curves to which gaussian noise was added in order to simulate real data .",
    "each of these light curves were then subjected to the 3d eclipse mapping code .",
    "if an eclipse mapping reconstruction is performed with the wrong choice of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the code will develop artifacts in the brightness distribution in order to compensate for the incorrect parameters .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[figsim3 ] . a synthetic light curve with added gaussian noise ( @xmath49 )",
    "was generated from the brightness distribution of fig.[figsim3](a ) and reconstructions were obtained for different combinations of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "fig.[figsim3](b ) shows a reconstruction with the correct geometry @xmath241 .",
    "the disc surface brightness distribution and the azimuth of the spot at disc rim are well recovered .",
    "the azimuthal blur of the spot at disc rim is intrinsic to the eclipse mapping method and is controlled by the choice of @xmath242 ( see sect.[erup ] ) .",
    "figs.[figsim3](c ) and ( d ) show the effects of errors in the choice of @xmath72 . underestimating ( overestimating ) the disc half - opening angle forces the code to artificially increase the brightness of the disc hemisphere farther away from ( closest to ) the l1 point to compensate for their lower effective area during eclipse . eclipse maps with these spurious , additional structures have lower entropy than the map with the correct choice of @xmath72 and @xmath73 . measures the amount of structure in an eclipse map .",
    "the more structured an eclipse map is , the lower its entropy is .",
    "the map of highest entropy @xmath243 is the one with the least amount of structures allowed by the data . ]",
    "figs.[figsim3](e ) and ( f ) show the effects of errors in the choice of @xmath73 .",
    "again , artifacts develop in the disc brightness distribution in order to compensate for the wrong radial position of the disc rim . in both cases ,",
    "the additional asymmetry leads to eclipse maps of lower entropy . because of these artifacts , reconstructions obtained with a wrong choice of ( @xmath244 ) have lower entropy than that with the correct combination of parameters .",
    "therefore , it is possible to use the entropy of the eclipse map as a tool to gauge the correct choice of ( @xmath240 ) . in order to do this ,",
    "we obtain reconstructions covering the space of parameters ( @xmath240 ) with a suitable sampling and we search for the combination which leads to the reconstruction of highest entropy ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "this is called ` entropy landscape ' , a technique that has been successfully used to find best - fit parameters with other image reconstruction methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "fig.[figsim2 ] illustrates the procedure .",
    "we generated an input synthetic light curve ( @xmath49 ) from the brightness distribution of fig.[figsim3](a ) for a given combination of parameters ( @xmath246 ) and obtained reconstructions of that light curve for a range of ( @xmath244 ) values .",
    "the space of parameters is covered by sampling @xmath72 in the range @xmath86 at steps of @xmath87 , and by sampling @xmath73 in the range @xmath84 at steps of @xmath247 .",
    "the left - hand panels show the entropy of the reconstruction as a function of @xmath72 for light curves obtained with three different @xmath248 values and fixed @xmath249 , whereas the right - hand panels show the entropy of the reconstruction as a function of @xmath73 for light curves obtained with three different @xmath250 values and fixed @xmath251 .",
    "it is possible to recover the correct value of @xmath72 with an accuracy of @xmath252 , and the correct value of @xmath73 with an accuracy of @xmath253 .",
    "these results are confirmed with a series of simulations with several different brightness distributions and light curves with @xmath232 comparable to those of the v4140  sgr data ."
