    "multiple antenna communication systems have been actively studied recently  @xcite . by exploiting the temporal and spatial diversity at both transmitter side and receiver side , such kind of systems can increase the channel capacity compared to single antenna communication systems , consequently promising more reliable data transmission for high rate applications .",
    "we investigate a communication system under rayleigh flat fading assumptions and we further assume fading is quasi - static over a time period of length @xmath0 .",
    "denote by @xmath1 or @xmath2 the number of transmitting or receiving antennas , respectively .",
    "let @xmath3 represent the expected signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at each receiving antenna .",
    "for the system above , the basic equation between the received signal @xmath4 , which is a @xmath5 matrix , and the transmitted signal @xmath6 , which is chosen from a @xmath7 matrix constellation @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the constellation size ) , is given through : @xmath10 where the @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 accounts for the multiplicative complex gaussian fading coefficients and the @xmath13 matrix @xmath14 accounts for the additive white gaussian noise .",
    "the entries @xmath15 of the matrix @xmath12 as well as the entries @xmath16 of the matrix @xmath14 are assumed to have a statistically independent complex normal distribution @xmath17 .",
    "one can verify that the transmission rate is determined by @xmath9 and @xmath0 : @xmath18    when the fading coefficients are unknown to the transmitter however known to the receiver , it is proven  @xcite that the channel capacity will increase linearly with @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath12 is known to the receiver , for a received signal @xmath4 the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoder will take the following evaluation to resolve the most likely sent signal ( codeword ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents frobenius norm .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the probability that ml decoder is mistaking @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "the upper bound of this error probability has been derived in  @xcite : @xmath25^{-n}.\\ ] ]    through the analysis of the above upper bound , design criteria for designing codes for the coherent channel with ideal channel state information ( csi ) are proposed in  @xcite :    _ the rank criterion _ : in order to achieve the maximum diversity @xmath26 , the matrix @xmath27 has to have full rank for any codewords @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath28 has minimum rank @xmath29 over the set of two tuples of distinct codewords , then a diversity @xmath30 is achieved .    _ the determinant criterion _",
    ": suppose that a diversity benefit of @xmath30 is our target .",
    "the minimum of @xmath29th roots of the sum of determinants of all @xmath31 principal cofactors of @xmath32 taken over all pairs of distinct codewords @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponds to the coding advantage , where @xmath29 is the rank of @xmath33 .    note that for the case when @xmath34 and full diversity is achieved , the above design criteria can be simplified as follows :    construct a constellation of matrix @xmath35 such that the diversity product  @xcite @xmath36 is as large as possible .",
    "orthogonal designs have been investigated for the constellation construction for coherent channels . using a complex orthogonal design ,",
    "alamouti  @xcite proposed a very simple transmitter diversity scheme with @xmath37 transmitting antennas .",
    "a very interesting coding scheme from the real orthogonal designs is presented in  @xcite . applying the similar idea as in  @xcite",
    ", the authors also explain how the symmetric structure of the orthogonal design codes leads to a much simpler decoding algorithm .",
    "however no explicit constellations have been studied in details in these work .    for a slow fading channel , for instance a fixed wireless communication system ,",
    "the coherent assumption is reasonable because the transmitter can send pilot signals which allow the receiver to estimate the fading coefficients accurately .",
    "however in certain situations , due to the difficulty of measuring the fading coefficients under the practical communication environment ( for instance the limited resources or a fast fading link ) the above coherent model would be questionable .",
    "because of this , researchers put their efforts into the case when the channel is non - coherent , i.e. , the csi is not known by either the transmitter or the receiver .    in  @xcite , hochwald and marzetta study unitary space - time modulation for a non - coherent channel .",
    "we will use the same notations as in the coherent case , so the basic equation will be still the same : @xmath10 however in non - coherent scenarios it is assumed that the receiver does not know the exact values of the entries of @xmath12 ( other than their statistical distribution ) .",
    "another difference is that the signal constellation @xmath38 has unitary constraints : @xmath39 for @xmath40 .",
    "the last equation simply states that the columns of @xmath41 form a `` unitary frame '' , i.e. , the column vectors all have unit length in the complex vector space @xmath42 and the vectors are pairwise orthogonal .",
    "the scaled matrices @xmath43 , represent the codewords used during the transmission .",
    "the decoding task asks for the computation of the most likely sent codeword @xmath44 given the received signal @xmath4 . under the assumption of above model",
    "the ml decoder will have to compute : @xmath45 for each received signal @xmath4 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it has been shown in  @xcite that the pairwise probability of mistaking @xmath23 for @xmath24 using ml decoding satisfies : @xmath46^{-n},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the @xmath48-th singular value of @xmath49 .",
    "an important special case occurs when @xmath50 .",
    "in this situation it is customary to represent the unitary matrix @xmath41 in the form : @xmath51 note that by the definition of @xmath41 the matrix @xmath52 is a @xmath53 unitary matrix . in most of the literature mentioned above researchers",
    "focus their attention on constellations having the special form  .",
    "a differential modulation scheme is discussed in  @xcite and this special form is used . in this scheme , one does not send the identity matrix ( the upper part of the signal ) every time .",
    "instead of sending @xmath54 one sends @xmath55 this increases the transmission rate by a factor of 2 to : @xmath56 let @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the sent and received signals at time @xmath59 respectively , the ml decoder of the above differential space time modulation scheme will have to compute : @xmath60 for the constellations with the special form  , the pairwise error probability satisfies : @xmath61^{-n}.\\ ] ] as explained in  @xcite , at high snr scenarios the right side of the above inequality is governed by the diversity product : @xmath62 so the unitary differential modulation design criterion for a non - coherent channel is to choose a constellation @xmath63 such that @xmath64 is as large as possible .",
    "we call a constellation @xmath63 fully diverse if @xmath65 .",
    "interestingly enough the normalized complex orthogonal design alamouti codes and real orthogonal design codes can be used in non - coherent scenarios too .",
    "our work will be mainly about non - coherent channels , however without any doubts the resulting codes can be used for coherent channels too . in this paper",
    "we will show how to construct space time codes from these schemes using generalized phase shift keying ( gpsk ) signals .",
    "our results can be applied to generalized orthogonal design in  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ section-2 ] , three series of @xmath37 dimensional gpsk constellations from complex orthogonal designs will be presented .",
    "an algebraic calculation will show that they have larger diversity products than the original orthogonal design constellations . as a consequence of larger diversity ,",
    "the ml decoding of a gpsk constellation gives better performance . in section 3 ,",
    "we explicitly construct gpsk constellations from the real orthogonal designs .",
    "fast decoding algorithms for the proposed constellations will be presented in section 2 and section 3 . finally in section 4",
    "we will give the conclusions and some future work .",
    "[ section-2 ]    a very simple yet interesting complex orthogonal scheme is described in  @xcite .",
    "we will consider the normalized version of this proposed code , i.e. , every element of this code is a matrix given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "observe that @xmath68 is a unitary matrix and a constellation @xmath69 with size @xmath70 is obtained by letting @xmath71 and @xmath72 range over the set of @xmath73-th roots of unity @xmath74 namely the entries of the matrix are chosen from scaled one dimensional psk signal set @xmath75 .",
    "this would be the most commonly implemented alamouti s scheme .",
    "the diversity product of the constellation @xmath69 is @xmath76 note that @xmath69 is similar to @xmath75 in the sense that all the elements in @xmath69 have unit energy and every pair of elements differ only by the phases .",
    "@xmath69 is a subset of the special unitary group @xmath77 in this section we will present three series of unitary constellations as finite subsets of @xmath78 .",
    "the basic principle to decode the constellation @xmath69 has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we are going to describe this decoding process in another way with more details and generalize it to our constellations .",
    "consider a non - coherent wireless communication system modulated by @xmath69 with @xmath37 transmitting antennas and @xmath2 receiving antennas and assume the differential unitary space time modulation  @xcite is used .",
    "let @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the received matrices at time block @xmath59 and @xmath81 , respectively , then the ml decoder will perform the following decoding task @xmath82 with simple matrix manipulations , one can check that @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 further algebraic simplifications show that ml decoding is very simple : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent of each other ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be chosen freely in the set @xmath75 ) , the evaluations above amount to @xmath91 and @xmath92 rewrite @xmath71 as @xmath93 and @xmath72 as @xmath94 and let @xmath95 i.e. , @xmath96 denotes the smaller of the closest integers to @xmath29 .",
    "the ml decoder will take the following simple form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "assume that a communication channel is modulated by one dimensional psk signals @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath100 denote the sent signal at one time and @xmath101 denote the corresponding corrupted signal .",
    "the ml decoding will look for the closest signal @xmath102 to @xmath71 in the signal set @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath103 compare formula   and formula  , one can conclude that the decoding of space time code @xmath69 is decomposable and can be implemented by taking one dimensional psk demodulation twice .",
    "the normalized alamouti codes @xmath69 s admit very simple decoding algorithms , since roughly only @xmath104 complex multiplications and @xmath104 complex additions are needed .",
    "we are going to introduce other complex orthogonal codes using generalized psk ( gpsk ) signals in the sequel .",
    "instead of allocating the same energy to every transmitting antenna , we attempt to exploit the transmit diversity and optimize the power allocation . compared to @xmath69 , these codes have larger diversity , which promise good performances with ml decoding . due to the symmetry from gpsk signals ,",
    "these codes are also decomposable , therefore fast decoding algorithms can be also applied to these codes . in the following three subsections we present the constructions of these three series of constellations .",
    "let @xmath73 be an even number and let @xmath105 be the root of the following equation @xmath106 consider the following sets of the scaled one dimensional psk signals : @xmath107 @xmath108 @xmath109 consider the following subsets of @xmath78 : @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112    let @xmath113 @xmath114 is a fully diverse constellation of @xmath115 elements with diversity product : @xmath116    take two elements @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
