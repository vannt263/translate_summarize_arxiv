    "a brief summary is as follows .",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be described using green s function techniques  @xcite , but these involve solving complex integral equations over infinite domains . under some circumstances",
    "one can approximate the kernels of these equations either as the incident wave or as a semi - classical perturbed wave , leading to the well - known rayleigh - gans ( r - g ) and anomalous diffraction approximations ( ada ) .",
    "these have been used by umer and coworkers to examine the problems we consider in this paper  @xcite . however , the approximations are only valid over certain wavelength and optical contrast regimes . the century - old mie strategy and its modern _",
    "t_matrix extensions yield exact solutions , but unfortunately this approach does not work in every case . finally one can of course use real space finite element approaches , but these are notoriously inefficient at reproducing known solutions . for a more comprehensive review",
    "we refer the reader to chap .  2 in  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the _ t_-matrix theory _ is _ known to be a computationally efficient approach to study light scattering by nonspherical optically isotropic particles  @xcite .",
    "one may thus expect that a _ t_matrix approach to geometrically spherical but optically non - spherical scatterers can at the very least enable scattering properties to be evaluated when the approximate methods can not be applied .",
    "in addition , whereas the region of validity of the approximate methods such as r - g and ada in the case of isotropic scatterers is reasonably well - understood , in the case of anisotropic scatterers this problem has not been been studied in any detail .    in i",
    "we have discussed composite spherical scatterers , consisting of a central isotropic core plus a surrounding annular layer in which the optical tensor is anisotropic : @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the anisotropy parameter . for radial anisotropy the optical axis , @xmath2 , is directed along the radius vector , @xmath3 , and for the uniform anisotropy the optical axis is parallel to the @xmath4-axis , @xmath5 .",
    "these cases present different mathematical challenges to the theorist .",
    "light scattering from the radially anisotropic annular layer was first studied long ago by roth and digman  @xcite using the technique normally known as debye potentials . in an earlier paper",
    "@xcite we have recovered this solution as a special case of a more general set of anisotropies . a crucial step in",
    "the derivation of this result involves writing the so - called modified _",
    "t_-matrix ansatz ( see eqs .",
    "( 26.i)-(27.i ) ) . the spherical symmetry of the scatterer requires the modes  ( 27.i ) entering the ansatz  ( 26.i ) to be proportional to the corresponding vector spherical harmonics .",
    "as a result the scattering does not mix different angular momenta .",
    "t_matrix is then diagonal over the angular momentum indices and the azimuthal numbers and the elements of the _ t_-matrix are expressible in closed form ( see sec .",
    "iv.a of  i ) .",
    "the uniform anisotropy case is much more difficult .",
    "the light scattering problem for a uniformly anisotropic spherical scatterer is not exactly solvable  @xcite . as an alternative",
    ", it has been studied by using r - g and ada  @xcite .",
    "in i we approached this problem by formulating it as a suitably modified _",
    "t_-matrix theory .",
    "it is necessary to relate the plane wave packet representation to expansions of electromagnetic fields over vector spherical harmonics .",
    "the net result is to define a set of wave functions representing _ exact solutions _ of maxwell s equations in an anisotropic layer that are at the same time deformed spherical harmonics .",
    "the coefficient functions that enter the expressions for these wave functions describe angular momentum mixing and are computationally accessible .",
    "in this paper we find numerical results for the total scattering cross - section in the limiting case of a droplet , i.e. when the radius of the isotropic core of the scatterer , @xmath6 , is negligible ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the scattering by a droplet presents fewer technical difficulties than scattering by the annular layer which was our principal focus in i. anisotropy effects are our primary concern and for this reason we pay special attention to the case where the scattering can be solely attributed to the presence of the anisotropy .",
    "specifically , in our subsequent calculations we consider the special case for which the ordinary wave refractive index and the refractive index of the material are matched , @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",

    "we put the magnetic permittivity equal to the unit and slightly change the notations : @xmath17 and @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to the physical condition in which there is a matching condition for the refracted ordinary wave inside the scattering droplet .",

    "these are the equivalent of the equations ( 51.i ) for scattering by a spherical annulus .",
    "the equations are considerably simpler , as a result of what might be called mode decoupling .",
    "the crucial point is that the normal modes inside the droplet are all regular at the origin , and thus two types of modes which appear in the case of the annulus do not appear here .",

    "the uniformly anisotropic droplets seem to be more sensitive to changes both in the size and in the anisotropy parameters .",
    "in this work we have described some of the numerical results calculated using the _ t_-matrix theory developed in paper  i. in particular , we have studied the scattering efficiency of radially and uniformly anisotropic droplets in which the ordinary refractive index matches the refractive index of the material surrounding them .    the assumption",
    "in which the ordinary refractive index of the droplet matches the isotropic dielectric constant in the surrounding medium is not taken in order to simplify the numerical treatment . rather in this paper",
    "we wish to study the light scattering properties which can be solely attributed to the _ anisotropic _ part of the dielectric tensor .",
    "thus we have the anisotropy effects separated out to concentrate on differences between isotropic and anisotropic optical axis distributions .",
    "clearly , the difference in symmetry causes the most crucial differences in the light scattering . for uniformly anisotropic droplets the scattering efficiency depends on the angle of incidence and the polarisation of incoming wave , whereas for radially anisotropic scatterers it does not . in other words , the scattering from radially anisotropic droplet shares some features of isotropic scatterers .      the graphs plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : eff_vs_kr]-[fig : eff_u_rad ] indicate that uniformly anisotropic droplets are more sensitive to changes in the wavelength and anisotropy parameters than are radially anisotropic droplets .",
    "our results are also consistent with results of previous studies  @xcite that the internal spatial distribution of the optical axis is a factor which strongly affects light scattering from anisotropic scatterers .",
    "the results of this work can be regarded as the first step towards more comprehensive study of light scattering by anisotropic scatterers .",
    "we have demonstrated that the _",
    "t_-matrix approach developed in  i can be used in an efficient numerical treatment of the scattering problem .",
