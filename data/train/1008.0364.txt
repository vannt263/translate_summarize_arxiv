    "the higgs sector of the standard model might have a landau - ginzburg effective description , in which the higgs doublet is a condensate of fermion and antifermion .",
    "the constituent fermions could be the top quark in the top - quark condensation models , or technifermions in the technicolor models ( see refs .   for reviews ) .",
    "a new interaction , e.g. , a four - fermion interaction or technicolor , is introduced at the composite scale .",
    "recently it has been shown@xcite that in the standard model with four generations ( sm4 ) , the renormalization group evolutions of the yukawa and quartic couplings can reach a quasi - fixed point at the tev scale ( @xmath0 ) , where the yukawa couplings become strong enough for the 4th generation to form condensates .",
    "this can be seen by considering a nonrelativistic higgs - exchange potential between a fermion and an antifermion @xmath1 by numerical analysis , the bound state condition is found to be @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is expressed in terms of the yukawa couplings and the quartic couplings as @xmath4 .",
    "the values @xmath5 for the 4th generation and for the top quark are plotted against the energy scale in fig .",
    "[ condensates ] .    to study the strong dynamics of yukawa couplings in a relativistic way , the schwinger - dyson equation is used to find the critical coupling for the yukawa interactions@xcite , following the strong qed case considered by leung , love , and bardeen@xcite .",
    "it also leads to the condensates of the 4th generation at the tev scale , consistent with the renormalization group and the nonrelativistic analyses .",
    "if the 4th generation really exists , the masses of the 4th generation quarks should be greater than 400 gev , in order to have @xmath0 located at the tev scale .",
    "we will need such a cutoff scale in the next section .",
    "the condensate @xmath6 can be considered as a composite scalar and one may ask : what about a composite vector ?",
    "the possibility of the bilinear form @xmath7 developing a nonvanishing vev has been considered by bjorken@xcite and others@xcite .",
    "some realistic models are also built in the quark systems with finite density , for example , langfeld , reinhardt , and rho ( lrr ) found that@xcite in the dense hadronic medium , there exists a critical chemical potential @xmath8 , above which the system can have spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking ( on top of an explicit breaking ) .",
    "this new phase is used to explain the enhanced dilepton production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . in this section",
    "we apply the lrr mechanism to the physics at the tev scale , combine these models in the sm4 scenario , and focus on the 4th generation quark ( @xmath9 ) , although @xmath9 might be other heavy fermions beyond the standard model , such as technifermions in technicolor models , fermionic kaluza - klein excitations in extra - dimensional models , gauginos in supersymmetric models , etc .",
    "the most important property that we look for is if two phases below ` compete ' for either external ( spacetime ) or internal symmetry breaking : @xmath10 phase i is an electroweak broken but lorentz invariant state , while in phase ii the lorentz symmetry is broken but the electroweak symmetry is restored . for simplicity",
    "we only consider a truncation of the sm4 to one flavor @xmath11 .",
    "our toy model is described by a nambu - jona - lasinio type lagrangian from@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the number of colors .",
    "equation can be obtained as an effective theory from @xmath15 + \\cdots\\ ] ] by integrating out the fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath17 is bjorken s vector field and @xmath18 comes from the truncation of the ` higgs ' field @xmath19 parametrized by @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath21-related terms and other kinetic terms are included in the ellipsis of eq .  .",
    "in the large @xmath22 expansion we can use the mean field approximation at the leading order .",
    "following the standard procedure , one obtains an effective potential@xcite @xmath23 \\\\    & & - \\frac{1}{n \\omega_4 } \\textrm{tr } \\ln \\ { i { \\slashed \\partial } - \\sigma + i { \\slashed a } \\ } + \\mathcal{o}(\\frac{1}{n}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the trace term is @xmath24\\ ] ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the 4-dimensional euclidean space volume . in ref .",
    "the cutoff @xmath27 satisfies @xmath28 .",
    "this relation is quite natural in the sm4 scenario , where the cutoff @xmath27 is taken to be the sm4 quasi - fixed point scale , i.e. @xmath29tev , and @xmath30 is supposed to be the order of @xmath31 gev .",
    "the extrema of the effective potential @xmath32 yields the gap equation which can also be obtained from the schwinger - dyson equation based on eq .  .",
    "does the effective potential allow the phase transition between those two states in eq .  ?",
    "in fact langfeld , reinhardt , and rho have already found@xcite that such a phase transition is possible provided that the chemical potential @xmath33 exceeds a critical value @xmath8 .",
    "here we have a similar mathematical structure , however the physical scale is @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 , and the internal symmetry is the electroweak symmetry instead of the chiral symmetry .",
    "it is probably easier to understand this scaled - up mechanism if we consider the technicolor theories as a scaled - up version of qcd . if @xmath9 does not represent the 4th generation quark but a technifermion instead , one can readily incorporate the lrr mechanism into the technicolor scenario at the scale of @xmath36 and study the ` technihadrons ' for the electroweak symmetry breaking . the effective theory below @xmath36 might as well be described by the same type nambu - jona - lasinio effective action .",
    "if the lorentz violation is determined only by dynamical symmetry breaking , one then expects that a massless vector appears , e.g. , bjorken s emergent gauge boson ( for a systematic study of spontaneous lorentz violation , nambu - goldstone modes and gravity , see ref .  ) .",
    "the diquark condensates can be dynamically generated without triggers , as long as the attraction between quarks becomes strong enough at some energy scale and the resultant vacuum is the global minimum .",
    "the lrr mechanism leads to another possibility : eq .",
    "can be interpreted as the spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking induced by an explicit breaking , since one can always split @xmath37 if @xmath38 and consider the @xmath8 term as the source for the explicit lorentz violation . in this case",
    "the goldstone boson is ` light ' ( compared with the condensation scale ) but not massless , similar to the pion mass in the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "note that this kind of lorentz violation can not be ` gauged ' away as in some theories with ostensibly explicit lorentz violations , since it can modify the vacuum structure and induce a spontaneous lorentz violation .",
    "it could appear as a new gauge boson and be phenomenologically observable at the tev scale . in refs .",
    "the dynamics of a massive vector and its couplings to the sm are studied from the extra - dimension point of view : a new vector field , originally a part of the higher dimensional metric , becomes massive after absorbing the brane fluctuations .",
    "such massive vector also appears in the gauged ghost - condensation models@xcite .",
    "if the goldstone gauge boson from spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking is a condensate of some heavy fermions , its properties may be further investigated by studying the bethe - salpter equation .",
