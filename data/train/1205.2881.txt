    "closure system on a finite set is a unifying concept in logic programming , relational data bases and knowledge systems .",
    "closure systems can be defined by a set of implications ( a basis ) , and in such form they appear as horn formulas in logic programming , dependencies in relational data bases , cnf representations of horn boolean functions and directed hypergraphs in discrete optimization .",
    "closure systems can also be presented in the terms of finite lattices , and the tools of economic description of a finite lattice have long existed in lattice theory . in this paper",
    "we continue the study of economic representation of a closure system based on the structure of its closure lattice , initiated in k.  adaricheva , j.b .",
    "nation and r.  rand @xcite .    since the seminal work of d. maier @xcite , the main parameters of effective representation of a closure system have been ( 1 ) the number of implications in a basis , or ( 2 ) the total number of literals in all implications of the basis .",
    "it was shown by maier , in a non - trivial argument , that the set of implications that achieves the minimum in the second parameter ( an optimum basis ) also achieves the minimum in the first ( a minimum basis ) .",
    "the result of v.  duquenne and j.l .",
    "guigues @xcite is that every closure system has a canonical minimum basis ; moreover , it can be obtained from any given basis in time polynomial in the size of that basis , see a. day @xcite .",
    "quite to the opposite , maier showed that the problem of finding an optimum basis is np - complete @xcite .    on the other hand , in the theory of horn boolean functions and",
    "directed hyper - graphs , other parameters were developed , and no connection with maier s parameters was so far realized .",
    "we establish such a connection in theorem [ main ] , for the minimum representation of a horn boolean function .",
    "then we introduce a @xmath0-basis in general closure systems following the idea of the minimal join representation of elements in finite lattices .",
    "this produces a refinement of the canonical basis of v. duquenne and j.l .",
    "guigues @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath0-basis is not optimum , it does provide a reduction in size of the canonical basis and can be obtained in polynomial time from the canonical basis .",
    "the @xmath0-basis allows us to establish an important link between the canonical basis and the @xmath2-relation in the closure lattice of a closure system : the latter plays an important role in the lattice theoretical literature , see r.  freese , j.  jeek and j.b .",
    "nation @xcite . in particular , the @xmath2-relation can be effectively recovered from the canonical basis via its refinement to any @xmath0-basis .",
    "this allows us to recognize closure systems without @xmath2-cycles ( theorem [ maind ] ) , which are generalizations of the quasi - acyclic systems defined in p.  hammer and a.  kogan@xcite .",
    "we also suggest the general concept of _ partial optimizations _ based on the idea that any basis can always be divided into two natural parts : so - called _ binary _ and _ non - binary_. either of those parts can be optimized given various assumptions .",
    "alternatively , a basis can be minimized with respect to the total size of all the _ premises _ of implications , which we call _ left - side optimum _ , or with respect to the total size of all the _ conclusions _ , which is called _ right - side optimum_. the essential part of the paper is devoted to the study of effective representations of closure systems with unique critical sets , or @xmath3-_systems_. the definition of this class is based on the notion of _ essential _ and _ critical _ sets associated with a given closure system . in one important subclass of such systems ,",
    "the @xmath0-basis is unique .",
    "further refinement in the form of the @xmath1-basis is possible in systems without @xmath2-cycles , which form a proper subclass of @xmath3-systems .",
    "this basis is right - side optimized in its non - binary part .",
    "still , we show that finding an optimum basis for such systems is an np - complete problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we collect all the required definitions and recall important results in section [ prem ]",
    ". then section [ min - opt ] establishes the relationship between optimum and right - side optimum bases ( theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "section [ bin ] deals with the problem of optimization of the binary part .",
    "it turns out , such optimization is independent of the form and size of the non - binary part ( theorem [ rs - bin ] ) .",
    "we also introduce and discuss the concept of a _ regular _ basis ( definition [ regd ] ) that becomes essential in section [ d - rel ] . in section [ kbas ]",
    "we introduce the @xmath0-basis ( definition [ kbs ] ) and describe a polynomial algorithm for retrieving it from the canonical basis ( proposition [ min gen ] ) .",
    "this will be used in section [ kbas sd ] , which discusses the @xmath0-basis in systems with unique critical sets . in section [ d - rel ] ,",
    "a relationship between a canonical basis and the @xmath2-relation on the closure lattice is established ( theorem [ tr ] ) , which allows us to investigate , in sections [ ebas ] and [ opte ] , closure systems without @xmath2-cycles .",
    "the latter form a proper subclass of the class of @xmath3-systems ( definition [ ucsys ] ) .",
    "in particular , we prove that the @xmath1-basis that was introduced in @xcite for closure systems without @xmath2-cycles , is optimized in one of three essential parts of the basis ( theorem [ rs - min ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , two other parts of this basis can not be effectively optimized , which is shown in section [ np ] ( corollaries [ np1 ] and [ srnp ] ) .",
    "given a non - empty set @xmath4 and the set @xmath5 of all its subsets , a _ closure operator _ is a map @xmath6 that satisfies the following , for all @xmath7 :    * increasing : @xmath8 ; * isotone : @xmath9 implies @xmath10 ; * idempotent : @xmath11 .",

    "the lattice operations are denoted @xmath17 , for the _ meet _ , and @xmath18 , for the _ join_. simultaneously , every lattice is a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a least upper bound ( which coincides with the join of those elements ) , and a greatest lower bound ( the meet ) .",

    "there are infinitely many closure systems whose closure lattices are isomorphic to a given lattice @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "the closure system just described is the unique one , up to one - to - one mappings of the base sets , that satisfies two additional properties :    * @xmath34 ; * @xmath35 is closed , for every @xmath36 .",
    "condition ( 2 ) just says that each @xmath37 is join irreducible .",
    "note that ( 1 ) is a special case of ( 2 ) , and that ( 2 ) implies the property    * @xmath38 implies @xmath39 , for any @xmath40 .    we will call a closure system with properties ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) above a _ standard closure system_. it is straightforward to verify that the standard system is characterized by the property that the set @xmath4 is of the smallest possible size . in other words",
    ", one can not reduce @xmath4 to define an equivalent closure system .",
    "there exists a standard procedure to obtain a standard closure system equivalent to a given one , see @xcite .",
    "we will assume that the closure systems in this paper are standard .",
    "if @xmath41 , then this relation between an element @xmath42 and a subset @xmath13 in a closure system can be written in the form of an implication : @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the closure system @xmath12 can be given by the set of implications : @xmath44 conversely , any set of implications @xmath45 defines a closure system : the closed sets are exactly those subsets @xmath46 that _ respect _ the implications from @xmath45 , i.e. , if @xmath47 is in @xmath45 , and @xmath9 , then @xmath48 .",
    "there are numerous ways to represent the same closure system by sets of implications ; those sets of implications with some minimality property are called _",

    "the presence of a positive literal makes a horn clause _",
