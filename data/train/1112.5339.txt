    "recently , the atlas and cms collaborations presented new bounds on the mass of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , excluding values outside the range 115.5  gev - 131  gev @xcite and 115  gev - 127  gev @xcite , respectively , at 95  % confidence level .",
    "while the search for the higgs boson is the primary goal of the lhc , the experimental collaborations are also intensively searching for signs of new physics beyond the sm . among the most popular models describing new physics within the reach of the lhc",
    "is the universal extra dimensions ( ued ) model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "all of the sm fields are promoted to a higher - dimensional spacetime , giving rise to infinite kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) towers .",
    "the lowest - mass kk modes are usually assumed to be located at the tev scale , and in particular , the lightest kk particle could be an interesting dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "an important feature of extra - dimensional models is the impact of the large number of kk modes on the renormalization group ( rg ) running of physical parameters .",
    "the rg running in extra - dimensional models has previously been investigated , e.g. , in refs .",
    "it has been shown that the rg evolution changes from the typical logarithmic running in four - dimensional models to an effective power - law running at high energies .",
    "this means that sizable running could take place at relatively low energy scales .",
    "in particular , the possibility of achieving gauge coupling unification at intermediate energy scales has been discussed @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the rg evolution of the higgs self - coupling constant in order to derive bounds on the minimal five - dimensional ued model , using the recent lhc higgs mass bounds .",
    "previously , results from lhc higgs searches have been used to constrain five- and six - dimensional ued models in refs .",
    "@xcite , giving the bound @xmath0  gev for the minimal five - dimensional ued model .",
    "this corresponds to an upper bound @xmath1  gev on the higgs boson mass from electroweak precision data @xcite .",
    "the rg running of the higgs self - coupling constant has also recently been used to constrain new physics models in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition , we discuss the running of fermion masses and mixing parameters in the ued model , taking the new bounds into account .",
    "these fundamental physical parameters are crucial for building new physics models , as well as testing the feasibility of theories beyond the sm . in fact , since the values of these parameters are not predicted by the sm , new physics , which is usually located at some very high energy scale , is needed in order to gain insight into their origin .",
    "thus , we provide values for the fermion masses and mixing parameters at the cutoff scale of the ued model .    the rest of this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : rge - ed ] , we discuss general features of renormalization group running in extra - dimensional theories .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : higgs ] , we discuss the running of the higgs self - coupling constant and the resulting bounds on the ued model from the lhc higgs mass bounds . then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] , we show the running of the gauge coupling constants and demonstrate that gauge unification can not be achieved within the ued model . in secs .",
    "[ sec : fermionmasses ] and [ sec : ckm ] , we give the rg evolution of the fermion masses and the ckm matrix parameters , respectively . finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] , we summarize and discuss our results . in addition , in appendix [ sec : appendix ] , we provide the one - loop beta functions that are relevant for our work .",
    "a general feature of quantum field theories with extra spatial dimensions is that they are non - renormalizable . however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , such models could preserve renormalizability if they are truncated at a certain energy scale ( i.e. , the number of kk modes is finite ) . in such a situation ,",
    "physical quantities are subject to a power - law running behavior , in contrast to the typical logarithmic running in ordinary four - dimensional theories .",
    "this power - law running may significantly change the running physical parameters , such as the gauge couplings , the quark and lepton masses and mixing angles , and the higgs mass .    in general",
    ", the beta function of a parameter @xmath2 in an extra - dimensional model can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the sm beta function , while @xmath5 corresponds to the contributions from the kk modes at any single kk level to the total beta function . here , it is assumed that the particle content at each non - zero kk level is the same , except for the particle masses .",
    "this is the case in many models , and in particular in the ued model .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the largest integer smaller than @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the inverse radius of the extra dimensions , i.e. , @xmath6 counts the number of kk levels below the energy scale @xmath11 . at energy scales below @xmath12 ,",
    "i.e. , below the mass of the lowest kk excitations , the @xmath5 term can be ignored , whereas for @xmath13 , many kk modes are excited and their contributions change the scale - dependence of the physical parameters from logarithmic to power - law . the relevant one - loop beta functions for the five - dimensional ued model can be found in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .    as mentioned above , in order to make the theory renormalizable , an explicit cutoff scale @xmath14 has to be introduced . from this point of view",
    ", the ued model is an effective description at low - energy scales , which is replaced by a renormalizable theory above the cutoff scale . in the ued model , @xmath14",
    "is usually taken to be the energy scale where the gauge couplings become non - perturbative @xcite , but it could also be related to a unification scale for the gauge couplings @xcite . in this work , we will apply the lhc bounds on the higgs mass to the running behavior of the higgs self - coupling constant in order to put bounds on @xmath14 .    in the following sections , we perform a numerical analysis of the running physical parameters . in our computations ,",
    "we make use of the full one - loop rges without any further approximations .",
    "the input values for the physical parameters , at the energy scale @xmath15 , are taken from ref .",
    "the running of the higgs self - coupling constant @xmath16 in the ued model is given in eq .  .",
    "now , the rg evolution of @xmath16 can be used to constrain the ued model . in particular , for different initial conditions , @xmath16 may approach the triviality limit ( @xmath16 diverges ) , or the vacuum stability limit ( @xmath16 becomes negative , i.e. , the higgs potential becomes unstable ) .",
    "note that a negative @xmath16 does not necessarily mean that the model is invalid , since the electroweak vacuum might be metastable .",
    "in other words , we could live in an unstable vacuum , while the lifetime of the electroweak vacuum is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "however , the metastability limit relies on the fastest process conceived for the transition to the true vacuum , and any faster process occurring once anywhere in the universe would reduce or eliminate the metastability region . for a general discussion on this topic ,",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . using the relation",
    "@xmath17 , this allows us to constrain the parameter space of the ued model using the lhc higgs mass bounds , by requiring that neither the triviality nor the vacuum stability limit is reached below the cutoff scale . in the low higgs mass region allowed by the new lhc bounds ,",
    "only the vacuum stability condition is important for the ued model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] , we present the bounds on the cutoff scale @xmath14 from the requirement of vacuum stability . we show upper bounds on the product @xmath18 , which counts the number of kk levels below the cutoff scale , as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the results depend on the value of the top quark mass @xmath20 , which is only known to an accuracy of a few gev , and therefore , we present our results for @xmath20 in the range 170.9  gev - 173.3  gev .",
    "the weakest bounds are obtained in the phenomenologically interesting range around 1  tev .",
    "we observe that the global upper limit on the number of kk modes in the model is five only , constraining the validity range of the extra - dimensional description significantly .",
    "as we have mentioned , the metastability of the sm vacuum could result in a smaller lower bound on the higgs mass , which is the situation in the ued model . in a semi - classical approximation for @xmath21 , the sm higgs vacuum may still be stable against the age of the universe  @xcite , and thus not in conflict with experimental observations .",
    "this will actually increase slightly the upper bound on @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] . see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed numerical analysis on this issue .",
    "it should also be noted that our results rely on the one - loop beta functions , and would be slightly changed by taking higher - order contributions into account .",
    "nevertheless , we expect our main conclusions to remain valid at higher order .",
    "next , the running of the gauge couplings in the ued model is given in eq .  .",
    "solving this equation , we obtain @xmath22 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] between the @xmath23-th and @xmath24-th thresholds . the second term in eq",
    ".   corresponds to the sm contributions and the last term to the corrections from the kk modes .",
    "note that the expression in the last parenthesis is always positive , e.g. , for @xmath25 one has @xmath26 . in the limit of large @xmath6 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath13 , the evolution of @xmath27 is dominated by the contributions from kk excitations . since the coefficients @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in general not the same , the impact on the rg running from the kk modes is different from that from the sm particles . in particular , the sign of @xmath30 is opposite to that of @xmath31 , indicating that @xmath32 tends to increase at higher energy scales .",
    "in addition , @xmath33 is larger than the other two coefficients , which leads to a fast running behavior of @xmath34 at high energies .    by solving the rges for the gauge couplings ,",
    "we obtain the running of the @xmath35 , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for @xmath36 .",
    "the most interesting feature of this result is that the region where the coupling constants would approximately unify is ruled out by the vacuum stability criterion .",
    "in fact , it turns out that this is a general statement and there is a no - go scenario for gauge unification below the cutoff scale @xmath14 in the ued model . from eq .",
    ", it follows that @xmath37 \\right\\ } \\equiv d_{ij}(m_z ) - \\delta_{ij}(\\mu),\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . by comparing @xmath41 with @xmath42",
    ", we can observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : nogo ] that the ratio never reaches ( or is even close to ) one . in this figure , we have taken the upper limit of the cutoff scale from fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] for @xmath43  gev , which is equivalent to using the global upper limit on @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath44 can never become zero below the cutoff scale , meaning that the gauge couplings @xmath35 and @xmath45 will not unify while the extra - dimensional theory is valid . note that , while higher - order corrections or allowing for a broader uncertainty range in the input parameters could change the actual values slightly , the ratio is quite far away from one and this conclusion should therefore be robust to such details .",
    "as mentioned before , the evolution of the fermion masses is important for constructing new physics models .",
    "therefore , in this section , we give a detailed discussion on the running fermion masses at the cutoff scale for various radii @xmath46 .",

    "the actual meaning of a fermion mass @xmath63 in this energy region is a measure of the corresponding non - trivial yukawa coupling eigenvalue @xmath64 .",
    "we adopt the definition @xmath65 , above the electroweak scale , where @xmath66 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field in the sm .    in view of the hierarchical spectrum of the quark masses ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath67 , one can neglect all of the yukawa couplings except for @xmath68 , and in this approximation , the running of the quark masses is given by the equations @xmath69 m_t \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath70 m_d \\ ; , \\\\ \\label{eq : mqs }      \\dot{m}_s & \\simeq & \\left[\\frac{3}{2}\\left(s^2_{12 } s^2_{13 } c^2_{23}+s^2_{23 } c^2_{12 } + 2s_{12}s_{13}s_{23}c_{12}c_{23 } c_\\delta\\right)\\left(y_t^2 + s y_t^2 \\right ) + \\alpha_d + s \\tilde \\alpha_d \\right ]   m_s \\ ; , \\\\",

    "\\tilde \\alpha_d \\right ] m_b \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the rg evolution equations for @xmath71 and @xmath72 are similar to each other and are both governed by the flavor - diagonal part @xmath73 , whereas for the top quark mass , contributions from @xmath68 should be taken into account , which slightly changes the running of @xmath20 . in the down - type quark sector , the two light quarks @xmath74 and @xmath6 also receive similar rg corrections , since the flavor non - trivial parts [ i.e. , the @xmath68 terms in eqs .   and ]",
    "are suppressed by the ckm mixing angles .",
    "since the @xmath73 parameters are negative , we expect the quark masses to decrease with the energy scale .",
    "as for the charged leptons , we can safely ignore the yukawa corrections due to the smallness of their masses , and we obtain @xmath75 for @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the flavor - diagonal part of the right - hand side of eq .  .",
    "therefore , the charged - lepton masses are essentially rescaled by a common factor at high - energy scales . however , this factor is larger than in the sm , due to the scale parameter @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the quark sector , the flavor - diagonal part @xmath77 is positive , due to the lack of @xmath78 corrections ( i.e. , leptons do not participate in the strong interactions ) , which leads to larger values for the charged - lepton masses at higher energies .    in order to numerically show the rg evolution of the fermion masses , we define the ratios @xmath79 reflecting the rg corrections at the scale @xmath11 .",
    "the scale - dependence of @xmath20 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rf ] , for @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "as expected , the running quark masses decrease with the energy scale .",
    "we observe that the quark masses at the cutoff scale are reduced by about 15  % - 20  % ( c.f . , table  [ table : table - i ] for detailed numbers ) .",
    "therefore , it seems impossible to achieve a reasonably good unification of yukawa couplings , due to the bounds on @xmath14 .",
    "as for the lepton sector , the charged - lepton masses run to larger values at the cutoff scale @xmath14 , e.g. , a 10  % increase of the tau mass can be observed from the plot .",
    "it is also interesting to point out that the values for the running charged - lepton masses  @xcite are maximal at @xmath84  tev - 40  tev ( or equivalently @xmath85 - 40 ) , a region which is not allowed by the new higgs mass bounds .",
    "it should be stressed that the running of the charged - fermion masses is not very sensitive to the specific value for the higgs mass , since @xmath16 does not enter the beta functions for @xmath86 at one - loop level . as a reference for model building ,",
    "we list in table  [ table : table - i ] the running quark and charged - lepton masses at the cutoff scale @xmath14 for @xmath19 = 500  gev , 1  tev , and 10  tev . these numerical values are consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : rf ] , and in general , the evolution of the masses is relatively small due to the strong constraints on @xmath14 .",

    "and we have omitted the charged - lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "an approximate solution to this equation is given by @xmath93 therefore , the rg running of the neutrino masses is only sensitive to @xmath92 , independently of the neutrino mass spectrum and the mixing parameters .",
    "similarly to the charged fermions , we define the ratios @xmath94 for the neutrino masses , and illustrate the evolution of @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ri ] for @xmath96 in the range 115  gev - 130  gev .",
    "an important feature of the running , which can be seen from the plot , is that , due to the stability bounds , @xmath95 can not reach large values below @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the running of the neutrino masses does indeed depend on the higgs mass @xmath96 , since the effective neutrino coupling matrix @xmath90 receives one - loop corrections from the quartic higgs interaction .",
    "the ckm mixing matrix stems from the mismatch between the diagonalization of the yukawa matrices @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the running of the ckm matrix is not sensitive to the flavor - diagonal parts in the beta functions for @xmath86 .",

    "note that current experiments indicate that all the quark mixing angles are relatively small and the ckm matrix takes a nearly diagonal form .",
