    "the meta distribution ( of the sir ) has been proposed in @xcite , where it is applied to both poisson bipolar networks and downlink cellular networks without power control to answer the questions such as `` what fraction of users in a network can achieve a desired link reliability given the required sir threshold ? '' or `` how is the success probability of individual links distributed in each network realization ? ''",
    "such questions are often asked by network operators and indeed of great significance for providing guidance to the practical deployment of the wireless networks .",
    "however , these questions have not been answered analytically for the uplink in cellular networks .",
    "the uplink , compared to its downlink counterpart , is more complex in the network structure and requires power control to maintain the link quality and mitigate the inter - cell interference .",
    "these differences make the analysis of uplink in the framework of the meta distribution more challenging .",
    "meanwhile , since the meta distribution provides more fine - grained information including the variance of the conditional success probability and the mean local delay , etc . , an examination of the effect of power control in the downlink is also warranted .",
    "formally , the meta distribution of the sir in cellular network is defined as @xmath0 , \\label{fps}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the conditional success probability averaged over the fading and the random activities of the interferers given the point process , @xmath2 denotes the palm measure of the point process , given an active receiver at the origin , and the sir is measured at that receiver .    for the meta distribution",
    ", @xmath3 can be interpreted as the reliability , _ i.e. _ , the success probability of the link in consideration given the sir threshold @xmath4 .",
    "the meta distribution corresponds to the fraction of links in each network realization that achieve an sir of @xmath4 with reliability at least @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath6-th moment of @xmath3 ( with regard to the palm measure ) is defined as @xmath7    by this definition and noting that the random variable @xmath8 $ ] , we have @xmath9 with ( a ) following integration by parts , and we easily obtain @xmath10 , _ i.e. _ , the first moment of the conditional success probability is the standard success probability , as expected .      in the analysis of wireless networks with randomly deployed nodes based on stochastic geometry theory ,",
    "the poisson point process ( ppp ) is the most widely used model due to its analytical tractability .",
    "the tractability of ppp is a consequence of the independence between the points , which is formally captured by slivnyak s theorem @xcite .",
    "it also results in a simple expression for the probability generating functional ( pgfl ) @xcite .",
    "most of the existing studies focus on some performance metric as a function of the sir at the typical receiver in the network obtained by averaging over the channel fading and the point process by utilizing the laplace transform of the interference , which is obtained from the pgfl .",
    "however , such a spatial average only yields limited information about the individual links .",
    "in particular , the success probability @xmath11 is one of the most important performance metric of interest , usually being interpreted as the probability that the typical receiver can achieve a target sir threshold .",
    "informally , in stochastic geometry , this `` typical point '' ( the typical receiver ) origins from a selection procedure in which every point of the point process must have the same chance of being selected , hence , the success probability is in fact a result of _ spatial averaging _ over the entire point process .",
    "it can only quantify the overall sir performance of the network , but provides no detailed statistical information for the performance of each individual link in the network . to obtain fine - grained information on the sir and reveal how the success probabilities are distributed among the individual links , the meta distribution of the sir has been formally proposed in @xcite .",
    "the concept of the conditional success probability dates back to @xcite , where it is used to study the local delay in ad hoc networks modeled by ppps . in @xcite",
    "the meta distribution is applied to study poisson bipolar networks with aloha channel access and the downlink of poisson cellular networks , and closed - form expressions of the @xmath6-th moment of the conditional success probability for the two network classes are derived .",
    "in @xcite the conditional success probability is used to study poisson bipolar networks without a channel access scheme . the asymptotic behavior of the distribution is studied and the moments are calculated . in @xcite",
    "the meta distribution is analyzed for the scenario of d2d communication underlaid with the downlink of poisson cellular networks with aloha channel access , and the moments of the conditional sir distribution , the mean local delay of both the typical d2d receiver and the typical cellular receiver are derived .    for poisson cellular networks with the nearest - bs association criterion but no power control ,",
    "the downlink is easy to model and analyze since the interfering bss to the typical receiver form a ppp conditioned on the distance to the serving bs , and , without power control , the aggregate interference experienced by the typical receiver has no relation with the link distances within the interfering cells .",
    "furthermore , the average interfering signal power from each interfering bs is by definition smaller than the average signal power from the serving bs , which simplifies the derivations .",
    "these advantages make the downlink cellular network model thoroughly studied @xcite and easier to be combined with many types of emerging techniques , _ e.g. _ , cooperative transmission @xcite , mimo @xcite , and d2d communication @xcite .",
    "the uplink case is quite different : on the one hand , the interfering user in a neighboring cell can be much closer to a bs than the transmitting user in the cell of that bs ; on the other hand , the interfering user point process seen at the typical bs is not a ppp and hard to model due to the correlation between the voronoi cells of the _ poisson - voronoi tessallation _ and the channel access scheme in each cell .",
    "moreover , due to the different distance ratios between the desired and interfering links compared to the downlink , it can be expected that power control at the user leads to improved performance in the uplink .    for the uplink ,",
    "various models have been proposed to approximate the network performance .",
    "@xcite analyzes the coverage performance in @xmath12-tier uplink poisson cellular networks with truncated channel inversion power control , but the model used there is ill - defined , since the user model is generated from an assumed ppp with `` sufficiently high density '' to make the network fully loaded , , to have an active user in each cell .",
    "also the approximation of the interfering user point process by a homogeneous ppp is inaccurate .",
    "@xcite studies the uplink sir distributions in a two - tier heterogeneous cellular network by considering the effect of a multi - level power control scheme and approximating the interferer locations of a tier as a non - uniform poisson point process , whose intensity at a location @xmath5 is the intensity of the bss in that tier multiplied by a probability factor that if there was a point of the active user process at @xmath5 , it would belong to the voronoi cell of another bs ( of the same tier ) rather than the reference one .",
    "a similar non - uniform ppp approximation with the intensity multiplied by a probability factor is also used in @xcite and @xcite by conditioning on a user at the origin to analyze the full - load case ( , all bss are active ) , but the approximation model is questionable .",
    "firstly , the probability factor is interpreted as the probability that a user is deemed interfering , however , in their user model , which has only one active user per channel per cell , an active user is definitely interfering as long as it is not at the origin ; moreover , conditioning on a given user at the origin but performing spatial averaging over all users means that the user resides in the _ crofton cell _ @xcite , which makes that user not typical among the active users in the network .",
    "@xcite models the interfering user point process as a homogeneous ppp excluding the ball centered at the analyzed bs with the radius determined through matching the average number of excluded points from that homogeneous ppp and the non - homogeneous ppp in @xcite .",
    "again , they rely on the assumption of a ppp with `` sufficiently high density '' , which is impractical and not rigorous .",
    "recently , @xcite defines the point process of active users rigorously and provides a non - homogeneous ppp approximation based on the pair correlation function of the interfering user point process from the typical bs point of view .",
    "this approximation is significantly more accurate than the one in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper makes the following contributions :    * we derive analytical expressions of the @xmath6-th moment for the poisson cellular networks with fractional power control for both uplink and downlink and calculate the analytical meta distribution of the sir for the two scenarios .",
    "* we investigate the effect of the fractional power control on the mean local delay , which is the -1-st moment of the conditional success probability .",
    "* we show that the meta distribution of the sir for both the uplink and downlink poisson cellular networks can be accurately approximated by the beta distribution through matching the first and second moments . *",
    "we reveal the trade - off between the first moment of the conditional success probability and its variance and discuss the optimal operating range of the power control parameter .",
    "we consider a single - tier uplink poisson cellular network of type i in @xcite , where base stations ( bss ) are modeled as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a homogeneous ppp with intensity @xmath15 . by slivnyak s theorem ,",
    "the bs at the origin becomes the typical bs under expectation over @xmath16 .",
    "the spectrum resources are channelized , and each bs is assumed to schedule only one user on each channel .",
    "for a given channel , each user is uniformly distributed in the voronoi cell of the serving bs .",
    "formally , the user point process is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the voronoi cell of bs @xmath19 ; @xmath20 , denotes a point chosen uniformly and randomly from @xmath21 , and independently across different @xmath21 .",
    "the network model is depicted in .",
    "the user served by the typical bs is the typical user , and its location is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "the distance from each user @xmath5 to its own serving bs is denoted by @xmath23 ; for the typical user , the subscript @xmath22 is omitted , so @xmath24 .",
    "we denote the interfering user point process as @xmath25 , given by @xmath26 . the distance from the interfering user located at @xmath5 to the typical bs",
    "is denoted by @xmath27 . the standard power - law path loss model with exponent @xmath28 for signal propagation and the standard rayleigh fading are used . in this case , the power fading coefficients @xmath29 associated with the user at @xmath5 and the typical bs are exponentially distributed variables with unit mean , , @xmath30 .",
    "we assume @xmath31 are independent for all @xmath32 .",
    "we use the fractional power control at the user in the form @xmath33 , which is one of the most widely used schemes for the uplink cellular networks .",
    "the power control exponent @xmath34 $ ] is introduced to partially compensate for the path loss , @xmath35 is the baseline transmit power when there is no power control .",
    "noise is neglected , , an interference - limited scenario is considered .",
    "we shall note that the model used here and the models used by the previous work @xcite , @xcite are similar but have important differnces .",
    "the previous work also considers the full - load uplink scenario and single - user scheduling on each channel . however , their definition of the network model is in accordance with the type ii model in @xcite , while their analysis is performed on the type i model . as we have explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : rw ] , they are actually analyzing the performance of a user in the crofton cell , which means their `` typical user '' is not , in fact , the typical active user .    for our network setup , the uplink sir at the typical bs",
    "is given by @xmath36    for the typical user , @xmath37 , thus @xmath38    to analyze the sir performance , we need to know the statistical properties of @xmath25 and the distribution of the link distances in the network .",
    "[ t ]    . ]      since @xmath39 and the typical user is not an interferer , @xmath25 is a non - stationary process whose intensity depends on the distance from the origin .",
    "its exact statistics are hopeless to derive , but @xcite provides an accurate approximation of its intensity function , given by @xmath40 a non - homogeneous ppp with this intensity function can then be used to approximate @xmath25 , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "* remark 1 * : the earlier work @xcite and @xcite on the uplink scenario approximates @xmath25 by a non - homogeneous ppp with intensity @xmath41 with the factor @xmath42 being interpreted as the probability that a user at the point @xmath5 is interfering to the typical bs at the origin . but as we have indicated in sec .  [ sec : rw ] , this is not accurate , since a user not served by the reference bs , wherever it is located , is for sure an interferer , so this probability is 1 , trivially .",
    "moreover , such an approximation does not take the pair correlation between points in @xmath25 into account , hence it is only a crude approximation",
    ". we can verify this by inspecting ripley s _ k _ function in .",
    "[ t ]     corresponds to ( 5 ) in @xcite and @xmath43 is _ k _ function of the interfering user point process approximated by the non - homogeneous ppp in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both the ripley s _ k _ functions of the standard ppp in theory and that of the interfering user point process at the typical bs by simulation are shown for comparison . ]",
    "it clearly shows that the approximation for the uplink interfering user point process underestimates the number of the interferers in the proximity of the bs ( e.g. , in the range of @xmath44 from 0.4 to 1 ) , yielding an underestimation of the average aggregate interference suffered by the typical bs , while the approximation closely matches the simulation result .",
    "we can also see that the interfering user point process outside a large enough radius of the typical bs approaches the ppp asymptotically and the new approximation also slightly underestimates the @xmath12 function , but this has negligible effect on the interference as the signal power decays quickly with the distance .      for the sir model in",
    ", we use a rayleigh distribution to characterize the link distance distribution according to the method used in @xcite with the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath45 which is obtained by matching the mean of the rayleigh distribution with the empirical mean from simulation .",
    "compared to the link distance in the crofton cell ( @xmath46 in ) , there is a factor 5/4 in this pdf .",
    "@xmath23 should have the same distribution as @xmath47 , however , noting that @xmath23 can not be larger than @xmath48 , we characterize the distribution of @xmath23 by conditioning on @xmath48 to capture the dependency .",
    "this rescults in the truncated rayleigh distribution @xmath49 this truncation partially captures the correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath48 that is present for @xmath5 near the origin",
    ".    * remark 2 : * the earlier work @xcite uses the rayleigh distribution for the distribution of the link distance @xmath47 and a truncated version of the same rayleigh distribution for the interfering link distances @xmath50 , @xmath51 conditioned on the fact @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath54    however , this does not match the uplink network model in use , since is obtained by conditioning on a user at the origin and treating @xmath47 as the contact distance .",

    "it also reveals that the effect of fpc is mainly a _ concentration _ in the user performance levels , which means @xmath88 alone does not give enough information about what parameter to use , but by virtue of the meta distribution , we can obtain more fine - grained information ( e.g. , the variance ) to find the best @xmath84 .",
