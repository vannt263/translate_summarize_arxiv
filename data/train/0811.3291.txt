    "two - dimensional heisenberg kagom antiferromagnet ( 2d hkaf ) is of great interest from the viewpoint of the interplay of the frustration and quantum effects . for the case of @xmath14=1/2 2d hkaf ,",
    "a disordered ground state was observed by various theoretical approaches@xcite .",
    "recent careful analyses and numerical calculations for an @xmath14=1/2 case demonstrated that the ground state is a spin liquid state composed of singlet dimers only , and that the ground state is gapped for triplet excitations , but gapless for singlet excitations@xcite .",
    "consequently , magnetic susceptibility has a rounded maximum at @xmath15 and decreases exponentially toward zero with decreasing temperature , while specific heat exhibits a power law behavior at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "specific heat also shows an additional structure , peak or shoulder at low temperatures after exhibiting a broad maximum at @xmath16 . here",
    ", we use the exchange constant @xmath17 defined as @xmath18    the experimental studies of the @xmath14=1/2 hkaf have been limited .",

    "recently , the herbertsmithite with the chemical formula zncu@xmath1(oh)@xmath3cl@xmath0 with the proper kagom lattice has been attracting considerable attention@xcite . although no magnetic ordering occurs down to 50 mk@xcite , magnetic susceptibility exhibits a rapid increase at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this behavior was ascribed to a large number of idle spins ( @xmath24% ) produced by intersite mixing between cu@xmath13 and zn@xmath13@xcite and/or the dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction@xcite .",

    "these systems undergo structural phase transitions at @xmath25 and 170k , respectively , and also magnetic phase transitions at @xmath26 k@xcite . however , the magnetic susceptibilities observed at @xmath8@xmath27@xmath28 can be perfectly described using theoretical results for an @xmath29 hkaf with rather large exchange interactions @xmath30 k@xcite .    in the present paper ,",

    "the sign and the magnitude of the exchange interactions between cu@xmath13-ions are strongly dependant on the bond angles @xmath41 of the cu@xmath13@xmath33f@xmath34@xmath33cu@xmath13 pathways .",

    "details of the exchange interactions in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 are discussed in the last section .",
    "since the angles @xmath41 in the present systems are sufficiently far from 90@xmath44 where the ferromagnetic superexchange occurs , the nearest - neighbor exchange interactions should be strongly antiferromagnetic .",

    "in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 , since the elongated axes of cuf@xmath3 octahedra incline alternately in the kagom layer , a staggered field should be induced when an external field is applied .",
    "since there is no inversion center in the middle of two neighboring magnetic ions in the kagom layer , the dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interaction is allowed .",
    "the zeeman interaction due to the staggered field and the dm interaction can have finite matrix elements between the singlet ground state and the excited triplet state , because they are antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of the interacting spins .",
    "thus , we infer that the ground state has a small amount of triplet component through these antisymmetric interactions when subjected to the external field parallel to the kagom layer .",
    "this gives rise to the finite susceptibility at @xmath8=0 .",

    "this disagreement should be caused by the four different exchange interactions @xmath77 as depicted in fig.[exchange ] .",
    "since the chemical unit cell of rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 has 12 spins , we carried out the exact diagonalization with 12-site kagom cluster .",
    "since the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction becomes stronger with increasing bonding angle @xmath78 of the exchange pathway cu@xmath13@xmath33f@xmath34@xmath33cu@xmath13 , the condition @xmath79@xmath27@xmath80@xmath27@xmath81@xmath27@xmath82 must be realized in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 . under this condition , we calculated susceptibility .",

    "the levels of the ground and excited states cross at @xmath87 .",
    "the magnetization anomaly at @xmath87 is rather smeared .",
    "we infer that the antisymmetric interactions , such as the staggered zeeman and dm interactions that can mix the triplet state into the singlet state , give rise to the smearing of the magnetization anomaly . we assign the critical field @xmath72 to the field of inflection in @xmath88 .",
    "the critical fields obtained for @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath72=13(1)t and 20(1)t , respectively , which do not agree when normalized by the @xmath83-factor as @xmath89 . when an external field is applied perpendicular to the @xmath31 axis , the magnetic susceptibility is finite even at @xmath8=0 .",
    "consequently , the ground state energy is not independent of the external field but decreases with the external field , resulting in an increase in the critical field . therefore , as the spin gap , we take @xmath90k obtained from @xmath91 t for @xmath50 .",

    ", the spin gap should be smaller .",
    "thus , we infer that the spin gap produced in a kagom layer of cs@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 is so small as to be destroyed by the weak interlayer exchange , which leads to the 3d ordering .",
