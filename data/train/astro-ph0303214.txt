    "in the cooling - flow ( cf ) model of intracluster plasma , radiative cooling causes plasma to flow towards a cluster s center and cool to sub - x - ray temperatures , presumably ending up as either stars , smaller compact objects , and/or cold gas . aside from the gravitational work done on inflowing plasma , heating of intracluster plasma",
    "is neglected in the model , and mass accretion rates @xmath19 are as high as @xmath20 for some clusters ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "a longstanding problem for the cf model has been the difficulty in accounting for all the accreted mass .",
    "for example , the observed rates of massive star formation are a factor of 10 - 100 less than expected if the cooling plasma predicted by the model ends up forming stars with a normal imf ( crawford et  al 1999 , fabian 2002 ) . in addition",
    ", recent x - ray observations find no evidence of plasma cooling to temperatures below 1 - 2  kev ( peterson et  al 2001 , tamura et  al 2001 ) .",
    "these difficulties suggest that some form of heating approximately balances radiative cooling , thereby dramatically reducing  @xmath19 relative to cf estimates .",
    "a number of heating mechanisms have been considered , such as galaxy motions ( bregman & david 1989 ) , supernovae ( bregman & david 1989 ) , cosmic - rays ( bohringer & morfill 1988 , tucker & rosner 1983 ) , active galactic nuclei ( pedlar et  al 1990 , tabor & binney 1993 , binney & tabor 1995 , ciotti & ostriker 2001 , churazov et  al 2002 ) , dissipation of turbulent energy ( loewenstein & fabian 1990 , churazov et  al 2003 , chandran 2003 ) , and thermal conduction , which can transport heat from the hot outer regions of a cluster into the relatively cooler core ( binney & cowie 1981 , tribble 1989 , tao 1995 , chandran & cowley 1998 , narayan & medvedev 2001 , gruzinov 2002 , voigt et  al 2002 , zakamska & narayan 2002 ) . for thermal conduction",
    "to approximately balance cooling , the thermal conductivity  @xmath1 must be a significant fraction of the spitzer value for a non - magnetized plasma ,  @xmath4 , and in some clusters even greater than  @xmath4  ( fabian 2002 , zakamska & narayan 2002 ) , where @xmath21 @xmath22 is the temperature , @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 is the electron density , and  @xmath25 is the coulomb logarithm ( spitzer 1962 ) . is expressed as a diffusion coefficient , the heat flux is given by  @xmath26 . ]",
    "galaxy clusters are filled with tangled magnetic fields with a dominant length scale  @xmath0  kpc ( kronberg 1994 , taylor et  al 2001 , 2002 ) that is much less than the size of a cluster core ,  @xmath27  kpc . both optical - line - emitting gas in clusters and hot intracluster plasma",
    "are observed to be in turbulent motion ( fabian 1994 , churazov et  al 2003 ) .",
    "the effects of turbulent magnetic fields and velocities on  @xmath1 are the subject of this paper , and have been investigated by a number of authors ( e.g. , tribble 1989 , tao 1995 , chandran & cowley 1998 , chandran et  al 1999 , narayan & medvedev 2001 , malyshkin & kulsrud 2001 , gruzinov 2002 ) .",
    "transport in the presence of strong turbulence is a difficult and unsolved problem .",
    "it is likely that the thermal conductivity for a particle species scales like the test - particle diffusion coefficient for that particle species ( rechester & rosenbluth 1978 , krommes , oberman , & kleva 1983 ) : since the collisional transfer of energy between particles occurs locally in space , diffusion of heat accompanies the diffusion of heat - carrying particles .",
    "we thus estimate  @xmath1 in clusters from the relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the diffusion coefficient of thermal electrons and @xmath30 is the thermal - electron diffusion coefficient in a non - magnetized plasma . because they diffuse more rapidly than ions .",

    "we take @xmath29 and @xmath30 to be diffusion coefficients for particles of a specified energy as opposed to diffusion coefficients of a particle that diffuses in energy as well as space .",
    "thus , @xmath32 may scale differently for electrons of energies , e.g. , @xmath33 and  @xmath34 . in the static - field approximation",
    "this is not an issue since @xmath32 is the same for all energies of interest for cluster parameters .",
    "however , when we estimate the effects of turbulent resistivity , we pick a representative energy at which to evaluate @xmath32 as discussed in section  [ sec : rec ] . ]    since thermal electrons in clusters move much faster than the @xmath35 velocity of field lines , a reasonable first approximation for  @xmath29 is obtained by treating the magnetic field as static . in a collisional plasma",
    ", particle diffusion over distances  @xmath2 in a static field depends critically on the rate of separation of neighboring magnetic field lines ( rechester & rosenbluth 1978 , chandran & cowley 1998 ) . if two field lines within a snapshot of strong magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence are at some location separated by a distance  @xmath36 , they will separate by a distance  @xmath7 after some distance  @xmath37 along the magnetic field .",

    "@xmath2 satisfies @xmath38 where @xmath8 is the electron gyroradius .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : kt0 ] ) makes use of the fact that electron motion along the magnetic field is relatively unimpeded by magnetic mirrors and whistler waves excited by the heat flux because the coulomb mean free path is short compared to both  @xmath7 and the temperature - gradient length scale ( see section  [ sec : dpar ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath39 in equation  ( [ eq : kt0 ] ) measures the reduction in  @xmath1 associated with tangled field lines , which increase the distance electrons must travel in going from hotter regions to colder regions .",
    "three previous studies ( jokipii  1973 , skilling , mcivor , & holmes  1974 , narayan & medvedev  2001 ) calculated  @xmath5 for strong turbulence assuming a power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations on scales ranging from  @xmath7 to a much smaller dissipation scale  @xmath11 , which is approximately the proton gyroradius  @xmath40 in galaxy clusters ( quataert 1998 ) .",
    "using different definitions of  @xmath9 , each study found that  @xmath5 is of order  @xmath7 in the small-@xmath41 and small-@xmath42 limits provided @xmath10 is not vastly smaller than  @xmath11 .",
    "jokipii  ( 1973 ) assumed an isotropic turbulent magnetic field and employed a stochastic model of field - line separation , which he solved using a monte carlo numerical method .",
    "skilling et  al  ( 1974 ) assumed isotropic turbulence and introduced an approximate equation of the form  @xmath43 for the average separation  @xmath44 of a pair of field lines , with the function  @xmath45 estimated from the power spectrum of the turbulence .",
    "narayan & medvedev  ( 2001 ) introduced a similar equation for the evolution of the mean square separation , @xmath46 , and estimated @xmath47 using the goldreich - sridhar  ( 1995 )  model of anisotropic mhd turbulence .    in this paper , we calculate  @xmath9 using three different methods .",
    "first , we consider an approximate model in which the separation  @xmath44 of a pair of field lines evolves stochastically and is described by the fokker - planck equation @xmath48 + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\left [ \\left(\\frac { \\langle ( \\triangle y)^2 \\rangle}{2\\triangle l}\\right ) \\ , p\\right ] , \\label{eq : fp0a}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , @xmath50 is distance along the field in units of  @xmath7 , @xmath51 is the increment to @xmath52 after a field - line pair is followed a distance @xmath53 along the field , @xmath54 is an average over a large number of field - line pairs , and @xmath55 is the probability that @xmath52 is in the interval @xmath56 after a distance  @xmath50 along the field .",
    "our model is similar to jokipii s ( 1973 ) , although we determine the functional form of @xmath57 and @xmath58 using the goldreich - sridhar model of locally anisotropic mhd turbulence , and we solve the fokker planck equation analytically , which allows us to determine the functional dependence of  @xmath9 on turbulence parameters . if we evaluate the turbulence parameters in the model using data from direct numerical simulations , we find that  @xmath59 as  @xmath10 is decreased towards  @xmath11 in the large-@xmath12 limit , and that @xmath60 .",
    "our second method for calculating @xmath5 uses a numerical monte carlo model of field line separation in which each random step @xmath51 is of order unity ( the fokker - planck equation assumes infinitesimal markovian steps ) .",
    "when the model parameters are evaluated using data from direct numerical simulations , the monte carlo model gives  @xmath61 in the large-@xmath12 limit .",
    "our third method for calculating @xmath5 involves tracking field - line trajectories in direct numerical simulations of mhd turbulence with zero mean magnetic field .",
    "the results of our highest resolution simulations are consistent with the prediction of the theoretical studies that @xmath5 approaches a value of order several  @xmath7 as  @xmath10 is decreased towards  @xmath11 in the large-@xmath12 limit . extrapolating our numerical results to the large-@xmath12 limit suggests that  @xmath62 in clusters .",
    "field evolution and turbulent fluid motions increase electron ( and ion ) mobility , enhancing  @xmath1 to some degree .",
    "turbulent diffusion in clusters has been studied by cho et  al ( 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we develop a phenomenology to describe the interplay between field evolution and single - electron motion under the questionable assumption that turbulent resistivity completely reconnects field lines on the time scale  @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the rms turbulent velocity .",
    "a similar assumption was explored by gruzinov ( 2002 ) .",
    "we find three limiting cases for the thermal conductivity . for typical cluster parameters and turbulent velocities ( churazov et  al 2003 ) @xmath63 , a value that is somewhat larger than both the turbulent diffusivity  @xmath64 for that cluster and the static - field estimate of @xmath65 .",
    "more work , however , is needed to clarify the role of turbulent resistivity before firm conclusions can be drawn about its effects on  @xmath1 .",
    "additional work is also needed to quantify factors of order unity that have been neglected in estimating  @xmath1 both in the presence of efficient turbulent resistivity and in the static - field approximation .",

    "a tangled magnetic field line is essentially a random - walk path through space .",
    "if a particle is tied to a single field line and travels a distance @xmath73 along the static magnetic field , it takes @xmath74 random - walk steps of length @xmath75 , resulting in a mean - square three - dimensional displacement of @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a constant of order unity ( values of @xmath77 for the numerical simulations used in this paper are listed in table  [ tab : t2 ] ) . when there is a mean field @xmath78 comparable to the rms field , @xmath79 in equation  ( [ eq : tr ] ) is interpreted as the mean - square displacement perpendicular to @xmath80 . if the particle s motion along the field is diffusive with diffusion coefficient @xmath70 , then @xmath81 and  ( rechester & rosenbluth 1978 , krommes et  al 1983 ) @xmath82 indicating subdiffusion : @xmath83 ( see also qin et  al 2002a , b ) .",
    "this process is called double diffusion : the particle diffuses along the field line , and the field line itself is a random - walk path through space .",
    "the vanishing of  @xmath29 for a particle tied to a single field line can be understood by considering a particle starting out at point  p in figure  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "if this particle moves one coulomb mean free path  @xmath71 along its field line  f@xmath84 towards point q and then randomizes its velocity due to collisions , it has a @xmath85% chance of changing its direction of motion along the magnetic field and returning to its initial point  p. in contrast , in a markovian three dimensional random walk , the second step is uncorrelated from the first and there is a vanishing probability that a particle will return to its initial location . in a cluster , @xmath86 ,",

    "suppose an electron starts out at point  p on field line  f@xmath84 traveling towards point  q. after moving a short distance , field gradients and collisions cause the particle to take a step of length  @xmath88 across the magnetic field , from  f@xmath84 to a new field line  f@xmath89 .",
