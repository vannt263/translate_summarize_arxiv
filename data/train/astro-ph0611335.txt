    "diffuse gamma rays in mev@xmath0gev energy region from the inner galactic ( ig ) and outer galactic ( og ) planes observed by egret ( hunter et al .",
    "1997 ) [ 1 ] show a sharp ridge both along the ig and og planes .",
    "the egret flux is about 3 times higher than _ cos  b _ data ( mayer - hasselwander et al . 1982 ) [ 2 ] in several gev , although the flux is consistent with the conventional calculation ( dermer 86 ) [ 3 ] in @xmath1 1 gev .",
    "the egret excess above 1 gev has been tried to explain by some models ; a hard source electron spectrum of index @xmath2=2.0 by pohl & esposito ( 1998 ) [ 4 ] , hard proton spectra by mori ( 1996 ) [ 5 ] and webber ( 1999 ) [ 6 ] , and an additional secondary electrons and positrons raising from the cosmic - ray collisions with ism by strong et al .",
    "( 2004 ) [ 7 ] .    in higher energy region theoretical calculations have been given by porter & protheroe ( 1997 ) [ 8 ] and tateyama & nishimura ( 2001 ) [ 9 ] for the inverse compton ( ic ) gamma rays , and by berezinsky et al .",
    "( 1993 ) [ 10 ] for @xmath3 process through cosmic - ray interaction with ism .",
    "the most experimental data in higher energy region gave only flux upper limits except the definite flux by milagro [ 11 ] at 3.5 tev for ig .",
    "not only the absolute flux but also the flux upper limit are both important for restriction of theoretical models . in this paper , using of the detection area ratio of the tibet array between gamma rays and galactic cosmic rays in the simulation , we revised and decrease the flux upper limits in our previous paper ( 1002 ) [ 12 ] , and compare with the milagro result .",
    "the details of the simulation is described in our recent paper ( amenomori et al .",
    "2006 ) [ 13 ] .",
    "shower size of primary gamma - ray induced showers is about three times larger than galactic cosmic - ray induced ones in average at the d epth of 606 gm@xmath4 of the tibet array for the multi - tev energy region .",
    "hence , the effective area of the array is larger for gamma rays than cosmic rays .",

    "figure 2 is the exposure map of the tibet iii array for the zenith angle of @xmath5 .",
    "figure 3 shows differential energy spectra of triggered gamma induced showers and cosmic - ray induced ones , assuming both spectral index of 2.6 in the simulation .",
    "we can see the mode energy of triggered gamma rays is 1.5@xmath02.0 times smaller than cosmic rays for the same trigger condition , and the effective area ratio to be about 7 in multi - tev region .",
    "figure 4 shows the average advantage factor of the effective area for gamma rays versus cosmic rays is 4.0 for @xmath6 3 tev and 3.6 for 10 tev in average of gamma - ray spectral indices of @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "the mediate value @xmath2=2.5 is employed because of its weak dependence on the spectral index .    the significance of the excess sigma ( @xmath8 ) , in the table 1 , of tev gamma rays from the ig and og planes implies a simple            formula of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of events on - plane and @xmath11 is the background number of events estimated from neighboring bins around the on - plane .",
    "those evaluated values in the previous paper [ 12 ] are tabulated together with the simulated effective area ratio of gamma rays vs. cosmic rays and the revised upper limits in a case of small change of source electron spectral index of @xmath2 from 2.4 to 2.5 .",
    "the present simulation , giving a larger effective area of the tibet array for gamma rays than the galactic cosmic rays , decreases the flux upper limits of diffuse gamma rays by a significant factor , as given in table 1 . the original data in the previous paper ( amenomori et al .",
    "2002 ) [ 12 ] were obtained by the tibet iii array with inner area of 22,050m@xmath12 at 3 tev , and by the tibet ii array with 28,350m@xmath12 at 10 tev .",

    ". 2002 ) [ 16 ] and casa - mia ( c - a ) ( borione et al .",
    "1998 ) [ 17 ] both with 90% c.l .. theoretical curves of inverse compton are given by porter and protheroe ( 1997)[8 ] ( pp2.0 and pp2.4 in figures ) , and by tateyama and nishimura ( 2003)[9 ] ( tn 2.0 and tn2.4 ) , where 2.0 and 2.4 are assumed source electron spectral indices .",
    "theoretical curves arising from @xmath3 decay are also given by berezinsky et al .",
    "( 1993)[10 ] ( bghs ) .    when the observed gamma - ray spectra with the spectral index of 2.5 is adopted in this paper",
    ", the revised results can give a strong suggestion that the spectral indices of source electrons for the inverse compton ( ic ) are steeper than 2.2 in the ig plane and also 2.1 in the og plane in comparison with the theoretical calculations of ic .",
    "recently , milagro ( m ) obtained the definite flux at 3.5 tev from ig plane and the upper limit from og plane .",
    "both are a few times lower than ours . in their ig data",
    "are involved the range of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , though our longitudinal ig range of @xmath18 .",
    "their result suggests that the diffuse gamma rays from the galactic plane can be interpreted not only by ic but also by @xmath3 below 10 tev . the longitudinal range of milagro is larger than our range of 20@xmath19 and the number of events is 3.6 times larger than ours for ig with @xmath17 .",
    "the advantage factor of hadron rejection     for the belt with @xmath14.,width=260 ]     for the belt with @xmath14.,width=260 ]     [ fig_sim ]    of milagro is estimated to be @xmath20 .",
    "thus the effective area ratio of detection of gamma - ray showers vs. hadron showers is 1.45@xmath21 times better than our 99%c.l .",
    "upper limit corresponding to 4 @xmath22 .",
    "their prots of milagro data are lower by a factor of about 4 than ours .",
    "this might be due to an odd analysis method of `` time swapping '' .",
    "otherwise the effective area estimated by milagro is large .",
    "it seems that the recent milagro result [ 11 ] rather claims @xmath3 process by cosmic - ray particles according to the interpretation that their data is on the straight line extrapolated from the data above 10 gev of egret ( hunter et al .",
    "1997)[1 ] .",
    "figure 7 is referred from milagro paper ( atkins et al .",
    "2005 ) [ 11 ] and includes our present revised upper limits for @xmath17 .",
    "this range of the galactic plane covers the cygnus region in which a lot of complicated point sources or diffuse gamma - ray sources seem to be involved .",
    "this is the reason why we have excluded this region from the analysis of the inner galactic plane , and we have been examining the cygnus region separately from ig plane .",
    "recently , we reported our anisotropy result for the multi - tev galactic cosmic rays in the northern sky [ 18 ] . in that paper , a broad hill excess of cosmic - ray intensity",
    "is found in the cygnus region in 13.3@xmath8 , and clear excesses are observable for different energy ranges in the same region .",
    "the tibet as@xmath23 data collected between 1997 and 2001 have been reanalyzed with improved background efficiency calculation by about a factor of 4 . assuming an index of 2.5 for gamma - ray spectrum when calculating gamma - ray efficiency , 99%c.l .",
    "flux limits are derived which suggests that the corresponding source electron spectrum for the inverse compton ( ic ) is steeper than 2.2 for the ig plane and 2.1      for the og plane .",
    "however , those gamma - ray flux limits are too high to constrain proton source models . in the near future",
    ", the broad hill of excess in the cygnus region will be further studied with more available statistic .",
    "as the current tibet air shower array is not able to discriminate the gamma - ray induced air shower from the hadron - induced one , we are planning to add dozens of large water cherenkov detectors in the tibet array , to reject the hadron initiated air showers by using the information of secondary muon .",
    "our gamma ray sensitivity is foreseen to be improved by a factor of 4@xmath010 at 10@xmath0100 tev , while at pev energy we will be free from background [ 19 ] .",
