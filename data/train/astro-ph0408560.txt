    "clusters of galaxies are the largest relaxed concentrations of mass in the universe .",
    "they are interesting for cosmology as they probe the evolution of the large scale structure of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and they are interesting on their own , as we can resolve , probe , and study their inner structure in different frequencies , ranging from microwave to x - rays , and also through weak and strong gravitational lensing of background galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "what adds to this simplicity is that , at least for the massive clusters , almost all of the baryonic matter sits in the diffuse ionized intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , which can be studied theoretically and observationally with relatively simple physics , and give us a census of cosmic baryonic budget ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the microwave signatures of galaxy clusters , the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect @xcite , caused by the scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by hot gas in the diffuse icm , and yielding characteristic spatial and spectral imprints on the cmb sky .",
    "the thermal sz effect has changed from the subject of theoretical studies to that of intense observational endeavor within the past decade , as various experiments have and are being designed to study this effect ( e.g. , apex , act , ami , planck , sza , spt ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview ) .",
    "the main reason behind this wide attention is the potential for using sz detected clusters as standard candles to probe the cosmological evolution up to large redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "compared to the sz detection method , the x - ray detected clusters , which have been primarily used for this purpose until now ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , become much harder to detect at large redshifts , and are also believed to be more affected by complex astrophysics associated with galaxy formation , cooling or feedback within clusters @xcite .    moreover , unlike x - ray observations which only sample regions of high gas density , thermal sz observations probe the distribution of thermal energy in the cluster , and thus provide independent information about the over - all thermal history ( is there an entropy floor ? ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and baryonic budget of the cluster ( are there missing baryons ? ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although various scaling relations of x - ray properties of clusters have been extensively studied in the literature , mainly due to the scarcity , incoherence , or low sensitivity of sz observations of clusters , there have been only a few statistical analyses of sz scaling properties in the literature @xcite .",
    "given the upcoming influx of sz selected cluster catalogs , a good understanding of these scaling relations , and in particular , the sz flux - mass relation ( see  [ szprofile ] ) , which is of special significance for cosmological interpretations of these catalogs ( e.g. @xcite ) , is still lacking .",
    "while the first year data release of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has constrained our cosmology with an unprecedented accuracy , due to its low resolution and low frequency coverage , the sz effect can not be directly observed in the wmap cmb maps @xcite .",
    "one possible avenue is cross - correlating cmb anisotropies with a tracer of the density ( which traces clusters and thus sz signal ) in the late universe @xcite .",
    "in fact , different groups have reported a signature of anti - correlation ( which is what one expects from thermal sz at wmap frequencies ) at small angles between wmap maps and different galaxy or cluster catalogs , at a few sigma level @xcite .",
    "while thermal sz is the clear interpretation of this signal , relating such observations to interesting cluster properties can be confused by the physics of non - linear clustering or galaxy bias .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use an alternative method , where they construct sz templates based on given cluster or galaxy catalogs , and then calculate the over - all amplitude of wmap signal temperature decrement associated with that template .",
    "while the method yields significant sz detections ( 2 - 5@xmath10 ) , the physical interpretation is complicated by the non - trivial procedure that they use to construct these templates .    in this paper , we follow the second line by devising an optimized filter match method based on an analytic model of icm which is motivated by both numerical simulations and observations .",
    "we then apply the method to a sample of x - ray clusters , and construct templates of both sz and potential point source contamination based on the x - ray temperatures of each cluster .",
    "combining these templates with the wmap maps yields constraints on the physical properties of our icm model , namely the icm gas mass fraction , and the dark matter halo concentration parameter .",
    "almost all the sz observations up to date use an isothermal @xmath11 model , obtained from x - ray observations , to describe the cluster sz profile .",
    "however , it has been demonstrated that , as x - rays and sz cover different scales inside the cluster , such extrapolation can lead to errors as big as a factor of @xmath12 in the interpretation of sz observations @xcite . instead ,",
    "@xcite suggest using a physically motivated nfw profile ( see [ model ] ) to model the x - ray and sz observations simultaneously , which in their case , leads to consistent estimates of hubble constant for three different clusters .",
    "we choose to follow their approach in choosing a physically motivated icm model , rather than a mathematically convenient one .    in appendix",
    "a , we introduce a semi - analytic nfw - based model for the icm gas profile .",
    "we then start in [ data ] by describing the wmap cmb temperature maps and our compiled x - ray cluster catalog .",
    "[ model ] derives the theoretical sz / point source templates based on our icm model , while [ cmbstat ] describes our statistical analysis methodology . in [ results ]",
    "we describe the results of our statistical analysis , listing the constraints on gas fraction , concentration parameter , and point source contamination of our clusters .",
    "it the end , [ discuss ] discusses the validity of various assumptions that we made through the treatment , and [ conclusions ] highlights the major results and concludes the paper .    throughout the paper , we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . while no assumption for @xmath15 is made in our analysis of the sz signal , we adopt the value of @xmath16 to compare the x - ray gas fractions with our sz signal .",
    "we use the first year data release of the observed cmb sky by wmap for our analysis @xcite .",
    "the wmap experiment observes the microwave sky in 5 frequency bands ranging from 23 to 94 ghz .",
    "the detector resolution increases monotonically from 0.88 degree for the lowest frequency band to 0.22 degree for the highest frequency . due to their low resolution and large galactic contamination , the two bands with the lowest frequencies , k(23 ghz ) and ka(33 ghz ) ,",
    "are mainly used for galactic foreground subtraction and galactic mask construction @xcite , while the three higher frequency bands , which have the highest resolution and lowest foreground contamination , q(41 ghz ) , v(61 ghz ) , and w(94 ghz ) , are used for cmb anisotropy spectrum analysis @xcite .",
    "@xcite combine the frequency dependence of 5 wmap bands with the known distribution of different galactic components that trace the dominant foregrounds ( i.e. synchrotron , free - free , and dust emission ) to obtain the foreground contamination in each band .",
    "this foreground map is then used to clean the q , v and w bands for the angular power spectrum analysis .",
    "similarly , we use the cleaned temperature maps of these three bands for our sz analysis .",
    "we also use the same sky mask that they use , the kp2 mask which masks out 15% of the sky , in order to avoid any remaining galactic foreground .",
    "however , we _ stop short of _ masking out the 208 identified wmap point sources , as many of them happen to be close to our clusters . for example , there are 29 wmap identified microwave sources within 3.6 degrees of 66 of our clusters .",
    "instead , we decide to model the point source contamination based on its frequency dependence ( [ secps ] ) .",
    "the wmap temperature maps and mask are available in the healpix format of spherical coordinate system @xcite , which is an equal - area pixelization of the sphere .",
    "the resolution of the first year data is @xmath17 , implying @xmath18 independent data points ( in lieu of masks ) and @xmath19 sized pixels , for each sky map .",
    "our objective is to study the sz signal in a large sample of galaxy clusters . to this end , we have assembled our sample from several existing x - ray cluster samples @xcite , as x - ray observations may provide reliable cluster mass estimates , and avoid false detections due to chance projections .",
    "the selection criteria require that the clusters ( 1 ) must have _ measured _ x - ray emission weighted mean temperature ( @xmath20 ) , ( 2 ) are reasonably away from the galactic plane ( galactic latitude @xmath21 ) , and ( 3 ) are at least 3 degrees away from the galactic foreground kp2 mask ( [ wmap ] ) .",
    "the redshift information is obtained from ned and/or simbad , and the above catalogs .",
    "the cluster temperature is taken from the literature cited above , primarily the study of @xcite .",
    "we have adopted the @xmath20 obtained when the central cool core region is excluded , and identify the peak of the x - ray emission ( either from the cluster catalogs or from archival _ rosat _ images ) as the cluster center .",
    "our final cluster catalog contains 117 nearby clusters , ( @xmath22 ) , whose temperature ranges from 0.7 to 11 kev .",
    "our requirement that clusters have measured @xmath20 is to provide reliable mass estimates . given @xmath20 , the observed mass - temperature relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter frb01 ) @xmath23 can be used to obtain @xmath24 , the mass enclosed by @xmath25 , within which the mean overdensity is 500 times the _ critical density _ of the universe @xmath26 .",
    "the wide range of cluster temperature in our sample implies that our clusters span two orders of magnitude in mass .    in order to facilitate comparisons of our sz - derived gas fraction with the x - ray measurements ,",
    "we compile the gas mass ( within @xmath25 ) for most of our clusters from the literature @xcite , supplemented by the data based on the study of @xcite .",
    "the gas masses provided by @xcite are measured at a fixed metric radius of @xmath27 mpc ; we convert it to the nominal radius of @xmath25 by the measured @xmath11-model profile , and then to the virial radius @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ; see [ model ] ) , using the analytic model of [ model ] .",
    "( [ zrvir ] ) shows the distribution of redshifts and virial radii for our clusters ( using the analytic model of [ model ] for dark matter concentration @xmath30 ) .",
    "the solid lines show the resolution limits of the three wmap bands , as well as the physical radius of the 1 degree circle at the cluster redshift .",
    "we see that most of our clusters are in fact resolved in all the wmap bands .",
    "in appendix a , based on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and nfw dark matter profile @xcite , we develop an analytic model for the gas and temperature distribution in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) . in this model , assuming a given nfw concentration parameter , @xmath31 , all the properties of the cluster / icm are quantified in terms one parameter , which , can be taken to be e.g. , the cluster virial mass , @xmath32 , or its x - ray temperature @xmath20 ( see equations [ delta ] and [ tx ] for definitions ) . in particular , @xmath32 can be expressed in terms of ( the observed ) @xmath20 ( equation [ tx ] ) , to be the emission weighted temperature in our model .",
    "we address the error introduced due to this assumption in [ model_unc ] . ] within the model for a given value of @xmath31 .",

    "since the sz signal has a small frequency dependence at the range of wmap frequencies ( @xmath55 ) , we can use this frequency dependence to distinguish the point source ( ps ) contamination from the sz signal . to do this ,",

    "another source of error , which is not included in the covariance method , is the uncertainty in observed x - ray temperatures .    in order to obtain more accurate error estimates",
    ", we use our primary cmb power spectrum ( from cmbfast ) , combined with the wmap noise and beam properties to generate 99 monte - carlo realizations of wmap cmb maps in its three highest frequency bands ( q , v , & w ) . neglecting the contamination of cluster signals by background points sources , these maps",
    "can then be used to estimate the error covariance matrix for our @xmath86 and @xmath56 estimators , within an accuracy of @xmath87 .    to include the impact of @xmath20 errors in our monte - carlo error estimates , we assume an asymmetric log - normal probability distribution for the true temperature , @xmath88 , which is centered at the observed value , @xmath89 , and its extent on each side is given by the the upper / lower error of the observed temperature , @xmath90/@xmath91 , i.e. ( t_x )",

    "@xcite is the only other group which expresses its sz observations in terms of sz flux - temperature relation .",
    "our result is consistent with their observations , within the relevant temperature range ( @xmath112 for their sample ) .",
    "this is despite the higher median redshift of their sample ( @xmath113 ) , which may indicate no detectable evolution in the sz flux - temperature normalization .",
    "their scaling with temperature , however , is significantly shallower than our measurement ( @xmath114 ) , which is in contrast with our scaling ( @xmath115 ) , at more than @xmath2 level .",
    "this is most likely due to the difference in the range of temperatures that are covered in our analysis .",
    "indeed , the clusters in our three highest temperature bins whose temperature coincides with that covered in @xcite show a much shallower dependence on temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fgbin ] ) , which is consistent with their results .",
    "we should note that we have to use our icm model of [ model ] to convert @xmath116 to a flux within a much smaller area , @xmath117 , which is reported in @xcite .",
    "the conversion factor is @xmath118 and @xmath119 for @xmath98 and @xmath120 respectively .    as to comparison with numerical simulations of the icm , even the most recent studies of the sz effect in galaxy clusters",
    "@xcite include only a handful of clusters above @xmath121 .",
    "this is despite the fact that most observational studies of the sz effect , including the present work , are dominated by clusters with @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , a direct comparison of our observed sz fluxes with numerical studies is not yet feasible . instead , we can compare the sz fluxes for clusters around @xmath123 , where the temperature range of observed and simulated clusters overlap . making this comparison",
    ", we see that , for the few simulated clusters with @xmath124 in @xcite the sz fluxes are in complete agreement with our observations .",
    "however , clusters of @xcite are underluminous in sz by close to an order of magnitude .",
    "indeed , @xcite also notice a similar discrepancy with the sz observations of @xcite .",
    "the fact that the results of @xcite are inconsistent with other simulations and observations , may be indicator of a flaw in their analysis .",
    "it is clear that the assumption of constant concentration parameter , @xmath31 , which we have adopted up to this point , is an oversimplification .",
    "the average value of the concentration parameter is known to be a weak function of the cluster mass in cdm simulations ( @xmath125 ; e.g. , nfw , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; even for a given mass , it follows a log - normal distribution @xcite , which may also depend on mass @xcite .    as discussed at the end of [ cmbstat ] , we can repeat our monte - carlo template making procedure for different values of @xmath31 , which yields quadratic expressions for @xmath61 , and thus enables us to ( after marginalizing over @xmath56 ) draw likelihood contours in the @xmath126 plane . from table ( [ global_tab ] ) , we see that most of our sz signal is due to the clusters with @xmath127 ( see also table [ binned_tab ] ) , while @xmath31(@xmath128 ) is expected to stay reasonably constant in this range .",
    "therefore , we restrict the analysis to this sample . fig .",
    "( [ cfh ] ) shows the result , where we have explicitly computed the @xmath61 for integer values of @xmath31 , and then interpolated it for the values in - between .",
    "the solid contours show our @xmath129 and @xmath130 likelihood regions ( @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) .",
    "we see that our data can constrain the concentration parameter of the dark matter halos to @xmath8 ( median @xmath133 @xmath134 percent likelihood ) .",
    "the dotted contours show the same likelihoods expected for clusters hotter than @xmath135 in the wmap concordance model , where @xmath136 is the upper limit expected from the wmap concordance cosmology @xcite , while the range of @xmath137 is based on an extension of the top - hat model @xcite for the same cosmology , averaged over the masses ) is a function of @xmath137 itself , but the uncertainty introduced in cluster mass estimates as a result , only slightly affects the obtained concentration range . ] of our cluster sample , and inversely weighted by the square of temperature errors .",
    "we see that , while the mean gas fraction is about @xmath92 ( @xmath138 ) smaller than the cosmic upper limit ( see the 2nd row in table [ global_tab ] ) , our inferred constraint on @xmath137 is completely consistent with the prediction .",
    "in [ results ] , we demonstrated that , while we are able to detect the thermal sz effect at the 7 - 8@xmath10 level from the first year data release of wmap temperature maps , the inferred gas fractions are typically smaller than the x - ray estimates , as well as the cosmological upper limit ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the sz ( as well as x - ray ) observations have been often used , in combination with the nucleosynthesis bound on @xmath140 , to constrain @xmath141 , through replacing the upper limit by equality @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , similar to our finding , such determinations have consistently yielded lower values than , the now well - established , upper limit . in fact ,",
    "cooling and galaxy formation do lead to a depletion of the icm gas . to make the matters worse",
    ", supernovae feedback can make the gas profile shallower , also leading to smaller baryonic fraction within a given radius .",
    "_ after all , clusters may not be such accurate indicators of the baryonic census in the universe .",
    "_ we note that these processes will affect low mass clusters more strongly than high mass ones , and therefore it is natural to expect the massive clusters to be better representative of the cosmic baryonic content .",
    "indeed , x - ray - based determinations of the ratio of cluster gas to virial mass ( for massive clusters ) have seemingly been more successful in reproducing the cosmic average ( after @xmath142 correction for stars ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we should note that , as the x - ray emissivity is proportional to the square of local plasma density , any smooth modeling of the icm which may be used to infer the gas mass from the x - ray map of a cluster , tends to overestimate this value due to the contribution of unresolved structure to the x - ray emissivity ( i.e. @xmath143 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations can suffer from the same problem , and thus fail to estimate the full magnitude of the effect .",
    "there are several factors which can account for the discrepancy between the gas fractions determined here and those estimated from previous x - ray studies .",
    "firstly , since direct detection of x - rays from the icm is rarely possible near the virial radius , a significant degree of extrapolation is required to infer gas properties at @xmath28 .",
    "x - ray studies typically assume a @xmath11-model form for the gas distribution , with an empirically - motivated index parameter of @xmath144 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , implying @xmath145 at large radii .",
    "by contrast , our physically - motivated model for the gas density ( eq.[rhogas ] ) yields @xmath146 at large radii , which produces a lower gas mass within @xmath28 . secondly , the dark matter concentration is likely to be higher than both values assumed here in less massive halos , as a consequence of hierarchical formation .",
    "this underestimation of @xmath147 correspondingly underestimates @xmath148 .",
    "thirdly , the effects of non - gravitational heating on the icm in cooler clusters can act to displace the gas beyond the radius where we observe it directly @xcite .",
    "consequently , extrapolating to @xmath149 based on the resulting lower - density gas that is observed will lead to an underestimate of the total gas mass .",
    "the difference in logarithmic slope of @xmath150 at large radius between a @xmath11-model with @xmath144 and eq .",
    "( [ rhogas ] ) is partly due to the effects of non - gravitational physics biasing the gas distribution with respect to the dark matter .",
    "however , there is some evidence that @xmath11 may increase at larger radius in some @xcite , although not all @xcite clusters , which would reduce the discrepancy .",
    "however , satisfactory resolution of this issue will require mapping of the gas distribution out to the virial radius in a representative sample of clusters ; a task which is complicated by the large angular size and low surface brightness of the outer regions of the icm .",
    "the relationship between the observed sz flux and the icm gas fraction ( eq . [ szflux ] ) , relies on the accuracy of the ( electron ) virial temperature - mass relation ( eq .",
    "[ tvir ] ) . although our x - ray temperature - mass relation ( eq .",
    "[ tx ] ) is consistent with observations , the ( emission weighted ) x - ray temperature only probes the inner parts of the cluster , and there can still be significant deviations from our simple picture of the uniform icm in the cluster outskirts .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that , compared to a uniform homogeneous accretion , inhomogeneous accretion will inevitably lead to smaller entropy production .",
    "although this may not significantly affect the central part of a cluster , it can significantly change the boundary condition ( see eq .",
    "[ temp ] ) behind the accretion shock .",
    "this can be also interpreted as incomplete virialization which can lead to smaller virial temperatures .",
    "let us estimate how much error the model uncertainties may introduce to our measurements . neglecting the contribution of radio sources ( see [ rss ] ) , we can divide the model uncertainties into the sz profile shape , and sz flux uncertainties .    in [ results ] , we saw that assuming @xmath30 instead of @xmath98 may result in @xmath151 difference in the inferred gas fraction . with",
    "the exception of merging clusters , given the low resolution of wmap maps , this is the level of error that we expect may be introduced due to the uncertainty in the profile shape .    as to the sz flux uncertainty in our model ( equation [ szflux ] )",
    ", we note that the inferred @xmath20 dependence of the sz flux hinges upon the accuracy of our x - ray temperature - mass relation ( equation [ tx ] ) . parameterizing this as = a t^3/2_x , in appendix a , we argue that the systematic uncertainty / error in @xmath152 is @xmath151 , i.e. @xmath153 . as the total sz flux is proportional to the estimated virial mass , we also get = aa ~0.1.moreover , the virial radius of the cluster , which is crucial in our matched filter method , is modified according to ^1/3 = a^1/3 t^1/2_x , yielding = = ( aa ) ~0.03 .",
    "[ dcv]the sz template is then given by s ( ) = ( s_tot d^2_a ^2 ) ( d_a/ ) , where @xmath154 is the normalized sz ( integrated pressure ) profile in our model ; see appendix a. ] : ( x ) = ^1_x f(y)g(y)2 ^1_0 f(y)g(y)y^2dy .",
    "therefore , the systematic error in the estimated @xmath96 is given by : = -s s = -a a ~-0.1 , where we used equation ( [ dcv ] ) , and the fact that @xmath155 in cluster outskirts , where most of the sz signal comes from .",
    "therefore , we see that the expected level of systematic error due to the theoretical uncertainty in the sz profile / flux is @xmath156 , which is comparable to our random error . however , the similar systematic error in our constraints on @xmath31 ( @xmath157 ; equation [ dcv ] ) , is significantly smaller than the associated random error .",
    "further complication may be introduced by the fact that , as a result of icm inhomogeneities and incomplete frequency coverage , the observed x - ray temperature , @xmath20 , could be different from the emission weighted temperature , @xmath158 , derived in appendix a. recently , @xcite defined a _ spectral - like _ temperature , @xmath159 , which can approximate the observed @xmath20 to better than a few percent , and @xcite claim that , in hydrodynamic n - body simulations , @xmath159 can be lower than @xmath158 by as much as 20 - 30% .",
    "however , applying the definition of @xmath159 to the analytic model of appendix a ( which is clearly less structured than both simulations and observations ) , we find that @xmath159 is smaller than @xmath158 by only @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , we can ignore the impact of this discrepancy in our analyses .",
    "finally , another possibility is the breakdown of local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) in the cluster outskirts .",
    "while the hydrodynamic shocks heat up the ions instantly , the characteristic time for heating up the electrons ( via coulomb interactions ) can be significantly longer @xcite , and thus the electron temperature can be lower by as much as @xmath161 in the outer parts of clusters . since the thermal sz effect is proportional to the electron temperature , the breakdown of lte can be a source of low sz signals .",
    "interestingly , the effect is expected to be bigger for more massive clusters which have longer coulomb interaction times .",
    "while we assumed an exactly flat spectrum for all our point source contamination , a more realistic model would include a random spread in the spectral indices @xmath162 of the point sources .",
    "in fact , although the average spectral index of the wmap identified sources is zero ( flat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is a spread of @xmath163 in @xmath162 of individual sources .",
    "moreover , although most of the bright microwave sources have an almost flat spectrum , an abundant population of faint unresolved sources may have a different spectral index , and yet make a significant contribution to the cluster microwave signal .",
    "for example , a vla survey finds that for sources with flux @xmath164 jy , the mean spectral index distribution ( within @xmath165 ghz ) can be described by a gaussian whose mean and dispersion are @xmath166 and 0.34 , respectively @xcite . at fainter flux limit ( @xmath167 mjy )",
    ", the cbi experiment finds that the mean index ( from 1.4 to 31 ghz ) is @xmath168 , with maximum and minimum indexes being 0.5 and @xmath169 , respectively @xcite .    in order to test the sensitivity of our sz signal to the point source spectrum",
    ", we repeat the analysis for the spectral power indices of @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "our over - all sz signal changes by less than @xmath172 , implying the insensitivity of our results to the assumed spectrum .",
    "the average luminosity in the microwave band of cluster galaxies also does not sensitively depend on our choice of the spectral index .",
    "for example , assuming @xmath173 , as most studies in low frequencies adopt ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we find that at 41 ghz the luminosity changes less than 10% to @xmath174 .    finally , it is interesting to compare our inferred galaxy luminosity at 41 ghz with that observed at lower frequencies . a recent study of a large sample of nearby clusters has determined the cluster agn luminosity function ( lf ) at 1.4 ghz @xcite , which is in agreement with the bivariate lf obtained by @xcite ; it is found that the cluster lf is very similar to that of the field , once the difference in the overdensity has been taken into account . integrating the lf from @xmath175 to @xmath176 erg / s / hz",
    "( corresponding to the observed luminosity range of agns ) and multiplying by the cluster volume gives the total luminosity @xmath177 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "for a @xmath178 cluster , @xmath179 erg / s / hz , which can be compared to the total luminosity inferred from our result @xmath180 ( c.f .",
    "eqn  [ eq : nm ] ) .",
    "assuming @xmath181 , we find @xmath182 erg / s / hz ; with @xmath173 , @xmath183 erg / s / hz .",
    "this exercise suggests that a typical spectrum of @xmath184 brings our results into good agreement with the 1.4 ghz measurements .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply the spectral shape to be similar within the frequency range that is relevant to our analysis ( 41 to 94 ghz ) .",
    "the fact that changing @xmath185 from 0 to @xmath186 affects @xmath187 less than 10% suggests our analysis is robust against specific choices of the spectral index .    an alternative to this picture",
    "is drawn in @xcite , where it is proposed that a significant part of the point source microwave emission in sky may come from faint ( radiatively inefficient ) accretion flows around supermassive black holes in early - type galaxies .",
    "the assumed microwave luminosity per early - type galaxy in their model is @xmath188 , which is consistent with our results , if less than @xmath189 of cluster galaxies with @xmath190 are early - type galaxies with microwave luminosities at this level . using the luminosity function of near infrared galaxies , we find that the number density of early - type galaxies @xcite with @xmath6 ( @xmath191 ) is indeed close to the number density of early - types assumed in @xcite , which is @xmath192 .",
    "a nearby optical study of galaxy population in clusters suggests that the early - type fraction in clusters is @xmath193 , and does not show strong variation with cluster - centric distance @xcite .",
    "based on this finding , we compute the average early - type fraction for galaxies with @xmath194 from the type - specified luminosity functions of @xcite , and assume that it roughly stays the same within cluster virial radii .",
    "the obtained fraction is @xmath195 , which suggests that our observed microwave point source luminosity is consistent with the characteristics of the faint accretion flows proposed in @xcite .",
    "in this work , using a semi - analytic model of the intra - cluster medium , we devised a monte - carlo based optimal filter match method to extract the thermal sz signal of identified x - ray clusters with measured x - ray temperatures .",
    "we apply the method to a catalog of 116 low redshift x - ray clusters , compiled from the literature , and detect the sz signal , at @xmath0 level ( random error ) , while we estimate a comparable systematic error due to model uncertainties .",
    "we also see a @xmath4 signature for point source contamination , which we model based on the assumed spectral characteristics and spatial distribution of point sources .",
    "it turns out that the average luminosity of bright cluster members ( @xmath6 ) is comparable to that of milky way and andromeda .",
    "while our observed sz signal constrains the gas fraction of the intra - cluster medium to @xmath196 of the cosmic average , it is completely consistent with the gas fractions based on our compiled x - ray gas mass estimates .    based on our results",
    ", we also derive the sz flux - temperature relation within the temperature range of @xmath197 , and compare it with other numerical / observational studies . while our findings are consistent with other sz observations , the range of cluster temperatures covered by numerical simulations is too low to permit any meaningful comparison .",
    "finally , after marginalizing over gas fraction and point source contaminations , we could constrain the average dark matter halo concentration parameter of clusters with @xmath9 to @xmath198 .    turning to the future prospects , in the short term , the use of wmap 4-year maps should decrease our errors on @xmath96 and concentration by a factor of @xmath199 .",
    "fig.([abundance ] ) shows the estimated number of observed clusters with @xmath200 , within different temperature bins , which is compared to the sample with measured temperatures used for this analyses .",
    "this shows that , even within the range of temperatures and redshifts resolved by wmap , there are many more clusters that can be included in the analyses , if their temperatures are measured .",
    "therefore , adding more clusters with observed x - ray temperatures to our catalog , e.g. , from current and future chandra observations , will increase the significance of our constraints .    in the long run",
    ", this work serves as an example to show the power of combining extragalactic observations in different frequencies in putting independent statistical constraints on the physical models of systems under study .",
    "more specifically , we have demonstrated that despite their low resolution , through combination with x - ray data , wmap all - sky maps are capable of constraining the icm physics at a comparable level of accuracy to their much higher - resolution pointed counterparts ( e.g. , ovro and bima ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) therefore , we predict that the scientific outcome of future high resolution cmb / sz observations ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be greatly enhanced through direct combination / correlation with a wide - angle deep x - ray survey , such as nasa s proposed dark universe observatory ( duo ) .",
    "it is needless to say that more accurate observational constraints on the icm need to be supplemented by more sophisticated theoretical models which should be achieved through large and high - resolution numerical simulations .",
    "such simulations are yet to be realized ( see [ szft ] ) .",
