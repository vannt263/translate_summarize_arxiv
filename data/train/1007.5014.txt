    "study of isotope shifts ( iss ) in atomic systems has been a long time immense interest to the physicists @xcite .",
    "it is a challenging problem to find out the role of the correlation effects in the is calculations using an _ ab initio _",
    "approach for a system involving more than three electrons .",
    "the most difficult part in is determination lies in calculating the specific mass shift ( sms ) which involves two - body interactions between the electron momenta @xcite and treating correlation effects to all orders in this property is as difficult as considering the coulomb interaction between the electrons .",
    "often semi - emperical methods @xcite have been used to calculate these properties without describing the electron correlation behaviors .",
    "there have been a number of works carried out using the non - relativistic theories to include the correlation effects that consider particular type of correlation effects to all orders and some of the correlation effects are taken only up to finite order @xcite .",
    "studies of iss are important in a number of applications ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics @xcite .",
    "accurate determination of these quantities in combinations with the corresponding measurements can be used to extract the relative root mean square ( rms ) nuclear charge radii of different isotopes that can not be measured directly @xcite .",
    "they are also used to test various nuclear models @xcite . since the rms radii variation in the considered systems",
    "can be determined precisely using the nuclear models due to small sizes of their nuclei , we will not focus our studies in that direction here .",
    "again , some of the iss are also used to probe the isotopic abundances of different elements in the astronomical objects @xcite .    in another context , it is believed that there is possibility of space - time variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath1 at the cosmological scale @xcite .",
    "this can be verified by analyzing the quasar absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to find out any variation of @xmath2 by comparing the measurements of the ratios of the fine structure intervals to the optical transition frequencies in the laboratory experiments and that from some distant astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "any difference in these results can be related to the space - time variation of @xmath2 . however , the frequency shifts that corresponds to such transitions are of the same order of magnitude with the possible isotope shifts in the elements present in the astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "any changes in the isotope abundances in these objects will be the systematic errors in the finding of @xmath2 variation @xcite . as suggested by kozlov _",
    "et al _ @xcite it is possible to construct anchor lines , those are insensitive to the variation of abundances in the astrophysical objects , and probe lines , those are insensitive to the @xmath2 variation .",
    "it is also possible to construct such lines by considering combinations of suitable transitions of the elements present inside the astrophysical objects @xcite . to find out the sensitive lines to @xmath2 variation and/or strong is in any system , it is necessary to determine the @xmath2 variation coefficient @xmath3 and is parameters , respectively , as defined explicitly below .",
    "since both na and mg@xmath0 are proposed as suitable candidates for this purpose @xcite , we would like to determine these properties accurately in the above systems .",
    "there are three relativistic many - body methods have already been used to calculate the is constants in the considered systems @xcite .",
    "safronova and johnson have used at most two orders of coulomb interactions through the third order many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt(3 ) method ) to calculate the iss and the trends of different electron correlation effects are presented at this level of approximation @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have considered the is operators in the atomic hamiltonian with a varying parameter , then they calculate the energies self - consistently .",
    "changes in the energies are estimated to the first order in that parameter to extract the corresponding iss .",
    "however , it is not possible to find out the role of different electron correlation effects through this procedure . the individul field shift ( fs ) and specific mass shift ( sms ) results reported by these two methods do not match well with each other although the final iss reported by both the works are close to the experimental measurements .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is a large cancellation between the initial state and final state results .",
    "however , it does not really explain the reason of discrepancies at the individual result .",
    "korol and kozlov @xcite have followed approach considered by dzuba _",
    "et al . _ and present only the final results without giving details of the correlation contributions .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to employ a relativistic many - body method that accounts correlation effects to all orders and it enables us to understand the underlying role of different correlation effects in these calculations . to fill - up the gap between the differences in the individual results reported by safronova and johnson and berengut _ et al .",
    "_ , we follow an approach similar to safronova and johnson but consider atomic wavefunctions determined using the relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) theory which is an all order perturbation method having size consistent property @xcite .",
    "the catagorily distinct features of this work are : ( i ) it will explain the differences between the results reported in @xcite and @xcite , ( ii ) it will present individual contributions from various correlation ( rcc ) terms to both fs and sms constant calculations and ( iii ) it will give @xmath3 and iss of many low - lying transitions in the considered systems those are not studied in the literature to date .    the remaining part of this paper is arranged as follwing : in the next section we will give the general theory of fine structure constant variation and iss in the atomic systems . in the following section , we will explain the many - body techniques in the rcc framework that has been used to calculate the energies and is properties . in sec .",
    "iv , we will present the results and discuss them by comparing with the earlier results . in the last section",
    ", we will summarise our work and draw the conclusions .",
    "the is ( @xmath4 ) to an energy level of state @xmath5 in an atomic system is mainly classified into two parts : ( a ) the shifts ( @xmath6 ) due to the consideration of finite nuclear mass that is known as mass shift ( ms ) and ( b ) the shifts ( @xmath7 ) caused due to change in the nuclear charge radius from one isotope to another , known as fs .",
