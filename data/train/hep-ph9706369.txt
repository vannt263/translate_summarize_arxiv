    ", a non - relativistic approximation is used to describe the binding of the heavy - quark pair , produced via parton - fusion processes , into a quarkonium state .",
    "the heavy - quark pair is projected onto a physical quarkonium state using a colour - singlet projection and an appropriate spin projection .",
    "experimentally , @xmath1 production is measured most easily through the detection of the leptonic decays .",
    "then , the inclusive @xmath1 yield consists of the prompt @xmath1 production and the production of the @xmath3 @xmath4 states @xmath2 @xmath5 , which decay electromagnetically into the lower - lying @xmath1 state .",
    "the latter must also be taken into account if one wishes to compare theoretical predictions with experiments where @xmath2 production could not be measured separately .",
    "the csm has been successfully applied @xcite to explain large-@xmath0 @xmath1 production at the relatively low energies ( @xmath6  gev ) of the cern isr experiments .",
    "after the advent of the cern @xmath7 collider with @xmath8  gev , it was found @xcite that also the production of bottom quarks and their subsequent weak decay into @xmath1 mesons is an important source of @xmath1 production . in the ua1 experiment , it was not possible to separate the bottom - quark contribution .",
    "later , the cdf and d0 collaborations , when measuring @xmath1 production at the fermilab tevatron ( @xmath9  tev ) , were able to subtract the bottom - quark contribution from the total yield .",
    "since also the yield of the @xmath2 mesons decaying into @xmath1 mesons could be separated , a measurement of prompt @xmath1 production at large @xmath0 was possible .",
    "( we shall use the term _ prompt _ instead of _ direct _ to denote all @xmath1 mesons not originating from decays , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath10-meson or @xmath2 decays . )",
    "the cross section of prompt inclusive @xmath1 production measured by cdf and d0 @xcite turned out to be an order of magnitude larger than the prediction of the csm .",
    "it is well known that , at large @xmath0 , the dominant mechanism of light - quarkonium production is via the fragmentation of gluons and quarks , while the parton - fusion process is suppressed by powers @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mass of the quarks bound in the quarkonium state .",
    "so , the fusion process , which is a higher - twist contribution , can contribute significantly only at extremely small @xmath0 , which for the light quarkonia is in the soft region outside the perturbative regime . for @xmath1 production , this region , due to the larger charm - quark mass @xmath13",
    ", extends to larger @xmath0 . but eventually , at @xmath14 , the fragmentation process ,",
    "although of higher order in @xmath15 compared to the fusion process , can exceed the fusion process .",
    "in fact , it was pointed out by braaten and yuan @xcite that , in addition to the parton - fusion contributions described by the csm , fragmentation of gluons and charm quarks is an important source for large-@xmath0 mesons in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "@xmath1 production in high - energy @xmath16 collisions at hera is dominated by photoproduction , where the electron is scattered by a small angle producing photons of almost zero virtuality .",
    "first experimental results in the kinematical region 30  gev@xmath17  gev , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy , have been presented by the h1 collaboration @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the inelastic process is analysed for the first time .",
    "most of the events come from the elastic and diffractive processes . they can be separated by measuring the @xmath1 energy spectrum in terms of the inelasticity variable @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 being the four - momenta of the proton , the photon , and the @xmath1 meson , respectively . for elastic / diffractive events ,",
    "one has @xmath24",
    ". a clean sample of inelastic events can be obtained by selecting events with @xmath25 . due to the limited integrated luminosity in the 1994 hera operation , the inelastic @xmath1 production cross section @xmath26",
    "could only be measured for @xmath27  gev@xmath28 @xcite . in this range of @xmath29 , the inelastic production proceeds predominantly through the fusion mechanism in the csm .",
    "in fact , the experimental @xmath0 and @xmath30 distributions are very well described , as for both shape and absolute normalization , by the csm next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculation of krmer @xcite , using up - to - date nlo parton density functions ( pdf s ) of the proton .",
    "as is well known , high - energy photoproduction proceeds through two distinct mechanisms : direct photoproduction , where the photon couples directly to the quarks , and resolved photoproduction , where the photon interacts through one of its partonic components , quarks or gluons , via hard scattering with the partonic constituents of the proton . for @xmath1 photoproduction within the csm ,",
    "the resolved - photon process is @xmath31+g\\to j/\\psi+g.\\ ] ] this means that the gluon coming from the proton interacts with the gluon from the proton to create a @xmath32 colour - singlet @xmath3 pair , which subsequently fuses into a @xmath1 meson .",
    "this process has been analysed @xcite with the result that its contribution to the overall cross section in the csm is small everywhere , except in the very - low-@xmath30 region .",

    "their contribution to inelastic @xmath1 photoproduction has also been calculated @xcite and found to be non - negligible .",
    "in fact , it is comparable to the cross section of colour - singlet direct photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the distributions in the inelasticity variable @xmath30 are , however , quite different .",
    "the resolved - photon cross section ( colour - singlet plus colour - octet ) is dominant at small @xmath30 , whereas the direct - photon contribution is large towards @xmath37 .    for @xmath2 production ,",
    "the colour - octet channels are much more important . in the case of direct photoproduction , the production of colour - singlet @xmath2 states via @xmath38+g\\to\\chi_{cj}+g\\ ] ] is forbidden to leading order in @xmath15 , so that the colour - octet processes @xmath39+g,\\nonumber\\\\ \\gamma+q(\\bar q)&{\\hspace*{-2.5mm}}\\to{\\hspace*{-2.5mm}}&c\\bar c[\\,\\underline{8},{}^3\\!s_1]+q(\\bar q),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the colour - octet @xmath32 @xmath3 pair fuses into a physical @xmath2 particle , are the dominant ones .",
    "nevertheless , using the matrix elements obtained through fits to the tevatron data @xcite , the contribution of the channels ( [ cfo ] ) is still small compared to the dominant csm contribution to @xmath1 production @xcite .",
    "the cross sections for resolved photoproduction of @xmath2 mesons in the colour - octet channels have not yet been estimated .",
    "all these results refer to @xmath1 production at @xmath0 values of order @xmath13 , where we may expect the higher - twist contribution to be dominant . at sufficiently large @xmath0 , the fragmentation process is supposed to be the dominant mechanism of @xmath1 photoproduction .",
    "first estimates of the fragmentation contribution to @xmath1 photoproduction have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite for earlier work within the csm .",
    "these authors considered , at leading order ( lo ) , the fragmentation of charm quarks and gluons produced through the direct - photon processes @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "they did not take into account resolved photoproduction , which is certainly important , too . in the case of @xmath1 production in @xmath36 collisions at the tevatron , it is the analogous mechanism which makes the dominant contribution @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to study @xmath1 photoproduction at large @xmath0 including all direct- and resolved - photoproduction channels at nlo .",
    "we shall focus our attention on the production via fragmentation .",
    "we shall consider the fusion mechanism only for comparison ; for simplicity , we shall only include its dominant lo contribution , which arises from direct photoproduction in the csm .",
    "the superposition of the nlo cross sections for the fusion and fragmentation mechanisms is left to future work .",
    "the framework for our calculation of the nlo fragmentation cross section is similar to the one employed recently for the calculation of inclusive @xmath42 photoproduction @xcite . at large @xmath0",
    ", one may neglect the mass of the charm quark .",
    "the collinear singularities corresponding to the @xmath43 terms of the massive - charm scheme , which is used , for example , for predictions at @xmath44 , are then absorbed into the charm - quark pdf s and the fragmentation functions ( ff s ) in the same way as for the lighter @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 quarks .",
    "the ff s for the fragmentation of charm quarks and gluons into @xmath1 mesons must be known for this approach at the scale of production , which is usually taken to be @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the transverse mass of the @xmath1 meson with mass @xmath50 .",
    "these ff s can be computed at the starting scale @xmath51 in nonrelativistic qcd adopting as nonperturbative input the colour - singlet and colour - octet transition - matrix elements , which also enter the fusion approach . at larger scales",
    "@xmath52 , the large logarithms in @xmath53 are resummed using the usual altarelli - parisi evolution equations . at the starting scale ,",
    "only the fragmentation of gluons and charm quarks need to be included , while the light - quark contributions are negligible .",
    "the latter will be generated at higher scales via evolution .",
    "the outline of our work is as follows .",
    "in section  2 , we shall shortly describe the formalism for the perturbative ff s and discuss the transition from massless to massive factorization used also in our previous work @xcite . in section  3 , we shall present our nlo predictions for the various fragmentation contributions to the cross section of @xmath1 photoproduction in @xmath16 collisions at hera as functions of @xmath0 and rapidity @xmath54 , and compare them with the lo csm results based on the @xmath3 fusion mechanism . specifically",
    ", we shall distinguish between direct - photon and resolved - photon , prompt and non - prompt ( only via @xmath2 states ) , colour - singlet and colour - octet fragmentation production .",
    "our conclusions will be summarized in section  4 .",
    "in this section , we shall describe the assumptions underlying the massless approach , which is very similar to that in our work on inclusive @xmath55 production @xcite . for the reader s convenience , we shall repeat here the basic ideas developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as already mentioned in the introduction , two mechanism",
    "contribute to the photoproduction of charm quarks in @xmath16 collisions : @xmath56 in the direct photoproduction mechanism , the photon couples directly to the quarks , which besides the massless @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 quarks , also include the massless charm quark . in this case , at least in the lo processes , no spectator particles travel along the momentum direction of the photon .",
    "@xmath57 in the resolved photoproduction mechanism , the photon splits up into fluxes of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath58 quarks and gluons , which then interact with the partons coming from the proton leading to the production of quarks , including charm quarks , and gluons at large @xmath0 .",
    "the contributing parton - level processes are the same as in the case of @xmath1 production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the quarks and gluons coming out of the photon are accompanied by a spectator jet , which also travels in the photon direction .",
    "therefore , the @xmath19 cross section depends not only on the pdf s of the proton but also on those of the photon .",
    "the main difference with respect to the usually considered massive - charm scheme , which to our knowledge has not yet been worked out for @xmath1 production via fragmentation , is that the charm quark also contributes via the pdf s of the proton and the photon , _",
    "i.e. _ , charm is already an active flavour in the initial state .",
    "compared to @xmath42 production , where the @xmath42 mesons are almost exclusively produced via charm - quark fragmentation , in @xmath1 production the fragmentation process @xmath59 is very important as well , as we shall see in the next section .",
    "the massless - charm approach is justified if a large scale is governing the production process . in our case , this is the transverse momentum of the @xmath1 meson , with @xmath60 . in this region , non - singular mass terms are suppressed in the cross section by powers of @xmath61 .",
    "the important mass terms appear if the virtuality of the charm quark is small .",
    "this occurs in the initial state if the charm quark is emitted from the proton or photon , and in the final state if the partons emit a @xmath3 pair .",
    "these two contributions lead to the @xmath43 terms in the massive scheme . in our massless approach , they are summed into the scale - dependent proton and photon pdf s and @xmath1 ff s .    to obtain the final @xmath1 production cross sections in nlo ,",
    "the following steps are taken .",
    "@xmath56 the nlo hard - scattering cross sections for the direct- and resolved - photon processes are calculated in the massless approximation with @xmath62 active flavours @xcite .",
    "the collinear singularities are subtracted according to the @xmath63 scheme . since the charm quark is taken to be massless , the singularities from its splittings are subtracted as well .",
    "@xmath57 the charm quark is accommodated in the pdf s of the proton and photon as a light flavour .",
    "the finite mass of the charm quark is taken into account by including it in the evolution of the pdf s in such a way that these are only non - vanishing above a scale set by its mass . @xmath64",
    "the ff s characterize the hadronization of the massless partons , including the charm quark , into @xmath3 bound states , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons . similarly to the fragmentation into light mesons , these ff s are non - perturbative input and must be determined by experiment , for example from the cross section of inclusive @xmath1 and @xmath2 production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "this information determines the ff s at some starting scale , @xmath65 .",
    "an alternative methods is to calculate , within perturbative qcd , universal starting conditions for the ff s at a scale @xmath65 of order @xmath66 .",
    "this allows one to include in a straightforward manner the colour - octet contributions with parameters related to the ones obtained from the analysis of colour - octet fusion .",
    "the structure of the perturbative ff s is based on the general factorization analysis of the production and decay of heavy quarkonia by bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite .",
    "this factorization formalism allows for the ff s of charmonium production to be factorized into short - distance coefficients that describe the production rate of a @xmath3 pair within a region of size @xmath67 , and long - distance factors that contain the non - perturbative dynamics responsible for the formation of the bound state @xmath68 containing the @xmath3 pair .",
    "the ff , at factorization scale @xmath69 , for a parton @xmath70 to fragment into the charmonium state @xmath68 with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath71 can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 labels different colour components ( singlet or octet ) and spin quantum numbers to be specified later .",

    "both in the direct- and resolved - photon channels , the fragmentation cross sections fall off less steeply with @xmath0 than the fusion cross section . in all cases , we observe that the prompt colour - octet contribution is most significant and dominates the large-@xmath0 behaviour .",

    "we emphasize that , in the low-@xmath0 range , the resolved - photon component , which was previously neglected @xcite , is considerably more important than the direct - photon component , by a factor of 18 ( 2.3 ) at @xmath165  gev ( 10  gev ) .",
    "the two components cross over at @xmath167  gev .",
    "notice also that , even for @xmath168  gev , the resolved - photon component is comparable to the fusion contribution ; for @xmath169  gev , it exceeds the fusion contribution . in the resolved - photon contribution , the prompt colour - singlet part is negligibly small compared to the prompt colour - octet part .",
    "this is caused by the dominance of @xmath59 in the resolved - photon cross section and the suppression of colour - singlet gluon fragmentation mentioned above . in the direct - photon cross section , this hierarchy is reduced since @xmath170 is more important .    in general , rapidity distributions allow for a more specific investigation of the individual contributions than transverse - momentum distributions . in figs .",

    "as might be inferred from figs .",
    "[ fig1](a)(c ) , the prompt colour - octet contribution is dominant ; in fact , this is true over the full @xmath145 range .",
    "we observe that the @xmath145 spectra of the prompt colour - singlet channel , although suppressed , have a shape similar to the fusion contribution and are peaked at significantly smaller @xmath145 values than the other fragmentation channels . at large @xmath0 , the dominant @xmath1 production mechanism in @xmath36 collisions at the tevatron is colour - octet gluon fragmentation @xcite . in order for hera experiments to probe this component , it will be necessary to take data in the very forward direction , where the resolved - photon colour - octet contribution is most significant .",
    "it should be clear that the colour - octet contributions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a)(c ) are proportional to the corresponding matrix elements specified in section  2 , which are extracted from fits to tevatron data .",
    "so , in order to substantiate ( or question ) the huge prompt colour - octet @xmath1 contribution that is apparently indispensable to reconcile the tevatron data with theory , it would be desirable to collect data in the very forward region at hera , which has not yet been explored by the h1 and zeus collaborations .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the present analysis extends the previous work @xcite on @xmath1 fragmentation production at hera in two important respects .",
    "for one thing , we include the resolved - photon contribution , which was not mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we work at nlo , while the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite proceeds at lo . above",
    ", we have stressed the significance of the resolved - photon contribution , which is nicely illustrated in figs .",

    "[ fig3](a)(c ) . in the case of direct photoproduction considered in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the prompt colour - singlet contribution has an approximately constant @xmath162 factor of about 0.6 , while the prompt colour - octet and non - prompt contributions have diminishing @xmath162 factors only at @xmath0 values below 6.5 and 4 , respectively . in the case of resolved photoproduction addressed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , the @xmath162 factors of the various channels are always significantly larger than unity , and the overall @xmath162 factor ranges between 2 and 2.4 . in both the direct- and resolved - photon cases ,",
    "the @xmath162 factors of the non - prompt contributions take extraordinarily large values in the upper @xmath0 range .",
    "detailed investigation reveals that this enhancement essentially originates from the lower edge of the kinematically allowed @xmath145 range .",
    "however , since , at large @xmath0 , these contributions are greatly suppressed relative to the prompt colour - octet contributions , this is inconsequential for the superposition of all channels , which is experimentally observable .",
    "in fact , the overall @xmath162 factor , which is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) , is well behaved , ranging between 1.6 and 1.8 in the @xmath0 range considered .    at this point , we should comment on the lo analysis of direct @xmath1 photoproduction via fragmentation at hera reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the present study , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite included the prompt , non - prompt , colour - singlet , and colour - octet contributions .",
    "however , they did not convolute the @xmath19 cross section with the weizscker - williams distribution , but considered fixed photon energies instead .",
    "there is an overall factor of 18 missing on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 3 ) in ref .  @xcite , which is to describe the fusion cross section . in the case of fragmentation production , a meaningful quantitative comparison is impossible , since the input values of the poorly known colour - octet matrix elements are not to be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one should bear in mind that all results presented in this subsection refer to the low-@xmath18 range 30  gev@xmath138  gev .",
    "we expect that the resolved - photon contribution will be enhanced relative to the fusion contribution if @xmath18 is increased . in the next subsection , this issue will be addressed in some detail .      in order to test the predictions for @xmath1 photoproduction via fragmentation at hera that follow from the theoretical analysis of the tevatron data , it is useful to find regions of phase space where the fusion mechanism is suppressed . as we have seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a)(c ) , this happens , for instance , in the very forward region of the detector .",
    "but even in the central region , @xmath164 , to which previous measurements of charmed - meson photoproduction at hera were confined @xcite , fragmentation production may be enhanced with respect to the fusion mechanism by selecting events with high photon energy .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath173 is shown for @xmath171 and 10  gev . while the @xmath18 distribution of the direct - photon contribution has a shape similar to that of the fusion contribution , with a maximum at low to intermediate @xmath18 , the resolved - photon contribution tends to be monotonically increasing with increasing @xmath18 . as a consequence , even at low @xmath0 ,",
    "fragmentation production becomes more important than the fusion mechanism beyond some point in @xmath18 . at @xmath171",
    ", the cross - over takes place at about @xmath174  gev , which corresponds to @xmath175 in eq .",
    "( [ wwa ] ) .    guided by this observation , we repeat the analysis of fig .  [ fig1](c ) integrating over 150  gev @xmath140  gev , instead of 30  gev@xmath138  gev , and plot the outcome in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . as expected , this leads to a significant increase of the fragmentation contribution , which mainly originates from the resolved - photon part . on the other hand ,",
    "the fusion contribution is only moderately increased at @xmath176  gev , while it is even decreased at lower values of @xmath0 . in conclusion , over the entire @xmath0 range , the fragmentation contribution is now more than twice as large as the fusion contribution ; at @xmath177  gev , the fusion contribution falls short of the fragmentation contribution by more than one order of magnitude .    at hera",
    ", it should also be possible to detect @xmath1 mesons in the very forward direction , almost up to @xmath178 @xcite . this would offer the opportunity to render the fragmentation to fusion ratio even more favourable .",
    "thus , in fig .  [ fig6 ] , we investigate how the results for 150  gev@xmath140  gev in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] are modified if the @xmath145 interval is shifted from @xmath164 to @xmath179 .",
    "we observe that the fragmentation contribution is then enhanced , almost by a factor of two at large @xmath0 .",
    "but , what is even more significant , the fusion contribution is reduced by one to two orders of magnitude . as a consequence , the fragmentation to fusion ratio",
    "is dramatically increased , to values in excess of 200 throughout the entire @xmath0 range .",
    "we conclude , that the kinematical region of large @xmath18 and large @xmath145 is an ideal place to probe at hera the anomalously large inclusive @xmath1 yield observed at the tevatron .",
    "it has become customary to present experimental data on inclusive @xmath1 production in terms of the inelasticity variable @xmath30 defined in the introduction , instead of using @xmath145 .",
    "the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath145 reads @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the proton energy in the laboratory system .",
    "thus , the kinematical range of interest corresponds to small values of @xmath30 .",
    "this is in line with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the kinematical cut @xmath182 has been proposed to enhance the fragmentation contribution relative to the fusion contribution .",
    "we have recently assessed , in a nlo analysis @xcite , the logistics of enhancing via appropriate acceptance cuts the colour - octet contribution to @xmath1 production via fragmentation at hera .",
    "in addition to the well - known parton - fusion mechanism , @xmath1 mesons may also be produced via the fragmentation of final - state partons .",
    "the latter mechanism is expected to be the dominant source of @xmath1 mesons at sufficiently large @xmath0 . in this paper , we studied the photoproduction of @xmath1 mesons at large @xmath0 via fragmentation at hera .",
    "our calculation was performed at nlo in the qcd - improved parton model with @xmath62 massless quark flavours , _",
    "i.e. _ , the charm quark was assumed to be an active flavour inside the proton and the resolved photon .",
    "we employed charm and gluon ff s which were perturbatively calculated at a fragmentation scale of order @xmath66 in nonrelativistic qcd , and evolved them in @xmath71 space to the characteristic scale of the considered process , of order @xmath0 , using nlo altarelli - parisi splitting functions . at the same time , we adjusted the factorization scheme of the collinear singularities connected with final - state charm quarks so as to match the corresponding calculation with massive charm quarks . in this way",
    ", large logarithms of the type @xmath183 , which would be present in the massive calculation and render it unreliable at large @xmath0 , are removed from the hard - scattering cross sections and properly resummed .",
    "we included prompt @xmath1 fragmentation production as well as @xmath2 fragmentation production followed by @xmath139 decays ( non - prompt @xmath1 fragmentation production ) . in each channel",
    ", we took into account the contributions due to colour - singlet and colour - octet @xmath3 states .",
    "apart from direct photoproduction , which had been considered to lo in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also studied resolved photoproduction , both at nlo .",
    "while the nonperturbative matrix elements multiplying the colour - singlet ff s may be reliably extracted from the decay properties of the charmonium states , the colour - octet matrix elements are adjusted to account for the enormous excess of recent tevatron data on large-@xmath0 charmonium production over the theoretical prediction within the csm .",
    "this procedure implicitly assumes , on the theoretical side , that there are no other production mechanisms that have been overlooked so far and , on the experimental side , that all backgrounds are fully under control .",
    "therefore , the colour - octet matrix elements must be considered far less rigorously determined than the colour - singlet matrix elements .",
    "obviously , it is of prime importance to probe the colour - octet matrix elements in other experiments as well .",
    "the signature for colour - octet @xmath1 production in @xmath184 annihilation at the @xmath185-boson resonance has recently been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , we continued this research programme by assessing the prospects of the hera experiments to substantiate the findings at the tevatron .",
    "our main observations may be summarized as follows . as for direct @xmath1 photoproduction ,",

    "[ fig1](b ) and [ fig2](b ) ] , by a factor of 18 ( 2.3 ) at @xmath165  gev ( 10  gev ) . in fact , the resolved - photon fragmentation cross section already exceeds the fusion cross section at @xmath188  gev and is comparable to it at smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "the bulk of this cross section originates in the subprocesses @xmath189 and @xmath190 followed by the fragmentation chain @xmath191\\to j/\\psi$ ] .",
    "the dominance of resolved photoproduction is partly due to a large qcd @xmath162 factor , in excess of 2 [ see fig .  [ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "these results refer to the standard ranges @xmath164 and 30  gev@xmath17  gev .",
    "we suggested two ways to further enhance the ( resolved - photon ) fragmentation production relative to the fusion mechanism .",
    "one is to concentrate on the forward direction , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath179 , where the resolved - photoproduction cross section peaks [ see fig .  [ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the other one is to increase the cm energy available for the hard @xmath19 scattering , _",
