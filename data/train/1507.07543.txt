    "achieving high directivity with compact radiators has been a major concern of the antenna community since its early days @xcite .",
    "still today , many modern applications , such as automotive radars , satellite communication , millimetre - wave point - to - point communication , and microwave imaging , strive for simple and efficient low - profile antennas producing the narrowest possible beams @xcite . extending the size of the radiating aperture leads to an enhanced directivity , but only if the aperture is efficiently excited .",
    "to date , uniform illumination of large apertures is achievable with reflectors and lenses ; although these can be made compact using concurrent metamaterial concepts , they still require substantial separation between the source and the aperture , resulting in a large overall antenna size @xcite .",
    "in addition , feed blockage and spillover effects must also be considered , usually complicating the design and reducing the device efficiency .",
    "high aperture efficiencies can also be achieved using antenna arrays @xcite ; nevertheless , the requirement for elaborated feed network significantly increases the complexity of this solution and limits its compactness @xcite , and may also introduce considerable feed - network losses .",
    "leaky - wave antennas ( lwas ) , on the other hand , can produce directive beams using a low - profile structure fed by a simple single source @xcite .",
    "their typical configuration consists of a guiding structure with a small perturbation , facilitating coupling of guided modes to free - space radiation . in the much - discussed fabry - prot ( fp )",
    "lwas , a localized source is sandwiched between a perfect electric conductor ( pec ) and a partially - reflecting surface ( prs ) , forming a longitudinal fp cavity @xcite . by tuning the cavity height at the design frequency @xmath0 , favourable coupling of the source to a single parallel - plate waveguide mode",
    "is achieved , forming a dominant leaky wave emanating from the source ; the typical device thickness lies around half of a wavelength .",
    "the leaky mode is characterized by a transverse wavenumber whose real part @xmath1 corresponds to the waveguide dispersion , and is accompanied by a small imaginary part @xmath2 determined by the prs .",
    "this leads to an azimuthally - symmetric directive radiation through the prs towards the direction defined by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the free - space wavenumber , with a beamwidth proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "broadside radiation is achieved when @xmath5 is small enough such that the splitting condition @xmath6 is satisfied , and the peaks of the conical beam merge @xcite .",
    "another class of lwas which has received significant attention lately is based on modulated impedance metasurfaces ( mometas ) @xcite .",
    "these so - called holographic antennas use a point source to excite surface waves on a thin dielectric sheet covered with metallic patches and backed by a pec ground plane , establishing effective surface impedance boundary conditions @xcite ; guiding surface waves , these structures can be very thin , below fifth of a wavelength .",
    "similar to fp - lwas , the guiding structure is designed such that only a single surface mode @xmath7 is allowed to propagate ; small modulation of the surface impedance , implemented by variation of patch sizes or dielectric thickness , couples the bound modes to radiative modes . to facilitate such coupling in the case of surface waves ,",
    "whose transverse momentum is greater than that of free - space , the impedance modulation should have a periodicity @xmath8 comparable to the wavelength . the interaction between the surface wave and the perturbation results in an infinite number of floquet - bloch ( fb ) harmonics @xmath9 ; the periodicity should be designed such that one of them radiates to the desirable direction , while the others become evanescent , ensuring good directivity .",
    "the leakage rate @xmath2 , and correspondingly the beamwidth , are determined by the depth of the modulation @xcite .",
    "both fp - lwas and mometas have an appealing compact configuration and their radiation characteristics can be rather simply controlled by tuning the properties of the guiding structure and the perturbation . nonetheless , due to their leaky - wave nature , they suffer from a fundamental efficiency limitation when considering practical finite apertures : designing a moderate leakage rate @xmath2 with respect to the aperture length @xmath10 yields uniform illumination of the aperture ( high aperture efficiency ) but results in considerable losses from the edges ( low radiation efficiency ) ; on the other hand , large values of @xmath2 lead to high radiation efficiencies but in this case only a portion of the aperture is used for radiation , leading to a wider beam @xcite .    to mitigate edge - taper losses , shielded fp - lwa structures have been recently proposed , using pec side walls which form a lateral cavity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the tight coupling between the propagation of the leaky mode inside the fp cavity and the angular distribution of the radiated power manifested by @xmath3 poses serious limitations on the achievable aperture efficiency .",
    "this is most prominent for antennas radiating at broadside , in which only low - order lateral modes , carrying transverse wavenumbers which are small enough to satisfy the splitting condition , can be used .",
    "consequently , such antennas are designed to excite exclusively the @xmath11 lateral mode , which inherently limits the aperture efficiency , defined as the relative directivity with respect to the case of uniform illumination , to about @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "although this problem can be partially solved by the use of artificial magnetic conductor ( amc ) side walls instead of pecs @xcite , one of the most limiting constraints on the antenna design which still remains is the requirement for mode purity . as the dominant spectral components of the field in the cavity directly translate to prominent lobes in the radiation pattern , only a single mode should be allowed to propagate in the cavity to guarantee high directivity . however , as demonstrated by @xcite , suppression of parasitic modes in a cavity is usually a very difficult problem .",
    "in particular , single mode excitation becomes increasingly challenging as the desirable aperture size increases , due to the small differences between the wavenumbers associated with low - order modes ; thus , in practice , this solution can not be used for arbitrarily - large apertures . from the discussion",
    "so far it follows that it would be very beneficial if we could optimize separately the fields inside the cavity and the fields formed on the aperture .",
    "this would allow us to achieve good illumination of the aperture without the necessity to meet restricting conditions ( e.g. , the splitting condition , or single mode excitation ) , stemming from the coupling between excitation and radiation fields . but how to achieve such a separation ?",
    "the equivalence principle suggests that for a given field exciting a surface , desirable ( arbitrary ) aperture fields can be formed by inducing suitable electric and magnetic surface currents , supporting the required field discontinuities @xcite .",
    "based on this idea , the concept of huygens metasurfaces ( hmss ) has been recently proposed as a means for versatile wavefront manipulation @xcite .",
    "huygens metasurfaces are planar structures composed of subwavelength elements ( meta - atoms ) , engineered to generate the surface currents required by the equivalence principle to achieve a prescribed functionality . in general , for a given incident field and desirable transmitted field , elements exhibiting effective loss and gain are required for the implementation @xcite .",
    "however , for certain applications , the fields can be judiciously stipulated such that the metasurface can be constructed from passive and lossless elements , i.e. electric and magnetic polarizable particles @xcite . in fact , we have recently shown that if the reflected and transmitted fields are set such that the wave impedance and the real power are continuous across the two facets of the metasurface , the aperture phase can be tailored by a passive and lossless hms to produce directive radiation towards a prescribed angle @xmath5 , for any given excitation source ; the design procedure is straightforward once the source plane - wave spectrum is assessed @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this paper we propose to harness the equivalence principle to efficiently convert fields excited in a cavity by a localized source to highly - directive radiation using a huygens metasurface : cavity - excited hms antenna .",
    "the device structure resembles a typical shielded fp - lwa configuration , with an electric line source surrounded by three pec walls and a huygens metasurface replacing the standard prs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : physical_configuration ] ) . for a given aperture length @xmath10 and a desirable transmission angle @xmath5 ,",
    "we optimize the fp cavity thickness and source position to predominantly excite the highest - order mode of the lateral cavity , with the hms reflection coefficient ensuring the wave impedance is equalized along the metasurface ; this guarantees the aperture is well illuminated .",
    "once the source configuration is established , we stipulate the aperture fields to follow the power profile of the cavity mode , ensuring the real power is conserved at each point , and impose the suitable linear phase to promote radiation towards @xmath5 . with the cavity fields and aperture fields in hand , we invoke the equivalence principle and evaluate the electric surface impedance and magnetic surface admittance required to support the resultant field discontinuity @xcite .",
    "our previous work @xcite guarantees that these would be purely reactive , hence could be implemented using passive and lossless meta - atoms .        utilizing the equivalence principle as described results in formation of aperture fields , the magnitude of which follows the power distribution inside the cavity , whereas their phase is independently determined to vary in a plane - wave - like fashion .",
    "this has two important implications .",
    "first , as the power profile of the highest - order lateral mode creates hot spots of radiating surface currents approximately half a wavelength apart , a uniform virtual phased - array is formed on the hms aperture ; based on array theory @xcite , such excitation profile is expected to yield very high directivity with no grating lobes regardless of the scan angle @xmath5 .",
    "second , in contrast to lwas of any type , the antenna directivity does not deteriorate significantly even if other modes are partially excited , as these would merely vary the amplitude of the virtual array elements , without affecting the phase purity .",
    "this semianalytical design procedure can be applied to arbitrarily - large apertures , yielding near - unity aperture efficiencies , in agreement with full - wave simulations ; due to the pec side walls , no power is lost via the edges .",
    "this offers an effective way to overcome the efficiency tradeoff inherent to fp - lwas and mometas , while preserving the advantages of a single - feed low - profile antenna .",
    "to design the hms - based antenna , we simply apply the general methodology developed in @xcite to the source configuration of fig . [",
    "fig : physical_configuration ] ; for completeness , we recall briefly its main steps .",
    "we consider a 2d scenario ( @xmath13 ) with the hms at @xmath14 and a given excitation geometry at @xmath15 embedded in a homogeneous medium ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . under these circumstances ,",
    "the incident , reflected and transmitted fields in the vicinity of the hms can be expressed via their plane - wave spectrum @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the inverse spatial fourier transform of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the source spectrum , @xmath22 is the hms reflection coefficient , and @xmath23 $ ] is the transmission spectrum . as before , @xmath1 denotes the transverse wavenumber , and the longitudinal wavenumber is @xmath24 . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider here transverse electric ( te ) fields ( @xmath25 ) ; the nonvanishing magnetic field components @xmath26 can be calculated from @xmath27 via maxwell s equations .    for a given source spectrum",
    ", it is required to determine the reflected and transmitted fields , through the respective degrees of freedom @xmath22 and @xmath28 , that would implement the desirable functionality .",
    "once the tangential fields on the two facets of the hms are set , the equivalence principle is invoked to evaluate the required electric and magnetic surface currents to induce them @xcite .",
    "the polarizable particles comprising the hms are then designed such that the average fields acting on them induce these surface currents @xcite .",
    "analogously , the hms can be characterized by its electric surface impedance @xmath29 and magnetic surface admittance @xmath30 , relating the field discontinuity and the average excitation via the generalized sheet transition conditions ( gstcs ) @xcite ,    to promote directive radiation towards @xmath5 we require that the aperture ( transmitted ) fields approximately follow the suitable plane - wave - like relation@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the aperture window ( envelope ) function ( yet to be determined ) and @xmath33 is the te wave impedance of a plane - wave directed towards @xmath5 .    in previous work , we have shown that if the wave impedance and the real power are continuous across the metasurface , these aperture fields can be supported by a passive lossless hms ( purely reactive @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "the first condition , local impedance equalization , means that the total ( incident+reflected ) fields on the bottom facet of the metasurface should exhibit the same wave impedance , i.e. @xmath36 ; this is achieved by setting the reflection coefficient to a fresnel - like form @xmath37 determining the reflected fields everywhere , fixing our first degree of freedom . to satisfy the second condition , local power conservation , we require that the aperture window function follows the _ magnitude _ of the total ( incident+reflected ) fields at @xmath38 , namely , @xmath39f\\left(k_t\\right)\\right\\rbrace\\right| \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\left(\\mathcal{f}^{-1}\\left\\lbrace \\textstyle \\left[\\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)f\\right]\\star\\left[\\frac{1}{2\\beta}\\left(1-\\gamma\\right)f\\right]\\right\\rbrace\\right)^{1/2 } ,   % \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\left|\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{dk_t}{2\\beta } %    \\left[1-\\gamma\\left(k_t\\right)\\right]f\\left(k_t\\right)e^{jk_ty}\\right|e^{-j\\xi_\\mathrm{out } } , \\nonumber \\label{equ : aperture_window_function}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the autocorrelation of the spectral - domain function @xmath41 @xcite ; this determines the transmitted fields everywhere , fixing our second degree of freedom .",
    "the absolute value operator in the last equality is of utmost significance : it indicates that the transmission spectrum of the aperture fields follows , up to a square root , the _ power spectral density _",
    "( psd ) of @xmath42 , and _ not _ the spectral content of the incident and reflected _",
    "is directly related to the balanced ( plane - wave - like ) contribution of the electric and magnetic fields to the power flow that we stipulated in eq . , and results in a significantly favourable plane - wave spectrum , as will be discussed in detail in the next subsection .",
    "finally , we use these semianalytically predicted fields and the equivalence principle , manifested by the gstcs , to calculate the required hms surface impedance , yielding the desirable purely reactive modulation given by , @xmath43\\right\\rbrace \\frac{z_{se}\\left(y\\right)}{z_\\mathrm{out}}=\\frac{y_{sm}\\left(y\\right)}{y_\\mathrm{out}}=-\\frac{j}{2}\\cot\\left[\\frac{\\phi_{-}\\left(y\\right)-\\phi_{+}\\left(y\\right)}{2}\\right ] % \\nonumber \\label{equ : hms_design}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 are the phases of the stipulated fields just above and below the metasurface @xcite . once the general design procedure is established , applying it to the configuration of fig .",
    "[ fig : physical_configuration ] , which includes an electric line source at @xmath45 surrounded by pec walls at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , is straightforward : it reduces to finding the corresponding source spectrum .",
    "the latter is quantized due to the lateral cavity , and includes multiple reflections between the hms at @xmath14 and the pec at @xmath46 @xcite ; explicitly , @xmath48 \\delta\\left(k_t-\\frac{n\\pi}{l}\\right ) \\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "\\label{equ : cavity_source_spectrum}\\ ] ] we refer to the sum of the fields corresponding to the @xmath49 terms in the summation as the field of the @xmath50th mode of the lateral cavity , where @xmath51 .",
    "although this procedure is applicable for any transmission angle , we restrict ourselves from now on to the case of broadside radiation @xmath52 , where the performance of shielded and unshielded fp - lwas is the most problematic due to the splitting condition @xcite ( design of oblique - angle radiators is addressed in appendix [ sec : oblique_angle ] ) . in this case , the desirable radiation pattern is symmetric with respect to the @xmath53 plane , thus it is only natural to use a laterally - symmetric excitation ; subsequently , we set the lateral position of the source to be @xmath54 throughout the rest of the paper . with this selection , the even modes vanish , and the odd modes follow a cosine profile in the lateral dimension .",
    "one of the key differences between the cavity - excited hms antenna and fp - lwas is that by harnessing the equivalence principle we control the _ individual _ contributions of the electric and magnetic fields to the flow of power , expressed by the lateral distribution of the @xmath55-component of the poynting vector on the aperture .",
    "more specifically , as mentioned in the previous subsection , the resultant ( transmitted ) aperture fields corresponding to eq . actually follow the square root of the _ power _ profile dictated by the cavity mode , and _ not _ the profile of the cavity _ fields_.",
    "this distinction is very important , as the _ power _ profile of a standing wave is always positive , whereas the _ field _ profile changes signs along the lateral dimensions .",
    "hence , the spectral content of the aperture fields , which determines the far - field radiation pattern , is fundamentally different .    to illustrate this point , and to elucidate the guidelines for optimizing the cavity excitation",
    ", we compare the fields formed on the device aperture for a shielded fp - lwa , where a standard prs is used , and for a cavity - excited hms antenna with the same excitation .",

    "all plots are normalized to their maximum , as the radiation pattern is sensitive to the variation of the fields , and not to their magnitude .        as follows from eq . , the spatial profile of the @xmath50th - mode aperture field is proportional to @xmath60 for a standard prs , but for an hms designed according to eq .",

    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](b),(e ) ] . for the @xmath50th mode",
    ", the transmission spectrum of the hms aperture corresponds to the autocorrelation of the prs aperture spectrum , leading to formation of peaks centered around the second harmonics ( @xmath62 ) and dc ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "as both the right - propagating and left - propagating components of the standing wave coherently contribute to the dc peak , the latter dominates the transmission spectrum , and the radiation patterns corresponding to the hms aperture exhibit highly - directive radiation towards broadside [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](f ) ] .",
    "in contrast , the prs aperture devices exhibit symmetric ( conical ) radiation to angles determined by the dominant spectral components of the aperture fields @xcite , i.e. towards @xmath64 $ ] [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](c ) ] .",
    "the transverse wavenumber @xmath65 corresponding to the lowest - order mode @xmath56 is small enough such that the two symmetric beams merge @xcite , which enables the prs aperture to radiate a single beam at broadside .",
    "indeed , small - aperture shielded fp - lwas utilize this @xmath66 mode to generate broadside radiation .",
    "however , as demonstrated by @xcite , the aperture efficiency of this mode is inherently limited to about @xmath12 , due to the non - optimal cosine - shaped aperture illumination of the lowest - order mode @xcite , leading to broadening of the main beam [ inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](f ) ] .",
    "this highlights a key benefit of using an hms - based antenna , as it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](f ) that we can use high - order mode excitations , which provide a more uniform illumination of the aperture , for generating narrow broadside beams with enhanced directivities .    in fact , as the index @xmath50 of the mode exciting the hms increases , the autocorrelation of eq . drives the second harmonic peaks outside the visible region of the spectrum [ shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](b),(e ) ] , funnelling all the radiated power to the broadside beam , subsequently increasing the overall directivity .",
    "this improvement in radiation properties can be explained using ordinary array theory . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](d ) , the peaks of the field profile generated by the @xmath50th mode on the hms aperture form hot spots of radiating currents separated by a distance of @xmath67 .",
    "the radiation from such an aperture profile would resemble the one of a uniform array with the same element separation .",
    "as known from established array theory , to avoid grating lobes the element separation should be smaller than a wavelength @xcite . for an aperture length of @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is an integer , the hot spot separation satisfies this condition for mode indices @xmath70 ; specifically , for @xmath71 ( fig . [ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms ] ) , grating lobes would not be present in the radiation pattern for mode indices @xmath72 . in agreement with this argument , fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](f ) shows that for @xmath57 grating lobes still exist , while for the highest - order mode @xmath58 they indeed vanish .",

    "single _ mode as a function of the mode index @xmath50 .",
    "solid lines denote the respective radiation characteristics of a uniformly excited aperture @xcite and dash - dotted lines mark the hpbw ( blue ) and directivity ( red ) of _ multimode _ excitation corresponding to the hms antenna of fig .",
    "[ fig : physical_configuration ] with @xmath59 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74.,width=264 ]    these observations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_performance ] , where the radiation characteristics of an hms aperture of @xmath59 excited by a single mode are plotted as a function of the mode index @xmath50 ( only fast modes @xmath75 are considered ) . for comparison ,",
    "solid lines denoting the half - power beamwidth ( hpbw ) and directivity values achieved for a uniformly - illuminated aperture of the same size are presented as well .",
    "indeed , it can be seen that the lowest - order lateral mode exhibits the worst performance by far , and the performance improves as the mode index increases .",
    "while the half - power beamwidth saturates quickly , the directivity values continue to increase with @xmath50 until the point in which grating lobes disappear @xmath76 is crossed ; for mode indices @xmath72 the radiation characteristics of the hms aperture are comparable with those of the optimal uniformly - excited aperture .    from an array theory point of view ,",
    "excitation of the highest - order mode is preferable , as the corresponding equivalent element separation approaches @xmath77 , implying that such aperture profile would be suitable for directing the radiation to large oblique angles @xmath78 without generating grating lobes @xcite .",
    "another reason to prefer excitation of the highest - order mode in the case of cavity - excited hms antennas is that the hms reflection coefficient @xmath22 grows larger with @xmath79 ; therefore , the power carried by the highest - order mode @xmath80 is best - trapped in the cavity , guaranteeing uniform illumination even in the case of very large apertures .",
    "nevertheless , generating a single - mode excitation of a cavity via a localized source can be very problematic @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the cavity - excited hms antenna can function very well also with multimode excitation , as long as high - order modes dominate the transmission spectrum .",
    "this is demonstrated by the dot - dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms ] and [ fig : mode_performance ] , corresponding to a multimode excitation generated by the configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : physical_configuration ] with @xmath59 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "as expected from the expression for the source spectrum [ eq . ] , for a given aperture length @xmath10 , the field just below the aperture due to a line source would be a superposition of lateral modes , the weights of which are determined by the particular source configuration , namely the cavity thickness @xmath81 and source position @xmath82 . the multimode transmission spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](b ) indicates that for the chosen parameter values , high - order modes ( @xmath83 ) predominantly populate the aperture spectrum , however low - order modes ( @xmath84 ) are present as well , to a non - negligible extent ( this takes into account the fact that the transmission coefficient @xmath85 is higher for lower - order modes ) .",
    "considering that the far - field angular power distribution @xmath86 is proportional to @xmath87 , the multimode excitation of the prs aperture results in a radiation pattern resembling the one corresponding to single mode excitation of the highest - order mode ( @xmath58 ) but with significant lobes around broadside [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](c ) ] ; consequently , even if a conical beam is desirable , multimode excitation would result in significant deterioration of the directivity .",
    "on the other hand , the same multimode excitation does not degrade substantially the performance of the hms antenna . the autocorrelated spectrum , relevant to the field induced on the hms aperture , results in merging of all spectral components into a sharp dc peak , with the high - order grating lobes pushed to the evanescent region of the spectrum [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](e ) ] .",
    "this retains a beamwidth comparable with that resulting from a single - mode excitation of the highest - order mode , with only slight deterioration of the directivity due to increased side - lobe level [ fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](f ) and inset ] . continuing the analogy to array theory ,",
    "such multimode excitation introduces slight variations to the magnitude of the array elements , forming an equivalent non - uniform array @xcite . the corresponding multimode hpbw and directivity values",
    "are marked , respectively , by blue and red dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_performance ] , verifying that indeed , cavity - excited hms antennas achieve near - unity aperture efficiencies with a practical multimode excitation ; this points out another key advantage of the cavity - excited hms antenna with respect to shielded fp - lwas .    with these observations in hand ,",
    "we are finally ready to formulate guidelines for optimizing the cavity excitation for maximal directivity . for a given aperture length @xmath68 , with respect to eq . , we maximize the coupling to the @xmath80 mode ( which exhibits the best directivity ) by tuning the cavity thickness @xmath81 as to minimize the denominator of the corresponding coupling coefficient ; equally important , we minimize the coupling to the @xmath56 mode ( which exhibits the worst directivity ) by tuning the source position @xmath82 as to minimize the numerator of the corresponding coupling coefficient . to achieve these with minimal device thickness we derive the following design rules @xmath88",
    "although this is somewhat analogous to the typical design rules for ( unshielded ) fp - lwas @xcite , the key difference is that for hms - based antennas we optimize the source configuration _",
    "regardless _ of the desirable transmission angle @xmath5 .",
    "this difference is directly related to the utilization of the equivalence principle for the design of the proposed device , which provides certain decoupling between its excitation and radiation spectrum [ _ cf . _",
    "[ fig : mode_analysis_prs_hms](b),(e ) ] .",
    "this decoupling becomes very apparent when the hms antenna is designed to radiate towards oblique angles @xmath89 , in which case the same cavity excitation yields optimal directivity as well ( see appendix [ sec : oblique_angle ] ) .",
    "two important comments are relevant when considering these design rules .",
    "first , even though following eq",
    ". maximizes the coupling coefficient of the highest - order mode and minimizes the coupling coefficient of the lowest - order mode , it does not prohibit coupling to other modes .",
    "the particular superposition of lateral modes exhibits a tradeoff between bemawidth and side - lobe level ( as for non - uniform arrays @xcite ) .",
    "thus , final optimization of the cavity illumination profile is achieved by fine - tuning the source position @xmath82 for the cavity thickness @xmath81 derived in eq . , with the aid of the efficient semianalytical formulas . in fact , the source position @xmath82 is another degree of freedom that can be used to optimize the radiation pattern for other desirable performance features , such as minimal side - lobe level ; this feature is further discussed and demonstrated in appendix [ sec : reduced_sll ] .",
    "second , although the optimal device thickness increases with increasing aperture length , the increase is sublinear , following an asymptotic square - root proportion factor .",
    "therefore , applying the proposed concept to very large apertures would still result in a relatively compact device , while efficiently utilizing the aperture for producing highly - directive pencil beams .",
    "we follow the design procedure and the considerations discussed in section [ sec : theory ] to design cavity - excited hms antennas for broadside radiation with different aperture lengths : @xmath59 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",

    "several assumptions made during the derivation of the hms design formulas contribute to discrepancies between predicted and actual performance of the presented antennas .",
    "first , the predicted fields are derived assuming the hms is capable of implementing continuous surface impedance boundary conditions , with unbound surface impedance values ; nevertheless , the physical implementation requires discretization of the continuous modulation into unit - cells , and the range of achievable surface impedance values is limited ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spider_cell_lookup_tables ] ) .",
    "second , the hms is assumed to be passive and lossless , however realistic conductors and dielectrics , used for the implementation of the devices in ansys hfss , include unavoidable losses .",
    "third , to facilitate the plane - wave - like relation between the transmitted fields on the aperture [ eq . ] , while still guaranteeing they obey maxwell s equations , we have used the approximation @xmath161 \\right\\ } \\right| \\label{equ : sve_1}\\ ] ] which is satisfied when @xmath162 which is a refinement of the slowly - varying envelope ( sve ) approximation utilized in @xcite .",
    "this approximation is self - consistent with our design scheme , as when the transmitted fields are directive towards @xmath163 as desirable , the dominant components of the transmission spectrum @xmath164 are in the vicinity of @xmath165 , where the reflection coefficient @xmath166 completely vanish ( the numerator of eq . vanishes ) .",
    "interestingly , the impacts of these three assumptions can be assessed by reviewing the predicted and simulated power flow across the metasurface .",
    "the @xmath55-directed power profiles below ( blue ) and above ( red ) the hms as predicted by the semaianalytical formalism ( open circles and squares , respectively ) and as extracted from full - wave simulations ( dashed and solid lines , respectively ) are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_profiles ] , for the three antennas reported in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "the fact that the general trend and quantitative data of the semianalytical and simulated results compare well ( note that the profiles are plotted using a common @xmath167 unit scale ) , indicates that the first assumption is valid ( this is also supported by @xcite ) .",
    "the semianalytical predictions made based on a homogenized continuous surface impedance boundary conditions mostly agree with the simulation data recorded below and above the metasurface , where effective medium theory predicts discretization effects to be negligible @xcite .",
    "violations of the second assumption , regarding the lossless nature of the hms , would manifest themselves as differences between the simulated power profile below and above the metasurface , which must originate in dissipation in the unit - cell conductors and dielectrics . on the other hand , violations of the third assumption , related to the sve approximation , would manifest themselves as differences in the semianalytically predicted power profile below and above the metasurface , as they correspond to violations of local power conservation @xcite .",
    "local deviations from these two assumptions are found to be rather small , they contribute to a non - negligible reduction of the total power flow across the metasurface ( integrated over the aperture length ) .",
    "the values denoted in the legends of fig .",
    "[ fig : power_profiles ] indicate that according to full - wave simulations about @xmath168 of the power below the hms is dissipated in the lossy conductors and dielectrics , while the semianalytically predictions reveal about @xmath159 discrepancy between the power below and above the metasurface .",
    "while these relative deviations can be considered small albeit non - negligible , it seems that they actually balance each other .",
    "the theoretical derivation assumes and prescribes a lossless hms , but the minor violations of the sve approximation contribute to predicted ( maxwellian ) fields which must be supported by small losses . on the other hand ,",
    "the implemented hms does include realistically unavoidable losses , which turn out to dissipate a comparable amount of power .",
    "we hypothesize that this balance allows overcoming the minor deviations from the theoretical assumptions , facilitating the very good agreement between predicted and simulated results reported herein .",
