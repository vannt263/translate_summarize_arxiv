    "one main focus of heavy - ion collision experiments is to understand the properties of the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "this phase transition is also important for various astrophysical reasons .",
    "for example , it plays a significant role in the dynamics of supernova explosions @xcite and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "there exist numerous studies on the liquid - gas phase - transition of both symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter using non - relativistic skyrme interactions @xcite as well as relativistic mean - field models @xcite .",
    "studies of the the liquid - gas mixed phase are mostly done using the gibbs phase equilibrium conditions derived in bulk limit i.e. ignoring the finite - size effects due to the surface and coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "several authors have included finite - size effects but at different levels of approximations and obtained considerable effects on the liquid - gas phase transition properties @xcite .",
    "recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite the influence of surface and coulomb interactions on the liquid - gas phase transition of stellar matter is studied in a consistent manner by using a compressible liquid - drop model where the surface and coulomb contributions are included while deriving the phase equilibrium conditions .",
    "they found that the finite - size effects significantly reduce the region of liquid - gas mixed phase and the critical temperature ( @xmath6 ) is much lower than that obtained with bulk calculation .    in this article , we investigate the influence of coulomb interaction on the liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter with quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) simulation .",
    "in particular , we use the qmd model developed by maruyama _",
    "et al _ @xcite and extensively used to study the various properties of pasta phases that appear at the liquid - gas transition region , in recent years @xcite .",
    "in the qmd approach the state of a nucleon is represented by a gaussian wave packet ( we set @xmath7 ) : @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the centers of the position and momentum of the wave packet @xmath11 , respectively , with the corresponding width @xmath12 .",
    "then the total wave function for the @xmath13-nucleon system is obtained by taking the direct product of single - nucleon wave functions @xmath14 here we adopt the qmd hamiltonian developed by maruyama _",
    "@xcite , to simulate the nuclear matter at sub - saturation densities .",
    "the hamiltonian consists of several terms : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kinetic energy , @xmath17 is the pauli potential , which phenomenologically incorporates the pauli exclusion principle , @xmath18 represents the nucleon - nucleon potential similar to skyrme - like interactions , @xmath19 is the isospin - dependent potential related to the symmetry energy , @xmath20 is the momentum - dependent potential included as fock terms of yukawa - type interactions and finally , @xmath21 is the coulomb potential .",

    "after determinating the phase transition line for all other densities we obtain the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_xp10 ] . > from the figure we can see that the phase transition temperatures for the two cases differ by @xmath33 mev at low densities ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "the critical point of the transition is located at @xmath35 mev , @xmath36 without the coulomb interaction and at @xmath37 , @xmath38 with the coulomb interaction . as in the cases of @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 the critical density is not much affected by the coulomb interaction but the critical temperature is decreased by only @xmath4 mev in this case .",
    "if the results of @xmath39 and 0.1 are compared one can observe that the shift in critical point is larger when the coulomb interaction is not considered .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the coulomb interaction on the liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter using molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "we have performed simulations for a wide range of density and temperature with and without coulomb interaction for this purpose .",
    "we have considered both symmetric nuclear matter , relevant for heavy - ion physics as well as asymmetric matter with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , important for supernova and neutron star matter , respectively . to determine the phase transition region",
    "we have calculated the two - point correlation functions of the fluctuations of nucleon densities . the temperatures at which the transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase take place at various densities are obtained by determining the location where the long - range correlations vanish .",
    "we also determine the critical point of the liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter for all three @xmath41s considered here .",
    "we found that although the coulomb interaction lowers the critical temperature by @xmath42 mev for nuclear matter with @xmath2 and 0.3 and by @xmath4 mev for @xmath5 , the critical density remains more or less unchanged .",
    "it could also be observed that the the densities at which the liquid - gas transition takes place at @xmath43 , is higher if the coulomb interaction is not considered for the cases of @xmath2 and 0.3 .",
    "however , for @xmath5 , there is not much difference in the transition density . for this highly asymmetric matter",
    "the difference between the phase diagrams with and without coulomb is much smaller than for the other two values of @xmath41 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the symmetry energy dominates over the coulomb energy in this highly asymmetric matter .",
    "based on these findings we plan to investigate susceptibilities of particle numbers around the phase transition line and critical end - point , as such studies are directly related to the more general search for observable signals of structures in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter comparing to observables from heavy - ion collisions .",
