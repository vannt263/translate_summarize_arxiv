    "the crab nebula belongs to the class of filled - center supernova remnants ( snr ) @xcite , i.e. without any detected shell component , and is well studied in almost all wavelength bands of the electromagnetic spectrum from the radio ( @xmath17  ev ) to very high energy @xmath0-rays ( nearly @xmath18  ev ) .",
    "it is held to be the archetypical pulsar wind nebula , even though its physical and spectral properties are unique .",
    "it is associated with the supernova explosion reported by chinese astronomers in 1054 ad .",
    "several models ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) describe the photon production processes taking place in this nebula .",
    "synchrotron radiation from high energy electrons in the nebular magnetic field is responsible for the observed spectrum from radio to mev , while inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of the primary accelerated electrons off the synchrotron photons , far infrared and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) produces high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "while these two mechanisms seem to provide a reasonable description of the overall non - thermal radiation of the crab nebula , one can not exclude possible deviations from this simplified picture , and @xcite proposed that significant production of high energy @xmath0-rays by bremsstrahlung radiation of relativistic electrons could take place in the crab filaments .",
    "this paper , reporting the results of a precise spectral analysis of the crab nebula between 100  mev and 300  gev , adds new elements to this discussion .    at the center of the nebula",
    "lies the crab pulsar , psr  j0534 + 2200 , one of the most energetic known pulsars ( spin down power of @xmath19 = 4.6 @xmath8 10@xmath20 erg  s@xmath11 ) , located at a distance of ( 2.0 @xmath1 0.2 ) kpc .",
    "estimation of its characteristic age using its rotation period ( @xmath21  ms ) and derivative ( @xmath22  s / s ) yields an age of 1240 years , close to the observational value .",
    "the energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ( egret ) , on orbit from 1991 to 2001 on board of the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) , reported the high energy detection of the crab nebula and pulsar @xcite .",
    "a more detailed study of the @xmath0-ray emission was then provided by @xcite , presenting a complete phase - resolved spectral analysis of the egret data , and more recently by @xcite , describing the first agile timing results on @xmath0-ray pulsars , including the crab .",
    "pulsations of the crab pulsar were reported above 25 gev by the major atmospheric gamma - ray imaging cherenkov telescope ( magic ) collaboration @xcite , with a light curve consistent with the one measured by egret .",
    "observations of the crab pulsar in high energy @xmath0-rays can provide strong constraints on the location of the @xmath0-ray emitting regions : above the polar caps @xcite , in the intermediate models like the slot gap @xcite , or far from the neutron star in the outer gaps @xcite .",
    "in particular , the spectral analysis and the phase - resolved behaviour examined in this paper may be used to discriminate between these models .",
    "successfully launched on june 11 , 2008 , the large area telescope ( lat ) , aboard the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , formerly glast , offers the unique opportunity to study the high energy behaviour of the crab pulsar and nebula in great detail . in this paper , we report the results of the analysis of the crab region using 8 months of survey observations with the _ fermi_-lat . in sections  [ radio ] and [ lat ] ,",
    "we describe the radio and @xmath0-ray observations used , while section  [ results ] presents the results obtained from a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the lat data .",
    "finally , in sections  [ discussion ] and [ summary ] , we discuss and summarize the main implications of these results for models of both the pulsar and the nebula .",
    "the crab pulsar , like many young pulsars , is affected by significant timing noise and glitches in rotation rate .",
    "because of the long time interval considered in this article , the rotational phase behaviour with time has to be known with extreme precision .",
    "the crab pulsar is one of the more than two hundred pulsars of large spin - down luminosity @xmath19 monitored by the lat pulsar timing campaign @xcite coordinated among _",
    "fermi _ , radio and x - ray telescopes .",
    "the timing solution for the crab pulsar has been built using observations made with the nanay radio telescope ( france ) @xcite and the jodrell bank observatory 42 foot mkia telescope ( england ) @xcite .",
    "a total of 698 times of arrival ( toas ) has been recorded between june 20 , 2008 and april 8 , 2009 .",
    "the radio toa dataset comprises 210 observations at 1.4 ghz and 488 observations at 600 mhz , in order to constrain the dispersion measure during the interval of the @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "this quantity is known to be highly variable , because of moving filaments in the crab nebula which make the column density of electrons along the line - of - sight change in time .",
    "the tempo2 timing package @xcite was used to build the timing solution from the 698 toas .",
    "the mean time of arrival uncertainties are 2.66 and 15.64 @xmath2s for the nanay and the jodrell bank observatory observations , respectively .",
    "we fit the toas to the pulsar rotation frequency and its first two derivatives , as well as to the dispersion measure ( dm ) and its first derivative ( dm1 ) to take the variation of the electron column density into account .",
    "the fit further includes 10 harmonically - related sinusoids , using the `` fitwaves '' option in the tempo2 package , to flatten the timing noise .",
    "we obtain dm  =  ( 56.7037  @xmath1  0.0003 ) @xmath23  pc and dm1  =  ( 3.05  @xmath1  0.10 )  @xmath8  10@xmath24 @xmath23  pc  yr@xmath11 on november 11 , 2008 .",
    "the post - fit rms is 21.1 @xmath2s , allowing for analyses of the @xmath0-ray pulse profile with unprecedented precision .",
    "the lat is an electron - positron pair conversion telescope , sensitive to @xmath0-rays with energies from below 20 mev to more than 300 gev .",
    "it consists of a high - resolution converter tracker ( direction measurement of the incident @xmath0-rays ) , a csi(tl ) crystal calorimeter ( energy measurement ) and an anticoincidence detector to discriminate the background of charged particles @xcite . in comparison to its predecessor egret",
    ", the lat has a larger effective area ( @xmath12 8000 @xmath25 on - axis ) , a broader field of view ( @xmath12 2.4 sr ) and a superior angular resolution ( @xmath12 0.6@xmath26 68@xmath27 containment at 1 gev for events converting in the front section of the tracker ) .",
    "the following analysis was performed on 248 days of data taken in survey mode ( august 02 , 2008  april 07 , 2009 ) .",
    "events from the `` diffuse '' class are selected , i.e. the highest quality photon data , having the most stringent background rejection .",
    "in addition , we exclude the events with zenith angles greater than 105@xmath26 due to the earth s bright @xmath0-ray albedo .",
    "the selected @xmath0-rays were phase - folded using the timing solution described in section  [ radio ] .",

    "=  22.01446@xmath26 ( j2000 ) , are selected .",
    "this choice takes into account the instrument performance and maximizes the signal to noise ratio . at high energies ,",
    "the background is relatively faint compared to the crab emission , so that a radius larger than the point spread function ( psf ) can be kept .    using this energy - dependent region ,",
    "the @xmath0-ray light curve above 100 mev is presented in figures  [ phaso_general ] and [ phaso_multilambda ] ( g ) .",
    "we have 22601 @xmath0-rays among which we estimate 14563 @xmath1 240 pulsed photons after background subtraction .",
    "phase histograms in radio ( from the nanay radio telescope ) , optical @xcite , x - rays @xcite , hard x - rays @xcite , @xmath0-rays ( cgro comptel and egret , @xcite ) and very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath0-rays ( magic , @xcite ) are also plotted in figure  [ phaso_multilambda ] .",
    "we did not search for any correlation between giant pulses and @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "the phase 0 is taken at the maximum of the main radio peak observed at 1.4 ghz , as seen in figures  [ phaso_general ] and [ phaso_multilambda ] ( a ) . considering all events between 100 mev and 300 gev , two clear peaks p1 and p2 can be seen at phase @xmath29  =  0.9915  @xmath1  0.0005 and @xmath30  =  0.3894  @xmath1  0.0022 , respectively .",
    "hence , the peaks are separated by @xmath31  =  0.398  @xmath1  0.003 .",
    "p1 and p2 are asymmetric .",
    "their shapes can be well modeled by two half - lorentzian functions ( with different widths for the leading and trailing sides ) .",
    "the first peak presents rising and falling edges of half - widths 0.045  @xmath1  0.002 and 0.023  @xmath1  0.001 respectively .",
    "p2 shows a slow rise and a steeper fall .",
    "the rising and falling edges of p2 have lorentzian half - widths of 0.115  @xmath1  0.015 and 0.045  @xmath1  0.008 respectively .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-ray first peak leads the radio main pulse by phase 0.0085  @xmath1  0.0005 , as shown in figure  [ phaso_general ] , where the radio profile ( red line ) is overlaid for comparison .",
    "the second @xmath0-ray peak leads the second 1.4 ghz radio pulse ( interpulse ) by 0.0143  @xmath1  0.0022 in phase .",
    "the peak separation is slightly wider at 1.4 ghz than in @xmath0-rays .",
    "an error in these @xmath0-radio delays can also arise from the measurement of the dispersion measure and its derivative .",
    "following @xcite , the error on the dispersion delay in the propagation of a signal at a frequency @xmath32 through the interstellar medium is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 takes into account the error on the measurement of dm and its derivative , and k = 2.410 @xmath8  10@xmath35 mhz@xmath24  @xmath23  pc  s@xmath11 is the dispersion constant .",
    "this yields a formal uncertainty of 1.4  @xmath2s , which is significantly smaller than the 21.1  @xmath2s accuracy of the overall timing solution , and therefore leads to an error of 0.0006 in phase on the @xmath0-radio delay .",
    "the presence of a radio feature referred to as low frequency component ( lfc ) by @xcite can be noticed , at phase 0.896  @xmath1  0.001 on the radio light curve obtained at 1.4  ghz as seen in figures  [ phaso_general ] and [ phaso_multilambda ] ( a ) .",
    "this peak is assumed to be near the closest approach of the magnetic axis .",
    "the first @xmath0-ray peak lags the lfc by 0.095  @xmath1  0.002 in phase .",
    "figure  [ phasos_six ] shows the light curves in 5 energy bands , covering the 100 mev  300 gev interval while table  [ table_phaso ] reports the evolution of the positions of the peak maxima ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 for p1 and p2 respectively ) and their half - widths ( hw ) , for the energy bins between 100  mev and 10  gev .",
    "the photon number counts above 10 gev were not sufficient to fit the peak profiles .",
    "the phases of the first ( p1 ) and second ( p2 ) peaks do not show any significant shift with energy . both become narrower when the energy increases , showing in particular a steepening in the p2 falling edge .",
    "table  [ table_phaso ] also presents the energy dependence of the relative weight of the two peaks .",
    "the diffuse and nebular background photon density has been first estimated in the 0.52  0.87 phase interval , then renormalized and subtracted so as to determine the number of pulsed photons in both peaks .",
    "p1 and p2 are here defined in the 0.87  1.07 and 0.27  0.47 phase intervals respectively . as for the vela pulsar @xcite",
    ", the ratio p1/p2 decreases with increasing energy , especially above a few gev .",
    "we define the off - pulse window as the 0.52  0.87 phase range , due to the bright emission of the pulsar in the rest of the phase . in the light curve above 10 gev",
    ", we can notice an enhancement indicating a potential third peak at phase @xmath12  0.74 , coincident with the radio peak observed between 4.7 and 8.4  ghz and referred to as high frequency component 2 ( hfc2 ) by @xcite .",
    "the excess above the background level ( estimated at 2.10 counts per bin , with a bin width of 0.02 in phase ) is 13.8 photons in the off - pulse interval .",
    "the statistical significance of this third peak , 2.3  @xmath36 , is therefore too low to claim a definite detection and a third peak will not be considered separately in the analysis of the crab nebula .",
    "figure  [ cmap ] shows the counts maps of pulsed and nebular emission in a 15@xmath26  @xmath8  15@xmath26 region centered on the pulsar radio position , for different energy bands .",
    "the nebular emission seen in the off - pulse window has been renormalized to the total phase ( bottom row ) and subtracted from the whole phase emission , to obtain the maps presenting the pulsed emission only ( top row ) .",
    "the positions of the pulsar and nebula are coincident to within our angular resolution and the nebula appears as a point - like source .",
    "while the pulsed emission dominates in the on - pulse window , the nebula stands out in the off - pulse interval from the emission of the diffuse background at high energy only .",

    "<S> the improved sensitivity and the unprecedented statistics afforded by the lat enable precise measurement of the crab pulsar spectral parameters : cut - off energy at @xmath3  =  ( @xmath4 )  gev , spectral index of @xmath5  =  ( @xmath6 ) and integral photon flux above 100 mev of @xmath7 )  @xmath8  10@xmath9 @xmath10  s@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the first errors represent the statistical error on the fit parameters , while the second ones are the systematic uncertainties . pulsed @xmath0-ray photons </S>",
    "<S> are observed up to @xmath12  20 gev which precludes emission near the stellar surface , below altitudes of around 4 to 5 stellar radii in phase intervals encompassing the two main peaks . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed phase - resolved spectral analysis is also performed : the hardest emission from the crab pulsar comes from the bridge region between the two @xmath0-ray peaks while the softest comes from the falling edge of the second peak . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the nebula in the energy range 100 mev  300 gev is well described by the sum of two power - laws of indices @xmath13  =  ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15  =  ( @xmath16 ) , corresponding to the falling edge of the synchrotron and the rising edge of the inverse compton components , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this latter , which links up naturally with the spectral data points of cherenkov experiments , is well reproduced via inverse compton scattering from standard magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) nebula models , and does not require any additional radiation mechanism . </S>"
