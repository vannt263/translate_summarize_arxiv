    "as many indices as possible are fit to the model . because most indices contain some information regarding each of the stellar parameters ( proctor & sansom 2002 ) , using this fitting technique has advantages of including all possible information recorded in all absorption line indices to measure these parameters .",
    "another advantage of this fitting technique is that it identifies indices that are highly deviant from model values , permitting their exclusion from the fitting process .",
    "in addition , we note that parameters measured in this way are less prone to uncertainties in data reduction such as flux calibration , stray cosmic ray and also less prone to weak emission effects ( proctor , forbes & beasley 2004 ) .",
    "therefore we start by fitting all 16 indices . the indices which deviate by more than @xmath40 are clipped and the @xmath6 fit recalculated .",

    "( 2006 ) to shift the zero points of the model to our data .",

    "defined the reference point as a set of previously published stellar population parameters for the central massive early - type galaxy in the cluster of their study .",

    "the initial measured age , [ z / h ] and [ e / fe ] of these two central apertures are considered as a reference zero point for that galaxy .",
    "we measure the offset between each index from the corresponding values in the model , at fixed age and metallicity as estimated by the initial fit .",
    "then we apply similar shifts to the indices of all other apertures . after applying this shift ,",
    "the number of highly deviant indices from the model is reduced and consequently larger number of indices are used during the fitting process which become much faster . examining the extracted stellar population parameters before and after shifting the indices , we find that they are similar .",

    "the gas - rich merger simulation of bekki & shioya ( 1999 ) predicts a one - to - one correlation between the age gradient and metallicity gradient .",
    "however , our isolated galaxies show a correlation of slope @xmath108 .",
    "both isolated galaxies , and those in hdes , show similar age - mass relations as more massive galaxies are older than smaller ones . that suggests either the less massive galaxies have had successive star formation events ( bursts induced by mergers ) continuing until recent epochs , while more massive galaxies did not suffer such events .",
    "alternatively , all galaxies started forming their stars in a single burst ( similar to a dissipative collapse ) at the same epoch which stopped earlier in more massive galaxies , while less massive galaxies continue forming new stars for extended epochs .",
    "several mechanisms have been introduced to suppress the star formation processes in more massive galaxies such as a central active galactic nuclei ( e.g. springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ; de lucia et al .",
    "the dependence of the star formation efficiency on the circular velocity of the galaxy can also delay the star formation in small galaxies relative to more massive galaxies ( e.g. de lucia et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the old galaxies in our sample ( ngc 2271 , eso153-g003 , eso218-g002 and mcg-03 - 26 - 030 ) with central age @xmath109 11 gyrs show flat age gradients which indicates that all stars are formed at same time at @xmath110 .",
    "they also tend to be the most massive galaxies .",
    "this can be a result of a single burst of star formation during a rapid collapse of a single cloud ( larson 1974 , 1975 ; calberg 1984 ) .",
    "the observed metallicity gradient of these galaxies ( @xmath111 ) is much less than the predicted gradients of the dissipative collapse models .",
    "the major merger scenario can explain the shallow metallicity gradients of these galaxies but not their uniform old populations .",
    "another mechanism such as developing central active galactic nuclei ( e.g. springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ; de lucia et al .",
    "2006 ) is necessary to stop any further star formation after the merger .",
    "the low metallicity of eso153-g003 ( [ z / h]@xmath112 ) suggests progenitors of relatively small size for this galaxy .",
    "the galaxy ngc 2271 has the highest metallicity among these galaxies ( [ z / h]@xmath113 ) with a flat metallicity gradient of .",
    "it also shows elongated shape ( @xmath114 ) and a solid body rotation with ( @xmath115 ( hau & forbes 2006 ) which may indicate amassive disk progenitor .",
    "the shallow metallicity gradients of the two galaxies ngc 682 and ngc 4240 indicate past major mergers . on the other hand ,",
    "their uniform luminosity weighted intermediate ages suggest a very small fraction of induced star formation .    the magnitude of the metallicity gradients are found to correlate to the age gradient .",
    "the suggested mechanism causing these gradients is that each star formation event will enrich the ism , followed by radial inflow , causing the subsequent stellar generations at the galaxy centre to be more metal - rich , as well as younger .",
    "a natural result of this process is the observed age - metallicity relation .",
    "the dynamical effect of supernova feedback is expected to be relatively weaker in more massive galaxies , consequently the star formation rate is more efficient in these galaxies than in less massive ones .",
    "the deep potential well of massive galaxies maintains their gas long enough to perform more complete chemical processes to produce higher metallicities ( e.g. arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; edmunds 1990 ; matteucci 1994 ) resulting in the observed mass - metallicity relation .",
    "independent of the galaxy mass , or the details of the merging process , the observed correlation between the metallicity gradient and its central value can be reproduced by the gas - rich merger simulations of bekki & shioya ( 1999 ) .",
    "the results of these models are also consistent with the observed insignificant gradients of [ e / fe ] within 1 effective radius of the isolated galaxies .    the parameter [ e / fe]@xmath1 measures the abundance ratio of the @xmath0-element to the fe - peak elements which are predicted to be released to the interstellar medium by supernovae type ii and ia and on different time scales .",
    "in that sense , [ e / fe]@xmath1 is commonly used to quantify the duration of star formation ( worthey , faber & gonzalez 1992 ; matteucci 1994 ; thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ; thomas et al .",
    "2005 ) . for the isolated galaxies as well as in hdes , the lower [ e / fe]@xmath1 of the less massive galaxies points to extended star formation for these galaxies",
    "however , the isolated early - type galaxies tend to have younger ages and lower [ e / fe]@xmath1 for their central velocity dispersion than their counterparts in hdes .",
    "furthermore , we also note that isolated galaxies of intermediate ages tend to have lower [ e / fe]@xmath1 than the galaxies in hdes .",
    "this is expected if the extended star formation is triggered with recent mergers which have stopped in hdes at higher redshifts but continue to recent epochs for galaxies in low density environments such as our isolated galaxies .",
    "isolated galaxies show a wide range of ages , [ z / h ] and [ e / fe ] for their central stellar populations .",
    "more massive galaxies tend to be older , more metal - rich and more @xmath0-element enhanced than less massive galaxies in the same sense as galaxies in high density environments .",
    "although isolated galaxies tend to be slightly younger , more metal - rich and lower [ e / fe ] for their mass .    the majority of the isolated galaxies in our sample show insignificant gradients of both age and [ e / fe ] .",
    "although a correlation between the age gradient and central age indicates the tendency of the newly formed stars to locate closer to the galaxy centre .",
    "the metallicity gradient ranges from very steep to flat .",
    "metallicity gradients are found to correlate with parameters of the central stellar populations such as central metallicity , age and velocity dispersions .",
    "metallicity gradients also show a remarkable correlation with the age gradients .",
    "the formation scenario of a single dissipative collapse cloud can not explain the spatial distribution of the stellar population and kinematic properties found for isolated galaxies .",
    "mergers at different redshifts of progenitors of different mass ratios and gas fractions are needed to reproduce the observed properties of the galaxies .",
