    "with the tremendous experimental progress @xcite in growing oxide heterostructures , new routes to engineer the dimensionality of materials have become available .",

    " dimensional systems . maybe not accidentally , in two dimensions also strong antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations prosper , without undergoing a phase transition to long - range order as in three dimensions .    besides two dimensionality , the electronic structure of the most prominent class of unconventional superconductors , the cuprate family ,",
    "is governed by a single cu @xmath3 orbital doped slightly away from half  filling .",
    "an important step towards a better understanding of cuprate superconductivity was taken by pavarini _",
    "@xcite who found an empirical trend in the material dependence of the critical temperature , t@xmath0 , at optimal doping . in the proposed scenario",
    "the material dependent parameter is the energy difference between the _ planar _ cu @xmath3 orbital at the fermi energy and an _ axial _",
    "cu @xmath4-like orbital at higher energy . in a recent letter",
    "@xcite , chaloupka and khaliullin proposed the artificial engineering of nickelate heterostructures with the aim of getting cuprate - like electronic structure and interplay between axial and planar orbitals .",
    "a possible realization are lanio@xmath1=lao - nio@xmath5 layers alternated with insulating layers such as laalo@xmath1=lao - alo@xmath5 with the same sequence of sub - layer charges .",
    "to avoid macroscopic polarization , the substrate on which the heterostructure is grown should preferably have the same sequence of sub - layer charges ( srtio@xmath1 may for instance not be suitable ) .",
    "we have shown that in these d@xmath6 heterostructures , the ni @xmath7 orbital can play the role of the _ axial _",
    "orbital@xcite ; it is pushed considerably above the planar ni @xmath3 orbital as an effect of either the coulomb interaction , an axially compressive strain , or control of the apical cation ( substitution of al by , e.g. , sc)@xcite so that a single fermi surface sheet with similar geometry and volume as in cuprates emerges , before the system becomes eventually insulating .",
    "the main focus of this complementary paper is a detailed analysis of the mott - hubbard transition taking place in the _ axial_/_planar _ two  band system and of the changes observed when going from the two dimensional heterostructure to three dimensional bulk nickelates .",
    "the latter can be viewed as a dimensional crossover , in which the cu @xmath7 degrees of freedom are more equivalent to the cu @xmath3 ones due to the lack of dimensional constraint .    for the purpose of this study ,",
    "we simplify the local - density - approximation ( lda ) bandstructure of ni @xmath8 orbitals by including merely the hopping between the first- and second - nearest neighbor ni d(e@xmath9 ) wannier orbitals , in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite where the full lda bandstructure was considered .",
    "this gives a quarter - filled two - band model for the @xmath8 degrees of freedom , i.e. , one electron in the two ni @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "we recall here that in transition metal oxides the transition metal ion is usually surrounded by an oxygen octahedron and , depending on the specific case , either @xmath10 ( as , e.g. , in vanadiumsesquioxide ) states or @xmath8 states ( as in the nickelates and cuprates ) play the most important role in determining the low energy excitations of the system .",
    "hence , our study of an @xmath8band model at quarter filling and the dimensional crossover from quasi ",
    "two to three - dimensional systems is of interest also from a more general perspective .",
    "moreover , since there are plenty of parameters governing the physics such as the bandwidth of the two bands , their crystal field splitting , the interband hybridization , the coulomb interaction , and last but not least the dimensionality , it is of great importance to derive such models from realistic bandstructures .",
    "this way we also make some contact to previous multi - band model studies @xcite where features such as the orbital selective mott transitions @xcite were analyzed .",
    "many of these multi  band studies made approximations , such as neglecting the hybridization between the orbitals .",
    "this poses the question in how far the employed models are applicable to real world materials . moreover , most of the aforementioned studies concentrated on half filling .    in section [ sec : model ]",

    "finally , we discuss the issue of magnetic order at low temperatures and derive an effective spin - orbital superexchange model in section [ sec : spinfluct ] , before we arrive at the conclusion in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "the cubic splitting is large enough so that the nominal filling in ni@xmath15 is @xmath17 ( completely filled ) and @xmath18 ( quarter filling ) . as a consequence",
    "we find two @xmath8 bands at quarter filling around the fermi energy to be the relevant degrees of freedom for the low energy excitations of the system @xcite .",
    "the insulating laalo@xmath11 layers give rise to the tetragonal distortion which splits the axial @xmath19 orbital @xmath20mev above the @xmath21 orbital and , more importantly , strongly reduce the width of the axial @xmath19 band by blocking the perpendicular hopping@xcite .    in order to obtain the model for our dmft study",
    "we construct a basis of localized ni @xmath8 wannier functions using the nth - order muffin - tin orbital method ( nmto ) like in ref .  , but now truncate the hoppings after those between second - nearest ni neighbors . for our purposes of model calculations",

    "the initial lifting of the orbital degeneracy ( the lda crystal - field splitting ) is expected to push the system in the direction of situation ( ii ) , which we observed for our model with an initial crystal field splitting of @xmath69 mev .",
    "the inter - orbital hybridization also gives rise to two effects .",

    "the second effect is more intrinsic in the sense that the hybridization makes the bands more similar , obviously pushing the system towards situation ( i ) .",

    "as mentioned above , the fingerprints of the hybridization can clearly be seen also in fig .",
