    "since their initial classification by @xcite narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ) have gained noteriety as interestingly extreme examples of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "they were initially defined by their relatively narrow permitted emission lines ( fwhm @xmath1 2000  km  s@xmath2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strong relative to h@xmath3 , and weak [ ] . in their analysis of 87 bright agn",
    ", @xcite found a strong anticorrelation between the strengths of the [ ] and lines ( the primary correlation behind their so - called eigenvector 1 or principal component 1 [ pc1 ] ) . nls1s",
    "lie at the extreme , low [ ] end of pc1 .",
    "the authors suggested that this may be due to a high accretion rate relative to the eddington rate .",
    "a more recent analysis by @xcite reinforces this claim , noting that nls1s consistently exhibit the lowest estimated central black hole masses for similar luminosities and the highest inferred relative accretion rates among the various agn types .",
    "much attention has been devoted in recent years to the x - ray spectra of nls1s . while agn have long been known to emit a substantial fraction of their luminosity as x - rays , a soft x - ray `` excess ''",
    "was noted among seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "boller , brandt , & fink ( 1996 ) found a strong anticorrelation between the x - ray photon index ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ) and fwhm(h@xmath3 ) , with nls1s having @xmath6 .",
    "consequently , selection on the basis of ultrasoft x - ray emission has proven effective in the discovery of new nls1s @xcite .",
    "this soft excess is thought to be the high - energy ( wien ) tail of thermal emission from the inner accretion disk .",
    "since extremely high temperatures are required to produce this emission , it again follows that nls1s may be powered by low - mass black holes at high relative accretion rates @xcite .    to date",
    ", a combination of x - ray and optical selection and serendipity has resulted in the discovery of a large number of nls1s ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) : for example , the sample compiled by ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter vvg01 ) consists of 64 nls1s with z  @xmath7  0.1 , b  @xmath7  17.0 , and @xmath8 , while the _ catalog of quasars and active nuclei _ ( 10th edition : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) lists 205 nls1s among seyferts and qsos .",
    "while these provide a starting point for studying the role of nls1s among agn phenomena , the sample size is relatively small and quite heterogeneous due to the wide variety of selection criteria employed .",
    "since many known nls1s were first discovered in x - rays , it is difficult to ascertain with confidence whether the extreme x - ray softness exhibited by most catalogued nls1s is a fundamental property or a subtle selection effect .",
    "clearly , a large and homogeneous optically selected sample would be advantageous in resolving these issues .",
    "such a sample is now becoming available in the form of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in particular the early data release ( edr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , released in mid-2001 .",
    "the edr contains spectra of approxmiately 4000 quasars @xcite as well as a large number of seyfert galaxies and other agn .",
    "photometric data are measured in five bands ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and criteria based on these bands are used to select qso candidates for spectroscopic follow - up , as described in @xcite .",
    "parameters such as redshifts , magnitudes and linewidths are stored in a searchable database , with photometric properties in the `` photoobj '' class and spectral properties in the `` specobj '' and `` specline '' classes .",
    "this database also has built into it an `` externalcatalog '' class , which contains all edr objects within 60   of objects catalogued in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) , as well as some rosat - measured properties of these objects ( see section  [ xrayprop ] ) .    by submitting a query restricted to objects with narrow h@xmath3 emission lines and then analyzing the resulting spectra ,",
    "we have identified 150 nls1s in the edr , only two of which have been previously classified as such . in the following section we discuss in more detail the selection criteria and subsequent analysis .",
    "the overall selection methods and optical properties are discussed , as well as objects which were previously known and/or misidentified .",
    "finally , we report on those objects which were also observed in rass , and give possible reasons why some were not detected when they should have been .",
    "using the sdss query tool , we searched for spectroscopically - targeted objects which were flagged as qsos and which exhibited narrow h@xmath3 lines .",
    "velocity dispersions were estimated through the relation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the data member `` sigma '' in the sdss specline class , denoting the value of @xmath12 for a gaussian curve fit to each h@xmath3 line . to account for the possibility that the recorded dispersion estimates are subject to systematics , we initially relaxed the selection criteria , excluding only objects with fwhm(h@xmath3 )  @xmath13  3000  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting 950 spectra were then visually inspected and measured to identify the nls1s .",
    "many of these spectra exhibited characteristics of seyfert 1.5 and seyfert 2 galaxies ( strong [ ] compared to h@xmath3 , no evidence of , obvious broad components h@xmath3 and h@xmath14 , etc . ) , while others were too faint or noisy to classify .",
    "all in all , this initial cut removed about half of the candidates from the sample .",
    "the remaining objects generally exhibit the combination of narrow h@xmath3 , strong and weak [ ] emission characteristic of nls1s .",
    "each spectrum was first transformed from the space used by sdss onto a linear wavelength scale and smoothed with a three - pixel fwhm gaussian filter .",
    "the smoothing step is analogous to that used in the edr presentation spectra returned as .gif files .",
    "we then performed a quadratic continuum fit near the h@xmath3 line , measured its peak wavelength with a centroiding algorithm , and measured the width of the line halfway between the fitted continuum and the line peak .",
    "since this method makes no assumptions about the underlying emission - line profile , we took this to be an accurate measurement of fwhm(h@xmath3 ) .",
    "all objects which exhibited a velocity dispersion larger than 2000  km  s@xmath2 , as well as those with evidence of a weak very broad component in h@xmath3 or h@xmath14 ( when the latter was visible in the sdss spectral band ) , were removed .",
    "the remaining 150 objects thus satisfy the @xcite criteria and @xcite fwhm cutoff , and comprise the nls1 catalog presented here ( see table  [ tbl ] ) .",
    "three of these nls1 spectra are shown in figure  [ f1 ] , illustrating the spectral shape and appearance for various redshift and fwhm(h@xmath3 ) regimes .",
    "it is interesting to note the concordance between our measurements and those reported in the sdss edr database ; namely , those of the redshift and h@xmath3 linewidth .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows excellent agreement between the two redshift measurements with typical errors of 0.2% or less .",
    "our redshift measurements are systematically higher by about 0.1% , but this is most likely due to properties of the h@xmath3 line itself since we base this redshift only on h@xmath3 , rather than on the narrow forbidden lines that are probably more representative of the systemic redshifts of the galaxies .",
    "when the most discrepant redshifts were re - measured using narrow forbidden lines ( such as [ ] @xmath15 ) , our redshifts fall much more in line with the sdss measurements . since sdss bases their redshift measurement on a cross - correlation between many lines and ours",
    "is only based on h@xmath3 , we take the sdss results to be the more accurate and definitive .    on the other hand , there are large discrepancies between our fwhm measurements and those estimated from the sdss `` sigma '' parameter ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) . not only is there a significant amount of scatter , but our measurements are systematically lower than the sdss estimates .",
    "most of the scatter is probably caused by the @xmath16/pixel spectral resolution .",
    "that is , if our fwhm measurements vary intrinsically by @xmath17  pixels , this would correspond to an rms variation of @xmath18  km  s@xmath2 , which is very close to the observed scatter .",
    "the systematic offset is probably due to several factors .",
    "first , such a discrepancy is not particularly surprising since the sdss fwhm is based on a gaussian fit to a profile better represented by a lorentzian or more complicated shape ( see , for example , vvg01 ) .",
    "these are compounded by the proximity of the complexes on either side of h@xmath3 , which tends to drive the automatically - fitted continuum used by the sdss analysis pipeline higher depending on the strength . in some cases",
    ", the line - fitting algorithm employed by sdss appears to select only a broad component in the h@xmath3 line , again giving larger fwhm values than our measurements .",
    "thus , while sdss measurements are quite useful for initial linewidth - based selection , careful follow - up measurements are absolutely necessary to take into account peculiarities in the individual spectra .",
    "table  [ tbl ] lists the 150 objects which comprise this sample , along with various measured parameters and previous references to the catalogued objects , found through a nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) query .",
    "although 48 objects had been picked up in surveys such as 2df , 2mass , lbqs , and various other projects , most had not been formally classified as nls1s . of these , only two have been previously identified as nls1s : sdss j014644.82004043.2 ( vvg01 ) , and sdss j010226.31003904.6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite list another , sdss j011703.58 + 000027.4 ( also known as e0114 - 002 ) , as a seyfert 1 with fwhm(h@xmath3)@xmath192980  km  s@xmath2 , substantially higher than our measurement of 975  km  s@xmath2 ; however , the authors mention that this object s h@xmath3 line may be contaminated .",
    "such contamination was not evident in the sdss spectrum , so we have included this object in our nls1 sample .",
    "the remaining objects are listed in ned under such generic labels as `` qso , '' `` agn , '' or `` seyfert . '' a few are flagged as `` sy1 , '' but it is unclear whether these were classified before @xcite first defined the nls1 class . in the interest of brevity , table  [ tbl ] contains special references only to those objects flagged as some type of seyfert galaxy in ned .",
    "all in all , this sample represents 150 spectroscopically - selected nls1s . while it significantly increases the number of known nls1s , the homogeneous sample selection criteria ( through use of the sdss edr catalog ) make it particularly useful for studies of the overall nls1 population . for @xmath20 ( where most of our objects lie )",
    ", there are 135 objects in our sample out of 944 flagged as qsos in the edr .",
    "if we take this to be representative of the overall quasar population , this would imply that nls1s make up roughly 15% of agn at low redshifts .",
    "until a more definitive selection of both nls1s and qsos is made from the sdss , this number is only a rough approximation .",
    "however , this is comparable to the number quoted by @xcite .",
    "the nls1s we have found in the sdss edr span a range of redshifts from 0.04 to 0.75 , the upper bound set by the requirement that [ ] @xmath15  not exceed the sdss spectrograph limit of @xmath21   ( though in practice only three objects have @xmath22 ) . although @xcite warn that the quasar selection criteria are inhomogeneous for the edr , the criteria for objects at these lower redshifts are actually quite well defined @xcite .",
    "since nls1s are identified primarily by the h@xmath3 velocity dispersion and the [ ] and lines surrounding h@xmath3 , we did not attempt to find nls1-like agn at redshifts beyond the range where h@xmath3 is seen .",
    "furthermore , a search for narrow - lined objects in the sdss galaxy database yielded over 20,000 candidates , and thus it was not feasible to consider objects in that database with the selection methods described in this paper . by restricting ourselves to objects flagged as qso , our sample also falls within the sdss qso color selection criteria described in @xcite , making the basic selection very well understood .",
    "even with these restrictions , there are enough objects to undertake a study of characteristics of this nls1 sample .      when these 150 objects are cross - referenced with the rosat all - sky survey catalogue ( using an sdss externalcatalog query ) , we find that 52 lie within 60  of x - ray detected sources .",
    "power - law slopes were estimated using the rosat hardness ratio 1 parameter ( hr1 ) , which is defined as @xcite : @xmath23 here , a and b denote the number of counts in the 0.10.4 and 0.52.0  kev bands , respectively .",
    "note that if there are zero counts in band a or b , hr1 becomes + 1 or 1 respectively . by using hr1 and the sensitivity curve of rosat ( as implemented in the pimms program ) and galactic @xmath24 obtained from the `` nh '' utility , it is possible to estimate the x - ray photon indices of rosat - detected nls1s .    of the 52 x - ray detected nls1s in our sample ,",
    "7 have hardness ratios equal to ( or within @xmath25 of ) + 1 or 1 , with two in the former group and five in the latter .",
    "this may be indicitave of extremely hard or soft x - ray spectra , respectively .",
    "however , these seven objects are all fairly faint in x - rays ( @xmath1 0.04 counts  s@xmath2 ) and the two with @xmath26 have unusually high galactic column densities ; thus , it is unlikely that these seven objects have unusually hard or soft spectral energy distributions .",
    "power - law slopes were estimated with pimms for the remaining 45  nls1s and plotted against fwhm(h@xmath3 ) ( see figure  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "as in @xcite , the photon indices of this sample of nls1s span a range from approximately @xmath27 with little or no apparent dependence on the h@xmath3 linewidth .",
    "in particular , we note that the vast majority of these sources exhibit ultrasoft spectra with @xmath28 , as was seen in previous samples of soft x - ray selected nls1s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "redshift and @xmath29 color distributions are shown in figures  [ f5 ] and  [ f6 ] respectively , with rosat - detected objects shown as the shaded portion of each histogram .",
    "most of these rass sources are optically bright ( @xmath30 ; additionally , there appears to be a slight bias toward sources with lower redshifts and galactic column densities . even with this taken into account by excluding objects with @xmath31",
    ", we still see several optically - bright , low redshift sources which should have been easily detected by rass assuming similar spectral energy distributions , but which were not ( see figure  [ f7 ] ) .",
    "there are two likely interpretations for this .",
    "the first is that these undetected sources could have x - ray properties similar to the detected sources , but the soft x - rays are suppressed by a large ( @xmath32  @xmath33 ) intrinsic column density .",
    "if this were the case , we would expect to see a pronounced difference in the spectral continuum shapes and/or the photometric colors between the objects that are detected in x - ray and those that are not ; however , no such reddening is seen .",
    "the soft x - ray weak objects could be members of a gas - rich and dust - poor population ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would account for the apparent lack of visual extinction , but this seems somewhat contrived .",
    "the second possibility is that the undetected objects represent a new population of nls1s with intrinsically flatter ( and hence harder ) x - ray slopes . in this case",
    ", the lack of soft x - rays would be due to a fundamental difference in the central black hole and accretion disk properties .",
    "for example , if these objects had larger black hole masses and high accretion rates , the accretion disk spectral energy distribution would shift to lower energies , effectively flattening out the 0.12  kev spectrum .",
    "assuming similar spectral properties , these nls1s would not have been detected in the rass .",
    "it should also be noted that strong x - ray variability could result in a significant fraction of nls1s not detected by rass .",
    "however , it is unlikely that such a large number of bright nls1s would exhibit this degree of variability , and would coincidentally be x - ray faint at the time of observation by rass .",
    "whichever interpretation is correct , the x - ray undetected nls1s are possibly something new and intriguing within nls1 phenomena .",
    "further x - ray observations of these nls1s over a larger energy range with higher sensitivity may help to decipher the underlying cause of this observation .",
    "the 150 sdss - selected nls1s presented in this paper represent a significant increase in the total known number of these extreme agn .",
    "they comprise approximately 15% of the edr `` qso '' database at @xmath34 and have very well - defined color and linewidth selection criteria .",
    "45 of these nls1s were also detected with good confidence in the 0.12  kev band of the rosat all - sky survey and exhibit ultrasoft x - ray spectra .",
    "of the nls1s that were _ not _ detected , several have similar optical properties to nls1s seen in the rass , and thus should have been detected as well .",
    "this may be due to either high intrinsic absorption or harder x - ray spectra ( or both ) among the undetected objects .",
    "more optical and x - ray data will almost certainly be helpful in determining the cause behind this .",
    "it should also be noted that while most of our objects clearly fall within the defining nls1 criteria , a substantial fraction are near the 2000  km  s@xmath2 fwhm cutoff .",
    "additionally , several of the spectra had low signal  to  noise ratios .",
    "this may hide characteristics ( such as a broad component in h@xmath3 ) which would reclassify the object as a seyfert 1.5 or other type .",
    "while these objects all appear to be nls1s from the data given , it is likely that some may be reclassified when higher resolution , higher signal - to - noise spectra are obtained .",
    "thus , this sample should be considered a list of very strong nls1 candidates rather than a definitive list .",
    "nevertheless , this sample demonstrates that large numbers of nls1s ( and other interesting objects ) with well - constrained selection criteria can indeed be found in the sdss early data release .",
    "since the edr represents only about 5% of the total spectroscopic survey @xcite , the full sdss catalog will provide a definitive resource for the discovery and study of nls1s .",

    "<S> we present a sample of 150 narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ) found within the sloan digital sky survey early data release ( edr ) , only two of which were previously identified as such . </S>",
    "<S> this substantially increases the known number of nls1s , and provides a basic method by which to identify many more with subsequent releases of sdss data . with its large size and homogeneous , well - defined selection criteria , </S>",
    "<S> this sample will help alleviate two major problems which have plauged nls1 research in the past ; namely , their relative rarity and significant differences in selection algorithms between the known samples . </S>",
    "<S> 45 of these sdss - selected nls1s are detected at energies of 0.12  kev in the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) , and are found to have ultrasoft x - ray spectra with photon indices of @xmath0 , in agreement with previous results for nls1s . </S>",
    "<S> however , about 1020 of those nls1s that were not detected by rosat have optical properties very similar to the detected objects , and so should also have been detected by the rass . </S>",
    "<S> this may be due to either significant intrinsic absorption in many nls1s , or a significant sub - class of nls1s that have uncharacteristic , intrinsically flatter ( hence harder ) x - ray spectral energy distributions . </S>"
