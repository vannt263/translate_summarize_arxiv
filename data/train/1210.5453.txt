    "<S> we investigate string correlations in an infinite - size spin-1/2 bond - alternating heisenberg chain . by employing the infinite matrix product state representation with the infinite time evolving block decimation method , a finite string correlation for extremely large lattice distances </S>",
    "<S> is _ directly _ observed , contrast to an extrapolated extreme value for finite size chains . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a topological quantum phase transition occurs between two different phases separated and characterized by two different long - range string orders in the space of bond - alternating interactions . </S>",
    "<S> also , the critical exponent @xmath0 from the long - range string orders is obtained as @xmath1 and the central charge at the critical point is obtained as @xmath2 , which shows that the topological phase transition belongs to the gussian universality class . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is shown that , for the topological quantum phase transition , the phase boundary can be captured by the singular behavior of the von neumann entropy and the pinch point of the fidelity per site . </S>"
