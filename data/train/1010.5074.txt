    "<S> , a similar situation has been known to be true already for a long time : in general one must regularize the single - shot expression , given by the coherent information , in order to attain the quantum capacity @xcite .    to contribute to fixing the coordinate system of channel capacities , this insight begs for a resolution of the following question : to what extent can entanglement help then ? is the mentioned result rather an academic observation , manifesting itself in small violations of additivity in high physical dimensions ? </S>",
    "<S> an interesting question in this context is the following : _ can suitably entangled inputs render noisy quantum channels take their maximum possible capacity or make them even perfect ? _ this would be the other extreme , where the non - additivity serves as a resource to overcome the noisiness of channels .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we answer this question to the negative : for all quantum channels , no matter how elaborate the entangled coding over many uses of the channel might be , one can never achieve the maximum possible capacity if this is not already true on the single - shot level . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath10where the maximum is taken over probability distributions and states , as the asymptotic regularization @xmath11 the trivial maximum value that the capacity can possibly take is given by the _ </S>",
    "<S> maximum output entropy _ of the quantum channel , @xmath12we will say that whenever this bound is saturated , so when @xmath13 , that the channel has _ maximum capacity _ , giving rise to the maximum that is trivially possible . </S>",
    "<S> of course , this notion includes the situation of a _ perfect quantum channel _ that has maximum output entropy of @xmath14 .    </S>",

    "<S> faithful_. that is , @xmath35 for bipartite states @xmath36 on @xmath3 and @xmath5 if and only if @xmath36 is entangled with respect to this split .    here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath37 denotes the _ entanglement of formation _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out , for any quantity satisfying property 1 , the following bound holds true :    [ cc ] for any quantum channel @xmath1 and any quantity @xmath29 that satisfies the condition 1 .  </S>",
    "<S> we find the single - shot upper bound @xmath38    the argument leading to this bound is remarkably simple : starting from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ cc ] ) , and defining @xmath39 with reductions @xmath40 , @xmath5 being formed by @xmath32 and @xmath6 by @xmath41 , we find , using the msw - correspondence @xcite , @xmath42using subadditivity , and hence , using property 1 , @xmath43which is the above single - shot bound of observation [ cc ] .    </S>",
    "<S> this bound is to be compared with the msw expression @xcite for the holevo-@xmath9 itself , @xmath44this is very similar , except that now the entanglement of formation takes the role of the quantity @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> this indeed leads also to the conclusion of observation [ perfect ] for the classical capacity : @xmath45 achieves the maximum upper bound @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 achieves it . </S>",
    "<S> this is because @xmath9 achieves it if and only if @xmath48for the maximizing @xmath36 in @xmath46 , which means that @xmath49 has to be separable . </S>",

    "<S> summary and outlook . </S>",
    "<S> _ in this work , we have investigated the converse question to the additivity problem : how much can entanglement help enhance capacities of quantum channels . in the focus of interest was the question whether entanglement can ever enhance the capacity to its trivial maximum if a single invocation does not yet reach that . </S>",
    "<S> we affirmatively answer that question to the negative , including the quantum and classical capacity . in doing so </S>",
    "<S> , we have established practical computable upper bounds to capacities , relating them to entanglement measures and rendering bounds and witnesses to the latter quantities useful to assess capacities . </S>",
    "<S> there is though an interesting challenge : all the quantities from our list exhibit a sort of monogamy , i.e. , for states which are highly sharable they have to be small , implying that the bounds may become loose . </S>",
    "<S> an example is a channel whose stinespring dilation gives rise to a @xmath92-dimensional anti - symmetric space . </S>",
    "<S> a normalized projector onto this subspace is @xmath92-sharable , which means that for large @xmath92 all our bounds would tend to @xmath93 , while a direct approach of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows that the capacity is bounded by a constant independent of @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> an open question is therefore how to find a quantity satisfying our property 1 , but that would not necessarily drop for sharable states . </S>",
    "<S> it is the hope that the present work triggers further work on how `` small '' violations of additivity really are in practice and what role entanglement plays after all in quantum communication .    _ </S>",
