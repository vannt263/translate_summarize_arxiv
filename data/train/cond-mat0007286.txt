    "over the past few years there has been growing interest in the critical behavior and phase separation of ionic fluids and of the hamiltonian model that has been most widely used in trying to understand the experimental results , the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) , which we shall discuss below .",
    "the interest stems in part from the fact that on the experimental side there has emerged no clear picture of universality in the critical behavior of these fluids of the sort that describes a wide variety of non - ionic fluids .",
    "for example , in a series of impressive experiments done on a family of ionic fluids , narayanan and pitzer@xcite have obtained results consistent with ising - like behavior .",
    "but within the family they studied , they encountered a wide range of reduced temperatures @xmath4 that mark the crossover from behavior well - described by mean - field theory to behavior that is ising - like as one approaches the critical temperature @xmath5 from above along the critical isochore .",
    "( some of the crossovers come at much smaller @xmath6 than encountered in the case of simple non - ionic fluids . )",
    "that means that not all members of the family can be well - described by the rpm ; whatever the crossover temperature of the rpm , it is given by a single reduced temperature @xmath6 according to the law of corresponding states .",
    "theoretical studies have revealed no simple ionic - fluid universality either .",
    "for example the most comprehensive simulation and theoretical studies both suggest that the critical point of the rpm is a simple liquid - gas critical point , whereas studies of lattice - gas versions of the rpm reveal that on simple cubic and body - centered cubic lattices one should expect tricriticality instead of simple criticality .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the situation one finds in non - ionic fluid models , where one has come to expect off - lattice and lattice models to share the same critical behavior .",
    "the shape of the phase diagram found in the continuous rpm from recent monte carlo simulations is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the critical behavior revealed by these simulations is consistent with a critical point related to the density fluctuations that represents an instability with respect to fluctuations of wave number @xmath7 . in the case of the rpm with the positions of the ions restricted to the lattice sites , i.e. , a lattice rpm ,",
    "quite different phase behavior has been found , both in simulation and in mean - field results as well as in a general theoretical study.@xcite from these references , what emerges is an instability of the uniform phase induced by charge fluctuations with wave number @xmath8 .",
    "the line of the second - order transition to the charge - ordered phase with the period @xmath9 just below the transition ( @xmath10-line ) appears to terminate at a tricritical point , which lies in a different range of densities and temperatures than the critical point found in the continuum - space rpm studies , as shown in fig.2 .    in order to better understand this question of universality in ionic - systems",
    "we have developed a field - theoretic approach for studying the boundary of stability of a uniform phase in such systems .",
    "as prototypic microscopic models we consider both the lattice and the continuous versions of the rpm . in our treatment the differences between the lattice and the continuous systems",
    "are reflected in different forms of the couplings in the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) functional , which has the same general structure in both cases . with our method",
    "we are able to reproduce the essential properties of ionic systems both for the continuous - space and the lattice rpm within one formalism .",
    "we can also include the effects of the short - range interactions between various species , i.e. extend our model beyond the rpm .",
    "as in the earlier lattice rpm studies we have cited , an instability of the uniform phase with respect to charge fluctuations with @xmath2 is already found at the mean - field level when we apply our approach to the lattice rpm .",
    "we find second - order and first - order transitions to a charge - ordered phase at temperatures above and below that of a tricritical point respectively .",
    "the density at the tricritical point is found to be @xmath11 on the simplest mean - field level for both the lattice and the continuous versions of our lg functional .",
    "the structure of the charge - ordered phase depends on whether the positions of the ions are or are not restricted to the lattice sites .",
    "in addition to the instability induced by the charge - fluctuations with @xmath2 , an instability related to the mass - fluctuations with @xmath7 occurs in a different region of thermodynamic space .",
    "this other instability , which has already been investigated on the mean - field level in the context of several standard ionic - fluid approaches applied directly to the continuum - space rpm can be detected when the charge - fluctuations are integrated out in our formalism .",
    "we find an equation for the critical point consistent with the fluid - theory result found previously by one of us.@xcite we also derive the effective functional depending only on density deviations from the average value , i.e. with the charge fluctuations integrated out . near the critical point",
    "this functional has the same form as the `` @xmath12 '' functional representing the ising universality - class .",
    "hence in our treatment of the rpm model the critical point induced by the mass fluctuations belongs to the ising universality class .",
    "since we find the tricritical point observed previously only in the lattice rpm as well as the liquid - gas type critical point found previously only in the continuous rpm our approach enables us to give a unified description of the continuum - model and lattice - model behavior of ionic systems .",
    "moreover , it sharply reveals two distict transitions that can be driven by the coulombic forces in such models .",
    "one is a transition from a charge - disordered to a charge - ordered phase .",
    "the other is a liquid - gas type transition that does not involve charge ordering at all . in the continuum - space version one",
    "expects at least two solid phases associated with different charge ordering@xcite as well as the fluid phase , and it may be that the locus of charge - ordering transitions we find in our field theoretic versions of the rpm will occur in the continuum - space rpm as a solid - solid transition , or when one passes from a fluid to solid state .",
    "a reliable description of transitions involving solid phases of the continuum - space rpm that can be used to give a global - description of both its fluid and solid phases requires going beyond the treatment we have given here .    in lattice - gas versions of the rpm",
    ", the details of the charge ordering that can occur will surely depend sensitively upon the lattice geometry and upon the extent of the core of the interparticle potential excluding multiple occupancy of neighboring sites as well as a central site as they do in non - ionic lattice - gas models.@xcite it seems likely that in some extended - core models , one will find both the liquid - gas - like criticality and phase separation characteristic of the continuum rpm as well as charge - ordering at higher densities involving phases that are also density ordered and hence solid - like .",
    "the lattice - gas version of the rpm and its extended - core generalization may well prove valuable in modelling the transitions one finds in the continuum - space rpm solid .    beyond the rpm we find evidence that the position of the tcp is extremely sensitive to the strength of the additional , short - range interactions , as for example the interactions between the ions and the particles of the solvent .",
    "for reasonable values of the parameter describing the effect of these interactions in a simple extension of the rpm we find within our formalism that the tcp lies in the immediate vicinity of the cp found in the recent simulations , either slightly above or slightly below the cp in temperature , with its location depending very sensitively on the values of the parameter describing the effect of the short - range interactions .",
    "this raises the possibility that in some real ionic fluids in which there are substantial short - range interaction involving the solvent , one might find a tcp realizable in the liquid state or incipient as a tcp involving metastable liquid phases .",
    "our choice is designed to be relevant to a lattice - gas version of the rpm as well as variants thereof , such as the standard off - lattice rpm and an extension that includes the effect of ion - solvent interactions .    in order to study criticality in ionic systems within a field - theoretic framework",
    ", we first construct an appropriate landau - ginzburg ( lg ) functional .",
    "we start the construction by calculating the grand thermodynamical potential @xmath13 in the mf approximation . for the mixture",
    "@xmath13 has the form @xmath14 +   \\beta \\big ( u^{mf } [ \\rho_{\\alpha}({\\bf r } ) ] - \\int d{\\bf r } \\mu_{\\alpha } \\rho_{\\alpha}({\\bf r})\\big).\\ ] ] in the lattice case the integration in ( [ eqn : eqno1 ] ) should be replaced by a summation over the lattice sites , with the lattice constant @xmath15 equal to the diameter of the ions .",

    "more accurate forms of @xmath20 in the continuous models will affect the explicit expressions for the coupling constants of the final lg functional , but not its general structure .    for the rpm model @xmath24 correspond to a cation ,",
    "an anion or a solvent particle ( a ` hole ' ) respectively , and @xmath13 can be expressed in terms of the local charge @xmath25 and ion - mass @xmath26 densities .",

    "these restrictions have a strong effect on the form of @xmath19 in the fourier representation .",

    "the @xmath236 depends on @xmath237 through @xmath183 and @xmath184 , which in turn are functions of @xmath185 and @xmath238 ( see eq.([eqn : eqno28 ] ) and below ) .",
    "the function @xmath171 is determined by the charge fluctuations , and for @xmath3 depends on the whole spectrum of the fluctuations , as one can see from the lowest - order approximation for @xmath239 , @xmath240 , given by eq.([eqn : eqno23b ] ) .",
    "because of that dependence on the shape of @xmath241 , the position of the cp , @xmath242 , also depends on the form of @xmath241 . in particular , for different systems , characterized in our theory by different forms of @xmath243 ( as , for example , the continuous ( [ eqn : eqno11b ] ) and the lattice ( [ eqn : eqno11c ] ) models ) the relative locations of a possible cp signaling an ising - like transition and a possible locus of transitions to a charge - ordered phase can be quite different .",
    "as a result , one or the other of these transitions can be preempted by the occurrence of the other .",
    "thus the continuum - space rpm fluid appears to support only the cp while the cubic lattice - gas rpm appears to support only the charge - ordering transition with an attendant tcp",
    ". it will require analysis beyond that given here to locate the cp in our field - theoretic approach .",
    "here we limit ourselves to the continuous case .",
    "the lattice case is described in ref .  [ 17 ] . on our level of description",

    "@xmath246 and @xmath88 differ , respectively , from those of eqs.([eqn : eqno10a ] ) and  ( [ eqn : eqno10b ] ) , which refer to the absence of the short - range interactions .",

    ". they should be thus comparable to the typical distance between the ions and the particles of the solvent . for our length unit both should be thus of order of unity .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath246 and @xmath88 given by ( [ eqn : eqno10a ] ) and ( [ eqn : eqno10b ] ) and to a single length @xmath249 , to illustrate on the simplest level the crucial role of the interactions beyond the rpm on the position of the @xmath10-line and the tricritical point .",
    "the bifurcation analysis of the extended functional ( [ eqn : eqno9a ] ) , which in addition contains the terms @xmath250 and @xmath251 , gives the generalization of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : eqno12a ] ) and  ( [ eqn : eqno12b ] ) for the bifurcation line @xmath252 and @xmath253 the tcp is very sensitive to the changes of @xmath254 and is given by the analysis of ref .",

    "( [ eqn : eqno39a ] ) and  ( [ eqn : eqno39b ] ) we find the tcp for two slightly different values of @xmath254 , @xmath262 and @xmath263 at @xmath264 and @xmath265 respectively .",
    "note that in the first case the tcp lies slightly above the rpm cp=@xmath266 , actually found in the simulations , whereas in the second case the tcp lies below the observed cp .",
    "it is important to note the approximations and assumptions we are making in using eqs .",

    "we do not know these precise values , however , so we make simple estimates of their magnitudes and then see how sensitive the tcp @xmath268 and @xmath127 that come out of ( [ eqn : eqno39a ] ) , ( [ eqn : eqno39b ] ) , and ( [ eqn : eqno40 ] ) are to slight changes in @xmath254 .",
    "we find great sensitivity , which suggests that the tcp location is very sensitive to the interaction parameters upon which the @xmath267 and @xmath248 depend .",
    "whether a similar sensitivity of the cp location upon these parameter values exists is an important question that we can not probe on the basis of our results here but which is deserving of further work .",
    "such a sensitivity might help explain the remarkable disparities that different groups@xcite have found in the cp location in @xmath261 samples .",
    "an even more dramatic possibility is raised by the observation that comes out of our work that depending on the details of the short - range interactions in an ionic system one might have both a cp and a tcp [ as in fig .",
    "3 ] or only one of these occuring in stable equilibrium , with the other describing metastable criticality that lies within the coexistence region defined by the stable singular point [ as in fig . 4 ] .",
