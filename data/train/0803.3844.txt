    "the five - minute solar oscillations were discovered by leighton , noyes and simon@xcite and interpreted as deep standing acoustic waves by ulrich.@xcite improved observations by deubner@xcite confirmed that power is concentrated along discrete ridges in wavenumber - frequency space , as predicted by ulrich s theory .",
    "the source of excitation of solar oscillations is known to be near - surface turbulent convection.@xcite standard texts on solar and stellar oscillations are listed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite .    the fundamental data of modern helioseismology are doppler images of the line - of - sight component of velocity , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is time and @xmath2 is a position vector on the sun s surface .",
    "the two main datasets are provided by the global oscillation network group ( gong , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and by the michelson doppler imager ( mdi , ref .",
    "@xcite ) aboard the esa / nasa soho spacecraft in a halo orbit around the l1 sun - earth lagrange point since 1996 .",
    "the mdi dopplergrams are obtained by combining four filtergrams in the wings and core of the ni 6788   absorption line , formed just above the photosphere ; images are recorded on a 1024@xmath31024 pixel ccd camera at the cadence of one per minute .",
    "the data are best studied in wavenumber - frequency space . under the assumption that the sun s surface is locally plane",
    ", we can extract the harmonic components of the signal by application of a 3d fourier transform : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a local area on the sun , @xmath6 is the horizontal wavevector , and @xmath7 is the angular frequency .",
    "we adopt the convention that the @xmath8 coordinate points prograde , toward the west limb , while @xmath9 points toward the north pole .",
    "figure  [ fig.power ] shows a cut at @xmath10 through the power spectrum @xmath11 obtained from a time series of mdi doppler images .",
    "images were previously shifted in space to remove the main component of solar rotation .",
    "power is distributed along distinct ridges labeled by an integer @xmath12 , known as the radial order , which corresponds to the number of nodes of the wave eigenfunctions counted in the radial direction ( from the surface to the center of the sun ) .",
    "the lowest frequency ridge with @xmath13 corresponds to the fundamental ( f ) modes of solar oscillations .",
    "the f modes are identified as surface gravity waves , with nearly the dispersion relation for deep water waves , @xmath14 , where @xmath15  ms@xmath16 is the gravitational acceleration at the sun s surface and @xmath17 is the horizontal wavenumber .",
    "the f modes propagate horizontally .",
    "all other ridges , denoted by p@xmath18 , correspond to acoustic modes , or p modes .",
    "the restoring force for p modes is pressure .",
    "the ridge immediately above the f mode ridge is p@xmath19 , the next one p@xmath20 , and so forth .",
    "we may denote by @xmath21 the dispersion relation associated with the @xmath12th ridge of power .",
    "modes with smaller values of @xmath17 and larger @xmath12 penetrate deeper inside the sun .",
    "an essential physical property of acoustic waves is that modes with similar values of the horizontal phase speed @xmath22 propagate to similar depths inside the sun . for frequencies above the acoustic cutoff frequency ( @xmath23  mhz , dashed line )",
    ", acoustic waves are not trapped inside the sun but propagate freely outward .",
    "we note that for @xmath24 , where @xmath25  mm is the solar radius , it is not correct to assume a plane parallel geometry : spherical harmonics transforms should be implemented instead of spatial fourier transforms , as is done in global mode helioseismology.@xcite    the theory of solar oscillations has been discussed at length elsewhere .",
    "in local helioseismology , it is important to consider wave propagation through generic solar models , including models with local inhomogeneities . in this paragraph and for the sake of simplicity only , we assume that no steady background flow is present .",
    "solar oscillations are described by the displacement vector @xmath26 of a fluid parcel that would have been at location @xmath27 and time @xmath1 had there been no wave motion .",
    "all physical quantities ( e.g. density ) are expanded into a steady background value ( e.g. @xmath28 ) and a wave perturbation ( denoted with a prime , e.g. @xmath29 ) . in the case of small - amplitude oscillations , which is a good approximation , only first order perturbations are retained .",
    "the continuity equation reads @xmath30 ignoring the perturbation to the gravitational potential ( cowling approximation ) , the momentum equation is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the pressure perturbation and @xmath33 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "we note that if the background model includes a magnetic field @xmath34 then the perturbation to the lorentz force , @xmath35 = ( { \\mbox{{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}}}\\times\\bb)\\times\\bb'/4\\pi + ( { \\mbox{{\\boldmath$\\nabla$}}}\\times\\bb')\\times\\bb/4\\pi$ ] , must be added to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq.momentum ] ) . for the energy equation ,",
    "we assume adiabatic wave motion ( no heat losses ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the first adiabatic exponent and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lagrangian perturbations in pressure and density respectively .",
    "combining the above equations , we obtain a single differential equation for @xmath40 : @xmath41 had we considered a medium with a background flow , @xmath42 , then the time derivative @xmath43 in the above equation would have been replaced by @xmath44 , as explained in ref .",
    "we note that , in the upper layers of the sun , the term @xmath45 can usually be dropped because variations in @xmath46 are slow there .",
    "the point of the previous paragraph was to show that it is feasible to write down a differential operator , @xmath47 , that controls the evolution of the fluid displacement associated with free , small - amplitude oscillations of the sun .",
    "our model , however , is incomplete as it ignores the excitation and damping of oscillations by turbulent convection , a difficult problem .",
    "it is customary to add a source term , @xmath48 , to the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq.comb ] ) , @xmath49   = \\bs(\\br , t ) , \\label{eq.main}\\ ] ] and to tune @xmath48 empirically to obtain an approximate match between the model and observed power spectra.@xcite at the same time , a simplified damping term is also added to @xmath47 to reproduce the linewidths of the modes in the power spectrum.@xcite the function @xmath48 should be understood as the realization of a random process .    by definition ,",
    "the observable is the line - of - sight component of velocity at the solar surface : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a unit vector that points toward the observer and @xmath52 denotes the convolution of the signal by the point spread function of the telescope .",
    "local helioseismology is a set of tools to make three dimensional images of the solar interior",
    ". the most popular methods of analysis are time - distance helioseismology , ring - diagram analysis , fourier - hankel decomposition , seismic holography , and direct modeling ( see ref .  @xcite for a general review ) . here",
    "i shall only explain the basic principle of time - distance and ring - diagram analyses .",
    "time - distance helioseismology@xcite consists of measuring the travel times of wave packets propagating through the solar interior between any two points on the solar surface .",
    "the travel times between locations @xmath53 and @xmath54 are extracted from the cross - covariance function @xmath55 the cross - covariance function is a phase - coherent average of the random oscillations : it can be seen as a solar seismogram .",
    "the travel time @xmath56 for waves moving from @xmath53 to @xmath54 is measured by fitting @xmath57 with a gaussian wavelet .",
    "a travel time anomaly contains the seismic signature of buried inhomogeneities within the proximity of the ray path that connects the two surface locations .",
    "flows in the sun break the symmetry between @xmath58 and @xmath59 , while sound speed perturbations affect the mean travel time .",
    "an inverse problem must be solved to infer the 3d structure and dynamics of the solar interior .",
    "ring - diagram analysis@xcite consists of studying local power spectra of solar oscillations , @xmath60 , computed over small patches of the solar surface around a location @xmath2 ( unlike the power spectrum of figure  [ fig.power ] , which was computed over a large fraction of the solar disk ) .",
    "the frequencies of the modes of solar oscillations are carefully measured from any given local power spectrum .",
    "the small differences between the measured mode frequencies and the theoretical frequencies from a reference solar model provides information about the solar interior in the vicinity of @xmath2 .",
    "ring - diagram analysis has been particularly successful at mapping horizontal flows in the upper convection zone .",
    "the effect of a slowly - varying horizontal flow @xmath42 is to doppler shift the power spectrum by an amount @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the reference power spectrum with @xmath64 . in practice , for a general flow @xmath65 that varies with depth , the doppler shift will depend on the radial order .",
    "once again , an inverse problem must be solved to infer the variation of solar properties with position in the solar interior .    in order to do linear inversions of helioseismic data ,",
    "it is necessary to first solve the linear forward problem .",
    "the linear forward problem is to compute the first - order effect ( prefix @xmath66 ) of small perturbations to a reference solar model ( subscript @xmath67 ) .",
    "the zero - order reference solar model is usually invariant by horizontal translation , has zero mean flow , and no magnetic field . in general",
    ", the linear forward problem can be written as @xmath68 in this equation , @xmath69 denotes the value of a particular seismic parameter ( travel time , ring fit parameter , etc ... ) minus the value of this parameter in the reference solar model .",
    "the sum over the index @xmath70 is a sum over all possible types of physical quantities @xmath71 ( sound speed , density , flows , etc ... ) .",
    "the kernel function @xmath72 gives the sensitivity of @xmath73 to the perturbation @xmath74 at position @xmath27 in the solar interior .",
    "so far , essentially all studies assume that the perturbations to the solar model , @xmath75 , are time - independent over the time duration during which the observations are made .    the main step involved in the derivation of the kernels",
    "@xmath76 is the calculation of the first order perturbation to the wave displacement , @xmath77 .",
    "the change in the solar model , through the @xmath75 , are included in the perturbed wave operator , @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath75 may also imply a change in the source function , @xmath79 .",
    "for example , a magnetic field or a flow may affect the small - scale convection that drives the solar oscillations .",
    "the calculation of @xmath80 , according the first - order born approximation , @xmath81 = - \\delta{\\cal l } [ { \\mbox{{\\boldmath$\\xi$}}}_0 ] + \\delta \\bs , \\label{eq.born}\\ ] ] is developed in full detail in refs .",
    "equation  ( [ eq.born ] ) shows that the born approximation is an equivalent - source description of wave interaction . an equally good alternative to the born approximation",
    "is the rytov approximation.@xcite    figure  [ fig.kernel ] shows a kernel function obtained by birch , kosovichev and duvall@xcite for the sensitivity of travel - time measurements ( @xmath82 ) to a local perturbation @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the sound speed .",
    "the kernel values are close to zero along the ray path ( infinite frequency limit ) , which led geophysics to refer to such kernels as banana - doughnut kernels.@xcite    the sensitivity of travel times extends much beyond the geometrical ray path that connects the two points at the surface .",
    "the central lobe of a sensitivity kernel is called the first fresnel zone : a scatterer placed on the boundary of the first fresnel zone causes a phase difference between the direct and scattered waves of @xmath85 . in the case of a uniform medium ,",
    "the width of the fresnel zone is approximately given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the dominant wavelength of the solar oscillations . to illustrate this point",
    ", we may take as a reference for @xmath87 the wavelength of an f mode near @xmath88  mhz : @xmath89 the width of the first fresnel zone does exceed the size of some of the solar convective structures that leave a signature in the travel - time measurements . to be more precise , finite - wavelength effects become very important when the wavelength of the underlying perturbations in the sun is less than @xmath90 .",
    "we note that finite - wavelength tomography has received a lot attention in geophysics in the last few years , in particular to resolve plumes in the earth s",
    "mantle.@xcite one of the differences between helio- and geo - seismology is that in the sun waves are excited stochastically over the whole solar surface , leading to more complex sensitivity kernels .",
    "the linear inverse problem of local helioseismology , which consists of inverting for the @xmath75 from a set of measurements @xmath69 , is relatively well understood .",
    "two standard methods are used : regularized least squares ( rls , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and optimally localized averaging ( ola , ref .",
    "the multi - channel deconvolution algorithm significantly speeds up rls inversions.@xcite in general , inversions must take into account the fact that the data errors are correlated.@xcite",
    "motions on the solar surface display two specific scales : granulation and supergranulation .",
    "granules , with a typical scale of @xmath91  mm , are well understood as a convective phenomenon thanks to realistic numerical simulations .",
    "supergranules , however , have remained puzzling since their discovery by leighton , noyes and simon:@xcite there is no accepted theory that explains why convection should favor a 30  mm scale .",
    "supergranular cells expel the magnetic flux from the regions of fluid motion and concentrate it into ropes at the cell boundaries to form the quiet sun magnetic network .",
    "the simplest way to detect supergranulation with time - distance helioseismology is to measure , with a cross - correlation technique , the time it takes for solar waves to propagate between any given point on the solar surface and a concentric annulus around that point .",
    "the difference in travel times between inward and outward propagating waves is a measure of the local divergence of the flow.@xcite in the case of surface - gravity waves ( f modes ) , the travel - time difference is directly sensitive to the horizontal divergence of the flow velocity in the top 2  mm below the surface , without inversion.@xcite figure  [ fig.oi ] shows the divergence signal ( inward minus outward travel times ) obtained by analyzing a 12-hr long time series of mdi full - disk doppler velocity images tracked at the carrington rate to remove the main component of solar rotation .",
    "a white , or positive signal , corresponds to a horizontal outflow . from the size of the features present and their locations with respect to the magnetic network ,",
    "supergranulation is identified as the main contribution to the signal .",
    "compared to the doppler line - of - sight velocity , the main advantage of the helioseismic divergence signal is that it is essentially free of systematic variations across the field of view , which is an important condition to study the evolution of the pattern .",
    "divergence maps can also be constructed with a technique known as seismic holography.@xcite    the evolution of the pattern of convection has been studied using long sequences ( two to three months each year ) of divergence maps , like the one shown in figure  [ fig.oi ] .",
    "each map covers a region of size @xmath92 centered on the solar disk .",
    "this means that a feature co - rotating with the sun can be observed continuously for about @xmath93  days .",
    "such long time series enabled gizon , duvall and schou@xcite to resolve unexpected oscillations in the 3d fourier spectrum of the divergence signal ( with frequencies in the range @xmath94-@xmath95  @xmath96hz ) and excess power in the prograde direction .",
    "these wave - like properties have not been explained yet , although an interesting analysis by green and kosovichev@xcite suggests that convection in a vertical shear flow could take the form of traveling waves . from the autocorrelation of the divergence signal",
    ", the lifetime of supergranulation is measured to be about @xmath95  days .",
    "in addition to the horizontal divergence , @xmath97 , it is also possible to measure separately the two horizontal components of the vector flow ( by splitting the annulus into quadrants ) , from which an estimate of the vertical vorticity , @xmath98 , can be derived . after removing the large - scale vorticity@xcite due to differential rotation and meridional circulation ,",
    "a small correlation between div and curl is detected,@xcite which is found to be proportional to @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the angular velocity of the sun at latitude @xmath87 .",
    "this latitudinal variation of the correlation is precisely what is expected of the effect of the coriolis force on convection . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "supergranular cells rotate preferentially clockwise where the horizontal divergence is positive , while they rotate preferentially counterclockwise in the convergent flows near the sinks .",
    "the sense of circulation is reversed in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the coupling between convection and rotation is weak ( the correlation coefficient between div and curl is less than @xmath101 ) , in relatively good agreement with numerical simulations.@xcite    in addition , both time - distance helioseismology and ring diagram analysis have revealed the existence of long - lived flow patterns on scales that are much larger than supergranulation,@xcite which may be related to the largest scales of deep convection.@xcite",
    "thomas , cram and nye@xcite first suggested that solar oscillations could be used to probe the internal structure of sunspots .",
    "since then , observations have shown that the frequencies , phases , and amplitudes of solar oscillations are perturbed in regions of enhanced magnetic activity.@xcite sunspots are known to absorb incident p - mode energy@xcite , introduce phase shifts between the incident and transmitted waves@xcite , and cause mode mixing.@xcite all these observations inform us about the conditions inside and in the immediate vicinity of sunspots : temperature and density anomalies , fluid motions , and the magnetic field.@xcite high - frequency acoustic waves can also be used to map the topography of the magnetic fields above sunspots , in the chrosmosphere.@xcite    figure  [ fig.dean ] shows results obtained by chou@xcite with acoustic imaging , a technique used to reconstruct the seismic signal at any target point on the solar surface .",
    "the reconstructed signal contains information about the amplitude and the phase of wave packets converging toward the target point or diverging from that point .",
    "active regions introduce local changes easily detectable in the maps of the reconstructed outgoing intensity .",
    "waves are absorbed by active regions as evidenced by the deficit of outgoing acoustic intensity . in this example",
    ", the active region also introduces phase - time shifts as big as @xmath91  min , i.e. a significant fraction of the wave oscillation period .",
    "the forward and inverse problems of sunspot seismology present many challenging issues .",
    "the main difficulties are nonlinear aspects of wave propagation , radiative transfer in magnetized plasmas , and the relationship between velocity measurements in sunspots and real fluid motions .",
    "the complexity of the problem is evident from numerical studies of the propagation of p and f modes through model sunspots and their coupling to magnetic waves@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that magnetic perturbations are not small near the solar surface:@xcite the first born approximation can not be applied there . only deeper inside the sun ,",
    "can magnetic effects be treated as small perturbations.@xcite    a number of simplifications have been made to interpret the observations and obtain approximate answers .",
    "the first assumption which is commonly used is that structural perturbations inside sunspots are small ( not quite correct , as mentioned just above ) .",
    "in addition , it is often assumed that the travel - time shifts , scattering phase shifts , or local mode frequency shifts are caused by sound speed perturbations ( indirect effect of the magnetic field ) . under these simplifying assumptions ,",
    "a linear inverse problem can be solved to infer subsurface sound - speed perturbations.@xcite one of the latest inversions by kosovichev@xcite using high - resolution mdi - soho data , is shown in figure  [ fig.koso ] .",
    "it is found that the sound speed is lower just below the sunspots ( probably indicating a lower temperature ) , while the sound speed is higher at depths greater than about 4  mm .",
    "deeper than about @xmath102  mm , the seismic signature of sunspots fades away .",
    "these findings indicate that sunspots are rather shallow and that the emerged magnetic flux is somehow disconnected from its root in the deep convection zone.@xcite figure  [ fig.koso ] , a vertical cut through a pair of sunspots with opposite polarities , reveals a very interesting loop - like structure , which may tell us something about the underlying magnetic topology .",
    "efforts are under way to infer other quantities than the sound speed below sunspots .",
    "basu , antia and bogart@xcite performed a depth inversion of local frequency shifts simultaneously for the sound speed and the adiabatic exponent .",
    "a major goal is to directly image the magnetic field .",
    "this has not been accomplished yet as it is not easy to separate unambiguously magnetic perturbations from other perturbations , such as temperature or density anomalies .",
    "piercing through the surface will require that we know how to correct for the strong phase shifts introduced by the surface density drop ( wilson depression ) and the surface magnetic field.@xcite ultimately , non - linear inversions of seismic measurements may be necessary .",
    "a first attempt is due to crouch et al.@xcite using a genetic algorithm to adjust the parameters that control the radial structure of sunspot models .",
    "a major improvement in our understanding of wave propagation through strongly magnetized regions is expected from realistic numerical simulations .",
    "outside active regions , in the quiet sun , the photosphere magnetic fields appear to be clumped into intense flux tubes with typical field strength of order @xmath94  kg and diameters of about @xmath103  km .",
    "it is well known that flux tubes support various modes of oscillation : the alfvn modes ( twisting motion ) , the sausage modes ( propagating change in the cross - section of the tube ) , and the kink modes ( bending of the tube ) . the interaction of acoustic waves with thin flux tubes , i.e. tubes with diameters much less than the wavelengths , has been studied extensively . in particular , it is believed@xcite that scattering of acoustic waves by flux tubes contributes to the observed@xcite damping rates and frequency shifts .",
    "local helioseismology has the potential to provide observational tests for some of these ideas . a promising approach , pioneered by duvall",
    ", birch and gizon,@xcite is to study small magnetic features averaged over 4  hr time intervals . compared to sunspots , magnetic network elements",
    "have the advantage of being relatively simple magnetic configurations .",
    "in addition , they are so many that a statistical treatment is possible .",
    "it was observed that the decrease in f - mode travel time caused by an average magnetic feature is @xmath95  s@xmath104kg@xmath105 at most .",
    "it is hoped that such data will help us understand wave scattering by slender vertical flux tubes .",
    "a distinction should be made between flows in the immediate vicinity of sunspots , and small - amplitude , extended flows around large active regions .",
    "duvall et al.@xcite discovered travel - time shifts in sunspots that are consistent with strong , 1  km@xmath104s@xmath105 downflows , several  mm below the surface . near the surface ,",
    "a 500  m@xmath104s@xmath105 horizontal outflow from the center of sunspots , known as the moat flow , is observed.@xcite zhao , kosovichev and duvall@xcite discovered mass motions across a sunspot at a depth of about @xmath106  mm , as well as a collar flow , which may stabilize the sunspot.@xcite    on a much larger spatial scale ( tens of heliographic degrees ) , long time averages of surface flow maps reveal weak , @xmath107  m@xmath104s@xmath105 horizontal flows that converge toward large complexes of magnetic activity.@xcite such a surface inflow may have its origin in the decrease of gas pressure in magnetized regions.@xcite deeper inside the sun ( @xmath106  mm below the surface ) , inversions point to the existence of @xmath107  m@xmath104s@xmath105 horizontal flows diverging away from active regions,@xcite suggesting the existence of an extended toroidal cell.@xcite using a mass conservation constraint , komm et al.@xcite derived the vertical component of velocity and the kinetic helicity density , which take the largest values in active regions .",
    "local helioseismology has also been particularly successful at measuring global - scale motions in the sun : rotation and meridional circulation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the localized , organized motions around active regions that have just been described introduce an 11-yr solar - cycle variation in the longitudinal average of the meridional circulation , which could affect the large - scale transport of the surface magnetic flux .",
    "lindsey and braun@xcite demonstrated that acoustic waves observed on the front side ( earth side ) of the sun can be used to image large active regions on the far side of the sun .",
    "farside helioseismic imaging , a special case of phase - sensitive holography , uses long - wavelength internal acoustic waves that leave the front side , bounce once off the surface , then bounce from a target location ( on the farside ) , and bounce again on the way returning to the front side where we can observe them again .",
    "this 2 + 2 skip geometry ( figure  [ fig.farside ] ) is designed to map regions not too distant from the antipode of the center of the visible disk .",
    "active regions on the farside introduce travel - time shifts of the order of ten seconds with respect to the quiet sun . for focus positions closer to the limb , braun and lindsey@xcite proposed to use a 1 + 3 skip geometry . by combining the 2 + 2 and 1 + 3 skip geometries , oslund and scherrer ( 2006 ) produced maps of the entire farside ( see figure  [ fig.farside ] ) .",
    "obviously , farside imaging has important implications for space weather predictions .",
    "this short overview of the methods and results of helioseismic tomography will hopefully convince the reader of the richness of this exciting field of research .",
    "local helioseismology has revealed unexpected aspects of the dynamics of supergranulation , wave - speed anomalies and complex flow patterns below sunspots and active regions , and magnetic activity on the farside of the sun .",
    "as mentioned throughout this text , many challenging issues will have to be addressed before these discoveries can be fully be trusted .",
    "future progress is likely to come from improved models of the interaction of seismic waves with subsurface inhomogeneities and validation through realistic numerical simulations . on the observational side ,",
    "the next technological steps are nasa s solar dynamics observatory to be launched in 2008 ( improved spatial resolution ) and the solar orbiter mission of esa scheduled for 2015 ( out of the ecliptic views of the polar regions of the sun ) .",
