    "the wealth of observational evidence suggests that outflows from low - mass protostars are almost certainly powered by disk accretion where magnetic stresses control the balance between inflow and outflow and determine the outflow structure far from the protostar .",
    "intermediate mass protostars , up to early b stars , can probably also be described by this general picture however the details are not as clear .",
    "the presence of accretion disks and outflows traced to within 50100  au of early b protostars suggests that they are also likely formed via accretion ( e.g. , shepherd 2003 , chini et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the structure and kinematics of circumstellar material around early b protostars directly affects the formation and evolution of the central object(s ) .",
    "circumstellar disks provide a reservoir of material that can transport angular momentum away from the central object in two possible ways : 1 ) disks create outflows which transport angular momentum ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "2000 ; ouyed & pudritz 1999 ) ; and 2 ) if @xmath8 the disk may be locally unstable and provide an additional means of transporting angular momentum away from the protostar ( e.g. , laughlin & bodenheimer 1994 ; yorke , bodenheimer , & laughlin 1995 ; shepherd , claussen , & kurtz 2001 , hereafter sck01 ) .",
    "massive star formation tends to occur in compact clusters and it can be difficult to separate individual outflows from each other ( e.g. , beuther , schilke , & stanke 2003 ; beuther & schilke 2004 ) .",
    "even when a single , early b protostar dominates the flow dynamics in a cluster , companions or close members of a cluster can interact with an accretion disk causing it to precess or be truncated ( e.g. , fendt & zinnecker 1998 and references therein ; shepherd et al .",
    "the strong radiation field from massive protostars and cluster members can also significantly affect the cluster and disk evolution ( e.g. , knigl 1999 ; yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ) .    understanding the interactions between cluster members , dense gas , and the radiation field is important to be able to unravel the processes that affect the formation and evolution of massive star forming regions .",
    "one early b protostar that may shed some light on this issue is g192.163.84 ( hereafter g192.16 , also known as iras 05553 + 1631 ) .",
    "g192.16 is the most massive object in a protostellar cluster at a distance of 2kpc .",
    "an ultracompact ( uc )  region with luminosity @xmath9 l@xmath10 implies the presence of an early b star with a mass of 8 to 10 m ( hughes & macleod 1993 ; sck01 ) .",
    "the detection of ( 1,1 ) ( molinari et al . 1996 ) , strong 22 ghz maser emission ( codella , felli , & natale 1996 ) , and 1 & 3 mm continuum emission ( shepherd et al .",
    "1998 ; beuther et al .",
    "2002 ) also suggests that this is a site of recent star formation .",
    "g192.16 is at the center of a 100 m molecular outflow with mass outflow rate @xmath11myr@xmath12 and dynamical age @xmath13 years ( snell , dickman , & huang 1990 ; shepherd et al .",
    "1998 , devine et al . 1999 ) .",
    "recent 2.1@xmath0 m observations detect a very red object near the position of the radio - detected uc  region .",
    "if the 2.1@xmath0 m source is a direct detection of g192.16 , then the protostellar photosphere is extincted by @xmath14 magnitudes ( indebetouw et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "based on 22.2ghz maser and centimeter continuum observations , shepherd & kurtz ( 1999 ) proposed that the g192.16 massive young stellar object ( yso ) is surrounded by a 1000au rotating , molecular torus .",
    "the size of this molecular torus or possible disk is smaller than the handful of structures detected around other early b protostars .",
    "for example , iras20126 + 4104 appears to have a 1700au flattened , rotating torus detected in ch@xmath15cn ( cesaroni et al .",
    "1999 ) and a similar sized structure is detected in emission around afgl 5142 ( zhang et al .",
    "it is unclear whether the circumstellar material detected in these dense core tracers are flattened , rotating cores , tori , or large disks .",
    "significantly larger circumstellar structures are also observed : a protostar in m17 appears to have a torus or flared disk of diameter 20,000au as mapped with near - infrared imaging ( chini et al .",
    "2004 ) ; and flattened , rotating molecular cores are inferred from high density tracers such as h@xmath16cn ( ngc 7538s ; sandell , wright , & forster 2003 ) and ( iras20126 + 4104 ; zhang , hunter & sridharan 1998 ) .",
    "approximately 1  north of g192.16 , masers are also detected along a strip of ionized gas with a negative spectral index implying the presence of a mixed synchrotron and thermal emission jet ( shepherd & kurtz 1999 ) .",
    "the driving source for this collimated jet has not been detected .",
    "continuum observations at 7 mm by sck01 with a resolution of @xmath17mas did not detect the 1000au torus predicted by shepherd & kurtz ( 1999 ) . instead , compact warm dust emission was detected within 50mas of the massive yso .",
    "a model fit to the 7 mm continuum emission suggested an 8 central protostar ( g192s1 ) with a possible protostellar companion ( g192s2 ) , a 130 au diameter disk with a mass of 3 - 20 , and an outflow with @xmath18 degree opening angle .",
    "the non - detection of emission from the the 1000au torus by sck01 could be the result of resolving out the torus with the 7 mm observations or the dust temperature could be too low to emit significantly in 7 mm continuum .",
    "recent observations at 450 and 850@xmath0 m ( at resolution @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively ) show that there is extended warm dust emission centered on g192.16 ( williams , fuller , & sridharan 2004 ) .",
    "the far - infrared emission is centrally peaked and corresponds to a gas+dust mass of roughly 26 to 64 ( williams et al .",
    "assumed a kinematic distance of 2.5kpc ; at a distance of 2kpc the mass would be 16 to 40 ) .    in an effort to understand the cluster and circumstellar environment of g192.16 , we present observations of ( 1,1 ) tracing dense gas and masers near the massive protostar , along with archive data of 850@xmath0 m continuum emission",
    "observations of ( 1,1 ) line emission at 23.694ghz were made with the national radio astronomy observatory s very large array ( vla ) in `` d '' configuration .",
    "baselines between 35  m and 1.03  km could detect a largest angular emission scale , @xmath21 .",
    "the estimated uncertainty of the flux calibration is @xmath22% .",
    "calibration and imaging was performed using the aips@xmath23 data reduction package .",
    "the continuum emission was subtracted in the @xmath24 plane .",
    "the line - only emission was imaged using briggs robust @xmath24 weighting and deconvolved with clean .",
    "continuum - only emission was recovered and imaged separately using natural @xmath24 weighting and clean deconvolution .",
    "observations of masers at 22.235ghz were made with the vla in `` b '' configuration .",
    "calibration and imaging was performed using the aips data reduction package .",
    "the data were imaged using natural @xmath24 weighting and clean deconvolution .",
    "a summary of the vla observations is given in table 1 .",
    ".vla observation summary [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath25  average density assuming a uniform sphere .",
    "another method to estimate the cloud stability is to calculate the jeans mass ( the minimum mass for which a cloud will be bound ) .",
    "the jeans mass is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the jeans length , @xmath28 which we take to be the measured radius of the cloud , @xmath29 . to estimate the mass density , @xmath30 , we assume a uniform spherical distribution .",
    "this is clearly not a realistic assumption however the values derived for the number density , @xmath31 , based on this assumption ( table 4 ) are within a factor of two of the number density calculated based on emission ( table 3 ) .",
    "thus , we assume @xmath30 probably is good to within a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "the resulting jeans mass is given in table 4 .",
    "@xmath32 is unity for the gas around g192.16 suggesting that is on the verge of stability while the ratio is 9 for g192s3 , consistent with the interpretation that the cloud has adequate mass to collapse under its own gravitational potential .    despite the compact nature of g192s3 and indications that it may be gravitationally unstable ,",
    "no free - free continuum emission from ionized gas has been detected at centimeter wavelengths , no maser emission has been detected , and no high - velocity molecular gas has been traced to the core which would indicate the presence of a molecular outflow .",
    "the detection of 850@xmath0 m emission toward g192s3 is consistent with the presence of a warm ( @xmath33k ) , dense molecular core that could be heated by gravitational collapse or an embedded protostar .",
    "diffuse 21@xmath0 m emission is located up to about @xmath34 south of g192.16 in images from the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) .",
    "the emission is at a level of @xmath35 and there is no strong peak corresponding with g192s3 .",
    "the msx did not detect emission near g192s3 at 12 & 14.6@xmath0 m .",
    "g192s3 has been detected in 1.2 mm continuum emission suggesting that dust is being heated by an embedded source ( beuther et al .",
    "figure 8 presents data from beuther et al . toward g192.16 ( 05553 + 1631 ) .",
    "contours have been chosen to illustrate that the g192s3 source is detected at a level of @xmath36 and is clearly separated from g192.16 .",
    "the peak emission at the location of g192s3 is @xmath37 in an @xmath38 beam . following the method of hildebrand ( 1983 ) ,",
    "the mass of gas and dust is estimated from the 1.2 mm continuum emission using @xmath39 where d is the distance to the source , @xmath40 is the continuum flux density due to thermal dust emission at frequency @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is the planck function at temperature t@xmath43 .",
    "we take @xmath44  @xmath45  g@xmath12 ( kramer et al . 1998 ; shepherd & watson 2002 ) .",
    "the opacity index @xmath46 appears to be appropriate between wavelengths of 650  microns and 2.7  mm for sub - micron to millimeter - sized grains expected in warm molecular clouds and young disks ( pollack et al .",
    "we assume the dust emission is optically thin , the temperature of the dust can be characterized by a single value , and the gas - to - dust ratio is 100 .",
    "using values of @xmath47  k and @xmath46 , we find the mass of gas and dust associated with the 1.2 mm continuum emission peak of g192s3 is approximately 4  m. this value should be considered an upper limit since the g192s3 peak flux density is probably contaminated by the bright , extended emission from the early b protostar , g192.16 .",
    "never - the - less , this value is within a factor of a few of estimates based on and 850@xmath0 m emission .",
    "additional 1.2 mm emission is also detected nearly an arcminute to the se of the g192.16 protostar .",
    "this is consistent with the presence of 21@xmath0 m and 850@xmath0 m emission along a ridge to the se of g192.16 , within which g192s3 appears to be embedded .",
    "we can compare the properties of g192s3 with the well - studied pre - stellar core l1544 in the taurus molecular cloud ( d = 140pc ) that appears to be on the verge of gravitational instability ( e.g. , tafalla et al .",
    "1998 ; cioleck & basu 2000 ; caselli et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ) .",
    "the l1544 core has a strong 1.3 mm continuum source with a flux density of 2.3jy ( 90 peak with a @xmath48 beam or 225 with a @xmath49 beam ) corresponding to a gas+dust mass of 3.2 with a density of @xmath50@xmath51 ( ward - thompson , motte , & andre 1999 ; caselli et al .",
    "the n@xmath52h@xmath53 line width is @xmath54 .",
    "based on models of the chemical evolution in molecular cores , bergin & langer ( 1997 ) find that and n@xmath52h@xmath53 show little depletion in the central , high - density environment of a pre - protostellar core because of the low binding energy of nitrogen .",
    "thus , both make excellent tracers of very dense regions where depletion is occurring and are expected to have similar line widths .",
    "indeed , observations toward several low - mass starless cores in and n@xmath52h@xmath53 show similar line widths ( @xmath55 ) for both molecules ( tafalla et al .",
    "2004 ) . assuming and n@xmath52h@xmath53 trace the same regions , one would then expect a similar line width in as seen in n@xmath52h@xmath53 , e.g. , @xmath54 for l1544 .",
    "although the mass of warm gas and dust in both l1544 and g192s3 is similar ( a few ) , g192s3 has an line width that is more than double that expected in l1544 while the number density is a factor of 10 lower .",
    "massive star formation regions are often dynamically active , producing inherently broad line profiles because of large velocity dispersions . despite the increased line width",
    ", g192s3 still appears to be gravitationally unstable and may be in the process of collapse .",
    "could g192s3 harbor an l1544-like millimeter continuum peak and not be detected at 2.7 mm ?",
    "shepherd et al . ( 1998 ) observed the region in which g192s3 is located at 112ghz with @xmath56 resolution and obtained an rms of 2.1 . scaling the 240ghz l1544 emission to 112.3ghz at a distance of 2kpc ( @xmath57 ) , and assuming that roughly 40% of the flux density would be recovered in the @xmath58 beam",
    ", we would expect a peak flux density of about 1  below the @xmath59 rms level in the map .",
    "thus , g192s3 could contain a millimeter continuum peak like that seen in the low - mass core l1544 and not be detected at 2.7 mm . on the other hand , the peak flux density in 1.2 mm continuum emission expected from l1544 at a distance of 2kpc is 10 in an @xmath38 beam .",
    "beuther et al .",
    "detect a peak flux density of about 70 toward g192s3 .",
    "thus , it appears that the embedded source in g192s3 is probably somewhat more luminous than l1544 .",
    "this brief comparison illustrates that g192s3 is not likely to harbor a massive protostar .",
    "the properties are similar to those expected for low - mass pre - stellar or protostellar cores .",
    "follow - up , sensitive millimeter continuum observations are necessary to verify this interpretation . in addition , n@xmath52h@xmath53 and hco@xmath53 observations could provide clues as to the evolutionary stage of the cloud collapse ( e.g. , lee et al .",
    "we have observed the massive star forming region associated with g192.163.84 in ( 1,1 ) , masers , and 1.3 cm continuum emission , and obtained archive data at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "the dense gas associated with g192.16 is clumpy , optically thin , and has a mass of less than 1 .",
    "the molecular core appears to be in the process of being dispersed , perhaps by the molecular outflow and stellar winds from g192.16 .",
    "south of g192.16 is a compact , optically thick core ( g192s3 ) with a mass of 2.6 .",
    "the dense gas is likely to be gravitationally bound and may be the next site of star formation in this region .",
    "based on the presence of 850@xmath0 m and 1.2 mm continuum emission , g192s3 may harbor a very young , low - mass protostar .",
    "water masers trace an ionized jet @xmath1 north of g192.16 .",
    "masers are also located within 500au of g192.16 , their velocity distribution is consistent with the interpretation that the maser emission arises in a rotating disk however the current observations do not shed significant light on this issue .",
