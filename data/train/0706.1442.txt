    "for several years , neutrinos are considered to be massive particles @xcite , and therefore the orthodox standard model ( sm ) with massless neutrinos must be extended .",
    "there exist two possibilities .",
    "firstly , the extension of the sm can appear only at a very high energy scale , the gut / planck scale , and the non - zero neutrino masses are just the visible indication of such `` high energy '' physics in our `` low energy '' world . such scenario is usually called the new standard model ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "secondly , some new physics ( np ) can already be present at the @xmath8 scale , that means at energies close to our present - day experimental facilities .",
    "the second of these possibilities is more appealing from both , the experimental , and the theoretical points of view .",
    "such a `` low energy '' np can participate in neutrino flavor transitions , and so it could possibly be measured in future neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "then everything is in the hands of the precision of the planned experiments .",
    "the bounds on the np parameters , which arise from todays experiments , are too restrictive to give any good chance to see any effects in the present neutrino flavor transition data , taking into account the fact that the present precision in determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters ( of about @xmath9 @xcite ) effectively screens off any possible presence of np .",
    "however , the combined expected results from future neutrino facilities , like @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath6 , should bring the neutrino oscillation parameter errors down to about @xmath12@xmath13 @xcite and therefore give a chance for a discovery of effects , which possibly could not be explained by the `` present physics '' .",
    "the potential of the np discovery is considered in this paper .",
    "there are many ways in which np can modify neutrino oscillations .",
    "the non - standard effects can directly change oscillation probabilities ( the so called `` damping signatures '' @xcite ) , or they can modify the oscillation amplitudes ( by non - standard hamiltonian effects @xcite@xcite ) , where both , oscillations in vacuum , and in matter can be affected .",
    "these possibilities have extensively been examined in the existing literature .",
    "thus , there are models with sterile @xcite or / and heavy @xcite neutrinos , general models with lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) @xcite , non - standard interactions @xcite , flavor changing neutral currents @xcite , general fermion interactions @xcite and mass varying neutrinos @xcite .",
    "next , there are models with non - unitary leptonic mixing @xcite , violation of the lorentz symmetry @xcite , violation of the principle of general relativity @xcite and violation of the cpt symmetry @xcite .",
    "finally , there are models which modify neutrino oscillations , i.e.  models with neutrino wave packet decoherence @xcite , neutrinos decays @xcite and neutrino quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we discuss one class of np only , which can be obtained by mixing of the low mass `` active '' neutrinos with heavy ones @xcite , or by any model with lfv @xcite , in both of which neutrinos interact with matter particles by the left - handed ( l - h ) charge and neutral currents only . in such models ,",
    "the effective mixing matrix is non - unitary , resulting in non - orthogonal neutrino production and detection states .",
    "this non - orthogonality by itself modifies neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "apart from this , the neutrino interactions with matter particles are non - standard and so the oscillation effects in matter are further modified as well .",
    "both these effects are here taken into account . additionally , in our numerical calculations , we assume both @xmath1 and @xmath0 errors of today s @xmath7 neutrino oscillation parameters , keeping their present central values ( see chapter  [ sec : sims ] ) .",
    "the flavor transition probabilities were calculated for two energy ranges and several baselines @xcite .",
    "two of these baselines , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , are called `` magic '' for future @xmath6 experiments , as they are especially useful for cp violation discovery ( @xmath4 ) @xcite or optimal for resolving the oscillation parameters degeneracy problem ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we have performed our numerical calculations of flavor oscillation probabilities for all available channels for two sets of np parameters which describe a single `` effective '' heavy neutrino state , both satisfying present experimental constraints .",
    "one of the easiest channels , from the experimental point of view @xcite , is the @xmath14 one , but it will be difficult to observe any np there ( as it will also be in all another channels in which @xmath2 or @xmath3 are involved ) .",
    "in two other channels , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( and in the corresponding antineutrino channels ) , the effects of np are seen with the largest intensity , especially for the `` magic '' baselines mentioned above @xcite . in the next chapter we investigate how the np modifies @xmath7 oscillation transition probabilities .",
    "we discuss all leading terms , which give the new non - orthogonal production and detection states and which modify the neutrino coherent scattering on matter particles .",
    "we discuss also the reason why all channels with @xmath17 or @xmath18 as the initial and final neutrinos ( and the corresponding antineutrino channels ) , i.e.  all channels in which @xmath2 , @xmath3 are not involved at all , are the most desired ones .",
    "then , in chapter  [ sec : sims ] , we present the results of our numerical simulations . and",
    "finally , in chapter  [ sec : fruits ] , we give our conclusions . in the appendix  [ app : approx ]",
    "we collect all formulas for the flavor transition probabilities in constant density matter for all experimentally available channels .",
    "if one takes into account that only relativistic neutrinos are detected ( and that only vector left - handed interactions are considered ) , the detection rate @xmath19 of the @xmath20 neutrinos , coming from the produced @xmath21 neutrinos , factorizes into three parts , the production flux @xmath22 , the transition probability @xmath23 , and the detection cross section @xmath24:@xmath25 any physics beyond the @xmath7 will modify all of these three parts ( or even the above factorization will be made impossible ) . in this paper",
    ", we only discuss the modifications of the probability of neutrino flavor transition from a production state @xmath26 to a detection state @xmath27 , leaving the modifications of the production and detection neutrino cross sections for future detailed considerations .    in the frame of the @xmath7 ,",
    "the production or detection neutrino states are equal to the appropriate orthonormal neutrino flavor states @xmath28 .",
    "the np modifies this dependence and therefore the @xmath29 states are only approximately equal to the @xmath28 states .",
    "let us assume that the neutrinos are produced in the following process : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a charged lepton ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33,@xmath34 are hadrons .",
    "then the normalized neutrino production state @xmath35 can be defined as : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the amplitude for the process eq.([e21 ] ) , in which the neutrino eigenmass state @xmath38 is produced .",
    "the sum in eq.([e22 ] ) goes over all neutrinos with masses @xmath39 which are kinematically allowed . if particle spins were taken into account , instead of pure states of eq.([e22 ] )",
    ", we would have to use mixed states described by an appropriate density matrix .",
    "let us consider a np model , in which besides three light @xmath7 neutrinos there are also heavier ones , which couple to the light charged leptons in a non - negligible way @xcite . to be more precise , we assume the charge current lagrangian in the following form ( @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 and similarly the neutral current lagrangian in the following form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 the @xmath44 matrix @xmath45 defines the mixing between the flavor and mass states",
    "so , e.g. assuming three light and three heavy neutrinos we have : @xmath46 where all submatrices ( @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath49 and @xmath50 ) have dimensions @xmath51 . the three additional neutrino states , @xmath52,@xmath53 and @xmath54 , do not couple to charged leptons . for majorana",
    "neutrinos the submatrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which explicitly enter the interaction lagrangian eq.([e23 ] ) , depend on @xmath55 moduli and @xmath55 cp violating phases . for dirac neutrinos @xmath56 phases",
    "can be eliminated , giving altogether @xmath57 phases which , in principle , can enter the np neutrino flavor transition probabilities .",
    "if we assume that in the process given by eq.([e21 ] ) the energy conservation does not allow to produce heavy neutrinos @xmath58 then , according to eq.([e22 ] ) , the neutrino production state ( @xmath35 ) is given by : @xmath59 such states are normalized but not orthogonal .",
    "as the mixing of heavy neutrinos is small ( @xmath60 ) , the matrix @xmath47 is almost unitary .",
    "if we assume that a matrix @xmath61 describes a unitary transition and is parameterized by the standard @xmath62 mixing angles @xmath63 and @xmath12 standard dirac cp breaking phase @xmath64 , then the orthonormal neutrino flavor state @xmath28 is the following combination of neutrino mass states @xmath38 @xmath65 the @xmath47 matrix can be parameterized by a matrix @xmath66 close to the unit matrix @xmath67 : @xmath68 and therefore the production state @xmath35 in eq.([e22 ] ) is close to the eigenflavor state @xmath28 and can also be decomposed in the orthonormal flavor basis : @xmath69 where the @xmath70 parameters are equal to : @xmath71 in general case , the values of parameters @xmath72 depend on the production ( detection ) process @xcite , and are bounded by the existing charged lepton data .",
    "the same parametrization as in eq.([e210 ] ) was considered in @xcite , where the general lepton flavor violation np model is discussed . in each row of the @xmath70 matrix",
    ", practically only one element has a non - negligible value , namely : @xmath73 in general however , the @xmath51 matrix @xmath74 can have all non - vanishing elements .",
    "therefore , @xmath75 moduli and @xmath75 phases can generally parameterize any kind of np .",
    "not all phases play role in the transition probabilities .",
    "five majorana type phases do not enter any transition probability formula , hence only @xmath76 phases remain .    in the model considered here ,",
    "the elements of the @xmath74 matrix are connected with the heavy neutrino mixing matrix @xmath48 . from the unitary condition for the full @xmath45 matrix we get the following relation between @xmath66 and @xmath48 matrices : @xmath77 so ,",
    "neglecting the @xmath78 term , we have : @xmath79 or explicitly : @xmath80    note that , these are not explicit formulas for individual @xmath81 elements .",
    "however , terms in form of the left hand sides of eqs.([e215]),([e216 ] ) may often entirely describe the np effects for modified matter oscillations ( see eqs.([e218]),([e3022 ] ) below ) .",
    "if we need the knowledge of individual @xmath81 elements , for example in order to calculate the new production and detection neutrino state modifications , then they need to be calculated from eq.([e29 ] ) ( see eq.([e222 ] ) below and the appendix  [ app : approx ] ) .    up to now",
    "we have only considered the modifications of the initial and final neutrino states in the probability formula . such modifications will change the neutrino propagation even in vacuum . yet , if neutrinos pass matter additional effects arise .",
    "the coherent neutrino scattering on matter particles is modified by np and because of this : ( i )  neutrinos acquire different effective masses and ( ii )  their coherent scattering amplitude is modified .",
    "these effects can be parameterized by a np effective hamiltonian @xmath82 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the matrix representation of @xmath82 operator depends on the basis of states .",
    "generally , in the basis of states of produced and detected neutrinos , the @xmath82 operator is not represented by a hermitian matrix . however",
    ", it is represented by a hermitian matrix in the eigenmass basis ( @xmath38 ) and in any basis which is unitary transformed , e.g. in the basis of eigenflavor orthonormal neutrino states given by eq.([e28 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the orthonormal flavor basis ( @xmath28 ) , we can write : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the usual neutrino effective amplitude , which depends on the electron matter density @xmath52 , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are np parameters , moduli and phases , which describe the effective np neutrino interaction with matter particles @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 . in the general case these parameters depend in a complicated way on the np and matter properties . for uncharged , unpolarized and isotropic matter , parameters @xmath90",
    "are connected with @xmath91 parameters in a simple way ( see eq.([e219 ] ) below ) .",
    "for example , in the frame of the model which we consider ( eqs.([e23]),([e24 ] ) , see also @xcite ) , the effective np hamiltonian given by eq.([e217 ] ) can be determined and , neglecting second order terms in @xmath74 , is equal to : @xmath92\\label{e218}\\\\   &   & + a_{n}[\\delta\\lambda+\\delta\\lambda^{\\dagger}])\\,,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 depends on the neutron matter density @xmath94 ( in the earth matter @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 .",
    "now , by comparing equations eq.([e217 ] ) and eq.([e218 ] ) , we can find the following connection between their parameters ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 , it may often be the case that @xmath99 , and then @xmath100 entirely describe the np effects for modified matter oscillations , compare eq.([e3022 ] ) below ) : @xmath101 for high energy neutrino beams with @xmath102 , the following two small parameters , which describe @xmath7 neutrino oscillations , are important ( for lower energies , @xmath103 , a third small factor , @xmath104 , would enter into the game , too ) : @xmath105 also all @xmath100 and @xmath85 parameters , which describe np , are small .",
    "therefore , we can expand neutrino oscillation probabilities in these small quantities , keeping only the leading first order terms . in this approximation , the full transition probability , for any flavor and the baseline @xmath106 ,",
    "can be decomposed into two terms , the @xmath7 probability , and the correction to it given by np : @xmath107 the np correction probability we decompose again into two terms , the @xmath91 term which is responsible for the initial and final neutrino state modifications ( see appendix  [ app : approx ] ) and the @xmath90 term which takes into account the np influence on the coherent neutrino scattering in matter : @xmath108    the @xmath90 term consists of two terms also .",
    "the first one , which is responsible for an effective neutrino mass change , and the second one , which describes the additional np impact on coherent neutrino scattering with matter particles : @xmath109 generally , the production and detection states are not orthogonal : @xmath110 and as a consequence the probability of neutrino oscillation is not conserved : @xmath111 however , the neutrino oscillation probability of the @xmath7 is normalized to one : @xmath112 whereas the other terms satisfy : @xmath113    in the next chapter neutrino propagation in the earth matter will be discussed . in our numerical calculations of neutrino flavor transitions we use the realistic prem  i @xcite earth density profile model .",
    "however , explicit analytical formulas for the flavor transition probabilities can only be given for the case of constant density matter .",
    "both np corrections , which are important for neutrino transitions in matter , the @xmath114 and the @xmath115 , are small , therefore their linear decomposition in terms of @xmath116 and @xmath117 is a very good approximation ( in all formulas , we assume @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , where the upper / lower sign refers to the normal / inverted mass hierarchy @xcite ) : @xmath120 and similarly @xmath121    the largest terms which are not suppressed neither by @xmath116 nor by @xmath122 , namely the terms @xmath123 and @xmath124 , do not appear in any @xmath2 nor @xmath3 related channels .",
    "such terms are only present in @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath125 oscillation channels ( and in the corresponding antineutrino oscillation channels ) .",
    "for all such channels they are , up to the sign , the same and have the following form : @xmath126 and @xmath127 where @xmath128 for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 transitions , we obtain : @xmath129 unfortunately , these channels , wherein we can expect the largest np effects , are not easily achieved experimentally . to see the np effects in channels where they are suppressed , in the next chapter",
    ", we discuss one of the easiest experimental channels , the @xmath14 one .",
    "all non - leading terms in eq.([e227 ] ) and eq.([e228 ] ) , together with all terms for antineutrino and time reversal channels , are given in the appendix  [ app : approx ] .",
    "in the model which we discuss , the @xmath91 parameters are constrained from the existing experimental data ( see @xcite,@xcite ) : @xmath130 there are no constraints on the phases .",
    "the @xmath90 parameters for the neutrino propagation in matter ( eq.([e217 ] ) ) are determined from relations given by eq.([e219 ] ) .",
    "these are also the confinements which we use in the next chapter , where we present some results of our numerical calculations of the differences of the transition probabilities between cp - conjugate channels:@xmath131",
    "in order to check the effects of the np described above , the probability differences @xmath132 ( eq.([e234 ] ) ) for two energy ranges and several baselines , have been calculated .",
    "both , the energy ranges and the baselines have been chosen in prospect of the existing , planned , and feasible experiments . in view of @xmath10 and @xmath11 experiments ,",
    "the first energy range is @xmath133 and the considered baselines are @xmath134 ( @xcite ) . in view of @xmath6 experiments ,",
    "the second energy range is @xmath135 and the considered baselines are @xmath136 ( @xcite ) . in our numerical calculations of neutrino flavor transitions ,",
    "we use the realistic prem  i @xcite earth density profile model , which assesses the actual matter density @xmath137 and the actual electron fraction @xmath138 , along the neutrino flight path in the earth s interior .",

    "as the number of heavy non - decoupling neutrinos is unknown , we parametrize it in a simplified way , using a single `` effective '' heavy neutrino state . in this way ,",
    "the number of independent quantities parameterizing the matrix @xmath147 in eq.([e27 ] ) are @xmath148 moduli and @xmath62 cp phases : @xmath62 standard mixing angles ( @xmath63 ) + @xmath12 standard dirac phase ( @xmath64 ) + @xmath62 new small np mixing angles ( @xmath149 ) + @xmath150 new np dirac phases ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "then @xmath152 and    @xmath153    two sets of @xmath48 parameters , both satisfying present experimental constraints given by eq.([e233 ] ) are discussed below : @xmath154    all calculations have been performed assuming the direct mass scheme only . as nothing",
    "is known about values of cp phases , we allow them to vary freely .    for both @xmath48 sets , we notice that , the biggest potential of the discovery of the possible presence of any np is pronounced in oscillation channels in which @xmath2 , @xmath3 are not involved at all , that is in @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( including the corresponding antineutrino channels ) .",
    "the effects are especially visible for two baselines , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which , for other reasons , are also considered `` magic '' for future @xmath6 experiments . moreover , comparing numerical results for these two sets of @xmath48 parameters , we can clearly see that , as in eq.([e303].b ) the magnitude of the middle row is @xmath155 times smaller than the corresponding magnitude in eq.([e303].a ) , the np effects for the second @xmath48 set eq.([e303].b ) are smaller by a similar factor ( compare eq.([e304 ] ) below ) , too .    in order to find how the uncertainty of the estimation of the @xmath7 oscillation parameters can mimic any possible np effects ,",
    "we have also performed calculations allowing all @xmath7 oscillation parameters to vary by @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( note here that , the @xmath0 test is also useful in qualitative estimation of the effect of the uncertainties in the earth density profile on the @xmath7 results ) .",
    "we have found that in general , in order to give a chance for a discovery of np effects , it is required that @xmath7 neutrino oscillation parameter errors should be diminished to the values expected in the future ( of about @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , using neutrinos with energies @xmath156 , together with the `` magic '' baselines mentioned above , it should even be possible to see np effects with today s @xmath7 neutrino oscillation parameter uncertainties ( of about @xmath0 ) .",
    "but , this chance depends on the actual magnitudes of the np parameters and the actual precision of the experiment ( which may , of course , be required to be much better than the allowed @xmath7 neutrino oscillation parameter errors ) .            in fig.[f1 ]",
    ", the probability differences @xmath157 , for the second energy range , and the corresponding baselines set , are shown .",
    "the np effects at @xmath158 , when scaled by a factor @xmath159 , can be used as an approximate estimation of the expected results for the first energy range with its considered baselines ( for which we do not show pictures in this paper ) .    in the left and middle columns of fig.[f2 ] , the probability differences @xmath160 for the second energy range and the two `` magic '' @xmath6 baselines , are shown .",
    "for this oscillation channel , the np effect at @xmath158 is significantly smaller than in the @xmath15 channel at the same distance .",
    "this is also the case for this oscillation channel in the first energy range with its considered baselines .",
    "hence for this reason , we do not show the corresponding pictures in this paper either .",
    "note that , in general , the transition probabilities of both , neutrino and antineutrino , oscillations depend on matter properties in a different way . however , at higher energies the @xmath7 dependence is very much similar , thus any possible uncertainties in the earth density profile cancel in the @xmath7 probability differences ( see the upper row of graphs , in both figures , for @xmath156 ) . in this way ,",
    "any signal that the probability differences in this energy range are distinctly different from zero will indicate that some np exists .",
    "the statistical significance of such signal depends on its actual magnitude .",
    "for example , for the first @xmath48 set eq.([e303].a ) , and @xmath5 , there exists a maximum at @xmath161 , in which @xmath162 , while @xmath163 , and thus @xmath164 ( see the middle row of graphs in both figures ) .",
    "the neutrino energy dependent magnitude of this effect can well be reproduced just by the largest term in the @xmath165 np correction ( responsible for the effective neutrino mass change , see eq.([e228 ] ) ) , which is not suppressed neither by @xmath116 nor by @xmath122 . taking into account the fact that @xmath166 , one can write ( see eq.([e230 ] ) ) : @xmath167 it should be noted , however , that the above formula does not reproduce the @xmath157 well , in case one of the np feasible cp phases ( @xmath168 ) is equal to @xmath169 ( see the dotted and dashed curves in fig.[f1 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that in the above estimation we completely neglect several explicit cp asymmetry bracing terms , for example proportional to @xmath170 , which are relevant in the @xmath157 case , but which never appear in the case of @xmath160 ( see the appendix  [ app : approx ] , note also that , these asymmetry terms become dominant at short baselines , and that is why the np effect at @xmath158 is significantly smaller in the @xmath16 channel than in the @xmath15 channel at the same distance ) . from the above formula",
    "we can easily learn that , the magnitude of this np effect is linearly proportional to both , the actual matter density through the term @xmath171 , and to the @xmath172 np parameter ( thus , as the value of the @xmath172 parameter that results from the eq.([e303].b ) is @xmath155 times smaller than the one from the eq.([e303].a ) , the np effect for the second @xmath48 set eq.([e303].b ) is smaller by a similar factor , too ) .",
    "as already mentioned , one of the easiest channels , from the experimental point of view , is the @xmath14 one , but it will be difficult to observe any np there ( as will be in all channels in which @xmath2 or @xmath3 are involved ) . in the right column of fig.[f2 ] , the probability differences @xmath173 for the second energy range and the longest considered baseline , are shown ( where the biggest effects are expected ) . it can be seen that the np effect is rather miserable in this oscillation channel , regardless of the @xmath48 set given by eq.([e303 ] ) .",
    "this conclusion holds also for all another similar oscillation channels and both energy ranges with the corresponding baselines .",
    "moreover , these oscillation channels are sensitive to the ( not so very well known ) value of the @xmath174 . in the other channels , without @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the dependence on the @xmath174 is small , giving a better chance to see the np effects .",
    "in the paper , by introducing a mixing of the low mass `` active '' neutrinos with heavy ones , we have investigated a possible new physics ( np ) scenario which is already present at the @xmath8 scale , that means , at energies close to our present - day experimental facilities . in the presented model ( as also in any model with lepton flavor violation ) , the effective mixing matrix is non - unitary , resulting in non - orthogonal neutrino production and detection states .",
    "this leads to the modification of the neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "additionally , non - standard neutrino interactions with matter particles influence oscillation effects also .",
    "first order approximation formulas for the flavor transition probabilities , in constant density matter , for all experimentally available channels , have been given .",
    "the possibilities of experimental verification of such model predictions have been discussed in prospect of the existing , planned , and feasible @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath6 experiments .",
    "numerical calculations of flavor transition probabilities for two sets ( satisfying present experimental constraints ) of np parameters which describe a single `` effective '' heavy neutrino state have been performed .",
    "they took into account two energy ranges and several baselines , assuming both the current ( @xmath0 ) and the expected in future ( @xmath1 ) errors of today s @xmath7 neutrino oscillation parameters , keeping unchanged their present central values .",
    "the realistic prem  i earth density profile model has been applied .",
    "one of the easiest channels , from the experimental point of view , is the @xmath14 one , but it will be difficult to observe any np there ( as it will be also in all channels in which @xmath2 or @xmath3 are involved ) .",
    "it appears that the biggest potential of the discovery of any possible presence of the np is pronounced in oscillation channels in which @xmath2 , @xmath3 are not involved at all , that is in @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( and in the corresponding antineutrino channels ) .",
    "the effects are especially visible for the two so called `` magic '' @xmath6 baselines , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we have also found that in general , in order to give a chance for a discovery of the np effects , it is required that @xmath7 neutrino oscillation parameter errors should be diminished to the values expected in the future ( of about @xmath1 ) .",

    "but , this chance depends on the actual magnitudes of the np parameters and the actual precision of the experiment ( which may , of course , be required to be much better than the allowed @xmath7 neutrino oscillation parameter errors ) .",
    "finally , it should be stressed that the full quantitative treatment of the np effects in future facilities should be based on realistic observables related , for example , to the expected numbers of events at the corresponding facilities .",
    "however , as stated in the beginning of the chapter  [ sec : theory ] , this would require not only the knowledge of the np generated transition probability modifications , but also the np generated modifications of the production and detection neutrino cross sections need to be known . some preliminary studies ( see @xcite ) suggest that the expected effects on the last two terms can be of the same order as these on the first term ( shown in this paper )",
    ".    this work has been supported by the polish ministry of science under grant 1p03b04926 .",
    "herein , we collect all formulas for the flavor transition probabilities , in constant density matter , for all experimentally available neutrino and antineutrino channels . as already mentioned , in all formulas , we assume @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to the normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "firstly , we show formulas required in order to calculate the @xmath91 term in eq.([e222 ] ) , which is responsible for the initial and final neutrino state modifications ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath175\\,\\sin^{2}(\\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta}_{ik}}{2})-2\\,\\sum_{i > k}im\\,[(\\delta\\widetilde{t}^{c})_{\\alpha\\beta}^{ik}]\\,\\sin(\\widetilde{\\delta}_{ik})\\,,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath176 and @xmath177    here , @xmath178 and @xmath179 are , respectively , the effective mixing matrix elements and the effective mass square differences , coming from the diagonalization of the @xmath7 hamiltonian in matter ( without any np , see , for example , @xcite ) , and @xmath81 can be calculated by putting @xmath180 ( compare eq.([e29 ] ) ) .",
    "secondly , as described in chapter  [ sec : theory ] , not all available channels were discussed in this paper .",
    "we were only interested in @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels , including the corresponding antineutrino transitions . in this appendix , however , we collect all required equations .    in any case , the total transition probability is decomposed into several terms according to eqs.([e221]),([e222]),([e223]),([e227]),([e228 ] ) . in general , the mass term @xmath165 ( eqs.([e223]),([e228 ] ) )",

    "<S> an extension of the new standard model , by introducing a mixing of the low mass `` active '' neutrinos with heavy ones , or by any model with lepton flavor violation , is considered . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to non - orthogonal neutrino production and detection states and to modifications of neutrino oscillations in both , vacuum and matter . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of the discovery of such effects in current and future neutrino oscillation experiments is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> first order approximation formulas for the flavor transition probabilities in constant density matter , for all experimentally available channels , are given . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations of flavor transition probabilities for two sets of new physics parameters describing a single `` effective '' heavy neutrino state , both satisfying present experimental constraints , have been performed . </S>",
    "<S> two energy ranges and several baselines , assuming both the current ( @xmath0 ) and the expected in future ( @xmath1 ) errors of the neutrino oscillation parameters are considered , keeping their present central values . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the biggest potential of the discovery of the possible presence of any new physics is pronounced in oscillation channels in which @xmath2 , @xmath3 are not involved at all , especially for two baselines , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which for other reasons are also called `` magic '' for future @xmath6 experiments . </S>"
