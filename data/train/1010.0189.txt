    "multicarrier communications have recently attracted much attention in wireless and mobile applications .",
    "the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been employed as a multiplexing and a multiple access technique in a variety of wireless communication standards such as ieee802.11 wireless lan  @xcite , ieee802.16 mobile wimax  @xcite , and 3gpp - lte  @xcite .",
    "also , the multicarrier code - division multiple access ( mc - cdma ) , a combined scheme of ofdm and cdma  @xcite@xmath0@xcite , has been proposed to enjoy the benefits of ofdm and cdma by allocating the spread data symbols to subcarriers .",
    "the popularity of multicarrier communications is mainly due to the robustness to multipath fading channels and the efficient hardware implementation employing fast fourier transform ( fft ) techniques .",
    "however , multicarrier communications have the major drawback of the high peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) of transmitted signals , which may nullify all the potential benefits  @xcite .",
    "a number of techniques have been developed for papr reduction of ofdm signals .",
    "in particular , a constructive and theoretical approach is to employ a coding scheme  @xcite@xcite that provides low papr and good error correction capability for transmitted ofdm signals .",
    "the golay complementary sequences  @xcite , which belong to a coset of the first - order reed - muller code  @xcite , are a good example of the coding scheme .",
    "paterson  @xcite also discussed several coding schemes for papr reduction of _ multicode _ cdma . in  @xcite",
    ", he summarized the algebraic coding approaches for peak power control in ofdm and multicode cdma . for a summary of the other papr reduction techniques for ofdm ,",
    "see  @xcite .    to reduce the papr of multicarrier cdma ( mc - cdma ) signals , on the other hand , numerous studies have been focused on the power characteristics of spreading sequences .",
    "ochiai and imai  @xcite presented statistical results of the papr in downlink mc - cdma , where multiple users are supported by walsh - hadamard or golay complementary spreading sequences . considering a single user mc - cdma , popovi  @xcite presented the basic criteria for the selection of spreading sequences by studying the crest factors ( cf ) @xmath1 of various binary and polyphase sequences .",
    "similar studies can be found in @xcite with multiple access interference ( mai ) minimization . in mc - cdma supporting multiple users or code channels , the crest factors of various spreading sequences have been compared in @xcite and @xcite , where the walsh - hadamard spreading sequences showed the best papr properties , provided that a large number of spreading sequences are combined for the transmitted mc - cdma signals .",
    "more studies can be found in @xcite@xmath0@xcite on the papr of various spreading sequences in mc - cdma .",
    "if mc - cdma assigns multiple spreading sequences to a single user , the multicode mc - cdma can be equivalently treated as the _ spread ofdm _ ( s - ofdm )",
    "@xcite@xmath0@xcite , where a data symbol of the user is spread across a set of subcarriers to enjoy frequency diversity .",
    "if the number of used spreading sequences is large , the walsh - hadamard spread ofdm can be viewed as a papr reducing scheme  @xcite@xcite , compared to a conventional ofdm .",
    "also , an error correction code may be applied prior to walsh - hadamard spreading for improving the error rate performance  @xcite@xcite or controlling the peak power  @xcite of s - ofdm .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "most of the efforts on papr reduction of mc - cdma and s - ofdm have been verified mainly by statistical experiments , not by thorough theoretical analysis . through the experiments ,",
    "the papr of the multicarrier signals has been statistically observed , but it has never been addressed whether it is theoretically bounded . in this paper , we propose a binary reed - muller coded mc - cdma system and study its papr properties . in the coded mc - cdma , the information data multiplexed from users is encoded by a reed - muller subcode and the codeword is then fully - loaded to walsh - hadamard spreading sequences .",
    "the coding scheme plays a role of reducing the papr of transmitted mc - cdma signals as well as providing the error correction capability .",
    "we first establish the polynomial representation of a coded mc - cdma signal for theoretical analysis of the papr . a recursive construction of boolean functions is then presented for the reed - muller subcodes , where the papr of the mc - cdma signal encoded by the subcode is proven to be theoretically bounded .",
    "the author of @xcite pointed out that the construction is equivalent to type - iii sequences in @xcite where he made a general and mathematical study for boolean functions with bounded papr , not considering the application to mc - cdma .",
    "we also discuss a connection between the code rate of the subcode and the maximum papr .",
    "simulation results show that the papr of the coded mc - cdma signal is not only theoretically bounded , but also statistically reduced .",
    "in particular , the coded mc - cdma solves the major papr problem of uncoded mc - cdma by dramatically reducing its papr for the small number of users . in conclusion",
    ", the reed - muller codes can be effectively utilized for peak power control in mc - cdma with small and moderate numbers of users , subcarriers , and spreading factors .",
    "the papr properties of the coded mc - cdma equivalently address those of the reed - muller coded s - ofdm which supports multiple data from a single user .",
    "throughout this paper , mc - cdma abbreviates _ multicarrier _ cdma @xmath0 not multicode cdma .",

    "<S> reed - muller codes are studied for peak power control in multicarrier code - division multiple access ( mc - cdma ) communication systems . in a coded mc - cdma system , </S>",
    "<S> the information data multiplexed from users is encoded by a reed - muller subcode and the codeword is fully - loaded to walsh - hadamard spreading sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the polynomial representation of a coded mc - cdma signal is established for theoretical analysis of the peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reed - muller subcodes are defined in a recursive way by the boolean functions providing the transmitted mc - cdma signals with the bounded papr as well as the error correction capability . a connection between the code rates and the maximum papr is theoretically investigated in the coded mc - cdma . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results present the statistical evidence that the papr of the coded mc - cdma signal is not only theoretically bounded , but also statistically reduced . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the coded mc - cdma solves the major papr problem of uncoded mc - cdma by dramatically reducing its papr for the small number of users . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the theoretical and statistical studies show that the reed - muller subcodes are effective coding schemes for peak power control in mc - cdma with small and moderate numbers of users , subcarriers , and spreading factors .    </S>",
