    "<S> barkhausen noise , including both periodic and aperiodic components , is found in and near the relaxor regime of a familiar relaxor ferroelectric , pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 , driven by a periodic electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependences of both the amplitude and spectral form show that the size of the coherent dipole moment changes shrink as the relaxor regime is entered , contrary to expectations based on some simple models .    </S>",
    "<S> although relaxor ferroelectrics form locally ferroelectric polar nanodomains , underlying chemical disorder somehow prevents the formation of long - range ferroelectric or antiferroelectric order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , there is a crossover , characterized by faster - than - arrhenius temperature dependence of relaxation rates ( approximately of the vogel - fulcher form , e.g.  @xcite ) , to a glassy `` relaxor '' regime . </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredients of a successful model may include static random polar fields ( e.g.  @xcite ) , random anisotropy ( e.g.  @xcite ) , random interactions among the polar nanodomains ( e.g.@xcite ) , and interactions with soft to phonons @xcite and slow charge - transfer modes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nonequilibrium noise and mesoscopic noise provide model - sensitive probes of glassy freezing @xcite , unlike macroscopic linear response and the corresponding equilibrium fluctuations , which show rather generic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the barkhausen effect ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) arises because the polarization changes unevenly as an applied field changes , with the random part of the response only statistically similar between nominally identical samples . for two materials with similar average response functions </S>",
    "<S> , the barkhausen noise will be larger for the material whose polarization makes larger coherent changes .    </S>",
    "<S> although simple pictures of interacting polar nanodomains would predict that the dynamically coherent units grow as the frozen regime is entered , a previous attempt to find barkhausen noise in the relaxor regime found none , setting an upper limit on the cooperative changes of the dipole moment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> large discrete steps in polar order have been found in the best - studied relaxor , pbmg@xmath0nb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( pmn ) , but only after the applied dc electric field was large enough to drive the material into an ordinary ferroelectric regime with macroscopic domains @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we report barkhausen noise in the _ nonferroelectric _ ( paraelectric and relaxor ) regimes of pmn , where conventional barkhausen noise from macroscopic domains is absent .    the simplest barkhausen model @xcite consists of a set of polarization steps at fixed fields distributed with uniform probability over the field sweep range . for periodically driven fields , </S>",
    "<S> the noise consists of a periodically repeated random walk , so @xmath3 , the fourier power spectral density of the voltage fluctuations , will consist only of harmonics of the driving frequency @xmath4 , and its spectral envelope will decay as @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> if the step pattern changes between cycles ( e.g. , due to thermal jitter in the step times ) then there will be aperiodic noise too . </S>",
    "<S> for fast - relaxing domains which remain in quasi - equilibrium as the field changes , the polarization steps follow the smooth change in boltzmann factor vs. time ( on a coarse time scale ) , causing the @xmath5 envelope to cut off rapidly ( @xmath6 ) above a characteristic frequency @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath8 ( here , @xmath9 is the maximum amplitude of the sinusoidal driving field , @xmath10 is the typical change in electric dipole moment in a single step , and @xmath11 is boltzmann s constant . ) for domains with large barriers to switching , the switches occur as single abrupt steps . </S>",
    "<S> however , thermal jitter in the timing of otherwise reproducible steps also reduces the periodic component above @xmath7 , with a ( numerically computed ) envelope very similar to that for the fast switchers . the missing harmonic power should appear as an aperiodic component of roughly lorentzian shape and corner frequency comparable to @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> when this simple independent - step picture applies , the voltage variance ( the integral of @xmath3 ) will grow linearly with @xmath9 ( so long as @xmath12 ) @xcite , being @xcite @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the geometrical capacitance , and we assume the dimensionless dielectric constant @xmath15 . when there is a range of @xmath10 s , @xmath10 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : totbkhnoise ] is replaced by @xmath16 .    generically , if the non - arrhenius slowing down of relaxation rates arises because interacting nanodomains form clusters which reorient coherently but with barriers which increase with cluster size ( e.g.  as in the random - field ising model @xcite ) , then the dipole moments of the coherent clusters ( even if the constituents are randomly aligned ) would grow as @xmath17 was reduced , causing @xmath18 and @xmath7 to rise . </S>",
    "<S> if the activation barrier heights for some clusters become too large for them to respond at or near @xmath4 for a given @xmath9 , then the typical @xmath10 would saturate near the moment of the largest responding clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the largest responding cluster would shrink slightly as @xmath17 is reduced further , but only as @xmath17 to a power less than 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we found neither continued growth nor approximate saturation of the noise magnitude and frequency range , but instead abrupt shrinkage .    </S>",
    "<S> our sample consisted of two pieces , each about 0.75  mm thick , from a single crystal of pmn , grown by the chokhralsky method at the rostov - on - don institute of physics . </S>",
    "<S> the sputtered gold contact pads on the main ( 001 ) faces had about 1  mm@xmath19 surface area each .     and </S>",

    "<S> the inset shows the nonlinear out - of - phase response , most apparent at high-@xmath17 where the linear out - of - phase response is tiny.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    standard ac susceptibility measurements at 50  hz showed the usual pmn relaxor behavior , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the response was close enough to linear over the field range employed in the noise experiments for the linear susceptibility to suffice for approximate calculations . </S>",
    "<S> previous experiments @xcite have shown that the apparent vogel - fulcher freezing temperature of pmn ( @xmath21  k ) determined by ac response is essentially unchanged over the field range used in these experiments , although it drops sharply at higher fields .    </S>",
    "<S> g is the gain of the driving op - amps . </S>",
    "<S> data were taken on the 14-bit converter in sets of 30,000 points with a 10  khz sampling rate , giving 1/3  hz frequency bins in the fourier spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> usually 16 such spectra were averaged . </S>",
    "<S> the anti - alias filter corner frequency was 5  khz , although it should have been 4  khz.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for the noise measurements , the two halves of the sample were incorporated in a balanced - bridge circuit , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this setup allowed us to apply an ac bias up to 10  volts on each half of the sample without overloading the low - noise amplifiers , despite the generation of harmonics by the sample nonlinearity , slow capacitance changes due to systematic aging effects @xcite , and imperfect common - mode rejection . </S>",
    "<S> however , any residual systematic differences in the nonlinearity of the two parts would generate harmonics . </S>",
    "<S> an experiment in which one sample arm was replaced with a polystyrene capacitor indicated significant systematic harmonics out to the fifth harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> we avoided using harmonics lower than the tenth in the data analysis , since systematic nonlinearities are distinct from barkhausen noise . </S>",
    "<S> the ac source has very low levels of noise and distortion , and the analog - to - digital sampling is synchronized well with the ac drive .     with @xmath22  </S>",
    "<S> v / cm at @xmath23  hz at 244  k ( spectrum 2 ) is shown above a background ( spectrum 1 ) consisting of equilibrium noise from the dissipative sample plus amplifier noise , mainly from current noise from the stanford 550 preamp . </S>",
    "<S> 60  hz and its harmonics have been edited out.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows a typical @xmath3 with , roughly as expected , a mixture of periodic and broad aperiodic noise . </S>",
    "<S> the wings around @xmath4 ( and to a lesser extent around low harmonics ) were not anticipated , but these can arise from small drifts in the bridge cancellation as the sample ages . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the polarization events , calculated below from @xmath3 , was far too small for them to be discerned individually .     for ( a ) aperiodic and ( b ) periodic components.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    since the spectral form is close to the independent - step expectation , we can extract a typical step size @xmath10 , although we doubt that the polarization changes literally consist of simple discrete steps . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , both periodic and aperiodic components of the noise grow nonlinearly with @xmath9 over the range explored . </S>",
    "<S> thus the @xmath10 calculated at some @xmath9 gives only a typical dipole step size under the particular drive conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the nonlinearity suggests a broad distribution of @xmath10 s , with many small @xmath10 s showing up in the noise only as @xmath9 is increased enough to make @xmath24 for that @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the aperiodic spectrum indicates a similar distribution .    although we are not yet confident in extracting absolute step sizes from this new technique ( mainly due to the difficulty of removing all artifacts from the lower harmonics , which contain the most power ) , we can use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : totbkhnoise ] to calculate a lower - bound estimate for a typical @xmath10 by integrating the broad aperiodic spectrum only . </S>",
    "<S> ( we assume this @xmath10 reflects about how big the cooperative changes are regardless of whether they are simple discrete steps . ) at @xmath25  k , just above the relaxor regime , at the largest @xmath9 used , the result is about @xmath26  c  cm , which apparently would grow at higher @xmath9 . under the same conditions , </S>",
    "<S> the envelope of the harmonic noise has a @xmath5 tail extending from about 1  khz to 4  khz , the top of our measured range , indicating that there are some discrete dipole switches as large as @xmath27  c  cm . </S>",
    "<S> an order - of - magnitude estimate of the moment of a polar nanodomain at 250  k , based on the range of the static polar correlations @xcite and the saturation polarization @xcite , would be about @xmath28  c  cm . </S>",
    "<S> thus it seems that even in the _ paraelectric _ regime there are some dynamically coherent units larger than single polar nanodomains .    despite the uncertainties in the absolute calibration , we can obtain a good indication of how typical @xmath10 s depend on @xmath17 , a key issue for relaxor models . for independent steps , the quantity @xmath29 is proportional to the actual @xmath10 s under particular experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] shows how some periodic and aperiodic components of @xmath30 depend on @xmath17 at fixed @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we pick spectral components in an octave around @xmath31 , because in this range the signal - to - background is still good , we expect few artifacts in the harmonics , and the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath10 shows up in @xmath3 both via the overall magnitude and via the @xmath17-dependence of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> ( other frequency components show the same sort of behavior , just less clearly . )    , are shown vs. @xmath17 at two different @xmath9.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , as the relaxor regime is approached from high @xmath17 , the spectral components of @xmath32 either rise slowly , as one would guess from the growth of medium - range static correlations @xcite , or show little change . </S>",
    "<S> however , below 235  k to 250  k , both periodic and aperiodic components drop sharply , in sharp contrast to the continued growth of static correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath33 accounts for less than half of this drop .    </S>",
    "<S> the width of the envelope of the harmonic components is also @xmath17-dependent , being largest ( for @xmath34  v / cm ) at 250  k. in contrast to the long @xmath5 tail at 250  k , below 250  k the harmonics fell sharply into the anharmonic background , e.g.  becoming undetectable above about 900  hz at 210  k , confirming that the largest dipole moment steps occur near 250  k.    in summary , our noise results indicate abrupt shrinkage of the typical net dipole moment of the dynamically coherent changes ( at fixed driving field ) as the relaxor regime is entered . </S>",
    "<S> we do not want to burden this experimental result with much theory , but some initial comments should be helpful .    </S>",
    "<S> we know of no proposed model in which the coherent dipole moment differences between the _ equilibrium _ states at different fields would shrink sharply in the relaxor regime ( i.e. , relaxors are not believed to be frustrated antiferroelectrics ) . </S>",
    "<S> rather , the shrinkage of the steps found on a fixed frequency scale should be related to the vogel - fulcher kinetics @xcite , i.e. , to the rapid growth of barrier heights as the relaxor regime is approached . </S>",
    "<S> although our results do not dictate a model for the relaxor transition in pmn , we can rule out some models .    a model of the dynamics with a fixed set of relaxation modes with a fixed broad unimodal distribution of activation barriers ( presumably monotonically increasing in @xmath10 ) @xcite , would predict that the characteristic @xmath10 is a weakly increasing function of @xmath17 at all @xmath17 , and hence is inconsistent with our results . for </S>",
    "<S> simple growth of independent polar nanodomains , the dipoles grow along with the anisotropy barriers , so the typical dipole moment for which the field ( plus thermal activation ) allows switches at rates of order @xmath7 would continue to grow . </S>",
    "<S> for formation of coherently flipping clusters , the typical moment also grows with the number of nanodomains ( probably as a square root ) . although the moment to barrier ratio would be lower for larger clusters , the moment of the largest clusters with rapid enough driven kinetics would approximately saturate . unless there were a strange distribution of cluster sizes , so that as the typical size grew , the mean of those remaining below some fixed cutoff would shrink , such models would not reproduce our results .    thus the barkhausen results strongly suggest that the rapid growth of barriers is not just the result of nanodomain growth or of collective nanodomain clusters forming . instead , it seems that each nanodomain s contribution to the barriers grows much more rapidly than its contribution to the dipole moment , as in a recent phenomenological model @xcite , suggesting that less - polar degrees of freedom are freezing along with the polar nanodomain orientations . </S>",
    "<S> another indication of some such effects is that the low - temperature linear heat capacity specifically associated with the relaxor @xcite gives a dimensionless entropy of about @xmath35 per nanodomain .    </S>",
    "<S> models of relaxor freezing invoking strong coupling of nanodomain polarization to multiple slow local degrees of freedom ( particularly charge transfers ) and to soft to phonon modes @xcite have been proposed to account for clusters with multiple metastable polarization states having a roughly uniform distribution in solid angle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such models would allow complex aging @xcite even in small clusters of nanodomains . </S>",
    "<S> whether or not such models prove successful , the barkhausen data provide a new qualitative constraint on models for the relaxor transition , which has thus far provided a target for somewhat under - constrained theory . </S>"
