    "extended red emission ( ere ) is a continuous emission band observed in the red part ( 600800  nm ) of the spectrum of various astrophysical objects like reflection nebulae ( @xcite , @xcite ) , planetary nebulae ( @xcite ) , h regions ( @xcite , @xcite ) , high - latitude galactic cirrus clouds ( @xcite ) , the halo of the galaxy m82 ( @xcite ) and also in the diffuse galactic interstellar medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "this emission can be attributed either to hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) grains ( @xcite , @xcite ) or silicon grains ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a series of emission bands in the 316@xmath0 m range , the so - called uirbs , is also observed in dusty environments and commonly attributed to polycyclic aromatic molecules ( pah)(@xcite , @xcite ) and/or carbonaceous materials ( @xcite ) . in particular , the existence ( or absence ) of a spatial correlation between iurbs and ere might be useful to put constrains on the nature of the carriers .",
    "compact h regions are bright and dusty objects well suited for this kind of study . + this is the reason why we have carried out an observational program for imaging compact h regions at visible and infrared wavelengths in order to detect and to map respectively ere and uirbs .",
    "this paper reports on the results obtained for sh  152 .",
    "infrared images of sh  152 were obtained with in june 1997 , during iso revolution 563 . these include uirbs images at 3.3 and 6.2@xmath0 m and four continuum images taken with the isocam circular variable filter ( cvf ) at 6.911 , 8.222 , 10.52 and 12.00@xmath0 m .",
    "these observations and data reduction are described in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the 3.3 and 6.2@xmath0 m images presented in this paper were corrected for the adjacent continuum emission .",
    "+ visible images in the 500850  nm range were obtained , in october 1997 , with a 1024 @xmath1 1024 thinned back - illuminated tektronix ccd camera mounted at the newton focus of the 120  cm telescope of the observatoire de haute provence .",
    "four interference filters with a fwhm  @xmath210  nm centered on 528.2 , 612.0 , 697.5 and 812.5  nm were used .",
    "these filters were chosen to isolate the continuum emission of sh  152 and to avoid nebular and night sky emission lines .",
    "for each continuum filter , twenty - five 15 min exposure time frames were obtained and co - added , yielding a resulting image of six hours exposure time .",
    "standard data reduction was performed using eso - midas software .",
    "it includes : dark current subtraction , flat fielding , airmass and interstellar extinction corrections , deconvolution by point spread function . according to spectroscopic observations of ere in h regions ( @xcite ) , the emission excess in the 697.5 and/or 812.5  nm filters",
    "should be attributed to ere .",
    "actually the best contrasted results were obtained by making the difference between the 697.5 and 612.0  nm images .",
    "the resulting image was considered as giving the spatial distribution of ere over sh  152 .",
    "the 3.3@xmath0 m , 6.2@xmath0 m and h@xmath3 images of sh  152 are displayed in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the 3.3 and 6.2@xmath0 m emission bands have the same spatial distribution over the entire nebula .",
    "this suggests their carriers could be the same .",
    "also , it appears from figure  [ fig : fig1 ] that the infrared emissions arise from regions located outside the ionized regions ( traced by h@xmath3 emission ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] presents the spatial distribution of ere superimposed on the 6.2@xmath0 m band image and the h@xmath3 image .",
    "ere is found to coincide with the h@xmath3 emission but significantly differs from that of the 6.2@xmath0 m emission band . hydrogen environment and uv radiation are well suited to induce luminescence from hac grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] presents the spatial distribution of ere superimposed on a 12@xmath0 m continuum image .",
    "it can be seen that the 12@xmath0 m emission extends over the area where the ere intensity reaches its maximum .",
    "this coincidence is in favor of grains as carriers of the ere because ( i ) the 12@xmath0 m emission is thought to be the short wavelength part of a strong thermal emission from cold grains ( see , for example , ir spectra of ultra compact galactic h regions presented by @xcite)and ( ii ) because such cold grains can exist in sh  152 at the distance from the exciting star where the observed coincidence occurs .",
    "+ in effect , according to @xcite , the temperature of a dust solid particle located at a distance 10@xmath4  r@xmath5  = 2.10@xmath6  au = 10@xmath7  pc from an o9.5 v star of radius r@xmath8  au , would be of 200k for a silicate grain or 400k for a carbonaceous grain .",
    "the region in sh  152 where ere maximum and 12  @xmath0 m emission coincide is in fact much farther from the star ( about 0.2 pc , assuming a distance of 3.5  kpc for sh  152 ( @xcite ) ) than in the calculations so that , although the exciting star of sh  152 is slightly hotter than an o9.5v star ( @xcite ) , we can assume that cold grains do exist in the area .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4 ] presents the four continuum images of sh  152 at 6.911 , 8.222 , 10.52 and 12.00@xmath0 m taken with isocam . in these images , the flux is normalized to the maximum observed in the lw6 filter , centered at 7.7@xmath0 m . at the location of the ere maximum ,",
    "the infrared images show flux values increasing with wavelength : this is in agreement with thermal emission from cold grains ( note that the 10.52@xmath0 m flux might be contaminated by the [ siv ] 10.54@xmath0 m emission line ) .",
    "visible and infrared images of sh  152 allowed us to compare the spatial distribution of ere and uirbs and to deduce basic physical properties .",
    "we found that : +    * the spatial distribution of the two uirbs at 3.3 and 6.2@xmath0 m are the same , suggesting similar properties for their carriers * the uirbs emission peak is located at the border of the ionized region * the ere emission coincides with the ionized region and significantly differs from the uirbs location .",
    "* the continuum emission observed between 10.5 and 12@xmath0 m is coincident with ere emission and possibly due to cold grains , which is in favor of grains as carriers of the ere ."
