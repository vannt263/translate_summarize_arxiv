    "<S> we consider the angle @xmath0 of inclination ( with respect to the horizontal ) of the profile of a steady 2d inviscid symmetric periodic or solitary water wave subject to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath0 may surpass @xmath1 for some irrotational waves close to the extreme wave , amick @xcite proved that for any irrotational wave the angle must be less than 31.15@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> is the situation similar for periodic or solitary waves that are not irrotational ? </S>",
    "<S> the extreme gerstner wave has infinite depth , adverse vorticity and vertical cusps ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , numerical calculations show that even waves of finite depth can overturn if the vorticity is adverse . in this paper , on the other hand , we prove an upper bound of 45@xmath2 on @xmath0 for a large class of waves with favorable vorticity and finite depth . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the vorticity can be any constant with the favorable sign . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove a series of general inequalities on the pressure within the fluid , including the fact that any overturning wave must have a pressure sink . </S>"
