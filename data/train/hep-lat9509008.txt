    "elucidating the nature of chiral transition separating the high - temperature quark - gluon plasma phase from the low - temperature hadron phase has been one of the focal points of effort in recent numerical simulations of full lattice qcd including light dynamical quarks .",
    "much of work in this direction has employed the kogut - susskind quark action since it retains a @xmath1 subgroup of chiral symmetry . on the other hand , studies with the wilson quark action",
    "are less well developed in spite of the effort over the years@xcite .",
    "a main problem for studies with wilson fermions originates from the presence of explicit chiral symmetry breaking in the action at non - zero lattice spacing , which is introduced to avoid the well - known species doubling problem .",
    "clearly , before serious studies on the phase structure at finite temperature are initiated , more understanding on the effect of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking at zero temperature is necessary .",
    "let me consider a phase space of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at zero temperature , where @xmath4 is the bare gauge coupling , @xmath5 the bare quark mass , and @xmath6 the lattice spacing .",
    "there is much evidence from analytical considerations and numerical simulations of hadron masses that the pion mass vanishes along a line @xmath7 , the critical line , which runs from @xmath8 in the strong - coupling limit to @xmath9 in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "however the massless pion appeared on @xmath10 can not be regarded as the nambu - goldstone boson of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry since it is explicitly broken in the wilson fermion formulation at non - zero lattice spacing .",
    "why does the massless pion appear then ? it has conventionally been explained as follows : the appearance of the massless pion on @xmath0 may be an evidence that the tuning @xmath11 effectively recovers the chiral symmetry , explicitly broken by the wilson fermion formulation .",
    "off course , this in not an explanation , since it does not tell why the massless pion appear on @xmath0 .",
    "it also can not tell what happens beyond @xmath0 .    instead of the conventional explanation ,",
    "a possible explanation was proposed some years ago , to explain the appearance of the massless pion@xcite , on the basis of new phase structure of lattice qcd with wilson fermions .",
    "later some analytic@xcite and numerical@xcite evidences were given for the existence of the phase structure , but it is far from being completely established . in this report , after reviewing the previous accomplishment , more evidences are supplied to established the proposed phase structure .",
    "in this section we review the possible explanation for the massless pion appeared on @xmath0 in the wilson fermion formulation@xcite .",
    "let me consider lattice qcd with a single flavor first . in the theory there exists one `` @xmath12 meson '' , corresponding to a pseudo - scalar operator @xmath13 . at @xmath14 the correlation function of the operator for large",
    "@xmath15 behaves such that @xmath16 where the correlation length @xmath17 is related to the mass of the @xmath12 meson as @xmath18 . since the correlation length diverges on @xmath0 the correlation function for large @xmath15 behaves at @xmath19 such that @xmath20 with some exponent @xmath21 .",
    "if we go beyond @xmath0 ( @xmath22 ) , it is expected for large @xmath15 that @xmath23 with @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a space volume .",
    "the above situation is summarized as follows . since the massless @xmath12 meson implies the divergent correlation length on @xmath0 , the operator corresponding to the @xmath12 meson has the long - range order at @xmath22 in such a way that @xmath24 .",
    "this condensation spontaneously breaks the discrete parity at @xmath26 and the second order phase transition from the parity symmetric phase to the parity broken one occurs at @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the massless @xmath12 meson can be interpretated as the divergent correlation length associated with this second order phase transition , not a nambu - goldstone boson .    according to the above interpretation we expect near @xmath0 , @xmath28 with another critical exponent @xmath29 .",
    "if we regards the effective theory for the @xmath12 meson as a four - dimensional scalar field theory , we can expect the phase transition to be mean - field like up to the logarithmic corrections and therefore @xmath30 , which reproduces well - known pcac relation that @xmath31 where a quark mass @xmath32 .",
    "now we consider qcd with 2 flavors , where members of the pseudo - scalar mesons are @xmath33 ( non - singlet ) and @xmath34 ( singlet ) .",
    "since the observed mass spectra of these mesons satisfy @xmath35 , it is expected at @xmath27 that @xmath36 . to satisfy this",
    ", there exists a phase transition at @xmath19 , which implies the condensation such that @xmath37 at @xmath22 .",
    "the above condensation spontaneously breaks both parity and flavor symmetry . in this case",
    "the neutral @xmath38 meson corresponding to the @xmath39 operator is identified with the massless mode of this phase transition and becomes massless only at the transition point @xmath19 .",
    "the charged @xmath40 mesons corresponding to the linear combination of @xmath41 and @xmath42 operators are nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the flavor symmetry breaking : @xmath43 in the phase with @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the phase with @xmath46 . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath47 meson stays massive for all @xmath11 since @xmath48 is always zero .",
    "this phase transition can naturally solve not only the problem of the massless pion but also the lattice u(1 ) problem@xcite .",
    "one can rigorously prove that @xmath49 using _ a la _ vafa - witten theorem@xcite , while no such restriction can be applied to the operator @xmath39 , since the wilson fermion determinant is shown to be real - positive for @xmath50 even in the presence of the source term @xmath51 .",
    "in the strong coupling ( @xmath52 ) and large @xmath53 limit we can analytically calculated the behavior of order parameter and meson masses@xcite : @xmath54 where the critical point is given by @xmath55(@xmath56 ) with @xmath57 . in this limit",
    "there is no essential difference between @xmath58 and @xmath50 .",
    "it was also shown that the @xmath12 meson becomes massless on @xmath59@xcite .    in the strong coupling and 1/@xmath53 expansions",
    "the behavior of the order parameter is essentially the same for @xmath58 case : @xmath60 at @xmath61 , and the pion becomes massless on @xmath62 , which was calculated in the expansion of @xmath63@xcite .",
    "for @xmath64 we obtain @xmath65 at @xmath61 while @xmath66 for all @xmath67 , as expected@xcite .",
    "meson spectrum also agrees with our expectation in the previous section .      to calculate quark propagators on a given configuration iterative methods such as conjugate gradiant ( cg ) method are usually used to invert the lattice fermion matrix . for the case of the wilson fermion ,",
    "if @xmath11 approaches @xmath0 , the inversion becomes more and more difficult : a number of cg iteration rapidly increases . to overcome this difficulty and to calculate non - zero order parameter",
    ", we add an external field coupled to the order parameter and take @xmath68 limit after the average over configurations is taken .",
    "let me consider the quenched qcd first .",
    "if we add the external field @xmath69 to the wilson fermion action , it is easy to show that @xmath70 where @xmath71 means a value of an operator @xmath72 on a given gauge configuration @xmath73 and the external source @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath68 limit was non - singular , this would lead to @xmath75 before the average over gauge configurations .",
    "therefore @xmath76 in the numerical simulation on a finite lattice , where the limit is always non - singular .",
    "however this does not means @xmath77 .",
    "since , in the parity broken phase , @xmath68 limit is singular as the volume @xmath25 goes to infinity one should take limits in the following order : @xmath78 .\\ ] ] since actual numerical simulations are always performed on finite volumes , one should extrapolate to @xmath79 from non - zero @xmath74 , not put @xmath80 in the simulation , in order to obtain the correct value of @xmath81 at @xmath80 in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this external source method has been applied to show that the parity breaking phase transition exists at @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is temperature , using the quenched qcd simulation at @xmath84 on a @xmath85 lattice@xcite .",
    "such a phase transition disappear at @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the critical temperature of the pure gauge theory , using the quenched qcd simulation at @xmath88 , 5.8 on a @xmath89 lattice@xcite .    for the case of full qcd with 2 flavors , a term @xmath90 should be added . even in the presence of the term",
    "the wilson fermion determinant is still real - positive .",
    "therefore the hybrid monte carlo method is applicable to this case .",
    "again we have to keep @xmath74 non - zero for simulations on a finite volume , in order to find the spontaneous breakdown of parity and flavor symmetry .",
    "the hybrid monte carlo simulation has been performed for the full qcd with @xmath50 at @xmath84 on @xmath85 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 lattices@xcite .",
    "although some evidence for the parity and flavor symmetry breaking phase transition was observed , @xmath68 extrapolation was too difficult to prove the existence of the phase transition without doubt .",
    "lattice sizes used may be too small for this @xmath63 .",
    "since the numerical evidence of the phase transition is established for the quenched case but is ambiguous for the case of the full qcd , we carry out new full qcd simulation with @xmath64 at @xmath93 , where the analytic expressions for the order parameters are available for non - zero external field @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ ordb0 ] , @xmath94 is plotted as a function of @xmath67 at @xmath52 on a @xmath85 lattice with @xmath95 , together with the analytic expressions with the corresponding @xmath74 in the strong coupling and large @xmath53 limits , since the agreement between the numerical data and the analytic predictions are very good , it can be established at least in the strong coupling limit that the parity and flavor symmetry breaking phase transition really occurs at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath94 becomes non - zero in the @xmath68 extrapolation at @xmath98 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we have checked that the finite size effect to the order parameter is very small by comparing the data on a @xmath85 lattice with the data on a @xmath92 lattice or with the analytic expressions corresponding to the values in the infinite volume limit .    as a further check",
    "we have calculated susceptibilities @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , which are defined by @xmath102 ^ 2 \\rangle \\\\",
    "\\chi_{00 } & = & \\frac{1}{v}\\langle [ \\sum_x \\bar\\psi \\psi ( x)]^2 \\rangle \\\\ \\chi_{50 } & = & \\frac{1}{v}\\langle [ \\sum_x \\bar\\psi i\\gamma_5\\tau^3 \\psi ( x ) ] \\times [ \\sum_y \\bar\\psi \\psi ( y ) ] \\rangle , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] both analytically and numerically .",
    "for example , @xmath99 is plotted in fig .",
    "the agreement between them are reasonably good , except some deviations are observed deep in the broken phase",
    ". therefore , the result for the susceptibilities also support our conclusion about the existence of the phase transition .",
    "if we consider the above result from the opposite side it can be said that the success of our analytic calculations , except the deviation in the susceptibilities deep in the broken phase , establishes the validity of the strong coupling and large @xmath53 expansions near the limits .",
    "furthermore , since the expansions predict the existence of the phase transition , we can conclude that the parity and flavor symmetry breaking is shown to exist in the strong coupling region .",
    "finally let me comment on the deviations in the susceptibilities observed deep in the broken phase .",
    "we think that the deviations are caused by the massless nambu - goldstone charged pions appeared in the broken phase , whose effect to the susceptibilities can not be included in the analytic calculation of the large @xmath53 limit .",
    "we expect the agreement will become better if we include the effect in our analytic expressions .",
    "in the previous section we have established the phase structure in the strong coupling region .",
    "there are two critical lines @xmath62 and @xmath103 in @xmath63 - @xmath67 plane , which separate the broken phase from the symmetric phases : @xmath104 at @xmath105 and @xmath106 at @xmath107 or @xmath108 . in this section",
    "we investigate how this phase structure will be modified in the weak coupling region .    in fig .",
    "[ phase ] we propose the expected phase structure of lattice qcd with 2 flavor wilson fermions in the @xmath63 - @xmath67 plane . at @xmath109",
    "there are only two critical lines , while there are ten critical lines at @xmath110 and 5 points where two lines meat at @xmath111 .",
    "each point corresponds to one continuum limit , whose low energy spectra are composed of a part of sixteen zero modes of the lattice fermion : one mode near @xmath112 appears at @xmath113 , four modes near @xmath114 and its permutation at @xmath115 , six modes near @xmath116 and its permutation at @xmath117 , four modes near @xmath118 its permutation at @xmath119 , and one mode near @xmath120 at @xmath121 .",
    "note that the phase diagram is shown to be symmetric under @xmath122 transformation .",
    "it is also noted that the width of the broken phase in the weak coupling should behave like @xmath123 $ ] where @xmath124 is some constant and @xmath125 is some regular function of @xmath126 , since the appearance of the width has not been detected by the usual perturbative expansion , and therefore should be non - perturbative .",
    "there are several evidences for the existence of the multiple critical lines in the weak coupling region .",
    "first of all , the phase structure similar to fig .  [ phase ] has been found for the gross - nevue model in 2 dimensions in the large @xmath127 limit , regulated on the lattice using wilson fermions@xcite .",
    "the existence of the multiple structure of the critical line has been also suggested from studies of eigen - value spectra of the wilson fermion matrix on quenched configurations@xcite and full qcd configurations@xcite .    to establish the multiple structure of the critical lines we have performed new simulation using quenched configurations _ without _ adding the external field @xmath128 .",
    "we first monitored the quantity so - called `` pion norm '' : @xmath129 ^ 2 \\rangle $ ] .",
    "this quantity becomes very large in the broken phase , due to the contribution from zero modes of the wilson fermion matrix .",
    "although some signals for the multiple structure of the broken phases are observed in this quantity , more clear indicator for the multiple structure of the broken phases is found to be the number of the cg iteration necessary to invert the wilson fermion matrix .",
    "this quantity becomes very large and is proportional to the volume in the presence of zero modes of the wilson fermion matrix , which are expected to exist in the broken phase .",
    "we have plotted the number of cg iterations as a function of @xmath67 at @xmath84 , 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.7 on @xmath92 lattices in fig.[cg1 ] , and at @xmath130 5.8 , 5.9 , 6.0 on @xmath131 lattices in fig.[cg2 ] .",
    "the multiple structure of the broken phase is clearly observed at @xmath132 .",
    "finally we calculate again the order parameter @xmath133 with small non - zero external field , @xmath134 , in the weak coupling region ( @xmath135 ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ ordw ] , the multiple structure of the broken phases is again observed",
    "the phase transition which causes or is caused by the massless pion appeared in lattice qcd with the wilson fermion formulation seems to exist at @xmath27 . in the strong coupling region at @xmath136 it is established that @xmath137 for the quenched qcd and @xmath138 for the 2 flavor full qcd . the evidence of the multiple structure of the critical lines are also given in the weak coupling region in the case of the quenched qcd .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is very important to study the phase structure of lattice qcd at finite temperature . in the case of the wilson fermion formulation one",
    "should understand , based on the finding of this report , the relation between the critical line discussed in this report and the finite temperature phase transition line .",
    "recently such an investigation has been carried out@xcite for the 2 flavor qcd .",
