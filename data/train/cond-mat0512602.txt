    "we have proved that spin-3/2 fermionic systems with contact interactions , which can be realized by atoms such as @xmath5cs , @xmath6be , @xmath7ba , @xmath8ba and @xmath9hg , enjoy a generic @xmath10 symmetry for the continuum model with @xmath0-wave scattering interactions and the lattice hubbard model , whose exactness is regardless of dimensionality , lattice geometry and external potentials @xcite .",

    "the half - quantum vortex in superfluids with the spin degree of freedom is an exotic topological defect as a global analogue of the alice string in gauge theories @xcite .",

    "meanwhile the half - quantum vortex loop also changes @xmath18 to maintain spin conservation .",
    "however , due to the abelian nature of this @xmath16 cheshire charge , no entanglement is generated in this process .    in this article , we investigate the non - abelian alice string and the topological generation of quantum entanglement through the non - abelian cheshire charge in spin-3/2 systems .",
