    "infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) leads to severe lymphopenia and general immune dysfunction .",
    "combination antiretroviral therapy ( cart ) allows controlling viral load in most patients and often leads to an adequate immune restoration .",
    "however , not all patients get a satisfactory immune reconstitution despite undetectable viral load .",
    "sereti et al [ 1 ] called these patients `` immunological non responders '' ; we prefer to call them `` immunological low responders '' because these patients can still experience an increase of cd4@xmath0 t cells count under cart , albeit insufficient .",
    "a treatment based on injections of exogenous interleukin-7 ( il-7 ) has been recently proposed , and is for the moment the only promising approach in this context ( sereti et al [ 2 ] , levy et al [ 3,4 ] ) .",
    "endogenous il-7 is a cytokine produced by non - marrow - derived stromal and epithelial cells , and since it was discovered in 1988 ( namen et al [ 5 ] ) , it has been found to play an important role in peripheral maintenance of t cells ( fry et al [ 6 ] , mackall et al [ 7 ] ) . in hiv - infected patients ,",
    "a correlation between plasma levels of endogenous il-7 and cd4@xmath0 t cell counts has already been reported ( beq et al [ 8 ] ) , and different mechanisms of action of il-7 regarding regulation of t lymphocytes number and behavior have been uncovered , as enhancing thymopoiesis ( mackall et al [ 7 ] , okamoto et al [ 9 ] ) , proliferation ( vieira et al [ 10 ] , sportes et al [ 11 ] ) and survival ( seddon et al [ 12 ] , kondrack et al [ 13 ] ) of cd4@xmath0 t cells .",
    "mathematical representations of the behavior of the immune system in the context of hiv infection have been useful to describe and quantify biological processes that are not directly observed ; the interaction between hiv virions and cd4@xmath0 t cells was firstly modeled by ho et al [ 14 ] and perelson et al [ 15 ] . for modeling the effect of exogenous il-7 administration , it is not useful to model virus concentration ( because viral load is undetectable under cart ) , but it is necessary to distinguish between quiescent and proliferating cells . in this context , thibaut et al [ 16 ] have quantified the contribution of several biological mechanisms in cd4@xmath0 t cells homeostasis .",
    "they have studied the effect of a single cycle of exogenous il-7 . here ,",
    "we extend this approach with a modified statistical model for analyzing repeated cycles , based on data from 3 clinical studies , inspire , inspire 2 and inspire 3 .",
    "we focus on several major clinical questions .",
    "what is the effect of the different injections in a cycle ?",
    "what is the effect of repeated cycles ?",
    "what is the long - term efficacy of this therapy in maintaining cd4@xmath0 t cells count at a satisfactory level ( over 500 cells/@xmath2l ) ?",
    "what is the best protocol of injections ?    this paper is divided into 7 sections .",
    "section 2 gives an overview of the inspire studies and the available data .",
    "section 3 describes the main structure of the mathematical and statistical models .",
    "section 4 presents and compares different statistical models : the  basic model \" studying the effect of exogenous il-7 over a cycle as a whole , the  3 @xmath3 s model \" allowing the successive injections of a cycle to have different effects , and the  cycle effect model \" investigating the long term effect when administering repeated cycles .",
    "section 5 compares results of four possible protocols ( varying the number of injections of a cycle ) and predicts their impact on the maintenance of cd4@xmath0 t cells count @xmath4 500 cells/@xmath2l for an average patient .",
    "section 6 explores the possibility of optimizing the protocol by investigating in simulation the trajectories of cd4@xmath0 t cells count in good and bad responders .",
    "section 7 concludes .",
    "the data have been compiled from three phase i / ii multicenter studies : inspire ( levy et al [ 4 ] ) , inspire 2 and inspire 3 ( thibaut et al [ 17 ] ) .",
    "these studies investigated the effect of a _ purified glycosylated recombinant human interleukin 7 _ ( r - hil-7 ) treatment on immune restoration in immunological low responder patients .",
    "all participants were aged @xmath5 18 years , were under stable cart for at least 2 years , presenting cd4@xmath0 t cells count between 100 - 350 cells/@xmath2l ( 100 - 400 cells/@xmath2l for inspire 2 ) , and undetectable viral load for at least 6 months prior to screening .    in the first study ,",
    "inspire , 21 patients received three weekly injections ( a  complete cycle \" ) of r - hil-7 at different weight - dependent doses : 10 , 20 and 30 @xmath2g / kg and the main objective was to evaluate the safety of this treatment . inspire 2 and inspire 3 ( with 23 and 84 treated patients , respectively ) further studied the biological activity ( as well as the safety ) of repeated cycles of r - hil-7 at 20 @xmath2g / kg . in this paper ,",
    "data for all treated patients from the three studies ( n=128 ) have been included from the time of the first injection .",
    "overall , 197 r - hil-7 cycles were administered ( 41 of them were incomplete cycles consisting of 1 or 2 injections ) . more details are provided in a previous publication ( thibaut et al [ 17 ] ) .      within the first inspire study , all patients received complete cycles .",
    "they had clinic visits at weeks 1 , 2 and 3 ( at the moment of the injections ) , weeks 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 and 12 , and after , one visit every 3 months ; see levy et al [ 4 ] for more information . among many measured biomarkers ,",
    "our model uses total cd4@xmath0 t cells count and the number of cd4@xmath0 t cells expressing the ki67 proliferation marker , hereafter called  cd4 count \" and  ki67 count \" , respectively . measurements of cd4 counts were made at each visit , while ki67 counts were only measured at weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 12 .    for the first twelve patients of inspire 2 , clinic visits within the initial cycles",
    "were scheduled as for the inspire study ( for the rest of them , visits at week 9 were not performed ) .",
    "after , if cd4 counts were found to be below 550 cells/@xmath2l in one of the quarterly visits , a new r - hil-7 cycle was administered ( with the exception of the first 12 patients , who wait a year before receiving a new cycle ) . within these repeated cycles ,",
    "clinic visits were scheduled at weeks 1 , 2 and 3 ( at the moment of the injections ) , weeks 5 and 12 , and once again quarterly visits are made to check the cd4 count .",
    "a maximum of 4 cycles within 21 months and a maximum of 3 cycles within 12 months were established , and all patients have been followed up at least 3 months after the last cycle .",
    "cd4 counts were measured at all visits for all patients , while ki67 counts were measured only for the first cycles of the first 12 patients at weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and 12 .    for inspire 3",
    ", patients were randomized into two arms :  r - hil-7 arm \" and  control arm \" with a ratio 3:1 ( 3 r - hil-7 : 1 control ) .",
    "patients of the  r - hil-7 arm \" received the same treatment scheme as patients from inspire 2 .",
    "patients of the  control arm \" were first followed up without receiving the r - hil-7 for one year , and if cd4 count was still below 500 cells/@xmath2l , r - hil-7 treatment was started as for the other group ( thibaut et al [ 17 ] ) .",
    "cd4 counts were measured at all visits .",
    "no ki67 counts measurements were available .",
    "the total duration of the studies was 12 , 24 and 21 months for inspire , inspire 2 and inspire 3 , respectively .",
    "our theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of cd4 and ki67 counts is based on the same system of ordinary differential equations ( ode ) as proposed by thibaut et al [ 16 ] . for patient @xmath6",
    "this model can be written as : @xmath7 \\frac{dp^i}{dt } & = & \\pi^i q^i - \\rho^i p^i - \\mu_p^i p^i \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    the initial condition is assumed to be the equilibrium point ( specified by @xmath8 .",
    "a graphical representation of the system can be found in figure [ fig:2comps ] .",
    "this model includes two state variables : p , the concentration of proliferating cells expressing the ki67 proliferation marker ( cd4@xmath0ki67@xmath0 ) and q , the concentration of quiescent cells ( cd4@xmath0ki67@xmath9 ) .",
    "we have also investigated a model with a feedback term , obtained by multiplying the basic proliferation rate by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a parameter to be estimated .",
    "we did not retain this feedback term because it did not lead to major improvement of the fit while requiring much more computation time ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the vector of parameters of the ode system is @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "these parameters have a biological interpretation : @xmath13 is the production rate , @xmath14 is the reversion rate , @xmath15 is the proliferation rate and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the mortality rates of q and p cells , respectively .",
    "the logarithmic transformation ensures positivity of these biological parameters : @xmath18 .",
    "modeling the variability of the parameters is a crucial ingredient in our model because it allows to have a joint estimation of parameters across the population instead of fitting the model patient - by - patient .",
    "a mixed - effect model can be assumed for each transformed parameter @xmath19 , @xmath19 = 1, ...",
    ",@xmath20 ( here @xmath20 = 5 ) : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the intercept , @xmath23 is a vector of regression coefficients , @xmath24 is a vector of explanatory variables , and @xmath25 are random effects assumed to be independently and identically normally distributed .",
    "thus , the parameters can vary between subjects , but also with time through the time - dependent explanatory variables . in practice , for parsimony ,",
    "random effects and explanatory variables are included for a subset of the parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we present and discuss several of these variability models .",
    "the random effects have been applied on @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath26 , @xmath27 for all the models .",
    "the explanatory variables used are functions of the dose and of the timing of the r - hil-7 injections and are used to model the proliferation rate ( @xmath15 ) and the mortality rate ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these choices are based on many trials and on previous results of the literature ( as in thibaut et al [ 16 ] ) .",
    "we also need a model for the observations .",
    "the state variables @xmath28 are not directly observable ; we only have discrete - time observations of some functions of the components of this vector .",
    "let y@xmath29 and y@xmath30 be the cd4 count and the ki67 count for patient i at time @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the following observation scheme is assumed :    @xmath33    with independently normally distributed measurement errors : @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "note that the times of observations may be different for the two observed components ; indeed there were less observations of ki67 counts than of cd4 counts .",
    "the vector @xmath36 to be estimated includes the intercepts of the biological parameters @xmath37 , the regression coefficients @xmath38 , the variances of the random effects @xmath39 and the variances of the measurement errors @xmath40 . as in guedj",
    "et al [ 18 ] , first the individual likelihoods given the random effects can be computed ; then , the individual likelihoods are computed by integrating over the random effects via the adaptive gaussian quadrature ( genz et al [ 19 ] , pinheiro et al [ 20 ] ) ; the global log - likelihood is the sum of the individual log - likelihoods .",
    "the parameters can then in principle be estimated by maximum likelihood . however , due to identifiability problems , it is useful to adopt an approximate bayesian approach , as in drylewicz et al [ 21 ] .",
    "the prior distribution @xmath41 allows incorporating prior knowledge taken from the literature . in such very complex models mcmc algorithm",
    "generally fail , so we use an approximate bayesian inference , simpler than the inla approach of rue et al [ 22 ] which is also difficult to apply here .",
    "bayes theorem gives @xmath42 ) = l(\\theta ) + \\log [ \\pi(\\theta ) ] + c,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the posterior distribution , @xmath44 is the log - likelihood and c is the normalization constant .",
    "the bernstein - von mises theorem ( van der vaart [ 23 ] ) justifies a normal approximation of the posterior ( nap ) .",
    "the nap can be computed by maximizing the penalized log - likelihood @xmath45 $ ] and computing the inverse of the hessian of @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the nap is @xmath48 .",
    "this computation can be achieved with the nimrod program ( prague et al [ 24 ] ) which uses the so - called rvs algorithm ( commenges et al [ 25 ] ) ; parallel computing is implemented to achieve acceptable computation times .",
    "other approaches have been proposed for fitting ode - based models : ramsay et al [ 26 ] proposed a penalized likelihood approach for the trajectories of the state variables circumventing the need of solving the ode system , but this approach has also numerical issues in presence of random effects ; kuhn et al [ 27 ] have proposed the stochastic approximation expectation maximisation ( saem ) algorithm which can also be used for maximising a log - likelihood or a penalized log - likelihood .",
    "one advantage of the rvs algorithm is the possibility of computing a stringent stopping criterion .",
    "see appendix b for details .      here , we present more than one possible statistical model to describe the effect of r - hil-7 on biological parameters . to compare them , apart direct likelihood comparison and individual fits",
    ", we use an approximate cross - validation criterion , lcva , proposed by commenges et al [ 28 ] .",
    "lcva is an extension of akaike criterion ( aic ) , similar to the general information criterion ( gic ) ( konishi et al [ 29 ] ) that corrects not only for the number of parameters but also for the penalization ; lcva is normalized on the number of observations ( see commenges et al [ 30,31 ] for further developments ) .",
    "this criterion is : @xmath49 \\text{,}\\ ] ] where h@xmath50 is the hessian of minus the log - likelihood .",
    "since lcva estimates a `` risk '' ( cross - entropy or kullback - leibler risk equivalently ) , the smaller the better .",
    "differences in criteria values between two models can be considered as  large \" beyond 0.1 when the response is univariate . however , when the response is multivariate , the threshold for considering a difference as `` large '' should be higher , because lcva , as defined here , is normalized on the number of subjects and does not take into account the number of observations per subject .",
    "firstly , we are interested in estimating the global effect of the first cycle of r - hil-7 . to begin with , only first received cycles for each patient have been considered . as in thibaut",
    "et al [ 16 ] the effect of r - hil-7 is considered to be dose - dependent . in our case , we have chosen a to consider a power of the dose ( as is common in pharmacology ) , that was fixed as 0.25 par profile likelihood ( that is , the fourth root of the dose ) .",
    "the effect on proliferation @xmath15 is taken into account during 7 days ( this time was also fixed by profile likelihood ) after each injection . besides , the effect on the mortality rate @xmath16 is considered to be constant from two days after the first injection during twelve months , followed by a linear decrease during another twelve months .",
    "as already mentioned , random effects are added on the production rate @xmath13 and the reversion rate @xmath14 .",
    "let d@xmath51 the dose received for patient i , and let n@xmath52 the number of injections that patient @xmath6 has received until time @xmath53 .",
    "the statistical description for this first model is as follows :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is an indicator function taking value 1 if an injection has been administrated in the last 7 days , and    @xmath56    taking the same priors as thibaut et al [ 16 ] , we ran the analysis with the nimrod program .",
    "the results are displayed in table [ table : first ] ; r - hil-7 injections increase the proliferation rate ( @xmath15 ) from 0.041 per day at baseline to 0.135 per day during 7 days after each injection ( for the dose equal to 20 @xmath2g / kg ) .",
    "also the estimated mortality rate of q cells decreases from 0.104 per day at baseline to 0.072 during the first year after the treatment .",
    ".[table : first ] priors and estimated mean and standard deviation ( sd ) of all parameters ( in logarithmic and natural scales ) for the  basic \" model when considering only the first cycle for all patients from inspire 1 , 2 @xmath1 3 ; penalized ( p ) and non penalized ( np ) likelihoods , and lcva criteria [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     for the repeated cycles data set , the feedback term leads to an improvement of the lcva criterion .",
    "this may reflect a biological feedback mechanism",
    ". however , this does not modify the cycle effect @xmath57 .",
    "as can be easily verified , both models with and without the feedback term , present no problems regarding the  theoretical \" identifiability ( that depends on the model structure ) but even so , they could present  practical \" identifiability problems as explained in guedj et al [ 18 ] .",
    "in fact , practical identifiability problems are a mix of statistical and numerical problems which are difficult to disentangle ; with scarce information , the variances of the estimators are large , but it comes also with a flat shape of the log - likelihood , making it difficult to maximize .",
    "the difficulty is enhanced by the fact that there are several layers of numerical computation needed to compute the likelihood , leading to an accumulation of numerical errors .    a crucial point in an iterative algorithm",
    "is the stopping criteria . besides the displacement in the parameter space and the variation of the likelihood function ,",
    "another convergence criterion proposed by commenges et al [ 25 ] has been implemented in nimrod .",
    "it is the relative distance to maximum ( rdm ) defined as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the penalized score and @xmath60 is an approximation of the hessian of minus the penalized likelihood .",
    "this criterion can be interpreted as the ratio of the numerical error over the statistical error , and is asymptotically invariant near the maximum to any one - to - one transformation of the parameters .",
    "prague et al [ 24 ] propose 0.1 as a good default value .",

    "<S> the use of dynamical models together with our complex statistical approach allow us to analyze major biological questions . </S>",
    "<S> we found a strong effect of il-7 injections on the proliferation rate ; however , the effect of the third injection of the cycle appears to be much weaker than the first ones . </S>",
    "<S> also , despite a slightly weaker effect of repeated cycles with respect to the initial one , our simulations show the ability of this treatment of maintaining adequate cd4@xmath0 t cells count for years . </S>",
    "<S> we were also able to compare different protocols , showing that cycles of two injections should be sufficient in most cases .    </S>",
