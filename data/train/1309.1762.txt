    "g2 , a recently discovered spatially - extended red source , is on a nearly radial orbit headed towards the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , supermassive black hole at the galactic center , sgr a * @xcite . as g2 plunges towards sgr a * at a supersonic speed",
    ", it will drive a bow shock into the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "as electrons cross the forward shock , they will be accelerated and emit synchrotron radiation . the radio synchrotron emission from the forward shock",
    "has been predicted to be observable by @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted that the radio emission should peak 7 to 9 months before the center of mass crosses periapsis in spring of 2014 , reaching a distance of a mere @xmath3 away from sgr a * @xcite .",
    "this close encounter may give a unique opportunity to probe the accretion disk of sgr a * and the ism near periapsis by measuring the radio flux of the forward bow shock . the radio flux from the forward shock has yet to be observed ; depending on the orbital parameters of g2",
    ", it may not be expected to peak until late summer or early autumn of 2013 , although perhaps @xmath4 of g2 has already passed periapsis @xcite . in this letter , we show that the expected radio flux from the forward shock is model dependent , suggesting an intriguing possibility : the radio flux from the forward shock may reveal the nature of g2 .",
    "the nature of g2 is undetermined .",
    "when first discovered , @xcite hypothesized that g2 was a pressure - confined , non - self - gravitating gas cloud , due to the fact that the brackett - gamma ( br-@xmath5 ) luminosity of g2 is not changing with time , @xmath6 , and the br-@xmath5 velocity dispersion is increasing in a manner that is well fit by a gas cloud with a radius of @xmath7 being tidally sheared by sgr a*. the compactness of g2 necessitates that this gas cloud must have formed shortly before g2 was first discovered in 2002 .",
    "however , there is not a clear source of a gas cloud in the region as the ism at a distance @xmath8 from sgr a * is not susceptible to thermal instabilities .",
    "one possible source of a gas cloud is colliding stellar winds @xcite .",
    "alternatively , there is another class of models where g2 contains a very faint stellar core that emits gas as it falls towards sgr a * @xcite .",
    "the ionized gas is then tidally sheared and is the source of the br-@xmath5 radiation seen as g2 . in @xcite , the ionized gas that is the source of the br-@xmath5 radiation is located in the cold dense inner shock of a momentum - supported bow shock between a stellar wind from a hidden , young star and the hot ism .",
    "@xcite performed hydrodynamical simulations in which they evolved the stellar wind shock in the gravitational potential of sgr a * , and they found that the @xmath9 dispersion observations are well - matched by a star with a mass - loss rate of @xmath10 and with a wind speed of @xmath11 .",
    "the ionization source of the inner shock in this model is not entirely clear , as the predicted br-@xmath5 radiation does not perfectly match the observations .",
    "@xcite proposed that hydrogen is collisionally ionized in the inner shock of the stellar wind , although they overestimated the ionization ability of the wind and underestimated the ionizing background from the o stars in the galactic center .",
    "@xcite just assumed the entire inner shock was ionized , which leads to the br-@xmath5 flux increasing as g2 approaches pericenter , which is not what has been observed .",
    "future work will need to be done to understand the radiation mechanism in the stellar wind model of g2 .",
    "if g2 is a pressure - confined diffuse cloud , then it will likely be destroyed during periapsis passage . if g2 is the inner bow shock of a star it will likely survive @xcite . additionally , if g2 is a cloud , how its size changes as it approaches sgr a * is not clear while the stellar wind model of g2 makes a strong prediction about how the size of the forward bow shock evolves as g2 passes through periapsis .    in the cloud model , as g2 heads closer to sgr a * it will be stretched in the longitudinal direction , compressed in the transverse direction by tidal forces , and compressed further by the increasing pressure of the ism . in the 3-d simulation by @xcite , for an isothermal cloud that formed in 1995.5 with a radius of @xmath12 , they find that the cross sectional area of g2 one year before periapsis shrunk by a factor of 4 to @xmath13 . it appears to be the same size at periapsis .",
    "the cloud is in the process of being completely disrupted , so it is difficult to tell .    in this letter",
    ", we use the term `` cloud model '' to mean a model where the cross section of g2 is approximately constant as it passes through periapsis as in @xcite . in the stellar wind model ,",
    "far away from sgr a * the size of the shock is approximately the same as in the cloud model , but when g2 gets close to periapsis , its size shrinks significantly , inversely proportional to the increase of the pressure of the ism . in other words ,",
    "the area is proportional to the distance from sgr a * squared ( see eq [ eq : areaest ] ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations in @xcite show a similar decrease to the shocked wind area .",
    "the decrease in area at periapsis drastically reduces the expected radio flux .",
    "g2 appears to be an extended object with the compact head structure called g2 , and a less dense and larger tail - like structure , g2 t @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses solely on the over - dense head , g2 , as the origin of g2 t is not well known .",
    "if g2 is a diffuse cloud then g2 t is either material that was stripped from g2 as it fell towards sgr a * , or it was somehow formed through a similar process as g2 . if g2 has a stellar core emitting a wind , the tail may have been from the outflow of the star when it was closer to apocenter .    in this letter",
    ", we extend the work of @xcite to the stellar wind model of g2 .",
    "we apply @xcite analytic solution of the momentum - supported bow shock model proposed by @xcite to estimate the size of the bow shock of g2 .",
    "analytical calculations are better suited to estimate the forward shock size than a hydrodynamic simulation such as @xcite because of stability issues in the simulation .",
    "the ism surrounding sgr a * is convectively unstable .",
    "previous simulations ( with the exception of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) dealt with this issue by evolving a passive tracer field along with g2 and resetting the ism to its equilibrium value whenever a cell did not have a sufficient ratio of tracer particles to ism particles @xcite . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "this stabilization technique suppresses the forward shock in the ism , making these simulations incapable of properly resolving the forward shock .",
    "analytical calculations also allow us to predict how the radio flux depends on the undetermined parameters of the stellar wind .",
    "we use the geometry of the bow shock to calculate the expected synchrotron flux in the radio band of both the outer forward shock and the inner termination shock for the stellar wind model of g2 .",
    "the predicted flux of the forward shock is roughly two orders of magnitude less than the flux predicted by @xcite , and lies an order of magnitude below the quiescent radio emission of sgr a * at 2 ghz . if the stellar wind model is correct , g2 will likely not be observable in radio frequencies .",
    "therefore , a radio detection of g2 will shed light on the nature of g2 well before periapsis passage .    in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] of this letter , we briefly describe the model we used for the ism at the galactic center as well as the geometry of the bow shock . in section [ sec : results ] we show how the expected peak synchrotron flux at 1.4 ghz and spectrum depend on the nature of g2 . in section [ sec : s2 ] we extend our results to the star s2 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we briefly discuss our findings .",
    "for the hot ism environment surrounding sgr a * , we adopt the same dependence of density and temperature on distance @xmath14 from sgr a * as those used by @xcite , who used the model of @xcite . however , the most recent _ chandra _ x - ray observations of the galactic centre suggest that the radial density profile may be flatter than the one used by schartmann et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath15 @xmath16 throughout this paper the convention @xmath17 is used , and unless otherwise noted all units are cgs . to calculate the distance and velocity of g2 , we use the orbital parameters derived from the br-@xmath5 observations given in @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of illustration g2 s velocity is well matched by a free fall approximation , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath18 .",
    "the mach number is approximately @xmath19 . because of the approximation we made to the velocity",
    ", the mach number has no time dependence , but it will change with time when using the proper elliptical motion of the orbit .      to calculate the radio flux from the forward bow shock of g2 , we need to determine the area of its cylindrical cross section .",
    "we use the same parameters for the isothermal stellar wind as in @xcite : a star with a mass - loss rate of @xmath20 , a constant wind speed of @xmath21 , and a temperature of @xmath22 .",
    "we include the dependence of our results on the stellar wind parameters as they are not precisely constrained by observations .",
    "the wind is supersonic , with a mach number of @xmath23 . to calculate the properties of a stellar wind bow shock",
    ", we used the equations given in @xcite instead of @xcite because @xcite correctly accounts for the centrifugal force due to the fluid moving in a curved path inside of the shock .",
    "the effect of the centrifugal force is to produce a larger bow shock , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , than the solution given in @xcite ( see figure [ fig : area ] for a comparison ) .",
    "the stagnation radius , @xmath24 , is the same in both solutions and it occurs where the two ram pressures equal one another , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath25 . for the adopted parameters of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath28 the shock is axisymmetric about the stellar velocity vector , and the distance of the bow - shock surface from the star depends on the azimuthal angle measured from the stagnation point , @xmath29 , and can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is given as an analytical function in @xcite , @xmath32 the velocity of the gas inside of the bow shock is tangential to the shock surface and equal to @xmath33 the strength of the outer shock depends on the angle @xmath29 .",
    "the shock will terminate at an angle , @xmath34 , where the normal component of the velocity of the ism with respect to the star , @xmath35 , is equal to the sound speed of the ism .",
    "as in @xcite , it is useful to define the following angles : @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , so that @xmath38",
    ". then @xmath39 is found by solving @xmath40 . when @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the cylindrical cross - section area of the forward shock is @xmath44 @xmath45 has some degree of uncertainty from modeling the galactic center , and the fact that the inclination of g2 s trajectory with respect to a possible accretion disk of sgr a * is unknown .",
    "the change in the area can be estimated using @xmath46 , when @xmath47 .",
    "the cross - sectional area versus time is plotted in figure [ fig : area ] .",
    "the area in the wind models decreases by @xmath48 orders of magnitude as g2 approaches periapsis .",
    "synchrotron flux is expected to peak at periapsis where the magnetic field is strongest .",
    "the decrease in the area of the forward shock as g2 approaches periapsis is responsible for the large difference in flux for the pressure - confined cloud and stellar wind models .    , the cross - sectional area of the inner shock of g2 , which agrees very well with the simulation by @xcite .",
    "the thick red line is the area used in @xcite , @xmath49 cm . ]",
    "to calculate the expected synchrotron emission of the forward shock of g2 we extend the methodology of @xcite to the stellar wind model of g2 , who used particle - in - cell simulations of low mach number shocks to estimate the electron population accelerated by g2 . as in @xcite , we assume that a fraction @xmath50 of the electrons swept into the forward shock are accelerated to a high - energy power law spectrum with a slope of @xmath51 and that has a minimum lorentz factor @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the preshock temperature . @xmath55 and @xmath56 were empirically determined by @xcite with simulations .",
    "they found @xmath55 and @xmath56 to be nearly independent of @xmath54 and @xmath45 .",
    "it may be counter - intuitive that the injection energy of the power law spectrum depends on the preshocked rather than shocked temperature , but because of the very narrow range of @xmath45 applicable to g2 and considered by @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 , it makes little difference which temperature one chooses ( as long as @xmath56 is adjusted accordingly ) .",
    "the energy distribution of the rate at which electrons enter the shock is given by @xcite , @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath54 are all functions of time .",
    "to calculate the expected radio flux , we assume that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the pressure of the unshocked ism to calculate the unshocked magnetic field .",
    "the shocked magnetic field is calculated assuming only shock compression with no additional amplification of the magnetic field , as expected for small mach number shocks .",
    "we use the rankine - hugoniot jump conditions of an adiabatic shock to find the shocked magnetic field from @xcite , @xmath65 when @xmath66 , @xmath67 . as an upper limit on @xmath68 ,",
    "we make sure that the shocked magnetic pressure does not exceed the ram pressure of the ism , this is true for all mach numbers if @xmath69 .",
    "we take @xmath70 , which corresponds to the trajectory with largest flux at 1.4 ghz in @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron specific luminosity at the frequency @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the number of electrons with @xmath74 at time @xmath75 .",
    "the observed flux is calculated using a distance to the galactic center of @xmath76 : @xmath77    to calculate the flux , we extend the two scenarios defined in @xcite to a bow shock with changing area which starts accelerating electrons at sometime @xmath78 and the forward shock reaches periapsis at @xmath79 .",
    "the two models are ( 1 ) the plow model , where every electron that enters the shock stays in the shocked area and radiates in the shocked magnetic field , and ( 2 ) the local model , where the electrons are energized by the shock but then they quickly exit the shock and radiate _ in situ _ in the unshocked local magnetic field .    in the plow model , the flux at 1.4 ghz is calculated from eq ( [ eq : flux ] ) using the area from eq ( [ eq : area ] ) and the shocked magnetic field , eq ( [ eq : bshocked ] ) . when @xmath80 , @xmath81 is @xmath82 where @xmath60 is the instantaneous bow shock area at time @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath83 , @xmath81 is @xmath84 in the local model , the flux is calculated with the unshocked magnetic field @xmath85 the light curves of the flux at 1.4 ghz in the stellar wind model of g2 are shown near pericenter passage of the forward shock in the inset of figure [ fig : lightcurves ] . the light curves in the stellar wind model peak shortly after @xmath79 as in the cloud model of @xcite . to compare the expected fluxes from the stellar wind and cloud models , we also calculate the expected flux using a constant area of @xmath86 in equations ( [ eq : cbefore ] ) and ( [ eq : goodlocal ] ) .",
    "the light curves close to pericenter of both the cloud and stellar wind models are plotted in figure [ fig : lightcurves ] .    to see how our results depend on our parameter choices , we estimate @xmath73 in both the plow and local models by multiplying @xmath87 by the dynamical time ( @xmath88 ) and using the area from eq ( [ eq : areaest ] ) . @xmath89",
    "then the flux at 1.4 ghz when @xmath80 is estimated using eq ( [ eq : flux ] ) with magnetic fields from eq ( [ eq : b ] ) and ( [ eq : bshocked ] ) for the local and plow model respectively @xmath90    the analytical results given by equations ( [ eq : localest ] ) and ( [ eq : plowest ] ) are found to be within a factor of 2 from the numerical results in figure [ fig : lightcurves ] .    , for different models of g2 .",

    "the dashed lines correspond to the local model , where the electrons quickly leave the bow shock region after being accelerated .",
    "thick red lines correspond to when g2 is a cloud with an area of @xmath91 as in @xcite .",
    "the lower blue lines represent when g2 is a stellar wind with an area calculated using eq ( [ eq : area ] ) .",
    "the dotted blue line is the flux from electrons residing in the inner shock of the stellar wind assuming a steady state solution .",
    "_ inset _ : a plot showing the flux at 1.4 ghz in jy for a stellar wind model of g2 in a linear scale . ]      in the stellar wind model of g2 , electrons will be accelerated at both the outer , forward shock traveling into the ism as well as at the inner , termination shock of the stellar wind . for the inner shock to radiate at 1.4 ghz",
    ", it must be able to accelerate electrons from a upstream temperature of @xmath92 ev to @xmath93 ev .",
    "it is not clear whether a non - relativistic shock with @xmath94 will be capable of doing this efficiently .",
    "therefore , our estimation of the radio flux from the inner shock in this section should be taken as an upper limit .",
    "we find the flux at 1.4 ghz lies four orders of magnitude below the fluxes calculated in the previous section .",
    "therefore the inner shock will not contribute to the radio synchrotron flux of g2 .",
    "the stellar wind at the bow shock is much more dense than the ism , its density equal to @xmath95 the shocked gas will radiate efficiently and cool quickly , and therefore the shock can be taken to be isothermal .",
    "so @xmath96 will be boosted by a factor @xmath97 : @xmath98 assuming that in the shocked wind @xmath99 , @xmath100 , the magnetic field inside of the inner shock is @xmath101 we calculate the volume of the inner shock by assuming that it is in steady state . in a steady state ,",

    "our estimate underpredicts the more accurate calculation of the inner shock radio flux at periapsis by a factor @xmath112 .",
    "the radio flux from the inner shock lies well below the forward shock and can be ignored .      , where @xmath79 is the periapsis crossing time of the forward shock .",
    "the color scheme is the same as figure [ fig : lightcurves ] , where solid lines correspond to the plow model , and dashed lines to the local model .",
    "thick red lines represent the spectra if g2 is a cloud , while the lower blue lines are if g2 is a stellar wind .",
    "the data points are radio fluxes measured during periods of inactivity of sgr a * by @xcite . ]    in figure [ fig : spectra ] we show the spectra expected from forward shock at 0.05 years after periapsis of the forward shock .",
    "to calculate the synchrotron self absorption frequency in the plowing models , we simply use the surface area of the forward shock at time @xmath113 years , accounting for the geometry of the bow shock in the stellar wind model . in the local models",
    ", we use the same approach as @xcite , where synchrotron self absorption frequency and @xmath114 are calculated separately for each time step @xmath115 up until @xmath113 yr , and then the fluxes are summed .",
    "the surface area of the radiation in the local model is @xmath116 , where @xmath117 cm in the cloud model and is @xmath118 in the stellar wind model .",
    "the radio flux in the stellar wind model lies below the quiescent flux of sgr a * at all frequencies and therefore will likely not be observable .",
    "there is a cluster of young stars at the galactic center , and one of the brightest of these stars s2 , a b type star that has an orbital period of 15.5 years , reaches nearly twice as close to sgr a * as g2 ( a distance of @xmath119 ) @xcite .",
    "s2 is expected to have a strong wind which will form a momentum - supported bow shock similar to g2 in the stellar wind model .",
    "the x - ray radiation from the inner shock was investigated by @xcite , who estimated the s2 s wind has a mass - loss rate @xmath120 and a velocity @xmath121 km / s . using these parameters , we estimate peak radio flux at periapsis from the electrons accelerated by the outer shock of s2 using eq ( [ eq : plowest ] ) .",
    "we estimate that the peak flux from the forward shock of s2 at 1.4 ghz is @xmath122 jy and @xmath123 jy at 14 ghz ( assuming @xmath51 ) .",
    "the last pericenter crossing of s2 was in 2002.3 and there is good data of sgr a * around this time .",
    "the flux at 15 ghz varies from @xmath1240.81.1 jy and the flux at 23 ghz varies from @xmath1240.81.2 jy @xcite .",
    "while there is variability in the radio flux before and after the pericenter crossing of s2 , there is not a flare that lasts for a long time or is spectrally consistent with synchrotron radiation from s2 . throughout the pericenter crossing time the flux at 23",
    "ghz is equal to or larger than the flux at 15 ghz , while the opposite would be expected from the synchrotron radiation of an electron power - law distribution with @xmath51 .",
    "thus it is likely this variation is due to intrinsic variation of sgr a * and not due to s2 .",
    "the lack of detection of the forward shock of s2 in 2002.3 gives us additional confidence in our prediction that the forward - shock of g2 will not be observable in the radio band .",
    "in this paper we calculated the expected radio flux from the forward shock and reverse shock of g2 assuming that g2 is the inner bow shock of a stellar wind as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we used an analytic solution of a momentum - supported bow shock to calculate the geometry of the forward shock and provide analytical estimates of the flux at 1.4 ghz at pericenter passage of the forward and reverse shock to show how the flux depends on the undetermined parameters of the stellar wind .",
    "if g2 is the inner shock of a stellar wind , its forward shock cylindrical cross section will decrease as g2 approaches sgr a * and the ram pressure increases , driving the stagnation point to a smaller distance from the star .",
    "the decrease in area by over two orders of magnitude of results in a similar decrease in the radio flux expected at periapsis , falling well below the previous estimates of @xmath1241 - 20 jy predicted by @xcite , where they assumed that g2 was a gas cloud that formed in pressure equilibrium and that the cross section area stayed constant .",
    "if g2 is the inner bow shock from a stellar wind , the radio flux from the forward shock lies below the quiescent radio emission of sgr a * at all frequencies , so it will be difficult to detect .",
    "if g2 is a pressure - supported gas cloud , it will likely be destroyed during pericenter passage ; on the other hand g2 will survive if it is the inner bow shock of a stellar wind . therefore whether or not g2 survives will be important in determining the makeup of g2 .",
    "however , the radio emission will peak when the forward shock crosses periapsis , which in the cloud model is predicted to happen 7 to 9 months before g2 passes through periapsis .",
    "we have shown that the stellar wind model makes a very different prediction of the radio synchrotron flux of g2 , so the radio flux will be an important early clue about the nature of g2 ."
