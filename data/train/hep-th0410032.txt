    "the gauge theoretical formulation of the low dimensional gravity models , like the jackiw - teitelboim model @xcite , is based on the cartan - einstein vielbein or the moving frame method . in terms of these variables in 1 + 1 dimensions one deals with so called bf gauge theory and the zero curvature equations of motion , providing a link with soliton equations @xcite .",
    "but in these variables , as the `` square root '' of the pseudo - riemannian metric , the soliton equations have dissipative form , this is why we called them the dissipative solitons or dissipatons @xcite .",
    "the dissipative version of the nonlinear schrodinger equation with a rich resonance dynamics @xcite is a couple of nonlinear heat and anti - heat equations , which we called the reaction - diffusion system ( rd ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dissipaton of that system is the pair of two real functions , one of which is exponentially growing , and another decaying , in space and time .",
    "but the product of these two functions has the perfect soliton form .",
    "as recently realized @xcite , if dissipatons of rd evolves with additional time variable according to the next member after rd of sl(2,r ) akns hierarchy , with cubic dispersion , then this product can be considered as a soliton of 2 + 1 dimensional kadomtsev - petviashvili equation with negative dispersion ( kp - ii ) . this way the resonance behaviour of kp - ii solitons was found in terms of dissipatons of the 1 + 1 dimensional models . moreover , in this approach , the novel two resonance soliton of kp - ii with four virtual solitons was constructed and interpreted as the degenerate four soliton solution @xcite .    from another site , as was shown before @xcite , dissipative version of the derivative nonlinear schrodinger equations ( dnls ) also admits dissipative soliton solutions with resonance interaction @xcite .",
    "moreover , these resonances show the chirality properties , propagating only in one direction . in the present paper , following the strategy of paper @xcite , by the recursion operator of the kaup - newell ( kn ) hierarchy , first we construct the next dissipative system of the hierarchy with cubic dispersion . then , using these two members of sl(2,r ) kaup - newell hierarchy , we show that the product of dissipaton functions is solution of the modified kadomtsev - petviashvili equation with negative dispersion ( mkp - ii ) ( section 2 ) . in section 3 bilinearization of the two flows",
    "allows us to find bilinear form for mkp - ii .",
    "chiral resonance dissipatons of drd and their geometrical meaning are considered in section 4 .",
    "one and two soliton solutions of mkp - ii are constructed in section 5 .",
    "we show the resonance character of these solitons interaction and the chirality property posing restriction on the soliton collision angles . in conclusion",
    "we discuss main results of this paper .",
    "the kn hierarchy has the form @xcite @xmath0 where the operator @xmath1 is the first symplectic form , while @xmath2 is the recursion operator of the hierarchy , and @xmath3 .",
    "the second flow of the hierarchy is the system @xmath4,\\eqno(2.4a)\\ ] ] @xmath5,\\eqno(2.4b)\\ ] ] while the third one is @xmath6_x,\\eqno(2.5a)\\ ] ] @xmath7_x,\\eqno(2.5b)\\ ] ] for the sl(2,r ) case of kn hierarchy we have real time variables @xmath8 which we denote as @xmath9 , and @xmath10 . in this case functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 are real , and we denote them as @xmath13 then we have the drd system @xcite @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17    now we consider the pair of functions of three variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 satisfying the systems ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) .",
    "these systems are compatible since they belong to the same hierarchy for different times .",
    "this can be also checked directly from compatibility condition @xmath20 by using following conservation laws for eqs.(2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) respectively @xmath21_x , \\eqno(2.9)\\ ] ] @xmath22_x\\ ] ]    * proposition 1*. let the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are solutions of the systems ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) simultaneously .",
    "then , the function @xmath23 satisfies the modified kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( mkp - ii ) @xmath24 or written in another form @xmath25 @xmath26 ( the second form appears from the first one by introducing auxiliary variable @xmath27 according to eq.(2.11b ) and integration in variable @xmath28 ) .",
    "the proof is straightforward . from definition of @xmath29 and eqs(2.7),(2.9 ) we have @xmath30_x , \\eqno(2.12)\\ ] ] @xmath31_x\\ ] ] from another site eqs.(2.8),(2.9 ) give @xmath32_x \\eqno(2.13)\\ ] ] @xmath33_{xx } \\eqno(2.14)\\ ] ] first we combine eqs.(2.12 ) and ( 2.14 ) to cancel term @xmath34 , then use eq.(2.12 ) to exclude @xmath35 and its derivative , according to @xmath36 and integrating once @xmath37 as a result we arrive with the mkp - ii ( 2.10 )",
    "now we will construct bilinear representation for systems ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) to find solutions of mkp - ii according to our proposition 1 . in our paper",
    "@xcite we applied the hirota bilinear method to integrate rdr ( 2.7 ) .",
    "now we will apply the same method to eq.(2.8 ) and mkp - ii . as was noticed in @xcite , the standard hirota substitution as the ratio of two functions does nt work directly for @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "( this fact also is related with complicated analytical structure of dnls @xcite ) . to have the standard hirota substitution , following @xcite we first rewrite the systems ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) in terms of new functions @xmath40 , @xmath41 : @xmath42 and as result we have the systems @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46    then , due to the fact that @xmath47 the systems ( 3.2 ) , ( 3.3 ) provide also solution of mkp - ii which we can formulate as below .",
    "* proposition 2*. let the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are solutions of the systems ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) simultaneously .",
    "then , the function @xmath50 satisfies the modified kadomtsev - petviashvili equation ( mkp - ii ) ( 2.10 ) or ( 2.11 ) .    to solve the systems ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) we introduce four real functions @xmath51 according to the formulas @xmath52 or using eqs.(3.1 ) and ( 3.4 ) for the original variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 we have the following substitution @xmath53 then the system ( 3.2 ) bilinearizes in the form @xmath54",
    "@xmath55 @xmath56 in a similar way , for the system ( 3.3 ) we have the next bilinear form @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 comparing these two bilinear forms we can see that the second and the third equations in both systems ( 3.7),(3.8 ) are of the same form .",
    "this is why for simultaneous solution of both eqs.(3.2 ) , ( 3.3 ) we have the next bilinear system @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 > from the last equation we have @xmath64 which provides for solution of mkp - ii the following formula @xmath65",
    "first of all we consider drd ( 2.7 ) as an evolution equation where @xmath66 is interpreted as the time variable .      for one dissipaton solution we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the regularity requires that we choose conditions @xmath69 and @xmath70 so that we have dissipaton @xmath71 with solitonic density @xmath72 in the last equation we introduced the dissipaton s amplitude and velocity , @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspondingly , in terms of which the above conditions mean that velocity of dissipaton is bounded from below by @xmath75 .",
    "it is worth noting that in contrast with dissipatons of rd system @xcite , in our case no critical value from above for dissipaton s velocity exists .    for the mass and momentum densities we have @xmath76 @xmath77 which allows one calculate the corresponding conserved quantities",
    "@xmath78 due to relation @xmath79 the mass @xmath80 is positive . rewriting momentum in the canonical form @xmath81",
    ", we find for the effective mass @xmath82 .",
    "the model has geometrical interpretation of two dimensional pseudo - riemannian spacetime with constant scalar curvature @xmath83 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this model is known as the jackiw - teitelboim gravity @xcite .",
    "it admits gauge theoretical formulation as the bf theory .",
    "the gauge potentials are cartan - einstein zweibein fields @xmath84 , so that the metric is @xmath85 , and the spin - connection @xmath86 , ( @xmath87 )",
    ". then equations of motion @xmath88    @xmath89    where @xmath90 , have meaning of torsionless and the constant curvature conditions respectively .",
    "we fix the gauge freedom and the corresponding evolution by the following conditions on lagrange multipliers @xmath91 and spin connections @xmath92 then after the identification @xmath93 the system ( 4.8 ) , ( 4.9 ) reduces to drd ( 2.7 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that in contrast to the rd @xcite in our case the scalar curvature disappears from equations of motion but is still present in the linear problem .",
    "moreover it has the meaning of the squared spectral parameter @xmath94 .",
    "the metric tensor component @xmath95 in terms of transformed variables ( 3.1 ) is given by @xmath96 calculating it for one dissipaton ( 4.2 ) we find that event horizon @xmath97 exists only for the bounded velocity @xmath98 at the distance @xmath99 in contrast to the rd @xcite dissipaton with two symmetrical event horizons reflecting two directions of motion , we have now only one directional motion and call the corresponding single event horizon as the _ chiral event horizon_.",
    "now we consider a solution of the system ( 3.9 ) , giving 2 + 1 dimensional solution of mkp - ii . for one - soliton solution we have @xmath100 where , @xmath101 .",
    "the regularity condition requires @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "then we have @xmath104 where @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and bounded from the below parameter @xmath107 is positive @xmath108 .",
    "the geometrical meaning of this parameter is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the slope of the soliton line . due to the condition @xmath108 , the direction of this line is restricted between @xmath111 .",
    "( this is the space analog of the chirality property of dissipaton in 1 + 1 dimensions for dnls [ 7 ] , when it propagates only in one direction . )",
    "the velocity of soliton is two dimensional vector @xmath112 , where @xmath113 , directed at angle @xmath114 to the soliton line , where @xmath115 . when @xmath116 , the velocity of soliton is orthogonal to the soliton line .    for two soliton solution we have    @xmath117    @xmath118    where @xmath119 , @xmath120 and    @xmath121",
    "@xmath122    @xmath123 the regularity conditions now are the same as for one soliton @xmath124 , @xmath125 . then this solution describes a collision of two solitons propagating in plane and at some value of parameters creating the resonance states ( fig.1a , b ) .",
    "in the present paper we have constructed virtual soliton resonance solutions for mkp - ii in terms of dissipative solitons of 1 + 1 dimensional equations as the derivative reaction - diffusion equation and its higher member of sl(2,r ) kaup - newell hierarchy .",
    "the difference with the kp - ii resonance is in the additional restrictions on solitons angles from regularity conditions .",
    "when this paper has been finished , on the conference on nonlinear physics in gallipoli , italy , june - july 2004 , konopelchenko attracted our attention to the relations between mkp equation and 1 + 1 dimensional models by the symmetry reduction of 2 + 1 dimensional models @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but in paper @xcite a relation of mkp only with burgers hierarchy has been established . while paper @xcite relates mkp with derivative nls in the nakamura - chen form but not in the kaup - newell form .",
