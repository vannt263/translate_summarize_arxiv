    "a second strongly coupled sector in nature akin to qcd is a likely possibility .",
    "the new strong interaction may naturally break the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry through the formation of a chiral condensate , thus making the standard model ( sm ) higgs a composite particle . models of this type are called ` technicolor ' ( tc ) @xcite and several new variants have been proposed recently @xcite with interesting dynamics relevant for collider phenomenology @xcite as well as cosmology @xcite .",
    "a review of these models and the phase diagram of strongly coupled theories can be found in ref .",
    "a relevant point is that the technicolor dynamics is strongly modified by the new interactions necessary to give masses to sm fermions @xcite and the interplay between these two sectors leads to an entirely new class of models , constraints on which were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we discuss different possibilities for dark matter ( dm ) candidates within this rich framework and show that some of these composite states can be thermal relics while being sufficiently light to be produced at the lhc .",
    "we call dark matter candidates composed of technicolor fields ` technicolor interacting massive particles ' ( timps ) and focus on those which are pseudo nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb ) .",
    "our analysis is general since we use a low energy effective description for the timps which can easily be adapted for specific models .",
    "we will discuss some of these models @xcite which provide particularly interesting candidates for dark matter .",
    "an interesting class of timps arise from _ partially gauged technicolor _",
    "models @xcite in which only part of the tc group is gauged under the ew interactions .",
    "the ew gauged technifermions are organized in doublets in the usual way while the other technifermions are collectively denoted @xmath2 , with @xmath3 counting these flavors only : @xmath4 these models were introduced originally in order to yield the smallest nave ew @xmath5 parameter , while still being able to achieve walking dynamics .",
    "-parameter from a loop of technifermions counts the number of fermion doublets transforming under weak @xmath6 , while walking dynamics is required to reduce non - perturbative contributions to the full @xmath5-parameter .",
    "the nave @xmath5-parameter has recently been conjectured to be the absolute lower bound of the full @xmath5-parameter @xcite , making the tc models presented here optimal with respect to satisfying the lep precision data . ]",
    "the non - minimal flavor symmetry of the resulting model allows for a number of light states accessible at colliders .",
    "a similar scenario is envisaged in so - called _ conformal technicolor _",
    "the technifermions not gauged under the ew interactions essentially constitute a strongly interacting _",
    "hidden sector_.    to be specific we consider a scalar timp , @xmath7 , made of the sm gauge singlet technifermions @xmath2 and possessing a global @xmath8 symmetry protecting the lightest state against decay",
    ". moreover we take @xmath9 to be a pngb from the breaking of chiral symmetry in the hidden sector , which leaves this @xmath8 unbroken .",
    "this constitutes the simplest type of timp from the point of view of its interactions so we study this first and consider later timps with constituents charged under the sm .",
    "an explicit model of partially gauged technicolor featuring this kind of timp is ` ultra minimal technicolor ' ( umt ) @xcite .",
    "we therefore identify our dm candidate with a complex scalar @xmath10 , singlet under sm interactions and charged under a new @xmath8 symmetry ( _ not _ the usual technibaryon symmetry ) , which makes it stable .",
    "in addition to the timp we consider a light ( composite ) higgs boson . a general effective lagrangian to describe this situation is presented below and can be derived , for any specific model , from the umt lagrangian @xcite . at low energies we can describe the interactions of @xmath10 through a chiral lagrangian .",
    "the ( composite ) higgs @xmath11 couples to the timp as : @xmath12 the interactions between technihadrons such as @xmath10 made of ew singlet constituents and states with ew charged constituents ( e.g. @xmath11 ) are due mainly to tc dynamics and , as such , the couplings between these two sectors are _ not _ suppressed @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath10 is a pngb it must have either derivative couplings or the non - derivative couplings must vanish in the limit @xmath13 .",
    "the mass @xmath14 is assumed to come from interactions beyond the tc sector , e.g. ` extended technicolor ' ( etc ) @xcite which can provide masses for the tc nambu - goldstone bosons , as well as for sm fermions .",
    "the couplings @xmath15 are dimensionless and expected to be of @xmath16 , while @xmath17 is the scale @xmath18 below which the derivative expansion is sensible .",
    "we emphasize the differences between a composite scalar timp and _ fundamental _ scalar dark matter considered earlier @xcite : i ) the @xmath8 is natural , i.e. it is identified with a global symmetry ( not necessarily the technibaryon one ) , ii ) its pngb nature makes the dm candidate naturally light with respect to the ew scale and influences the structure of its couplings , iii ) compositeness requires the presence around the ew scale of spin-1 resonances in addition to the timp and the ( composite ) higgs ; their interplay can lead to striking collider signatures @xcite .",
    "when the timp is a composite state made of particles charged under the ew interactions it becomes a good candidate for _ asymmetric _ dark matter , i.e. its present abundance is due to a relic asymmetry between the particle and its antiparticle , just as for baryons . this has been the case usually considered when discussing tc dm candidates @xcite since the technibaryon self - annihilation cross - section , obtained by scaling the proton - antiproton annihilation cross - section up to the ew scale , is high enough to essentially erase any symmetric thermal relic abundance . hence an asymmetry between technibaryons and anti - technibaryons",
    "is invoked , especially as this can be generated quite naturally in the same manner as for baryons .",
    "however , scaling up the proton - antiproton annihilation cross - section is not applicable to generic timps , in particular not to pngbs , hence they may have an interesting _ symmetric _ ( thermal ) relic abundance .",

    "we see that annihilations proceed via the ( composite ) higgs into sm fermions and gauge bosons pairs , as well as into a pair of ( composite ) higgs particles . as discussed in refs.@xcite , we can rewrite the continuity equation ( [ continuity ] ) in terms of the dimensionless quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the specific entropy determining the value of the adiabat @xmath27 : @xmath28 , \\\\ \\nonumber \\mbox{where , } \\quad \\lambda & \\equiv & \\left(\\frac{g_s^4}{180\\pi}\\right)^{1/6}\\ ,   m_\\phi\\,m_{\\rm p}\\,{\\langle\\sigma_{\\rm ann}\\,v \\rangle}\\,g_\\rho^{1/2}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath29 counts the number of relativistic degrees of freedom contributing to the energy density , which determines the hubble expansion rate @xmath30 .",

    ", the particle abundance initially tracks its equilibrium value but when the temperature falls below its mass and it becomes non - relativistic , its equilibrium abundance falls exponentially due to the boltzmann factor .",
    "hence so does the annihilation rate , eventually becoming sufficiently small that the ( comoving ) particle abundance becomes constant . defining the parameter @xmath33",

    "this gives a good match to the exact numerical solution of eq.([yseqn ] ) for the choice @xmath37 which corresponds to the epoch when the annihilation rate , @xmath38 , equals the logarithmic rate of change of the particle abundance itself : @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "note that the usual criterion of equating the annihilation rate to the hubble expansion rate @xmath30 would give an _ erroneous _",

    "we also take the dimensionless effective couplings to the ( composite ) higgs to be of @xmath44 and define @xmath45 , @xmath46 , since at low energies the @xmath47 and @xmath48 terms contribute very nearly equally , as do the @xmath49 and @xmath50 terms .",
    "there are spikes in @xmath40 at the ( composite ) higgs resonance when @xmath51 , however the simple approximation above is not reliable near such a resonance @xcite and we must then solve the full continuity equation including the ( composite ) higgs width .",

    "as discussed below , in the presence of an asymmetry the total relic abundance always increases relative to the same model with no asymmetry , so @xmath0 provides a general _ lower _ bound for the mass of the pngb timps we consider .",
