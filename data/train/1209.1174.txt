    "cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation is one of the most ancient fossils of the universe .",
    "the observations of the nasa wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite on the cmb temperature and polarization anisotropies have put tight constraints on the cosmological parameters @xcite . in addition , some anomalies in cmb field have also been reported soon after the release of the wmap data ( see @xcite as a review ) . among these ,",
    "an extremely cold spot ( cs ) centered at galactic coordinate ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) with a characteristic scale about @xmath4 was detected in the spherical mexican hat wavelet ( smhw ) non - gaussian analyses @xcite .",
    "compared with the distribution derived from the isotropic and gaussian cmb simulations , due to this cs , the smhw coefficients of wmap data have an excess of kurtosis @xcite .",
    "in addition , several non - gaussian statistics , such as the amplitude and area of the cold spot , the higher criticism and so on , have also been applied to identify this wmap cs @xcite . since then , various alternative explanations for the cs have been proposed , including the possible foregrounds @xcite , sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite , the supervoid in the universe @xcite , and the cosmic texture @xcite . in order to distinguish different interpretations , some analyses have been carried out , such as the non - gaussian tests for the different detectors and different frequency channels of wmap satellite @xcite , the investigation of the nvss sources @xcite , the survey around the cs with megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope @xcite , the redshift survey using vimos on vlt towards cs @xcite , and the cross - correlation between wmap and faraday depth rotation map @xcite .",
    "nearly all the interpretations of cs are related to the local characters of the cmb field , so the studies on the local properties of cs are necessary . in this paper",
    ", we shall propose a set of novel non - gaussian statistics , i.e. the local mean temperature , variance , skewness and kurtosis , to study the local properties of the cmb field . by altering the radium of the cap around cs , we study the local properties of cs at different scales .",
    "compared with the _ coldest spots _ in the random gaussian simulations , we find the local non - gaussianity of wmap cs , i.e. it deviates from gaussianity at @xmath0 significant level .",
    "furthermore , we find the significant difference between wmap cs and gaussian simulations at all the scales @xmath5 .    to study the possible origin of wmap cs , we have also compared it with the spots at the same position of the simulated gaussian samples .",
    "we find that different from the general properties of the foregrounds , the point sources or various local contaminations , in the small scales the local variance , skewness and kurtosis values of cs are not significantly large , except for its coldness in temperature .",
    "however , after the careful comparison with gaussian simulations , we find that when @xmath1 the local variance and skewness are systematically large .",
    "this implies that cs prefers a large - scale non - gaussian structure . in order to confirm it ,",
    "we repeat the analyses adopted by many authors , where the statistics of temperature and kurtosis in smhw domain are used .",
    "we apply these analyses to the wmap data with different @xmath6 , and find that nearly all the non - gaussianities of cs are encoded in the low multipoles @xmath7 .",
    "it was claimed that the cosmic texture seemed to be the most promising explanation @xcite , by investigating the temperature and area of cs . in order to check this explanation by our local statistics ,",
    "we superimpose a similar cosmic texture into the simulated gaussian samples , and calculate the local statistics of the cmb fields .",
    "we find that the excesses of the local statistics of wmap cs can be excellently explained by this non - gaussian structure .",
    "so our local analyses of the cs supports the cosmic texture explanation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the wmap data , which will be used in the analyses . in section 3 ,",
    "we define the local statistics and apply them to wmap data . in section 4 , the dependence of the wmap non - gaussianities on the value of @xmath6 are studied , which shows that the non - gaussian signals are all encoded in the low multipoles .",
    "section 5 summarizes the main results of this paper .",
    "in our analyses , we shall use the wmap data including the vw7 map , ilc7 map and nilc5 map .",
    "the cmb temperature maps derived from the wmap observations are pixelized in healpix format with the total number of pixels @xmath8 . in our analyses",
    ", we use the 7-year wmap data for v and w frequency bands with @xmath9 . the linearly co - added map ( written as  vw7 \" )",
    "is constructed by using an inverse weight of the pixel - noise variance @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the pixel noise for each differential assembly ( da ) and @xmath12 represents the full - sky average of the effective number of observations for each pixel .",
    "the wmap instrument is composed of 10 das spanning five frequencies from 23 to 94 ghz @xcite .",
    "the internal linear combination ( ilc ) method has been used by wmap team to generate the wmap ilc maps @xcite .",
    "the 7-year ilc ( written as  ilc7 \" ) map is a weighted combination from all five original frequency bands , which are smoothed to a common resolution of one degree . for the 5-year wmap data , in @xcite",
    "the authors have made a higher resolution cmb ilc map ( written as  nilc5 \" ) , an implementation of a constrained linear combination of the channels with minimum error variance on a frame of spherical called needlets . in this paper",
    ", we will also consider both these ilc maps for the analysis .",
    "note that all these wmap data have the same resolution parameter @xmath9 , and the corresponding total pixel number @xmath13 .    in comparison with wmap observations to give constraints on the statistics , a @xmath14 cosmological model is assumed with the parameters given by the wmap 7-year best - fit values @xcite : @xmath15",
    ", @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 at @xmath21 .",
    "we simulate the cmb maps for each frequency channel by considering the wmap beam resolution and instrument noise , and then co - add them with inverse weight of the full - sky averaged pixel - noise variance in each frequency to get the simulated vw7 maps .",
    "similar to the previous work @xcite , to simulate the ilc7 map , we ignore the noises and smooth the simulated map with one degree resolution . and for nilc5 , we consider the noise level and beam window function given in @xcite . in all the random gaussian simulations ,",
    "we assume that the temperature fluctuations and instrument noise follow the gaussian distribution , and do not consider any effect due to the residual foreground contaminations .",
    "in this section , we shall investigate the local properties of the cmb field , especially the wmap cold spot , by using the local statistics : mean temperature , variance , skewness and kurtosis .",
    "the statistics of local skewness and kurtosis were firstly introduced in @xcite . for a given cmb map with @xmath22 ( vw7 , ilc7 or nilc5 ) , we degrade it to the lower resolution @xmath23 to reduce the effect of the noises . and",
    "then , for this degraded map , the constructive process can be formalized as follows : let @xmath24 be a spherical cap with an aperture of @xmath25 degree , centered at @xmath26 .",
    "we can define the functions @xmath27 ( mean temperature ) , @xmath28 ( standard deviation ) , @xmath29 ( skewness ) and @xmath30 ( kurtosis ) that assign to the @xmath31 cap , centered at @xmath26 by the following way : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of pixels in the @xmath31 cap , @xmath34 is the temperature at @xmath35 pixel .",
    "obviously , the values @xmath36 and @xmath37 obtained in this way for each cap can be viewed as the measures of non - gaussianity in the direction of the center of the cap @xmath26 . for a given aperture @xmath25 ,",
    "we scan the celestial sphere with evenly distributed spherical caps , and build the @xmath38- , @xmath39- , @xmath40- , @xmath41-maps . in our analyses",
    ", we have chosen the locations of centroids of spots to be the pixels in @xmath42 resolution . by choosing different @xmath25 values",
    ", one can study the local properties of the cmb field at different scales . in @xcite",
    ", the statistics @xmath43 and @xmath44 with large @xmath25 values have been applied to study the large - scale global non - gaussianity in the cmb field . however , in this paper we shall apply them to study the cmb local properties .",

    "we have adopted @xmath46.,title=\"fig:\",width=151 ]    it is important to mention that these definitions can not well localize the non - gaussian sources .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the kurtosis map @xmath41 ( left panel ) , we find the clear circular morphology around the point sources .",
    "this means that the values of @xmath37 always maximize / minimize at the edge of the circles , rather than the center of the circles . to overcome it and localize the non - gaussian sources , it is better to define the following average quantities , @xmath47 where @xmath48 for mean temperature , standard deviation , skewness and kurtosis .",
    "@xmath49 is the corresponding local quantities defined above , and @xmath33 is again the number of pixels in the @xmath31 cap . for the comparison , we plot the corresponding @xmath45 in the right panel of fig .",

    "now , let us apply the method to the cmb maps .",
    "firstly , we consider the vw7 map . by choosing @xmath46",

    "the figures clearly show that these local statistics are sensitive to the foreground residuals and various point sources . from @xmath51-map ,",
    "one finds that most non - gaussianities come from the galactic plane around @xmath52 .",
    "however , from @xmath53- , @xmath54- and @xmath55-maps , various extra point sources far from the galactic plane are clearly presented .",
    "these contaminations can be well excluded by the kq75y7 mask @xcite , which is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] . in this figure ,",
    "we plot the same figures as those in fig .",

    "we find that these ilc maps are much cleaner than vw7 map in all the four @xmath51- , @xmath53- , @xmath54- , @xmath55-maps .",
    "even so , from the @xmath53- , @xmath54- , @xmath55-maps , we also find some non - gaussian sources in the galactic plane .",
    "in addition , two significant sources at ( @xmath56 ) and ( @xmath57 ) are clearly presented in ilc7 maps , which have been identified as the known point sources , and excluded by the kq75y7 mask .",
