    "recent observations of the cores of galaxy clusters have undermined the long standing `` cooling flow '' paradigm .",
    "these observations do not detect the expected telltale signs of cooling , and thus point to some , still moot , mechanism that heats the core gas and keeps it at an elevated temperature despite its short cooling time ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , bauer et al . 2005 ; peterson and fabian 2006 ; sanderson et al .",
    "several heating mechanism have been proposed .",
    "the most popular , at present , seems to be heating by central agn activity ( see , e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "2003 , omma et al .",
    "2004 , and nipoti and binney 2005 for a discussion of its pros and cons ) .",
    "dark matter ( dm ) , in its presently favored variety of weakly interacting particles , is not deemed a factor in these considerations , as it does not affect the gasdynamics in the core ( but see , e.g. , chuzhoy and nusser 2006 for possible effects of more strongly interacting dm ) .",
    "mond was introduced as an alternative to newtonian dynamics that seeks to explain the dynamics in galactic systems without dm .",
    "it , arguably , works very well for galaxies , galaxy groups , and super clusters , and has made considerable theoretical headway ( for reviews see , e.g. , sanders and mcgaugh 2002 , scarpa 2006 , bekenstein 2006 , milgrom 2008 ) .",
    "but in galaxy clusters mond does not completely explain away the mass discrepancy .",
    "this is particularly so in the very cores of clusters where a large remaining discrepancy is found .",
    "so even with mond one has to invoke yet undetected matter peculiar to clusters : presumably in some baryonic form , hereafter cbdm .",
    "massive neutrinos with mass near the present experimental upper limit of 2 ev were also proposed ( sanders 2003 , 2007 ) .",
    "mond determines the overall potential field in the cluster , but does not directly affect the microphysics of the cooling flow and core gas .",
    "it does , however , shed new light on the possible role of dm in cluster gasdynamics : ( i ) unlike the standard view according to which the dm constituents are weakly interacting particles , in the context of mond the cluster dm is likely to be baryonic ; so , it can possibly interact with the gas in ways relevant to the cooling puzzle .",
    "( ii ) according to mond , this cbdm is peculiar to clusters ; so , it is not subject to the stringent constraints we have on ubiquitous baryonic dm candidates in galaxies ( e.g. , carr and sakellariadou 1999 , carr 2000 , kamaya and silk 2002 ) .",
    "( iii ) although in the inner parts of clusters , the required amount of cbdm is large compared with that observed in stars and gas , the total amount required for the cluster at large is comparable to the mass of the hot gas .",
    "this renders the baryonic option more palatable .",
    "it also greatly relaxes constraints on baryonic dm in clusters based on standard dynamics , which requires 5 - 10 times more dm .",
    "such small quantities of a new baryonic component easily satisfy nucleosynthesis constraints .",
    "i discuss the possibility that such a baryon component could keep the core gas from cooling precipitously , thus helping alleviate the `` cooling flow '' puzzle .",
    "the total kinetic energy budget of the cbdm is known , and is sufficient to supply heating for many hubble times .",
    "the idea of heating the cluster gas with baryonic dm is not new ( e.g. walker 1999 ) , but as explained above , it takes quite a different shape in the context of mond .",
    "i start by reviewing in section 2 the basic phenomenology of mond , and its possible origin in cosmology ; its significance and implications for the dm paradigm are discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "i summarize what mond tells us about dm in clusters . in section 5",
    "i list candidates for the cbdm and discuss heating mechanisms .",
    "mond can be described as a modification of dynamics at low accelerations ( milgrom 1983a ) .",
    "more precisely , the mond paradigm rests on the following premises : ( i ) there appears a new constant in dynamics , @xmath0 , with the dimensions of acceleration .",
    "( ii ) in the formal limit @xmath1 classical ( pre - mond ) dynamics is restored .",
    "( iii ) for purely gravitational systems , in the deep - mond limit , @xmath2 , the limiting equations can be brought to a form in which the constants @xmath0 and @xmath3 , and all masses in the problem , @xmath4 , appear only as @xmath5 ( milgrom 2005 ) .",
    "this is a fiat that guarantees the required mond phenomenology in purely gravitational systems .",
    "these requirements can be incorporated in various mond theories .",
    "for example , in the nonrelativistic regime one can modify the poisson equation for the gravitational field ( bekenstein and milgrom 1984 ) , or one can modify the kinetic action of particles leading to modified inertia ( milgrom 1994a ) .",
    "it follows from the basic assumptions that any mond theory must be nonlinear even in the nonrelativistic regime ( see e.g. , milgrom 2008 for details ) . from the above mond tenets ( and the assumption that @xmath0 is the only new dimensioned constant ) also follow some important scaling laws ( under which @xmath6 is invariant ) for the deep mond limit of purely gravitational systems in any mond theory ( see milgrom 2008 for more details ) : the theory is invariant under scaling of the radii @xmath7 , and times @xmath8 ( masses are unscaled ) .",
    "( this is part of the conformal invariance , in space alone , of the deep mond limit in a particular formulation of mond ",
    "milgrom 1997 ) .    as a consequences of this scaling invariance",
    "we deduce that if @xmath9 is a trajectory of a body in a configuration of masses @xmath4 at positions @xmath10 , then @xmath11 is a trajectory for the configuration where @xmath4 are at @xmath12 , and the velocities on that trajectory are @xmath13 . there is another scaling property : if we scale all the masses , all trajectory paths remain the same but the body traverses them with all velocities scaling as @xmath14 .",
    "ultimately , one would like to incorporate these principles in a relativistic extension of general relativity .",
    "the state of the art of this effort is the teves theory and its derivatives ( bekenstein 2004 , and bruneton and esposito - farese 2007 ) .",
    "i shall not discuss theories here ; for a recent review see bekenstein ( 2006 ) .",
    "the theories proposed so far involve a free function that essentially interpolates between the above two limits .",
    "schematically , @xmath0 plays a similar role to @xmath15 in relativity , or to @xmath16 in quantum theory . on one hand",
    ", they all mark the boundaries between the classical and the modified regimes ; so formally pushing these boundaries to the appropriate limits ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or @xmath1 ) one restores the corresponding classical theory . on the other hand",
    ", these constants also feature prominently in the physics of the modified regime and appear in various phenomenological relations .",
    "examples of such relations for @xmath16 are : the black body spectrum , the photoelectric effect , the hydrogen atomic spectrum , the quantum hall effect , etc .. for @xmath15 we could mention the ( relativistic ) doppler effect , the mass - velocity relation , the life - time - velocity relation , and the radius of a black hole . these relations , in themselves , are independent in the sense that they do not follow from each other and are made related only through the underlying theory . the mond paradigm similarly predicts a number of laws relating to galactic motions , some of which are qualitative , but many of which are quantitative and involve @xmath0 ; they may be likened to kepler s laws of planetary motions .",
    "more details of these predictions and how they follow in mond can be found in milgrom ( 2008 ) . here is a partial list of such laws .    *",
    "the rotation curves for an isolated mass is asymptotically flat : @xmath19 ( milgrom 1983b ) .",
    "this follows for all mond theories from the above mentioned scaling of length and time . *",
    "the mass - velocity relation ( aka the baryonic tf relation ) between the total mass of a body and its @xmath20 : @xmath21 ( milgrom 1983b , see analysis in mcgaugh 2005a , and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] here ) .",
    "this also follows in all mond theories from the above mentioned scaling of orbital velocities with mass in the deep mond limit .",
    "+ [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     one may wonder why this cbdm appears in clusters but not in spiral galaxies .",
    "the unswer may lie in the fact that the two types of objects differ greatly in appearance , baryonic content , and probably in their formation process .",
    "most of the observed mass in clusters is in the form of hot , x - ray emitting gas , with only a small fraction in stars , while in spirals the situation is the opposite .",
    "because the required total amount of cbdm is comparable with that of the hot gas , it is conceivable that in clusters a fraction of the baryons have somehow gone into forming the cbdm , while this has not happened in spirals .",
    "if this is connected with the appearance of much of the baryonic content as hot gas , it may also be important for elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups enshrouded in hot gas .",
    "like cdm and neutrinos , some forms of cbdm are inherently ineffective in heating the gas",
    ". this would be the case , e.g. , for brown dwarfs , planetary size objects , or too compact , cool gas clouds .",
    "on the other hand , black holes of different masses could accrete and radiate , or if they are massive enough they could lose kinetic energy to the gas by dynamical friction .",
    "cbdm in the form of cool dense gas clouds could convert their kinetic energy to thermal energy of the hot gas if they are large and massive enough to collide at a sufficient rate ( e.g. , walker 1999 ) .",
    "i shall concentrate on the cbdm kinetic energy as the source of heat : if the objects making up the cbdm move with the cluster virial speed , which is a reasonable assumption considering their distribution , the reservoir of their kinetic energy in the core alone is tens of times larger than the thermal energy of the gas there .",
    "if the cbdm bodies have more radial orbits the core can tap even a larger reservoir .",
    "such a heating source is smoothly distributed in space and rather steady with time . the volume density of the heating rate scales like the product of two densities ( cbdm - cbdm for cloud - cloud collisions , cbdm - gas for dynamical friction ) so there is a chance that the balance of the cooling rate will extend over a range of radii . all these are considered to be expedient for solving the puzzle ( see e.g. peterson et al .",
    "also , the resulting steady state temperature of the cooling gas has to be a fraction of the virial temperature and no overheating can occur .",
    "i now discuss briefly one possible mechanism with the cbdm in the form of cool dense gas clouds .",
    "cold , dense gas clouds as dm have been discussed by pfenniger et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , walker and wardle ( 1998 ) , and in many succeeding papers by them and others ( see , e.g. , kamaya and silk 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "notably , walker ( 1999 ) discussed collisions between such clouds as a dominant source of the x - ray emission from galaxy clusters .",
    "walker , however , assumed that these clouds constitute the ubiquitous dm , and also that they are responsible for the so called extreme scattering events in the galaxy .",
    "this determines the cloud parameters ( mass and radius ) quite stringently .",
    "as explained in the introduction , we are here totally free from such constraints , and can reconsider the process in a new light .",
    "ablation of the clouds by the hot gas is also at work , and contributes to the heating .",
    "the rate of heating by ablation , or collisions , is proportional to the mass flux a cloud sees in his rest frame .",
    "since the mass flux in cbdm is rather larger than that in hot gas in the cluster core ( by the ratio of their densities ) , one would estimate the relative contribution of ablation to be small .",
    "however , it can be made important if the cross section of the clouds to ablation is larger than that for collisions ; e.g. , if clouds have an extended magnetic field of such strength that it can drag the gas but hardly affect the more compact clouds that fly by . in",
    "what follows i ll consider only collisions .    the processes occurring today regarding the cloud - gas system can not really be understood in disjunction from the full system history . because , typically , the total cbdm mass is comparable with that in hot gas it is possible that , in fact , much of the presently observed hot gas originated in cold clouds that collided and converted their kinetic energy to heat ( as proposed by walker 1999 ) .",
    "the evolution of the cloud population is thus also an important aspect .",
    "the life time of a cloud against destruction by collisions depends on its size and its location , as well as on properties of the cloud population .",
    "so , the mass and size distribution of the clouds should be a function of location , with much mixing on the cluster crossing time scale .",
    "there is also redistribution of heat and gas on hydrodynamical time scale , with clouds from large radii ( perhaps even from the very outskirts of the cluster ) replenishing those at smaller radii where destruction is more effective .    to get a rough idea of the properties of the clouds that are today most efficient in heating , i assume that at present all clouds are identical in size and mass , and require that the rate of kinetic energy transfer due to cloud collisions balances cooling locally .",
    "i also assume that most of the energy released goes into heat , as opposed to being radiated away ( see below ) .",
    "we can write the ratio of the heating rate , @xmath22 , to the cooling rate , @xmath23 in a uniform spherical volume , representing the cluster core , of radius @xmath24 as :    @xmath25 ( t_dm / t_gas-1 ) ( _ cool/_cross)(_dm/_cl ) , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the total mass and kinetic temperature of the cbdm in the core volume , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 are those of the gas ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the cooling time and the crossing time ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the 1-d velocity ) , @xmath34 is the mean surface density of the core cbdm , @xmath35 is that of a single cloud ( @xmath36 being its mass , and @xmath37 its radius ) . the coefficient @xmath38 is a geometrical factor taking into account a gaussian velocity distribution of the clouds , angle of impact , and impact parameter distribution . using results from walker ( 1999 ) i find @xmath39 .",
    "we have direct knowledge of all the quantities appearing on the right hand side , except for @xmath40 , which can thus be constrained by the requirement for heating to balance cooling at present . substituting typical values for cooling cluster cores : @xmath41 ; @xmath42 and @xmath43    ",
    "_ cl~10 ^ 4_dm~10 ^ 3m_dm,13r^-2_2 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the mass and size of the clouds separately .",
    "these may depend on how the clouds formed , which of them have already disappear , what supports them , etc ..    the first rough equality in eq.([ii ] ) tells us that the total sky cover factor of the clouds in the core is @xmath44 , which means that the cloud - cloud - collision life time of a single cloud is @xmath45 crossing times .",
    "this turns out to be of the order of the hubble time , which may not be a mere coincidence , but a result of cloud evolution that culls out clouds with shorter life times .",
    "the small cloud sky cover factor is also in line with the observations of the bullet cluster as it means that the cbdm masses of two colliding clusters would go through each other practically intact .    the second rough equality in eq.([ii ] )",
    "tells us that the cloud s optical depth is very large . in a collision ,",
    "much of the kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy .",
    "part of this is converted back into hydrodynamic energy of the gas debris expanding from the collision region ; another part escapes as radiation .",
    "the photon escape time is typically @xmath46 , and is at least a few times longer in our case than the expansion time @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the post - collision expansion seed , which is of the order of the cluster virial speed .",
    "this means that only a fraction of the collision energy goes into radiation so the energy transfer to gas heating is efficient ( it also means that the radiation comes out at lower frequencies ) .",
    "the collision debris carrying much of the kinetic energy of the colliding clouds will be much more diffused , and will readily deposit their energy in the gas .",
    "calculations are needed to pinpoint the exact details of the collision to see if indeed all this can be made to work as required .",
    "there are , in principle , at least two ways in which the effects of such cbdm clouds can be observed directly , and which have to be studied in more detail .",
    "the first is the direct observation of radiation flashes coming out of individual cloud collisions .",
    "the characteristics of the flash : its total energy , duration , typical photon energy , and frequency of occurrence depend strongly on the mass of individual clouds and on the details of the collision ( which , as we saw , involves a very optically thick system ) .",
    "the other means of direct detection is via microlensing of quasar images behind a cluster . since the cloud surface density has to be much larger than @xmath49 , they are well within their einstein radius for lensing at cosmological distances , and should be effective microlenses .",
    "the sky cover factor of einstein discs of the clouds , which is the probability for appreciable microlensing amplification is , of course , similar to the strong lensing probability by the cluster core , which is typically not much less then unity .",
    "microlensing of quasar images have been identified ( fohlmeister 2006a , b ) .",
    "the expected microlensing duration by clouds depends on the masses of individual clouds .",
    "some microlensing constraints on cbdm masses are mentioned by carr ( 2000 ) , but , as explained above should be relaxed for the cbdm quantities implied by mond .",

    "<S> i then concentrate on galaxy clusters in light of mond , which still requires some yet undetected cluster dark matter , presumably in some baryonic form ( cbdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this cbdm might contribute to the heating of the x - ray emitting gas and thus alleviate the cooling - flow puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> mond , qua theory of dynamics , does not directly enter the microphysics of the gas ; however , it does force a new outlook on the role of dm in shaping the cluster gasdynamics : mond tells us that the cluster dm is not cold dark matter , is not so abundant , and is not expected in galaxies ; it is thus not subject to constraints on baryonic dm in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the mass in cbdm required in a whole cluster is , typically , similar to that in hot gas , but is rather more centrally concentrated , totally dominating the core . </S>",
    "<S> the cbdm contribution to the baryon budget in the universe is thus small . </S>",
    "<S> its properties , deduced for isolated clusters , are consistent with the observations of the `` bullet cluster '' . </S>",
    "<S> its kinetic - energy reservoir is much larger than that of the hot gas in the core , and would suffice to keep the gas hot for many cooling times . </S>",
    "<S> heating can be effected in various ways depending on the exact nature of the cbdm , from very massive black holes to cool , compact gas clouds .    </S>",
