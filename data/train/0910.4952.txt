    "a standard coin flipping is a game in which 2 parties , alice and bob , wish to flip a coin from a distance .",
    "the two parties do not trust each other , and would each like to win with probability of at least @xmath4 .",
    "a natural problem is to find good protocols - a protocol in which a player could not cheat and force the outcome of the game to his benefit .",
    "there are two types of coin flipping - strong and weak . in strong coin flipping",
    ", each party might want to bias the outcome to any result . in weak coin flipping each party has a favorite outcome .",
    "we denote the winning probability of an honest alice in @xmath5 , and similarly @xmath6 for bob .",
    "the maximum winning probability of a cheating alice ( i.e. when she acts according to her optimal strategy , and when bob is honest ) is denoted by @xmath7 , and similarly @xmath8 for bob .",
    "+ let @xmath9 be the _ bias _ of the protocol .",
    "the bias actually tells us how good the protocol is .",
    "the smaller the bias is , the better the protocol is , because the cheating options decrease .",
    "it is well known that without computational assumptions , coin flipping ( whether weak or strong ) is impossible to achieve in the classical world .",
    "that is , one of the players can always win with probability @xmath10 . in the quantum setting ,",
    "the problem is far more interesting .",
    "quantum strong coin flipping protocols with large but still non - trivial biases were first discovered .",
    "kitaev then proved ( see for example in @xcite ) that in strong coin flipping , every protocol must satisfy @xmath11 , hence @xmath12 .",
    "this result raised the question of whether weak coin flipping with arbitrarily small bias is possible .",
    "protocols were found with smaller and smaller biases , until mochon showed in his paper @xcite that there are families of weak coin flipping protocols whose bias converges to zero .",
    "it is also known that even in the quantum world , a perfect protocol ( i.e. @xmath13 ) is not possible .",
    "if we try to expand the problem of weak coin flipping to more than @xmath14 parties - namely @xmath15 parties with @xmath0 possible outcomes , where each party @xmath16 wins if the outcome is @xmath17 , we get the leader election problem .",
    "as mentioned before , it is classically impossible to do a weak coin flipping with a bias @xmath18 without assumptions about the computation power . hence , it is also impossible to solve the leader election problem in the classical setting .",
    "@xcite presents a classical leader election protocol ( given that a player can flip a coin by herself ) that given @xmath19 honest players , an honest player is chosen with probability @xmath20 in addition there is a proof that every classical protocol has a success probability of @xmath21 , for every @xmath22 .",
    "note that there are limitation on the number of cheaters .",
    "there are many types of leader elections .",
    "the most natural type seems to be the one we have just defined , which is @xmath0 parties wanting to select one of them as a leader .",
    "we will refer to this type as the _ leader election problem_. + another possibility is a protocol that chooses a processor randomly among @xmath0 possibilities ( there are no cheaters , and we want a protocol that uses minimal complexity , or one that works without knowing the number of processors .",
    "see @xcite ) .",
    "this type sometimes called _ fair leader election problem_. + until recently there was no quantum result regarding the leader election problem as it was defined here .",
    "however there were some results on other types , such as @xcite which allow penalty for cheaters that got caught ( which is obviously a weaker version of the problem ) .",
    "in @xcite mochon showed the existence of a weak coin flipping protocol with an arbitrarily small bias of at most @xmath23 .",
    "let us denote this protocol in @xmath24 throughout this paper .",
    "this protocol assumes that an honest player has @xmath25 chance of winning .",
    "it is also possible to build an unbalanced weak coin flipping with an arbitrarily small bias @xmath23 , in which one honest player will have @xmath26 winning probability , and the other player will have @xmath27 winning probability .",
    "we will denote this protocol as @xmath28 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this is possible using repetition of @xmath24 .",
    "it is very likely that this can also be achieved by finding an appropriate families of time independent point games ( see @xcite ) , but this will not be done in this paper .",
    "we will present a leader election protocol with @xmath0 parties ( based on mochon s result ) in which the probability of an honest player to win converges to @xmath29 .",
    "our protocol is fairly simple and uses @xmath30 rounds of unbalanced weak protocols @xmath31 as will be defined later .",
    "the protocol uses at most @xmath30 unbalanced weak coin flip protocols .",
    "this limitation is important , because at the moment we only know how to implement an unbalanced flip using a repetition of balanced coin flip , which influences our running time complexity .",
    "if @xmath0 is a power of @xmath14 , then the quantum solution is easy ( given a good weak coin flip protocol ) - we can do a tournament ( the looser quits ) with @xmath32 weak coin flip rounds , and the winner of the tournament will be elected as the leader . a problem arise when @xmath0 is not a power of @xmath14 , then this is not possible , and putting in a dummy involves some difficulties . if the cheaters could control the dummy , they would increase their winning probability .",
    "our first solution ( which was also discovered in @xcite , independently ) is to let @xmath33 play @xmath34 and then the winner of that will play @xmath35 and so on , as in a tournament , except we use unbalanced weak coin flips .",
    "these are also known to be possible using the weak coin flipping protocol ( see in @xcite ) but are more expensive in terms of time .",
    "+ the leader will be the winner of the final ( @xmath36 ) step .",
    "this works , however it uses many ( @xmath36 ) rounds , and thus we later combine the two ideas in order to reduce the number of rounds .",
    "we start by some standard definitions .      by a _ weak coin flipping protocol _",
    "we mean that alice wins if the outcome is @xmath37 , and bob wins if it is @xmath10 .",
    "a protocol with @xmath38 , bias @xmath23 will be denoted by @xmath28 .    a _ leader election protocol _ with @xmath0 parties @xmath15 has an outcome @xmath39 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath40 the probability that the outcome is @xmath41 .",
    "we assume that each player has its own private space , untouchable by other players , a message space @xmath42 which is common to all ( @xmath42 can include a space for the idification of the sender and receiver ) .",
    "we use the existence of a weak coin flipping protocol with bias at most @xmath23 for every @xmath22 .",
    "this fact was proved in @xcite for @xmath43 and we will denote it as @xmath24 and by @xmath44 the number of its rounds .",
    "it seems possible to generalize it to any @xmath45 , but that was not proved yet .",
    "there is a proof that there is such a protocol for every @xmath45 in @xcite by repetitions of @xmath24 , with @xmath46 rounds .",

    "[ p_q , e]for @xmath56 the protocol @xmath28 will use no more than @xmath57 rounds .",
    "there is one delicate point , that the cheaters can not increase their winning probability in a specific protocol , by loosing previous protocols ( say by creating entanglements ) .",
    "this will be discussed in the end .",
    "we will first present the simpler case of 3 parties , to show the basic idea .",
    "the general case is a natural generalization of this , and we will analyze it in details .",
    "nevertheless this case captures the basic idea of the problem and solution .",
