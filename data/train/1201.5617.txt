    "the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) is the collective radiation emitted throughout cosmic history , including from sources inaccessible to current telescopic studies ( see review by kashlinsky , 2005 ) .",
    "the latter category includes the very first luminous objects , currently a subject of intense investigations and great importance for astronomy and cosmology .",
    "cib fluctuations can be more readily discerned than the actual mean level of the background allowing to overcome the significant galactic and solar system foregrounds at these wavelengths ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "1996a , b , kashlinsky & odenwald 2000 ) .",
    "it is generally believed now as a result of detailed numerical simulations of the formation of first structures in the standard cosmological model that the first objects to form in the universe , the so - called population iii stars , were very massive stars that occupied a brief era at epochs inaccessible to direct telescopic observations ( see review by bromm & et al .",
    "because distant galaxies and pre - galactic structures are clustered , the cib has angular fluctuations with a distinct spectral and spatial signal including a possibly measurable contribution from the first stars era ( bond et al .",
    "1986 , kashlinsky et al .",
    "2004 , cooray et al .",
    "the distribution on the sky of the luminous objects to form at early times should be considerably different from the cosmic pattern seen today , with the differences diverging toward large angular scales and being particularly prominent between 5@xmath5 to 1@xmath6 .",
    "although the individual sources at very high @xmath7 are too faint to observe on their own , fluctuations in the intensity of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) will reflect the distribution of those early objects after foreground sources are removed to sufficiently faint levels . in the course of the prior work we discovered significant source - subtracted cib fluctuations on scales as large as @xmath8 in deep _ spitzer _",
    "irac ( 3.68 @xmath9 m ) data ( kashlinsky et al . 2005 , 2007a , b , c - hereafter kamm1,2,3,4 ) .",
    "extensive details of our analysis and a multitude of tests it was subjected to along with a summary of requirements any reliable cib data analysis should meet in the presence of significant foreground and instrumental effects is given in arendt et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter - akmm ) .",
    "as thoroughly documented in akmm , we have been very careful with the processing of the individual irac exposures into complete deep mosaicked images .",
    "akmm include details with the numerous thorough checks to confirm that we are not being misled by instrumental artifacts or variations of the zodiacal light .",
    "we test that we see similar background fluctuations in various fields located at different ecliptic and galactic latitudes . while all our background fluctuation measurements have been derived from irac data , the recent results of matsumoto et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find similar background fluctuations using completely independent data from the _ akari _ satellite , and with performing an independent analysis .",
    "this is the further confirmation that the fluctuations are not caused by any hidden error in the irac data or our analysis .",
    "the residual cib fluctuations remain after removing galaxies down to very faint levels and must arise from populations with a significant clustering component , but only low levels of the shot noise .",
    "as suggested by kamm1 these cib fluctuations may originate in early populations .",
    "further , it was demonstrated by kamm4 that there are no correlations between the source - subtracted irac maps and the faintest resolved sources observed with the _ hst _ acs at optical wavelengths , which likely points to the high-@xmath7 origin of the fluctuations , or at least to a very faint population not yet observed by other means .",
    "the high-@xmath7 interpretation of the detected cib anisotropies has received strong further confirmation in the recent _ akari _ data analysis which , in addition , measured source - subtracted cib fluctuations at 2.4  and pointed out that the colors of the fluctuations require them being produced by highly redshifted very luminous sources ( matsumoto et al .",
    "it is inherently important to advance the understanding of the nature and the epochs of the populations producing these cib fluctuations with new studies which can be obtained measuring the spatial distribution of the fluctuations at much larger angular scales .",
    "this was one of the motivations of the seds program ( fazio et al .",
    "2008 ) and the first results from it are presented below .",

    "[ sec : foregrounds ] presents comprehensive tests done to isolate the various non - cosmological contributions to the results and both low- and high-@xmath7 contributors are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] , where it is shown that the signal can not be accounted for by the observed populations of known galaxies and requires either unknown new populations at low-@xmath7 made of low - luminosity systems and distributed very differently from the rest of the present day galaxies , or is dominated by the high-@xmath7 populations at epochs associated with  first stars \" and clustered according to the established concordance @xmath4cdm model .",
    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ is a 0.85 m diameter telescope launched into an earth - trailing solar orbit in 2003 ( werner et al .",
    "2004 , gehrz et al .",
    "2007 ) . for nearly 6 years ,",
    "as it was cooled by liquid he , its three scientific instruments provided imaging and spectroscopy at wavelengths from 3.6 to 160 @xmath9 m . in the time since the he supply was exhausted , _ spitzer _ has continued to provide 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath9 m imaging with its infrared array camera ( irac ) .",
    "the irac camera has a @xmath10 field of view , and a pixel scale of @xmath11 , which slightly undersampled the instrument beam size of @xmath12 ( fwhm ) ( fazio et al .",
    "2004a ) .",
    "the seds program is designed to provide deep imaging at 3.6 and 4.5  over a total area of about 1 square degree , distributed over 5 well - studied regions ( fazio et al .",
    "the area covered is about ten times greater than previous _",
    "coverage at comparable depth .",
    "while the main use of the seds data sets will be the investigation of the individually detectable and countable galaxies , the remaining backgrounds in these data are well - suited for cib studies , by virtue of their angular scale , sensitivity and observing strategies .",
    "the first 2 of the seds fields to be completed have been used in this study : the ultradeep survey field ( uds ; program i d = 61041 ) and the extended groth strip ( egs ; program i d = 61042 ) .",
    "the locations , sizes , and depths of these fields are listed in table 1 .",
    "the fields are located at moderate to high galactic latitudes to minimize the number of foreground stars and the brightness of the emission from interstellar medium ( cirrus ) .",
    "these fields also lie at relatively high ecliptic latitudes , which helps minimize the brightness and temporal change in the zodiacal light from interplanetary dust .",
    "the observations of each field are carried out at three different epochs , spaced 6 months apart .    for cib fluctuations analysis in the assembled maps",
    "we have selected regions of approximately uniform exposure in _ both _ channel 1 and 2 .",
    "these covered a square region of approximately 21@xmath5 on the side in the uds field and a rectangular region of @xmath13 in the egs field .",
    "the procedure for map assembly is described in our previous papers ( kamm1 - 4 ) with an extensive summary including all the tests given in ( akmm ) .",
    "below we briefly revisit the adopted formalism and its advantages over the standard methods when it comes to removing instrumental artifacts without introducing spurious correlations .",
    "this is critically important if one were to robustly measure fluctuations signals as faint as that expected from first stars era , @xmath14 nw / m@xmath15/sr at arcminute scales .",
    "the individual 100 sec frame time exposures are processed by the standard irc calibration pipeline , and then additionally corrected for the `` column - pulldown effect '' which affects the detector output in columns that contain very bright stars .",
    "the individual frames are then further processed and combined into mosaicked images ( with a @xmath11 pixel scale ) using the self - calibration procedure that we have previously employed for this work .",
    "the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath9 m images are processed independently . at each wavelength , the frames are also processed in several different groups to provide multiple images that can be used to assess random and systematic errors .",
    "one set of three groups is obtained by separating the data by each of the three epochs .",
    "comparison of results between these three sets can provide indications of systematic errors induced by variations in the zodiacal light over 6 month intervals .",
    "the other set of two groups is obtained by separating the full sequence of frames into the alternating even and odd frame numbers .",
    "comparison of results from these `` a '' and `` b '' subsets provides a good diagnostic of the random instrument noise , because the a and b subsets only differ by a mean interval of @xmath16s .",
    "we applied the least - squares self - calibration procedure described by ( fixsen et al .",
    "the approach formalizes the calibration procedure by describing the data with parameters that include both the detector characteristics and the true sky intensity .",
    "the derivation of these parameters via a least - squares algorithm yields an optimal solution for the calibration and the sky intensity . in this case",
    "our chosen model is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the raw data from a single pixel of a single frame , @xmath19 is the sky intensity at location @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the offset for detector pixel @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is a variable offset for each of the 4 readouts ( alternate vertical columns of the detector ) and each frame .",
    "this assumes that the sky intensity ( @xmath19 ) and the detector offsets ( @xmath21 ) are invariant during the course of the observations . for a data set with fixed frame times ( as our irac data ) , the detector dark current",
    "is included in the @xmath21 term as it is indistinguishable from an offset . for data sets with multiple frame times ,",
    "a relatively simple extension of this data model could be applied .",
    "the variable offset @xmath23 can absorb time ",
    "dependent behavior of the detector , but only to the extent that it can be characterized with a single value per frame , or in some cases , a single value per readout per frame .",
    "while technically the cib is the sum of all extragalactic emission , here we wish to exclude individually detectable objects and analyze the remaining cib which is produced by fainter sources .",
    "the mosaicked images were cleaned of resolved sources in two stages . in the first stage ,",
    "we construct and subtract an iterative `` model '' of all the sources in the image .",
    "this is done using a variant of the clean algorithm , in which our iterative loop consists of ( a ) identifying the brightest pixel in the image , and ( b ) subtracting a scaled version of the instrument psf ( including the broad low - level wings ) to reduce this intensity by a set fraction ( chosen as 50% ) . subtracting only a fraction of a source at each iteration",
    "allows the model to compensate for sources that are intrinsically extended in size , and for inaccuracies in the psf .",
    "various criteria for selecting the final iteration are given in akmm ; all lead to very similar results . in order to compare the signal from different sky locations ,",
    "the final iteration can be chosen to correspond to a given shot - noise level .",
    "the second stage involves the construction of masks which are used to set areas at the locations of bright sources to zero .",
    "if the model worked perfectly , this would not be necessary . however , small differences between the model s ideal psf and the effective psf of the mosaicked images lead to relatively large amplitude residuals at the locations of bright stars .",
    "therefore we construct a mask which is used to zero all pixels above an effective @xmath24 surface brightness .",
    "all 8 neighbors of any such pixel are also set to zero .",
    "this clipping is done independently of the model - subtraction and the procedure is iterated until no new pixels above the fixed threshold remain .",
    "the fraction of unmasked pixels is @xmath25 which enables robust fft analysis .",

    "they are to a good accuracy gaussian with very small residual skewness , @xmath26 , parameters ( @xmath27 ) .    in order to evaluate the random noise level of the maps ,",
    "alternate calibrated frames for each dataset were mapped into separate `` a '' and `` b '' mosaics .",
    "the difference of the a and b mosaics should eliminate true celestial sources and stable instrumental effects and reflect only the random noise of the observations .",
    "the power spectrum of the instrument noise is then subtracted from the power spectrum of the assembled maps to give the measured signal of the remaining source - subtracted cib fluctuations in the maps .",
    "the maps under study are clipped and masked of the resolved sources , yielding the fluctuation field , @xmath28 .",
    "its fourier transform , @xmath29 is calculated using the fft .",

    "a typical rms flux fluctuation is @xmath32 on the angular scale of wavelength @xmath33 .",
    "the correlation function , @xmath34 , is uniquely related to @xmath35 via fourier transformation .",
    "if the fraction of masked pixels in the maps is too high ( e.g. @xmath36 for irac maps as detailed in kamm1 - 4/akmm ) , the large - scale map properties can not be computed using the fourier transform and instead the maps must be analyzed by direct calculation of @xmath37 , which is immune to mask effects ( kashlinsky 2007 ) .",
    "several quantities are used in computations below .",
    "the power spectrum in a single band @xmath38 is defined as @xmath39 .",
    "it is computed after averaging all independent fourier elements which lie inside the radial interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "since the flux is a real quantity , only one half of the fourier plane is independent , so that at each @xmath31 there are @xmath41 independent measurements of @xmath42 out of a full ring with @xmath43 data .",
    "because we will compare two fields of different configurations , the fourier space of each was binned at the same grid of @xmath31 , the mean power was then evaluated and the relative ( poissonian ) errors on that determination were computed as @xmath44 .    after demonstrating that different fields have statistically similar power spectrum ,",
    "the overall power at each @xmath31 was averaged over the different fields with each field weighted by the relative statistical uncertainty defined by its configuration ( see below ) , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "this is equivalent to simply averaging over all @xmath46 available from each field @xmath47 .",
    "we characterize the similarity ( or not ) of the fluctuations measured in different channels , or at different epochs of observations .",
    "a quantity of further interest in this context is the cross - power , which is the fourier transform of the cross - correlation function @xmath48 .",
    "the cross - power spectrum is then given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 standing for the real , imaginary parts .",
    "note the cross - power of a real quantity , such as the flux fluctuation , is always real , but unlike the single ( auto- ) power spectrum the cross - power can be both positive and negative .",

    "instrument artifacts that remain in a fixed geometry with respect to the detector , such as stray light and ghost images , are thus projected on to the field in very different patterns at the different epochs .",
    "the cross - correlations power spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] and demonstrate that the signal comes from the sky rather than the detector .",
    "one of the potential difficulties in measurements of backgrounds and their structure is stray light . stray",
    "light will cause an apparent nonuniform increase in the background across the detector .",
    "the intensity and the pattern of the stray light depends on the distribution of sources _ outside _ of the field of view being observed . in the case of the irac 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath9 m detectors , sources that lie @xmath71 from the top edge of the detector",
    "can scatter light back onto the detector @xcite .",
    "the geometry of the scattering leads to two concentrated regions of stray light in the upper left and right portions of the detector .",
    "uniform diffuse illumination , such as the zodiacal light , leads to a fixed pattern on the detector .",
    "an individual bright source leaves a more concentrated and irregular patch of stray light , but at a location that is well defined given the known source position .",
    "an example of this is shown in the left and center panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : stray ] .",
    "thus individual irac exposures have been masked to exclude regions that are potentially affected by the stray light of stars identified by brightness and color thresholds from the 2mass catalog @xcite .",
    "however , there remains some question of whether or not the stray light from sources at fainter levels might yield some structure in the observed background .",
    "to address this question , we created new versions of the 3.6 @xmath9 m mosaic of the uds field from two subsets for the data .",
    "the first version is made only with data from the upper half of detector , which can be affected by stray light if the data are insufficiently masked .",
    "the second version is made from only from data in the lower half of the detector which is largely unperturbed by stray light .",
    "the difference between these two mosaics would reveal if there were systematic differences between the upper and lower halves of the detector , whether due to stray light or any other instrumental effect .",
    "the difference image reveals no residual stray light near bright stars [ fig .",
    "[ fig : stray ] ( right ) ] and obvious large scale structures [ fig .",
    "[ fig : stray2 ] ] that could arise from the integrated stray light of the many faint sources .",
    "although small scale changes in the instrumental psf between upper and lower halves of the detector are evident at the locations of bright sources .",
    "the power spectrum of the difference image is very similar to the power spectrum of the ( a - b ) image used to assess the instrumental noise ( fig .",
    "[ fig : power ] ) .",
    "therefore we have verified that the observed large - scale fluctuations are not an artifact related to instrumental stray light .",
    "= 1    = 1.0      zodiacal light is the brightest source of foreground emissions at near - ir ( kelsall et al .",
    "1998 ) , but appears to be extremely smooth with relative fluctuations below 0.2% ( abraham et al . 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , pyo et al . (",
    "2012 ) used mid - ir ( 7 - 24 @xmath9 m ) data _ akari _ data to establish upper limits of @xmath72 at the north ecliptic pole .",

    "( 2011 ) for the _ akari_-based results . because the _ spitzer _ orbits with the zodiacal cloud , the zodiacal light intensity and the direction of its gradient will vary with a roughly annual period in each field .",
    "the comparison of power spectra at , and cross - correlation power spectra between , the different epochs also serves as an empirical constraint on the influence of the zodiacal light .",
    "the fields in this study lie at high ecliptic latitude well outside the ecliptic plane where zodi is at its highest . in earlier studies",
    "it was already estimated by us to be much smaller than the detected fluctuations .",
    "the gradient due to zodiacal light would vary as the telescope moves around the sun and hence zodiacal light would contribute different levels at different epochs . then any change in the actual sky brightness or power spectra between three epochs of observations separated by @xmath68 months can be attributed to changes in the zodiacal light .",
    "[ fig : cross ] shows the cross - power spectra between the epochs and the signal in each of the epochs for both fields .",
    "the figure shows that the signal remains the same in each of the epochs and correlates remarkably well between them .",
    "this argues against substantial contribution from either the zodiacal light or detector systematics .    to sum up this part of discussion",
    "we find no significant differences between epochs , demonstrating that zodiacal light is not a significant contributor to the observed spatial fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , the relatively constant intensity of the fluctuations from 3.6 to 4.5 @xmath9 m is at odds with the measured zodiacal light spectrum which rises by a factor of  2.5 from 3.6 to 4.5 @xmath9 m .",
    "[ fig : cross ] shows that the three separate epochs of data produce the same fluctuation signal and they all correlate very well with each other .",
    "this directly confirms that the contribution of the time - varying component to the measured fluctuations at 3.6 and 4.5  is small and zodiacal fluctuations can not account for the measurement .",
    "galactic cirrus is another source of potential confusion in this measurement .",
    "however , its flux levels depend on the line of sight column density of the galactic ism and lead to variations by factor of a few ( @xmath73 ) among all the seven fields probed in our studies ( kamm1 , kamm2 and seds ) . on the other hand , the measured fluctuation signal at 3.6 and 4.5  is the same , within the statistical uncertainties , at all locations .",
    "this by itself argues against a significant contribution of the galactic cirrus emission .",
    "contributions of galactic cirrus to the source - subtracted fluctuations at the near - ir wavelengths have been addressed earlier in our spitzer analysis ( kamm1 - 2 and akmm ) and in the _ akari_-based study ( matsumoto et al .",
    "all of the studies reached the conclusion that galactic cirrus contributes well below the fluctuation levels measured there .",
    "in addition , in the _ akari_-based analysis it was demonstrated that the near - ir source - subtracted maps do not correlate with the same maps observed at 100 , which is the most accurate probe of cirrus emission ( arendt et al .",
    "1998 , schlegel et al . 1998 ) . in order to further verify that the galactic cirrus emission can not contribute appreciably to the signal measured at 3.6 and 4.5  we proceed as outlined in kamm1,2 and akmm with some extra steps .",
    "we measure identical fluctuations in both fields in both irac bands despite the fact that the mean cirrus flux varies by factors of a few from the uds to the egs .",
    "the level of the fluctuations also agrees well with our earlier measurements at five additional locations out to angular scales of @xmath8 ( kamm1,kamm2 ) . as these high latitude deep survey fields",
    "are chosen in part based on having low ism column densities , it is no surprise that we see no direct evidence of cirrus in these fields .",
    "cirrus emission at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath9",
    "m is largely continuum emission from stochastically ( transiently ) heated small dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "an empirical measurement of cirrus emission needs to be made at longer wavelengths , such as 100 @xmath9 m where the emission arises from the bulk of the ism dust ( larger grains at cooler temperatures ) , or at 8 @xmath9 m where the emission is dominated by strong pah emission bands that are closely related to the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath9 m emission .    as in our prior studies , in order to evaluate cirrus contributions we have also examined irac 8  images generated from earlier observing programs carried out while _ spitzer _ was still operating cryogenically .",

    "the 8 @xmath9 m data are somewhat shallower than the seds observations , as the irac 8 @xmath9 m channel was only in operation during earlier cryogenic observations of the egs and uds fields .",
    "the uds field was covered to an average depth of 0.67 hr under spitzer program i d = 40021 , and the egs filed was coved to a mean depth of 1.44 hr under spitzer program i d = 8 .",

    "their amplitudes at large scales are roughly proportional to the mean cirrus intensity predicted ( by extrapolation of 100 @xmath9 m observations ) for these fields .",
    "however , this extrapolation is not precise because of intrinsic variation in the energy spectra of the cirrus .",
    "therefore , these power spectra should be viewed as setting a strict upper limit on the possible cirrus contribution at 8 @xmath9 m .",
    "the 8  fluctuations are also expected to contain contributions from the sources producing the measured signal at 3.6 and 4.5 as well as that from other populations , so assuming that _ all _ of the 8  fluctuations signal is produced by cirrus gives the most conservative assumption about its contribution .",

    "the above discussion strongly suggests that the measured cib fluctuations are produced by sources significantly fainter than the magnitude threshold of our source - removal procedure . in this case , it is likely that the measured shot - noise levels represent an _ upper _ limit on the shot - noise from these sources .",
    "no such faint populations have been observed in the present universe and , in addition , if they exist at low-@xmath7 these very faint cosmological sources would have to cluster very differently from the observed galaxy populations which would likely put them in conflict with the established @xmath4cdm cosmological model .    on the other hand",
    ", such faint populations are expected at high-@xmath7 epochs , but are beyond the sensitivity and/or resolution of current telescopic studies .",
    "these populations would then be clustered according to the standard @xmath4cdm model except their clustering properties would be biased because they form in haloes identified with rare density peaks of the ( overall ) linear density field at these early times ( kashlinsky et al .",

    "while the second assumption is fairly justifiable on the relevant linear scales , the first supposition is likely to be a significant over - simplification and in reality one needs to relate the projected angular power spectrum to the underlying 3-d one via the limber equation after specifying the history and rate of flux production over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "thus within the framework of this  toy \" model , the assumed templates are shown in fig .",

    "this is a consequence of the turn - over scale of the power spectra , which reflects the horizon at the matter - radiation equation in cdm - type models , subtending essentially the same angular scale at @xmath128 .    in detailed comparison of model and data , the effect of the masking on the power spectrum",
    "must be considered .",
    "more specifically , the multiplication of the source subtracted images by a mask ( values of 1 or 0 ) , corresponds to a convolution of the power spectrum by the fourier transform of the mask .",
    "the effect would be redistributing some of the power from spatial scales where it is stronger to those where it is weaker .",
    "this has little impact on a shot noise ( and any other white ) spectrum , but can modify the appearance of a spectrum that rises sharply and has features of interest at large spatial scales . thus the @xmath4cdm - type spectrum is affected more significantly than the spectrum of known galaxies .",
    "this is addressed in detail in appendix b. because the spectrum of the fluctuations is measured from a masked map , the model has to be processed correspondingly .",

    "these sources are individually inaccessible to current telescopic studies and this measurement allows for unique characterization of their properties and spatial distribution . an alternative to this high-@xmath7 interpretation would require the individual sources to be very faint as constrained by the observed shot - noise levels and the absence of correlations with the acs sources ( kamm3 ) , lie at low @xmath7 and have clustering properties significantly different from those of observed galaxy populations .",
    "no such a new population has been observed , or proposed on theoretical grounds , but if true this would represent an important discovery in its own right .",
