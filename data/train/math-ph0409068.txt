    "the identification of fields as operator - valued distributions ( opvd ) is almost as old as quantum field theory ( qft ) itself . to cite only two early basic texts among many just recall bogoliubov - shirkov s @xcite and schweber s @xcite monographs .",
    "bogoliubov and shirkov were original in that their construction of the s - matrix involves test - functions in the range @xmath2 but differrent from zero only in a certain finite space - time region .",
    "the condition of causality applied to the supports of the test functions induces essential relations between the s - matrix amplitudes .",
    "this approach was later pursued and developped by epstein and glaser @xcite leading to a well recognized causal pertubation theory which is `` free of mathematically undefined quantities but hides the multiplicative structure of renormalization '' @xcite .",
    "apparently for most of qft practitioners this was a fatal disease and epstein and glaser s work is scarcely referenced and almost fell into oblivion , save for the important contributions of scharf @xcite .",
    "the situation is different in the world of mathematicians dedicated to the construction of a rigorous and mathematically well defined qft . in this respect",
    "the necessary steps involve the extension of singular distributions to the whole space - time manifold . an often reported conjecture made by a. connes and independently by r. estrada @xcite states that `` hadamard s finite part theory is in principle enough to deal with qft divergences '' .",
    "clearly , for outsiders , the statement called for some clarifications .",
    "they came only recently @xcite .",
    "it appears that a rigorous way to get an extension of a singular distribution is a weighted taylor series surgery , that is to throw away an appropriate jet of the test function at the singularity .",
    "transposed to fourier space the procedure amounts to a substraction method which includes bphz renormalization @xcite as a special case . in minkowskian metric",
    "this is equivalent to the implementation of causality while in the euclidean counterpart it is a symmetry preserving prescription for substractions .",
    "the opvd approach we implemented in the euclidean lcq study of the critical properties of @xmath3-theory @xcite is in the line of epstein and glaser @xcite .",
    "however it has the important additional feature that the paracompactness of the euclidean manifold allows using any partition of unity as @xmath4 test functions with compact support in fourier space .",
    "thereby any uv- divergences in fourier space integrations are properly regulated .",
    "it is our aim here to develop the treatment of fermi - fields as opvd in a gauge field environment , sketched at the lc@xmath5 durham meeting @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be the dirac massive free field , then @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath7 is an opvd which defines a functional @xmath9 with respect to a test function : + @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath9 is an operator - valued functional with the possible interpretation of a more general functional @xmath11 evaluated at + @xmath12 . indeed",
    "the translated functional is a well defined object @xcite such that @xmath13 . due to the properties of @xmath14",
    ", @xmath15 obeys also dirac s equation and is taken as the physical field which is now and most importantly an analytic function of the @xmath16-variable @xcite .",
    "the possible singular behaviour of the original field @xmath7 is now transferred to the class of test functions necessary to define a _ bona - fide _ tempered extension of the original opvd on the whole space - time manifold @xcite . for @xmath0 the fermionic field obeys @xmath17 , and it is clear that the translation in @xmath7 must be done in a way compatible with gauge transformations .",
    "the immediate candidate would be the well known dirac string from @xmath16 to @xmath18 .",
    "but now @xmath19 depends on the path @xmath20 from @xmath16 to @xmath18 and does not obey exactly @xmath0 s equation .",
    "it induces an alteration of the path integral formulation .",
    "moreover for @xmath6 @xmath19 does not exhibit the bosonization features of the known solution .",
    "however , following dirac s early analysis @xcite , the most general writing for @xmath19 is @xmath21 \\psi(y).\\ ] ] @xmath19 transforms as the original @xmath7 under a gauge transformation provided that @xmath22 there @xmath23 may have a matrix structure . to clarify the importance of this fact consider again @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the basic matrices are @xmath24 .",
    "the contributions due to @xmath25 can be eliminated in the lorentz gauge , for then one may look for @xmath23 under the form @xmath26 .",
    "hence the relevant term involves only @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "but at @xmath29 the longitudinal part of @xmath30 can be gauged away , only the transverse part matters and one has then @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32 and the linearity of @xmath33 in @xmath34 matrices has been used .",
    "@xmath19 writes now @xmath35\\int d^{(2)}y \\rho(y - x ) \\exp [ -i e \\gamma_5 \\phi(y ) ] \\psi(y)=\\exp [ i e   \\gamma_5 \\phi(x ) ] \\chi(x)$ ] .",
    "this is just the bosonization ansatz of the conventional theory and it is checked that @xmath19 still obeys @xmath36 , giving the usual anomaly and mass generation ( _ cf _ below ) . at @xmath37 @xmath38 can be a @xmath39 matrix built from @xmath40 . as for @xmath29 contributions from @xmath41 can be disregarded .",
    "clearly we do nt want @xmath23 to mix the chiralities of the original @xmath42 while preserving its equation of motion and gauge transformation property .",
    "this imposes a unique writing for @xmath19 as @xmath43\\ ] ] with @xmath44(1 \\pm \\gamma_{5})\\psi(y).\\ ] ] the solution of @xmath32 is now path independant and gives @xmath45 $ ] , which can not be gauged away @xcite .",
    "it is verified that @xmath19 obeys the classical @xmath0 original equation=0 , \\forall ( \\mu,\\nu)$ ] .",
    "whereas for @xmath46 the distinction between right and left - handed fermions is only technical , for @xmath47 the chirality will remain a conserved quantum number . ] thereby permitting a path integral formulation in terms of this `` smeared '' field .",
    "the question of charged particles and asymptotic states in gauge theories @xcite is now to be adressed with respect to this field .",
    "using the properties of @xmath34-matrices the right- and left - handed components can be recombined . with the variable change @xmath48 ' and @xmath49 , @xmath19 reads now @xmath50\\exp [ i p.x]\\tilde{\\psi}(p ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the neglected terms are of order @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the `` small '' radius of the ball , support of the test function @xmath53 . due to rotational symmetry its fourier",
    "transform depends on @xmath54 only and since @xmath55 it gives can not be pulled out of the integral since @xmath56 is a distribution . ]",
    "@xmath57\\tilde{\\psi}(p)+\\mathcal{o}(r^2)=\\int { d^{(d)}p \\over ( 2\\pi)^d}\\tilde{\\rho}(-\\not{\\!\\!\\!d}_{x}^2)\\exp [ i p.x]\\tilde{\\psi}(p)+ \\mathcal{o}(r^2)$].since the value of the mass is inessential in the sequel @xmath47 will be taken . in the path integral",
    "formalism the measure is now expressed in terms of the _ regularized _ complete set of eigenfunctions @xmath58 of the hermitian operator @xmath59 , since @xmath60 and the unregularized @xmath61 obey the same eigenvalue equation @xmath62 by construction .",
    "hence @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the analysis follows as usual @xcite , save for the fact that the quantity @xmath65 $ ] + @xmath66\\}$ ] is now finite due to the presence of test functions .",
    "the paracompactness property of the euclidean manifold implies that @xmath67 can be taken as a decomposition of unity which introduces a scale ( related to the inverse radius @xmath52 of the ball , support of test function in configuration space ) and in fact @xmath68 @xcite . in the limit @xmath69 @xmath70 reduces to @xmath71\\int { d^{4}y \\over ( 2\\pi)^4 } { d^2 \\over d^2(y^2)}[\\tilde{\\rho}^{2}(y^2)]={e^2 \\over 16 \\pi^2 } ^{\\,*}f^{\\mu \\nu}(x ) f_{\\mu \\nu}(x)$ ] , since @xmath72 ( decomposition of unity ) . at @xmath29 only the term in @xmath73 $ ] survives giving also the known result .",
    "whatever the importance of the non - perturbative anomaly test , it is well known that any type of regularisation in fourier space via damping functions at large momenta violates pertubatively gauge invariance and ward identities .",
    "this can be avoided if causality is implemented from the start in the construction of the s - matrix as advocated by epstein and glaser @xcite and scharf @xcite .",
    "this line of thought leads to use propagators with truly causal supports satisfaying dispersion relations being tantamount to substractions dictated by analyticity .",
    "it guarantees finite results and gauge invariance .",
    "moreover it is conceptually important to realize that the well established bphz renormalization scheme @xcite turns out to be a special case of the epstein - glaser prescription @xcite .",
    "for the special case of @xmath6 ( schwinger model ) the essential quantity is the causal polarization tensor whose form is @xcite @xmath74\\{tr[\\gamma_{\\mu}s^{(+)}(x)\\gamma_{\\nu}s^{(-)}(-x)]-(\\mu \\leftrightarrow   \\nu , x \\leftrightarrow -x)\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\!e^{2}[\\widehat{p}_{\\mu \\nu}(k)-(\\mu \\leftrightarrow \\nu , k \\leftrightarrow -k ) ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath75 are related to the usual feynman propagator @xmath76 corrected respectively by advanced and retarded pieces @xmath77   \\over ( p^2-m^2 \\mp i p^0 \\epsilon)}$ ] to give propagators with truly causal supports .",
    "they write explicitely @xmath78\\ ] ] with these expressions for @xmath75 and after tracing over the @xmath34 matrices @xmath79 becomes @xmath80.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral over @xmath81 is finite and @xmath82 .",
    "it is important to note the role of the @xmath83 functions in getting this result .",
    "they are specific to the form of the propagators @xmath75 .",
    "hence @xmath84 with @xmath85 causality imposes redefining @xmath86 through a one - time substracted dispersion relation @xmath87}\\big{]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath88 .",
    "the first term in @xmath89 comes from the substraction itself .",
    "hence @xmath90 , giving @xmath91 , _ ie _ the right boson mass . in the process it is essential to identify properly the singular order of the propagator to determine the substaction needed in the dispersion relation since it determines completly the limit @xmath92 . if not , then uv divergences and violation of gauge invariance will show up .",
    "the necessity of formulating quantum field theory in the continuum requires treating fields as opvd with specific test functions .",
    "thereby a non - standard regularization scheme is obtained which is in the line of the epstein and glaser extension of singular distributions . for abelian gauge theories",
    "the usual translation operation on distributions has been modified following dirac s early analysis of the possible phase factor leading to the proper gauge transformation of the initial fermi field itself .",
    "the procedure meets the necessary requirements of leaving the solution of the schwinger model unaltered and yet still permits a path integral formulation in terms of the smeared field .",
    "it provides naturally an interpretation of fujikawa s analysis of the abelian anomaly . finally recognizing the filiation of our approach with epstein and glaser s treatment indicates the essential role of causality in restoring gauge invariance which is otherwise violated by any regularisation with uv damping test functions only .",
    "this opens up the very interesting perspective of building up a gauge invariant lc - quantization framework free of divergences by construction from the outset .",
    "only finite renormalization will occur in connection with the intrinsic scale present in the decomposition of unity in fourier space or in the parametrization of epstein and glaser s weight function @xmath93 in configuration space .",
