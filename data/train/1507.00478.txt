    "two major challenges of contemporary particle physics are the search for beyond - standard model physics and a better understanding of the non - perturbative low - energy sector of the strong interaction .",
    "typically both aspects intermix when it comes to high - precision determinations of low - energy quantities and the corresponding standard model predictions .",
    "if a low - energy observable is potentially influenced by quantum effects from new particles , then it is also influenced by hadronic loop effects .",
    "the latter often  if not always  constitute the main uncertainty of the standard model prediction . on the other hand , new physics",
    "can only be revealed if a significant deviation between experiment and standard model calculation is observed .",
    "of course , this requires small uncertainties for both the experimental and the standard model result .",
    "our poor understanding of non - perturbative qcd could provide a serious hurdle for a reliable standard model calculation and/or for a reliable uncertainty estimate of such a calculation .",
    "two quantities of current interest which might indicate some deviation between experiment and the standard model are the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon  @xcite and the rare decay of the neutral pion into electron and positron  @xcite .",
    "an important quantity that enters both observables is the pion transition form factor , i.e.  the three - point correlator between a neutral pion and two electromagnetic currents .",
    "two tasks are carried out in the present work : first , the pion - vector - vector ( @xmath1 ) correlator is determined by combining high - energy quark - based information with low(er)-energy hadronic information .",
    "we follow the general approach proposed in  @xcite with some refinements .",
    "second , we explore some phenomenological consequences of our correlator and focus in particular on the rare pion decay @xmath13 . here",
    "we include also qed radiative corrections along the lines of  @xcite .",
    "two limits of qcd are of particular interest for low - energy hadron physics : the chiral limit where the masses of the two or three lightest quarks are neglected  @xcite and the limit where the number of quark colors , @xmath14 , is sent to infinity  @xcite .",
    "concerning the @xmath1 correlator the chiral anomaly fixes the low - energy strength unambiguously in the chiral limit . for a large number of colors",
    "there are infinitely many , infinitely narrow , i.e.  stable , quark - antiquark states for every combination of quantum numbers .",
    "they show up as poles in the @xmath15-point correlators of quark currents . in the real world of three colors",
    "the hadrons generically turn to unstable resonances because the hadronic interactions do not vanish any more .",
    "the poles in the correlators turn to cuts ( and poles in other riemann sheets ) .",
    "the cuts start at the corresponding many - body thresholds .",
    "thus the relevance of the large-@xmath14 limit for the real world is highest , if one considers hadrons which are narrow and/or kinematical regions where there are no ( significant ) cuts .",
    "this is our guiding principle when exploring phenomenological consequences .",
    "concerning form factors there are no cuts in the space - like region .    in the standard model the rare decay of the pion into electron and positron",
    "is caused by a loop where the pion first turns into a pair of ( real or virtual ) photons ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : piee ] below . at this vertex",
    "the pion transition form factor sneaks in .",
    "if the form factor was replaced by a constant , the loop would diverge  @xcite .",
    "in qcd the pion transition form factor is suppressed for large virtualities  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a finite result for the @xmath11-@xmath16-@xmath17 amplitude at the one - loop level of the standard model calculation .",
    "thus for a quantitative determination of the branching ratio of the considered rare pion decay it is necessary to know where and how fast the pion transition form factor reaches its asymptotic form which in turn depends on the various combinations of virtualities .",
    "these considerations show that one needs information from various qcd regimes : the threshold regime governed by the chiral anomaly , the regime of hadronic resonances , and , finally , the regime of asymptotically high energies dictated by quarks and asymptotic freedom .",
    "these regimes are connected in the approach of  @xcite where the operator product expansion ( ope ) for various three - point correlators of quark currents is matched to a hadronic ansatz that satisfies the chiral constraints for the low - energy limit .",
    "this ansatz is furthermore based on a truncation of the infinite tower of stable hadronic states that appears in the limit of a large number of colors .    in principle",
    "one can work out arbitrary many orders in the ope and match to the parameters that emerge with the tower of hadron states .",
    "however , the higher orders in the ope contain unknown quark and gluon condensates of high dimensionality .",
    "thus in practice the model dependence emerges from a selection of the to be matched ope constraints and from the choice where to truncate the tower of hadron states .",
    "using one hadron multiplet per channel and leading - order ope constraints has been studied in detail in  @xcite .",
    "this truncation is called `` lowest - meson dominance '' ( lmd ) . in the present work we will explore the consequences of having two hadron multiplets per channel . in the language of",
    "@xcite our approach would be called `` lmd+v+p '' . to avoid this clumsy name",
    "we decided to introduce the name `` two - hadron saturation '' ( ths ) .",
    "concerning our quantity of interest , the @xmath1 correlator and the corresponding pion transition form factor , the starting point on the level of quark currents is the pseudoscalar - vector - vector ( @xmath0 ) correlator .",
    "the consequences of lmd for this quantity have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "an application to the rare pion decay to electron and positron was presented in  @xcite .",
    "two vector multiplets have also been considered in  @xcite ; see also  @xcite where this has been used for the rare pion decay .",
    "what makes our approach different from previous works is that we explore in detail the consequence of two multiplets in _ each _ channel and that we fit and/or compare to data on the @xmath18 correlator .",
    "in fact , including a second multiplet in the vector channel involves the energy region of about 1.4 gev @xcite . in this region",
    "there is also a pseudoscalar multiplet .",
    "thus the extension from lmd to two multiplets for a channel suggests to use two multiplets for _ every _ channel . concerning the second aspect , the interrelation to the @xmath18 correlator",
    ", we will come back to this issue below , after discussing in more detail the pertinent high - energy constraints .",
    "there is yet one more short - distance limit to be considered . instead of studying the high - energy limit of correlators of quark currents ( ope )",
    ", one can also study the high - energy limit of correlators that involve specific asymptotic states like hadrons or photons together with one or several quark currents .",
    "in particular the high - energy behavior of the pion - photon - vector correlator has recently gained much attention since the babar data  @xcite seem to contradict the brodsky  lepage ( b - l ) scaling limit  @xcite while the belle data  @xcite seem to support it .    using ths we are able to satisfy all leading - order ope constraints for the @xmath0 correlator and in addition the b - l constraint for the pion - photon - vector correlator . while lmd satisfies the same ope constraints",
    ", it violates the b - l constraint as can be easily deduced from the explicit form given in  @xcite ; see also the discussion in  @xcite . as we will show below",
    ", the constraints from the leading order of the ope , from b - l and from the chiral anomaly together fix the ths approach to the @xmath1 correlator up to one single parameter , which we call @xmath19 .",
    "if the invariant mass of one of the vector currents in this correlator is set to zero , i.e.  for the pion - photon - vector correlator , then @xmath19 drops out .",
    "in other words we have full predictive power for this correlator .",
    "aiming at the rare pion decay into electron and positron one needs the full information on the @xmath1 correlator for arbitrary invariant masses of the two vector currents . in principle , the parameter @xmath19 would be best determined from data on the @xmath1 correlator with both invariant masses being different from real photons .",
    "unfortunately such data do not exist .",
    "in this situation we turn to the second - best choice . projecting the @xmath1 correlator on one of the vector mesons that we include in ths",
    "yields a 3-point correlator for the pion , the vector meson and a quark current with vector quantum numbers . given that our approach is based on the large-@xmath14 limit where mesons are approximated by infinitely narrow states , it is suggestive to use a narrow vector meson . since phenomenologically and in the large-@xmath14",
    "limit the pion decouples from the @xmath20 meson  @xcite , we are left with the @xmath4 meson as the best choice for a vector meson .",
    "consequently we will use data on the @xmath4-@xmath5 transition form factor  @xcite to fix our remaining parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath1 correlator obtained in this way from ths shows an awesome behavior : if the virtuality of one vector current becomes large while the other is set to zero ( photon case ) , the asymptotic b - l limit is reached rather fast , resembling essentially strict vector - meson dominance ( vmd )  @xcite . the scale that defines where the approach to the asymptotic limit sets in is basically given by the mass of the @xmath21/@xmath4 meson . on the other hand ,",
    "if both vector currents have the same large virtuality , the corresponding asymptotic limit is reached very late for the @xmath1 correlator as obtained from ths .",
    "this finding points to the relevance of details of hadronic physics above 1 gev . for this case",
    "the @xmath1 correlator from vmd falls off much faster than demanded by qcd , while for lmd the asymptotic limit is reached much earlier than for ths .",
    "since the rare decay @xmath13 is sensitive to both high- and low - energy physics , it is interesting to study how this intriguing behavior of the @xmath1 correlator obtained from ths influences the branching ratio of this rare process .",
    "before going into the details of our findings we shall compare our approach to related ones from the literature .",
    "the @xmath4-@xmath5 transition form factor and related quantities have also been addressed in  @xcite where the ground - state vector mesons are treated as light degrees of freedom . by construction",
    "the approach is restricted to low energies , i.e.  high - energy constraints were not considered .",
    "nonetheless , it turns out that the ths result for the @xmath4-@xmath5 transition form factor is numerically very close to the one from  @xcite .",
    "conceptually close in spirit to ths is the lagrangian approach utilized , e.g. , in  @xcite ( earlier references can be traced back from these works ) .",
    "also here hadron resonances in the large-@xmath14 limit are used to interpolate between the low - energy region governed by chiral perturbation theory and the high - energy region governed by the ope or quark scaling considerations . in",
    "@xcite a @xmath0 and a corresponding @xmath1 correlator are constructed with one multiplet in the vector channel and two multiplets in the pseudoscalar channel ( i.e.  the goldstone bosons and one resonance multiplet ) . for an extension to two multiplets in the vector channel",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 correlator from  @xcite satisfies the b - l constraint , but the @xmath0 correlator satisfies only one leading - order ope constraint , not all of them . as shown in  @xcite the lagrangian utilized in @xcite is not capable to provide correlators that satisfy all ope constraints ; see also the discussion in  @xcite . instead of the other ope constraints on the @xmath0 correlator a high - energy constraint based on quark counting rules",
    "is imposed on the @xmath22 correlator in  @xcite .    in our work",
    "we impose high - energy constraints on the @xmath0 correlator ( ths satisfies _ all _ leading - order ope constraints ) and on the @xmath1 correlator ( the b - l limit ) , but not on the @xmath22 or @xmath23 correlator .",
    "our philosophy is that we take the first multiplets to resemble the corresponding ground - state physical particles but the second multiplets to mimic the effect of the tower of infinitely many excited states .",
    "since we study with @xmath0 an order parameter of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite one expects that the second multiplets are close to the physical states that are the first excitations on top of the ground states .",
    "however , the weighted average of the whole tower of states might shift the effective mass higher up . in the present work",
    "we explore the uncertainty of the ths approximation by changing the masses of the second multiplets from the first to the second physical excitations . concerning the @xmath1 correlator we expect to obtain reasonable results because the pion might not resolve too many details of the intermediate - energy region . thus replacing the tower of excited resonances by the respective lowest excitation and demanding high - energy constraints for the @xmath1 correlator might be good enough .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath22 or @xmath23 correlator resolves more from the intermediate - energy region because the vector meson induces a larger mass scale .",
    "( the same would apply to a @xmath24 correlator . ) therefore to satisfy high - energy constraints in this case we expect that one would need a more detailed modeling than just having ths , i.e.  one excitation ( plus the ground state ) in each channel .",
    "it might be worth to explore a three - hadron saturation scenario , but this is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "therefore we demand constraints on the @xmath0 and @xmath1 correlators , but disregard constraints for three - point correlators of one pseudoscalar meson , one vector meson and one vector quark current .",
    "for the same reason we only consider leading , but not subleading high - energy / ope constraints .    from a formal point of view",
    "our approach is close to the successive pad approximations as utilized , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "our correlators are also approximated by rational functions . in our approach , however , the poles of the correlators are related to physical states ( in the large-@xmath14 limit ) . in contrast ,",
    "in the pad framework of @xcite one determines the rational functions by fits to data .",
    "it is not the purpose of this pad approach to look for the poles of the obtained rational functions .",
    "in fact , there are no physical restrictions from outside that would make sure that these poles correspond in any way to physical hadrons . but",
    "this is what s - matrix theory suggests ( in the large-@xmath14 limit ) : anything beyond polynomials should be caused by unitarity , analyticity , crossing symmetry and physical states .",
    "our work is complementary to the dispersion theoretical approach of  @xcite ; see also @xcite . while we can not expect to reach the accuracy of a dispersive approach concerning low - energy quantities , our framework has the advantage to provide a smooth and physical connection between the low- and high - energy region and between the quark based and hadron based correlators . in practice ,",
    "dispersive calculations are based on an excellent account of the low - energy region ( up to about 1 gev ) and a high - energy completion , i.e.  a matching to the high - energy behavior deduced from s - matrix theory , qcd or qcd related approaches ; see the discussion in  @xcite concerning the @xmath1 correlator .",
    "as already discussed , for our doubly virtual @xmath1 correlator there are regions in the virtualities where the asymptotic regime is reached only at very high energies . in practice this might imply that a naive matching of a dispersive calculation to the asymptotic regime might miss part of the physics present at intermediate energies .",
    "clearly it is worth to explore the interplay of a dispersive calculation with ths in the future .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured in the following way : in section  [ sec : ff ] we construct the @xmath0 and @xmath1 correlators subject to high- and low - energy constraints . the results for the @xmath1 correlator are compared to data and to other approaches ( lmd and vmd ) .",
    "it is studied how the shape of the correlator changes when varying the remaining free parameter @xmath19 in a reasonable range .",
    "in addition , a model uncertainty is estimated by varying the mass of the second vector - meson multiplet between the _ physical _ masses of the first and second excitation .    in section  [ sec : pheno ]",
    "the @xmath23 correlator is constructed .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is determined from a fit to the @xmath4-@xmath5 transition form factor .",
    "the widths or branching ratios , respectively , for the corresponding decays @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are determined for ths ( and also for lmd and vmd ) . actually the first decay does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "we find good agreement between ths and the experimental results .",
    "we address the rare pion decay to electron and positron in section  [ sec : piee ] . including radiative corrections the branching ratio of this process is calculated and we compare again the ths result to other approaches . for the ths case",
    "this branching ratio is sensitive to @xmath19 .",
    "direct comparison to the experimental value from ktev @xcite seems to suggest that a discrepancy persists on the level of 2@xmath12 .    in section  [ sec : pieegam ] we study the properties of the singly virtual pion transition form factor in the low - energy region , such as slope and curvature .",
    "note that these quantities do not depend on the parameter @xmath19 .",
    "for the dalitz decay @xmath28 we calculate the decay width taking into account next - to - leading order ( nlo ) radiative corrections .",
    "these are evaluated along the lines of @xcite .",
    "again we compare ths to other approaches . with the full set of radiative corrections at hand , we take a fresh look on the ktev result . considering some radiative corrections that were not accounted for in the analysis",
    "suggests that the previously stated discrepancy might be even reduced to 1.5@xmath12 .",
    "the main message here , however , is that the radiative corrections are now theoretically under control @xcite and can be used in future data analyses .    in section  [ sec : outlook ]",
    "we provide an outlook how ths can be further utilized and how the scheme can be extended .",
    "finally , an appendix is added to provide the pseudoscalar form factors in terms of the loop integrals required for the rare pion decay .    comparing in detail various approaches throughout the present work",
    "reveals that the vmd form factor proves to be phenomenologically very successful in most applications , in spite of the facts that vmd is so simple and partially possesses an improper high - energy behavior .",
    "however , the ths form factor , which satisfies all the considered constraints , works very well , too . still , the mean value of the ktev result remains a challenge for all approaches , even though the discrepancy has been reduced by a considerable level .",

    "is sufficient inasmuch as higher powers of momenta in the numerator are not allowed due to the desired high - energy behavior that we will specify below .",
    "thus we start with a term containing 22 monomials and associated free parameters .",

    "the masses of the lowest two vector - meson multiplets are denoted by @xmath44 and @xmath45 . as already spelled out in section  [ sec : intro ]",
    "we use for @xmath44 the mass of the ground - state vector - meson multiplet ( in the chiral limit ) .",
    "we assume that this mass is approximately given by the mass of the @xmath4 or @xmath21 meson .",
    "for @xmath45 it is suggestive to use the physical mass of the first excitation in the vector channel .",

    "finally we note that the same logic applies to the mass @xmath43 of the second pseudoscalar multiplet . for the @xmath0 correlator one should study the impact of a variation of @xmath43 .",
    "as we will see below , however , this mass does not show up in the final expression for the @xmath1 correlator .",
    "we now demand that the ansatz ( [ eq : corr ] ) satisfies all the relevant high- as well as low - energy constraints in order to minimize the number of free parameters introduced in ( [ eq : poly ] ) .",
    "starting with the general correlator ( [ eq : corr ] ) we apply the following leading - order ope constraints  @xcite : @xmath47 @xmath48 it turns out that the third ope constraint @xcite @xmath49 is automatically fulfilled by our ansatz . here",

    "however , we refrain from incorporating this as an additional constraint .",
    "the reason is the same as to why we do not use constraints from transition form factors of hadronic resonance states .",
    "one might become too sensitive to the details of the intermediate mass region where we use one hadronic state to describe effectively the whole infinite tower of large-@xmath14 excited states .",
    "if one used three instead of two hadronic states per channel , the subleading high - energy constraints might provide a viable input to pin down the growing number of resonance parameters .",

    "the ths results start to undershoot vmd at low virtualities . moving to even lower @xmath19 values",
    "there is always a region where the ths result becomes negative .",

    "is varied within the respective experimentally allowed regions , @xmath77 as described in the next section , and @xmath45 is varied within region ( [ eq : rangev2 ] ) .",
    "the whole gray band in the first panel shows the qualitative behavior described previously .",
    "it also points to a significant quantitative uncertainty of our prediction for the symmetric doubly virtual pion transition form factor .",
    "in other words , data on this form factor or in general on any doubly virtual pion transition form factor would be highly welcome to better constrain our approach .    in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] we display the singly virtual pion transition form factor .",
    "this plot shows two lines , a very narrow gray band and data .",
    "we first discuss the gray band , which nearly resembles a full line since its width is so small .",
    "obviously the narrow gray band of the second panel contrasts with the rather broad band of the first panel .",
    "however , the singly virtual pion transition form factor is independent of @xmath19 as can be easily deduced from ( [ eq : fffinal2 ] ) when putting @xmath52 to zero .",
    "the largest uncertainty comes from a variation of @xmath45 according to ( [ eq : rangev2 ] ) .",
    "even this variation does not lead to very different results , which causes the curves to nearly collapse to one single line .",
    "thus ths has rather high predictive ( or rather _ postdictive _ ) power for the singly virtual pion transition form factor .",
    "another qualitative difference between the gray bands of the first and the second panel is the fact that the ths result for the singly virtual pion transition form factor reaches the asymptotic ( b - l ) limit rather early .",
    "we regard this intriguing behavior of our correlator as one of the highlights of our work : the ths pion transition form factor shows an early ( late ) onset of the asymptotic behavior for the singly ( symmetric doubly ) virtual pion transition form factor .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to see if this is supported by data in the future .",
    "finally , we compare the ths result for the singly virtual pion transition form factor to vmd and lmd and to data .",
    "the lmd result for @xmath78 behaves as a constant for large @xmath79 .",
    "thus , it can not even qualitatively explain the data since , of course , it diverges after being multiplied by @xmath51 .",
    "this behavior can be seen in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] where the lmd result is given by the dash - dotted line .",
    "the results for vmd ( dashed line ) and ths are fairly close .",
    "cleo data  @xcite are only available for low virtualities ( @xmath80gev@xmath81 ) and prefer vmd to some extent though ths appears to be acceptable as well .",
    "the situation turns around for higher virtualities .",
    "ths describes the belle data  @xcite better than vmd .",
    "the early onset of the asymptotic behavior of the ths result for the singly virtual pion transition form factor makes ths essentially identical to the b - l limit .",
    "not surprisingly then , ths agrees well with the belle data and is at odds with the babar data  @xcite that are not fully compatible with the belle data .",
    "we do not attempt to contribute to a clarification of the differences between belle and babar . in view of these complications",
    "we have decided to stick to the b - l constraint ( [ eq : bl ] ) right from the start .",
    "our strategy now is to obtain the parameter @xmath19 of the newly proposed @xmath1 correlator ( [ eq : fffinal2 ] ) from the @xmath23 correlator .",
    "thus we turn to @xmath4 data for the reasons specified in section  [ sec : intro ] , namely the lack of doubly virtual data for the pion transition form factor and the fact that the @xmath4 meson is fairly long lived to resemble the situation of the large-@xmath14 approximation .",
    "we introduce the overlap between an @xmath4 meson and the vector current @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 where we assume that the @xmath4 meson does not contain hidden strangeness , which is a fairly good approximation to the real world @xcite . for later convenience",
    "we also define the @xmath84-@xmath4 coupling strength @xmath85 the modulus of which agrees with @xmath86 as introduced in  @xcite .    with this at hand we can obtain @xmath87 from the @xmath88 decay process . a direct calculation from the lorentz invariant matrix element @xmath89 yields after averaging and summing over polarizations @xmath90^{-\\frac12}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the speed of the electron in the rest frame of the decaying @xmath4 meson .",
    "taking into account that @xmath92 , we can write @xmath93 using the values @xmath94 and @xmath95mev  @xcite we find @xmath96kev .",
    "together with @xmath97mev we obtain from ( [ eq : fv1 ] ) the following value for the coupling strength : @xmath98    it is convenient to introduce the @xmath18 transition form factor by @xmath99 this turns out to be the central quantity to determine @xmath19 and to address the phenomenologically interesting decays @xmath3 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 denotes a lepton .    for the special case when @xmath102 we find ( see also @xcite for a similar expression for the case of one vector multiplet ) @xmath103\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "hence the decay width for @xmath3 is independent of @xmath19 , which provides us with full predictive power for this particular decay and can therefore serve as a cross - check of our formalism .",
    "we will come back to this decay after having determined @xmath19 from the measured @xmath4-@xmath5 transition form factor .",
    "in fact , the parameter @xmath19 , which constitutes the only unknown parameter of our proposed @xmath1 correlator , can be obtained by a fit to the na60 data @xcite for the normalized transition form factor @xmath104 in the low - energy time - like region of @xmath51 with the result @xmath105 the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffomega ] as a gray band .",
    "the uncertainty comes mainly from the fitting procedure ( and so from the error bars of the data ) and from the variation of the second - multiplet mass @xmath106 inside the considered region ( [ eq : rangev2 ] ) .",
    "our fit to the na60 data has a @xmath107 per degree of freedom of 1.5 .",
    "apparently we obtain a rather satisfying fit to the na60 data except for the last two or three data points at the largest values of the dimuon mass . at present , none of the hadron - theory approaches to this @xmath4 transition form factor @xcite is able to understand these last data points .",
    "recently it has been suggested in @xcite using a dispersive calculation and high - energy constraints that these data points might be incompatible with qcd .",
    "clearly it would be highly desirable to obtain additional data for this @xmath4 transition form factor , in particular from experiments where the complete final state @xmath108 can be reconstructed and not only the dilepton ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "in the following we will stick to our result for @xmath19 as given in ( [ eq : kappa ] ) and obtained from a fit to the full range of na60 data since it is the best that one can do in the present situation .",
    "however , we briefly discuss two alternatives : if we performed an alternative fit to the na60 data rejecting the last three data points , we would get @xmath109 , which is fairly compatible with our full fit .",
    "the @xmath107 per degree of freedom would reduce to 0.8 .",
    "if we rejected the na60 data altogether and regarded the dispersive calculation of @xcite as the `` truth '' , we would find @xmath110 .",
    "the result of this last fit is also shown in fig .  [ fig : ffomega ] as the dark gray band . if we return to the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] we observe that one obtains the same qualitative features with such values of @xmath19 .",
    "nevertheless , we will not use these results further on and will take into account only the result ( [ eq : kappa ] ) of the all - data fit .",
    "as for the pion transition form factor we shall compare our result to similar approaches from the literature .",
    "the form factor from @xcite , @xmath111 labeled by `` tl '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffomega ] , lies within our uncertainty band in spite of the fact that the derivation is based on a very different approach .",
    "the results for vmd and lmd can be obtained from ( [ eq : ffvmd ] ) and ( [ eq : fflmd ] ) , respectively , using ( [ eq : ffq2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ompinorm ] ) .",
    "for instance , the vmd expression is @xmath112 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ffomega ] the results for both vmd and lmd deviate significantly from the data and therefore from our approach .",

    "order @xmath148 might help to obtain an agreement between a lagrangian approach and the ope .",
    "needless to say that the systematic construction of a @xmath148 lagrangian would be extremely tedious ; see  @xcite and references therein . in practice , according to @xcite , leading - order ope constraints together with a singly virtual pion transition form factor that vanishes at large momenta can be achieved by a resonance lagrangian with two vector - meson multiplets in the antisymmetric tensor representation .",
