    "although studies of its perturbative regime show that qcd is the theory of strong interactions , most of the structures of nuclear physics are apparent only at low energies where the qcd coupling constant is not small .",
    "another expansion parameter is necessary in this energy regime , and an obvious candidate is energy itself .",
    "the idea of a low - energy expansion is as old as nuclear physics itself .",
    "already in the 30 s , bethe and peierls @xcite considered the two - nucleon system in this light .",
    "they based their approach on a previous argument about saturation due to wigner , that the nuclear potential is of order 100 mev and thus much larger than the deuteron binding energy of 2.2 mev , but has a range @xmath0 ( @xmath1 1.4 fm ) much smaller than the size @xmath2 of the deuteron ( @xmath1 4.4 fm ) .",
    "bethe and peierls reasoned that as a consequence , for distances @xmath3 such that @xmath4 , only s - waves are important and the sole effect of the potential is to provide an energy independent boundary condition at @xmath5 .",
    "up to an error of @xmath6 , then , the system could be described by a free schrdinger equation with the boundary condition that the logarithmic derivative of the radial wavefunction is a constant at @xmath7 .",
    "this constant can not be calculated without detailed knowledge of the potential , so it was fitted to the deuteron binding energy .",
    "if that was all , nothing would have been learned .",
    "bethe and peierls point , however , was that they could then predict ( with a 30% uncertainty ) other processes such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 at energies comparable to the deuteron binding energy .",
    "this approach can be rephrased in an effective field theory ( eft ) language . at typical momenta @xmath12",
    "much smaller than the pion mass @xmath13 , the relevant degree of freedom is the nucleon , the important symmetries are parity , time - reversal and galilean symmetry , and the appropriate expansion parameter is @xmath14 .",
    "( electromagnetic processes can also be considered by adding the photon , @xmath15 gauge invariance , and @xmath16 to this list . )",
    "the most general lagrangian involving nucleons only consists of an infinite number of terms , which are quadratic , quartic , ... , in the nucleon fields with increasing number of derivatives . by dimensional reasons ,",
    "derivatives come associated with inverse factors of a mass scale @xmath13 or greater .",
    "nucleons are non - relativistic and the corresponding field theory has nucleon number conservation .",
    "the @xmath17-matrix for the two - nucleon system is simply a sum of bubble graphs , whose vertices are the four - nucleon contact terms that appear in the lagrangian .",
    "formally , this is equivalent to solving a schrdinger equation with a low - energy , effective potential consisting , schematically , of a sum @xmath18 , where the @xmath19 s are the coefficients of the contact terms , expected to scale as @xmath20 .",
    "the net effect is thus to replace the `` true '' , possibly complicated potential of range @xmath21 by a multipole expansion with moments @xmath19 .",
    "life is somewhat more complicated , however , because this field theory , like any other , has to be renormalized .",
    "the bubbles are actually ultraviolet divergent , requiring regularization and absorption of the regulator dependence in renormalized parameters .",
    "it is not difficult to show @xcite that the effect of renormalization is to turn the effective potential into a generalized pseudo - potential , or equivalently , turn the problem into a free one with boundary conditions at the origin which are analytic in the energy .",
    "the first , energy - independent term , parametrized by @xmath22 , is just the one considered by bethe and peierls .",
    "much effort has been spent during the last year in trying to understand issues related to regularization and fine - tuning of this `` pionless '' theory @xcite .    to the extent",
    "that there are no assumptions about the detailed dynamics of the `` underlying '' theory , the effective theory can not be wrong and it is useful as long as @xmath23 .",
    "one may ask how strong this restriction is , however , when we consider physics of more than two nucleons .",
    "clearly , we can always apply the pionless theory to sufficiently low - energy scattering situations , where we can control the momenta of the initial and final nucleons .",
    "but one noble goal of nuclear physics is to understand nuclei themselves .",
    "let me use @xmath24 as a measure of a typical momentum @xmath12 of a nucleon of mass @xmath25 in a nucleus with @xmath26 nucleons and binding energy @xmath27 .",
    "( other quantities such as charge radii give similar estimates . )",
    "@xmath28 is then about 0.3 for @xmath29h , 0.5 for @xmath30h , 0.8 for @xmath31he , ... , and 1.2 for symmetric nuclear matter in equilibrium . the same argument that justified the use of a pionless theory for the deuteron now suggests that understanding the binding of typical nuclei ( @xmath31he and heavier ) requires _ explicit _ inclusion of pions , but _ not _ of heavier mesons such as the rho .",
    "now , we are in luck because qcd does explain the special role of the pion , and in the process , provides a rationale to treat pion effects systematically .",
    "this procedure goes by the name of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath32pt ) ; it will be described briefly in the next section , and exemplified even more briefly in the simplest case of at most one nucleon in the following section .",
    "i then come to the main portion of this review , where we tackle nuclear forces and external probes of light nuclei .",
    "why is the pion special ? it is one of the nicest features of qcd that it provides a scenario where the lightness of the pion results from its ( pseudo- ) goldstone boson nature . here for simplicity i will limit myself to the case of two quark flavors .",
    "if the quark masses were zero ( `` chiral limit '' ) , the qcd lagrangian would be invariant under transformations of the group @xmath33 of independent rotations of the quarks left- and right - handed components .",
    "when acting on quark bilinears , this chiral symmetry is equivalent to @xmath34 .",
    "a quick look at the hadronic spectrum convinces us that the chiral limit can only be phenomenologically relevant if there is spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry down to its diagonal subgroup , the @xmath35 ( @xmath36 for bilinears ) of isospin .",
    "although the mechanism of spontaneous breaking is not sufficiently understood at the present for a detailed derivation , we know that the effective qcd potential as a function of four quark bilinears @xmath37 has to have roughly a mexican hat shape , i.e. @xmath34 symmetry with minima in a `` chiral circle '' away from the origin .",
    "goldstone s theorem assures us there is in the spectrum , as a consequence , a ( pseudo-)scalar boson , which corresponds to excitations in the coset space @xmath38 .",
    "we call the radius of this `` circle '' @xmath39 , which is a function of @xmath40 that ends up being the pion decay constant @xmath41 mev . at sufficiently low energies",
    "it is convenient to assign a field @xmath42 to the pion in the effective lagrangian .",
    "an infinitesimal chiral transformation is of the form @xmath43 . @xmath34",
    "symmetry of the dynamics implies that the lagrangian will have a piece that is a function of @xmath42 only through derivatives of @xmath42 on the circle , which are non - linear .",
    "the lagrangian , in principle completely determined by @xmath40 , has an infinite number of terms with arbitrarily high pion self - interactions , but without a pion mass term .    we know , however , that not all quark masses are zero .",
    "quark masses generate two terms in the qcd lagrangian .",
    "one term , @xmath44 with @xmath45 , is the fourth component of an @xmath34 vector and therefore breaks @xmath34 explicitly down to @xmath46 of isospin .",
    "it causes a tilt of the effective potential in the @xmath47 direction determined by the small parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the effective lagrangian will acquire then a piece that breaks @xmath34 explicitly in the same way as @xmath47 .",
    "this piece is another infinite set of terms that do depend on @xmath42 in an isospin invariant way , but are all proportional to powers of @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , @xmath50 . the other quark mass term , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , is the third component of another @xmath34 vector and further breaks @xmath46 down to @xmath53 .",
    "likewise , the effective lagrangian will inherit yet another infinite set of terms , this time that break isospin as @xmath54 and are , in principle , of order @xmath55 relative to the isospin conserving chiral breaking effects .",
    "why isospin breaking is in fact much smaller in most observables will be explained later .",
    "qcd therefore has all the ingredients to provide a rationale not only for the special role of the pion , but also for a systematic treatment of its effects : pion interactions are weak at low energies due to ( approximate ) chiral symmetry .",
    "we can now formulate an eft for momenta @xmath56 along the same lines of the pionless case .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom besides non - relativistic nucleons and photons are obviously pions and also non - relativistic delta isobars , since the delta - nucleon mass difference @xmath57 is of the order of the momenta @xmath12 we want to consider .",
    "the new and very important symmetry is approximate @xmath33 .",
    "the expansion parameter is expected to be @xmath58 besides @xmath16 .",
    "the most general lagrangian with these ingredients has schematically the form @xmath59 here the @xmath60 s are parameters assumed to be natural , i.e. of @xmath61 or @xmath62 with @xmath63 a positive integer , in the case of isospin breaking operators originating in the quark mass difference .",
    "@xmath64 stands for a nucleon or delta isobar , and @xmath65 for a covariant derivative .",
    "the interactions are naturally grouped in sets @xmath66 of common index @xmath67 but arbitrary values of @xmath68 . for non - electromagnetic interactions , we find that @xmath69 only because of chiral symmetry .",
    "consider an arbitrary irreducible contribution to a process involving @xmath26 nucleons and an arbitrary number of pions and photons , all with momenta of order @xmath12 .",
    "it can be represented by a feynman diagram with @xmath26 continuous nucleon lines , @xmath70 loops , @xmath60 separately connected pieces , and @xmath71 vertices from @xmath66 , whose connected pieces can not be all split by cutting only nucleon lines .",
    "( @xmath72 for @xmath73 ; @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "the reason to consider irreducible diagrams and @xmath76 will be discussed in the section on few - nucleon systems . )",
    "it is easy to show @xcite that this contribution is typically of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 since @xmath70 is bounded from below ( 0 ) and @xmath60 from above ( @xmath79 ) , the chiral symmetry constraint @xmath69 implies that @xmath80 for strong interactions .",
    "leading contributions come from tree diagrams built out of @xmath81 and coincide with current algebra .",
    "perturbation theory in @xmath58 can be carried out by considering contributions from ever increasing @xmath82 .    note that this approach is :    ( _ i _ ) systematic .",
    "it is a _ perturbation _ in the number of loops , derivatives / fermion fields , and many - nucleon effects .",
    "( _ ii _ ) consistent with qcd .",
    "the only ( very important ) qcd inputs are confinement ( color singlet fields ) , symmetries ( _ chiral _ , ... ) , and naturalness .",
    "qcd can be represented by a point in the space of renormalized parameters ( at some renormalization scale ) of the effective theory .",
    "an explicit solution of qcd ( such as from simulations on a lattice ) would provide knowledge of the exact position of this point , and then the effective theory would be completely predictive . until such a solution is found or as a test of qcd after it is found we can recourse to fitting low - energy experiments in order to determine the region in parameter space allowed on phenomenological grounds . even in this case",
    "the theory is predictive , because to any given order the space of parameters is finite - dimensional . after a finite number of experimental results",
    "are used , an infinite number of others can be predicted up to an accuracy depending on the order of the expansion . in practice , because the number of parameters grows rapidly with the order , model - dependent estimates of parameters based on specific dynamic ideas such as saturation by tree - level resonance exchange are sometimes used .",
    "( _ iii _ ) a _ theory_. it is applicable in principle to all low - energy phenomena .",
    "i will in the next section mention some of the highlights of this program for processes with at most one nucleon , and then most of the rest of the paper is devoted to nuclear physics _ per se_.",
    "in the case of strong mesonic processes , @xmath83 with @xmath84 increasing in steps of two . since weinberg discovered this systematic generalization of current algebra @xcite and gasser and leutwyler implemented it @xcite , many processes ( including weak interactions ) involving pions ( and kaons ) have been examined , typically to @xmath85 .",
    "the most thoroughly studied process has been @xmath86 scattering , where a @xmath87 calculation was carried out @xcite ; fits to other data plus resonance saturation show convergence and good agreement with phase shifts through energies of more than 100 mev above threshold .",
    "many good reviews exist on the mesonic sector ; see for example ref .",
    "@xcite .    for processes where one nucleon is present , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 ) increases in steps of one .",
    "( convergence can be expected to be slower compared to purely mesonic interactions . )",
    "thanks to this power counting , a low - energy nucleon can in a very definite sense be pictured as a static , point - like object ( up to corrections in powers of @xmath91 ) , surrounded by : i ) an inner cloud which is dense but of short range @xmath92 , so that we can expand in its relative size @xmath93 ; ii ) an outer cloud of long range @xmath21 but sparse , so that we can expand in its relative strength @xmath94 .    the first attempt at including the nucleon in @xmath32pt @xcite had limited success because it did not fully explore the non - relativistic nature of the nucleon and did not consider the delta isobar explicitly .",
    "this was remedied in the work of jenkins and manohar @xcite , while a more complete analysis of the role of the delta in one - nucleon process has been carried out recently @xcite .",
    "however , most calculations have been limited to the threshold region where the delta contribution is relatively unimportant and a `` deltaless '' theory useful ; see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for an extensive review .    here , for illustration ,",
    "i mention explicitly the case of pion photoproduction at threshold which has received a lot of attention lately . at threshold the amplitude for a photon of polarization @xmath95",
    "incident on a nucleon of spin @xmath96 is @xmath97 .",
    "this process has been studied up to @xmath85 in the deltaless theory in ref .",
    "@xcite ( where references to the experimental papers can be found ; see also ref .",
    "results for @xmath98 from a fit constrained by resonance saturation are presented in table [ t : vkolck : e0 + ] .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the fair agreement of this first calculation and data up to laboratory energies of 100 mev or so suggests that this may become an alternative to other , more model - dependent approaches to the two - nucleon problem .",
    "further examination of regularization effects , fine - tuning in the @xmath100 channel , and different aspects of two - pion exchange in this context can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "perhaps more impressive is that we can get some insight into other aspects of nuclear forces .",
    "let us look for the new forces that appear in systems with more than two nucleons .",
    "the dominant potential , at @xmath101 , is the two - nucleon potential of lowest order that appeared in the two - nucleon case .",
    "we can easily verify that a three - body potential will arise at @xmath102 , a four - body potential at @xmath103 , and so on .",
    "it is ( approximate ) chiral symmetry therefore that implies that @xmath104-nucleon forces @xmath105 are expected to obey a hierarchy of the type @xmath106 , with @xmath107 denoting the contribution per @xmath104-plet .",
    "if we estimate @xmath108 mev , we can guess @xmath109 mev , @xmath110 mev , and so on .",
    "this is in accord with detailed few - nucleon calculations using more phenomenological potentials .",
    "the explicit three - body potential at @xmath102 ( from the delta isobar ) and @xmath111 was derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "we can also look at isospin - dependent effects . within the context of @xmath32pt",
    "it can be shown @xcite that isospin is an accidental symmetry , in the sense that it does not appear in the low - energy eft in lowest order , and therefore is typically not an @xmath112 effect , but @xmath113 . in the case of nuclear forces , we find moreover a hierarchy among different types of components .",
    "it is standard to call class i the strongest forces that are isospin symmetric , class ii weaker forces that are isospin violating but charge symmetric , class iii even weaker forces that are charge symmetry breaking but symmetric under permutation of particles in isospin space , and class iv the weakest , remaining forces . in the chiral expansion ,",
    "one indeed finds @xcite that higher class forces appear at higher orders : @xmath114 , where @xmath115 denotes the contribution of the leading class @xmath116 potential .",
    "this qualitatively explains , for example , the observed isospin structure of the two - nucleon coulomb - corrected scattering lengths , @xmath117 .",
    "precise calculations of simultaneous electromagnetic and strong isospin violation in the nuclear potential have also been carried out @xcite .    despite these successful fits and insights ,",
    "the main advantage of the method of eft lies in its concomitant application to many other processes , which might yield more predictive statements .",
    "i now discuss some of these .      before plunging into hard results ,",
    "let me point out another generic result of the chiral expansion . as a result of the factor @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ e : vkolck : nu ] ) , we see immediately in an effect similar to few - nucleon forces that external low - energy probes ( @xmath119 s , @xmath120 s ) will tend to interact predominantly with a single nucleon , simultaneous interactions with more than one nucleon being suppressed by powers of @xmath121 . again , this is a well - known result that arises naturally here .",
    "this is of course what allows extraction , to a certain accuracy , of one - nucleon parameters from nuclear experiments .",
    "more interesting from the nuclear dynamics perspective are , however , those processes where the leading single - nucleon contribution vanishes by a particular choice of experimental conditions , for example the threshold region .",
