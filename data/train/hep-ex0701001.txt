    "hadronic decays of charm mesons are an important tool for understanding the dynamics of the strong interaction in the low energy regime .",
    "hadronic decays of @xmath6 mesons typically have a rich resonant structure and a small nonresonant component .",
    "scalar mesons are abundant products of three - body decays which have a pair of identical pions in the final state . due to these features ,",
    "three - body decays of @xmath6 mesons have been extensively used to study the @xmath7 and @xmath8 systems , with emphasis on the s - wave component of their amplitudes and on the scalar resonances @xcite . with @xmath6",
    "decays one can continuously cover the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mass spectra from threshold up to 1.7 @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , filling the existing gaps between the @xmath11 @xcite and the cern - mnich data @xcite , in the @xmath7 case , and between threshold and 825 @xmath12 , where the lass data @xcite on @xmath8 scattering start .",
    "another interesting feature of @xmath6 decays is that the bulk of the hadronic decay width can be described in terms of simple tree - level quark diagrams .",
    "there seems to be , at least for the vector , axial - vector and tensor mesons , a strong correlation between the final state quarks  the spectator valence quark plus the ones resulting from the weak decay of the @xmath13 quark  and the quark content of the observed resonances in the intermediate states .",
    "this connection allows some insights on the nature of light mesons .",
    "the information provided by @xmath6 decays is , therefore , complementary to that of traditional scattering experiments .",
    "much less information is available concerning the @xmath14/@xmath15 systems and the axial - vector resonances .",
    "the picture emerging from many different dalitz plot analyses of @xmath6 decays reveals a well defined pattern : final states that can be associated with a simple spectator amplitude ( @xmath16-radiation ) , in which the virtual @xmath16 couples to a vector or axial - vector meson , have large branching fractions compared to final states in which the @xmath16 is coupled to a pseudo - scalar meson . following this pattern ,",
    "one expects the @xmath17 channel to be the dominant resonant component of the @xmath18 decay ( charge conjugation is always implied , unless stated otherwise ) .",
    "this decay , therefore , can be used to study the resonant substructure of the axial - vector meson @xmath4 , as well as its line shape , from threshold up to 1.72 @xmath9 .    in the study of light mesons from @xmath6",
    "decays there is one potential difficulty : in hadronic decays the @xmath7 and @xmath8 pairs , as well as the @xmath14/@xmath15 systems , are part of a few - body strongly interacting system . in principle",
    "one must account for final state interactions ( fsi ) between all decay particles .",
    "it is still an open question whether the fsi are strong enough in three - body decays to distort the pure @xmath7/@xmath8 scattering amplitudes . in any case",
    ", the effects of the fsi should become more important as the number of final state particles increases .",
    "most amplitude analyses employ the so called isobar model : a coherent sum of resonant amplitudes weighted by constant complex coefficients .",
    "the constant phases account for re - scattering effects between the isobar and the other decay particles .",
    "this approach to fsi may be sufficient in some cases , but may be too simplistic in four - body decays . in the most general case ,",
    "the fsi would depend on energy , with a smooth variation across the phase space .",
    "a correction to the isobar model would then be necessary in order to incorporate the energy dependent fsi .",
    "as we will show , the energy dependent fsi can probably not be ignored in four - body decays of @xmath6 mesons .",
    "there is an additional motivation for the study of four - body @xmath6 meson decays .",
    "charmless decays of @xmath19 mesons are a promising tool for the study of _ cp _ violation .",
    "in particular , the decays @xmath20 have been used to extract the ckm angle @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 mode , however , also leads to the same @xmath23 final state .",
    "the @xmath24 channel has a branching fraction which is one order of magnitude larger than that of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "there is no measurement of the @xmath26 branching ratio , but since this decay proceeds mainly via the same tree - level @xmath16 radiation amplitude as that of the @xmath27 channel , one expects these two modes to have comparable rates .",
    "the @xmath22 decay , thus , accounts for a large fraction of the @xmath28 decay , and a full amplitude analysis would be necessary in order to isolate the @xmath29 contribution , as in the case of the @xmath18 decay .",
    "all the systematics  form factors , resonance line shapes , representation of the s - wave components , angular distributions , fsi , etc .",
    " are common to both decays .",
    "one can think of the @xmath18 decay as a prototype of the @xmath30 decay .    in this paper , we present a new measurement of the relative branching ratio ( br ) @xmath31 using data from the focus experiment . for the first time",
    "an amplitude analysis has been performed to determine the @xmath18 resonant substructure .",
    "focus , an upgraded version of e687  @xcite , is a charm photo - production experiment which collected data during the 199697 fixed target run at fermilab .",
    "electron and positron beams ( typically with @xmath32 endpoint energy ) obtained from the @xmath33 tevatron proton beam produce , by means of bremsstrahlung , a photon beam which interacts with a segmented beo target  @xcite .",
    "the mean photon energy for reconstructed charm events is @xmath34 .",
    "a system of three multi - cell threshold erenkov counters performs the charged particle identification , separating kaons from pions up to a momentum of @xmath35 .",
    "two systems of silicon micro - vertex detectors are used to track particles : the first system consists of 4 planes of micro - strips interleaved with the experimental target  @xcite and the second system consists of 12 planes of micro - strips located downstream of the target .",
    "these high resolution detectors allow the identification and separation of charm primary ( production ) and secondary ( decay ) vertices .",
    "the charged particle momentum is determined by measuring the deflections in two magnets of opposite polarity through five stations of multi - wire proportional chambers .",
    "the final states are selected using a candidate driven vertex algorithm  @xcite . to minimize systematic errors on the measurements of the branching ratio , we use identical vertex cuts on the signal and normalizing mode .",
    "secondary vertices are formed from the four candidate tracks .",
    "the momentum of the resultant @xmath36 candidate is used as a _",
    "track to intersect other reconstructed tracks and to search for a primary vertex .",
    "the confidence levels of both vertices are required to be greater than 1% .",
    "the mean energy of the @xmath37 candidates in the lab frame is 85gev .",
    "this is equivalent to an average decay length of 1 cm , allowing a good spatial separation between the production and decay vertices .",
    "once the position of the production and decay of the @xmath37 candidate is determined , the distance @xmath38 between the vertices and its uncertainty @xmath39 are computed .",
    "the ratio @xmath40 is the most important variable for separating charm events from non - charm prompt backgrounds .",
    "signal quality is further enhanced by cutting on the isolation variables , _",
    "iso1 _ and _ iso2_. the isolation variable _ iso1 _ requires that the tracks forming the @xmath6 candidate vertex have a confidence level smaller than the cut to form a vertex with the tracks from the primary vertex .",
    "the _ iso2 _",
    "variable requires that all remaining tracks not assigned to the primary and secondary vertex have a confidence level smaller than the cut to form a vertex with the @xmath6 candidate daughters .",
    "in addition , we require the secondary vertex to lie outside of the segmented targets ( _ o_ut-_o_f-_m_aterial cut , or _ oom _ ) , in order to reduce contamination due to secondary interactions .",
    "the _ oom _ variable is actually the the distance between the secondary vertex and the edge of the nearest target segment divided by the uncertainty on the secondary vertex location .",
    "we have also applied a cut on @xmath41 , a variable built from the _ oom _ , @xmath38/@xmath39 and the confidence level of the secondary vertex , in order to explore the correlations between these variables .",
    "each of these variables is normalized to its maximum value , so @xmath41 ranges from 0 to 1 .",
    "this cut allows us to further reduce the background without applying tighter cuts on each of these variables .",
    "the set of cuts that yield the @xmath18 signal with the best statistical significance is @xmath38/@xmath39",
    "@xmath42 @xmath43 , _",
    "iso1 _ and _ iso2 _",
    "@xmath44 10% , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the only difference in the selection criteria between the @xmath18 and @xmath47 decay modes lies in the particle identification cuts .",
    "the erenkov identification cuts used in focus are based on likelihood ratios between the various particle identification hypotheses .",
    "these likelihoods are computed for a given track from the observed firing response ( on or off ) of all the cells that are within the track s ( @xmath48 ) erenkov cone for each of our three erenkov counters .",
    "the product of all firing probabilities for all the cells within the three erenkov cones produces a @xmath49-like variable @xmath50 where @xmath51 ranges over the electron , pion , kaon , and proton hypotheses  @xcite .",
    "the kaon track is required to have @xmath52 , and all pion tracks are required to be separated by less than @xmath53 from the best hypothesis , that is @xmath54 .",
    "using the set of selection cuts just described , we obtain the invariant mass distribution for @xmath55 shown in fig . [ m4pi ] .",
    "although the erenkov cuts considerably reduce the reflection peak ( from @xmath56 ) to the left of the signal peak , there is still a large distortion of the background due to this surviving contamination .",
    "the @xmath55 mass plot is fit with a function that includes two gaussians with the same mean but different sigmas to take into account the variation in momentum resolution of our spectrometer as a function of particle momentum @xcite , and two exponential functions for the combinatorial background and for the @xmath56 reflection .",
    "a log - likelihood fit gives a signal of @xmath57 @xmath18 events , over a background of @xmath58 events .",
    "the large statistics @xmath59 mass plot is also fit with two gaussians with the same mean and different sigmas plus a second - order polynomial for the background .",
    "a log - likelihood fit gives a signal of @xmath60 @xmath61 events .",
    "signal ; the lower plot is the normalizing channel @xmath62 .",
    "the fits ( solid curves ) are explained in the text ; the dashed line shows the background . the hatched area on the @xmath63 signal corresponds to the events used in the amplitude analysis.,width=8 ]",
    "the evaluation of relative branching ratios requires yields from the fits to be corrected for detector acceptance and efficiency .",
    "these differ among the various decay modes , depending on the @xmath64 values and erenkov identification efficiency .    from the monte carlo simulations , we compute the relative efficiencies ( with statistical error only ) :    @xmath65    using the previous results , we obtain the following value for the branching ratio :    @xmath66    systematic uncertainties on the branching ratio measurement may come from different sources .",
    "we estimate the systematic uncertainty on the yields and on the efficiencies considering three independent types of contributions : the _ split sample _ component , the _ fit variant _ component , and the component due to the particular choice of the vertex and erenkov cuts .    the _ split sample _ component takes into account the systematics introduced by a residual difference between data and monte carlo , due to a possible mismatch in the reproduction of the @xmath36 momentum and the changing experimental conditions of the spectrometer during data collection .",
    "this component has been determined by splitting data into four independent subsamples , according to the @xmath36 momentum range ( high and low momentum ) and the configuration of the vertex detector , that is , before and after the insertion of the upstream silicon system . a technique , employed in focus and modeled after the _ s - factor method _ from the particle data group  @xcite ,",
    "was used to try to separate true systematic variations from statistical fluctuations .",
    "the branching ratio is evaluated for each of the four statistically independent subsamples and a _ scaled error _",
    "@xmath67 ( that is the errors are boosted when @xmath68 ) is calculated .",
    "split sample _",
    "error @xmath69 is defined as the difference in quadrature between the statistical error returned by the fit on the unsplit data set , @xmath70 , and the scaled error , if the scaled error exceeds the statistical error , @xmath71 .",
    "another possible source of systematic uncertainty is the _",
    "fit variant_. this component is computed by varying , in a reasonable manner , the fitting conditions for the whole data set . in our study",
    "we fixed the widths of the gaussian to the values obtained by the monte carlo simulation , we changed the background parametrization ( varying the degree of the polynomial ) , and we use one gaussian instead of two .",
    "the latter is the dominant contribution to the _ fit variant _ error .",
    "finally the variation of the computed efficiencies , both for @xmath18 and the normalizing decay mode , due to the different resonant substructure simulated in the monte carlo has been taken into account .",
    "the br values obtained by these variants are all _ a priori _ equally likely , therefore this uncertainty can be estimated by the _ r.m.s . _  of the measurements .",
    "we estimate the cut component systematic error by varying vertex and particle identification cuts one at a time .",
    "we varied the confidence level of the secondary vertex from 1% to 50% , _",
    "iso1 _ and _ iso2 _ from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , @xmath38/@xmath39 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 , @xmath76 from @xmath77 to @xmath78 , and @xmath41 from 0 to 0.2 .",
    "analogously to the _ fit variant _ , the cut component is estimated using the standard deviation of the several sets of cuts .",
    "actually , this is an overestimate of the cut component because the statistics of the cut samples are different .    finally , adding in quadrature the three components , we get the final systematic errors which are summarized in table  [ err_sist ] .    .contributions to the systematic uncertainties of the branching ratio + @xmath31 .",

    "the total @xmath89 is formed by summing over all cells with minimum occupancy .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom is the number of cells with minimum occupancy minus the number of free parameters in the fit .",
    "the baseline model has 9 amplitudes , with 16 free parameters .",
    "there are 166 bins with at least the minimum occupancy , so the number of degrees of freedom is 150 .",
    "these bins include 97% of the data .",
    "the total @xmath89 is 348.0 , which corresponds to a confidence level ( cl ) of @xmath93 .",
    "we conclude from the @xmath89 test that the baseline model does not provide an accurate description of the data in the five - dimensional phase space .",
    "we have looked at the distribution of the @xmath89 throughout the phase space .",
    "that might reveal the need of a missing resonant amplitude , or problems with the representation of the existing amplitudes .",
    "we found that there are 33 bins with @xmath94 , containing approximately 15% of the data events .",
    "the bins that are responsible for the poor confidence level of the fit are evenly distributed throughout the phase space , instead of being concentrated in specific regions . in general ,",

    "no improvement is obtained when other amplitudes of the type @xmath98 are added .",
    "the contribution from @xmath99 is negligible .",
    "this is also the case for amplitudes with higher mass states , like the @xmath100 and the @xmath101 .",
    "it is very unlikely that the poor cl is caused by problems with the representation of the signal amplitudes .",
    "the dominant resonance is the @xmath102 , which has a very well determined line shape . as we will discuss on section vi.e",
    ", the uncertainty in the line shape of the s - wave components does not have a large impact on the fit result .",
    "the other ingredients of the signal amplitudes are the standard angular distributions and the well known , widely used blatt - weisskopf form factors , depending on one single parameter whose value does not significantly affect the fit result .",
    "the isobar model is a very standard tool , and has been successfully used for several decades .",
    "almost all dalitz plot analyses of heavy flavor decays were performed by representing the signal distribution as a coherent sum of resonant amplitudes with constant coefficients .",
    "the isobar model has also been successful in describing four - body decays in the past @xcite ( although no cl was quoted in these analyses ) and recently @xcite , but in all cases the data samples have limited statistics .",
    "this analysis is the first attempt to use the isobar model for an amplitude analysis of a four - body decay with moderately high statistics",
    ". the underlying picture of the isobar model may be too simplistic , signaling other types of effects should be taken into account .",
    "the dominant contribution to the @xmath103 decay comes from the @xmath104 mode , accounting for 60% of the decay rate .",
    "the second most dominant contribution is the @xmath105 mode , with a decay fraction of 25% .",
    "modes of the type @xmath98 correspond to 20% of the decay rate .",
    "the large value of the @xmath104 decay fraction supports the picture of an external @xmath16-radiation amplitude , with the virtual @xmath16 coupling to the @xmath4 , as the dominant mechanism for the @xmath55 final state .",
    "the same dominance has also been observed in other four - body decays , such as @xmath56 and @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "the same picture can be drawn in the case of three - body decays with the @xmath16 coupling to the @xmath107 , such as @xmath108 @xcite or @xmath109 @xcite , where the contribution from @xmath110 exceeds 50% .",
    "this pattern is similar to the well known vector - dominance in electromagnetic interactions .",
    "it can be understood as a manifestation of the v - a nature of the weak interaction .",
    "the relatively large contribution ( 25% ) of the @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) decay has also been seen in other final states , such as @xmath56 , where the mode @xmath113 accounts for 17% of the decay rate , according to @xcite or over 40% , according to @xcite . in the case of the final state",

    ", the internal @xmath16-radiation should be the dominant amplitude .",
    "for any possible meson @xmath117 there are several ways to form a @xmath118 state with @xmath119 , combining the orbital angular momentum between the two pions from the nonresonant @xmath88 system , the orbital angular momentum between this system and the resonance @xmath117 , and the spin of the resonance .",
    "consequently , for any possible resonance @xmath117 we can assign different spin amplitudes .",
    "we tried all possible assignments for the @xmath120 and for the @xmath100 spin amplitudes , but none yielded a significant contribution .",
    "it is interesting to note that the only @xmath98 modes with a significant contribution are @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , with the nonresonant @xmath88 pair being in a pseudoscalar state .",
    "the @xmath88 pair and the resonance must then be in a state of even relative orbital angular momentum , and the resulting spin amplitudes coincide with the ones from three - body @xmath6 decays @xcite .",

    "the three independent helicity amplitudes , corresponding to each of the possible helicity states are @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 .",
    "alternatively , one can decompose the @xmath177 decay amplitude in the so - called transversity basis @xcite , with amplitudes given by @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "this basis represents states in which the vector mesons are longitudinally polarized ( @xmath181 ) , or transversely polarized ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 ) .",
    "the transversity basis states are parity eigenstates .    in the @xmath6 rest frame",
    "the two vector mesons are back - to - back . after a boost along the line - of - flight to the @xmath184 rest frame",
    ", we define the helicity angle @xmath185 as the angle between the @xmath186 and the direction of the boost , measured counterclockwise .",
    "the helicity angle @xmath187 is defined in a similar way . with these definitions and",
    "the acoplanarity angle , @xmath188 , defined as the angle between the @xmath184 , @xmath189 decay planes measured in the @xmath6 frame , one can write the @xmath190 decay amplitude as    @xmath191    in the above equation the amplitudes @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 are of the form @xmath192 , where @xmath193 and @xmath194 are real constants and @xmath195 has all the energy dependent terms : breit - wigner functions , form factors , and the energy dependent part of the angular distribution .",
    "the longitudinal polarization is defined as the ratio of the longitudinal to the total decay rate ,    @xmath196    using the values obtained by the fit ( table [ fractions ] ) we measured @xmath197 .",
    "our value is in agreement with the babar result from @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath198 , but is somewhat different from the polarization measured in @xmath199 ( @xmath200 ) @xcite and in @xmath201 ( @xmath202 @xcite and @xmath203 ) @xcite .",
    "the polarization measured in @xmath19 decays is in agreement with theoretical expectations @xcite , which are based on the assumption that the transition amplitude for the @xmath20 can be written as a product of two independent hadronic currents .",
    "the factorization hypothesis may be a good approximation for @xmath19 meson decays , due to the large value of its mass , but fails to describe hadronic decays of @xmath6 mesons .",
    "that could explain the observed difference in the values of the longitudinal polarization fraction from @xmath6 and @xmath19 decays .",
    "the representation of the structures present in @xmath55 is a major source of systematic uncertainty .",
    "the problem starts with the choice of a set of amplitudes to describe the data .",
    "furthermore , our model depends on some input parameters , which are fixed during the fit : the parameter @xmath204 for the form factors ; the @xmath124 parameters @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath205 ; the relative amount of the backgrounds .",
    "in addition , there are the parameters defining the @xmath206 and the @xmath207 line shape : @xmath208 and @xmath209 , and @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 .",
    "we should also mention that there is some freedom in the choice of the angular distributions .",
    "we investigated the effect of the uncertainty on the input parameters of our model on the fractions and phases for the various intermediate channels .",
    "for this purpose , the data was fit with variations of our baseline model .",
    "we varied the value of @xmath204 from 1 to 5 @xmath213 .",
    "we have also fit the data using different sets of @xmath124 parameters , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath205 . for the @xmath206 and @xmath207",
    "line shapes we used the bes parameterization @xcite .",
    "in addition , we varied the background parameterization : the relative amount of background , the background composition , adding a possible contribution from uncorrelated @xmath87 events , and the relative fractions of the backgrounds , changing the fraction of @xmath214 from 0 to 50% .",
    "a very small change of the values of the fit parameters , compared to their central values , is observed when we vary the @xmath204 parameter , the background parameterization and the @xmath207 line shape .",
    "the systematic errors are largely dominated by the uncertainty in the @xmath124 parameters and on the @xmath206 line shape , in this order .",
    "the total systematic errors are taken as the root mean square of fit variations .",
    "these are propagated to fractions , the longitudinal polarization measurement , and the d / s ratio .",
    "the systematic errors are quoted in table [ fractions ] .",
    "in this paper we presented a new measurement of the relative branching ratio @xmath1 , based on a very clean sample of 6360@xmath215115 events .",
    "our value is compatible with the recent cleo - c result @xcite , which has a sample of comparable size , but with a higher background level .",
    "a full , coherent amplitude analysis of the @xmath18 decay was made for the first time .",
    "the isobar model with nine resonant amplitudes provides a description of the general features of the data . in our model",
    "there are contributions of three types .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the decay @xmath104 , accounting for 60% of the total decay rate .",
    "this is followed the decay @xmath3 , whose relative fraction amounts to 25% , and by the three - body nonresonant decays @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , with a combined fraction of 20% .    the @xmath18 decay is a very suitable tool for investigation of the @xmath4 meson . a good description of this state is achieved assuming a simple resonant substructure , with only three contributions : a dominant @xmath125 s - wave , a small @xmath125 d - wave , and the @xmath219 . in the framework of the flux - tube - breaking model , we measure the @xmath125 d / s ratio to be @xmath220 .",
    "the line shape of the @xmath4 is also an output of the amplitude analysis .",
    "the best description of our data is achieved with the @xmath4 breit - wigner parameters , @xmath157 and @xmath144 , in the range @xmath147 and @xmath221 , with optimum values at @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "the @xmath18 decay has an important @xmath87 component . the helicity formalism is used to to describe the angular distribution of the four pions from this mode . using the transversity basis states and a full amplitude analysis",
    ", we measure the ratio of the longitudinal polarization to the total @xmath111 rate to be @xmath222% .",
    "the fit quality , from an inspection of the five - dimensional phase space , is poor and it is not improved by changing the representation of individual signal amplitudes or by adding other amplitudes to the baseline model . we conclude that in the case of @xmath18 the failure of the isobar model in providing an accurate description of our data suggests that other type of effects should be taken into account .",
    "possible candidates are the bose - einstein correlations or a non - uniform nonresonant amplitude",
    ". the most crucial missing ingredient may be the energy dependent final state interactions .",
    "unfortunately this is a very difficult problem , even for three - body decays . to our knowledge , there are no calculations of the effects of fsi in four - body decays .",
    "this problem , however , must be addressed in order to explore the full potential of the hadronic decays of heavy flavor and the amplitude analysis technique .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the assistance of the staffs of fermi national accelerator laboratory , the infn of italy , and the physics departments of the collaborating institutions .",
    "this research was supported in part by the u.  s. national science foundation , the u.  s. department of energy , the italian istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare and ministero della istruzione universit e ricerca , the brazilian conselho nacional de desenvolvimento cientfico e tecnolgico , conacyt - mxico , and the korea research foundation of the korean ministry of education .",
    "the angular distributions of the final state particles result from angular momentum conservation throughout the whole decay chain .",
    "these distributions depend on both the spin of the intermediate resonances and on the orbital angular momentum at each vertex . in the case of sequential decays , like",
    "the @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 chain , parity conservation is also a constraint on the @xmath124 decay and all its subsequent decay products .",
    "amplitudes describing angular distributions , hereafter called spin amplitudes for short , are , in general defined using the relativistic tensor formalism @xcite .",
    "this formalism explores the connection between the only available observables  the momenta of the final state particles  and the spin / orbital angular momentum dynamics .",
    "polarization vectors , representing the spin / orbital angular momentum involved at each vertex , as well as all relevant 4-momenta , are written in terms of these final state momenta .",
    "covariance , invariance under rotations and parity conservation , whenever applicable , restricts the many possible combinations between 4-momenta and polarization vectors .        in our model for the @xmath124 resonant substructure",
    "there are three amplitudes : @xmath227 , with the @xmath228 and the @xmath229 in relative s- and d - wave ; and the @xmath126 .",
    "we denote the @xmath124 and @xmath228 polarization 4-vectors with helicity @xmath230 by @xmath231 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "we form lorentz scalars at each step of the decay sequence by contracting these polarization vectors with the appropriate 4-momenta . in a step where the resonance appears as a decay product , the complex conjugate of its polarization 4-vector",
    "if the @xmath124 is formed by particles 1 , 2 and 3 , then the amplitude for the @xmath233 is                        we then combine the amplitudes for each step and must sum over the @xmath124 and @xmath228 polarizations , since none of these states is observed directly .",
    "the sum over polarizations is simplified by using the completeness relation @xcite                    the spin amplitudes for the @xmath111 decay are written in the helicity formalism .",
    "this decay is of the type @xmath251 , where @xmath252 are the vector meson helicities .",
    "given that the initial state has @xmath253 , the constraint @xmath254 implies that @xmath255 .",
    "the only allowed values for the vector meson helicity are @xmath256 , @xmath257 , and @xmath258 .",
    "the helicity - basis states @xmath259 are @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 .    for each helicity state",
    "there is one independent amplitude .",
    "these amplitudes are functions of the helicity angles , defined in each resonance rest frame , and of the angle formed by the vector mesons decay planes ( acoplanarity angle ) , measured in the @xmath6 rest frame .",
    "we define the @xmath263 axis along the line of flight of the vector mesons in the @xmath6 rest frame . with the notation @xmath264 and @xmath265 , the helicity angles @xmath185 and @xmath187 are defined as the angle between @xmath266 and the @xmath263 axis , in the @xmath267 rest frame , and the angle between @xmath268 and the @xmath263 axis , in the @xmath269 rest frame .",
    "the above amplitudes are expressed in terms of non - covariant quantities , defined in different reference frames .",
    "covariance is recovered by multiplying the helicity amplitudes by an energy dependent term , which accounts for the boosts from each resonance frame to the @xmath6 frame .",
    "each of the above amplitudes is then multiplied by              e.m .",
