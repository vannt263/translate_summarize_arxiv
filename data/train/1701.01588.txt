    "cvso  30b ( ptfo  8 - 8695b ) is a candidate transiting hot jupiter around a weak - line t tauri star in the orion ob1a/25-ori region found by @xcite . the age of cvso  30 is estimated as @xmath3 myr @xcite making this object the youngest candidate planet .",
    "the host star is an m3 type pre - main - sequence star in the orion ob1a region at a distance of @xmath4 pc .",
    "cvso  30 has the mass of @xmath5 ( using the @xcite model ) or @xmath6 ( using the @xcite model ) , the radius of @xmath7 , and the effective temperature of 3470 k @xcite .",
    "the candidate planet has the orbital period of @xmath8 days which is comparable to the rotational period of the host star , the mass of @xmath9 , the radius of @xmath10 , and the orbital semi - major axis of @xmath11 au @xcite .",
    "in contrast to other planetary transiting objects , the observed fading light curves of cvso  30 change with the observational epoch .",
    "@xcite explained them in the combination of the precession of planetary orbit s ascending node and the stellar gravity darkening effect assuming synchronization of the stellar rotation and the planetary orbital motion .",
    "@xcite added the photometric data and reanalyzed the light curves using the precession and the gravity - darkening model without the co - rotation .    on the other hand",
    ", @xcite observed a primary transit at @xmath12 using spitzer irac without any sign of a secondary eclipse .",
    "in addition , their radial velocity measurement showed no evidence of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect .",
    "@xcite observed 13 events with @xmath13-band and other 13 events with @xmath14-band over three years .",
    "they found that the fading period is not constant .",
    "multiband simultaneous observations were done for five fading events , of which @xmath15- and @xmath14-bands observed simultaneously on two other nights , @xmath13- and @xmath16-bands observed on another two nights , and @xmath14- and @xmath17-bands observed on one night .",
    "their multiband observations yielded that the depth of all but one fading events was deeper at short wavelengths ; one of the fading events in the @xmath15- and @xmath14-bands showed the same depth . additionally , they tried to detect the secondary eclipse at infrared and the rossiter - mclaughlin effect by high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "however , they were unable to find the expected signature in both observations but found strong variable h@xmath18 and ca h & k lines .",
    "hence @xcite argued that the transit - like events were unlikely to be caused by a giant planet but rather caused by either starspots near the rotational pole , circumstellar dust clump transit or occultation of an accretion hotspot .",
    "@xcite observed 33 fading events and found that the period of the fading event was shortened .",
    "they also observed a fading event in the @xmath19- and the @xmath20-bands simultaneously , and found that the light curve showed the same depth .",
    "@xcite observed excess h@xmath18 emission of cvso  30 .",
    "the excess h@xmath18 emission was not detected constantly .",
    "however , the observed velocity motion in transit was almost expected .",
    "they argued that this excess came from the planet in the middle of mass loss .    as presented above , the true nature of cvso  30b",
    "is still unclear , and both planet and non - planet scenarios have been argued .",
    "thus further observational findings are still important to reveal the identity of cvso  30b .",
    "we focus on that in the previous studies both the presence and absence of the wavelength dependence in the depth of fading events have been reported @xcite .",
    "we here report our results of independent three - band simultaneous transit photometry for a fading event of cvso  30 .",
    "the simultaneity is important because cvso  30 has a large stellar variability and its fading shape is changing with time .",
    "we use the multicolor simultaneous camera for studying atmospheres of transiting exoplanets ( muscat ) @xcite on the 188 cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) to investigate the wavelength dependence of a fading event .",
    "we describe the observations and the analysis method in sections  [ sec : observation ] and [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "section  [ sec : result ] shows the observed light curves , the results of transit fitting and wavelength dependence . in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the origin of transit - like events .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and future plans in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we observed a fading event of cvso  30 on 2016 feb . 9 ( ut ) .",
    "we used the muscat on the 188-cm telescope at oao .",
    "muscat can simultaneously take three - band images using two dichroic mirrors and the sdss @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band filters .",
    "muscat equips three @xmath21 pixels ccds with the field of view of @xmath22 .    to achieve the high precision photometry , we did not dither but fixed the target position on the detector , and defocused the stellar psf .",
    "the exposure times were 60 seconds for all the bands .",
    "we obtained 238 , 236 , and 236 frames for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands , respectively , in 4.4 hours .",
    "data reduction and aperture photometry were processed using the customized pipeline by @xcite .",
    "our analysis method is similar to that used by @xcite .",
    "first , we make light curves using different combinations of comparison stars and various aperture radii .",
    "we choose the comparison stars which are not saturated nor variable stars and the aperture radius which produces a light curve with minimum dispersion outside the fading event .",
    "the selected aperture radii are 17 , 14 , and 12 pixels for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands , respectively , and the comparison stars are the same two stars for each band .",
    "second , we convert the time system of modified julian day ( mjd ) in universal time coordinate ( utc ) which is recorded in the fits headers into barycentric julian day ( bjd ) in barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) using the algorithm of @xcite . we also remove outliers that separate beyond @xmath23 from mean relative flux of each band . as a result , we use 172 , 221 , and 220 data for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands , respectively . the produced light curves are shown in the top panels in figure [ fig : lc_obs ] .",
    "next , we fit the light curves with a transit model , assuming that the fading event is caused by a transiting spherical body .",
    "we use the transit light curve model by @xcite which is comparable to the quadratic limb - darkening law case of @xcite .",
    "the transit modeling parameters are the time of the transit center @xmath24 , the ratio of the planet to the stellar radius @xmath25 , the ratio of the semimajor axis to the stellar radius @xmath26 , and the impact parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the variations seen outside the fading event seem to be caused by the variability of cvso  30 itself or comparison stars , with changing of airmass , shifting of stellar images on the detector and so on .",
    "we fit the transit light curves and baseline model at the same time using the customized code by @xcite which is based on @xcite and @xcite . a transit and out - of - transit ( oot ) model",
    "is expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the relative flux , @xmath30 is the transit light curve model , \\{*x * } are time - dependent observed variables for example airmass , shifts of stellar position on the ccd and so on , \\{*k * } are coefficients @xcite .",
    "we fix the orbital eccentricity to zero and the limb - darkening parameters to the values from @xcite , @xmath31 for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands .",
    "in addition , we put a gaussian prior for @xmath32 , based on the value of @xcite .    for choosing the most appropriate combination of free parameters ,",
    "we optimize the parameters using the amoeba algorithm @xcite and evaluate the bayesian information criteria ( bic : @xcite ) .",
    "the bic value is defined by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number of free parameters , and @xmath35 is the number of data points .",
    "we calculate the bic values for each light curve and parameter , then we pick out the combinations to the minimum bic value for each band . for \\{*x * } , we test different combinations of the time @xmath36 , the square of time @xmath37 , the airmass @xmath38 , and the relative stellar positions on the ccd @xmath39 . based on minimum bic , we adopt @xmath40 , @xmath41 for all bands .    to take into account the time - correlated noise ( so - called red noise ; e.g. @xcite ) , we multiply each flux uncertainty by the red - noise factor @xmath42 which is the ratio of the observed standard deviation of the binned light curve to the expected standard deviation of the unbinned and non - time - correlated light curve .",
    "the binning sizes are between 5 and 20 minutes .",
    "we obtain the median of @xmath42 for each binning size and multiply the median @xmath42 by the uncertainty of each data .",
    "the typical photometric errors including @xmath42 are 2.1% , 0.87% , 0.54% for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands , respectively .",
    "after that , to estimate the uncertainty of the free parameters , we analyze the chosen light curve by the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method following @xcite and @xcite . we first analyze independently the light curves for each band , and after that we jointly analyze all the light curves .",
    "we make the mcmc chain with @xmath43 steps and first @xmath44 steps are excluded as burn - in .",
    "we define 1@xmath45 uncertainties as the range of the parameters between 15.87% and 84.13% of the merged posterior distributions .",
    "table [ tab : param ] shows the best - fit transit parameters and uncertainties obtained by the mcmc analysis .",
    "note that we obtain consistent results when we fit the light curves that are produced by different baseline models with comparable bic values .",
    "we show the transit light curves and the best - fit models of each observation in figure [ fig : lc_obs ] .    [",
    "tab : param ]        [ tab : impact ]    @xcite and @xcite reported that the fading depth of cvso  30 changes with the observational epoch . according to @xcite ,",
    "the loss of light was 20 - 30% larger in the bluer band on 2012 dec .",
    "14 at @xmath15- and @xmath46-band , on 2014 jan . 9 and 2014",
    "18 at @xmath13- and @xmath16-band , and on 2014 jan . 19 at @xmath46- and @xmath17-band respectively .",
    "however , the loss of light in @xmath15 was essentially the same as in @xmath46 on 2012 dec . 15 .",
    "we present the fading depth in @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands observed simultaneously .",
    "figure [ fig : rprs_comp ] gives the wavelength dependence of @xmath25 .",
    "the top panel shows the best - fit parameters for @xmath25 and their uncertainties for each band in table [ tab : param ] .",
    "the uncertainties are strongly influenced by the impact parameter @xmath27 which is grazing .",
    "we recalculate the @xmath25 and their uncertainties fixing the impact parameter at the median and 1 @xmath45 upper / lower limit @xmath47 in order to highlight the wavelength dependence of @xmath25 ( figure [ fig : rprs_comp ] : bottom panel ; table [ tab : impact ] ) . as the result , we find that the clear wavelength dependence in @xmath25 is apparent regardless of the value of @xmath27 .     in @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band from table [ tab : param ] .",
    "bottom panel : the wavelength dependence of @xmath25 at the impact parameter fixed by @xmath48,width=302 ]",
    "each of cvso  30 s fading light curve shapes varies in the observational epoch , with some showing large fading and others showing small fading @xcite .",
    "therefore , multicolor simultaneous observations are necessary to discuss wavelength dependence of light curves .",
    "the previous multicolor observations are performed in two bands @xcite . in order to reveal precise wavelength dependence",
    ", we observe in three bands simultaneously .",
    "the apparent @xmath25 is larger at shorter wavelengths , 40 - 90% larger for @xmath49 , and 20 - 50% larger for @xmath50 .",
    "now , we consider whether the cloudless atmosphere can explain this wavelength dependence .",
    "the atmospheric scaleheight @xmath17 is written as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath53 is the atmospheric temperature , @xmath54 is the mean molecular weight which is @xmath55 for h / he - dominated atmosphere ( e.g. @xcite ) , and @xmath56 is the local gravity .",
    "we assume that the planet candidate equilibrium temperature of 1800 k , the planetary mass of 0.9 @xmath57 from upper limit of @xcite , the planetary radius of 2.8 @xmath58 from @xmath25 of this work and stellar radius of 1.39 @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "then , the calculated scale height @xmath17 is 2300 km or 0.0023 @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the variation between the @xmath61- and the @xmath2-band corresponds to 30@xmath17 and that between the @xmath62- and the @xmath2-band is 60@xmath17 . in comparison ,",
    "the variation of hd  189733b from ( , fig .",
    "14 ) , the radius variation of hd  189733b between 630 nm and 880 nm corresponding to the @xmath61- and the @xmath2-band is 1.5 @xmath17 , between 490 nm and 880 nm corresponding to the @xmath62- and the @xmath2-band is 2.5 @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , we compare the wavelength dependence with cloudless rayleigh scattering following @xcite .",
    "the slope of the planetary radius depending on wavelength as a function is expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath18 is a power - low coefficient ( @xmath64 for rayleigh scattering ) , and @xmath65 is wavelength .",
    "the corresponding differential radius is 63000 km for the @xmath61-band vs the @xmath2-band and 130000 km for the @xmath62-band vs the @xmath2-band .",
    "this result yields that @xmath18 is -80 to -100 .",
    "therefore , the wavelength dependence of the cvso  30 s fading event is too large to be explained by the atmospheric rayleigh scattering of a gas giant planet .",
    "we also discuss the influence of gravity darkening @xcite . @xcite and @xcite explained the changes of the shape of transit light curve with gravity darkening .",
    "the intensity distribution on the gravity - darkened star varies with observing wavelengths , and therefore the transit light curves have wavelength dependence @xcite .",
    "now , we test whether the wavelength dependence is explainable in terms of gravity - darkening effect .",
    "we calculate the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band model light curve with gravity darkening in the condition that the largest wavelength dependence is expected .",
    "the derivation of the intensity distribution is obtained by numerical integration with the formula by @xcite .",
    "we assume the strongest gravity darkening case , the stellar obliquity @xmath66 pole - on orbit , the impact parameter @xmath67 , @xmath68 to approximate the observed fading depth in the @xmath1-band .",
    "we also fix @xmath26 with the best - fit parameter in table [ tab : param ] , limb darkening parameter with the same value in section [ sec : analysis ] , the stellar rotational velocity with @xmath69 km / s obtained by the stellar radius and the rotational period in @xcite .",
    "the derived gravity - darkened model light curve is shown in figure [ fig : gravdark ] . the transit depths with gravity darkening",
    "are 2.0% , 1.9% , 1.6% for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands , respectively ( table [ tab : gravdark ] ) .",
    "the wavelength dependence caused by gravity darkening is weak and not able to reproduce the observed depths of 3.1% , 1.7% , 1.0% for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-band , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the observed wavelength dependence of the fading depths is too large and can not be explained by the gravity - darkening effect alone .",
    "[ tab : gravdark ]    the candidate origins of the fading events except a gas giant proposed by @xcite are starspots near the rotational pole , and orbiting or accreting dust . according to @xcite ,",
    "weak - line t - tauri stars have stable long - term periodic variability for several years by starspots and stellar rotation .",
    "such long - term stability is , however , the result of starspot modulation on so - called active longitudes despite shorter lifetime ( weeks ) of each starspot .",
    "cvso  30 has been observed to display transit - like fading events over six years since the first observations by @xcite .",
    "the starspots as a cause of fading events are unlikely because it is difficult for the spots to exist near the pole at all times .    the remaining possibility for the wavelength dependence would be in favor of a transiting dust clump .",
    "as an example of dust with a rocky planet , @xcite found that the shape of transit light curves of kic  12557548 changes in time . in another example of a disintegrating planet ,",
    "@xcite signified the wavelength difference of the transit depth by spectro - photometric observation in k2 - 22b .",
    "the exponent of the our extinction power law which is defined as @xmath70 , where a is fading depth obtained by @xmath71 , is @xmath72 .",
    "this value is similar to the exponent of the extinction by interstellar medium @xmath73 obtained by @xcite .",
    "the candidate sources of dust include a disintegrating rocky planet , a circumstellar disk , and an occultation of accretion hotspot .",
    "we have observed the transit - like fading event of the weak - line t - tauri star cvso  30 in the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands simultaneously for the first time , using the muscat instrument on the 188 cm telescope at okayama astrophysical observatory .",
    "we perform the light curves fitting using transit model with the independent @xmath25 , the same @xmath26 , and the same impact parameter for each band .",
    "we have detected significant wavelength dependence in cvso  30 s fading light curve .",
    "the result of transit light curve fitting shows the large wavelength dependence in transit depths of 3.1% , 1.8% , 1.1% for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- , and @xmath2-bands , respectively .",
    "the wavelength dependence rules out a transiting gas giant scenario because of being too large to be due to a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere of a hot jupiter or the gravity - darkening effect .",
    "in addition , the starspots as a cause of fading events are unlikely because it is difficult for the spots to exist several years near the pole at all times .",
    "thus our result is in favor of transit by circumstellar dust clump or occultation of an accretion hotspot which were introduced by @xcite .",
