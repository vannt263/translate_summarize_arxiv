    "the compositions of the atmospheres of white dwarfs are observed to be dominated by the lightest elements , h ( das ) or he ( do / dbs ) , as predicted several decades ago by theory ( schatzman 1958 ) . unimpeded , the high surface gravities of these objects cause heavier elements to settle out on timescales of mere days ( e.g. dupuis et al . 1993 ) .",
    "nevertheless , ultraviolet observations have revealed trace quantities of metals in the photospheres of a large number of hot white dwarfs ( t@xmath3k ) , e.g. c , fe and ni in g191-b2b ( bruhweiler & kondo 1983 , vennes et al .",
    "1992 , holberg et al . 1994 ) and a handful of cooler degenerates e.g. si in wolf 1346 ( t@xmath4k ; holberg et al .",
    "furthermore , high resolution optical spectroscopic observations have shown that @xmath520% of das cooler than 10000k are daz stars , that is they contain observable quantities of ca , mg , and fe ( zuckerman et al .",
    "clearly , there are processes operating in the photospheres of these objects which can compete against gravitational settling .",
    "several theoretical studies have shown that the transfer of net upward momentum from the intense radiation field to heavy elements via their bound - bound transitions can prevent small but detectable quantities of metals from sinking out of the photospheres of white dwarfs with t@xmath6@xmath720000k(e.g .",
    "vauclair , vauclair & greenstein 1979 ) .",
    "a number of these investigations have made relatively precise predictions regarding the abundances of heavy elements as a function of surface gravity and effective temperature ( e.g chayer et al .",
    "1995a , schuh 2005 ) . indeed , these calculations are able to qualitatively reproduce some of the more general trends , affirming radiative levitation as an influential mechanism in preventing gravitational settling in the atmospheres of these hotter stars .",
    "for example , they successfully replicate the observed sharp decline in the abundance of fe at t@xmath6@xmath850000k and the observed decrease with t@xmath6 in the overall metal content of white dwarf photospheres .",
    "further , in accord with these calculations the abundances of elements such as c and n appear to be largely independent of effective temperature at t@xmath6@xmath950000k ( see barstow et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "however , at a more quantitative level , there are significant discrepancies between observed heavy element abundances and the predictions of equilibrium radiative levitation theory . on theoretical grounds , stars with comparable effective temperatures and surface gravities",
    "are expected to have similar photospheric abundances , but in reality can show radically different compositions .",
    "for example , while the observed energy distribution of gd153 is consistent with that of a pure - h atmosphere , gd394 and re1614 - 085 contain significant quantities of silicon ( [ si / h]=-5.1@xmath100.1 ) and nitrogen ( [ n / h]=-3.6@xmath100.1 ) respectively , despite all three objects having t@xmath6@xmath838000k and log g@xmath87.8 ( holberg et al .",
    "it has often been argued that these anomalies indicate other processes ( e.g. accretion or massloss ) , act in conjunction with radiative levitation , at least in some stars , to dictate photospheric composition .",
    "our survey of the abundances of c , n , o , si , fe and ni in the photospheres of 25 hot da white dwarfs is the most comprehensive undertaken to date and unearthed a number of interesting results ( see barstow et al .",
    "however , it was based largely on hst stis data , a sample that can not now be enlarged due to instrument failure . to gain a more complete understanding of the relative influence of each of these physical processes it is important to continue enlarging the sample of stars for which robust measurements and limits on the abundances of photospheric metals are available .",
    "further , it is particularly important to increase the number of such stars in effective temperature ranges where few objects have previously been studied ( e.g. 20000k@xmath11t@xmath6@xmath1140000k ) . over the last few years",
    "the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) has observed a large number of white dwarfs . this has led to the provision of a collection of homogeneous spectroscopic data covering @xmath12@xmath8900 - 1200 with generally moderate to good signal - to - noise , for @xmath7100 das .",
    "much of this data is now in the public domain and available for download from the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) .",
    "these fuse observations offer the benefit over iue and hst data of access to resonance lines of p and s. thus photospheric abundance surveys can now be expanded to include these two additional elements .",
    "gd71 ( wd0459 + 158 ) , first catalogued by giclas et al .",
    "( 1965 ) , is a bright nearby hot da white dwarf lying virtually in the middle of the aforementioned temperature range ( t@xmath6@xmath832000k ) .",
    "it has been studied extensively at optical , uv , euv and near - ir wavelengths and is widely used as a photometric and spectrophotometric calibration star ( e.g. landolt 1992 , bohlin et al .",
    "2001 ) . within their respective statistical uncertainties , the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) and extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) spectra of gd71",
    "are entirely consistent with a pure - h atmosphere and to date no heavy elements have been detected in its photosphere ( barstow et al .",
    "1997 , holberg et al .",
    "1998 ) . indeed , for spectrophotometric calibration purposes it has been assumed to have a pure - h composition ( e.g. bohlin 1996 ) .",
    "however , we have chosen to examine this assumption more closely , since 1 ) radiative levitation theory predicts the presence of small but nevertheless detectable quantities of photospheric metals down to t@xmath6@xmath820000k ( e.g. si , al and p ) , 2 ) to date only a handful of objects have been studied in detail in the range 20000k@xmath11t@xmath6@xmath1140000k and 3 ) there exists a fuse spectrum with good s / n ( @xmath530 ) for this white dwarf .",
    ".the log of the fuse observation of gd71 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      a closer inspection of the coadded fuse spectrum has also revealed several weak features arising from species of relatively high ionization states e.g. the resonance lines of pv at 1117.977  and 1128.008 .",
    "the velocities of these transitions are identical within the measurement uncertainties so they probably have a common origin ( see table 2 ) .",
    "although these lines are coincident in velocity space with a number of features attributable to the ism , residual uncertainties in the wavelength calibration of this dataset and the similarity between the velocities of the ism along this line of sight and the atmosphere of gd71 , as discussed above , mean that an interstellar , circumstellar or photospheric origin can not be ruled out at this stage .",
    "nevertheless , other considerations indicate the former interpretation is unlikely .",
    "for example , the ionization stages of the progenitor ions are higher than those typically found in the ism .",
    "the piii 1003.600  line arises from the 2p@xmath13 - 2s multiplet and has a lower level 0.07ev above the ground state .",
    "furthermore , in a solar mixture p is less abundant by a factor 1000 than c , n or o.    to examine the two other possible origins in more detail , we have acquired from mast the fuse data products for two further white dwarfs with similar effective temperatures and surface gravities to gd71 .",

    "the weighted mean velocities of these interstellar and photospheric lines in the spectrum of re j1918 + 595 are + 23.5@xmath100.3kms@xmath14 and + 59.8@xmath100.9kms@xmath14 respectively . in the spectrum of re j0605 - 482",

    "a previous high resolution uv study has revealed circumstellar features along the lines of sight to nine out of a sample of 23 hot da white dwarfs ( bannister et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the vast majority of these 9 cases",
    "the difference in the velocities of the circumstellar and interstellar features was found to be less than 10kms@xmath14 .",
    "the difference in velocity between the pv transitions and the ism lines in the fuse spectra of re j1918 + 595 and re j0605 - 482 are 31.8@xmath101.5kms@xmath14 and 35.5@xmath103.0 kms@xmath14 respectively , arguing against a circumstellar origin . indeed , given the scatter typically seen in our measurements , the velocities of the pv lines strongly support a photospheric interpretation . in figure 1",
    "we show sections of the fuse spectra of gd71 , re j1918 + 595 and re j0605 - 482 centered on the pv resonance transitions . for the purposes of this plot",
    "we have applied a shift to the wavelength scales to co - align the 1117.977  line in the three datasets .",
    "on the weight of the above evidence , we conclude that the most likely origin of the high ionization p lines identified in the fuse spectrum of gd71 is the stellar photosphere . accepting this",
    ", we now use model atmosphere calculations to place constraints on the abundance of photospheric phosphorus in these three das .",
    "the models utilised in this work have been generated with the latest versions of the plane - parallel , hydrostatic , non - lte atmosphere and spectral synthesis codes tlusty ( v200 ; hubeny 1988 , hubeny & lanz 1995 , hubeny & lanz private comm . ) and synspec ( v48 ; hubeny et al .",
    "we have employed state - of - the - art model ions of h and p. the hi ion incorporates the 8 lowest energy levels and one superlevel extending from n=9 to n=80 , where the dissolution of the high lying levels was treated by means of the occupation probability formalism of hummer & mihalas ( 1988 ) , generalised to the non - lte situation by hubeny , hummer & lanz ( 1994 ) .",
    "the piv and pv model ions were developed by lanz & hubeny ( 2003 ) for the study of o - stars and full details may be found therein .",
    "the piii ion , which incorporates the 9 lowest levels , was constructed in a similar manner , except the online version of autostructure was used to estimate oscillator strengths where experimental values were unavailable .",
    "all calculations were carried out under the assumption of radiative equilibrium and incorporated a full treatment of line blanketing effects . during the calculation of the model structure",
    "the lines of the lyman and balmer series were treated by means of an approximate stark profile but in the spectral synthesis step , detailed profiles for the lyman lines were calculated from the stark broadening tables of lemke ( 1997 ) .",
    "numerous estimates of the effective temperature and surface gravity of gd71 are available in the literature e.g. marsh et al .",

    "hence we generated a grid of h+p models spanning the ranges t@xmath6=30000 - 35000(2500)k , log g=7.5 - 8.5(0.5 ) and [ p / h]=-12  -7.0(1.0 ) .",
    "our general spectral analysis techniques have been described at length in previous publications .",

    "only the regions of the co - added , optimal s / n , dataset which include the lyman lines and the locations of the phosphorus transitions predicted to be most prominent in this effective temperature and surface gravity range were incorporated into the spectral fitting process ( e.g. 930 - 990 , 1000 - 1050 1116 - 1120  and 1126 - 1130 ) . during the analysis ,",
    "each of these sections was assigned an independent normalisation parameter to circumvent any residual errors in the shape of the continuum flux .",
    "all errors quoted here are @xmath15 unless stated otherwise but as these are derived formally from the fitting process , they may underestimate the true uncertainties .",
    "the parameters of our best fitting homogeneous model representations of the fuse spectra of all three white dwarfs are given in table 3 .",
    "we note that the energy distribution of the gd71 model is indistinguishable from that of a pure - h composition from 10 - 10000 , except in a few narrow regions which include p lines .",
    "bruhweiler ( 1984 ) reported the possible detection of nv , civ and siiv resonance lines in a single iue spectrum of gd71 but concluded that these were most likely formed in a halo region around the star . a subsequent examination of a coadded dataset derived from the three existing iue echelle spectra failed to confirm the existence of these features at the 30 m  equivalent width level and instead detected only the strong resonance lines of interstellar oi and si ii ( holberg et al .",
    "hence the current work represents the first probable detection of a heavy element in the atmosphere of the flux standard star gd71 .",
    "phosphorus was first revealed in the atmospheres of the hot da white dwarfs g191-b2b and mct0455 - 2812 by far ultraviolet orfeus observations ( vennes et al .",
    "subsequently , photospheric phosphorus has been reported in the fuse spectra of a significant number of other hot ( t@xmath6@xmath740000k ) hydrogen rich degenerates ( e.g. gd246 , feige 55 , wolff et al .",
    "2001 and re1032 + 532 , dupuis et al .",
    "however , to date , phosphorus has been detected in the atmospheres of only two das with t@xmath6 @xmath1640000k , gd394 ( t@xmath6@xmath839500k ; chayer et al .",
    "2000 ) and gd659 ( t@xmath6@xmath836000k ; dupuis et al .",
    "the white dwarfs analysed in this paper , therefore , represent the three coolest das in which photospheric phosphorus has yet been found .      while the presence of a close cool companion can lead , through accretion of wind material , to heavy element contaminatation in a white dwarf atmosphere ( e.g. v471 tauri ; sion et al .",
    "1997 ) it seems rather unlikely that this is the source of the phosphorus observed in these stars .",
    "for example , maxted et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find no evidence of radial velocity variations in gd71 , while dobbie et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have used near - ir spectroscopy to set a limit of m@xmath160.072m@xmath17 on the mass of any such companion .",
    "furthermore , 2mass data provides no evidence of a near - ir excess to either rej1917 + 488 or rej0605 - 482 ( e.g. skrutskie et al .",
    "while the presence of a close substellar companion to any of these stars can not be excluded , recent work by farihi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argues against this .",
    "alternatively , equilibrium radiative levitation calculations indicate that observable quantities of phosphorus should be supported in the photospheres of typical da white dwarfs to t@xmath6@xmath832500k ( vennes et al .",
    "indeed , the phosphorus abundances we measure for these three stars seem to be satisfyingly consistent with the theoretical values ( see their figure 4 ) . at face value",
    ", the lowest and largest abundance is measured in the coolest and hottest star respectively .",
    "however , the results of a preliminary study of the fuse spectra of 28 hot da white dwarfs indicate that this agreement might be simply fortuitous . in many objects with 35000k@xmath11t@xmath6@xmath1155000k",
    ", phosphorus is found to be underabundant , often strongly , with respect to the predictions ( dupuis et al .",
    "the abundance of an element , in equilibrium , is generally depth dependent ( e.g. schuh 2005 ) .",
    "the predictions of vennes et al .",
    "( 1996 ) correspond to the phosphorus abundance at the rosseland photosphere ( @xmath18@xmath82/3 ) , which may differ significantly from that in the line formation region from which the observed abundances are determined . therefore , to appraise the rle of radiative levitation in more detail",
    "we have constructed a small number of fully self - consistent h+p model atmospheres . in these calculations",
    "we have used information on the ionization fraction of phosphorus and the detailed radiation field gleaned from synspec to determine the effective gravitational downward forces and the upward radiative forces on phosphorus ions as a function of depth in the atmosphere .",
    "an estimate of the phosphorus abundance at each depth point has been obtained by equating these forces ( e.g. chayer et al .",
    "the estimates have been fed back into tlusty and an updated model structure determined .",
    "the entire process has been repeated until the abundances converge to @xmath113% throughout most of the atmosphere . in the uppermost layers",
    "this restiction has been relaxed to @xmath1110% but has no significant impact on the emergent spectrum .",
    "the results of these calculations consolidate previous predictions that detectable levels of phosphorus remain supported in the atmospheres of typical da white dwarfs at the effective temperatures examined here",
    ". however , the metal absorption lines predicted by our non - lte models are considerably stronger than those observed in the fuse data .",
    "for example , if we attempt to fit our homogeneous grid to the emergent spectra from the self - consistent calculations with effective temperatures and surface gravities appropriate to re j1918 + 595 and gd71 , we derive [ p / h]@xmath8 - 7.3 .",
    "if instead we fit the self - consistent models to the observed phosphorus features only , fixing the effective temperature at the values determined in  3.1 , we find the element abundance profile appropriate to log g=8.43 , 8.44 and 8.45 provides the best representation of these data , for re j0605 - 482 , gd71 and re j1918 + 595 respectively .",
    "these gravities are greater by @xmath50.6 dex than those estimated from the lyman line series .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the results from our modelling and the predictions of vennes et al .",
    "( 1996 ) likely stems from the abundance of phosphorus at the rosseland photosphere , log@xmath19 ( model column mass depth ) @xmath5 - 2 , decreasing rapidly with effective temperature at t@xmath6@xmath1135000k , while in the p line forming region , log@xmath19 ( model column mass depth ) @xmath5 - 3.5 , maintaining a greater value .",
    "interestingly , in their analysis of the euve spectra of 26 da white dwarfs ( t@xmath6 @xmath740000k ) , where a grid of self - consistent stratified models was compared by eye to the data , allowing effective temperature and surface gravity to , in effect , vary freely , schuh et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found , more often than not , the calculation which best represented the observed energy distribution of a white dwarf had a larger surface gravity ( @xmath50.4 dex ) than the value determined for the star via balmer line fitting . schuh ( 2005 ) has estimated that the complexities in accurately calculating the radiative force on an element in a stellar photosphere , e.g. due to the opacities of other metals , can result in uncertainties of up to 2 dex in the abundances derived at some depth points in their calculations .",
    "we note that the three white dwarfs analysed here are more metal poor and somewhat cooler than those typical of her sample , lying in a range where non - lte models replicate the structure of the stellar photosphere more satisfactorily ( barstow et al .",
    "indeed , test calculations reveal that the inclusion of additional metals , e.g. c and si , has no significant impact on the p abundance profile . however , robust and comprehensive atomic data for p are not available from topbase ( cunto & mendoza 1992 ) so shortcomings in the current model ions and linelists for this element may counter any advantage here .",
    "of course the balance between radiative levitation and gravitational settling can be disturbed by massloss . from a series of exploratory time dependent calculations involving si , chayer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) find that at moderate mass loss rates ( 10@xmath20@xmath11@xmath21@xmath1110@xmath22m@xmath17 yr@xmath14 ) , the reservoir of this element is exhausted after a few@xmath2310@xmath24 years , after which it is depleted rapidly from the stellar photosphere ( few@xmath2310@xmath25 yrs ) to levels well below the detection threshold of the fuse data . at very low rates of massloss",
    "( e.g. @xmath21@xmath1110@xmath26m@xmath17 yr@xmath14 ) the si abundance profile is essentially that predicted by equilibrium radiative levitation theory up to the end of their calculations .",
    "the mere detection of phosphorus in these three stars would appear to argue against massloss at the larger rates discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , it seems plausible that this process may be operating at low levels in these stars and that it is the slow exhaustion of an underlying reservoir of this element which results in observed abundances below the equilibrium radiative levitation prediction .",

    "<S> we report the detection , from fuse data , of phosphorus in the atmospheres of gd71 and two similar da white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first detection of a trace metal in the photosphere of the spectrophotometric standard star gd71 . </S>",
    "<S> collectively , these objects represent the coolest da white dwarfs in which photospheric phosphorus has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> we use a grid of homogeneous non - lte synthetic spectra to measure abundances of [ p / h]=@xmath0 , -8.70@xmath1 and -8.36@xmath2 in gd71 , re j1918 + 595 and re j0605 - 482 respectively . at the observed level we find phosphorus has no significant impact on the overall energy distribution of gd71 . </S>",
    "<S> we explore possible mechanisms responsible for the presence of this element in these stars , concluding that the most likely is an interplay between radiative levitation and gravitational settling but possibly modified by weak mass loss .    </S>",
