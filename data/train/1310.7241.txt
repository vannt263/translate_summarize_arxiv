    "let @xmath3 be a genus @xmath4 smooth , irreducible projective curve , defined over an algebraically closed field @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 be coverings to genus @xmath8 curves @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 the jacobians of these curves respectively .",
    "a classical question is to determine when the jacobian @xmath10 is isogenous to a product of @xmath11 .",
    "the problem has been studied in the xix century by legendre , jacobi , hermite , klein , kovalevskaya , hecke , et al . in this context , these curves were of interest due to the fact that split jacobians give relations between abelian and elliptic integrals .",
    "most of these efforts were focused on the case when the coverings @xmath12 are galois coverings .",
    "the case when genus @xmath13 for some @xmath14 and @xmath6 not necessarily galois is especially interesting due to its implications in number theory and relations to lang s conjecture ; see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when @xmath15 such coverings have different ramification structures when @xmath16 is odd or even ; see @xcite for a summary of results in genus two . in both cases",
    "the moduli space of such covers with fixed ramification structure can be embedded as a subvariety of @xmath17 .",
    "the jacobian @xmath10 is said to ( completely ) split if it is isogenous to the product of elliptic curves .",
    "ekedahl and serre @xcite posed the following questions : i ) is it true that for every integer @xmath18 there exists a curve of genus @xmath19 with split jacobian ?",
    "ii ) is there a bound on the genus of a curve with split jacobian ? towards answering these questions they used modular curves , and coverings of curves of genus 2 and 3 .",
    "the maximal genus of their examples was 1297 .",
    "many other authors have considered these questions as well , and in recent work , shaska @xcite and yamauchi @xcite , have produced somewhat unusual families of curves with decomposable jacobians .    in this paper we will focus on the cases when the coverings @xmath6 are cyclic galois coverings .",
    "hence , these coverings induce automorphisms on @xmath3 . by focusing on such curves we have a more organized way to study the decompositions of such jacobians starting from the automorphism group @xmath20 of @xmath3 .",
    "while we can determine the full list of groups that occur as full automorphism groups of genus @xmath21 , the corresponding equations of curves for each group are not known ; see @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a nice family of curves when such decomposition can be fully explored and the factors of such jacobians can be fully determined . this is the class of superelliptic curves , namely the curves which can be written as affine varieties with equation @xmath22 for some @xmath23 and discriminant @xmath24 . for such curves we know precisely the structure of the automorphism group @xmath25 , the signature , the equations of the curves , and their invariants ; see @xcite .",
    "hence , it is possible to determine explicitly the components of such jacobians and in some cases the moduli space of such curves in the moduli space @xmath26 .",
    "a complete description of curves for which such decompositions is based on their automorphisms is intended in @xcite .",
    "the second goal of the paper is to extend the family of curves introduced by yamauchi in @xcite .",
    "the family of curves introduced in @xcite are non - hyperelliptic curves with arbitrary large genus such that the jacobian has hyperelliptic components .",
    "we attempt to extend this family to curves whose jacobians have superelliptic components .",
    "our proof is based on the automorphisms of curves .",
    "we show that such decomposition based on the automorphisms of the curve induces some arithmetic condition among the orders of such automorphisms .",
    "this condition implies that the family @xmath27 constructed in @xcite agrees with our family of curves only for the values @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly define the jacobian of a curve and give two classical results of accola ; see @xcite . in these results",
    "it is described how one can start from a partition of a group of automorphisms of the curve @xmath3 and get a decomposition of the @xmath10 .",
    "further in this section we describe results of kani and rosen were the previous results were generalized ; see @xcite .",
    "we use such results in our decomposition of jacobians of the superelliptic curves for the family of curves described in section 4 .    in section 3 we study the decomposition of jacobians of superelliptic curves .",
    "a superelliptic curve @xmath3 is a curve with equation @xmath22 defined over a field @xmath5 , where @xmath30 and @xmath5 is algebraically closed .",
    "such curves have the _ superelliptic _ automorphism @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is an @xmath2-th primitive root of unity and @xmath33 is central in @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be another automorphism of @xmath3 such that its projection @xmath36 has order @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath35 and @xmath37 fix two subfields of the function field @xmath38 and therefore there are two quotient curves @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we determine equations of @xmath41 and @xmath42 and a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 such that @xmath10 is isogenous to @xmath43 .    in section 4 we generalize a construction of yamauchi of a family @xmath27 of non - hyperelliptic curves with decomposable jacobians , where all components are hyperelliptic jacobians .",
    "instead we construct a family @xmath44 of curves whose jacobians are superelliptic jacobians .",
    "we prove that the automorphism group of these _ component curves _ are cyclic or dihedral groups .",
    "moreover , we find a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for this decomposition to occur .",
    "our decomposition is based solely on the decomposition induced by the automorphisms of the curves .",
    "* notation : * throughout this paper by @xmath19 we denote an integer @xmath47 and @xmath5 denotes an algebraically closed field . unless otherwise noted , by a _ curve _ we always mean the isomorphism class of an algebraic curve defined over @xmath5 .",

    "an abelian variety is called * completely decomposable * or * completely split * if it is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves .",
    "a map of algebraic curves @xmath69 is called a * maximal covering * if it does not factor over a nontrivial isogeny .",
    "a map @xmath69 induces maps between their jacobians @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath72 is maximal then @xmath73 is injective and @xmath74 is connected , see @xcite for details .",
    "hence , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is some abelian variety .",
    "thus , coverings @xmath69 give factors of the jacobian @xmath10 .",
    "such methods have been explored for genus 2 curves by shaska et al . in @xcite .",
    "they are the only examples that we know when explicit computations have been performed and the corresponding locus has been computed for non - galois coverings .    if the covering @xmath69 is a galois covering then its monodromy group is isomorphic to a subgroup @xmath77 of the automorphism group @xmath78 .",
