    "a complex scalar field theory with a suitable self - interaction can lead to stationary localized solutions called @xmath0-balls @xcite , because the global phase invariance of the scalar field theory is associated with a conserved charge @xmath0 .",
    "when the theory is coupled to electromagnetism , this charge represents the electromagnetic charge of the @xmath0-balls @xcite .",
    "recently , a special type of scalar potential was considered @xcite .",
    "leading to the signum - gordon equation for the scalar field , this potential gives rise to spatially compact @xmath0-balls @xcite .",
    "the scalar field of these spherically symmetric configurations is finite inside a ball of radius @xmath1 , but vanishes identically outside this radius . in this respect",
    "the compact @xmath0-balls resemble stars .",
    "interestingly , when coupled to electromagnetism , the balance of forces allows for shell - like configurations @xcite . in these @xmath0-shells",
    "the scalar field vanishes identically both inside a certain radius @xmath2 and outside a certain radius @xmath1 , thus forming a shell of charged matter of size @xmath3 . with increasing charge the shell radii increase , allowing for arbitrarily large @xmath0-shells .",
    "note , that the shells considered here are thick shells , in contrast to the often considered thin shells ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    when the scalar field is coupled to gravity ,",
    "branches of globally regular self - gravitating solutions emerge from the @xmath0-ball solutions , corresponding to boson stars @xcite .",
    "the compact @xmath0-balls then give rise to compact boson stars .",
    "likewise , in the presence of gravity the compact @xmath0-shells turn into compact shells of self - gravitating charged matter , gravitating boson shells @xcite .",
    "recently , we have analyzed the properties and the domain of existence of these compact boson stars and gravitating boson shells @xcite .",
    "the gravitating boson shells surround a flat minkowski - like interior region , @xmath4 , while their exterior region @xmath5 is described by the part @xmath5 of a reissner - nordstrm solution , which possesses the same charge and mass as the shell . unlike the @xmath0-shells in flat space , however , the gravitating boson shells can not carry arbitrarily large charge . as the charge increases the mass increases as well , until a limiting solution is reached . here",
    "the mass within the shell radius @xmath1 becomes too big for a regular shell space - time to persist , and a throat is formed at @xmath1 .",
    "the exterior space - time @xmath5 then corresponds precisely to the exterior of an extremal reissner - nordstrm solution",
    ".    however , the shells need not be empty in their interior @xmath6 .",
    "instead of flat minkowski space the gravitating boson shells can harbour a schwarzschild like black hole there @xcite .",
    "this black hole has its event horizon @xmath7 in the interior region @xmath8 , where the scalar field vanishes and the gauge potential is constant . since the black hole is surrounded by a shell of charged boson matter , the presence of the scalar field outside the event horizon may be interpreted at scalar hair .",
    "thus the black hole theorems forbidding scalar hair under a great variety of circumstances @xcite can be eluded in this model .",
    "here we show , that the shells may also harbour charge in their interior @xmath6 . the flat space shells may contain point charges at their center , whereas the gravitating boson shells may either harbour charged black holes or naked singularities .",
    "these interior solutions are then described by reissner - nordstrm like solutions .",
    "thus a space - time arises , that consists of a reissner - nordstrm like interior @xmath6 , a boson shell @xmath3 , and a reissner - nordstrm like exterior @xmath9 .",
    "depending on the values of the mass and charge , the interior solution will be a subextremal black hole , an extremal black hole or a naked singularity .",
    "we analyze the properties of these boson shell solution carrying charge also in their interior @xmath6 , and we determine their domain of existence . we show that as in the case of the uncharged interior solutions , a throat can develop at the outer radius @xmath1 .",
    "this renders the exterior space - time an exterior extremal reissner - nordstrm space - time . at the same time",
    "the temperature of the black hole event horizon @xmath7 in the interior tends to zero . when the interior black hole solution becomes extremal , a further increase of the charge in the interior results in a naked singularity surrounded only by the shell .",
    "moreover , space - times exist which possess both an extremal interior black hole solution as well as an outer throat .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the action , the equations of motion and the ansatz for the fields .",
    "we also specify the boundary conditions , discuss the global charges , and present mass theorems for the solutions .",
    "in section 3 we discuss boson shells with a minkowski like interior and with a schwarzschild like interior .",
    "we then turn in section 4 to the boson shells carrying charge in their interior , which may be point like or in the form of a charged black hole .",
    "we analyze the energy conditions for all of these solutions in section 5 , and end with our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "a discussion of the special spiral like behaviour of the solutions , which occurs when the event horizon approaches the inner shell radius , is presented in the appendix .",

    "the respective mass relation for black holes space - times within boson shells follows in the isolated horizon framework @xcite .",

    "to set the stage for the discussion of the boson shell solutions with neutral black holes in their interior , we begin by briefly recalling the basic properties and the domain of existence of the boson shells with minkowski like interior @xcite .      in boson shells we need to distinguish 3 regions of the space - time . in the inner region @xmath111 the gauge potential is constant and the scalar field vanishes .",

    "the middle region @xmath3 represents the shell of charged boson matter .",
    "the outer region @xmath114 , finally , equals to the outer part of a reissner - nordstrm space - time ( for a naked singularity since the charge of the boson shell is larger than the mass ) . in this outer region",
    "the gauge field exhibits the standard coulomb fall - off , while the scalar field vanishes identically .",
    "( a typical boson shell solution is seen in fig .",
    "[ s0a ] , where it represents the beginning of a branch of solutions with schwarzschild like interior . )",
    "the domain of existence of these gravitating boson shells depends on the strength of the gravitational coupling @xmath115 . for a given finite value of the gravitational coupling ,",
    "boson shells emerge from the boson star solutions , when the scalar field vanishes at the origin , @xmath116 .",
    "the value of the outer radius @xmath1 at the bifurcation point depends on the strength of the gravitational coupling .",
    "it decreases monotonically from @xmath117 for vanishing coupling @xmath118 to @xmath119 for the maximal coupling @xmath120 , for which boson shells exist .",
    "when the value of the inner shell radius @xmath2 is increased from zero while the gravitational coupling constant is kept fixed , the corresponding branch of boson shells is obtained . with increasing inner shell radius @xmath2 also the outer radius @xmath1 increases .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ sha ] , where the ratio @xmath61 of both shell radii is shown versus the outer radius @xmath1 . along with the shell radii",
    "also the mass @xmath81 and the charge @xmath0 of the shells increase , as seen in fig .",
    "[ shb ] .    since the mass increases faster than the outer shell radius ( and also faster than the charge )",
    ", one can expect , that at a given point there will be too much mass within a region of radius @xmath1 to still allow for globally regular solutions .",
    "indeed , the branches of boson shells end , when a throat is formed at the outer radius @xmath1 .",
    "as this happens , the value of the gauge field function @xmath121 reaches zero at the inner radius @xmath2 ( or equivalently @xmath122 , since @xmath121 is constant in the interior , @xmath123 ) .",
    "the outer space - time @xmath124 then corresponds to the exterior of an extremal reissner - nordstrm space - time .",
    "such an extremal reissner - nordstrm space - time requires a certain relation between the horizon radius @xmath7 , the mass @xmath81 and the charge @xmath0 . in our units and with the horizon at the outer shell radius @xmath1",
    "this relation becomes @xmath125 as seen in fig .",
    "[ shb ] , this relation indeed holds at the endpoints of the boson shell branches .",
    "we finally note , that for large gravitational coupling , the boson shell branches end long before the inner and outer shell radii become comparable in size .",
    "in contrast , for small gravitational coupling , the boson shell branches extend much further and end only when the two shell radii are almost of the same size .",
    "however , as long as the gravitational coupling is finite , the growth of gravitating boson shells is limited by gravity . only in flat space boson shells",
    "can have arbitrarily large mass , charge and size @xcite .",
    "let us now address the case , when a schwarzschild like black hole is immersed in the interior region @xmath6 of the boson shell , first discussed in ref .",
    "thus the minkowski like inner region @xmath4 of the space - time of gravitating boson shell solutions is replaced by the inner part of a curved schwarzschild like space - time , where the event horizon resides at @xmath127 .",
    "the metric in the interior region @xmath4 is then determined by the schwarzschild metric function @xmath128 and a constant metric function @xmath129 .",
    "a set of such solutions with increasing event horizon @xmath7 is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ bhs0 ] .",
    "the presence of the boson shell outside the event horizon of the black hole influences the metric in the interior region of the shell .",
    "since @xmath130 is monotonically increasing for @xmath131 and constant for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , this implies @xmath134 .",
    "consequently , for an asymptotically flat space - time , i.e. , @xmath135 , the metric function @xmath130 assumes some value @xmath136 in the interior region @xmath6 of the space - time , instead of the ( usual ) schwarzschild value @xmath137 .",
    "the boson shells with schwarzschild like black holes in their interior are obtained from the empty boson shells , by imposing the presence of an event horizon @xmath7 and increasing its value from zero . in the following",
    "we discuss the main features of these boson shell space - times with electrically neutral black holes , by considering some generic cases @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider solutions with small charge and with large charge .",
    "clearly , solutions with large charge are possible only for small values of the gravitational coupling , whereas solutions with small charge are also possible for larger values of the gravitational coupling .",
    "indeed , for a given value of the charge the gravitational coupling can not exceed a critical value , which decreases with increasing charge .",
    "we begin with schwarzschild like black holes within boson shells which carry only a small charge , and choose @xmath138 for definiteness . varying the gravitational coupling between @xmath139 and 0.15 , we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ bhs1 ] the main properties of these solutions .",
    "their domain of existence is seen in fig .",
    "[ s1a ] , where the radius of the event horizon @xmath7 is exhibited versus the outer shell radius @xmath1 . when the event horizon is increased from the limiting value of zero ( of the empty shells ) the outer shell radius @xmath1 decreases .",
    "this decrease may be interpreted as due to the gravitational attraction from the black hole in the interior of the shell .",
    "obviously , the event horizon is limited in size , since the shell is limited in size .",
    "however , the physical reasons that limit the growth of the event horizon , and thus the growth of the inner black hole , differ for small and large values of the gravitational coupling . for small values of the gravitational coupling constant , the branches of boson shells with schwarzschild like black hole solutions in their interior exhibit a spiral like behaviour , when approaching their endpoints . here",
    "the event horizon @xmath7 and the outer shell radius @xmath1 exhibit an oscillatory behaviour , as they converge towards limiting values .",
    "( the first few branches of the spirals are apparent in fig .  [ s1a ] and",
    "enlarged in the inlet for a representative value of the gravitational coupling constant , @xmath140 , while the higher branches are too small to be resolved there . ) in contrast , for larger values of the gravitational coupling constant the branches of boson shells with schwarzschild like black hole solutions in their interior exhibit a monotonic behaviour . here",
    "the radii @xmath7 and @xmath1 approach their maximal values at the endpoints of the branches monotonically .",
    "the mass @xmath81 of the solutions is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ s1b ] and follows this pattern . for small values of the gravitational coupling",
    "the mass exhibits a spiral like behaviour .",
    "thus for given values of the charge and the mass , there are several different solutions .",
    "these solutions form a countable set , where the number of solutions increases as the values of the mass and the charge are chosen closer to the values of the mass and the charge of the limiting solution of the spiral . thus for those limiting values at the endpoint of the spiral a maximal ( possibly infinite ) number of discrete solutions should be present , all with the same mass and the same charge . consequently these black hole space - times surrounded by boson shells violate uniqueness @xcite .",
    "these black holes carry scalar hair in the form of compact boson shells .",
    "let us now address the endpoints of the branches of boson shells with schwarzschild like black holes more closely , in order to understand the physical reasons causing the branches to end .",
    "for that purpose we consider the behaviour of the inner shell radius @xmath2 and the horizon radius @xmath7 as we move into the spiral .",
    "we note that while both oscillate , their ratio @xmath141 increases monotonically and converges to the limiting value of one , as we approach the endpoint of the spiral .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ s1c ] and fig .",
    "since the horizon can not become bigger than the inner shell radius , these branches of black holes terminate when the event horizon coincides with the inner boundary of the shell .",
    "a further discussion of the spirals and their limiting solution is given in the appendix .    as we turn to the larger values of the gravitational constant we note that the branches end before the ratio @xmath141 tends to one .",
    "here the physical mechanism causing the branches to terminate consists in the formation of a throat at the outer shell radius @xmath1 . to understand the reason",
    "let us compare the mass @xmath81 and the charge @xmath0 of the solutions along these branches .",
    "in terms of reissner - nordstrm solutions , which describe the exterior solution @xmath142 , these values of the mass and the charge would correspond to reissner - nordstrm solutions with naked singularities at their center .",
    "along the branches we keep @xmath0 fixed and increase the horizon radius @xmath7 and with it the mass @xmath81 . thus along the branches the mass is getting steadily closer to the extremal value , where a degenerate horizon would be present in the reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "when the conditions for extremal reissner - nordstrm solutions , @xmath143 , finally become satisfied , a throat is formed at the outer shell radius @xmath1 .",
    "note that this analysis implies that uniqueness is not violated for these solutions .    as the throat forms",
    ", the temperature @xmath144 at the event horizon @xmath127 of the schwarzschild like black hole in the interior of the shell tends to zero .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ s1e ] . at first",
    "this vanishing of the temperature appears unexpected , since the schwarzschild like black hole is not charged .",
    "however , the reason for the vanishing of the temperature @xmath144 can be understood from the behaviour of the metric function @xmath130 in @xmath145 .",
    "the temperature @xmath144 of the black hole within the boson shell is given by @xmath146 where @xmath147 denotes the temperature of a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath148 .",
    "indeed , we observe , that the function @xmath130 tends to zero in the interior , when the throat is formed as seen in fig .",
    "[ s0d ] , thus leading to a vanishing temperature @xmath144 . on the other hand ,",
    "the divergence of the temperature @xmath144 with vanishing event horizon @xmath149 just reflects the usual schwarzschild behaviour .",
    "solutions with larger charge are only possible for small values of the gravitational coupling .",
    "let us for definiteness now consider solutions with charge @xmath150 , whose properties are demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ bhs2 ] . for the largest values of the gravitational coupling that are possible for this charge , the branches of solutions with a schwarzschild like black hole in the interior exhibit the same pattern as discussed above for the case of small charge and large gravitational coupling .",
    "these branches exhibit a monotonic behaviour , where the horizon radius and the mass increase with decreasing outer shell radius .",
    "the branches end when a throat is formed at the outer shell radius , when @xmath143 is satisfied .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ bhs2 ] for @xmath151 . clearly , with this monotonic behaviour the solutions exhibit uniqueness in this parameter range .    for smaller values of the gravitational coupling , however , the pattern changes , allowing for non - monotonic branches and thus , again , for nonuniqueness of the black hole solutions .",
    "the new pattern is seen in fig .",
    "[ bhs2 ] for @xmath152 and 0.01 .",
    "these large charge solutions have large outer and inner shell radii . with a ratio @xmath61 close to 1 , they seem like rather thin shells .",
    "( the proper distance from @xmath2 to @xmath1 can , of course , become arbitrarily large , as an extremal configuration is approached . )    as the horizon radius increases along these branches , the outer shell radius decreases while the mass increases .",
    "interestingly , now the scaled mass and charge become equal , @xmath153 , before the outer shell radius has sufficiently shrunk to satisfy the conditions for extremal reissner - nordstrm solutions , thus @xmath154 . consequently , a throat can not yet be formed . as the horizon is increased further , the mass increases further , and the exterior solution becomes the respective outer part of a reissner - nordstrm black hole solution , since now @xmath155 .",
    "the horizon then reaches a maximal value , similar to the case when spirals arise . beyond this value the horizon , the outer shell radius and the mass decrease , while the ratio @xmath141 continues to increase",
    "however , since both the outer shell radius and the mass decrease , they can and do reach the extremal reissner - nordstrm values @xmath156 . here a throat is formed at the outer shell radius and the branches end .    unlike the case of full spirals , however , we here have only two solutions for a given mass and charge , since a single bifurcation is present . these two black hole space - times have the same set of global charges but are otherwise distinct solutions of the einstein - matter equations , and thus black hole uniqueness is again seen not to hold in this model of scalar electrodynamics coupled to gravity .",
    "note that also pure reissner - nordstrm black holes exist in some parameter range ( i.e.  when @xmath157 ) , which possess the same global charges as the boson shells with interior black hole .",
    "we now replace the inner empty minkowski space of the boson shell by a point charge or by a charged reissner - nordstrm like black hole and consider the effect of these inner charges @xmath77 respectively @xmath68 on the physical properties of these solutions and on their domain of existence .      to get a first understanding of the physical effects in the presence of a charge @xmath77 in the interior region @xmath158 of the boson shells , we switch off gravity and consider flat space .",
    "we thus put a point charge at the origin of the minkowski space in the interior of the flat space boson shells .",

    "can then be extended far out . for opposite charges , in contrast",
    ", the force is attractive .",
    "this is expected to limit the relative magnitude of the charge , that can be put into the interior .",
    "the basic question that we would like to address is whether the negative charge in the interior region of the shell can become sufficiently large to cancel the positive charge carried by the boson shell itself and thus yield a globally neutral solution , i.e. , a solution with @xmath159 . to answer this question ,",
    "let us consider branches of solutions , where the global charge and the charge in the interior are varied . for convenience ,",
    "we choose fixed values of the gauge field function @xmath121 at the inner shell radius , while we vary the charges .",
    "this procedure then reveals the domain of existence of this type of solutions .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ sh2 ] , we can not reach globally neutral solutions .",
    "when the negative charge in the interior reaches sizeable values , the global charge does not decrease .",
    "instead an even larger positive charge carried by the shell is needed to accommodate the negative charge in the interior .",
    "thus the global charge does not decrease but increase . obviously , the attraction of the unlike charges is too big to allow for globally neutral solutions consisting of a charged boson shell and an oppositely charged point charge .",
    "the coupling to gravity does not change this basic fact , as discussed below .",
    "let us now turn to gravitating boson shells , which harbour a charged black hole in their interior , @xmath6 .",
    "these branches of solutions with a reissner - nordstrm like black hole in their interior emerge from the solutions with schwarzschild like black holes , when the black hole is endowed with a small charge @xmath68 , its horizon charge .",
    "the horizon charge @xmath68 is then increased or decreased from zero , while the remaining parameters @xmath30 , @xmath0 and @xmath7 are held fixed .    since the parameter space is rather large ,",
    "we focus in the following on three regions of the parameter space , covering the basic features which these solutions possess .",
    "let us first consider the case of small charge and small gravitational coupling , choosing ( as in the schwarzschild case ) the values @xmath138 and @xmath140 .",
    "we exhibit some of the properties of these solutions in fig .",
    "[ bh1 ] . in fig .",
    "[ f1a ] we show the ratio of the cauchy horizon radius @xmath71 to the event horizon radius @xmath7 for branches of solutions with fixed values of the event horizon @xmath7 . for positive horizon charge @xmath161 , these branches",
    "extend from the respective solutions with a schwarzschild like interior where @xmath162 , up to the solutions with an extremal charged black hole in the interior .",
    "the extremality condition can be expressed in terms of the event horizon @xmath7 and the cauchy horizon @xmath71 of the inner black hole @xmath163 the extremal endpoints of the branches are indicated in the figures by small asterisks . as seen in fig .",
    "[ f1c ] , along these branches the horizon charge @xmath68 rises monotonically from zero to the extremal value .    in order to reach shells with even larger charges in their interior",
    ", we can either consider reissner - nordstrm like solutions without horizons , i.e. , naked singularities inside the shells . alternatively",
    ", we can switch the role of the two horizons , and keep the cauchy horizon @xmath71 fixed , while we vary the event horizon @xmath7 .",
    "for the latter choice , we exhibit in fig .",
    "[ f1b ] the continuously extended branches of solutions , exhibiting the ratio of the event horizon radius @xmath7 to the cauchy horizon radius @xmath71 .",
    "the extremal solutions , where the two parts of the branches match , are marked by the asterisks .     in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath164 the value of the radius which is kept fixed , i.e.  @xmath165 along the lower parts , where @xmath71 is varied , and @xmath166 along the upper parts , where @xmath7 is varied .",
    "[ f1c]-[f1f ] then exhibit both parts of the branches , the fixed @xmath7 as well as the fixed @xmath71 parts , with both parts merging when the interior black hole solutions become extremal .",
    "as seen in [ f1c ] , the horizon charge @xmath68 becomes very large along the fixed @xmath71 parts of the branches , and assumes values rather close to the global charge @xmath0 .",
    "thus the horizon charge becomes almost as large as possible .",
    "like @xmath68 the mass @xmath81 varies smoothly along both parts of these branches , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f1d ] .",
    "let us now consider the endpoints of these branches of solutions .",
    "when the cauchy horizon is kept fixed , while the event horizon is increased , the boson shells become smaller , since the outer shell radius @xmath1 decreases monotonically . at the same time , the shell thickness @xmath167 decreases , yielding an increasing ratio @xmath61 , as seen in fig .",
    "most revealing is , however , the increase of the ratio @xmath141 of the event horizon to the inner shell radius , shown in fig .",
    "since this ratio goes to one , as the branches reach their endpoint , this signals that the branches end in spirals .",
    "a close inspection of the branches of solutions in the vicinity of the endpoints indeed reveals the presence of spirals .",
    "the temperature @xmath144 of these solutions is shown in fig .",
    "the temperature vanishes when the interior black hole solutions become extremal , otherwise the temperature is finite . to address the nonuniqueness of the solutions , we inspect fig .",
    "[ f2b ] , where the mass @xmath81 is shown as a function of the horizon charge @xmath68 for fixed global charge @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , now a continuous set of solutions possesses the same global charges @xmath81 and @xmath0 .",
    "such a set can for instance be obtained by varying the horizon radius @xmath7 . moreover , even if we were to add the horizon charge @xmath68 as a further charge to characterize the black hole space - times , uniqueness would not be recovered , as seen from the crossings of the branches in fig .",
    "note that also pure reissner - nordstrm black holes exist in some parameter range ( i.e.  when @xmath168 in fig .  [ f2b ] ) , which possess the same global charges as the boson shells with interior black hole .",
    "let us finally turn to solutions with negative charges in their interior .",
    "for that purpose we reconsider fig .",
    "clearly , the inner black hole solutions , that have so far been endowed with positive charge , can also be endowed with negative charge , leading to branches with negative horizon charge @xmath169 . however , the amount of negative charge that can be immersed in the interior of these solutions is only rather small as seen in fig .",
    "( because @xmath170 , small @xmath71 corresponds to small @xmath68 when @xmath7 and @xmath30 are fixed . )",
    "indeed , for solutions in the considered parameter range the horizon charge can not be decreased far and thus remains close to zero .",
    "since for negative horizon charge @xmath171 the ratio @xmath172 remains small as well , we zoom into this region in fig .",
    "[ f2c ] . zooming in even further in fig .",
    "[ f2d ] we see that for certain parameters the horizon charge can even change back to become positive again before such a branch with fixed horizon radius @xmath7 ends .",
    "addressing now the endpoints of these brnaches , we note that for small values of the event horizon radius @xmath7 , where only one solution with vanishing horizon charge exists , the branches with negative horizon charge end in spirals , e.g. , for  @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "in contrast , if there are two solutions with vanishing horizon charge for a given event horizon radius @xmath7 , then the branch of solutions with negative horizon charge connects these two solutions .",
    "moreover , in this case a second branch with positive horizon charge exists , which emerges from the second solution with vanishing horizon charge and ends in a spiral as seen in fig .",
    "[ f2c ] and fig .",
    "[ f2d ] for @xmath175 .",
    "this pattern continues when more than two solutions with vanishing horizon charge exist for a given horizon radius @xmath7 , i.e. , in the spirals , leading to more branches with positive respectively negative horizon charges , connecting pairs of solutions with vanishing horizon charge .",
    "note finally that in fig .",
    "[ bh1 ] and fig .",
    "[ bh2 ] the branch with @xmath176 does not possess a limit with zero horizon charge , and ends in a spiral with @xmath177 .",
    "next we turn to solutions for larger gravitational coupling @xmath178 and small charge @xmath138 . in fig .",
    "[ f3a ] we show the ratio @xmath172 versus the outer shell radius @xmath1 for several fixed values of @xmath7 , and in fig .",
    "[ f3b ] the ratio @xmath179 for several fixed values of @xmath71 . as before ,",
    "branches of solutions with charged black holes emerge from the solutions with schwarzschild like black holes .",
    "interestingly , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f3c ] , now the negative horizon charge can assume a considerably larger magnitude as compared to the previous case . thus the negative horizon charge branches extend much further .",
    "these branches end in spirals , when the ratio of the horizon radius to the inner shell radius @xmath141 tends to one , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f3f ] .",
    "the branches with positive horizon charge and fixed horizon radius extend up to the extremal case , where @xmath180 .",
    "however , for negative horizon charge the branches can now also reach the extremal case , when ( for the parameters employed ) the event horizon radius is below @xmath181 .",
    "increasing the magnitude of the charge in the interior further , can then yield boson shells with naked singularities in their interior , carrying positive or negative charge .",
    "alternatively , extending these branches beyond the extremal solutions by keeping the cauchy horizon fixed , while varying the event horizon , we see that the negative horizon charge solutions only form small loops connecting two extremal solutions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f3b ] for @xmath182 .",
    "in contrast , the branches with positive horizon charge black holes extend further , yielding boson shells of considerably smaller size .    whereas in the previous case described in section 4.2.1 the fixed @xmath71 branches ended also in spirals , we here observe the alternative endpoint scenario , namely the branches end when a throat is formed at the outer shell radius .",
    "this is obvious from fig .",
    "[ f3b ] and fig .",
    "[ f3d ] , since the formation of a throat occurs when the conditions @xmath156 hold .",
    "clearly , the endpoints of all branches occur at an outer shell radius of @xmath183 , where the mass assumes the value @xmath184 .",
    "the formation of the throat at these endpoints is also seen in the temperature @xmath144 , exhibited in fig .",
    "evidently , the temperature goes to zero when the interior black hole solutions become extremal , as indicated by the asterisks .",
    "but the temperature also goes to zero at the end points of the branches , where a throat is formed .",
    "nonuniqueness , finally , is addressed in fig .",
    "[ f5b ] , where the mass is exhibited versus the horizon charge .",
    "again , we see a continuous nonuniqueness of the solutions containing charged black holes , as long as only the global charges are considered",
    ". the crossings of the branches , on the other hand , show that , as in the previous case , even with the introduction of a further charge @xmath68 uniqueness is not regained .",
    "next we turn to black hole solutions with large charge @xmath150 and small gravitational coupling @xmath139 . as in the above cases branches of solutions with positively and negatively charged interior black holes emerge from the solutions with schwarzschild like interior .",
    "the properties of these solutions are exhibited in fig .",
    "[ bh6 ] and fig .  [ bh7 ] .    considering first solutions with a positively charged interior black hole",
    ", we expect the same type of behaviour as above . with increasing horizon charge , the branches of fixed horizon size end when the inner black hole solution becomes extremal .",
    "from there these branches can be continued by retaining the cauchy horizon fixed while varying the event horizon .",
    "we observe this expected behaviour indeed , but only for the smaller values of the fixed horizon radius .",
    "these branches end , when a throat is formed at the outer shell radius , i.e. , when @xmath185 .",
    "however , for larger values of the fixed horizon radius , no longer an extremal black hole is encountered .",
    "instead , the branches reach a maximal value of @xmath172 and then bend backwards towards smaller values of the horizon charge and larger values of the shell size .",
    "the value @xmath186 shown in the figures , is slightly above the critical value @xmath187 , where this new type of behaviour sets in .",
    "these branches then reach a second solution with a neutral interior , different from the starting solution .    when the value of the fixed horizon radius is increased further , beyond a critical value there no longer exists a solution with a neutral interior black hole , and the branch of solutions with charged interior black holes closes on itself . above a maximal value of the horizon radius also solutions with charged interior black holes",
    "no longer exist .",
    "thus the behaviour of these branches of solutions depends on how many solutions with a neutral black hole in the interior exist for a given global charge and fixed horizon radius .",
    "the critical radius @xmath187 is precisely given by the transition point from one to two neutral interior solutions , readily identifiable in fig .",
    "[ bhs1 ] . here , as the throat is formed at the outer shell radius , the inner black hole solution becomes extremal , thus @xmath180 , but the horizon is still slightly smaller than the inner shell radius , and the inner shell radius is slightly smaller than the outer shell radius , @xmath188 .",
    "this space - time therefore satisfies the conditions for an extremal solution at two places , at @xmath7 and at @xmath1 .",
    "let us now extend the above analysis to solutions with negative horizon charges .",
    "the ratio @xmath172 for this type of solutions is considered explicitly in fig .",
    "[ f6b ] , while the other figures contain solutions with both positive and negative horizon charges . when there is only one solution with a neutral black hole in the interior , i.e. , when @xmath189 , then the branches with negative horizon charge show a spiral - like behaviour . on the other hand , when there are two solutions with a neutral black hole in the interior i.e. , when @xmath190 , then the branches with negative ( or positive ) horizon charges connect both of these solutions with vanishing horizon charge .",
    "the spiral - like behaviour indicates that the ratio of the event horizon radius to the inner radius @xmath141 tends to one .",
    "this is demonstrated in detail for @xmath191 in the inlet of fig .",
    "[ f6f ] , where we show the first ten branches . to extrapolate the endpoint ( diamond ) we made a fourth order approximation using the data at the minima and maxima of @xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "[ f7a ] we exhibit the temperature of these solutions .",
    "the temperature tends to zero when the inner black hole becomes extremal , which is indicated by the asterisks in the figure .",
    "the temperature also tends to zero , when a throat forms at the outer horizon radius . for the given values of the charge and gravitational coupling constant ,",
    "this happens when the outer shell radius reaches @xmath192 .",
    "in the figure we see the throat formation for @xmath193 and 9 .",
    "the continuous nonuniqueness of the solutions containing charged black holes is demonstrated in fig .",
    "note that also pure reissner - nordstrm black holes exist in some parameter range ( i.e.  when @xmath194 in fig .  [ f7b ] ) , which possess the same global charges as the boson shells with interior black hole .",
    "we now consider the energy conditions for these boson shell solutions with black holes in their interior . to that end",
    ", we define @xmath195 as a unit timelike vector field , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 is the stress energy tensor .",
    "then the weak and strong energy conditions read    [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     the dominant energy condition requires that for all future directed timelike @xmath195 , the vector @xmath198 is future directed timelike or null .",
    "if @xmath199 represents the four velocity of an observer then the weak energy condition states that the energy density as measured by any observer can not be negative , whereas the dominant energy condition states that the speed of the energy flow as measured by any observer can not exceed the speed of light .",
    "the strong energy condition guarantees that for a hypersurface orthogonal congruence the change of the expansion with respect to proper time is negative .    to analyze the weak , strong and dominant energy conditions for the boson shell solutions we follow wald @xcite . for a diagonal stress - energy tensor @xmath200",
    "the weak energy condition can be expressed as @xmath201 the strong energy condition requires @xmath202 and for the dominant energy condition @xmath203 has to hold .    in the interior ( @xmath132 ) and exterior ( @xmath204 ) of the shell all energy conditions are satisfied , since here the space - time is of reissner - nordstrm type .",
    "in order to analyze a possible violation of the energy conditions it is sufficient to restrict to the shell @xmath3 . for the boson shell solutions",
    "the energy density and the pressures are given by @xmath205    from eqs .",
    "( [ ecrho])-([ecpp ] ) it can immediately be seen that the weak energy condition is satisfied . for the dominant energy condition",
    "we find @xmath206 both inequalities are of the form @xmath207 , which is always satisfied .",
    "hence the dominant energy condition is also fulfilled . for the strong energy condition",
    "we note that @xmath208 may become negative for some solutions . for the schwarzschild case , e.g. @xmath209 and @xmath210 near @xmath211 .",
    "thus for these solutions the strong energy condition is violated . however , for the reissner - nordstrm case @xmath212 at @xmath211 .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f9a ] examples of solutions for which the strong energy condition is violated in some bounded region of space - time .",
    "however , there are also solutions for which the strong energy condition is everywhere satisfied , as seen in fig .",
    "( for convenience we show the quantity @xmath214 ) .",
    "we have considered boson shells in scalar electrodynamics with a @xmath215-shaped scalar potential , implying that the scalar field is finite only in a compact shell - like region , @xmath3 .",
    "coupling the scalar field to gravity leads to self - gravitating boson shells with an empty minkowski - like interior region @xmath6 . however",
    ", the interior region need not be empty . in flat space , the interior region can contain a point charge . in curved space ,",
    "the interior region can either contain a black hole or a naked singularity .    while the flat space solutions can grow without bound ,",
    "the domain of existence of the self - gravitating solutions is limited .",
    "the reason is , that gravity does not allow for regular solutions , which have a large mass concentrated in a ( too ) small region . indeed ,",
    "when the solutions approach the boundary of the domain of existence , a throat develops at the outer radius of the shells , making the exterior region of the space - time equal to the exterior region of an extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "when the boson shells carry like charges in their interior , these give rise to electromagnetic repulsion of the surrounding boson shell .",
    "when the charges located in the interior of the shell are of opposite sign , however , further attraction arises that supplements the gravitational attraction . when the resulting attraction becomes too large , shell - like solutions are no longer possible .",
    "in particular , the attraction resulting from opposite charges is too big , to allow for globally neutral shell - like solutions .    analyzing the physical properties of these types of solutions we have found , that space - times with a black hole inside the boson shell can possess the same values of the global charge @xmath0 and the same values of the global mass @xmath81 , while they differ in other physical properties .",
    "consequently , uniqueness does not hold for these black hole space - times .",
    "instead they possess scalar hair in the form of charged compact shells .",
    "when the inner black holes are neutral , there can only be denumerably many such solutions with the same global charges .",
    "these are present for sets of solutions with a spiral - like behaviour .",
    "in contrast , when the inner black holes carry charge a continuous nonuniqueness of the solutions arises .",
    "the black hole uniqueness theorems @xcite are evaded for these solutions because of the special type of potential , making the scalar field vanish identically outside the boson shell .",
    "note that in the proof of non - existence of black holes with scalar hair @xcite the asymptotic form of the scalar field is essential .",
    "for our solutions however , the scalar field vanishes at some finite radius @xmath1 and stays identically zero for @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the proof of @xcite does not apply to the compact boson shells harbouring black holes",
    ".    the next step will be to consider rotation @xcite . while rotating boson stars are well - known @xcite , the inclusion of rotation for self - gravitating boson shells will present an interesting generalization .",
    "however , the implementation and subsequent numerical construction of such rotating boson shells which may also harbour black holes still represents a challenge .",
    "so far we have considered only solutions which have an empty minkowski like interior , or possess point - like charges , schwarzschild like black holes or reissner - nordstrm like solutions in the interior of the boson shells .",
    "it would be interesting to consider also compact boson stars inside the boson shells .",
    "this would lead to space - times with an onion like shell structure : a compact boson star surrounded by a reissner - nordstrm like solution surrounded by a boson shell surrounded by a reissner - nordstrm like solution . in principle",
    "this kind of solutions can be extended further to include also multiple boson shells .",
    "bk gratefully acknowledges support by the dfg , ml by the dlr .",
    "we here elucidate the limiting behaviour of the solutions , when the branches of boson shells harbouring black holes end in spirals .",
    "a particular case for the occurrence of a spiral pattern was shown in fig .",
    "[ s1a ] , where sets of boson shell solutions with schwarzschild like black holes in their interior were exhibited for small gravitational coupling . as discussed above , such a spiral pattern arises in the limit when the event horizon and the inner boundary of the shell approach each other and finally coincide , i.e. , when @xmath216 .    in order to demonstrate how the solutions behave in this limit",
    ", we choose two typical examples for gravitational coupling constant @xmath139 .",
    "the first one has charge @xmath138 and a schwarzschild - like black hole in the interior ; the second one has charge @xmath150 and a negatively charged reissner - nordstrm like black hole in the interior . in both cases",
    "we consider a sequence of solutions with increasing values of the ratio @xmath141 .",
    "it is convenient to employ the radial coordinate @xmath217 . in fig .",
    "[ xnf1a ] we show the function @xmath218 versus @xmath219 . in the first example",

    "away from the maximum , the function @xmath220 approaches a limiting function labeled ` @xmath221 ' in fig .",
    "[ xnf1a ] . in the second example",
    "we observe that the number of extrema of @xmath220 increases with increasing @xmath141 . but similar to the previous example it seems that the locations of the extrema tend to zero ( except for the two outer most extrema ) as @xmath141 tends to one .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ xnf2a ] .",
    "note that in this example the largest ratio @xmath222 is still not very close to the limiting value of one .",
    "the limiting solutions are obtained with boundary conditions different from the ones required for the boson shell solutions .",

    "we also require @xmath226 and @xmath43 at the horizon .",
