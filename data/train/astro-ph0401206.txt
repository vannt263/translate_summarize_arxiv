    "the possibility of probing the universe at high redshifts using the hi @xmath1 line has been the topic of extensive theoretical investigation .",
    "this is perceived to be the most promising window for studying the `` dark ages '' , the era between the decoupling of the cmbr from the primeval plasma at @xmath2 and the formation of the first luminous objects at @xmath3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) after decoupling the gas temperature @xmath4 is maintained at cmbr temperature @xmath5 through collisions of the cmbr photons with the small fraction of electrons that survive the process of recombination .",
    "the collision process becomes ineffective in coupling @xmath4 to @xmath5 at @xmath6 . in the absence of external heating at @xmath7",
    "the gas cools adiabatically with @xmath8 while @xmath9 .",
    "the spin temperature @xmath10 is strongly coupled to @xmath4 through the collisional spin flipping process until @xmath11 .",
    "the collisional process is weak at lower redshifts , and @xmath10 again approaches @xmath5 .",
    "this gives a range of redshifts where @xmath12 .",
    "we then have a window in redshift @xmath13 , or equivalently in frequency @xmath14 where the hi will produce absorption features in the cmbr spectrum .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "propose that observations of the angular fluctuations in the cmbr brightness temperature @xmath15 arising from the hi absorption can be used to study the power spectrum of density fluctuations at small scales to a level of accuracy far exceeding those achievable by any other means .",
    "the enormous wealth of information arises from the fact that observations at different frequencies which are sufficiently separated will provide independent estimates of the power spectrum at the same wave number @xmath16 .",
    "these observations will probe the power spectrum before the epoch of structure formation , and they hold the possibility of revealing the entire primordial power spectrum down to very small scales . in another recent paper @xcite have studied the linear fluctuations in the 21 cm emission from the pre - reionization era .",
    "they show that that it should be possible to detect this signal against the foreground contaminations in the frequency domain .",
    "this signal is expected to constrain the equation of state of the universe at high @xmath17 .",
    "the cmbr brightness temperature is related to @xmath10 and the hi number density @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath15 arise from fluctuations in @xmath18 directly and also through fluctuations in @xmath10 which in turn arise from fluctuations in @xmath18 . in calculating the fluctuations in @xmath10 ,",
    "@xcite consider only one process , namely the change in the collision rate arising from fluctuations in @xmath18 .",
    "perturbations in @xmath18 will also produce perturbation in @xmath4 , which in turn will affect @xmath10 .",
    "this effect has not been taken into account in their work .",
    "density perturbations produce peculiar velocities .",
    "this causes the frequency of the hi absorption features to be shifted by the line of sight component of the peculiar velocity .",
    "this effect will rearrange the hi absorption features in frequency space where converging velocity patterns appear as enhancements in the hi number density and diverging velocity patterns appear as decrements in the hi number density .",
    "it may be noted that this is the familiar linear redshift space distortion ( kaiser effect , @xcite ) seen in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "this effect has been studied by @xcite in the context of cosmological hi emission from @xmath20 .",
    "it is important to identify and take into account all possible contribution to the brightness temperature fluctuations , if these are to be used to extract precise information about the power spectrum and the equation of state of the universe . in this paper",
    "we study two effects which will contribute to brightness temperature fluctuations , namely ( 1 . ) perturbations in the gas temperature produced by density fluctuations , and ( 2 . )",
    "the effect of redshift space distortions . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "these effects have not been included in earlier works .",
    "we next present an outline of the paper . in section 2 .",
    "we discuss the processes involved in determining the brightness temperature fluctuations and present the relevant equations . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our results and discuss their consequences .",
    "it may be noted that we have used @xmath21 whenever specific values have been needed for the cosmological parameters .",
    "we first consider the evolution of the gas temperature after the recombination era @xmath22 when it becomes largely neutral .",
    "this is governed by the equation @xmath23 the third term in the above equation represents the energy transfer from the cmbr to the gas through the collisions with the residual electrons @xcite .",
    "this terms tries to maintain the gas temperature at the cmbr temperature as the universe expands .",
    "the second term is the change in @xmath4 in adiabatic expansion .",
    "if the hi is uniformly distributed , then @xmath24 and in the absence of the cmbr heating we have @xmath8 .",
    "collisions are able to maintain @xmath25 up to a redshift @xmath26 ( figure [ fig : a1 ] ) after which @xmath27 .",
    "we next consider the evolution of the spin temperature @xmath10 which is defined through the relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the population densities and @xmath31 , @xmath32 the spin degeneracy factors of the excited and the ground states of the hi 21 cm transition . in this equation @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the planck s constant , @xmath35 is the frequency corresponding to the 21 cm line and @xmath36 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the evolution of the ground state population density is governed by two processes , one collisional and the other radiative @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the scale factor , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the collisional excitations and de - excitation rates of the hyperfine levels , @xmath41 is the einstein spontaneous emission coefficient , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the einstein @xmath44 coefficients and @xmath45 is the specific intensity of the background radiation at @xmath46 .    in the regime of our interest",
    "@xmath47 and we can use the approximation @xmath48 throughout . also , the fact that in equilibrium the collisional processes and the radiative process are separately balanced gives us the relations @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "the collisional de - excitation rate can be written as @xmath52 where the values of @xmath53 is tabulated as a function of @xmath4 @xcite . using these and equation ( [ eq : a3 ] ) we obtain an equation for the redshift evolution of @xmath10 @xmath54 \\label{eq : a4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the collisional term tries to set the spin temperature at the same value as the gas temperature while the radiative term tries to set it at the cmbr temperature , which process dominates being decided by the rate coefficients . at high redshifts the collisional process dominates and the spin temperature closely follows the gas temperature . at lower redshifts",
    "@xmath18 falls substantially , the collisional process looses out to the radiative process and the spin temperature approaches the cmbr temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : a1 ] shows the evolution of the spin temperature as the universe expands .",
    "we next shift our attention to the effect of hi density perturbations @xmath56 .",
    "these will produce fluctuations in the gas temperature .",
    "if the gas were undergoing adiabatic expansion , the fluctuations in the gas temperature @xmath57 would be related to @xmath58 through @xmath59 .",
    "this will get modified because of the energy that is pumped into the gas from the cmbr and @xmath60 during the era when @xmath61 .",
    "we define a function @xmath62 .",
    "such that @xmath63 . using this in equation ( [ eq : a1 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath64 the first term in rhs arises from the coupling of the gas to the cmbr and it tries to set @xmath65 while the second term corresponds to adiabatic expansion and it tries to make @xmath66 .",
    "the quantity @xmath67 is expected to evolve from @xmath68 to @xmath69 as the universe expands and the contribution of the heat pumped into the gas goes down .",
    "an interesting feature is that @xmath67 depends on the growth rate of density fluctuations . for example",
    ", it follows from equation ( [ eq : a5 ] ) that a static density perturbation which does not evolve in time will not produce fluctuations in the gas temperature .",
    "here we assume that @xmath58 follows the dark matter perturbation and grows as @xmath70 .",
    "the result of integrating equation ( [ eq : a5 ] ) is shown in figure [ fig : a2 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath71 in the redshift range of our interest ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "and @xmath73 defined in the text.,width=317 ]    we finally come to the fluctuations in the spin temperature @xmath74 produced by density perturbations . from equation ( [ eq : a4 ] )",
    "we see that fluctuations in @xmath10 can arise from changes in @xmath4 and from changes in the collision rate .",
    "the changes in collision rate @xmath75 will come about directly through changes in @xmath18 and also through changes in @xmath4 which will affect the value of @xmath53 .",
    "taking into account both these effect we have @xmath76 . defining a function @xmath77 .",

    "we find that @xmath80 for @xmath81 _ ie .",
    "_ a positive density perturbation causes the spin temperature to go up , and the effect is opposite at @xmath82 .    during the era",
    "when @xmath12 the hi along a line of sight @xmath83 reduces the cmbr brightness temperature at the frequency @xmath84 by an amount @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the optical depth of the 21 cm hi absorption given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the comoving distance to the hi whose 21 cm absorption is redshifted to @xmath84 .",

    "hi density perturbations produce fluctuations in the decrement of the cmbr brightness temperature by two means ( 1 . ) through fluctuations in the optical depth , and ( 2 . ) through fluctuations in the spin temperature . the effect of changes in the optical depth in response to a positive density perturbation ( curve a of fig .",
