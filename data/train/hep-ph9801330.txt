    "the running coupling in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath4 ) scheme @xcite and other dimensional regularization schemes is traditionally constructed by solving the renormalization group equations using perturbative approximants to the @xmath5 function which change discontinuously at the quark mass thresholds @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to using effective lagrangians with a fixed number of massless fermions in each energy range between the quark mass thresholds .",
    "thus in the @xmath4 scheme , the @xmath6 function depends on the number of `` massless '' quarks @xmath7 which is taken as a step function of the renormalization scale @xmath1 . matching conditions at threshold",
    "require the equivalence of one effective theory with @xmath8 massless flavors to another effective theory with one massive and ( @xmath9 ) massless quarks .",
    "it should be noted that this does not prevent one from including quark masses in the @xmath4  scheme .",
    "however , the quark masses do not enter into the @xmath5 function since the running of the coupling is mass independent .",
    "the one - loop matching conditions @xcite in the @xmath4 scheme require the coupling to be continuous if the matching is done at the quark masses , although the derivative is discontinuous . in two - loop matching",
    "@xcite the coupling itself becomes discontinuous if the matching is done at the quark masses , but it can be rendered continuous by modifying the @xmath4 scheme @xcite .",
    "recently the three - loop matching conditions have been computed @xcite , which together with the four - loop @xmath5-function @xcite , give the possibility to evolve the @xmath4 coupling to four loops with massless quarks .",
    "this gives a reduced dependence on the matching scale , as shown in @xcite , but possibly a nonphysical threshold dependence .",
    "however , in such a treatment the derivatives of the coupling remain discontinuous .",
    "the inevitable result of the matching in a dimensional regularization scheme is that the running of the @xmath4 coupling in the renormalization scale is nonanalytic ",
    "nondifferentiable or even discontinuous  as the quark mass thresholds are crossed .",
    "thus there is an intrinsic difficulty in expressing physical , smooth observables as an expansion in the @xmath10 coupling .",
    "it is clearly necessary to restore the finite quark mass effects in their entirety in order to restore analyticity .",
    "aesthetically , it is unnatural to characterize physical theories in terms of an artificially - constructed renormalization scheme such as @xmath4 ; it is more physical to use an effective charge as determined from experiment to define the fundamental coupling @xcite .",
    "for example , in analogy to quantum electrodynamics , one could choose to define the qcd coupling as the coefficient @xmath11 in the static limit of the scattering potential between two heavy quark - antiquark test charges : @xmath12 at the momentum transfer @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the casimir operator for the fundamental representation in @xmath15 , ( with @xmath16 for qcd ) .",
    "such an effective charge automatically incorporates the quark mass threshold effects in the running , and thus it has an analytic @xmath5 function .",
    "the  scheme is particularly well - suited to summing the effects of gluon exchange at low momentum transfer , such as in evaluating the final - state interaction corrections to heavy quark production @xcite , or in evaluating the hard - scattering matrix elements underlying exclusive processes @xcite .",
    "a physical effective charge has the additional advantage that the appelquist - carazzone decoupling theorem @xcite is automatically incorporated .",
    "in this paper we shall construct an analytic extension of the scheme , which we call , by connecting the coupling directly to the analytic and physically - defined  scheme .",
    "the necessity for an analytic coupling has been emphasized by shirkov and his collaborators@xcite .",
    "our definition allows one to use a scheme based on dimensional regularization , but which also , in a simple way , treats mass effects properly between the mass thresholds .",
    "thus , instead of having the number of effective flavors ( @xmath17 ) change discontinuously at ( or nearby ) the quark threshold , we obtain an analytic @xmath18 which is a continuous function of the renormalization scale @xmath1 and the quark masses @xmath19 .",
    "thus the analytically - extended scheme inherits the mass dependence of the physical scheme .",
    "in addition , the renormalization scale @xmath1 that appears in the analytically - extended scheme  is directly related to the momentum transfer appearing in the  scheme and thus has a definite and simple physical interpretation .",
    "the essential advantage of the modified scheme  is that it provides an analytic interpolation of conventional dimensional regularization expressions by utilizing the mass dependence of the physical  scheme . in effect , quark thresholds are treated analytically to all orders in @xmath20 ; _ i.e. _ , the evolution of our analytically extended coupling in the intermediate regions reflects the actual mass dependence of a physical effective charge and the analytic properties of particle production in a physical process . just as in abelian qed , the mass dependence of the effective potential and the analytically - extended scheme  reflects the analyticity of the physical thresholds for particle production in the crossed channel .",
    "furthermore , the definiteness of the dependence in the quark masses automatically constrains the renormalization scale .",
    "alternatively , one could connect  to another physical charge such as @xmath21 defined from @xmath22 annihilation .",
    "our approach should be compared with the standard treatment of quark mass threshold effects in the @xmath4  scheme . for fixed order in @xmath23 the corrections due to finite quark mass threshold effects which we are considering in this paper",
    "have been calculated for the hadronic width of the z - boson and the @xmath24 lepton semihadronic decay rate @xcite .",
    "the calculations have been made both exactly to order @xmath25 and as expansions in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath26 for light and heavy quarks respectively .",
    "note that in principle the determination of the finite mass threshold effects for physical observables in dimensional regularization schemes would require a complete all - orders analysis of the higher - twist mass corrections to the effective lagrangian of the theory .",
    "there are a number of other reasons to construct an analytic extension of the  scheme :    * the comparison of the values of the coupling @xmath23 as determined from different experiments and at different momentum scales is an essential test of qcd ( for a recent review of existing measurements see @xcite ) .",
    "one source of error is neglect of quark masses in the determination of @xmath23 and in the subsequent running of the coupling from the scale where it has been determined to the conventional reference scale , the @xmath27-boson mass .",
    "* lattice calculations for the j/@xmath28 and @xmath29 spectra now provide the most precise determination of @xmath23 at low momentum scales@xcite .",
    "it is important to know how finite quark mass effects enter into the running of this value of @xmath23 to lower and higher energy scales with as small an error as possible . *",
    "finite mass threshold effects in supersymmetric grand unified theories are important when analyzing the running and unification of couplings over very large ranges .",
    "it has been discussed , for example , in refs .",
    "however , the scale used in the running and for the threshold effects has not been related to the physical scale which is naturally obtained in our approach . *",
    "it is natural to unify theories by matching physical couplings and masses at the unification scale .",
    "this can be accomplished in the  scheme or equivalently .",
    "in the case of the abelian theory , the coupling @xmath2 derived from the heavy lepton potential is equivalent to using the effective charge defined from the running of the photon propagator . in the non - abelian theory",
    "the gluon propagator is not gauge invariant ; one thus has to turn to a physical gauge invariant observable such as the heavy quark potential .    the effective charge @xmath30 , defined as in eq .",

    "we can then relate the @xmath4  scheme to the  scheme through a commensurate scale relation @xcite , which is effectively a scale transformation between the two schemes .",
    "the analytic dependence of  is then transferred to the analytically - extended  scheme .",
    "the usual massless expressions are recovered far above or far below any individual quark mass threshold .",
    "the coupling @xmath47 , which is derived from heavy quark scattering , is closely related to the renormalization of the gluon propagator . in physical gauges with @xmath48",
    "the coupling renormalization is due purely to self - energy insertions in the propagator .    for the purposes of this paper it will be sufficient to restrict our analysis to one - loop order - function .",
    "however , at small scales the higher order terms will become important , especially since the relative importance of the @xmath17 term is larger for @xmath49 than for @xmath50 .",

    "this should be compared with the analytic @xmath4  scheme where @xmath17 is increased continuously in the running .    to compare the analytic extension of the @xmath4  scheme with the standard @xmath4  result for @xmath130",
    "we will apply the blm scale - setting procedure also for the standard @xmath4  scheme .",
    "this is to ensure that any differences are due to the different ways of treating quark masses and not due to the scale choice . in other words",
    "we want to compare eqs .",
    "( [ eq : agms ] ) and ( [ eq : aganalytic ] ) .",
    "as the normalization point we use @xmath159 which we evolve down to @xmath160 using leading order massless evolution with @xmath161 .",
    "this value is then used to calculate @xmath162 in the @xmath4  scheme using eq .",
    "( [ eq : agms ] ) . finally , eq .  ( [ eq : aganalytic ] )",
    "gives the normalization point for @xmath163 .",
    "[ fig : gdiff ] shows the relative difference between the two expressions for @xmath130 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : agms ] ) and ( [ eq : aganalytic ] ) respectively . as can be seen from the figure",
    "the relative difference is smaller than 0.2% for scales above 1 gev .",
    "thus the analytic extension of the @xmath4  scheme takes the mass corrections into account in a very simple way without having to include an infinite series of higher dimension operators or doing complicated multi - loop diagrams with explicit masses .",
    "an essential feature of the ( q ) scheme is that there is no renormalization scale ambiguity , since @xmath46 is the physical momentum transfer .",
    "the  scheme naturally takes into account quark mass thresholds , which is of particular phenomenological importance to qcd applications in the intervening mass region between those thresholds . in this paper",
    "we have utilized commensurate scale relations to provide an analytic extension of the conventional @xmath4   scheme in which many of the advantages of the  scheme are inherited by the  scheme , but only minimal changes have to be made to the standard  scheme . given the commensurate scale relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : csrmsofv ] ) , connecting  to expansions in  are effectively expansions in  to the given order in perturbation theory at a corresponding commensurate scale . unlike the conventional  scheme , the modified  scheme is analytic at quark mass thresholds , and it thus provides a natural expansion parameter for perturbative representations of observables . in the abelian limit @xmath164 ,  scheme agrees with the standard effective charge method of qed .",
    "we have found that taking finite quark mass effects into account analytically in the running , rather than using a fixed @xmath17 between thresholds , leads to effects of the order of one percent for the one - loop running coupling , with the largest differences occurring near thresholds .",
    "these differences are important for observables that are calculated neglecting quark masses and could in principle turn out to be significant in comparing low and high energy measurements of the strong coupling .",
    "we have also found that our extension of the @xmath4  scheme , including quark mass effects analytically , reproduces the standard treatment of quark masses in the @xmath4  scheme to within a fraction of a percent .",
    "the standard treatment amounts to either calculating multi - loop diagrams with explicit quark masses or adding higher dimension operators to the effective lagrangian .",
    "these corrections can be viewed as compensating for the fact that the number of flavors in the running is kept constant between mass thresholds . by utilizing the blm scale setting procedure , based on the massless @xmath17 contribution ,",
    "the analytic extension of the @xmath4  scheme correctly absorbs both massless and mass dependent quark contributions from qcd diagrams , such as the double bubble diagram , into the running of the coupling .",
    "this gives the opportunity to convert a calculation made in the @xmath4  scheme with massless quarks into an expression which includes quark mass corrections from qcd diagrams by using the blm scale and replacing  with .    for simplicity",
    "we have analyzed the mass corrections arising from analyticity only to leading order in qcd .",
    "for further precision , our analysis will need to be systematically improved .",
    "for example , at higher orders the commensurate scale relation connecting  to will have to be corrected with finite mass effects .",
    "we have seen that the blm scale minimizes the difference between the analytic and the conventional -coupling .",
    "thus , these kinds of corrections are not likely to decrease the difference between the analytic and the conventional -coupling .",
    "finally , we note the potential importance of utilizing the effective charge or the equivalent analytic  scheme in supersymmetric and grand unified theories , particularly since the unification of couplings and masses would be expected to occur in terms of physical quantities rather than parameters defined by theoretical convention .",
