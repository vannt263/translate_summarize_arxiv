    "in high - temperature superconductors , one remarkable feature is rapid destruction of n ' eel order by hole doping .",

    "[ fig_doping ] , the @xmath53 regime is also shown .",
    "contrary to the other regimes , there is no antiferromagnetic heisenberg type correlations in this regime .",
    "therefore , spin fluctuations in this regime are disconnected to the original spin correlations at half - filling .",

    "now let us consider the strong coupling limit , @xmath55 . since the hund coupling term is dominant in this regime , we move to a frame in which the hund coupling term is diagonalized .",
    "in such a frame , the doped hole s spin at the @xmath56-site is in the direction of the localized spin moment @xmath13 .",
    "the transformation to this frame is given by @xmath57 where the matrix @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 after this transformation , the action reads @xmath60 .",

    "note that @xmath65 describes ferromagnetic correlations and @xmath66 describes antiferromagnetic correlations in the localized spin system .",
    "in fact , @xmath67 is taken for the mean field in the forromagnetic spin system and @xmath68 is taken for the mean field in the antiferromagnetic spin system in the schwinger boson mean field theory.@xcite .",
    "a similar action can be derived in the slave - fermion mean field theory of the t - j model .",
    "however , there is a crucial difference .",
    "if we take the strong coupling limit of @xmath55 , then one finds that the fermion hopping only couple to ferromagnetic correlations in the localized spin system .",
    "therefore , coupling between fermions and the gauge field that describes antiferromagnetic fluctuations is absent .",
    "in this paper , we investigate effects of doped holes hopping on n ' eel order .",
    "what we have found is that disorder effects induced by holes hopping on n ' eel order is rather small .",
    "in fact , the critical doping concentration is @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "this value is substantially larger than that in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "therefore , hopping processes of doped holes are not so effective in suppressing n ' eel order . for destruction of n ' eel order in high - temperature superconductors",
    ", holes must behave like an excitation which suppresses n ' eel order more effectively .",
    "such an excitation would be intimately connected with properties of the localized spin system .",
    "after destruction of n ' eel order , the quantum disordered phase appears .",
    "( this quantum disordered phase is special to the antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "in fact , there is no such phase in case of the ferromagnetic correlations because there is no quantum fluctuations that suppress the semiclassical long - rage order as in the antiferromagnetic case . )",
    "if we take the strong coupling limit @xmath71 , then the coulping between the doped holes and the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are lost . here",
    "we first derive the spin - fermion model starting from the hubbard model . after representing the localized spin moments by the schwinger bosons , we take the strong coupling limit .",
    "there is another way of taking this strong coupling limit .",
    "if we take the strong coupling limit first at the spin - fermion model , it is believed that the model is reduced to the t - j model . applying the slave - boson theory",
    ", we obtain a system of spinless fermions and bosons with a gauge field interaction . in the derivation of the slave - boson representation of the t - j model ,",
    "one big assumption is that there is a deconfinement phase of a u(1 ) gauge field theory . whether there is a deconfinement phase or not is still an unsolved issue .",
    "by contrast , there is no need to assume a deconfinement phase when we introduce boson fields to describe the localized spin moments at the spin - fermion model . after taking the strong coupling limit",
    ", we obtain a system of spinless fermions and bosons but there is no gauge field interaction .",
    "our analysis suggests that taking the strong coupling limit is not justified or indirectly suggests that there is no deconfinement phase . a situation such that taking the strong coupling limit is not allowed occurs when there is a term of spin - orbit coupling like @xmath72 .",
    "in the presence of such a term , doped holes rotate their spin at every hopping process.@xcite therefore , we can not take the strong coupling limit .",
