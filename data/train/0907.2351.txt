    "photoproduction can be observed in ultra - peripheral heavy ion collisions ( upcs ) , which occur when the impact parameter @xmath5 is more than twice the nuclear radius @xmath6 and an electromagnetic field of one nucleus interacts with another nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic field of a relativistic nucleus may be represented as a flux of almost - real virtual photons , following the weizscker - williams method  @xcite .",
    "the photon flux scales as the square of the nuclear charge and so the cross - sections can be large in heavy ion interactions",
    ". these photons can fluctuate into a quark - antiquark pair , which can scatter elastically from the other nucleus , emerging as a real vector meson .",
    "also , purely electromagnetic interactions can take place .",
    "these processes can be described as two - photon interactions ( in most cases ) at energy scales below  @xmath7 .",
    "processes with multiple photon exchanges are possible which may excite the target nuclei into a giant dipole resonance or higher excitation states .",
    "when excited nuclei decay they emit one or more neutrons .",
    "several data sets were used to study the production cross section of @xmath8 mesons at @xmath9 = 62 , 130 and 200  gev  . the star detector description , trigger setup and data analysis details can be found elsewhere  .",
    "recent results obtained with data collected at @xmath9 = 200  gev allowed a detailed comparison between measured cross section and theoretical prediction  @xcite .",
    "the cross section comparison is shown in left panel of fig .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    due to the narrow acceptance in rapidity , we can not distinguish between those theoretical models based on the shape .",
    "however , the measured cross section value can be used to eliminate models which significantly overestimate the total production cross - section in the measured rapidity range .    during the year",
    "2004 run star took data of auau collisions at @xmath9 = 62  gev .",
    "the data set was accumulated with minimum bias trigger and contains mainly coherently produced @xmath8 accompanied by the mutual excitation . the event selection and analysis procedure",
    "closely follow the one outlined in  .",
    "the measured @xmath8 coherent production cross section with mutual excitation was compared with theoretical prediction and found to be in agreement with the model described in  @xcite .",
    "as was mentioned earlier the photoproduction can occur at large impact parameter @xmath5 . for the @xmath8 photoproduction",
    "the median impact parameter @xmath11 is about 46 fm ( topology triggered data ) which means that the @xmath8 source consists of two well - separated nuclei . as the result",
    "there are two indistinguishable possibilities : either nucleus 1 emits a photon which scatters off nucleus 2 , or vice versa so that the system acts like a 2-slit interferometer with slit separation @xmath5 .",
    "since the produced vector mesons have negative parity , the two amplitudes combine with opposite signs and as the result the cross section is @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the amplitudes for @xmath8 production at rapidity @xmath15 and transverse momentum @xmath16 from the two photon directions .    the produced @xmath8s decay almost immediately at two well - separated points ,",
    "so any interference must develop after the decay , and involve the @xmath17 final state .",
    "since the pions go in different directions , this requires an entangled @xmath17 wave function which can not be factorized into separate @xmath18 and @xmath19 wave functions .",
    "a measurement of the two - source interference is sensitive to any loss of quantum mechanical coherence , be it due to interactions with the environment @xcite or as a characteristic of the @xmath8 decay .",
    "figure  [ finalcross ] right shows the efficiency corrected minimum bias ( mb ) and topology data .",
    "all four distributions show a dip at small @xmath10 .",
    "the dip at low @xmath20 is broader for the mb data because @xmath11 is smaller .",
    "the suppression at @xmath21 is larger for the small - rapidity samples because the amplitudes for the two photon directions are more similar .",
    "the @xmath22 spectrum is fit by the 3-parameter form @xmath23 , \\label{eq : fit}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the ratio of the simulated @xmath20-spectra with and without interference , @xmath25 is an overall ( arbitrary ) normalization and @xmath26 gives the degree of spectral modification .",
    "we measured the interference to be at @xmath27(stat.)@xmath28 ( syst.)% of the expected level  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that the final state wave function retains amplitudes for all possible decays , long after the decay occurs .      during the 2004 and 2007 runs star took data in auau colisions at @xmath30  gev with modified version of the minimum bias trigger",
    "the trigger has been modified to accept events with multiplicity similar to events with four charged primary tracks .",
    "the measurement of diffractive photoproduction of charged four - pion states available right now are mostly from @xmath31 and @xmath32 fixed target experiments at photon energies below 10 gev . the heaviest nucleus used up to this point was carbon and photon energies ranging from 50 to 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "the experiments observed a broad peak at the order of 200 mev in the range from 1430 to 1500 mev / c@xmath33 .",
    "one possible explanation is that this distribution is caused by the overlap of two separate states @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in the data analysis events with four charged tracks with net charge zero and with total transverse momentum below 150",
    "mev / c have been selected .",
    "the cut on the transverse momentum ensures that selected events have been coherently photoproduced .",
    "right plot shows @xmath16 distribution of coherently produced @xmath29 .",

    "the invariant mass distribution consist of approximately 100 candidates  @xcite .",
    "previous fixed target experiments observed @xmath37 as an enchancement in the @xmath38 decay mode .",
    "star data show no significant enhancement around 1500 mev / c@xmath33 in the double pion decay mode .",

    "the production of @xmath2 mesons is observed with and without accompanying coulomb nuclear excitations .",
    "the differential cross section has been measured as the function of rapidity , invariant mass and @xmath20 which allowed to isolate the incoherent part of the @xmath8 production .",
