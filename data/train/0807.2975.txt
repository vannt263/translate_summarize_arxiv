    "the epoch of reionization ( eor ) marks the second major change in the ionization state of the universe after recombination and is directly linked to structure formation .",
    "reionization begins when the first structures form within dark matter halos and emit neutral hydrogen ionizing photons .",
    "in addition to changing the ionization state , these first structures also affect subsequent structure formation due to various radiative , mechanical and chemical feedback effects .",
    "thus , to probe reionization , one needs an excellent understanding of initial density perturbations and their growth , as well as simulations that can trace the evolution of structure formation .",
    "one of the major challenges of reionization models is to be able to simultaneously account for the considerable , and often apparently conflicting , amount of data accumulated by experiments exploiting qso absorption line spectra ( fan et al .",
    "2006 ) , cosmic microwave background radiation ( page et al . 2007 , spergel et al . 2007 ) and high redshift galaxy surveys ( bouwens et al .",
    "2006 , stark et al .",
    "2007 ) .    the emerging picture ( choudhury & ferrara 2007 ) is one in which hydrogen reionization is an extended process starting at @xmath20 and being 90% complete by @xmath21 .",
    "reionization is initially driven by metal - free stars in low mass ( @xmath22 ) halos ; the conditions for the formation of these objects are soon erased by the combined action of chemical and radiative feedbacks at @xmath23 .    given the many assumptions necessarily made by reionization models , the above scenario needs constant confrontation with freshly acquired data sets . in this sense , it has been suggested ( malhotra & rhoads 2004 , 2005 ; santos 2004 ; haiman & cen 2005 ; mesinger , haiman & cen 2004 ; dijkstra , wyithe & haiman 2007 ; dijkstra , lidz & wyithe 2007 ; mesinger & furlanetto 2007 ) that a class of high redshift galaxies , the lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) can be suitably used to put additional constraints on the reionization history : the lyman break and the strength , width and asymmetry of the observed ly@xmath0 line make the detection of laes unambiguous . the strength of the method is based on the sensitivity of ly@xmath0 photons to even tiny amounts of in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . at redshifts @xmath24 , the optical depth to ly@xmath0 photons is very large .",
    "let @xmath25 be the electron charge , @xmath26 the oscillator strength ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 the wavelength of ly@xmath0 in its rest frame ( 1216  ) , @xmath29 the electron mass , @xmath30 the speed of light , @xmath31 the hubble parameter at the required redshift , @xmath32 the global neutral hydrogen density and @xmath33 the global mean hydrogen density at that redshift .",
    "note that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fraction of neutral hydrogen at the redshift under consideration .",
    "further , @xmath36 represents the baryonic density parameter and @xmath37 is the total ( baryonic + dark ) matter density parameter of the universe , @xmath38 .",
    "then , @xmath39 where @xmath40 hence , even a fraction of @xmath41 can lead to a significant attenuation of the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "the observed ( i.e. transmitted ) ly@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath42 , can then be used to infer the ionization state of the igm at redshifts close to those of the emitter and hence to reconstruct , at least piecewise , the cosmic reionization history .",
    "this simple picture is complicated by a number of important physical effects .",
    "first of all , ly@xmath0 photons from the stars have to propagate through and escape from the interstellar medium of the lae . during their travel",
    "they are multiply scattered by atoms ( thus being either removed from or added to the line of sight [ los ] ) and possibly absorbed by dust grains ( neufeld 1991 ; tasitsiomi 2005 ; hansen & oh 2006 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "these processes modify both the emerging ly@xmath0 luminosity and the shape and equivalent width of the line .",
    "second , the ionizing radiation from the same stars builds regions of ionized igm around the emitters , whose size depends on the star formation rate , age , escape of ionizing photons from the galaxy and the stellar initial mass function ( imf ; the case of very massive stars has been explored , for example , by dijkstra & wyithe 2007 ) . as a result",
    ", the flux redwards of the ly@xmath0 line can escape , attenuated only by the red damping wing of the gunn - peterson absorption ( miralda - escud 1998 ; madau & rees 2000 ) .",
    "to a first approximation , the spatial scale imposed by the gunn - peterson damping wing on the size of the region corresponds to a redshift separation of @xmath43 , i.e. about 200 kpc ( physical ) at @xmath44 .",
    "the effects of the damping wing fade away if the emitter is powerful enough to create a large enough region and/or if the universe is already reionized when the emitter turns on .",
    "alternatively , one would observe the damping wing if there were even a small fraction of neutral hydrogen left inside the sphere and/or if a cloud is present along the los to the source .",
    "all the above effects combine to shape the observed lae luminosity function ( lf ) , which has been now measured ( rhoads et al .",
    "2000 ; taniguchi et al . 2005 ; shimasaku et al . 2006 ; iye et al .",
    "2006 ; kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 ; murayama et al .",
    "2007 ; ota et al . 2007 ; dawson et al . 2007 ) with different degrees of accuracy up to @xmath45 .",
    "such tremendous progress has been made possible by the increase of survey fields and available samples .",
    "the current observational situation can be summarized as follows .",
    "all studies seem to converge toward the conclusion that there is very little indication of evolution of the lf moving from @xmath46 to @xmath6 . beyond that epoch",
    "there seems to be evidence of a decline in the lf , with @xmath47 at @xmath48 being about 50% of that at @xmath6 .",
    "such a high luminosity steepening of the lf can be produced by a number of different physical effects .",
    "a rapid evolution of the igm ionization state can be invoked ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 ) if the overlapping phase of reionization ended around @xmath49 ; however , the net effect of reionization on the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity of the most luminous ( and presumably massive ) laes is unclear .",
    "if these objects are expected to live in more dense and hence more neutral environments , they are also more heavily clustered ( mcquinn et al .",
    "the two effects might not change appreciably the size of their regions .",
    "alternatively , the observed evolution could be simply a result of the evolution of the mass function of dark matter halos housing the laes ( dijkstra , wyithe & haiman 2007 ; dijkstra , lidz & wyithe 2007 ) .",
    "finally , extinction due to dust , which is expected to be more prominent in actively star forming galaxies , may act as a sink for ly@xmath0 photons in the most luminous laes .    as of now",
    ", it is difficult to firmly assess which of these explanations is more robust .",
    "fortunately , other aspects of the data , such as the line shape and equivalent width , might allow one to make progresses .",
    "here we try to assess to what extent the reionization history can affect the shape of the lf and the observed properties of individual laes .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to some of those mentioned above , but it has the strength of being based on reionization models that simultaneously account for all the available data beyond laes including ly@xmath0/ly@xmath50 gunn - peterson opacity , electron scattering optical depth , lyman limit systems , cosmic sfr history and the number density of high - redshift sources . , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53)=(0.24 , 0.76 , 0.022 , 0.72 ) .",
    "the parameters defining the linear dark matter power spectrum are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we use a value of @xmath57 much higher that quoted from wmap3 ( 0.76 ) as the combination of wmap3 and sdss data give @xmath58 ( 0.86 ) for low ( high ) resolution ly@xmath0 forest data ( viel et al .",
    "mpc is comoving unless otherwise specified . ] .",
    "in this section we describe the physical features of the model we have developed to derive the various properties of laes which will then be compared with observations .",
    "several steps are required in order to carry out this task which are described in detail in the following .",
    "these include the use of the sheth - tormen mass function to obtain the redshift dependence of the number density of dark matter halos , the star formation prescriptions required to build the luminosity function , the production rate of ionizing photons and the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity , the size of the strmgren sphere built by laes and the density profile within it and in the general igm , for which we use a previously developed reionization model .",
    "we start with the well known sheth - tormen mass function , @xcite , which is used to calculate the number density of dark matter halos of mass between @xmath59 and @xmath60 at any redshift @xmath61 , represented by @xmath62 , as    @xmath63    where @xmath64 .    in eq.[stormen ] , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are modifications to the original press - schechter mass function , @xcite , to make it agree better with simulations . here , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "further , the variance of the mass @xmath59 contained in a radius @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 in eq.[sig ] , @xmath77 is the window function that represents the fourier transform of a spherical top hat filter of radius @xmath75 , @xmath78 is the power spectrum of the density fluctuations , extrapolated to @xmath79 using linear theory where @xmath80 is the amplitude of the density fluctuations calculated by normalizing @xmath81 to @xmath57 which represents the variance of mass in a sphere of size @xmath82 mpc at @xmath79 .",

    "the attenuation of the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity by the igm , as calculated in sec 2.4 , then allows the mass function to be translated into the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "the baryonic mass , @xmath86 , contained within a halo of mass @xmath87 can be expressed as @xmath88 we assume that a fraction @xmath89 of this baryonic matter forms stars over a timescale @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the duty cycle and @xmath92 is the hubble time at @xmath79 .",
    "thus , we can write the star formation rate ( sfr ) as @xmath93    using the population synthesis code starburst99 @xcite we obtain the hydrogen ionizing photon rate , @xmath94 , emitted by galaxies having a given sfr , assuming a metallicity @xmath95 . determining the metallicity of the laes proves very challenging , as for most of the cases , only the ly@xmath0 line can be detected from these objects .",
    "to guess their metallicity , we use the results from studies of lbgs ( lyman break galaxies ) and dla ( damped ly@xmath0 ) systems , which indicate values of @xmath96 , which justifies our assumption , @xcite .",
    "we use a kroupa imf with a slope of 1.3 between @xmath97 and @xmath98 and 2.35 between @xmath99 and @xmath100 . using the fact that @xmath94 scales linearly with sfr",
    ", we can calculate @xmath94 for the desired sfr .",
    "star formation in laes produces photons with energy @xmath101  ryd .",
    "these photons ionize the interstellar , leading to the formation of free electrons and protons inside the emitter . due to the high density of the ism",
    ", these then recombine on the recombination time scale , giving rise to a ly@xmath0 emission line .",
    "let @xmath102 be the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy without causing any ionizations , @xmath103 the fraction of ly@xmath0 photons that escape the galaxy without being destroyed by dust , @xmath104 be the frequency of ly@xmath0 in the rest frame of the galaxy ( 1216  ) and @xmath53 be the planck constant .",
    "then , the _ intrinsic _ ly@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath105 , from the galaxy can be expressed as    @xmath106    it has been calculated that there is a two - thirds probability of the recombination leading to a ly@xmath0 line and a one - third probability of obtaining photons of frequencies different from the ly@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the factor of two - thirds in eq.[lya ] .",
    "for @xmath107 , the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity and the sfr are related by the following @xmath108    modeling the ly@xmath0 line to be doppler broadened , the complete line profile is @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 is the rotation velocity of the galaxy and @xmath30 is the speed of light .",
    "the minimum rotation velocity of the galaxy would be equal to the rotation velocity of the host halo , @xmath112 .",
    "however , for more quiescent star formation , for realistic halo and disk properties , @xmath111 can have values between @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xcite .",

    "the _ intrinsic _ ly@xmath0 line is attenuated by the neutral hydrogen present in the igm along the line of sight toward the emitter . in this section we compute the neutral hydrogen distribution and the attenuation caused by it .",
    "we use the global value of the fraction @xmath127 resulting from the modeling by @xcite , further refined in @xcite .",
    "the main features of the model are summarized here .",
    "mildly non - linear density fluctuations giving rise to spectral absorption features in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are described by a log - normal distribution .",
    "this has been shown to fit the observed probability distribution function of the transmitted flux between redshifts 1.7 and 5.8 by @xcite . for a given igm equation of state ,",
    "this being the temperature - density relation , the mean global fraction ( @xmath35 ) can be computed from photoionization equilibrium as a function of baryonic over - density ( @xmath128 ) and photoionization rate ( @xmath129 ) due to the ultra - violet background radiation field .",
    "these quantities must be determined from a combination of theory and observations .",
    "@xcite included two types of ultraviolet photons : from qsos and pop ii stars .",
    "the free parameters in their model were ( i ) the sfr efficiency ( @xmath89 ) and ( ii ) the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the galaxy ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "these were calibrated to match the redshift evolution of lyman - limit systems , ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath50 optical depths , electron scattering optical depth , cosmic sfr history and number density of high redshift sources .",
    "the following reionization scenarios provide a good fit to observational data : ( i ) early reionization model ( erm ) , in which reionization ends at @xmath130 , ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) , ( ii ) late reionization model ( lrm ) , where reionization ends at @xmath133 , ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) .",
    "the igm is approximately in local photoionization equilibrium . under such conditions ionizations",
    "are balanced by recombinations , @xmath136 where @xmath32 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 are the number density of neutral hydrogen , protons and electrons respectively , @xmath139 is the hydrogen case b recombination coefficient and @xmath129 is the ionization rate due to the background . as mentioned in sec.[chi cal ] , in this work we take advantage of the results presented by @xcite .",
    "once that @xmath35 is fixed to the their values , the photoionization rate contributed by the ionizing background light produced by quasars and galaxies is given by : _",
    "b = ( 1-_hi)^2_hi n_h _ b. moreover , the radiation from stars inside the galaxy ionizes the region surrounding the emitter , the so - called strmgren sphere .",
    "the evolution of the strmgren sphere is given by the following relation , @xcite @xmath140 where , @xmath141 is the proper volume of the strmgren sphere , and @xmath142^{-1}$ ] is the volume averaged recombination timescale @xcite .",
    "the proper radius @xmath143 , identifies a redshift interval @xmath144 between the emitter and the edge of the strmgren sphere , given by the following : @xmath145 though this equation is not strictly valid at @xmath146 , it is a good approximation at the high redshifts we are interested in ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "if @xmath148 is the redshift of the emitter , for redshifts lower than the strmgren sphere redshift , i.e. , @xmath149 , we use the @xmath35 value from @xcite . within the strmgren sphere , to @xmath129 we add the lae photoionization rate @xmath150 : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the specific ionizing luminosity of the emitter ( in erg s@xmath153@xmath153 ) , @xmath154 is the lyman limit wavelength ( 912  ) and @xmath155 is the hydrogen photoionization cross - section .",
    "thus , inside the ionized region , @xmath35 is computed as following : @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",
    "the solution must be chosen such that @xmath158 , which only happens for a negative sign before the square root . at the edge of the strmgren sphere",
    ", we force @xmath159 to attain the global value in the igm .",
    "the transmitted ly@xmath0 luminosity is @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the optical depth to ly@xmath0 photons . assuming that reionization completes at @xmath162 , @xmath161 can be calculated as @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the total absorption cross - section , @xmath165 and @xmath166 is the voigt profile .    for regions of low density ,",
    "the natural line broadening is not very important and the voigt profile can be approximated by the gaussian core : @xmath167 in eq.[gauss ] , @xmath168 $ ] is the local ly@xmath0 frequency at a distance @xmath169 from the emitter and @xmath170 .",
    "further , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the doppler width parameter , @xmath173 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath174 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath175 is the igm temperature @xcite .    for regions of high density , we take into account the lorentzian damping wing of the voigt profile .",
    "thus , for wavelengths outside the gaussian core , i.e. for @xmath176 , we assume the following profile @xcite : @xmath177 where @xmath178  s@xmath153 is the decay constant for the ly@xmath0 resonance .",
    "by using the model described in the previous section , we can compute the observed ly@xmath0 line profile : l_=e^-_l_^int = t_l_^int .",
    "the ly@xmath0 optical depth depends on three quantities : the star formation rate ( which fixes the value of @xmath94 ) , the ionized region radius , and the global neutral fraction : @xmath179 .",
    "once these three parameters are given , the transmissivity is uniquely determined .",
    "notice that @xmath180 .",
    "if instead we are interested in the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity , a fourth parameter needs to be specified , the  effective \" photon escape fraction @xmath181 which expresses the physical fact that the condition to observed ly@xmath0 photons is that some ionizing photons are absorbed within the galaxy and only a fraction @xmath103 of produced ly@xmath0 photons can escape to infinity .",
    "note that @xmath182 does not affect the transmissivity as both the intrinsic and the observed luminosity depend on it and therefore it factors out .",
    "a full exploration of the physical effects of the parameters on the observed luminosity , @xmath42 , can be performed by varying only the parameters @xmath183 and @xmath182 .",
    "the effects of other parameters ( as , for example , metallicity , @xmath125 ) can be estimated by simple scaling of the results below .    to understand the impact of each of the three relevant quantities on @xmath42 we have selected a _ fiducial _ case with parameters broadly similar to those we inferred under realistic ( i.e. observationally derived ) conditions for laes and allow them to vary in isolation taking three different values .",
    "we therefore considered @xmath184 different cases shown in fig.1 and summarized in detail in table 1 .",
    ".parameters of the fiducial model as well as for the different cases plotted in fig.[line_prof ] .",
    "for all cases , the halo mass is @xmath185 .",
    "dashes indicate that fiducial model values have been used . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as a sanity check , using the parameters that best fit the data as discussed in sec.[lf_fit ] , we calculate the contribution of laes to the sfr densities at @xmath186 and @xmath7 .",
    "we compare these with the sfr densities observed by @xcite ( table 2 ) for the common dust - correction case , the results for which are plotted in fig.[sfr_density ] .",
    "we find that for the best - fit parameters , the contribution of laes to the sfr density is redshift - dependent , being about 8% at @xmath6 with sfr in the range @xmath187 , and even higher at @xmath15 , although the data present a large scatter at the latter epoch .",
    "further , two points are worth noticing about the predicted sfr density .",
    "first , the sfr density must increase strongly from @xmath6 to @xmath7 in the lrm case .",
    "although not impossible , such behavior is certainly puzzling and not easy to interpret . as the dust formation timescale is about 10 myr , if the latter is copiously produced in supernova ejecta , as pointed out by several authors ( kozasa , hasegawa & nomoto 1991 , todini & ferrara 2001 , schneider , ferrara & salvaterra 2004 , bianchi & schneider 2007 ) and recently confirmed by the extinction curves of high redshift quasars ( maiolino et al .",
    "2004 ) , supernova - produced dust would rapidly increase the opacity to both continuum and photons , thus causing a rapid fading of the emitter .",
    "second , the contribution of laes is about 8% of the cosmic star formation rate density at @xmath6 .",
    "thus , either the duty cycle of the actively star forming phase in these objects is of the same order , or one has to admit that only a very small fraction ( @xmath188 ) of high redshift galaxies experience this evolutionary phase . in the first case ,",
    "the star formation duration would last about 8% of the hubble time at @xmath6 , i.e. 72 myr .      from our model",
    "it is easy to derive the intrinsic rest - frame line equivalent width$ ] where @xmath189$]@xmath190 and the specific continuum luminosity is given by @xmath191$]@xmath190@xmath153 .",
    "both the intrinsic ly@xmath0 and continuum luminosities have been derived using starburst99 ; we adopt @xmath95 and a kroupa imf ( for details , see sec .",
    "2.2 ) . ] . since both the continuum and @xmath105 scale linearly with sfr in our model ,",
    "the intrinsic ew distribution is a @xmath192-function at @xmath193 .    from our model , the observed ew in the rest frame of the emitter",
    "is calculated as @xmath194 where @xmath195 quantifies the fraction of the continuum luminosity which escapes the emitter , unabsorbed by dust .",
    "the ratio @xmath196 expresses the differential extinction of the line with respect to continuum radiation due to dust grains .    at @xmath15",
    ", we have seen that we require a factor @xmath197 4 suppression of the line luminosity by dust , i.e. @xmath198 . as dust affects also the continuum , and hence the ew , we need to estimate the value of @xmath195 ( calculated at @xmath199   ) .",
    "we find that @xmath200 for the mean ew from our model ( 155  ) to be the same as the observed ew ( 155  ) .",
    "we then use the following relations to obtain the color extinction : @xmath201 @xmath202 where @xmath203 and we have assumed a galactic extinction curve . from these expressions",
    "we obtain @xmath204 .",
    "the value of @xmath195 implies that the continuum is extincted about 1.6 times more heavily than the line ( assuming @xmath205 so that @xmath206 ) .",
    "this is not inconceivable if lae interstellar dust is inhomogenously distributed and/or clumped , as showed by neufeld ( 1991 ) . with these two values",
    "we then derive the predicted ew distribution and compare it with the dawson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) data in fig.[ewfig4.5 ] . as mentioned before , for the best fit parameters to the lf at @xmath15 , @xmath198 and @xmath207 .",
    "note that @xmath182 and particularly @xmath208 depend on the lae luminosity / mass and increase by about 45% and 20% respectively towards higher masses .",
    "the predicted ews are concentrated in a range , @xmath209 ( mean=@xmath210 ) , whereas the observed distribution is considerably wider , spanning the range @xmath211 with a mean of 155 . as explained above",
    ", the spread of the predicted ew distribution arises only from the corresponding spread of sfr ( 6 - 160 @xmath212 ) required in order to match the lf at @xmath15 , via the dependence of @xmath208 on the sfr .",
    "calculating the rest frame ews is easier at @xmath6 since we have an estimate of @xmath195 from the uv luminosity function as mentioned in tab[table2 ] .",
    "we calculate the ews using @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 . as for @xmath15 , @xmath182 and @xmath208",
    "depend on the halo mass and increase by 40% and 45% respectively towards higher masses .",
    "the calculations then yield ews that range between 56 - 127  .",
    "the mean from our model ( @xmath216  ) is much less than the mean value of 120  , observed by shimasaku et al . , 2006 .",
    "the narrow range ( z=4.5 ) and lower mean ( at z=5.7 ) of ews calculated from our model can easily be explained by the fact that our model does not include inflows / outflows , assumes an age of about 100 myr for all the emitters and a metallicity which is 1/20 of the solar value . in reality",
    ", a larger spread would be expected from the addition of physical effects lacking in this model , such as ( i ) gas kinematics ( inflow / outflow ) ; ( ii ) variations of the imf , metallicity , and stellar populations ( including popiii stars ) , and ( iii ) young stellar ages .",
    "while inflows erase the red part of the ly@xmath0 line , thereby reducing the ew , outflows shift the line centre redwards , helping more of it to escape .",
    "outflows can also add a bump to the red part of the line due to backscattering of ly@xmath0 photons , as shown by verhamme , schaerer & maselli , 2006 .",
    "a top heavy imf produces more ionizing photons , as does decreasing the metallicity .",
    "hence , both these effects increase the ew .",
    "further , for very young emitters ( @xmath217 myr ) , the continuum is much less than the continuum at 100 myr and so , the ew would be much larger for younger emitters .",
    "all these effects need a much more dedicated study , which we defer to future work .",
    "additional constraints on the model can come from the information embedded in the observed line profiles , as for example the line profile asymmetry . this can be suitably quantified by the _ weighted skewness _",
    "parameter , @xmath218 , introduced by @xcite , which we calculate for the best fit parameter values for the erm mentioned above .",
    "we adopt the following definition for such a quantity : @xmath219 where @xmath220 ( @xmath221 ) is the wavelength redward ( blueward ) of the ly@xmath0 line where the flux falls to 10% of the peak value .",
    "in addition , we have that @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the line flux in the wavelength pixel @xmath224 whose coordinate is @xmath225 , and the summations are performed over the pixels covered by the line . on general grounds one would expect that the observed line shape would be more symmetric ( i.e. low @xmath218 ) in reionization models characterized by a lower value of @xmath35 .",
    "however , given the above definition , just the opposite is true .",
    "in fact , for any reasonable value of the relevant parameters ( see fig.1 ) the blue part of the line is heavily absorbed , thus yielding a high value of @xmath218 ; as @xmath35 is increased , also the long - wavelength part of the line is affected by the red damping wing , making the line more symmetric around the peak .",
    "the predicted trend of @xmath218 with the observed luminosity at @xmath5 is reported in fig.[weighted_skewness ] , for the parameters of the erm and lrm that best fit the lf data ( discussed in the previous section ) .",
    "for both models , the weighted skewness of the line increases for more luminous objects ; however , such dependence is steeper for the erm than for the lrm . in general , though , the two reionization scenarios predict @xmath218 values in the range 10 - 17 . the data from kashikawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) spans the somewhat larger range 3 - 17 , with many of the data points lying around @xmath226 .",
    "given the paucity of the observed points and the large errors associated to them , it is probably premature to draw any strong claim from these results .",
    "however , given the constant increase in the amount and quality of lae data , it is quite possible that the line skewness could represent a very interesting tool to constrain reionization models in the near future .",
    "it has to be noted that the data show a large scatter of @xmath218 at a given value of @xmath42 , perhaps indicating that local conditions , including gas infall / outflow , density inhomogeneities and interaction of the ly@xmath0 line with the interstellar medium of the galaxy , might play a dominant role .",
    "these can only be investigated in a statistically meaningful manner via high - resolution numerical simulations to which we will defer a forthcoming study .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "it is instructive to summarize the response of the skewness to different physical conditions . as we have seen from fig.[weighted_skewness ]",
    ", @xmath218 increases with @xmath42 ( or , equivalently with sfr ) ; this is true for any fixed value of @xmath35 .",
    "this is because as the sfr increases , more of the ly@xmath0 line escapes forcing @xmath218 to increase as a result of the larger value of @xmath227 .",
    "further , the long -wavelength part of the observed ly@xmath0 line begins to flatten with increasing @xmath35 due to attenuation by the red damping wing .",
    "hence , @xmath227 varies slower with @xmath42 ( sfr ) for high @xmath35 ( lrm ) as compared to lower values ( erm ) ; this makes the slope of @xmath218 steeper for the erm .    a more general view of the dependence of @xmath218 on @xmath42 ( hence on sfr ) and @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "[ countour ] .",
    "the plot has been obtained by dividing the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity into bins and averaging the weighted skewness over the number of laes in each bin at a given value of @xmath35 .",
    "the regions with weighted skewness values equal to zero represent a lack of laes in that bin .",
    "the most intriguing feature of fig.[countour ] is a clear anti - correlation between @xmath42 and @xmath35 .",
    "given the range of sfr considered ( @xmath228yr@xmath153 ) , laes populate progressively fainter luminosity bins as the igm becomes more neutral .",
    "notice that relatively luminous objects ( @xmath229  erg  s@xmath153 ) would not be detected if @xmath230 . within the range in which these objects are visible",
    ", the most luminous objects always show the largest @xmath218 at fixed @xmath35 ; however , such maximum value is also seen to increase with decreasing @xmath35 .",
    "the model does not include important effects such as inflows / outflows and interaction of the ly@xmath0 photons with the ism , which will definitely leave an imprint on the @xmath218 and hence , weaken the @xmath42-@xmath35 anti - correlation .",
    "however , a composite ly@xmath0 line , built from the observations of a sufficiently large number of laes might show such an anti - correlation .",
    "in future work , we will endeavor to include these effects , hence obtaining an estimate of how large a sample might be sufficient for this purpose .",
    "starting from a simple yet physical model of galaxy formation within dark matter halos coupled with a population synthesis code , we have derived the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity for a lae .",
    "we then compute the volume of the ionized region built by the source and the density profile of the neutral hydrogen within it to obtain the damping of the emitted line caused by the gaussian core and lorentzian wings . using this semi - analytic model ,",
    "we have first explored the physical dependence of the observed ly@xmath0 line profile on various free parameters such as the lae star formation rate , ionized region radius , the effective escape fraction of photons and the global igm neutral hydrogen fraction . among other things",
    ", we pointed out the interesting fact that the observed luminosity , @xmath42 , peaks at a value of @xmath231 if the gas is substantially neutral ( @xmath232 ) ; for that value , the contribution of @xmath102 to the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity and the strmgren sphere balance each other .    by considering two physically motivated scenarios in which reionization occurs either early ( erm , @xmath1 ) or late ( lrm , @xmath233 )",
    "we have fixed the global value of the igm neutral fraction , @xmath35 ( thus leaving the star formation efficiency and the effective escape fraction of photons as the only free parameters ) , and obtained both the observed ly@xmath0 line profile and the ly@xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "finally we have compared these predictions with available data at various redshifts .    using this procedure",
    "we have been able to fit the lfs observed by dawson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and @xcite at @xmath15 , @xmath12 and @xmath7 respectively for the erm .",
    "according to this model , no redshift evolution or mass dependence of the star formation efficiency is required . on the contrary",
    ", the lrm requires an increase of a factor @xmath234 in the sfr efficiency from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "although not inconceivable , such an upturn of the star formation efficiency seems puzzling and at odds with the observed cosmic star formation rate density . on this basis , we are more inclined to support the erm . in addition , we find that the evolution of the observed luminosity function from @xmath6 to @xmath235 does not imply that we are scratching the reionization surface yet .",
    "rather , the lf evolution can be explained solely by the evolution of the underlying dark matter halo mass function between these redshifts , as has previously been discussed by dijkstra , wyithe & haiman , 2007 .",
    "one would however , require more observations of the sfr density and information regarding the boost added to the ionizing background due to clustering at @xmath236 to completely rule out the lrm",
    ".    a reasonable fit to the data at @xmath6 and @xmath5 is obtained for a single value of @xmath237 ( although a good fit is obtained by allowing for a ( 40% ) increase of @xmath182 towards larger masses ) .",
    "the data at @xmath15 instead pose a challenge to the model , as outlined earlier , because the observed number density of luminous objects is lower than that predicted by the evolution of the theoretical lf at higher redshifts .",
    "this could imply an increase in the overall dust content of laes at this redshift which would lead to absorption of ly@xmath0 photons within the emitter .",
    "such a clumpy dust component is also suggested by by the large ews observed at @xmath15 .",
    "we obtain the uv lf at @xmath6 and @xmath235 for the best fit values of @xmath238 for the erm .",
    "we find that additional damping of the uv luminosity is needed to match the predictions with the observations and quantify this by @xmath195 , the escape fraction of continuum photons .",
    "a single value of @xmath195 for a given redshift is enough to match the high luminosity end of the uv lf but does not produce the bending required at the faint end .",
    "this bending might just be the result of detection incompleteness of the sample .",
    "an interesting result is that for the given imf and metallicity , while at higher redshifts ( @xmath11 ) , the continuum photons are less absorbed by dust as compared to ly@xmath0 photons , this trend reverses at lower redshifts(@xmath239 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "this could be explained by imhomogenously distributed / clumped dust .",
    "however , the imf , ages and metallicies of the emitters must be fixed robustly using simulations and infall must be included in the model before such a strong claim can be made .    using the best fit value of @xmath240 and",
    "escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons ( continuum photons ) obtained for the erm from the ly@xmath0 ( uv ) lf , we calculate the expected ews at @xmath6 and find that the mean ( @xmath241 92  ) is much less than the observed value of 120  . at @xmath15 , since there are no observations of the uv lf at present , we calculate the escape fraction of continuum photons required to match the ew mean from the model to the data .",
    "a dust extinction of @xmath242 brings the predicted mean ews ( @xmath243   ) in very good agreement to the observed mean ( @xmath243   ) .",
    "this value of dust extinction is reasonable when compared to the observational upper limit of @xmath244 ( lai et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "however , additional effects which vary on a galaxy to galaxy basis , such as outflows / inflows or peculiar stellar populations are required to account for the spread of ew seen in the data .",
    "the contribution of laes to the cosmic sfr density is small , amounting to roughly 8% at @xmath6 .",
    "thus either the duty cycle of the actively star forming phase in these objects is of the same order , or one has to admit that only about one - twelfth of high redshift galaxies experience this evolutionary phase .",
    "additional useful information can be extracted from the line profile by using indicators like the line weighted skewness and equivalent width .",
    "the results presented here ( sections 4.4 - 4.5 ) must be considered as very preliminary for several reasons .",
    "first the available data on both @xmath218 and ew are very scarce and of relatively poor statistical quality , as they are very difficult to obtain even from the best current observations .",
    "second , our model contains a number of simplifications which make the comparison only meaningful at a basic level .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging that the model results are broadly in agreement with the data , at least for what concerns mean values .",
    "the models presented in this study do not include feedback processes related to the energy injection by supernovae . as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", peculiar gas motions might affect the line profile considerably : while inflows of gas erase the ly@xmath0 line , galaxy scale outflows produced by supernova ( or agn ) feedback enable more of the ly@xmath0 to escape . yet , our models are able to fit the lf evolution in the redshift range @xmath245 quite well .",
    "this might indicate that the effect of feedback might be similar for all the emitters in the halo mass range ( @xmath246 at @xmath5 ) .",
    "obviously , a more firm statement can be made only after a proper inclusion of peculiar motions .",
    "the backside of this is that , if inflows are taken into account , one can not constrain the value of @xmath35 robustly , as noted by @xcite .",
    "these effects can be properly taken care of by using high - resolution numerical simulations , which we plan to use in future works .    in the same spirit",
    ", a full study of the problem should also include the effects of igm density and temperature inhomogeneities , precise values of the local metallicity and star formation rates , and require information about the spatial clustering of the emitters .",
    "these values will be fixed in subsequent papers using the results of the simulation by @xcite .",
    "an even more cumbersome ingredient is represented by dust .",
    "dust grains act as sinks of and continuum photons , thus depressing the line luminosity but possibly boosting the line ew as explained throughout the paper .",
    "to what extent and on what timescales laes become dust - polluted ( and possibly enshrouded ) remains a question to which both theory and observations can provide only coarse answers at this time .",
    "our conclusions hint at the need for dust in order to explain the evolution of the lf toward the lowest redshift . however , lacking a precise knowledge of the mass dependence of the dust - to - gas ratios in high redshift galaxies and a deep understanding of the dust formation processes / sources , developing a fully consistent theory will keep us busy for many years to come .",
