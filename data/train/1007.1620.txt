    "methods for beating the standard quantum limit of radiation fields have become fairly standard .",
    "most methods are based on nonlinear interactions of the field in a highly nonlinear medium .",
    "the question of beating the quantum limit of the mechanical motion which could range from khz to ghz range is attracting increasing attention @xcite . fortunately a nano mechanical mirror [ nmo ] placed in an optical cavity interacts with the field in the cavity in nonlinear fashion and this can be described by a nonlinear hamiltonian . a scheme to beat the standard quantum limit for mechanical motion is to drive the system by a combination of a laser field and squeezed light such that the beat frequency matches the frequency of the nmo @xcite .",
    "more recently other designs of nmo have been used @xcite .",
    "these have certain attractive features and appear quite versatile ; for example , in the design of li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the nano waveguide interacts reactively with the microdisk resonator . in other words the fields leak from resonator to the waveguide .",
    "even though the coupling is of dissipative nature such a system exhibits several novel features such as normal mode splitting which traditionally was a feature of two strongly coupled oscillators described by the hamiltonian framework @xcite .    in this paper , we go one step further .",
    "we give first example of dissipative nonlinear coupling produced quantum fluctuations of the mechanical motion of the waveguide which are below the standard quantum limit .",
    "this is rather counterintuitive , as dissipation is always thought to produce negative effects , i.e. , is generally thought to suppress the quantum nature of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model , present the equation of motion for the system , and give the mean values of the system operators in steady state . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the quantum fluctuations in the mechanical motion of the waveguide and obtain the variance of momentum of the waveguide . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the numerical result and show that the reactive coupling can reduce the momentum fluctuations of the waveguide below the standard quantum limit .",
    "the numbers are rather attractive ; for example , at a temperature of 20 mk , achievable by a dilution refrigerator , the maximum momentum squeezing of the waveguide is about 60@xmath0 .",
    "let us consider a free - standing waveguide with length @xmath2 interacting with a microdisk resonator @xcite .",
    "suppose a laser with amplitude @xmath3 at frequency @xmath4 drives the resonator mode @xmath5 , and a quantum field @xmath6 at frequency @xmath7 is sent into the resonator through the waveguide with mass @xmath8 and frequency @xmath9 . for convenience ,",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the dimensionless position and momentum quadratures of the waveguide with @xmath12=2i$ ] .",
    "the waveguide vibrates along the @xmath13 direction due to the dispersive and reactive couplings with the resonator , which are characterized by the position dependence of the resonator resonance frequency @xmath14 and the photon decay rate @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the waveguide is damped at a rate of @xmath16 due to its interaction with its environment at a low temperature @xmath17 .    in a frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath4",
    ", the hamiltonian describing the whole system takes the form @xcite @xmath18c^{\\dag}c+\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_{m}}{4}(q^{2}+p^{2})+\\hbar\\frac { l}{c}\\tilde{n}_{g}\\omega_{l}\\varepsilon_{l}^2\\vspace{0.1in}\\\\\\hspace{0.3in}+i\\hbar\\sqrt{2\\kappa_{e}(q)}[\\varepsilon_{l}(c^{\\dag}-c)+c^{\\dag}c_{in}-c_{in}^{\\dag}c ] .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] where the first two terms describe the free energies of the resonator and the waveguide , respectively .",
    "the third term is the interaction between the waveguide and the laser , @xmath5 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath19 is the group index of the waveguide optical mode @xcite , and @xmath3 is related to the input power @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "the last term gives the interactions of the resonator with the laser and the quantum field .",
    "the characteristics of the quantum field would be specified later .    for a small displacement @xmath22",
    ", we can assume that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are coupled linearly to the displacement @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the resonator resonance frequency for @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the photon decay rate for @xmath25 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the dispersive and reactive coupling constants between the waveguide and the resonator , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath29 .",
    "since in the scheme of li _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite the effects of reactive coupling are dominant , we will take @xmath30 .    for simplicity",

    "we assumed that the quantum field @xmath6 had zero mean value .",
    "this would be the case generally unless the quantum field is a coherent field .",
    "we already examined the case of a coherent field in a previous publication @xcite .",
    "in this section , we investigate whether the motional quantum limit for the waveguide can be beaten even when the basic coupling is reactive",
    ". this would be quite counterintuitive as the dissipation generally leads to the loss of decoherence and fluctuations above the quantum limit .",
    "the fluctuations in @xmath41 and @xmath42 are subject to the heisenberg uncertainty relation . for the mechanical oscillator in ground state one",
    "has @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in which @xmath45 .",
    "thus the reduction of fluctuations below unity is an indication that the standard quantum limit is broken .",
    "the question is if the fluctuations in either @xmath22 or @xmath31 can go below the value unity .    since we are interested in the squeezing of the waveguide , it is instructive to calculate the fluctuations of the system s operators around their steady state values .",
    "provided that the steady - state amplitude of the resonator satisfies @xmath46 , we linearize eq .",

    "we start the investigation with the influence of the reactive coupling on the squeezing of the waveguide .",
    "if the quantum field is the ordinary vacuum ( @xmath95 ) , we calculate the variances of position and momentum , and find that @xmath96 and @xmath97 are always larger than unity , there is no squeezing appearance . if the quantum field is the squeezed vacuum , and @xmath98 , it has been found that there is no squeezing in the variance of position @xmath99 , but the variance of momentum @xmath84 may be squeezed . for pump power @xmath100 @xmath1w ,",

    "it is seen that the variance of momentum @xmath84 clearly exhibits the squeezing effect over a large range of pump power ( @xmath105 @xmath1w ) .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath97 is 0.243 at a very low pump power ( @xmath106 @xmath1w ) for @xmath102 mk , so the maximum momentum squeezing of the waveguide is about 75 @xmath0 . for @xmath107",
    "mk , the maximum momentum squeezing is about 60@xmath0 .",
    "note that temperatures like 20 mk are realizable by standard dilution refrigerators @xcite .",
    "we have shown that quantum squeezing effects in the motion of the waveguide can be generated solely due to the reactive coupling between the waveguide and the resonator by use of a squeezed vacuum .",
