    "combined vlba and tev observations of m87 reveal a rapidly varying tev emission that appears to be associated with the m.a.s vlba jet ( acciari et al .",
    "the rapid flaring activity of the tev source , with timescales @xmath4 day as low as 1 - 2 days , implies a source size of @xmath5 for a black hole mass @xmath6 solar masses .",
    "( macchettto et al . 1997 ) , recent modeling indicates @xmath7 ( gebhardt & thomas 2009 ) .",
    "for the following , a fiducial value of @xmath8 is adopted for m87 . ]    this , and the fact that the tev emission appears to be correlated with the vlba jet but not with emission from larger scales ( and in particular hst-1 ) , motivates the consideration that the observed tev photons originate from the black hole magnetosphere ( neronov & aharonian 2007 ; rieger & aharonian 2008 ) .",
    "a plausible magnetospheric process discussed in the literature is curvature and/or ic emission by particles , either hadrons or leptons , accelerating in a vacuum gap of a starved magnetosphere .",
    "an alternative explanation for the observed fast tev variability is emission from small regions located at larger radii , @xmath9 , as , e.g. , in the misaligned minijets model of giannios et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , or perhaps interaction of the jet with red giant stars closer to its base ( barkov et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the presence of the vlba jet implies that a force - free ( or ideal mhd ) flow is established on scales @xmath10 ( walker et al .",
    "2008 , acciari et al .",
    "2009 ) , so that the magnetosphere is anticipated to be screened in the sense that the invariant @xmath11 nearly vanishes everywhere .",
    "however , as in pulsar theory , there must be a plasma source that replenishes charges which escape the system ( both , to infinity and across the horizon ) along the open magnetic field lines in the polar region .",
    "the nature of this plasma source is poorly understood at present .",
    "the injection of charges into the magnetosphere may be associated with the accretion process .",
    "direct feeding seems unlikely , as charged particles would have to cross magnetic field lines on timescale shorter than the accretion time in order to reach the polar outflow .",
    "free neutrons that may be produced in a radiative inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) can cross field lines , however , they will decay over a distance @xmath12 for a @xmath13 black hole , and even if existent at sufficient quantity , will not reach the inner regions . on the other hand , mev photons that are emitted by the hot gas near the horizon can annihilate in the polar region to produce charged leptons .",
    "below , it is shown that the density of the charges thereby injected depends sensitively on the accretion rate and the conditions in the riaf .",
    "naive estimates suggest that in case of m87 this process can not provide complete screening at accretion rates that corresponds to the inferred jet power , and to a fit of the observed sed by an adaf model .",
    "those estimates are , however , highly uncertain , as explained below .",
    "another plausible plasma source is cascade formation in starved magnetospheric regions .",
    "the size of the gap then depends on the conditions in the magnetosphere and the pair production opacity . as shown elsewhere",
    "( levinson 2000 ) , vacuum breakdown by back - reaction is unlikely , as it requires magnetic field strength in excess of a few times @xmath14 g , higher than the equipartition value for eddington accretion .",
    "pair production via absorption of tev photons by the ambient radiation field is more likely .",
    "however , the spectrum of the vhe photons observed by h.e.s.s . extends up to @xmath15 tev ( e.g. , aharonian et al .",
    "2006 ) , and the assumption that these photons originate from the magnetosphere ( or even the vlba jet ) implies that the pair production opacity at these energies must not exceed unity .",
    "this raises the question whether pair cascades in the magnetosphere can at all account for the multiplicity required to establish a force - free flow .    in what follows",
    "it is shown that inverse compton scattering ( ic ) of ambient photons by electrons ( positrons ) accelerating in the gap can lead to a large multiplicity , @xmath1 , while still allowing photons at energies of up to a few tev to freely escape the system .",
    "the electromagnetic cascade is initiated by ic photons having much higher energies , up to @xmath16 tev , for which the @xmath17-optical depth is much larger .",
    "the seed charges are provided by annihilation of mev photons from the riaf .",
    "it is found that the gap width is not smaller than @xmath2 if the density of seed charges is below the goldreich - julian ( gj ) value .",
    "the luminosity of the vhe photons produced in the gap can account for the tev luminosity observed by h.e.s.s .",
    "any intermittencies of the cascade formation process would naturally lead to variability of both , the magnetospheric tev emission and the resultant force - free flow , as observed .",
    "a schematic illustration of the model is presented in figure [ fig : a ] .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in a black hole magnetosphere is limited by the rate at which matter is accreted into the black hole . at",
    "sufficiently low accretion rates the flow becomes radiative inefficient ( riaf ) and the electron temperature in the inner region of the riaf may exceed @xmath18 ( narayan & yi 1995 , hereafter ny95 ) .",
    "bremsstrahlung cooling then gives rise to emission of soft gamma - ray photons that annihilate in the magnetosphere , leading to injection of charges on open magnetic field lines .",
    "for sufficiently high annihilation rate the resultant charge density can exceed the gj value everywhere , keeping the magnetosphere force - free . at lower annihilation rates",
    "the magnetosphere will be starved . in the latter case",
    ", the charge density produced by the annihilating photons from the riaf defines the multiplicity required to establish a force - free outflow above the vacuum gap .    in what follows",
    "we give a crude estimate of the ratio of the charge density produced by the riaf and the gj density , assuming that the accreting gas is in equipartition ( @xmath19 ) with the magnetic field .",
    "henceforth , the accretion rate is measured in units of the eddington rate , @xmath20 , where the eddington accretion rate is defined as @xmath21 gr s@xmath22 , with @xmath23 adopted .",
    "the ion temperature of the accreted gas is close to virial , reaching @xmath24 k at @xmath25 .",
    "the ion density is given by @xmath26 adopting @xmath27 for the riaf radial velocity .",
    "the thompson optical depth is @xmath28 typically @xmath29 for accretion rates @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the critical rate below which riaf can exist .",
    "we assume that the equipartition magnetic pressure is half the gas pressure , viz .",
    ", @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the sound speed .",
    "this yields @xmath34 the numerical values in the expressions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 are in rough agreement with the results of ny95 for a viscosity parameter @xmath37 , adiabatic index of @xmath38 , and radiative efficiency @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the advection parameter , as defined in ny95 .",
    "at radii @xmath41 the electron - ion coupling becomes weak by virtue of rapid cooling . in this region electron cooling",
    "is dominated by synchrotron emission from thermal electrons . for accretion rates near the critical rate @xmath31 the electron temperature saturates at @xmath42 a few times @xmath43 k. at such temperatures",
    "only photons emitted by electrons at the tail of the thermal distribution have energies above the pair production threshold .",
    "however , for much lower accretion rates , @xmath30 , the electron temperature approaches @xmath44 k , and thermal photons can annihilate .    to estimate the annihilation rate at highly sub - critical accretion rates , we adopt the cooling functions for electron - ion and electron - electron bremsstrahlung , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , from ny95 . the total cooling rate per unit volume",
    "is then given to a good approximation by @xmath47 erg s@xmath22 @xmath48 at electron temperatures @xmath49 .",
    "the numerical value corresponds to the choice @xmath50 in the logarithmic term in eqs .",
    "( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 ) of ny95 .",
    "since the riaf is optically thin , pair production does not affect the leptonic content of the gas , and one can safely assume @xmath51 . by employing equation ( [ n_ion ] )",
    "one arrives at @xmath52 the free - free luminosity emitted by the riaf is @xmath53 , from which we readily obtain the number density of mev photons in the magnetosphere : @xmath54 where @xmath55 .",

    "this rate is balanced by the escape rate , roughly @xmath58 . equating the two rates one has @xmath59    the gj density",
    "can be related to the accretion rate @xmath60 through eq .",
    "( [ beq ] ) with @xmath25 : @xmath61 thus we obtain @xmath62 as seen , below a certain accretion rate , roughly @xmath63 , injection of charges by this mechanism can not provide complete screening of the magnetosphere .",
    "the ratio @xmath64 then defines the multiplicity required to produce a force - free flow . at higher accretion rates a vacuum gap may not exist .",
    "however , as noted above , the electron temperature decreases with increasing @xmath60 , eventually dropping below @xmath18 .",
    "detailed adaf calculations in kerr spacetime ( e.g. , manmoto , 2000 ; li et al .",
    "2009 ) indicate a cutoff in the emitted spectrum at around @xmath65 even for @xmath30 . for @xmath66 the number density of mev photons",
    "is suppressed by a factor of roughly @xmath67 , and @xmath68 by a factor of @xmath69 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "thus , there is an uncertainty of two to three orders of magnitudes in our estimate of the pair density @xmath70 .",
    "this large uncertainty and the strong dependence of charge injection on accretion rate motivates detailed self - consistent calculations .",
    "a complete , self - consistent treatment should also account for general relativistic effects , that are important close enough to the horizon .",

    "equations ( [ beq ] ) and ( [ n_ic ] ) with @xmath257 yield @xmath258 , from which we infer that multiplicity may be high enough to allow the pair density to approach the gj density if @xmath259 or so . for lower accretion rates we can safely assume @xmath260 .",
    "the present estimates of @xmath60 imply that a force - free flow can not be established by this mechanism .",
    "the gap will , nonetheless , emit gamma - rays with a total luminosity @xmath261 this emission is anticipated to peak in the sub - tev band , at @xmath262 gev .",
    "some fraction may be emitted also at much higher energies .",
    "annihilation of mev photons that are emitted by a radiative inefficient flow in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole leads to injection of charges into the black hole magnetosphere .",
    "the density of the injected charges depends sensitively on the accretion rate . at sufficiently large accretion rates",
    "the density may exceed the gj density , giving rise to a complete screening of the field aligned electric field , and the formation of a force - free outflow . at lower accretion rates complete screening",
    "can not be accomplished and a gap forms .",
    "the seed charges injected into the gap are quickly accelerated along magnetic field lines by the large potential drop generated by the rotating hole , until reaching a lorentz factor at which energy gain is balanced by curvature and inverse compton losses . the curvature and ic spectra peak in the tev band .",
    "the interaction of the tev photons thereby produced with the ambient radiation field may give rise to initiation of pair cascades , with a multiplicity that depends on the accretion rate .",
    "the proposed scenario is applicable to variable tev - emitting galactic nuclei that accrete at sufficiently low rates . out of the nearby under - luminous tev candidate sources ( sgr  a@xmath3 , cen  a , m87 , ngc  1399 ) , m87 and sgr  a@xmath3 are particularly interesting :    in case of m87 we estimate ( with a large uncertainty ) that annihilation of mev photons from the riaf can not provide complete screening for accretion rates that correspond to the inferred jet power , and to a fit of the observed sed by an adaf model .",
    "however , for a fully restored gap a large multiplicity , in excess of @xmath154 , is expected owing to absorption of @xmath263 tev photons that are produced through inverse compton emission of the charges accelerating in the gap .",
    "the pair production opacity decreases with decreasing gamma - ray energy , and becomes sufficiently small below @xmath244 tev to allow photons at these energies to freely escape the system .",
    "we propose that the variable tev emission detected by hess was emitted from a magnetospheric gap located at the base of the vlba jet .",
    "we note that rapid variability is naturally accounted for by this mechanism , as even moderate changes in accretion rate will lead to nonlinear fluctuations of the gap potential and the resultant tev emission , owing to the sensitive dependence of the density of injected charges on accretion rate .",
    "the observed gamma - ray spectrum should depend on the spectrum of soft ( scattered ) photons and the pair cascade process , and can , in fact , be quite broad . moreover , any spread in the curvature radius of magnetic field lines in the gap will lead to a spread in the maximum energy of accelerated pairs , which in turn broaden the spectrum further .",
    "detailed calculations are needed in order to determine the shape of the emitted gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "additional tev photons may be emitted by the jet on larger scales , but this component should be more steady",
    ". it can be useful to trace and disentangle the spectrum of the variable component alone .",
    "our analysis indicates that pair production alone would lead to a very high - sigma flow , which does nt seem to be supported by the observations .",
    "other processes , specifically magnetic field annihilation of a striped wind configuration by a rayleigh - taylor instability ( lyubarsky , 2010 ) , might give rise to additional pair creation during the acceleration phase of the outflow .",
    "this , however , would still imply asymptotic lorentz factor well in excess of that inferred from observations ( albeit on much larger scales ) .",
    "mass loading of the outflow may be accomplished through entrainment of surrounding matter , e.g. , due to a non - dipolar magnetic field ( mckinney & blandford , 2009 ) , or some instability of the wall jet interface .",
    "the resulting structure may consist of a fast ( high - sigma ) flow , surrounded by a slower sheath ( e.g. , levinson & eichler 1993 ) .",
    "the very inner magnetosphere may still support a vacuum gap if entrainment occurs on scales larger than several @xmath264 .",
    "the details of such putative structures remain to be explored .    in case of sgr a@xmath3",
    "we find that for current estimates of the accretion rate the density of pairs in the magnetosphere is likely to be below the gj value .",
    "gamma - ray emission from the gap is expected with a total luminosity that depends sensitively on accretion rate , eq .",
