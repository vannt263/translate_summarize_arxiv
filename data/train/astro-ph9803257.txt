    "the lyman alpha ( ly@xmath1 )  forest \" ( @xcite ; @xcite ) of spectral features caused by hi absorption along the line of sight to a quasar probes the state of the intergalactic medium over a wide range of physical conditions . during the past few years",
    ", high - precision observations made using the hires spectrograph ( @xcite ) on the 10 m keck telescope have quantified the statistics of these low column density absorbers to unprecedented accuracy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . during the same time span ,",
    "cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and photoionization have been able to reproduce many of the observed properties of quasar absorption spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rapid progress on theoretical and observational fronts has led to the emergence of a new paradigm for the origin of the high - redshift ( @xmath12 ) ly@xmath1  forest , in which most ly@xmath1  forest lines are produced by regions of low to moderate overdensity in hierarchically collapsing structures that are not in dynamical or thermal equilibrium .",
    "ly@xmath1  lines of lower column density generally arise in gas of lower physical density , which has a lower neutral hydrogen fraction because of the reduced recombination rate . in this paper , we use a matched comparison between a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation and a keck hires spectrum of the quasar q1422 + 231 to constrain the metal abundance of this low density gas .    the recent detection of metal lines associated with ly@xmath1  forest absorbers having column densities @xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; songaila & cowie 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) has provided a new avenue for investigating the ionization state and enrichment history of the high - redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "@xcite showed that 75% of ly@xmath1  absorbers with @xmath14 have associated civ absorption . using simple photoionization models they estimate that the mean metallicity of these absorbers is between [ c / h]@xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "studies that use cosmological simulations to model the density and temperature of the absorbing gas obtain a better match to the data for a mean metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath17 with around one dex of scatter , assuming either a power - law ionizing background ( @xcite ) or a reprocessed quasar ionizing background ( hellsten 1997 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "the question of how metals came to reside in these intermediate - density ly@xmath1  absorbers remains unanswered .",
    "since ly@xmath1  absorbers with @xmath18 are optically thin and associated with density peaks of overdensity @xmath19 , it is unlikely that they contain star - forming regions that produce _ in situ _ enrichment .",
    "thus some transport mechanism must be invoked to explain the presence of metals in these regions .",
    "one possibility is that the metals are ejected from nearby , forming galaxies , by some combination of supernova blowout ( @xcite ) and tidal stripping ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the enriching proto - galaxies are likely to form more efficiently in high density environments , these scenarios predict a significant correlation between metallicity and density ( see , e.g. , figure  6 of gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , the igm may have been enriched at a very early epoch by more ubiquitous population iii objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in which case all ly@xmath1  absorbers might be expected to have roughly the same metallicity . because civ lines probe only a small range of hi column densities ( and hence physical densities ) with adequate statistics , it is difficult to distinguish between these enrichment models using only civ data .",
    "metal abundances can be studied at higher densities in lyman limit systems ( @xmath20 ) and damped ly@xmath1  systems ( @xmath21 ) , but these are objects where _ in situ _ enrichment is likely and where ( especially for lyman limit systems ) uncertain radiative transfer effects complicate the inference of metal abundances from line strengths .    in this paper , we attempt to extend metallicity constraints to the low column density ( @xmath4 ) , and hence low physical density , ly@xmath1  forest .",
    "carbon is difficult to detect in this regime because the low density reduces @xmath22 and ionizes more civ to cv .",
    "however , @xcite have used composite spectra to attempt to detect civ in such systems , and we briefly discuss their results in  [ sec : disc ] . in this paper",
    ", we focus instead on ovi , which is expected to be the one detectable metal absorption feature tracing ly@xmath1  absorbers with @xmath4 because of its high ionization state and large oscillator strength ( hellsten 1998 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty with this approach , and the reason that it has not been previously attempted , is that the ovi absorption features lie embedded within the ly@xmath1  forest , which is quite crowded at these redshifts .",
    "we overcome this problem by using a line identification scheme specifically designed to select candidate ovi features and by using artificial spectra extracted from a realistic cosmological simulation to calibrate the efficiency of ovi detection and the contamination from narrow ly@xmath1  lines . with these procedures",
    ", we can test whether the low density regions of the ly@xmath1  forest are consistent with a uniform metallicity extrapolated from the civ data at higher densities .",
    "the low density igm is highly photoionized by the metagalactic ultraviolet ( uv ) background . for our standard spectral shape ,",
    "we assume that the uv background is produced by quasar emission reprocessed by ly@xmath1  forest absorption ( haardt & madau 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "we find that if the igm metallicity is uniform at [ c / h]@xmath17 , the uv background has the spectral shape given by @xcite , and oxygen has the factor of three overabundance ( relative to solar ) predicted by type ii supernova enrichment models , then ovi should be readily detectable in the spectrum of q1422 + 231 .",
    "however , our detection algorithm finds very few candidate ovi lines in the spectrum .",
    "the absence of detectable ovi features has several possible interpretations : ( 1 ) oxygen is not overabundant relative to carbon in the low density igm , ( 2 ) the metallicity of low density regions as traced by @xmath4 ly@xmath1  absorption systems is lower than the metallicity of intermediate - density regions traced by higher column density absorption , or ( 3 ) there are many fewer high - energy photons capable of photoionizing ov to ovi than are predicted by the @xcite ionizing background .    to distinguish between these interpretations , we apply a second algorithm , the optical depth ratio technique of songaila ( 1998 , hereafter @xcite ) designed to detect ovi in regions where significant civ absorption is found .",
    "since we have independently determined [ c / h ] in these regions , we can use this technique to discriminate between different ionization conditions and abundance patterns . by applying this technique to the spectrum of q1422 + 231 and calibrating the results using artificial spectra , we find that : ( 1 ) a significant metallicity gradient ( declining metallicity with declining density ) must exist regardless of whether helium has mostly reionized or not , ( 2 ) if helium has reionized by @xmath23 , our results are consistent with [ o / c ]  @xmath24 , and ( 3 ) if the epoch of helium reionization does not begin until @xmath25 , a highly implausible oxygen overabundance of [ o / c ]  @xmath26 is required .",
    "combining the results from these two analysis techniques , our favored scenario for the low density igm at @xmath27 is one in which more than half of the volume of the universe has helium predominantly reionized by @xmath23 , oxygen is overabundant relative to carbon by a factor @xmath28 , and spatial regions with overdensities @xmath29 have an average metallicity _ at least _ a factor of 3 higher than regions near the mean baryonic density .",

    "we perform a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a @xmath5-dominated cold dark matter ( lcdm ) model with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , inflationary spectral index @xmath35 , and rms fluctuation amplitude @xmath36 .",
    "these values yield a cobe - normalized lcdm model that is in agreement with most current observational constraints ( @xcite ) .",
    "we chose the lcdm model because it reproduces the characteristics of the ly@xmath1  forest of q1422 + 231 most closely ( dav , in preparation ) , although the differences from other popular cosmologies are slight .",
    "we choose the value of the baryon density @xmath37 to match recent observations of the deuterium abundance that give @xmath38 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . matching the observed mean transmission in the ly@xmath1  forest using reasonable estimates for the intensity of the metagalactic photoionizing background",
    "also requires a baryon abundance of this order ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations were performed using ptreesph ( @xcite ) , a version of the treesph code ( @xcite ; @xcite ) implemented on massively parallel supercomputers .",
    "we use @xmath39 dark matter particles and @xmath39 gas particles in a periodic cube 11.111@xmath40  comoving mpc on a side and a gravitational softening length of 3@xmath40  comoving kpc ( equivalent plummer softening ) .",
    "the masses of the dark matter and gas particles are @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the initial fluctuations are a gaussian random field with the power spectrum computed using the hu & sugiyama ( 1996 ) formulation of the cdm transfer function .",
    "we include radiative cooling for primordial composition gas and photoionization and heating from a spatially uniform uv background .",
    "we adopt the uv spectral shape and intensity ( versus redshift ) from @xcite , with the exception that the intrinsic quasar spectrum has been softened from a power law index of @xmath43 to @xmath44 , as is now favored by those authors ( madau , private communication ) ; we shall still refer to this as the @xcite spectrum .",
    "we compute the relative abundances of ionic species assuming equilibrium between ionization and recombination ( see @xcite ) ; we will examine possible effects of this assumption in  [ sec : hot ] .",
    "we include a prescription for star formation , but for the results contained in this paper , this has no significant effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "we ran from a starting redshift of @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "this simulation took roughly 3400 node - hours on 16 processors of the cray t3e at the pittsburgh supercomputing center .",
    "in this paper we will be comparing our simulations to only one quasar spectrum , that of q1422 + 231 ( shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : qspec ] ) , since that is the only one currently available to us .",
    "it was generously provided to us by a.  songaila and l.  cowie , and their observations of q1422 using keck s hires spectrograph are described more fully in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly note that the quasar emission redshift is @xmath0 , and the spectral resolution ( as provided to us ) is 0.06 , corresponding to roughly @xmath47 per pixel from 3900   to 7200 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio is roughly @xmath48 per pixel in the region of ly@xmath49  and ovi absorption ( @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 per pixel in the pure ly@xmath1  forest region , and over 100 per pixel in the metal line region redwards of the ly@xmath1  emission peak . due to a lyman limit system at @xmath52 ,",
    "the spectrum of q1422 effectively truncates around 4000 .",
    "thus @xmath5340004800   represents the usable region for our ovi search , corresponding to @xmath54 , with poorer sensitivity towards lower redshifts because of the dropping intrinsic flux of the quasar and the degrading response of hires towards the blue .      to model q1422 as closely as possible , we have developed a new method for generating artificial quasar spectra from a cosmological simulation .",
    "our approach produces continuous line - of - sight artificial spectra between two desired wavelengths , analogous to real quasar spectra , rather than a large number of small , disjoint spectra at a single redshift as has been typically done in other studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the advantages of these _ continuous artificial spectra _ are that they automatically include the redshift evolution intrinsic to any given model and that the similarity between the artificial spectra and the real quasar spectrum allows the identical analysis routines to be applied to both .",
    "this reduces the algorithm - dependent variations of continuum fitting , noise estimation , and most importantly for this work , metal line identification .",
    "generating continuous spectra requires that particle information be output at frequent intervals during a simulation .",
    "since we can not output all the simulation data every few timesteps owing to disk space and i / o time constraints , we output only the particle information required to generate the desired spectra .",
    "we choose the frequency of output data so that the redshift interval between outputs exactly equals the length of the box in redshift space , given by @xmath55 l,\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath57 , @xmath58 is the hubble constant today , @xmath59 is the simulation size in comoving @xmath40mpc , and @xmath60 is the speed of light . at each output timestep during the simulation run , we choose six random lines of sight from within the volume .",
    "we output information ( @xmath61 ) for all gas particles whose sph smoothing volume ( i.e. , the region of space a gas particle represents ) intersects one of these lines of sight . at each output , a new set of six lines of sight is randomly chosen .",
    "we begin outputting spectra continuously at @xmath62 ; roughly 100 outputs are required to @xmath46 .",
    "we use this particle information together with the assumed ionizing background interpolated to the output redshift to generate optical depths along these lines of sight for the following ions : hi , hei , heii , civ , cii , siiv , nv , and ovi .",
    "we use cloudy 90 ( @xcite ) to compute lookup tables for the fraction of gas in each ionization state at a given density and temperature for our adopted @xmath63 , accounting for both photoionization and collisional ionization , and we use routines extracted from the tipsy package ( @xcite ) to compute smoothed gas properties along each line of sight ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "we assume that the gas is optically thin , which is appropriate for the ly@xmath1  forest regime .",
    "we compute the profiles of optical depth versus observed wavelength ( or , equivalently , versus redshift ) individually for each output box , then join the contiguous output boxes to produce continuous spectra for redshifts below @xmath62 along each of the six lines of sight .",
    "when producing these continuous spectra , we have to pay special attention to the regions where the spectra from contiguous output boxes are joined , because the physical properties there are discontinuous . since the simulation volume is periodic , we can arbitrarily shift the particle positions , and hence the computed optical depths , in a periodic sense within a single output box .",
    "we shift the optical depths so that the point of lowest hi absorption lies at the ends of the spectra at any given output .",
    "thus we join the spectra in regions of very low optical depth , which for our purposes are uninteresting ; they also arise from voids that have relatively smooth and homogeneous physical properties .",
    "we smooth these transition regions over a small interval of five pixels out of a total of 1000 output pixels ( where one pixel in our artificial spectrum corresponds to @xmath64 at these redshifts ) .    with a list of optical depths versus redshift for various ions",
    ", we are now equipped to produce artificial quasar spectra .",
    "we select a quasar spectrum to simulate ( in our case q1422 ) , specifying its redshift , the wavelength interval over which we wish to produce a spectrum , its resolution in wavelength space , and a spatially uniform metallicity .",
    "we assume an abundance pattern typical of low - metallicity stars and hii regions , presumably enriched by type ii supernovae : @xmath65  [ fe / h ]  =  [ c / h ] , [ n / c ]  @xmath66 , [ si / c ]  @xmath67 , and [ o / c ]  @xmath68 ; we discuss these ratios further in  [ sec : o / c ] . in each wavelength bin",
    ", we sum the contribution to the optical depth from all ions with redshifts lower than the quasar redshift .",
    "we consider the entire lyman series up to ly-30 , and both doublet components for the metal species .",
    "this procedure yields a list of `` observed '' optical depths versus wavelength at the specified spectral resolution .",
    "we now add noise and fit a continuum to each artificial spectrum .",
    "although we know the true location of the continuum in advance , it is important to perform a continuum fit to maintain equivalence between the procedures for analyzing observed and artificial spectra .",
    "we have developed automated routines for estimating the signal - to - noise ratio on a pixel - by - pixel basis and fitting a continuum to raw quasar data .",
    "we estimate the noise by first identifying small regions of saturation and measuring the average detector noise , and then finding regions of  continuum \" to estimate the average noise from photon statistics , within 30   segments of the spectrum . in the dense ly@xmath1",
    "forest it is difficult to find sizable regions where the flux is near the continuum , so typically the shot noise is somewhat overestimated because it includes a contribution from fluctuating low level absorption .",
    "we have not corrected for this effect . nevertheless , our noise estimates agree reasonably well with those of @xcite .",
    "we estimate the continuum by fitting smoothed second - order polynomials to the spectral peaks in 30   intervals .",
    "while this may appear crude , no method can recover the true continuum because even in the artificial spectra the flux rarely approaches the true continuum level for @xmath27 .",
    "thus we strive only to implement a method that can be applied identically to the real and artificial spectra , is similar to methods traditionally used in observational analyses , and uses a low order fitting function in order to minimize `` overfitting '' of true absorption fluctuations . because our ovi search below is based on identification of narrow isolated absorption features , the details of continuum fitting are not critical for our current purposes .",
    "we estimate the continuum and noise characteristics of q1422 using the above algorithms . to incorporate noise into the artificial spectra",
    ", we take the detector noise and shot noise as estimated in the observed spectra and add it directly ( with a gaussian random distribution ) to the intensity of the artificial spectra , giving the artificial spectra very similar noise characteristics to the observed spectra .",
    "we continuum fit the artificial spectra , and the resulting data are output as a single artificial quasar spectrum",
    ".    the intensity of the metagalactic photoionizing background ( @xmath63 ) is not tightly constrained by current observations .",
    "we use the intensity predicted by @xcite when evolving the simulation , but because @xmath63 does not significantly affect the dynamics in the optically thin , low - to - moderate overdensity regions , we can vary the intensity of @xmath63 _ a posteriori _ to desired levels and obtain nearly identical results to having redone the entire simulation with that @xmath63 ( @xcite ) . to constrain @xmath63 , we note that the mean opacity @xmath69 of the ly@xmath1  forest depends on the parameter combination @xmath70 , since the hi optical depths are proportional to this combination ( for fixed gas temperature ) . after obtaining a noise - added , continuum - fitted artificial spectrum ,",
    "we measure its mean transmission , then use that information to adjust @xmath63 , and repeat the above procedure to produce a new quasar spectrum .",
    "we typically iterate several times until the mean transmission converges to within 1% of the observed mean transmission for q1422 ; this corresponds to a determination of @xmath63 to better than 2% ( given our adopted @xmath37 ) .",
    "we perform this process individually for each artificial quasar spectrum . for our lcdm model ,",
    "the average factor by which the @xcite intensity must be increased is @xmath71 , where the variance is computed over the six artificial spectra . as a side note ,",
    "the implied value of @xmath37 for consistency with the @xcite intensity itself is @xmath72 for this model .",
    "once we have an intensity of @xmath63 for each artificial spectrum , we now recalculate the metal species optical depths using this new intensity , because unlike hi absorption , metal absorption does not scale in a trivial way with @xmath63 .",
    "once we calculate the new optical depths , we again fit a continuum and add noise in the manner described above .",
    "therefore , each artificial spectrum has the correct hi mean transmission , and the metal absorption is computed assuming a spatially uniform metallicity and ionizing background with the @xcite shape and an intensity constrained by the mean transmission of q1422 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : qspec ] ( left panels ) we show the spectrum of q1422 ( reproduced from @xcite ) and an example of one of our six artificial spectra for q1422 with metallicity @xmath73 , with the corresponding continuum fit and noise level ( multiplied by four for visibility ) in the ly@xmath1  forest region .",
    "the differences between these two spectra are due to : ( 1 ) emission features in the quasar not present in the artificial spectra , ( 2 ) the downward slope of the observed continuum in the ly@xmath1  forest of q1422 caused by the intrinsically varying spectral intensity of the quasar and the declining response of the hires spectrograph towards the blue , and ( 3 ) the intrinsic fluctuations in the continuum level of q1422 .",
    "these features in q1422 are subsequently normalized out by fitting a continuum level to the peaks , as shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : qspec ] ; the identical continuum fitting routine is applied to the artificial spectrum for consistency . after this procedure",
    ", the artificial spectrum contains all the significant characteristics of the q1422 spectrum , as shown in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : qspec ] .",
    "we also fit a continuum to the spectra redwards of the ly@xmath1  peak ; this procedure is much more robust since there are plenty of regions of virtually unabsorbed continuum .",
    "there are some features of real quasar spectra that are not reproduced in these continuous artificial spectra , although we expect that these differences will not significantly affect our results .",
    "first , correlations of lines across the boundaries where the segmented spectra have been joined are not properly reproduced ; thus caution must be taken when using these spectra to measure line - of - sight correlation functions . in this paper",
    ", we are counting and measuring only isolated lines , so this problem does not arise .",
    "second , metal line absorption from systems at low redshift is not properly taken into account , since our artificial spectra stop at @xmath46 . in practice ,",
    "the influence of interloping metal lines on the mean transmission in the ly@xmath1  forest region is extremely small , so our determination of @xmath63 is virtually unaffected .",
    "third , real spectra have intrinsic small - scale variations in their noise level , e.g. , owing to a fluctuating response across an echelle order .",
    "the noise level of the artificial spectra is constant over a @xmath74   scale , so these small - scale fluctuations are not reproduced .",
    "we do not expect this to have a significant effect on our conclusions , but in future work we will model some of these effects in greater detail .",
    "previous searches for ovi absorption at high redshifts have had very limited success .",
    "the only claimed detection of an ovi line at @xmath75 is by kirkman & tytler ( 1997 ; hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "they found a single narrow feature in q1422 which they identified as ovi primarily on the basis of associated civ absorption .",
    "the doublet companion was subsumed by an hi line .",
    "the method of searching for ovi associated with civ is taken from low - redshift studies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , given a universe with a homogeneous metallicity and an ionizing background shape similar to that predicted by @xcite , this strategy is not the optimal way to find ovi .",
    "the reason for this is illustrated by the line observability index ( lox ) plot in figure  [ fig : lox ] .",
    "the lox is described more fully in @xcite ; here we outline the relevant features .",
    "the lox is calculated using the density - temperature relation taken from a balance between cosmic expansion and photoionization heating , which predicts @xmath76 , and the peak density - column density relation computed from artificial spectra , @xmath77 using these relations , a given hi column density can be associated with a particular ionization condition , from which the fraction in any ionization state can be calculated using cloudy 90 ( @xcite ) . combined with an assumed ( uniform ) metallicity , here taken to be @xmath78 solar for civ and @xmath79 solar for ovi , this analysis predicts a rest equivalent width @xmath80 for a typical absorption line of a given species . by the appropriate choice of additive constants ( see @xcite ) , the lox is given by @xmath81 where the equation is exact in the limit of weak lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : lox ] shows the lox of ovi and civ given the @xcite spectrum ( solid curves ) .",
    "the horizontal dot - dashed line corresponds roughly to the detectability limit in the ly@xmath1  forest of q1422 , while the horizontal dotted line reflects the detectability limit redwards of the ly@xmath1  emission peak .",
    "the dashed curves will be addressed in  [ sec : cut ] .",
    "this figure is similar to figures  35 of @xcite except that the lox is now calculated for the lcdm model used in this paper , which has a higher baryon fraction .",
    "the impact of the higher @xmath37 is minimal , as @xcite predicted it would be .",
    "as stated in @xcite , given the assumed metallicity and ionization state , civ will be observable in lines with hi column densities @xmath82 , while ovi will be observable to significantly lower hi column densities , down to almost @xmath83 ( if the ovi line is not subsumed by an hi line ) . since the column density distribution @xmath84 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , there are many more hi lines at lower column densities .",
    "this means that in any given quasar spectrum , if the metallicity is uniform across all hi column densities , photoionized ovi should be associated with hi lines that often have no associated civ absorption .",
    "we demonstrate this point more quantitatively in ",
    "[ sec : nhist ] below .",
    "@xcite claimed that the ovi detected in their @xmath52 lyman limit system in q1422 must be collisionally ionized , in part by arguing that few high - energy photons capable of ionizing oxygen to ovi would exist far from quasars .",
    "they argued that while @xcite assumed uniform emissivity of quasars , in reality quasars are discrete sources , and far from quasars there should be further softening of the radiation field due to reprocessing by ambient heii .",
    "they calculated the mean free path of heii - ionizing ( 4  ry ) photons to be roughly @xmath85mpc , and from this value obtained a volume filling factor of only 2% .    while valid for heii , the extension of this argument to ovi is less certain",
    ". photons capable of ionizing ov to ovi require energies greater than 114  ev  @xmath86  8.4  ry . since the cross section of absorption scales as @xmath87 , the mean free path of an ov ionizing photon",
    "is @xmath88 times that of an heii ionizing photon . given this additional factor of about 1000 in volume , a universe with the observed distribution of quasars and a @xcite ionizing background",
    "will effectively be transparent to ov - ionizing photons .",
    "this does not imply that the ovi absorption system detected by @xcite is necessarily photoionized  it is associated with a high column density hi absorber that might well be embedded in a collapsed gas halo hot enough to cause collisional ionization . nevertheless , while our assumption of a uniform ionizing background may be an oversimplification",
    ", we do not expect that its spectrum should have _ systematically _ fewer ov - ionizing photons than predicted by @xcite , provided that most heii has been reionized to heiii by the redshift in question .",
    "in @xcite we analyzed civ artificial spectra in a manner similar to @xcite s procedure , allowing a direct comparison with @xcite s results .",
    "however , the artificial spectra used were of the  segment spectra \" variety , , many small intervals of spectra at particular redshifts , and the detailed modeling of q1422 was not as sophisticated as we do here . in this section ,",
    "we describe a reanalysis of civ absorption in q1422 , alongside an analysis of civ in our continuous artificial spectra .",
    "the main additional ingredient is that we now identify and fit civ and hi absorption features in the artificial spectra and q1422 using the same routines",
    ". nevertheless , the basic results are similar to those of @xcite .    the automated voigt profile fitter autovp ( @xcite ) has been extended to identify and fit metal line doublets lying outside the ly@xmath1  forest , such as civ .",
    "once a spectrum has been fitted with ly@xmath1  lines , the identification scheme searches for spectral features in the ly@xmath1  forest region where the intensity drops below some threshold , taken to be 0.7 . within the wavelength interval where the intensity is below that threshold , autovp searches for associated civ absorption in the two regions corresponding to the doublet positions . if an absorption feature is due to civ , it should be present in both regions , with the strong component region ( 1548 ) having twice the optical depth of the weak component region ( 1551 ) because of the difference in oscillator strengths . to identify any absorption that could possibly be civ , autovp doubles the optical depths of each pixel in the weak component region , superimposes them on the strong line region with an appropriate shift in wavelength , then takes the smaller of the two optical depths ( strong component or double the weak component ) as its measure of civ absorption .",
    "since civ is the dominant species of absorption redwards of the ly@xmath1  emission peak , the implicit assumption that all absorption identified in this way is civ turns out to be quite good .",
    "we then fit this remaining absorption with civ voigt profiles , and sum the column densities within the region .",
    "the associated hi column density is found by summing all column densities of hi lines within the associated spectral region . since the ly@xmath1  feature is typically saturated and therefore yields an inaccurate estimate of the hi column density , autovp searches down the lyman series until it finds the first non - saturated lyman series region , or alternatively the last observable lyman series region before the blue cutoff in the spectrum ; this is the hi line which is fit . wherever possible ,",
    "the unsaturated regions of other lyman series lines ( except ly@xmath1  ) are converted to optical depths , and used to constrain the optical depth at the associated position in the fitted lyman series line region ; this minimizes the contribution due to coincident absorption from other lyman series lines .",
    "after this constraint has been applied , the lyman series region is fit with voigt profiles to obtain the hi column density .",
    "often each region has several hi and civ lines ; we do not attempt to associate individual civ lines with hi lines , as varying ionization conditions and bulk motions can make this identification very confusing and produce unphysical results .",
    "our procedure is similar to that of @xcite , although they fit all lyman series lines simultaneously to obtain the hi column density . in any case , we apply the exact same detection and measurement algorithm to q1422 and the artificial spectra , so whatever biases are introduced will be similar in both data sets .",

    "note that the cosmological model and @xmath37 value used for our simulations are substantially different from those used by @xcite , demonstrating the overall lack of sensitivity of the mean metallicity determination to these assumptions .",
    "we now turn our attention to the question of whether this metallicity distribution is consistent with observations of ovi absorption .",
    "coincident hi absorption complicates the detection of ovi(1032,1037 ) lines in quasar spectra . for q1422 ,",
    "ovi is detectable only below about 4800 , lying in a region with a high density of ly@xmath1  ( 1216 ) and ly@xmath49  ( 1026 ) absorbers .",
    "ovi lines are expected to be narrower than hi lines because thermal broadening is a factor of four lower . however , as one goes to lower density structures , broadening by residual hubble flow across the absorbing region becomes progressively more important ( @xcite ) , making ovi lines broader than naively predicted by thermal broadening .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the distribution of ovi line widths will have a tail to smaller @xmath94-parameter ( i.e. , gaussian velocity width ) than hi line widths .",
    "since our goal is to distinguish ovi absorption from hi absorption rather than to identify all possible ovi features , we focus on this tail of narrow ovi lines in our detection algorithm .    figure  [ fig : auto5 ] shows a comparison between a roughly 100  segment in one of our continuous artificial spectra versus the spectrum of q1422 .",
    "the top panel shows an artificial spectrum in the same wavelength range without any metals added ( i.e. , only lyman series absorption ) .",
    "the second panel shows the absorption caused purely by ovi , including both doublet lines .",
    "the third panel shows the artificial spectrum with a metallicity of [ c / h]@xmath89 and [ o / c ]  @xmath68 , essentially corresponding to the optical depth sum of the first and second panels , since no other ions contribute significantly in this wavelength range",

    "the noisy lines represent the data ; the smooth curves will be explained below .    from the third panel of figure  [ fig : auto5 ]",
    "it is apparent that some narrow features from ovi do survive despite the blanketing by hi .",
    "we tried a variety of algorithms to quantify the presence of these additional narrow features .",
    "the standard technique of decomposing the full spectrum into a superposition of voigt profiles ( which are effectively just gaussian optical depth profiles in this low column density regime ) proved ineffective .",
    "many of the hi features are intrinsically asymmetric , and in voigt profile decomposition narrow components are often introduced to fit the wings of these asymmetric lines .",
    "it is therefore more useful to focus on _ isolated _ narrow lines .    as an alternative to voigt profile decomposition",
    ", we developed a much simpler algorithm that searches for spectral features that dip by more than @xmath95 and then return to their original level all within a very small velocity interval , @xmath96 ( 45 pixels ) .",
    "the @xmath95 criterion eliminates noise spikes , while the velocity range criterion is tuned to optimally select out the tail of narrow ovi lines that we would like to identify .",
    "we call this procedure our _ narrow line detection algorithm_. after identifying the narrow feature , we fit it using a voigt profile to obtain its column density and @xmath94-parameter . the identification and fits are shown as the smooth curves in figure  [ fig : auto5 ] .",
    "as can be seen there , this algorithm effectively picks out many of the narrow ovi features that survive hi blanketing .",
    "occasionally , narrow lines are detected in the spectrum even without any metals ( top panel of figure  [ fig : auto5 ] ) .",
    "these narrow lines arise primarily at velocity caustics , which produce hi lines whose widths are close to those expected from thermal broadening",

    "we count the number of narrow lines detected .",
    "for q1422 , we detect 11 narrow lines , while in the zero - metallicity case we detect an average of around seven per artificial spectrum .",

    "owing to the high density of hi lines with @xmath110 , this is an inexact procedure , as it is difficult to associate a single hi feature with a given ovi line ( even more so than in the case of civ ) .",

    "the theoretical motivation for oxygen overabundance is the assumption that early star formation produced enrichment patterns characteristic of type ii supernova yields , which have enhanced representation of @xmath1-process elements .",
    "high redshift enrichment almost certainly relies on type ii supernovae ; in a blowout model , both energetic and time constraints require type ii supernovae ( @xcite ) , while in a tidal stripping model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , there is insufficient time to produce a large number of type i supernovae .",
    "direct evidence for type ii enrichment patterns in the early universe comes from local halo stars , which show an overabundance of oxygen relative to carbon of 35 ( @xcite ) , and there is evidence that the very earliest stars are even more overabundant in @xmath1-process elements ( @xcite )",
    ". there is also mounting evidence for type ii enrichment patterns at high redshift in forming galaxies ( @xcite ) and in damped ly@xmath1  absorbers ( @xcite ) .",

    "we have also assumed a uniform metallicity . from the civ data ,",
    "one sees that at least some spatial scatter in metallicity is likely .",
    "such a scatter applied to the simulations would serve to _ strengthen _ our conclusions , because it would tend to increase the number of ovi systems in the strong - absorption tail of the distribution , and these stronger lines are more likely to be detected despite coincident hi absorption . for spatial variations in the ionizing background ,",
    "the situation is more complex , but a similar argument is still probably valid as long as there is no systematic softening of the ionizing background above 114  ev .",
    "our simulation assumed ionization equilibrium ( balance between recombination and ionization rates ) at all times when computing ionic abundances .",
    "departures from equilibrium abundances can , under some circumstances , allow substantial heating of the igm during the reionization epoch ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low density gas that produces the ly@xmath1  forest loses energy mainly from adiabatic expansion , so the cooling timescale is comparable to the hubble time .",
    "the relation between gas temperature and density in the igm therefore depends on the assumed reionization epoch and associated heat injection ( @xcite ) .",
    "our equilibrium abundance approach yields the temperature - density relation that arises for minimal heating or a high reionization redshift .",
    "the higher temperatures that arise in plausible alternative reionization scenarios could in principle have a significant effect on our ovi modeling because the ionization fractions are sensitive to temperature .",
    "one example of the effect of different reionization assumptions appears in figure  7 of rauch et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , which shows the difference in the density - temperature relation between a simulation run assuming ionization equilibrium ( @xcite ) and a simulation in which reionization occurred at @xmath134 and the heat input was tracked in a non - equilibrium manner ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter simulation shows hotter temperatures in the low - density regions , with the discrepancy growing towards lower densities , as expected .",
    "while we are currently unable to perform non - equilibrium simulations of reionization , we can add the difference in the temperatures _ post facto _ to estimate the potential effect of the additional thermal energy .",
    "thermal pressure gradients are small compared to gravitational forces in low density regions , so the dynamics of the gas should be unaffected by higher temperatures , and the _ post facto _ change of the temperature - density relation therefore accounts accurately for the full effect of reionization heating . in support of this claim ,",

    "we perform the same civ analysis on the reionization heated spectra to determine the mean metallicity that should be inferred from the observed civ abundance in this hotter igm model .",
    "we find that reionization heating has a negligible effect ( see the dotted line in figure  [ fig : metfrac ] ) because most of the civ absorption arises from systems with overdensities greater than ten , translating to a column density @xmath139 ( cf .",
    "[ [ eqn : rho - nhi ] ] ; also see figure  [ fig : nhist ] ) .    for our ovi analysis ,",
    "the results are somewhat more sensitive to reionization heating because ovi arises in lower density regions .",
    "if the igm is hotter , more oxygen is ionized to ovii .",
    "however , this is countered by the fact that to match the mean transmission of q1422 in the ly@xmath1  forest region , a hotter igm requires a lower ionizing background intensity .",
    "a hotter igm also means that the tail of ovi lines below a given @xmath94-parameter is smaller , reducing the efficiency of our narrow line search procedure for detecting ovi and therefore increasing the ovi abundance inferred from a given number of detections .",
    "this last effect turns out to be minimal ; the dominant effects are the first two , with the first being somewhat more important .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ovihot ] ( solid line ) , indicating that the maximum metallicity allowed for agreement with the ovi data is around @xmath140 instead of @xmath141 .",
    "so , in the final analysis , the effect of reionization heating does not significantly change our overall conclusion that a uniform metallicity of @xmath73 is inconsistent with the ovi data .",
    "a more dramatic effect arises if the ionizing background contains many fewer photons capable of ionizing oxygen to ovi .",
    "such a scenario might arise if , for example , helium reionization has not occurred by @xmath25 .",
    "we consider an idealized model of such a scenario in this section .    to test the sensitivity of our analysis to the softness of the assumed ionizing background , we generate a new @xmath63 with the shape from @xcite , except that the intensity is reduced by a factor of ten above 4  ry ; we refer to this as the _ cut _ @xmath63 .",
    "we generate a new set of artificial spectra using this cut @xmath63 ; the mean transmission is virtually identical to that of the original spectra because these high energy photons do not significantly affect the hi opacity . with the cut @xmath63",

    "this shows that a metallicity of @xmath143 is in agreement with the ovi data .",
    "the cut @xmath63 scenario therefore implies a mean metallicity in the ly@xmath1  forest of around @xmath144 . with the assumed [ o / c ]",
    "@xmath145 , this scenario is consistent with a uniform metallicity ; however , we shall show in  [ sec : pixmet ] that a cut @xmath63 also requires a much higher oxygen overabundance , thus a metallicity gradient is still required .",
    "there is some evidence that helium reionization occurs around @xmath146 , from a sudden drop in the siiv / civ ratio near that redshift ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this evidence is controversial , as other studies have not detected such a drop ( @xcite ) , though @xcite shows that it appears with several different methods of analysis .",
    "if many more ovi lines were detected in quasar spectra at @xmath147 , this would provide an interesting argument in favor of the helium reionization scenario .",
    "while q1422 is poorly suited for this investigation , we hope that in the future we can examine other quasar spectra over a wider range of redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fig : metfrac ] implies that an increase in ovi due to a change in the ionizing background shape should be accompanied by an increase in civ / hi ratios .",
    "one piece of evidence arguing that helium _ has _ been reionized by this epoch is the measurement of the heii opacity at @xmath148 by @xcite . from the strength of a heii discontinuity about 5.3  from quasar q0302 - 003 , they find @xmath149 ( @xmath150 errors ) .",

    "a more secure determination of @xmath155 at @xmath27 may have to await the deployment of the cosmic origins spectrograph on the hubble space telescope .",

    "376 out of a total of roughly 25,000 pixels redwards of the ly@xmath1  emission peak are selected as having significant civ absorption .",
    "for each of the selected pixels , we find the optical depth at the associated ovi position and calculate the  apparent column density ratio \" : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the optical depth , @xmath159 is the rest wavelength , and @xmath160 is the oscillator strength for each ion .",
    "@xmath161 is not the true ovi column density because there is a significant contribution from coincident hi absorption .",
    "although the lox plot of figure  [ fig : lox ] shows that the detectability of civ and ovi peaks at different hi column densities , it also shows that the weaker ( and therefore more common ) civ lines , associated with @xmath162 , should have significant amounts of photoionized ovi .",
    "this is seen when we apply the optical depth ratio technique to artificial spectra with oxygen ( [ o / h ]  @xmath97 ) and without oxygen , the latter being used to assess the contribution from coincident hi absorption .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : pixmet ] , as a histogram of @xmath163 ( this is similar to figures  20e - g from @xcite , except that @xcite uses randomly selected regions of the observed spectrum instead of a zero - metallicity model spectrum as the `` control '' sample ) .",
    "there is a significant excess of ovi seen in the [ o / h ]  @xmath97 spectra ( solid line ) as compared to the spectra without no oxygen ( dotted line ) ; this is mostly due to photoionized ovi associated with civ absorbers , as the covering fraction of collisionally ionized ovi is quite small .",
    "we also apply the technique to q1422 , and find a significant presence of ovi , consistent with @xcite . the q1422 results ( dashed histogram in figure  [ fig : pixmet ] )",
    "are seen to be in better agreement with the @xmath73 spectra than with the zero - metallicity spectra .",
    "we will quantify these results further in the next section .",
    "our conclusion from optical depth ratios that [ o / h ]  @xmath8 may seem inconsistent with our earlier conclusion from narrow lines that [ o / h ]  @xmath164 , but it is not , _ provided _ that the igm metallicity is lower at lower gas densities . with the narrow line detection algorithm",
    ", we are examining _ all _ regions of space for ovi absorption , so the measure is weighted towards the low - density regions that occupy most of the volume .",
    "conversely , the optical depth ratio technique examines regions of space selected to have significant civ absorption , which are typically higher density regions .",
    "in fact , from  [ sec : civ ] we _ know _ the metallicity in these regions is @xmath165 in the full hm spectrum case , or @xmath144 in the case of our cut @xmath63 spectrum ( cf .  [ sec : cut ] ) .",
    "thus , we can use the detection of ovi in these regions as a probe of the shape of the ionizing background and the assumed oxygen overabundance , as we will show in the next section .    for regions that have detectable civ absorption , the optical depth ratio technique is significantly more sensitive to the presence of ovi than the narrow line detection algorithm .",
    "because most ovi positions are contaminated by hi absorption , the opportunity to detect a narrow ovi line associated with civ is very rare .",
    "the optical depth ratio technique can still achieve a statistical detection of ovi in such cases because it examines only the precise locations of expected ovi absorption and compares their mean optical depth to an ovi - free control sample .",
    "we attempted to quantify the presence of ovi associated with ly@xmath1  absorption of a given optical depth , but were unsuccessful .",
    "the optical depth ratio technique is much less reliable when used with hi rather than civ , since the typical line widths of hi features are significantly different from those of civ or ovi ; it is only because ovi and civ have similar thermal broadening ( and identical bulk flow broadening because we are examing the same physical region ) that optical depths at associated wavelengths can be meaningfully compared .",
    "we now apply the optical depth ratio technique to artificial spectra with varying metallicity . for the artificial spectra , the assumed [ c / h ]",
    "is held fixed at the value that produces agreement with the civ data ( @xmath92 for the @xcite spectrum and @xmath166 for the cut spectrum ) , and we vary only [ o / h ] ( or equivalently , the oxygen overabundance ) .",
    "we plot the median value of @xmath167 , since the median provides the most robust characteristic quantity in this highly skewed distribution .",
    "the median @xmath168 for q1422 , and @xmath169 for the artificial spectra without oxygen .",
    "these values are shown as the horizontal dashed and dotted lines in figure  [ fig : zpix ] , respectively .",
    "the varying [ o / h ] case is shown by the solid line , with the error bars as usual computed over the six artificial spectra ( the error bars on the other artificial spectra measurements are comparable ) .",
    "agreement with q1422 is seen to occur at [ o / h ]  @xmath170 , and given that the metallicity of these regions is [ c / h ]  @xmath3 , this implies [ o / c ]  @xmath24 .",
    "thus for the case of the hm spectrum , we have independently determined that our assumed oxygen overabundance is consistent with q1422 .",
    "we now examine the cut @xmath63 spectrum case , as shown by the dot - dashed line in figure  [ fig : zpix ] . with a softer spectrum ,",
    "ovi is much less abundant and civ is more abundant , meaning that a significantly higher overabundance of oxygen is required to reach agreement with the q1422 data for ovi associated with civ regions .",
    "agreement is reached with q1422 s median @xmath171 for [ o / h ]  @xmath172 , which when combined with [ c / h ]  @xmath142 for the cut spectrum implies [ o / c ]  @xmath173 .",
    "a factor of @xmath174 oxygen overabundance seems fairly implausible , as no set of objects has ever been observed to have @xmath1-process overabundances approaching this level .",
    "we conclude that the regions showing civ absorption are in much better agreement with a @xcite spectrum with no softening above 4  ry , and therefore that most helium is doubly ionized by redshift @xmath23 .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with an oxygen overabundance of [ o / c ]  @xmath24 .",
    "free we can assess the presence of a gradient of metallicity with density , free from assumptions about the oxygen overabundance , by comparing [ o / h ] from the narrow associated with civ regions with the limits on [ o / h ] in lower density gas from the narrow line detection algorithm . for the @xcite spectrum case , civ regions have [ o / h ]  @xmath8 , while the narrow line search [ o / h ]  @xmath175 , implying at least a factor of 3 decrease in metallicity at lower densities . for the cut @xmath63 spectrum ,",
    "civ regions have [ o / h ]  @xmath172 , whereas the narrow line search yields [ o / h ]  @xmath125 , implying an even _ greater _ metallicity gradient .",
    "thus regardless of the assumed ionizing background , a metallicity gradient is required to match the observed amount of ovi from both detection methods , barring the unlikely scenarios that the metagalactic ionizing flux is significantly _ harder _ than the @xcite spectrum , or the oxygen overabundance is significantly lower in the lower density regions .      as mentioned before",
    ", @xcite detected a significant jump in siiv / civ ratio above @xmath146 , that when combined with the siiv / civ ratio above @xmath146 , which , when combined with photoionization models , is consistent with an ionizing spectrum heavily truncated ( by a factor @xmath174 ) above 4  ry .",
    "this inference is in direct contradiction with the results of the previous section .",
    "one way to reconcile these results may be to invoke an igm that has a patchy ionization structure .",
    "this type of structure is implied by the heii measurements of @xcite , as stated in  [ sec : cut ] , and has been suggested by @xcite to explain the significant presence of ovi detected at @xmath27 . in this section",
    "we consider a simplistic , `` 50/50 '' model of such a patchy igm to determine the implications for our ovi detections .",
    "consider a universe where half the volume has already reionized helium ( and hence has an @xcite spectrum ) , and half the volume has a significantly truncated ionizing flux above 4  ry ( as in our cut @xmath63 spectrum ) .",
    "civ absorption then implies a mean metallicity of [ c / h ]  @xmath176 .",
    "this value can be determined from figure  [ fig : metfrac ] , as this is the metallicity where the solid ( @xcite spectrum ) and dashed ( cut spectrum ) curves are roughly equally above and below the observed @xmath177 of q1422 .",
    "the additional scatter introduced by the varying ionization conditions implies that there can be virtually no intrinsic spatial scatter in the metallicity of civ absorbers .",
    "similarly , bisecting the solid and dot - dashed curves in figure  [ fig : zpix ] implies agreement with the q1422 optical depth ratio results at [ o / h]@xmath178 . taken together ,",
    "the [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] constraints imply [ o / c ]  @xmath179 in the 50/50 model .",
    "this overabundance is perhaps marginally plausible if one invokes enrichment almost entirely from high - mass stars yielding a high fraction of @xmath1-process elements .",
    "the narrow line detection results become statistically consistent with the q1422 data only for [ o / h ]  @xmath175 ( metallicity @xmath180 ) , as seen by bisecting the solid and dot - dashed curves in figure  [ fig : ovicut ] .",
    "thus , a metallicity gradient is still required in the 50/50 model , as the optical depth ratio technique ( tracing civ regions only ) yields [ o / h ] higher by @xmath181  dex than the narrow line detection technique ( tracing mostly lower density regions ) .    while the 50/50 patchy igm model is marginally consistent with the ovi data , it remains to be seen whether such a scenario is consistent with the observations of siiv / civ by @xcite .",
    "currently , with only one quasar spectrum available to us , we do not have sufficient statistics to investigate siiv in detail ; we plan to conduct these investigations when more data become available , preferably at @xmath147 as well as at @xmath27 .",
    "we present a systematic search for ovi absorption in the spectrum of q1422 + 231 ( @xmath0 ) , using a narrow line detection algorithm proven effective at identifying ovi absorption in artificial spectra , and an optical depth ratio technique introduced by @xcite .",
    "the first technique traces ovi predominantly in systems with @xmath182 , whereas the second technique traces only ovi associated with civ absorption , in @xmath183 systems . by comparing q1422 and artificial spectra having varying metallicities",
    ", we determine that    1 .",
    "[ o / h ] must be lower in lower density regions , for either an @xcite ionizing background or an ionizing background significantly truncated above 4  ry .",
    "if [ o / c ] is constant in systems up to @xmath184 , our results imply that regions traced by @xmath30 systems ( corresponding to gas at roughly the mean baryonic density ) have a mean metallicity lower by at least a factor of 3 compared to regions traced by @xmath162 systems ( corresponding to a baryonic overdensity of @xmath29 ) .",
    "2 .   more than half the universe must have helium reionized by @xmath25 .",
    "if helium has completely reionized by @xmath23 ( the highest redshift probed by the q1422 data ) , then our analysis implies [ o / c ]  @xmath24 , in good agreement with overabundance measurements of type ii supernovae enriched systems .",
    "if a significant portion of the universe has not reionized helium by @xmath25 and therefore has a softer ionizing background spectrum , then the required oxygen overabundance is higher . for example , if half of the volume has not reionized helium , then [ o / c ]  @xmath179 , already greater than the observed overabundance of any class of type ii supernovae enriched systems . if the spectrum were soft throughout the universe at @xmath27 then an implausibly high overabundance , [ o / c ]  @xmath173 , would be required .",
    "these conclusions are in good agreement with the recent study of @xcite , who used composite spectra to investigate civ absorption in systems with @xmath185 and found that the metallicity of these absorbers must be [ c / h ]  @xmath186 .",
    "cosmological simulations show that @xmath187 roughly corresponds to the dividing line between overdense and underdense regions of the universe ( though the value of @xmath90 that marks this division depends on redshift and , to a lesser extent , on cosmological parameters ) .",
    "our results therefore imply that mildly overdense regions such as filaments and sheets have been enriched , while underdense regions are virtually chemically pristine .",
    "simulations that self - consistently enrich the igm by tracking metal production and transport find that a strong metallicity gradient is predicted between the mildly overdense and underdense regions ( see figure  3 in @xcite ) ; this predicted gradient is in good agreement with the @xcite data and with the scenario we present above .",
    "recent measurements of a jump in the siiv / civ ratio around @xmath25 ( @xcite ) may be difficult to reconcile with conclusion  ( 2 ) above .",
    "while we have yet to conduct a systematic comparison of siiv in observed and artificial spectra , primarily because of the small numbers of siiv systems detectable in our one available quasar spectrum , we expect our results will be in agreement with @xcite , who argues that such a jump requires a much softer ionizing background at @xmath27 . one way to reconcile these results may be to invoke patchy helium reionization at that epoch , as suggested by @xcite ; such a model may be tested in greater detail by searching for an anti - correlation between ovi and siiv detections .",
    "if helium reionization occurs around @xmath25 , our narrow line algorithm should yield many more ovi detections at redshifts @xmath188 .",
    "such searches are difficult because of the poor blue sensitivity of the hires spectrograph ( and complete loss of sensitivity at @xmath189 ) , but quasar spectra do exist that could provide constraints down to @xmath190 . the presence of a substantial number of ovi lines in this regime would strongly favor the late helium reionization scenario ; there is already some weak evidence that ovi is more abundant at @xmath147 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if ovi features continue to be virtually undetectable down to @xmath190 , this would be compelling evidence against the late helium reionization scenario , since the heii absorption measurements of davidsen , kriss , & zheng ( 1996 ) imply that helium has been reionized by this redshift .",
    "we hope to work with observers to attempt this search in the near future .    in a broader context ,",
    "our work illustrates the power of combining cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation with high - quality quasar spectra to infer the ionization state and the enrichment history of the high - redshift igm .",
    "future observations and simulations promise a wealth of information , which , when combined , will help us to better understand the evolution of the igm and its connection to early star formation and the epoch of primeval galaxies .",
    "we are very grateful to antoinette songaila and len cowie for making their keck quasar spectrum of q1422 + 231 available to us .",
