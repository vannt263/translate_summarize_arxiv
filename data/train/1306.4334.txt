    "the study of multiplicity among pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars is of key importance to our understanding of the process of star formation , and to interpret the observed multiplicities of normal stars in the solar neighborhood , which are evolved from the younger populations .",
    "a recent review of stellar multiplicity by @xcite noted that while imaging surveys of pms stars by many teams have turned up significant numbers of visual binaries , our knowledge of tighter systems typically discovered in spectroscopic surveys is considerably more incomplete among young stars .",
    "this is unfortunate , as close binaries for which the orbital elements are known provide very useful constraints on star formation theory from the distributions of their mass ratios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as their periods and other properties .",
    "they also present an opportunity to improve our understanding of tidal circularization theory @xcite .",
    "importantly , in favorable cases they allow the determination of the dynamical masses of the components , which are essential for testing models of stellar evolution for young stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "relatively few pms stars have this information available , and as a result evolution models for young stars are much more poorly constrained than those for their main - sequence counterparts .    an account of our state of knowledge about multiple systems among pms stars by @xcite listed a grand total of 25 spectroscopic binaries for which orbits had been established , of which half were unpublished at the time . since then relatively few long - term spectroscopic surveys have been carried out ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and while some have produced new systems with orbital solutions , most additions to the list of binaries with known orbits have come from serendipitous discoveries . slightly more than half of the known pms spectroscopic binaries are double - lined , which are especially valuable in that they provide mass ratios . in recent years",
    "significant efforts have been carried out with good success to detect the faint secondaries of some of the single - lined systems by observing in the near infrared ( nir ) , where the contrast is more favorable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "lkca3  ( also v1098tau , 2massj04144797 + 2752346 , hbc368 ) was listed by @xcite as a single - lined spectroscopic binary in the taurus - auriga star - forming region with an orbital period of 12.941 days and an eccentricity of 0.20 , although the particulars of the orbital solution were not reported there .",
    "it was also known at the time to be a visual binary with an angular separation of 047 @xcite , implying a hierarchical configuration of at least three stars assuming the visual components are physically associated .",
    "its pms status was established earlier by @xcite on the basis of its strong h and k emission and the presence of the @xmath26707 line in absorption .",
    "its spectral type is most often listed as m1 , and from the strength of the h@xmath3 emission line ( @xmath02.5  equivalent width ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is considered a weak - line t tauri star ( wtts ) .",
    "no infrared excess or sub - millimeter emission has been observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the absence of any appreciable surrounding disk material .    beyond their initial use by @xcite to report the discovery of lkca3  as a single - lined spectroscopic binary , the original spectra of this object have not been exploited to the fullest extent now possible with the significant improvements in spectroscopic analysis techniques that have taken place in the intervening years .",
    "this has prompted us to revisit the system .",
    "the motivation for this paper is the discovery that lkca3  is in fact a hierarchical quadruple system , in which each of the visual components is a double - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "full details of the orbital solutions are presented , which incorporate not only the archival spectroscopic material gathered by @xcite but also near - infrared spectroscopy obtained more recently that spatially resolves the visual pair .",
    "lkca3  thus joins the small group of double - lined pms systems with well - established orbits , contributing two new entries to the list .",
    "the quadruple nature of the system enables much stronger tests of pms models than would otherwise be possible .",
    "we take advantage of this opportunity here .",
    "our spectroscopic observations , along with additional high - resolution imaging we have acquired to better characterize the visual binary , allow us to infer the key physical properties of the four stars in the system by comparison with current models of stellar evolution , including an independent estimate of the distance .",
    "the visible - light spectroscopy of lkca3  was collected at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) over a period of a little more than nine years beginning in november of 1985 .",
    "this is largely the same material used by @xcite to obtain the preliminary single - lined orbit of the system , but the details are reported here for the first time .",
    "observations were acquired with nearly identical echelle spectrographs ( digital speedometers ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) attached to the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory on mount hopkins ( az ) , and the 4.5m - equivalent mmt also on mount hopkins , prior to its conversion to a monolithic 6.5 m telescope . a single echelle order 45  wide was recorded using intensified photon - counting reticon detectors , at a central wavelength of about 5190  that includes the lines of the b triplet .",
    "the resolving power of these instruments was @xmath4 , and the signal - to - noise ratios of the observations range from 9 to 21 per resolution element of 8.5kms@xmath5 .",
    "a total of 58 exposures were obtained , although four were later discarded because of moonlight contamination or other problems .",
    "the standard , one - dimensional cross - correlation functions for these spectra clearly show a peak corresponding to the star reported by @xcite to have a variable radial velocity ( rv ) with a period of 12.94 days . occasionally , however , a second peak of similar height is also visible ( see figure  [ fig : ccf ] ) . shortly after the @xcite publication the spectra of lkca3",
    "were subjected to an analysis with todcor , a two - dimensional cross - correlation technique that had just been introduced by @xcite .",
    "todcor is designed to measure radial velocities from double - lined spectra , and uses two templates , one for each set of lines .",
    "it was discovered that the velocities from the second set of lines were not changing with the same period as the first set , but varied instead with a shorter period of 4.06 days .",
    "given that lkca3  is a near equal brightness visual binary with an angular separation ( @xmath005 ) that is smaller than the width of the spectrograph slit ( 1 ) , this immediately suggested the quadruple nature of the system , with each visual component being in turn a spectroscopic binary .",
    "we refer to the 12.94-day binary as system a , with components aa and ab , and to the stars in the other system as ba and bb , although from these observations alone we can not identify which visual component is a and which is b.    this discovery languished for a time , and only more recently did we return to the system in an attempt to detect the secondary star of the 12.94-day system . for this we reanalyzed the spectra using tricor , an extension of todcor to three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the effort was successful , and showed the faint secondary to be only half as massive as the primary . a similar exercise with tricor resulted in the detection of the secondary of the 4.06-day binary , which also has about half the mass of its primary .",

    "very precise trigonometric parallax measurements with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) have shown that different areas within the complex are at slightly different distances .",
    "in particular , pms stars near lynds1495 including hubble4 , hde283572 , and v773tau ( which happens to also be a quadruple system and is only 20  away from lkca3 ) have an average distance of about 130pc @xcite , whereas stars on the eastern side of the complex ( t  taun and hptau / g2 ; * ? ? ?",

    "our estimate of @xmath78pc for lkca3  is formally more consistent with the lower values than the higher ones .",

    "the best fit to the dartmouth models indicates the two binaries are nearly identical in their physical properties .",
    "the orbital inclination angles @xmath57 and @xmath58 combined with our minimum masses result in absolute masses for both primary stars ( aa and ba ) of about 0.51@xmath46 , and masses for the secondaries ( ab and bb ) that are both about 0.27@xmath46 .",

    "[ sec : optical ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : astrometry ] . at face value",
    "the measurements in table  [ tab : constraints ] suggest star a is slightly brighter than b in the @xmath15 band ( @xmath79 ) , but fainter in @xmath60 ( @xmath80 ) . while these differences may perhaps be real , and",
    "would be explained by the fact that the flux of each visual component is the sum of the contributions of two young stars , their significance is marginal .",
    "the orbital periods of lkca3a ( 12.94 days ) and lkca3b ( 4.06 days ) are on either side of the observed tidal circularization period for pms stars ( considered as a more or less coeval population of young objects ) , which represents the transition between circular and eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "this transition period is currently believed to be near 7.6 days , and is marked by the binary system rx  j1603.9@xmath63938 , which has the longest - period circular orbit among bona - fide pms stars @xcite .",
    "our finding that the orbit of lkca3b is essentially circular is consistent with this picture .",
    "two other effects of tidal forces , the alignment of the spin axes with the orbital axis and the synchronization of the stellar rotations with the mean orbital motion , are predicted to occur much earlier than circularization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we may reasonably assume that these conditions also apply to the two components of lkca3b .",
    "in other words , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . if that is the case , then our measurement of the projected rotational velocities ( which are strictly @xmath83 ) provides a way to infer the mean stellar densities , as described by @xcite , if we assume solid - body rotation . from the orbital elements and @xmath68 the density @xmath84 of star ba in solar units",
    "may be expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is in days , the velocity semi - amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 are in kms@xmath5 , and the numerical constant is an update of that of @xcite .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath89 .",
    "the non - circular orbit we find for lkca3a ( with @xmath90 ) is consistent with the fact that its period is longer than the transition period for pms stars .",
    "rotational synchronization is therefore not guaranteed , so we can not assume that @xmath91 .",
    "we note , however , that long - term photometric monitoring of lkca3  has shown a clear periodic signal with an amplitude of one or two tenths of a magnitude attributed to rotational modulation due to spots , although the multiplicity of the system has previously made it difficult to attribute the signal to any particular component .",
    "the period reported by @xcite from a 45-day observing campaign is @xmath92 days , and a similar result of 7.38 days was obtained by @xcite over a two - month period .",
    "more extensive observations by @xcite between 1992 and 1998 yielded rotation periods in close agreement for each of 5 separate seasons having sufficient observations , with an average of 7.35 days .",
    "more recently @xcite reported a period of 3.689 days from observations carried out over two months .",
    "this is very nearly half of the previous values , suggesting it may be a harmonic of the true period .",
    "the rotation signal in lkca3  is likely to be due to either star aa or ba , simply on the basis that they are much brighter than the secondaries .",
    "we proceed under this assumption , and return to it below . furthermore ,",
    "if our earlier hypothesis of synchronized rotation for ba and bb is correct , then the signal would be associated with star aa , which is also marginally the brighter .",
    "evidence supporting this comes from the intensive photometric observations by @xcite , totaling about 1350 measurements over a two - month period in a broad passband similar to @xmath60+@xmath93 .",
    "their power spectrum of the observations shows a hint of a second peak near a period of 4 days .",
    "our reanalysis of those data is illustrated in figure  [ fig : periodograms ] .",
    "the top panel presents a lomb - scargle periodogram of the original observations with the 7.38-day signal clearly visible .",
    "the photometric amplitude of this signal is approximately 0.10 mag , and we estimate the uncertainty in the period to be 0.40 days the peaks at periods under two days are all aliases with the 1-day cycle of the observations .",
    "this is seen more clearly in the second panel , where we have subjected the same data to the clean algorithm of @xcite that reduces the impact of the window function .",
    "we then subtracted a sine curve with a period of 7.38 days from the original measurements , and computed a lomb - scargle periodogram of the residuals ( figure  [ fig : periodograms]c ) .",
    "a prominent peak is revealed at a period of @xmath94 days , with a false alarm probability smaller than @xmath95 , determined from monte carlo simulations .",
    "this signal has a smaller photometric amplitude of about 0.05 mag .",
    "once again the peaks at much shorter periods are aliases , as shown by the cleaned power spectrum in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "the close similarity with the orbital period of lkca3b ( @xmath96 ; table  [ tab : orbits ] ) strongly suggests that this second signal corresponds to the rotational signature of star ba , tidally locked to the mean orbital motion , as we had assumed .",
    "we conclude that the 7.38-day signal corresponds indeed to star aa , which is then spinning more rapidly than the expected pseudo - synchronous rate ( @xmath97 days ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also faster than the periastron rate ( 9.0 days ) .",
    "the evidence that the above signals originate on the primaries of lkca3a and b rather than the secondaries relies on statistics from variability studies of non - accreting periodic t  tauri stars .",
    "if star ab were the source of the 7.38-day signal , the photometric amplitude corrected for the light contribution of the other components of the quadruple system ( table  [ tab : constraints ] ) would be in excess of 1.5 mag .",
    "this is a very rare occurrence among wtts ( typical amplitudes are about 0.10.2 mag ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , if attributed to star aa , the intrinsic amplitude would be only 0.24 mag , which is fairly common .",
    "similarly for the 4.06-day signal , the intrinsic amplitudes we would infer for stars ba and bb are 0.5 mag and 0.12 mag .",
    "though not unprecedented , the larger value is seen much less frequently than the smaller one in photometric studies of young stars . in any event ,",
    "assignment of the observed signal to the primary or secondary in this case is less important , as rotational synchronization is likely to occur in both components given the short period and circular orbit , as discussed earlier .    with our measurement of the projected rotational velocity of aa from table  [ tab :",
    "constraints ] and knowledge of its rotation period , we may compute its mean density in a similar way as done for lkca3b with a slight modification of eq.([eq : densb ] ) : @xmath98 however , this still requires the assumption that the spin axis of star aa is aligned with the axis of the orbit ( @xmath81 ) , which may or may not be true given the longer orbital period of the binary and its young age .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : modelsdens ] shows that the mean densities of stars ba and bb computed in this way , and also that of aa , seem to agree quite well with predictions from our best - fit 1.6-myr isochrone , even though they were not used in that fit .",
    "it is important to note that in our earlier model comparison there is a certain amount of degeneracy between distance and age because evolutionary tracks are mostly vertical in a diagram of magnitude versus color ( or temperature ) such as figure  [ fig : models ] ; a similarly good agreement with the models can be obtained for a smaller distance if one chooses an older age .",
    "on the other hand , the mean stellar densities from eq.([eq : densb ] ) and eq.([eq : densa ] ) are completely independent of distance , but strongly constrain the age , and are therefore complementary to the brightness measurements . since the top panel of figure  [ fig : modelsdens ] suggests a somewhat better fit",
    "may be had with a slightly younger age , we repeated the comparison incorporating the densities of stars ba and bb as additional constraints , though not that of star aa because of lingering doubts regarding its spin - orbit alignment .",
    "the new fit gives an age of @xmath99 myr , a distance of @xmath100pc , and inclination angles for the binaries of @xmath101 deg and @xmath102 deg , which are not very different from our previous results .",
    "this new best - fit isochrone is shown with the density measurements in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : modelsdens ] .",
    "the agreement with the flux measurements is not significantly altered .",
    "the uncertainties are now smaller , especially for the distance and age , because use of the densities suppresses the age - distance correlation to a significant degree .",
    "this is illustrated graphically in figure  [ fig : correlations ] .",
    "the masses of the stars do not change appreciably , but the radii are now somewhat larger because of the slightly younger age ( approximately 1.63@xmath53 for stars",
    "aa and ba , and 1.27@xmath53 for ab and bb ) .      given the multiple constraints on the models afforded by the observations for lkca3 , we investigated the possibility that the data might enable us to determine the distance to each binary independently , and perhaps disprove our assumption that lkca3a and b are physically associated . because some of these constraints including the flux ratios and combined magnitudes involve properties of both binaries , it is not possible to carry out completely independent solutions as the individual colors and magnitudes of the binary components",
    "are strongly correlated .",
    "instead , we performed a joint solution involving all four stars as before , but we allowed the distance as well as the age and inclination angle of each binary to vary independently , for a total of six free parameters .",
    "however , since the mean stellar density constraint is applied only for stars ba and bb , the parameters for lkca3a are more poorly determined , and the distances turn out to be indistinguishable within their formal errors : @xmath103pc for lkca3a , and @xmath104pc for lkca3b .",
    "the ages are @xmath105myr and @xmath106myr , and the inclination angles @xmath107deg and @xmath108deg , respectively .",
    "the parameters for lkca3b are close to those reported previously , as expected from the strength of the density constraint .",
    "lkca3  is perhaps a unique case among pms stars because of the many observational constraints available for the comparison with stellar evolution models , and the fact that we know these properties for four stars in the same system that are presumably coeval . beyond the effective temperatures and relative fluxes in several passbands , which are sometimes available for other pms binaries , in lkca3  we have also dynamical information in the form of minimum masses for all stars , and the additional constraint from the mean densities for at least two of the components .",
    "while the inferred age and particularly the distance are in excellent agreement with expectations for the taurus - auriga complex , these results are specific to the dartmouth models of @xcite . as a test we repeated the exercise with the earlier but widely used series of lyon models by @xcite , which differ in the degree of convection assumed , among other physical ingredients . while the dartmouth models adopt a mixing length parameter of @xmath109 in units of the pressure scale height that yields a good fit to the solar properties , the publicly available lyon models for low - mass stars use @xmath110 . with these models we obtained a slightly older age of @xmath111 myr and a rather different distance of @xmath112 pc for lkca3  that seems implausibly high for taurus - auriga .",
    "the quality of the fit is generally worse , giving a @xmath70 value of @xmath065 as opposed to @xmath032 .",
    "a few of the measurements deviate by more than 3@xmath76 , which was not the case before , although there is no obvious pattern in the @xmath113 residuals ( see figure  [ fig : residuals ] ) except that the predicted temperatures seem consistently higher than observed .",
    "the inclination angles of the two binaries come out considerably smaller ( @xmath114 deg and @xmath115 deg ) , resulting in component masses that are essentially a factor of two larger than our previous results .",
    "the primaries of the two binaries become @xmath01@xmath46 stars , which seems unreasonably high for an m star .",
    "a more direct comparison between the dartmouth and lyon models is illustrated in figure  [ fig : comparemodels ] , for two representative solar - metallicity isochrones of 1myr and 10myr .",
    "the differences are shown both in the theoretical plane of @xmath116 vs.@xmath61 and in the observational plane of @xmath117 vs.  @xmath77 employed earlier in this work .",
    "points with equal mass on both sets of models are connected with dotted lines .",
    "several features are noteworthy .",
    "the lyon models of @xcite appear systematically higher in the diagrams , particularly at 1myr , explaining the larger distance obtained . while the bolometric luminosities are similar in both models at a given mass , the temperatures are higher in the dartmouth series , increasingly so for larger masses . in the observational plane",
    "there are large differences in color of nearly 2 mag for @xmath118 , which are partly attributable to the temperature differences just mentioned , and perhaps also to the color / temperature transformations used in each model .",
    "this is the reason for the much larger masses we obtain for lkca3  when using the @xcite models .",
    "all of these differences are seen to be larger at younger ages , which is where the models are most sensitive to initial conditions , and also where the calculations are known to be less reliable ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note also that neither set of models incorporates the effects of magnetic fields , which are ubiquitous among pms stars and have been shown to have a significant impact on theoretical predictions for young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the same has been found more generally for late - type active main - sequence stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the popularity of the lyon models with @xmath110 for pms stars and the relatively infrequent use the dartmouth models have had so far in this area of research motivate us to examine these discrepancies in more detail below , for the impact they may have on our knowledge of young stars .",
    "the poor performance of the lyon models of @xcite in the case of lkca3  may seem surprising given that they have been employed in numerous studies since their appearance , and have even been used to help define the temperature scale for late - type pms stars ( see below ) .",
    "on relatively few occasions have difficulties with these models been documented in the young - star literature ( for examples see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may have to do with the nature and large number of observational constraints for lkca3 , in contrast with the typical situation for young stars . a somewhat similar case to lkca3  in terms of the strength of the observational constraints",
    "is that of ggtau , which is another hierarchical quadruple pms system comprised of two visual binaries in the taurus - auriga star - forming region .",
    "this system is often regarded as a benchmark for testing evolutionary calculations for young stars , and the observations for ggtau are generally considered to support the validity of the lyon models , in apparent contradiction with our findings for lkca3 .    for ggtau",
    "the individual spectral types ( k7+m0 and m5+m7 ) and luminosities ( for an assumed distance of 140pc ) are known for all four components from the work of @xcite .",
    "additionally , the total mass of one of the binaries ( ggtaua ) has been estimated from measurements of the orbital velocities of the circumbinary disk ( @xmath119 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as in lkca3 , the four stars in ggtau form a `` mini - cluster '' of sorts ( on the assumption that they are coeval ) , which means they provide an unusually strong constraint on stellar evolution theory because a successful model must be able to reproduce the properties of all four components at a single age .",
    "this was exploited by @xcite to test the lyon models , among others , and in the process to establish a conversion between spectral types and effective temperatures for late - type pms stars , which has been a persistent source of uncertainty in the field .",
    "the authors showed that the solar - metallicity lyon models with @xmath110 , which are the same ones we used for lkca3 , provide a good match to the effective temperatures and luminosities of all four stars in ggtau ( see their fig.6 ) , but yield a predicted total mass for ggtaua of @xmath120 that is considerably larger than observed .",
    "thus , these models fail as in the case of lkca3 .",
    "the temperatures in this analysis were converted from spectral types , but were allowed some freedom for the cooler stars ba and bb in order to produce the best fit , which resulted in an implied temperature scale for the spt/@xmath61 conversion that is intermediate between dwarfs and giants .",
    "the two scales converge for the hotter stars aa and ab , which were not adjusted separately .",
    "@xcite also tested lyon models computed with a higher mixing length parameter of @xmath121 appropriate for the sun .",
    "these were found to produce a similarly good agreement with the temperatures ( readjusted for ba and bb ) and luminosities , and a lower mass for ggtaua of @xmath122 that is in better accord with the dynamically measured value .",
    "very similar conclusions were reached by @xcite for the @xmath123 models from lyon , apparently lending support to their accuracy .",
    "we point out , however , that the @xmath121 models employed by the above authors are actually a `` hybrid '' , since published tabulations from the lyon group with this mixing length parameter only reach down to 0.6@xmath46 .",
    "below this mass the authors reverted to the @xcite models with @xmath1 , on the assumption that variations in @xmath124 are inconsequential under 0.6@xmath46 @xcite .",
    "as it turns out , 1myr models for the two values of @xmath124 have about the same luminosity at this mass , but temperatures that differ significantly by some 230k , with the @xmath121 calculations being hotter ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "both @xcite and @xcite were then forced to artificially connect the @xmath110 isochrones below 0.6@xmath46 in some smooth fashion with the @xmath121 isochrones at some mass above 0.6@xmath46 in order to bridge the discontinuity , which results in a kink at 0.6@xmath46 and an unsmooth and likely unphysical change in stellar properties across the boundary .",
    "this situation is less than ideal because the @xmath121 models were computed with a helium abundance @xmath125 appropriate for the sun that is not the same as that assumed for the @xmath126 models .",
    "a larger @xmath125 for these young ages ( as in the @xmath127 models ) typically leads to a lower luminosity at a given temperature , with some dependence on mass , so in a strict sense joining the isochrones is inconsistent .",
    "furthermore , the assumption that the models become insensitive to the mixing length parameter below about 0.6@xmath46 is not necessarily valid at early ages for stellar models with low surface gravities and cool temperatures @xcite , and may only hold true for much lower masses ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , a comparison of published lyon models with @xmath121 and @xmath110 shows that the difference in effective temperature at a fixed mass of 0.6@xmath46 rises considerably toward younger ages , from about 60k at 10myr , to 120k at 3myr , and 230k at 1myr , which is the age regime relevant for ggtau .",
    "this undermines the conclusion that the lyon models for `` @xmath127 '' used by @xcite and @xcite agree with the measurements for ggtau , as the comparison may not be very meaningful .",
    "given that the dartmouth models seem to work well for lkca3 , it is of interest to see how they fare when tested against the observed properties of ggtau .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  [ fig : ggtau ] , for an age of 1myr .",
    "the spectral types and luminosities adopted for stars aa and ab are those reported by @xcite , and for stars ba and bb we used the revised determinations by @xcite .",
    "spectral types were converted to effective temperatures with the intermediate scale of @xcite for ba and bb , and the dwarf scale for aa and ab since the difference with the giant scale is insignificant at these earlier spectral types .",
    "for star bb .",
    "] the temperatures were assigned a conservative uncertainty of 150k , corresponding approximately to a spectral type error of one subtype .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ggtau ] star bb is outside the range of masses covered by the dartmouth models , but there is excellent agreement for the other three components of ggtau .",
    "the dynamical mass estimate for ggtaua is also well reproduced by these models : the sum of the inferred masses of stars aa and ab is @xmath128 , to be compared with the measured value of @xmath129 .",
    "the individual masses we derive from the dartmouth models are @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "we note that the spt/@xmath61 conversion of @xcite used in this comparison was established largely using ggtau itself ( specifically , the ba and bb components ) along with the hybrid `` @xmath124 = 1.9 '' models from lyon .",
    "using this to test the dartmouth models may therefore seem to be inconsistent .",
    "however , as seen in figure  [ fig : ggtau ] , the lyon and dartmouth isochrones converge near star ba ( slightly under 0.2@xmath46 ) , so the fact that the dartmouth model is able to match the temperature of this star is not surprising . whether it would also be able to reproduce the temperature of the bb component using the same spt/@xmath61 conversion , if the calculations were extended to lower masses , remains to be seen .",
    "we conclude from the above that , as in the case of lkca3 , the available constraints for the quadruple system ggtau favor the pms dartmouth models over those from lyon with @xmath110 , at least at these young ages .",
    "it is quite possible , however , that the lyon models with the higher value of @xmath121 , if they were available for masses below 0.6@xmath46 , might also perform well , although this can not be verified at the moment .",
    "a second conclusion we may draw is that the dartmouth models do not appear to be inconsistent with the spt/@xmath61 prescription advocated by @xcite , in which a dwarf - like temperature scale is adopted for young stars earlier than m0 and an intermediate scale for later - type stars , although further observational constraints between m1 and m5 are required to confirm this .",
    "based on the examples of ggtau and lkca3  we would expect that in other cases the use of the dartmouth models instead of the @xmath110 lyon models for pms stars would result in generally smaller inferred masses , and slightly younger ages , although this will depend to some extent on the constraints available .",
    "the quadruple system lkca3  presented here provides an unusually stringent test of pms evolution models that appears even stronger than the classical case of ggtau . in both systems",
    "what makes the constraint on theory so strong is the dynamical mass information , and in lkca3  the additional estimates of the mean stellar densities for two of the components . while young clusters , associations , and larger star - forming regions such as ic348 , @xmath133cha , @xmath134cha , chamaeleoni , taurus @xcite and many others do provide some ability to test models from the fact that they are coeval populations , and can also help to establish the spt/@xmath61 relation for pms stars , the constraints they afford are not as tight because of the often large scatter of the measurements in the h - r diagram , and the lack of information on mass .",
    "the dartmouth models of @xcite , with their consistent physics across the entire mass range , are strongly favored by the observations of lkca3  and ggtau over the lyon models with @xmath110 .",
    "in retrospect , the performance of the latter models when confronted with the challenge of multiple complementary constraints for the same stellar system is not entirely surprising , as there is no obvious physical reason why the mixing length parameter should have precisely that value .",
    "the present study has shown that the dartmouth models are also preferred over the hybrid lyon models with `` @xmath121 '' considered by @xcite , @xcite , and others , which _ do not _ use consistent physics .",
    "other than the present work , relatively few tests of the dartmouth models for pre - main sequence stars have been reported in the literature , but are highly desirable to strengthen our confidence in the predictive power of these calculations .",
    "binary and multiple systems are especially suited for this , and other information for these or other young objects can be extremely helpful such as trigonometric parallaxes ( which the gaia space mission is expected to supply in the near future ) , angular diameters , and chemical analyses including determinations of the lithium abundance .",
    "for example , although strong @xmath26707 in absorption is present in lkca3 , the multiplicity of the system has so far made a quantitative interpretation of those measurements impossible .",
    "the recent high - resolution spectroscopic study by @xcite did not report li measurements , but a graphical representation of the li region for their four spectra shows several components which we can now identify from our orbital solutions .",
    "stars aa , ba , and bb all exhibit the line in absorption , though we see no sign of star ab , the faintest one of the four . with knowledge of the flux ratios from our work , it should now be possible to re - analyze the original @xcite spectra and derive li abundances for at least three of the stars , properly corrected for the light contribution from the other components .",
    "this could serve as an important additional constraint on stellar evolution models .",
