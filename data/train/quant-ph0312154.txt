    "those multi - partite quantum systems which are fundamental objects of statistical and solid state physics , have been found interesting also from a perspective of quantum information processing .",
    "these systems often exhibit multi - partite entanglement that can be used either for quantum information processing or quantum communication . amongst such systems a distinguished role is played by exactly solvable models , such as the ising model describing a chain of interacting spin-1/2 particles in an external magnetic field .",
    "eigenstates of the corresponding model hamiltonian can be studied from a perspective of quantum information theory with a good physical motivation : any quantum computer is a physical device composed of elementary units , qubits , described by a certain hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , perfect knowledge of the hamiltonians and their eigenvectors are vital .",
    "an important condition the physical system has to fulfil is the possibility of preparation of an _ a priori _ known initial state .",
    "the easiest way to realize this task is to simply let the system evolve into its ground state .",
    "thus the knowledge of the entanglement properties of the ground state or more practically thermal states are necessary .",
    "this has been followed by many authors . in particular ,",
    "various versions of the heisenberg model ( xx , xy , xyz ) have been investigated .",
    "many of these studies concern numerical and analytical investigations primarily focused on the behaviour of _ bipartite _ entanglement of small number of qubits in ground and thermal states , e.g. refs .",
    "the notion of `` thermal entanglement '' , i.e. the entanglement of thermal states is introduced , and its properties including threshold temperatures and magnetic field dependence are studied .",
    "symmetry properties of multi - partite systems have been used to calculate entanglement among their constituents . in ref .",
    "@xcite thermal equilibrium states of isotropic two - spin systems are analysed exploiting su(2 ) invariance .",
    "the results are related to isotropic heisenberg models . in ref .",
    "@xcite , analytical expressions for certain entanglement measures are derived using general symmetries of the quantum spin system .",
    "then they are used for the xxz model in order to calculate concurrence and the critical temperature for disentanglement for finite systems with up to six qubits .",
    "it should be noted , that they use the 3-tangle to analyse some multi - partite entanglement aspects of the system , and discuss entanglement sharing in detail .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors pointed out , that in a finite chain of qubits , the time evolution generated by the ising hamiltonian produces `` entanglement oscillations '' , which lead to the presence of ghz and w type entangled states .",
    "a generalisation to 2d and 3d models is also outlined .",

    "a central question in the problem of entanglement of more than two systems is that of bounds on entanglement .",
    "three or more quantum systems can not be arbitrarily entangled in the similar way as they can not be arbitrarily classically correlated  @xcite .",
    "the state with an _ a priori _ specified entanglement properties may not exits at all  @xcite and therefore the search for a state with given , in a sense optimal entanglement properties , is in general a hard problem . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors have solved such particular problems by minimising the energy of a hamiltonian .",
    "that is , the sought state with a given pairwise entanglement is the ground state of a hamiltonian with a very clear physical interpretation .",
    "since such states may be useful for quantum information processing it is desirable to known the concrete form of the states that are either optimal , or obey certain bounds .",
    "it should be pointed out that the problem of finding entangled webs with given properties has been extensively addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite but without any reference to systems described with hamiltonians .",
    "thus it is interesting to see how this issue can be approached in other exactly solvable models .",
    "another interesting issue concerning such models of many - body systems is the collective behaviour of these systems under certain conditions known as the critical phenomena .",
    "let us point out that these phenomena has already been studied extensively .",
    "on the other hand it has been pointed out only recently  @xcite that entanglement is the quantity that _ may _ play a crucial role in the description and understanding of critical phenomena .",
    "the central concept of the theory of critical phenomena is the universality - the critical exponents characterising divergences near critical points are the same for all systems belonging to the same universality class . for a special class of one - dimensional magnetic systems",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the bipartite entanglement shows scaling behaviour near the transition point .",
    "one should also expect , that precursors of the critical behaviour may appear even in non - critical systems .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed investigation of the well known ising model of a chain ( ring ) of spin-1/2 particles ( qubits ) in a transverse magnetic field ( section ii ) .",
    "we present explicit expressions for eigenstates of the model hamiltonian for arbitrary number of spin-1/2 particles in the chain in the standard ( computer ) basis and we investigate quantum entanglement between individual qubits ( sections iii and iv ) .",
    "we analyse bi - partite as well as multi - partite entanglement in the ground state of the model . in particular , we show that bi - partite entanglement between pairs of qubits of the ising chain ( measured in term of a concurrence defined in section ii ) as a function of the parameter @xmath0 has a maximum around the point @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , it monotonically decreases for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "we prove that in the limit @xmath2 this state is locally unitary equivalent to an @xmath3-partite greenberger - horn - zeilinger state ( section iv ) .",
    "we also analyse a very specific eigenstate of the ising hamiltonian with a zero eigenenergy ( we denote this eigenstate as the @xmath4-state ) .",
    "this @xmath4-state exhibits extreme entanglement in a sense that a arbitrary subset @xmath5 of @xmath6 qubits in the ising chain composed of @xmath7 qubits is maximally entangled with the remaining qubits ( set @xmath8 ) in the chain .",
    "in addition we prove that by performing local operation just on the subset @xmath8 one can transform the @xmath4 state into a direct product of @xmath9 singlets shared by the parties @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "this property of the @xmath4 state can be utilised for new secure multi - partite communication protocols .",
    "technical details of some of our calculations are presented in appendices .",
    "we consider a model of a linear chain of spin one - half particles forming a circle , placed in a magnetic field where only the z - component of the field is non - zero .",
    "since we are interested in the spin degrees of freedom only , the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 are well known pauli operators .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian is the interaction term with coupling constant @xmath12 and the second term corresponds to a free hamiltonian . the lower index @xmath13 labels the position of a spin in the chain and @xmath14 is the overall number of particles .",
    "the cyclic boundary conditions @xmath15 ensure that the chain forms a circle .",
    "the form of the interaction is chosen such that each particle interacts only with its two nearest neighbours .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 6.1.1 ] ) can be rewritten into a form which is more convenient for numerical calculations :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "now , instead of two parameters in energy units ( @xmath8 and @xmath19 ) we have one dimensionless parameter @xmath0 and one parameter in energy units , @xmath20 , that can be neglected in our further calculations except for the investigation of entanglement in gibbs states ( see section [ s6.2.3 ] ) .      in this paper we will use three different measures  the concurrence , the tangle and a measure of an intrinsic three - partite entanglement .",

    "the matrix @xmath22 has four non - negative eigenvalues @xmath23 that are written in a descending order ( i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 is a spin - flipped version of density matrix @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath26 . the concurrence is given by the relation @xmath27 ; 0\\right\\ } \\ ; .\\ ] ] let us point out that the state @xmath21 is arbitrary , that is , the concurrence is a valid measure of entanglement for two - qubit mixed states as well .",
    "the minimal value of the concurrence is zero ( in this case two qubit states are prepared in a separable state ) , while for any @xmath28 two qubits are entangled .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath29 corresponds to maximally entangled states that are locally unitary equivalent to bell states .",
    "it has been shown earlier that the concurrence is directly related to the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the tangle has been originally defined for pure states only .",
    "( there is an extension to mixed states but the extension is not computationally feasible except for the case of two qubits when the tangle is equal to the square of the concurrence ) .",
    "consider a multi - partite system where one of the subsystems , denoted @xmath5 , is a qubit .",
    "the tangle @xmath30 between a subsystem @xmath5 and the rest of the system , denoted as @xmath31 reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the reduced density operator describing a state of the subsystem @xmath5 .",
    "finally , the intrinsic three - qubit entanglement is defined for pure states only .",
    "consider a system composed of three qubits @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath34 and let the system of three qubits be in a pure state . with the help of the tangle and concurrence introduced above we can define pure three - partite entanglement @xmath35 in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been proven that the definition ( [ 3.4.3.3 ] ) of intrinsic three - qubit entanglement is independent of permutations of particles and shares all properties that a proper measure of entanglement has to fulfil .",
    "finally , let us mention that measures of entanglement are not unique and different measures might result in different ordering of states . for the case of bipartite systems @xmath36 prepared in a pure state the measure of entanglement",
    "is in fact any suitable function of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of either of the two subsystems @xmath33 or @xmath37 ref .",
    "for example the well known von neumann entropy @xmath38 defines a bipartite measure of entanglement usable for arbitrarily dimensional systems .",
    "in order to understand entanglement properties of the ising chain under consideration it makes sense to start with a relatively simple example of three spin-1/2 particles ( qubits ) .",
    "even this simple system exhibits interesting properties and their understanding will guide us in general case of an arbitrary number of qubits .",
    "the ising hamiltonian with three spin-1/2 particles can be directly diagonalized and energy levels easily calculated . in what follows , we will call spin-1/2 particles as qubits since the hilbert space @xmath39 of a spin one - half particle is two - dimensional .",
    "let us note that the simplest example is the case of two qubits , that is @xmath40 .",
    "however , this trivial example has already been investigated in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the case of three qubits is also interesting on account of the fact that , besides intrinsic bipartite entanglement , three qubits can also share three - partite entanglement . in the case of three qubits being in a pure state this intrinsic three - qubit entanglement can be easily calculated with the help of eq .",
    "( [ 3.4.3.3 ] ) .",

    "( [ 6.1.3 ] ) of the ising model with only three qubits in the chain reads @xmath41 note that the hamiltonian @xmath42 is permutationally invariant , unlike the hamiltonians @xmath43 for @xmath44 qubits .",

    "( [ 3.4.3.3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "due to the fact that any non - degenerate state shares all symmetries of the corresponding hamiltonian , the entanglement of the ground state between an arbitrary pair of qubits has the same dependence on the parameter @xmath0 and it holds that @xmath72 moreover , the same holds for bipartite entanglement between a given qubit and the rest of the system so that @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes a system of two qubits with the qubit on the @xmath4-th position omitted and @xmath75 is the entanglement shared between the qubit on the @xmath4-th position and the rest of the ising chain ( remaining two qubits ) .    the solid line in the picture fig .",
    "[ obr - n3zs ] shows bipartite entanglement between an arbitrary pair of qubits .",
    "for @xmath76 the concurrence , i.e. the pairwise entanglement is zero .",
    "as @xmath77 it means that the case @xmath76 corresponds to the absence of the interaction , @xmath78 .",
    "consequently , the ground state of the system is such that all spins are aligned along the same direction , the direction of the magnetic field , and are not entangled .",
    "when we turn on the interaction , the constant @xmath19 is no longer zero and the spins become entangled .",
    "as we increase the value of the interaction constant @xmath19 ( or equivalently decrease the value of the magnetic field @xmath8 so that the ratio @xmath79 increases ) the qubits become more and more entangled .",
    "this holds up to the value of @xmath1 where the two qubit entanglement reaches its maximum .",
    "further increase of the parameter @xmath19 ( or decrease of @xmath8 ) causes degradation of the entanglement and in the limit @xmath0 goes to infinity the entanglement is zero . as we have chosen the ground state for @xmath80 to be the limit of the ground state when @xmath0 tends to infinity , the concurrence at the point @xmath80 is zero .",
    "it means that when the magnetic field is zero , the ground state of the system is such that all pair concurrencies are zero and there is no entanglement in any pair of qubits .",
    "the entanglement of a given qubit @xmath4 and the rest of the system @xmath74 expressed in terms of the tangle is , on contrary , a non - decreasing function of @xmath0 . at the point",
    "@xmath76 the entanglement is zero on account of the same reason as the entanglement between an arbitrary pair of qubits . when the parameter @xmath0 is non - zero ( i.e. the interaction constant @xmath19 is non - zero ) the qubits are entangled .",

    "the stronger the interaction ( the larger the value of the parameter @xmath0 ) , the stronger the qubits are entangled with the system . in the limit @xmath81 ( infinitely strong interaction ) the qubits become maximally entangled and the tangle , measuring the amount of entanglement between a given qubit and remaining two qubits , reaches its maximum value .",
    "for the case of our specific choice of the ground state for @xmath80 the tangle is maximal and equals to unity .",
    "as we have already pointed out the reason why we have described the case of three qubits in such detail is that the entanglement behaves in the same manner for an arbitrarily large @xmath3 .",
    "but the case of three qubits is special for a different reason too . in the case of just three qubits being in a pure state",
    "we are able to calculate the intrinsic three - partite entanglement using eq .",
    "( [ 3.4.3.3 ] ) . the dashed line in the fig .",
    "[ obr - n3zs ] shows the dependence of the three - qubit entanglement on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we can see that the dependence of the intrinsic three - partite entanglement on the parameter @xmath0 is very similar to the dependence on the same parameter of the entanglement between a given qubit and remaining two qubits ( fig .",
    "[ obr - n3zs ] ) .",
    "it seems that for a strong interaction the three - partite entanglement is the largest contribution provided we express the entanglement between a single qubit and remaining two qubits ( rest of the system ) as a sum of two and three - qubit entanglement ( see eq .  ( [ 3.4.3.3 ] ) and comments therein ) .",
    "this result suggests the following physical picture : _",
    "`` when the system of interacting spin-1/2 particles is in the ground state then the interaction causes entanglement of qubits such that each qubit is entangled with the rest of the system . for the system of @xmath3 spin-1/2 particles",
    "the @xmath3-partite entanglement will be dominant when the interaction between the particles is very strong compared to the magnitude of the magnetic field . ''",
    "_ this conjecture , proven to be valid in the case of three qubits , will be further examined in following sections where the general case of a chain with an arbitrary number of qubit will be analysed .      in this subsection",
    "we will continue to investigate the 3-qubit ising model .",
    "we will analyse the entanglement properties of thermal states of three qubits interacting according to the ising hamiltonian .",
    "the ground state of the system is probably the most important state and through the study of those states we acquire a lot of information about the corresponding system itself . beside being the states with the lowest energy",
    "we know that the ground states are associated with zero temperature and that they are related to fundamental properties of hamiltonians . however , there are other states which are equally relevant for the physical description of the system .",
    "the temperature of a system we measure in our laboratories is always non - zero .",
    "keeping in mind the third law of thermodynamics and the impossibility of reaching the absolute zero temperature we can conclude that in practice there is always a non - zero probability for finding the system under study in one of the excited states . of course , the probability depends on the temperature but as far as the temperature is non - zero , no matter how big the gap in the energy between the ground state and the first excited state is , the probability is non - zero as well .",
    "consequently , it is interesting to study entanglement in systems in thermal equilibrium , i.e. in their `` natural '' state , and investigate the dependence of the entanglement on temperature .",
