    "the asymmetric bwf lineshapes in graphite - related systems are normally found in the raman shift around @xmath10 , known as the @xmath11 modes , which correspond to two zone - center ( @xmath12 ) phonon modes , namely the in - plane tangential optic ( ito ) and longitudinal optic modes . in graphene , the bwf asymmetry of the @xmath11 band is observed using the gate - modulated raman spectroscopy .",

    "@xcite unlike the previous calculation for m - swnts which utilized exciton wavefunctions ,  @xcite in this calculation we use electron wavefunctions from the tight binding ( tb ) method because our calculation regime ( @xmath18 ev ) is far from the saddle point energy dispersion ( @xmath19 ev ) , and thus the exciton effects are negligible .",

    "the coulomb interaction between the pe and the des causes the pe to reduce its energy and changes pe s momentum while the des are being excited .",
    "the number of des to be excited for each process depends on the number of the scattering order . in the first - order process , only one de is excited and this process requires a zero momentum transfer ( @xmath27 ) since the pe momentum ( @xmath28 ) should be the same as its hole momentum in order to emit a scattered photon with energy @xmath26 by the electron - hole recombination process . in the second - order process , on the other hand , the pe is scattered twice ( @xmath29 ) and ( @xmath30 ) and the pe excites two des with relative non - zero electron - hole momenta @xmath31 and @xmath32 . due to the degeneracy of the dirac cone at the @xmath33 and @xmath34 points of the graphene brillouin zone ( bz ) ,",
    "both the first - order processes and the second - order processes may occur in the intravalley ( a ) interactions or in the intervalley ( e ) interactions . in the a interactions ,",
