    "a jet origin of the x - ray emission of microquasars has previously been suggested by several authors , e.g. , @xcite , who discussed the possibility of synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the jet extending from the radio all the way into the x - ray regime .",

    "detection of such variability behavior , particularly if correlated with @xmath0-ray flaring behavior as described here , would provide evidence in favor of leptonic models .",
    "whereas previous studies have largely focused on spectral fits to the broadband emission of microquasars in a steady - state approximation , we have focused on the spectral variability features expected in generic microquasar jet models with electron injection and/or acceleration over a limited amount of time and length along the jet , representative of , e.g. , internal - shock models .",

    "unfortunately , such detailed snapshot broadband spectra are currently not available , and might not be available in the near future .",
    "therefore , we have exposed several other features pertinent to the transition between different spectral components which will be more easily observable in realistic observational data of microquasars :    * a sudden increase of a light curve slope at a fixed observing frequency , not accompanied by significant flaring activity at other wavelengths , usually indicates the passing of a new spectral component through the fixed observing frequency range .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such a representation , possible hysteresis on short ( intraday ) time scales are very hard to identify .",
