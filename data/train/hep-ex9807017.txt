    "the photon is not a hadron  it has fundamental direct couplings to all charged particles - _ except _ when it has already turned into a hadron before it interacts , see figure  [ fig : graph ] .",
    "this duality gives rise to a wide range of phenomena that test both the perturbative and non - perturbative parts of qcd .",
    "current experiments at lep and cleo ii at cornell are improving our understanding of photon structure and the properties of gamma - gamma resonances .",
    "r9.0 cm    figure  [ fig : tag ] shows the generic feynman graph for all @xmath1 processes at an @xmath2 collider .",
    "it is labelled to show one of the scattered beam leptons as a `` tagged '' and measured final state particle .",
    "the results which follow come from untagged events as well as this singly tagged case . if a scattered lepton is tagged then its four momentum transfer is usually well measured , and we define @xmath3 .",
    "if a scattered lepton is untagged then we know that its scattering angle was less than a few tens of milliradians and that @xmath4 .    r6.8 cm    the invariant mass @xmath5 can sometimes be well measured  if all the final state particles are caught by the detector .",
    "but in multihadron final states some of the particles are often missed , which means that both @xmath5 and the bjorken scaling variable @xmath6 will be badly measured , and biased .",
    "there is no alternative way of determining @xmath5 from the initial state kinematics , as can be done for @xmath7 in electron - proton scattering at hera , because both virtual @xmath8s are drawn from broad bremsstrahlung - like spectra .",
    "virtual photon beams bring two other disadvantages : + i ) the bulk of the @xmath1 cross section is at very low values of @xmath5  @xcite so the effective luminosity for high energy processes is much less than at hera .",
    "+ ii ) the longitudinal momenta of the two colliding photons are usually unequal , giving a strong boost along the beam direction to the final state and accentuating the loss of particles from the well - measured region .",
    "the prospect of eventually producing `` narrow band '' beams of real photons by compton backscattering at a future linear collider has been extensively discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "such a facility would raise the effective luminosity for interesting hard processes to at least the level of the @xmath9 luminosity at hera , with a significant part of the spectrum within 10% of the peak value of @xmath10 .",
    "as well as allowing much of the physics discussed in the rest of this review to be done with better precision , a high energy `` compton collider '' could give important access to properties of higgs and susy particles which could not be seen in other ways and would extend the range of constraints on the triple - gauge - boson couplings .",
    "a low energy compton collider would be a unique facility for the study of meson resonances , certainly up to around the @xmath11 , may even allow a chance to see the @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section for singly tagged processes is  @xcite @xmath13    this has been integrated over the azimuthal angle of the unseen scattered lepton .",
    "the second scaling variable @xmath14 is much less than 1 if the threshold for the tagged electron is set at more than half the beam energy , as it normally must be at lep to eliminate beam - associated background from the collider , so the @xmath15 contribution is expected to be unmeasurably small  @xcite .",
    "the main part of @xmath16 deep inelastic scattering is therefore driven by the structure function @xmath17 .",
    "all of the lep experiments have confirmed the predicted shape and size of @xmath18 in the singly - tagged @xmath19 process  @xcite , figure  [ fig : f2qed ] .",
    "a recent l3 result  @xcite even claims to see signs of the slight reduction in rate expected because the average value of @xmath20 is not exactly zero if the second tagged electron is only vetoed down to about 35 milliradians from the beam direction .",
    "the universality of the tau coupling has been checked  @xcite .",
    "l3 has also measured the rates for untagged @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "an intriguing set of studies by three of the lep experiments  @xcite has also confirmed qed predictions for a pair of more subtle structure functions , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which relate to the azimuthal angle @xmath26 between the plane of the tagged electron and the plane of the two outgoing muons in the @xmath1 c. of m. , see figure  [ fig : tagplane ] . @xmath27 multiplies the @xmath28 dependence and comes from the interference between longitudinal and transverse photon scattering . @xmath29 multiplies @xmath30 and is a transverse - transverse term .",
    "r5.6 cm    apart from an apparent disagreement on sign conventions - an easy problem for the lep inter - experiment @xmath1 working group to sort out - the results agree with each other and with qed predictions .",
    "measurement of @xmath24 and @xmath25 is interesting , not because it tests qed but because it proves that such measurements are possible at lep .",
    "the challenge now is to do the same thing with hadronic final states , using the plane of pairs of jets to define the plane of the outgoing quarks instead of the dimuon plane .",
    "qcd calculations of @xmath27 and @xmath29 involve many of the same operators as calculations of the unmeasurable @xmath31 , which is expected to scale at lowest order in qcd .",
    "r8.3 cm    this classic test of qcd  @xcite has been complicated by both theoretical and experimental problems .",
    "the theoretical picture is complicated by the dual nature of the photon . a purely perturbative treatment",
    ", starting from the direct @xmath34 coupling , gives singularities at low @xmath35 .",
    "these can be dealt with by including the pre - existent hadronic part of the photon , but the predictive power of qcd is then severely undermined by the need for a nonperturbative description of the parton distribution in the initial object  usually taken to be a vector meson with parton structure similar to that of the pion .",
    "r8.3 cm    nevertheless , it has been argued  @xcite that some sensitivity to the qcd evolution of the direct coupling does remain if measurements can be made over a wide range of @xmath33 .",
    "the lep experiments  @xcite are making progress in measuring @xmath32 ( figure  [ fig : f2qcd ] ) , and in seeing its expected nonscaling growth with @xmath36 ( figure  [ fig : f2vsq2 ] ) , but the error bars are enormous compared with those for @xmath37 from hera , from slac or from muon beams .",
    "this is partly statistical , due to the softness of the virtual photon spectrum at lep , but the major part of the error is systematic , due to uncertainties in reconstructing the mass @xmath5 of the hadronic final state .",
    "the lep detectors have good hadron tracking out to a pseudorapidity @xmath38 , but beyond that they only have electromagnetic calorimetry which samples the hadronic final state but does not measure all of the hadronic energy .",
    "it is therefore necessary to rely upon monte carlo simulation in an unfolding procedure  @xcite which corrects for the distorted @xmath35 distribution caused by the biased measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "different monte carlo programs  @xcite give very different forward energy flows ( figure  [ fig : eflow]a and b ) , so correlations ( figure  [ fig : wwvis ] ) between the observed @xmath39 and the true value of @xmath40 depend upon both whether the forward detector hadronic energy is sampled at all ( `` without fd '' , `` with fd '' ) and which monte carlo is used .",
    "the experimental error bars in figures  [ fig : f2qcd ] and  [ fig : f2vsq2 ] are dictated primarily by the choice of the set of monte carlo programs used for input to the unfolding .",
    "r7.6 cm    the all - lep working group is making good progress on improving this situation .",
    "better monte carlo generators are being provided  though there is always a danger here  @xcite .",
    "many generators assume a particular parameterisation of the parton density functions inside the photon . if the parton - showering part of such a program is tuned to fit data like that in figure  [ fig : eflow]a ) , then there is a chance that the unfolded @xmath41 will not be independent from the assumed parameterisation .",
    "fortunately , new techniques are also being devised which will make the final unfolded result less sensitive to the particular monte carlo used .    at large values of @xmath33 the measured hadronic energy flow ( figure  [ fig : eflow]b ) is much better described because the hadrons recoil against the larger transverse momentum of the tagged electron ,",
    "so a larger fraction of them is caught by the central trackers .",
    "but at high @xmath33 and high @xmath35 there is another problem  the treatment of the charm mass , both in the monte carlo models and in the published parton density functions  @xcite .",
    "some treat charm as massless but impose a sudden threshold cut , giving a totally unphysical sharp edge in @xmath42 .",
    "some take @xmath43 , others have @xmath44 . at the highest @xmath35 values",
    "there may also be difficulties with simple factorisation of the effective @xmath1 luminosity .",
    "this must all be sorted out before we can deliver the final lep measurement of the @xmath33 evolution .",
    "lep should generate three times more luminosity in 19982000 than has yet been analysed for photon structure by any single experiment .",
    "it will be at higher energies  giving an increased reach in @xmath33  and the four lep experiments are collaborating well in understanding the problems so that their eventual results may be combined safely . assuming we can beat down the systematic errors to match these statistics",
    "then a definitive measurement of the @xmath33 evolution should be possible",
    ". it may even be possible to extract a new value of @xmath45 , though probably only within the framework of a particular parameterisation of @xmath32 like grv or sas . to get",
    "a truly model independent measurement may require the compton collider  @xcite .",
    "r8.2 cm    the rise of @xmath46 at low @xmath35 , as seen at hera  @xcite , has been shown to follow from normal dglap evolution  @xcite , with no need to invoke bfkl theory  @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious that the photon should behave in the same way , because of its dual  direct plus hadronic  nature .",
    "but the grv parameterisation of the photonic parton densities does predict a very similar rise of @xmath32 at low @xmath35 .",
    "the lep1 results for @xmath47 ( figure  [ fig : lowx ] ) are not in conflict with this .",
    "the more recent l3 result may appear to contradict opal  @xcite , but this is just another manifestation of the problem of unfolding @xmath5 , discussed above .",
    "when l3 uses the same herwig monte carlo as used in the opal unfolding they get similar values of @xmath32 .",
    "the errors shown on both the opal and the l3 points are predominantly systematic and the difference between them merely reflects different choices from the range of available unfolding monte carlos .",
    "both experiments disagree with the much lower values of @xmath32 found in this region by the @xmath48 experiment  @xcite .",
    "one should not , therefore , worry too much about the fact that the grv curves are lower than the lep points , since grv was constrained by the @xmath48 data  all that was then available .",
    "no new data can be expected from lep2 in this low @xmath33 region .",
    "both opal and l3 used their small - angle luminometers to tag the electrons in these events , and the definition of @xmath33 , above , tells us that at fixed @xmath49 the mean value of @xmath50 .",
    "so a definite statement about the low @xmath35 rise of @xmath32 is not waiting for new data .",
    "it is waiting for the all - lep working group to sort out the @xmath5 monte carlo modelling and unfolding problem so that we can reduce the systematic errors ; very likely without much movement of the points already plotted in figures  [ fig : f2qcd ] and  [ fig : lowx ] .",
    "singly tagged @xmath16 scattering can never give direct measurements of the distributions of uncharged partons like gluons .",
    "the only published attempts at a direct unfolding of @xmath51 come from h1  @xcite , using the distributions of high-@xmath52 hadrons in photoproduction .",
    "but the error bars are even larger than for the lep measurements of @xmath32 , and there is a fundamental problem with the method because the sample is contaminated by hadrons from `` underlying events '' in which there are interactions of other partons from the colliding proton and target photon .",
    "the uncertainty generated by such multiple interactions is the main reason why zeus has never attempted such an unfolding  @xcite .",
    "groups at both hera  @xcite and lep are making progress in testing the parameterisations of @xmath53 by studying the properties of high @xmath54 dijets as a function of variously defined `` @xmath55 '' variables . a recent opal analysis of lep2 data  @xcite uses an untagged @xmath1 sample , with",
    "two identified high @xmath54 jets in which they define @xmath56 and @xmath57 according to the formulae on figure  [ fig : scat ] . for direct coupling of the two photons to two quarks ( figure  [ fig : scat]a )",
    "we expect all of the hadrons to be in just two hard quark jets , so @xmath56 and @xmath57 should both be close to 1 . in a singly resolved event  @xcite there should be undetected hadronic momentum going into the forward region at one end of the detector , due to the unscattered remnant of the resolved photon ( figure  [ fig : scat]b ) , so one or other of @xmath56 or @xmath57 should be significantly less than 1 .",
    "in doubly resolved events ( figure  [ fig : scat]c ) ) unscattered photon remnants will go into both forward regions , therefore both @xmath56 and @xmath57 should be much less than 1 .",
    "this picture is well confirmed , at least in the framework of the pythia monte carlo program which allows events to be identified as coming from direct , singly resolved or doubly resolved processes ( figure  [ fig : scat]d ) . by making cuts on both of @xmath58 or one of @xmath59 in the real data ,",
    "opal has separated a `` direct '' and a `` resolved '' sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : angular ] shows the angular distributions in the dijet c. of m. for the two samples , compared with the predictions of various parton - parton scattering processes which match the `` resolved '' category , or of simple @xmath60 which matches the `` direct '' events .",
    "this work confirms the qualitative predictions of qcd , but the similarity of the different sub - processes in the resolved case is too close to give a measure of the gluon content .",
    "a more quantitative test has been made by using various parton density functions with the pythia and phojet monte carlo models to predict the differential jet - pseudorapidity distributions in high @xmath54 dijet events , figure  [ fig : dijet ] . but here again , as in the h1 attempt to unfold the gluon density , including the effects of multiple interactions ( labelled `` mi '' ) makes a big difference , especially to the lac1 case where the amount of glue in the photon is largest .",
    "r8.4 cm    two lep2 untagged @xmath1 analyses confirm the qcd picture , and may eventually allow a measurement of the glue .",
    "in the first , l3 has used high @xmath52 final state leptons to measure the inclusive charm production rate  @xcite , extending the work of the tristan experiments and of aleph at lep1 up to higher energies , figure  [ fig : charm ] .",
    "the results can only be explained by including a large resolved contribution which grows with energy , as predicted by krmer et al .",
    "@xcite deducing the precise amount of glue in the photon from this is difficult because , yet again , we do not know what value of @xmath61 to use  hence the two lines for the `` qcd '' case which straddle most of the data points . in the second , the @xmath62 distributions from opal s dijet analysis have been compared with the predictions of a parton - level nlo calculation @xcite .",
    "again , the resolved components are essential to explain the data .",
    "the special nature of the photon shows up again in the opal  @xcite data of figure  [ fig : wa69 ] , where the transverse momentum distributions of individual hadrons are shown for three different initial states ; @xmath1 , @xmath9 and @xmath63 , all at the same c. of m. energy .",
    "the distributions have been normalised to the same value at low @xmath52 .",
    "they look very similar in the soft region with @xmath64 , but the @xmath1 data then diverge very markedly from the other two , perhaps the clearest evidence yet for the direct @xmath65 process .",
    "checks from the other lep experiments and comparisons from hera are needed .",
    "this has always been the most difficult number to measure in @xmath1 physics .",
    "figures  [ fig : eflow]a ) and b ) above demonstrate for tagged events how the hadronic energy flow tends to go more and more forward , out of the efficient part of the detector , as the momentum transfer from the scattered electron and positron decreases .",
    "but the biggest contribution to the total cross section is from untagged events where both parent leptons are forward scattered and go down the beampipe , undetected , with @xmath67 . and",
    "when both photons are close to the mass shell we expect a larger contribution from soft hadron - hadron scattering ; diffractive processes with low @xmath52 final state hadrons which will mostly go into the badly measured regions . this diffractive component must include the `` elastic scattering '' of the vector - meson - dominated photon , @xmath68 , though no one has yet succeeded in detecting it at small angles at lep .",
    "( the analogous @xmath69 channel has been seen at hera and behaves just as vector dominance and regge factorisation would predict . )",
    "r8.6 cm    extraction of @xmath66 depends even more heavily upon unfolding than does the measurement of @xmath70 described in section 2.1 above . and",
    "the monte carlo programs that have to be used as input to the unfolding again differ seriously from one another .",
    "opal sees particularly big differences between predictions from phojet and pythia of the fraction of diffractive plus elastic events .",
    "given the difficulties , it is not surprising that the first lep measurements , from opal ( preliminary  @xcite ) and l3 ( published  @xcite and preliminary  @xcite ) disagree with one another , figure  [ fig : totx ] . though the lep measurements already agree better than did experiments at lower energy .",
    "note that , because of unfolding , the lep points at neighbouring values of @xmath5 are very highly correlated .",
    "note also that the two l3 results are significantly different from one another at low values of @xmath5 .",
    "systematic errors dominate , and are estimated by comparing the effects of unfolding with different monte carlo generators .",
    "opal reports that no generator has yet been found which correctly predicts the observed multiplicity distribution of hadrons , especially for low numbers of hadrons where the diffractive contribution should be important .",
    "the message to theorists who want to use these results is that the spread of the data is a good indicator of the systematic errors , for the moment .",
    "getting these errors down looks like a harder job for the all - lep working group than sorting out @xmath71 .",
    "one thing which both the opal and the l3 results have in common is a significant rise of @xmath66 between @xmath72 and @xmath73 . this rise is steeper than the simple factorisation prediction , labelled @xmath74 on figure  [ fig : totx]a ) , based on the published zeus and h1 values for @xmath75 .",
    "but a recent zeus thesis  @xcite has extrapolated very low @xmath33 photoproduction cross sections to @xmath76 .",
    "the resulting estimates of the total cross section are significantly higher than the published values , and they rise faster with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "this @xmath9 evidence , together with the opal and l3 data on @xmath77 , suggests that the total cross sections involving incoming photons are different from purely hadronic total cross sections . in the familiar parameterisation  @xcite @xmath78 fredj",
    "@xcite has shown that the average of the opal and l3 results for @xmath77 needs a larger exponent ( @xmath79 ) than the accepted value ( @xmath80 ) which fits all hadronic total cross sections .",
    "all of the lep experiments are equipped with small calorimeters beyond the first mini - beta quadrupole , capable of tagging at at finite values , @xmath82 , of the virtuality of the target photon .",
    "rates at lep1 for doubly tagged events were too low to be worthwhile ( with only @xmath83 of integrated luminosity ) , but preliminary tests at lep2 are promising , and there are likely to be worthwhile measurements ( with up to @xmath84 ) of the amount by which @xmath85 is suppressed at finite @xmath20 .",
    "others are searching for double tags at larger angles , looking for bfkl effects  @xcite .",
    "no clear results have yet been reported .",
    "cleo ii has already collected more than @xmath87 integrated luminosity , and the beauty factory experiments babar and belle expect even more . despite their disadvantage in energy compared with lep they will always have access to larger samples of @xmath88 , at least up to @xmath89 , and their final state hadrons are better measured because they are not as strongly boosted along the beam direction as often happens at lep .",
    "so far cleo",
    "ii has published a few gems from its great treasure of data , and the lep experiments have checked some of them .",
    "cleo ii s measurement of the partial width",
    "@xmath90  @xcite agrees with l3 and with the radically different fermilab e760 measurement that uses @xmath91 .",
    "but the e760 value  @xcite for @xmath92 is significantly smaller than the values of around @xmath93 measured by cleo ii and l3  @xcite .",
    "both sides need to look again at their systematic errors .",
    "the `` stickiness '' @xmath94 of a resonance x is defined as the phase - space weighted ratio of @xmath95 to @xmath96 .",
    "glueballs should be produced copiously in radiative @xmath97 decays , but should not couple directly to @xmath1 .",
    "for one particular glueball candidate , the @xmath98 , cleo ii sees absolutely no signal , and has reported  @xcite a lower limit @xmath99  the highest ever measured .",
    "l3 also sees no sign of this resonance in @xmath1 , but with much lower significance  @xcite .",
    "cleo ii has also reported  @xcite singly tagged production of the three pseudoscalar mesons , @xmath100 , @xmath101 or @xmath102 . the @xmath33 dependence is predicted to depend upon a dipole form factor , whose shape can be fitted to give an effective mass for the exchanged virtual vector meson .",
    "cleo obtains two roughly equal values of the dipole mass , respectively @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 and @xmath101 production , but a significantly larger value of @xmath106 for the @xmath102 ( l3 report @xmath107 for the @xmath102  @xcite ) .",
    "the size of the form factor at large @xmath33 can be predicted from perturbative qcd models , assuming the @xmath108 wave function of the meson . for @xmath109 and @xmath101",
    "the value fits the simplest model already at @xmath110 , but the @xmath102 form factor is about twice the size predicted by the model .",
    "theorists  @xcite have suggested that this disagreement with pqcd , together with the higher dipole mass for the @xmath102 , mean that its wavefunction must be more complicated than those of the lighter psuedoscalars",
