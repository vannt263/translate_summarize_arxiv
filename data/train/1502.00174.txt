    "equilibrium problems play an important role in nonlinear analysis especially because they provide a unified framework for treating optimization problems , fixed points , saddle points as well as many important problems in physics and mathematical economics , such as location problems or nash equilibria in game theory .",
    "the foundation of ( scalar ) equilibrium theory has been laid down by ky fan @xcite , his minimax inequality still being considered one of the most notable results in this field .",
    "the classical scalar equilibrium problem @xcite , described by a bifunction @xmath0 , consists in finding @xmath1 such that @xmath2    we recall the famous existence result of ky fan .

    "these vector equilibrium problems , much like their scalar counterpart , offer a unified framework for treating vector optimization , vector variational inequalities or cone saddle point problems , to name just a few @xcite .",

    "the following equilibrium problem , called strong vector equilibrium problem @xcite , is also a valid extension of the scalar equilibrium problem to vector valued case . in the formulation of the strong vector equilibrium problem",
    "we do not assume the nonemptyness of the interior of the cone @xmath19    the strong vector equilibrium problem consists in finding @xmath1 , such that @xmath20    it can easily be observed , that for @xmath21 and @xmath22 the previous problems reduce to the classical scalar equilibrium problem .",

    "also the diagonal property @xmath26 respectively @xmath27 is assumed on a self - segment - dense set @xmath28 only .",
    "we pay a special attention to the case when @xmath3 is not necessarily compact but closed , in particular , when @xmath3 is a closed subset of a reflexive banach space .",
