    "we observed that the criterion works well , detecting quantum non - gaussianity in the non - trivial region of the noise parameters where no negativity of the wigner function can be observed .",
    "we have also shown how the criterion can be generalized and improved , by optimising over additional gaussian operations applied to the states of interest .",
    "notice that in a possible experimental implementation one does not need to perform such additional gaussian operations , such as displacement or squeezing , in the actual experiment .",
    "indeed , it suffices to use the data obtained on the state itself , and then apply suitable post - processing to evaluate the optimized non - gaussianity indicator .",
    "our criterion , which expresses a sufficient condition for quantum non - gaussianity , shares some similarities with hudson s theorem for pure gaussian states , in the sense that it establishes a relationship between the concept of gaussianity ( combined with classical mixing ) , and the possible values that a wigner function can take .",
    "the successful implementation of our criteria corresponds to the measurement of the wigner function at the origin of the phase space which , in turn , corresponds to the ( photon ) parity of the state under investigation .",
    "this may be obtained with current technology by direct parity measurement @xcite , or by reconstruction of the photon distribution either by tomographic reconstruction or by the on / off method @xcite . when the criterion is satisfied",
    ", one can confirm that the quantum state at disposal has been generated by means of a highly non - linear process , even in the cases where , perhaps due to inefficient detectors or other types of noise , negativity of the wigner function can not be detected .",
