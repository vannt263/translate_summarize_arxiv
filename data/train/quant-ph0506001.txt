    "commitment schemes are powerful cryptographic primitives . in a bit commitment scheme @xmath0 ,",
    "the committer is supposed to commit a bit @xmath3 to @xmath1 in such a way that after the _ commit phase _ she can not change her choice of the committed bit .",
    "this is referred to as the binding property .",
    "also at this stage @xmath1 should not be able to figure out what the committed bit is .",
    "this is referred to as the concealing property . later in the",
    "_ reveal phase _",
    "@xmath0 is supposed to reveal the bit @xmath4 and convince @xmath1 that this was indeed the bit which she committed earlier .",
    "bit commitment schemes have been very well studied in both the classical and quantum models since existence of such schemes imply several interesting results in cryptography . it has been shown that bit commitment schemes imply existence of _ quantum oblivious transfer _",
    "@xcite which in turn provides a way to do any two - party secure computation  @xcite .",
    "they are also useful in constructing _ zero knowledge proofs _",
    "@xcite and imply another very useful cryptographic primitive called secure _ coin tossing _  @xcite .",
    "but unfortunately strong negative results are known about them in case @xmath0 and @xmath1 are assumed to possess arbitrary computation power and information theoretic security is required . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with this setting of information theoretic security with unbounded computational resources with cheating parties .",
    "classically bit commitment schemes are known to be impossible . in the quantum setting several schemes were proposed but later several impossibility results were shown  @xcite .",
    "negative results were also shown for approximate implementations of bit commitment schemes  @xcite in which trade - offs were shown for cheating probabilities of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , referred to as binding - concealing trade - offs .",
    "interestingly however kent  @xcite has exhibited that bit - commitment can be achieved using relativistic constraints .",
    "however we point out that in this work we do not keep considerations of relativity into picture and our setting is non - relativistic .",
    "now suppose instead of wanting to commit a bit @xmath5 , @xmath0 wants to commit an entire string @xmath6 .",
    "one way to do this might be to commit all the bits of @xmath7 separately .",
    "binding - concealing trade - offs of such schemes will be limited by the binding - concealing trade - offs allowable for bit commitment schemes .",
    "but it is conceivable that there might exist cleverer schemes which allow for better binding and concealing properties ?",
    "this question was originally raised by kent  @xcite .",
    "let us first begin by formally defining a quantum string commitment protocol .",
    "our definition is similar to the one considered by buhrman et al .",
    "@xcite    [ def : qsc ] let @xmath8 be a probability distribution and let @xmath9 be a _ measure of information _",
    "( we define several measures of information later ) .",
    "a @xmath10 protocol for @xmath11 is a _ quantum communication protocol  @xcite _ between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0 gets an input @xmath12 ( chosen according to the distribution @xmath11 ) , which is supposed to be the string to be committed .",
    "the starting joint state of the qubits of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is some pure state .",
    "there are no intermediate measurements during the protocol and @xmath1 has a final checking @xmath13 measurement @xmath14 ( please see sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] for definition of @xmath13 ) to determine the value of the committed string by @xmath0 or to detect her cheating .",
    "the protocol runs in two phases called the commit phase followed by the reveal phase .",
    "the following properties need to be satisfied .    1 .",
    "* ( correctness ) * let @xmath0 and @xmath1 act honestly .",
    "let @xmath15 be the state of @xmath1 s qubits at the end of the reveal phase of the protocol when @xmath0 gets input @xmath7",
    ". then @xmath16 iff @xmath17 and 0 otherwise .",
    "( concealing ) * let @xmath0 act honestly and @xmath1 be possibly cheating .",
    "let @xmath18 be the state of @xmath1 s qubits after the commit phase when @xmath0 gets input @xmath7 .",
    "then the @xmath9 information of the ensemble @xmath19 is at most @xmath4 . in particular",
    "this is also true for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 acting honestly .",
    "3 .   * ( binding ) * let @xmath1 act honestly and @xmath0 be possibly cheating .",
    "let @xmath20 be a string in a special cheating register @xmath21 with @xmath0 that she keeps independent of the rest of the registers till the end of the commit phase .",
    "let @xmath22 be the state of @xmath1 s qubits at the end of the reveal phase when @xmath0 has @xmath23 in the cheating register .",
    "let @xmath24 .",
    "then for all input strings @xmath7 , @xmath25    the idea behind the above definition is as follows .",
    "at the end of the reveal phase of an honest run of the protocol @xmath1 figures out @xmath7 from @xmath15 by performing the @xmath13 measurement @xmath26 .",
    "he accepts the committed string to be @xmath7 iff @xmath27 succeeds and this happens with probability @xmath28 .",
    "he declares @xmath0 cheating if @xmath29 succeeds .",
    "thus due to the first condition , at the end of an honest run of the protocol , @xmath1 accepts the committed string to be exactly the input string of @xmath0 with probability 1 .",
    "the second condition above takes care of the concealing property stating that the amount of @xmath9 information about @xmath7 that a possibly cheating @xmath1 gets is bounded by @xmath4 . in bit - commitment protocols ,",
    "the concealing property was quantified in terms of the probability with which @xmath1 can guess @xmath0 s bit .",
    "buhrman et al .",
    "@xcite in fact do consider @xmath1 s probability of guessing @xmath0 s input string as quantifying the concealing property .",
    "however in the proof of their trade - off result , they consider a related notion of information as a quantification of the concealing property . in this paper",
    ", we use various notions of information to quantify the concealing property of the protocol .",
    "the third condition guarantees the binding property .",
    "it makes sure that if a cheating @xmath0 wants to postpone committing or wants to change her choice at the end of the commit phase , then she can not succeed in making an honest @xmath1 accept her new choice with good probability , for a lot of different strings of her choice .",
    "a few points regarding the above definition are important to note .",
    "we assume that the combined state of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the beginning of the protocol is a pure state . given this assumption ,",
    "it can be assumed without loss of generality ( due to the arguments of  @xcite ) that it remains a pure state till the end of the protocol ( in an honest run ) .",
    "this is because @xmath0 and @xmath1 need not apply any intermediate measurements , before @xmath1 applies the final checking @xmath13 at the end of the protocol .",
    "our impossibility result makes a critical use of this fact and fails to hold if the starting combined state is not a pure state .",
    "however , there are no restrictions on the starting pure state shared between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , it could even be an entangled state between them .",
    "the impossibility result in  @xcite has also been shown under this assumption .",
    "this assumption has also been made in showing impossibility results for bit - commitment schemes  @xcite .",
    "the main reason why these arguments do not work , both for bit commitment and string commitment schemes , if the combined state is not a pure state is that the _ local transition theorem _ ( thm",
    ".  [ thm : loctrans ] mentioned later ) fails to hold for mixed states .",
    "it is conceivable that , and will be interesting to see if better @xmath2 schemes exist when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are forced ( by some third party say ) to start in some mixed state .",
    "please look at  @xcite for extension of impossibility results for bit - commitment to a very large class of protocols .      as we will see later , the notion of information used in the above definition is very important and therefore let us briefly define various notions of information that we will be concerned with in this paper .",
    "the following notion of information , referred to as the quantum mutual information or the holevo-@xmath30 information is one of the most commonly used .    given a quantum state @xmath31 , the _ von - neumann _ entropy of @xmath31",
    "is defined as @xmath32 .",

    "let @xmath38 be an ensemble and let @xmath39 be a classical random variable such that @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 , correlated with @xmath39 , be the classical random variable that represents the result of a @xmath13 measurement @xmath42 performed on @xmath43 .",
    "the _ accessible information _",
    "@xmath44 of the ensemble  @xmath43 is then defined to be @xmath45    as mentioned before buhrman et al .",
    "used @xmath1 s probability of guessing @xmath0 s input string as the measure of concealment of the protocol .",
    "however in the proofs of their impossibility result , they used the following notion of information .",
    "the @xmath46 information of an ensemble @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath50 be the probability that @xmath1 correctly guesses @xmath0 s input string @xmath7 ( with @xmath0 honest ) before the start of the reveal phase .",
    "@xcite showed that any @xmath51 protocol with @xmath52 , is also a @xmath53 protocol . hence their impossibility results for @xmath53 protocols implied same impossibility results for @xmath51 protocols with @xmath52 .    in this paper",
    "we also consider a notion of _ divergence information_. it is based on the following notion of distance between two quantum states , considered by jain , radhakrishnan and sen  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath33 be two quantum states .",
    "the observational divergence between them denoted @xmath54 , is defined as , @xmath55    the definition of divergence information of an ensemble is similar to the holevo-@xmath30 information except the notion of distance between quantum states used is now observational divergence instead of relative entropy .",
    "[ def : divinf ] let @xmath38 be an ensemble and let @xmath56 . its divergence information is defined @xmath57      the impossibility of a strong string commitment protocol , in which both @xmath58 are required to be 0 , is immediately implied by the impossibility of strong bit - commitment protocols .",
    "the question of a trade - off between @xmath59 and @xmath4 was studied by buhrman et al .",
    "they studied this trade - off both in the scenario of single execution of the protocol and also in the asymptotic regime with several parallel executions of the protocol . in the scenario of single execution of the protocol they showed the following result .",
    "[ thm : harrysingle ] for single execution of the protocol of a @xmath60-@xmath61-@xmath2 , @xmath62 .",
    "this then ( as argued before ) implied similar trade - off for a @xmath60-@xmath2 with @xmath52 ( where @xmath50 be the probability that @xmath1 correctly guesses @xmath0 s input string @xmath7 , with @xmath0 honest , before the start of the reveal phase . ) in the asymptotic regime they showed the following result in terms of the holevo-@xmath30 information .",

    "then , @xmath69 .",
    "there are two reason why thm .",
    "[ thm : avgasym ] may appear stronger than thm .",
    "[ thm : harrysingle ] .",
    "one because there is no additive constant and the other because for many ensembles @xmath43 , @xmath70 as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : separation ] .",
    "in fact , as we also show in sec .  [",
    "sec : separation ] , there exists ensembles @xmath43 for which @xmath71 is exponentially ( in @xmath72 ) larger than @xmath73 .    along with these impossibility results buhrman et al .",
    "interestingly also showed that if the measure of information considered is the accessible information , the above trade - offs no longer hold .",
    "for example there exists a @xmath2 scheme where @xmath74 and @xmath75 when measure of information is the accessible information .",
    "this therefore asserts that the choice of measure of information is crucial to ( im)possibility .",
    "previously kent  @xcite also exhibited trade - offs for some schemes on @xmath0 s probability of cheating and the amount of accessible information that @xmath1 gets about the committed string .",
    "however he did not allow @xmath0 to be arbitrarily cheating , in particular @xmath0 could not have started with a superposition of strings in the input register .",
    "therefore the schemes that he considered were truly not @xmath2s as we have defined them .",
    "we show the following binding - concealing trade - off for @xmath2s .",
