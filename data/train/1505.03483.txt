    "under the application of strong fields , electron transport becomes nonlinear and new effects arise : rectification @xcite , magnetic - field asymmetries@xcite , and the generation of higher harmonics @xcite .",

    "when @xmath1 depends weakly on the carrier s energy @xmath2 , current is always a linear function of @xmath3 independently of the background temperature @xmath4 .",
    "quite generally , however , transmission across nanostructures shows sharp features arising from strongly energy dependent @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , in the nonlinear regime of transport , the transmission becomes a function of the applied voltage @xmath3 because the applied field modifies the potential landscape which in turn affects the scattering properties of the sample @xcite .",
    "the self - consistent procedure must then include electron - electron interactions that restore current conservation and gauge invariance beyond linear response .",
    "in fact , it is the nontrivial dependence of the screening potential on voltage and magnetic fields that explains both rectification effects and magnetic - asymmetries , respectively .",
    "electron motion can also be induced with the application of external thermal gradients .",
    "the two main thermoelectric effects are the seebeck and peltier effects .",
    "the former leads to the creation of a voltage drop in response to a temperature difference @xmath5 in the open circuit case .",
    "the latter is based on the fact that electrons carry energy in addition to charge , and a heat current then flows in the presence of an electric current .",
    "both phenomena have been observed in mesoscopic systems @xcite , and the agreement with the scattering approach @xcite is remarkable . in these nanodevices ,",
