    "there has been much recent progress in the search for quantum condensed phases of quasiparticles in solids , such as bose - einstein condensates of excitons , polaritons , and magnons .",
    "a very interesting example@xcite occurs for electron bilayers in the quantum hall regime .",
    "when the two layers are close , and have individual filling factors @xmath0 , the coulomb interactions produce a ground state in which electrons in one layer are correlated with holes in the other .",
    "the wavefunction of this state is that of a bose - einstein condensate of interlayer excitons , and it exhibits behaviors reminiscent of superfluidity and the josephson effects : a small counterflow resistivity,@xcite which can be understood as excitonic superfluidity , and a zero - bias tunneling anomaly,@xcite which can be interpreted as a josephson effect .",
    "however , the analogy is incomplete , because neither the counterflow resistivity nor the width of the tunneling anomaly@xcite appears to vanish at finite temperatures .",
    "many theoretical works have suggested that these deviations from conventional superfluid behaviors are connected to the presence of vortices . in a quantum hall system",
    "physical and topological charges are related , so that random electric fields , created by the dopants , could induce vortices .",
    "the hypothesis that this leads to a disordered vortex state has been used@xcite to explain features such as the width of the tunneling anomaly and the region of negative differential conductance .",
    "more recently , fertig and collaborators have developed a strong - disorder model , in which the dissipation reflects the dynamics of a vortex liquid.@xcite despite these potential consequences , however , there have been few attempts to predict the vortex configuration in a bilayer . for weak",
    ", layer - antisymmetric disorder the appropriate model is a gauge glass,@xcite suggesting vortex liquids , glasses , or conventional superfluid states are possibilities.@xcite this is supported by exact diagonalization@xcite of small systems with white noise disorder .",
    "the aim of this paper is to predict the vortex configuration of a quantum hall bilayer , for the case of strong , long - range disorder , as is experimentally relevant for high mobility modulation doped samples .",
    "we argue that for a fixed disorder potential there is a characteristic value of the magnetic length , above which vortices proliferate .",
    "we find that this proliferation corresponds to the formation of an emulsion of vortex - antivortex crystals .",
    "our theory should be testable , since we estimate that the proliferation occurs in an experimentally accessible regime .",
    "furthermore , we argue that the proliferation causes a dramatic suppression of the decay of counterflow currents .",
    "we find a new length scale for this decay which is one to two orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding length scale in the clean system .",
    "this provides a possible explanation of a long - standing puzzle of the persistence of counterflow currents@xcite across an entire sample , in a regime where enhanced interlayer tunneling conductance is observed .",
    "such behavior is quantitatively confirmed in recent experiments which show an area scaling for tunneling currents@xcite up to the scale of @xmath1 .",
    "more generally , our work suggests that the quantum hall bilayer could be used to study a disordered form of the `` supersolid''@xcite that has previously attracted attention in superfluids , superconductors , and a clean bilayer model.@xcite    the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we develop a model for the vortex configuration of the bilayer , and identify the parameters which control the vortex density . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ground - states ] we present numerical results for the ground state of the model , and compare these with a mean - field theory of an emulsion . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we analyze the decay of counterflow currents in the ground state , suggest some further consequences of the emulsion , and discuss the role of antisymmetric disorder .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we begin by developing a model for the vortex configuration , which we solve both numerically and in a mean - field approximation .",
    "our starting point is the `` coherence network '' picture,@xcite in which the bilayer consists of compressible puddles of electron liquid , separated by channels of the incompressible counterflow superfluid ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "this is appropriate for the strong , smooth disorder produced by dopants , which destroys the superfluid over a significant fraction of the sample.@xcite we initially consider only layer - symmetric disorder , since the distance to the dopants is much larger than the interlayer separation .",
    "we focus on the simplest case of a balanced bilayer , where the filling fraction in each layer is @xmath0 , and initially also neglect the small interlayer tunneling .",
    "this picture leads us to postulate the hamiltonian @xmath2 the first term is the electrostatic energy of an inhomogeneous charge distribution , written in terms of the charge @xmath3 on the @xmath4 compressible puddle , and the inverse capacitance matrix of the puddles @xmath5 .",
    "the potential due to the dopants is contained in the continuous - valued shifts @xmath6 which would be the optimum charges on the puddles in classical electrostatics .",
    "this coulomb term was not considered by previous work on the coherence network .",
    "we will see that it is the competition between coulomb energy and superfluid stiffness that controls the proliferation of vortices in the system .    the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : basich ] models the energy of the channels .",
    "the condensate is characterized by a local phase @xmath7 , describing the interlayer phase coherence . since this phase can wind by integer multiples of @xmath8 around each puddle we associate vorticities @xmath9 with the puddles .",
    "the superfluid energy in the channels is @xmath10 , with stiffness@xcite @xmath11 . as usual",
    ", @xmath12 leads to a vortex - vortex interaction @xmath13 , and a constraint @xmath14 .",
    "the topological defects of the condensate are merons,@xcite which are vortices whose core corresponds to an unpaired electron in one layer .",
    "the meron charge is @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the vorticity , and @xmath17 denotes the layer index of the core . because of this relationship the two terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : basich ] are coupled , and the charge disorder can drive vorticity in the channels . for those puddles with @xmath18|>1/4 $ ]",
    "the electrostatics favors a half - electron charge , which is allowed if the vorticity around the puddle @xmath16 is odd .",
    "this costs a superfluid energy proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , a puddle will have @xmath19 if this incurs a superfluid energy cost smaller than the electrostatic energy gain .     surrounded by channels of incompressible excitonic superfluid of size @xmath20 . for smooth disorder @xmath21 and",
    "the depicted length scales are larger than the magnetic length @xmath22 . in the limit of very strong disorder",
    ", @xmath20 can become small and comparable to @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig : schematic],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    these considerations allow us to identify the parameter controlling the vortex density in the percolating channels .",
    "for a wide range of parameters both the channel width @xmath20 and puddle size @xmath23 will be on the order of the distance to the dopant layers , @xmath24.@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] for illustration of these length scales . )",
    "the largest contribution to the electrostatic energy is the coulomb interactions within each puddle .",
    "thus we estimate the electrostatic energy gain of a vortex as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the self - capacitance of the puddle .",
    "we estimate the superfluid energy cost as the prefactor of the vortex energy , which is generally @xmath27 .",
    "thus the vortex density is controlled by the ratio @xmath28 since @xmath29 is fixed by the sample , we expect the vortex density to vary with the magnetic length .    in the limit of very strong disorder@xcite",
    "@xmath20 becomes of the order the magnetic length @xmath30 , while @xmath23 remains of order @xmath31 .",
    "the vortex energy in this regime is @xmath32 , with the factor @xmath33 accounting for the fraction of the area occupied by the superfluid ( up to numerical factors depending on the shapes of the puddles ) .",
    "thus in the strong disorder limit the vortex density becomes independent of @xmath22 , @xmath34 .",
    "we estimate this numerical parameter by modeling the puddles as disks of radius @xmath35 , and taking @xmath36 from the mean - field theory@xcite at zero interlayer separation .",
    "this gives @xmath37 .    since our estimates of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the strong disorder limit are comparable , it may be possible to vary the density of vortices in experiments .",
    "decreasing @xmath22 should take the system further from the ( not unrealistic@xcite ) strong disorder limit , and so could lead to a reduction in the vortex density .",
    "more generally , reducing the vortex density requires a decrease in the capacitative energies , perhaps by placing gates on both sides of the sample as close as possible to the wells , or increasing the superfluid energy , perhaps in samples with smaller interlayer separation and larger tunneling .",
    "to predict the vortex density and configuration of the bilayer , we now derive and solve a hamiltonian for the vorticity . for simplicity",
    "we consider @xmath40 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms will not qualitatively affect the results , because the off - site coulomb interactions have a much shorter range than the vortex interactions @xmath41 .",
    "the diagonal elements are approximately constant , because they are controlled mainly by the characteristic puddle size .",
    "the main source of randomness is in the offset charges @xmath6 .",
    "taking @xmath42 as our unit of charge , we write the total charge on each puddle as @xmath43 , where @xmath17 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the meron - free charge . in the ground state @xmath46",
    "is the nearest even integer to @xmath6 .",
    "thus the electrostatic energy of a vortex @xmath9 on site @xmath47 is @xmath48.\\ ] ] this is the only energy contribution which depends on the layer index of the core @xmath49 , and @xmath50 can be minimized by setting @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath52 is broad on the scale of the charge quantization , because the puddles contain many electrons , so that @xmath53 is a uniformly distributed random variable between @xmath54 .",
    "thus , we see that the electrostatic energy takes the form @xmath55 , where @xmath56 varies randomly from site to site , with distribution @xmath57 . in the approximation",
    "that @xmath58 is the same for all puddles , @xmath56 is uniformly distributed between @xmath59 .",
    "note that in reality there will be some variation in @xmath58 from puddle to puddle , and the sharp edges in @xmath57 at @xmath59 will be smoothed out .    combining the electrostatic and superfluid energies",
    ", we thus have an effective hamiltonian for the vorticity @xmath60 we note that the random field is coupled to the presence of vortices , independently of their sign .",
    "this differs from gauge glass models , where the random field couples directly to the vorticity .     as a function of disorder energy scale @xmath38 , obtained by simulated annealing on systems of linear size @xmath61 , with @xmath62 monte - carlo sweeps per temperature step ( see text ) .",

    "[ fig : gsv ] ]",
    "numerical results for the ground states of eq .  [ eq : disordermodel ] are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : gsv ] and  [ fig : gstates ] .",
    "we adopt a lattice model ( as in ref .  ) where the channels are the edges of a square lattice of side @xmath61 .",
    "we take the prefactor of the vortex energy @xmath39 to be our unit of energy .",
    "thus @xmath66 is the lattice solution to @xmath67 , with the singularity removed.@xcite ground states were obtained by simulated annealing , with standard nearest - neighbor monte carlo moves .",
    "each ground state is obtained by recording the lowest energy state obtained during an anneal , from a temperature of @xmath68 to a temperature of @xmath69 , in steps of @xmath69 . at each temperature",
    "we perform @xmath62 sweeps of @xmath70 moves . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsv ] , increasing @xmath62 by a factor of @xmath71 does not significantly change the results , so we are obtaining good approximations to the ground states . the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsv ] are quenched averages of monte carlo data obtained for different disorder realizations .    from the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : gsv ] we see that the ground state is a uniform superfluid for small @xmath38 , while vortices proliferate above a threshold @xmath72 .",
    "the threshold behavior in @xmath73 as a function of @xmath38 is sharp due to the discontinuity in the on - site energy distribution @xmath57 , and would in reality be rounded due to the variations of @xmath38 between puddles .",
    "[ fig : gstates ] shows ground states obtained for a typical disorder realization at two different strengths .",
    "these results show that the vortex ground states are not completely disordered , and are strongly suggestive of an emulsion of vortex - antivortex crystals .",
    "this structure appears because the field in eq .",
    "[ eq : disordermodel ] does not dictate the sign of the vorticity . on the square lattice",
    "there is a minimum in the interaction @xmath74 at wavevector @xmath75 , so for a uniform field @xmath76 the ground state is a vortex - antivortex crystal.@xcite whereas a random field coupling to @xmath9 ( as in a gauge glass model@xcite ) competes with this ordering , the random field coupling to @xmath77 does not .",
    "it can therefore straightforwardly induce regions of the crystalline phase .",

    "[ eq : mfe - hom ] as a mean - field approximation for the microscopic effective hamiltonian @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes a site in the vortex - free phase , and @xmath89 one in the vortex crystal phase .",

    "demanding that the resulting energy agree with eq .",
    "[ eq : mfe - hom ] allows us to relate @xmath91 and the average @xmath92 to @xmath84 and @xmath86 .",
    "we then incorporate the random field term from eq .",
    "[ eq : disordermodel ] , @xmath93 , to obtain @xmath94 the mean - field equation is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes an average in the ground state of eq .",

    ", we find that , when @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 otherwise .",
    "we can also compute the energy , @xmath100 the solid lines in fig .",

    "we see that , in the limit of a vanishing correlation length for @xmath109 , the tunneling field has no effect because it averages to zero . in our case",
    ", the vortex phase field has a correlation length @xmath112 , corresponding to the weak - disorder regime of the random field model . in this regime ,",
    "the ground state @xmath113 consists of domains of linear size @xmath114 , aligned with the average random field across the domain .",
    "the typical tunneling energy in the random field is given by the sum of random energies in the range @xmath115 for @xmath116 correlation areas .",
    "this gives a typical energy of @xmath117 .",
    "the cost in phase stiffness in the domain is of the order of @xmath118 in two dimensions .",
    "balancing these two energies , we find the domain size @xmath119 we estimate that the josephson length @xmath120 while the correlation length @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , this domain size @xmath122 is a _ new _ length scale associated with the emulsion which could be one to two orders of magnitudes larger than @xmath123 in the clean system .",
    "moreover , we see that static perturbations to this disordered ground state ( @xmath124 ) , such as an injected counterflow current , decay over this new length scale @xmath122 .",
    "allowing for the considerable uncertainty in @xmath125 , this decay length ( @xmath126 mm ) predicted by our model is consistent with the apparent experimental bound@xcite ( @xmath127 mm ) .",
    "this should be contrasted with the vortex - free state which , as mentioned above , gives @xmath128 as the decay length .",
    "the vortices in the emulsion will not be completely pinned , and hence their presence will affect the counterflow superfluidity . even if the vortices remain pinned to the puddles they can move a distance @xmath23 across them , leading to a reduction in the stiffness.@xcite thermally activated hopping of vortices between the puddles may lead to dissipation , as in previous work on the coherence network,@xcite so that the emulsion may formally be a vortex liquid at finite temperatures .",
    "however , the distribution of @xmath56 in our model suggests a distribution of activation energies , in contrast to previous work .",
    "direct tests of our theory may be possible in imaging experiments.@xcite for example , our model predicts that charging lines corresponding to half - electron charges are common only when @xmath129 .",
    "more generally , the identity of physical and topological charge implies that the vortex configuration affects the charging spectra .",
    "finally , let us revisit the role of layer - antisymmetric disorder .",
    "it will give additional terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : esenergy ] which are proportional to @xmath49 , leading to terms linear in @xmath9 in the coulomb gas [ eq .  [ eq : disordermodel ] ] . provided the compressible puddles are effective at screening the antisymmetric disorder , the energy of the charge imbalance @xmath49 will be approximately @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the mutual capacitance of two puddles in opposite layers .",
    "this energy is a factor of @xmath132 smaller than @xmath58 , and the terms in @xmath9 are small compared with those in @xmath77 .",
    "thus while layer - antisymmetric disorder could affect correlations on very long scales , it will not affect the physical consequences described above , which are controlled by the scale @xmath23 .",
    "in conclusion , we have developed a model of a disordered quantum hall bilayer , in the experimentally relevant limit of strong , smooth disorder . we have argued that the ground state of this model can be understood as an emulsion of vortex - antivortex crystals .",
    "our theory suggests that the density of the emulsion could vary significantly with magnetic length , and between samples , allowing its effects to be isolated experimentally .",
    "an important physical consequence of the presence of such an emulsion ( or other disordered vortex state ) is a suppression of the decay of counterflow currents , potentially explaining the area scaling of the tunneling anomaly.@xcite"
