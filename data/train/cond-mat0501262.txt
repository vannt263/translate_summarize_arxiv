    "among transition - metal oxides cobalt compounds are of particular interest due to the possibility of the co ions to occur in different spin states .",
    "this is a long standing issue for the almost cubic perovskite lacoo@xmath4  where the co@xmath13 spin state changes as a function of temperature from a non - magnetic low - spin ( ls , s=0 ) state to an intermediate - spin ( is , s=1 ) or a high - spin ( hs , s=2 ) state , which both are magnetic.@xcite during the last years cobaltates with layered coo structures have also become subject of intense studies.@xcite it has been proposed that various of these compounds would also show temperature - dependent spin - state transitions of the co@xmath13 and/or co@xmath14 ions , but an unambiguous proof of such spin - state transitions is still missing ( see e.g.ref . ) . recently , the observation of superconductivity in na@xmath3coo@xmath15h@xmath16o has attracted much attention.@xcite the water - free parent compound na@xmath3coo@xmath16  became prominent some years ago already in a different context.@xcite it was found that na@xmath3coo@xmath16  with @xmath17 has a metallic electrical conductivity @xmath18 , but a low thermal conductivity @xmath0 and , in addition , a large thermopower @xmath1 .",
    "the combination of large @xmath18 , small @xmath0 , and large @xmath1 values is a precondition for effective thermoelectric cooling .",
    "the performance of thermoelectric devices depends on the so - called thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath11 where @xmath19 denotes the electrical resistivity . for an effective cooling , @xmath20 values ( @xmath21 is the absolute temperature ) of order unity should be reached and are found for instance in bi - based alloys , some thin - film devices or quantum dot superlattices.@xcite for comparison , typical metals have much smaller @xmath20 values of order @xmath22 . in this respect",
    "it was quite surprising that na@xmath3coo@xmath16  has @xmath23 for @xmath24k .",
    "the enhanced figure of merit of na@xmath3coo@xmath16  mainly arises from an enhanced thermopower.@xcite based on a study of the magnetic - field dependence @xmath25 of na@xmath3coo@xmath16  it has been argued that the spin entropy is the likely source for the large thermopower.@xcite    a large thermopower occurs also in la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4.@xcite this motivated us to study the transport properties of this series in order to determine experimentally the @xmath20 values and their dependence on temperature and doping .",
    "another motivation for our study was that the previous results do not give a consistent picture of the transport properties .",
    "for example , from various anomalous features in the temperature dependencies of @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and the magnetic susceptibility  @xmath26 a complex phase diagram was proposed for the la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  system.@xcite it has , however , been argued that the occurrence of some of these anomalous features depends on the preparation technique of the polycrystals.@xcite in fact , the phase diagram derived from @xmath27 and @xmath28 measured on la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  single crystals@xcite is much less complex than the previous one@xcite .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependencies of @xmath1 for undoped lacoo@xmath4  reported in refs . and   are contradictory . for @xmath29k",
    "both reports find a positive thermopower of order @xmath30v / k , which slightly increases with decreasing temperature . for @xmath31k , however , a further increase of @xmath1 with a maximum of about @xmath32v / k around 100k is found in ref . , whereas a sign change of @xmath1 and a decrease to about @xmath33v / k for @xmath34k is reported in ref .. the thermal conductivity of the la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  system has to our knowledge not yet been studied at all .",
    "in this report we present an experimental study of the thermal conductivity and the thermopower of a series of single crystals of la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  with @xmath35 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly describe the experimental setup and introduce the crystals , which ( partly ) have already been used in previous studies.@xcite in section[resdis ] our measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are discussed and we derive the thermoelectric figure of merit for the la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  series .",
    "the main results are summarized in the last section .",
    "the single crystals used in this study have been grown by a floating - zone technique in an image furnace .",
    "details of the sample preparation and their characterization by x - ray diffraction , magnetization , and resistivity measurements are given in ref .. at low temperatures lacoo@xmath4  is a good insulator , but with increasing sr content the resistivity systematically decreases and la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  becomes metallic for @xmath36 .",
    "samples with sr concentrations above the metal insulator transition show ferromagnetic order with transition temperatures @xmath37 around 220k , which slightly increase with @xmath7 .",
    "the magnetic order is accompanied by a kink - like decrease of @xmath27 below @xmath37.@xcite    the nominal valence of the co ions does not only depend on the sr content , but also on the oxygen concentration , i.e.  the amount @xmath38 of charge carriers in la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath39  is given by @xmath40 .",
    "positive ( negative ) values of @xmath38 mean hole ( electron ) doping and formally an amount @xmath38 of the co@xmath13 ions is transformed into co@xmath41 ( co@xmath14).@xcite because of the high oxidation state of co@xmath41 , one may suspect that with increasing sr concentration the amount of oxygen vacancies also increases , i.e.  an increasing @xmath7 could be partially compensated by a decreasing @xmath42 . in order to check this",
    "we have determined the oxygen content of the entire series la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath39  by thermogravimetric analysis ( tga / sdta851 , mettler - toledo ) .",
    "pieces of about 50 mg of the single crystals have been ground and heated up to 900@xmath43c in a reducing atmosphere ( n@xmath16 with 5% h@xmath16 ) in order to decompose la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath39  into la@xmath16o@xmath4 , sro and elementary co.@xcite the value of @xmath42 is then calculated from the measured weight loss .",
    "we have tested the reproducibility of our method by repeatedly measuring amounts of about 50 mg from the same badge of a lacoo@xmath4polycrystal .",
    "the different results agree to each other within @xmath44 , which is comparable to the uncertainty of the same and alternative methods of oxygen - content determination in cobaltates.@xcite a scatter of @xmath45 is also present in the determined oxygen contents of our la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath39  crystals",
    ". a linear fit of @xmath46 yields a weak decrease @xmath47 .",
    "therefore we determine the charge carrier content via @xmath48 , i.e.  our analysis reveals a 10% reduction of the charge - carrier content with respect to the sr content .",
    "we do not calculate @xmath40 for each crystal individually , because the scatter of @xmath49 would correspond to a scatter of the charge carrier content of @xmath50 , which can be excluded for the studied crystals from the measurements of the magnetization and resistivity ( see ref . ) .",
    "both quantities vary monotonously as a function of @xmath7 for @xmath51 .",
    "thus the scatter of @xmath38 between samples with neighboring @xmath7 is much smaller than their difference @xmath52 , which amounts e.g.  to only 0.01 for the lowest concentrations .",
    "this conclusion is also confirmed by the data presented in this report .",
    "the only exception is the thermopower of nominally undoped lacoo@xmath4 , which will be discussed below .",
    "the measurements of thermal conductivity and thermopower have been performed by a steady - state technique .",
    "one end of the rectangular bar - shaped crystals of typical dimensions @xmath53mm@xmath54 has been glued on a temperature - stabilized cu plate using an insulating varnish ( vge-7031 , lakeshore ) .",
    "a small resistor has been attached to the other end of the sample in order to produce a heat current through the sample .",
    "the corresponding temperature gradient over the sample was measured by a differential chromel - au+0.07%fe or a chromel - constantan thermocouple which has also been glued to the sample .",
    "typical temperature gradients were of the order of 0.2k .",
    "in addition , two gold contacts have been evaporated on the sample surface and two copper leads have been connected to these contacts by conductive silver epoxy in order to determine the thermopower .",
    "all offset voltages and the thermopower of the copper leads have been carefully subtracted . with our setup",
    "we do not obtain reliable results for @xmath1 on insulating samples with resistivities of the order of 10@xmath55 cm or larger , as it is the case for la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  with @xmath56 below about 100k .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the thermal conductivity and thermopower measurements is restricted to about 10% by uncertainties in the sample geometry , whereas the relative accuracy is of the order of a few percent .",
    "in fig.[wlf ] we show the thermal conductivity of la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4 .",
    "we concentrate first on the undoped compound . in an insulator like lacoo@xmath4",
    "the heat is usually carried by acoustic phonons .",
    "optical phonons play a minor role since their dispersion is typically much weaker than that of the acoustic branches .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the phononic heat transport is obtained from the relation @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 denote the specific heat , the sound velocity and the mean free path of the phonons , respectively . at low temperatures @xmath60",
    "is determined by lattice imperfections , or by the sample dimensions in very clean crystals , and the temperature dependence of @xmath0 follows that of the specific heat , i.e. @xmath61 for @xmath62k . at intermediate temperatures",
    "a maximum of @xmath0  occurs , when phonon - phonon umklapp scattering becomes important and leads to a decrease of @xmath60 with increasing temperature . at high temperatures",
    "@xmath60 is proportional to the number of phonons , i.e. @xmath63 and @xmath0 follows roughly a @xmath64 dependence if the temperature dependence of @xmath58 is not too strong , which is the case when the debye temperature is approached .    at first glance the results on lacoo@xmath4",
    "seem to be consistent with usual phononic heat transport .",
    "however , a closer inspection of the data reveals several anomalous features .",
    "the thermal conductivity above about 100k is anomalously small and its temperature dependence is very unusual , since above 150k the thermal conductivity slightly increases with increasing temperature .",
    "the small absolute values can not be attributed to strong defect scattering , since conventional defect scattering does not vanish below 100k so that @xmath0  would not increase and show a maximum below 100k .",
    "therefore , the small @xmath0  and its unusual temperature dependence indicate that an unusual , additional scattering mechanism is active above about 25k .",
    "it is , in principle , possible that low - lying optical phonons cause resonant scattering of acoustic phonons and therefore suppress the heat current in a certain temperature range.@xcite this could be an intrinsic feature of the phonons of the cubic perovskite structure or soft phonon modes could arise from a structural instability .",
    "however , there is , to our knowledge , no evidence for one of these scenarios .",
    "thus we regard an anomalous damping by optical phonons as rather unlikely .",
    "sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  as a function of temperature for different doping @xmath7.,width=302 ]    in lacoo@xmath4  there is another source for an unusual heat conductivity , which is related to the temperature - induced spin - state transition . with increasing temperature a thermal population of the is ( or hs ) state takes place . as has been shown in refs",
    "this causes a strongly anomalous thermal expansion above about 25k .",
    "a microscopic picture of the anomalous thermal expansion is obtained from the fact that in the ls state all six 3d  electrons are in the @xmath65orbitals , whereas in the is or hs states also @xmath66  orbitals are occupied .",
    "since the @xmath66  orbitals point towards the o@xmath67 ions their population will expand the corresponding coo@xmath68 octahedra . above 25k",
    "lacoo@xmath4  will therefore contain smaller and larger coo@xmath68 octahedra with co@xmath13 ions in the ls and is ( hs ) state , respectively .",
    "this implies an increasing lattice disorder above 25k , and therefore an additional suppression of the thermal conductivity .",
    "the disorder and thus the suppression of @xmath0  is most pronounced for an equal number of ls and is ( hs ) ions . for the proposed ls to is state scenario of lacoo@xmath4  with an energy gap @xmath69k between the ls and is states an equal occupation of ls and is ions is expected around @xmath70k",
    ". therefore the strong reduction of @xmath0  above 25k , its small absolute values and the weak minimum around 150k can arise from temperature - induced ls - is disorder .",
    "this picture , which has also been proposed in ref . , yields a consistent interpretation of the thermal conductivity data of lacoo@xmath4 .",
    "we note that the spin - state transition appears very favorable for the search of large @xmath20 values , because it may intrinsically suppress @xmath0 .",
    "a more quantitative study of the influence of the spin - state transition on @xmath0  is currently underway .",
    "the thermal conductivity of the crystal with @xmath71 is similar to that of pure lacoo@xmath4 , but the low - temperature maximum of @xmath0 is already strongly suppressed . for higher sr doping this",
    "maximum is almost completely absent and @xmath0 increases continuously with increasing temperature .",
    "the room temperature values of @xmath0 lie between 2 and 3w / km for all crystals with @xmath72 .",
    "we attribute the drastic suppression of @xmath0 at low temperatures to a sr - induced disorder , which hinders a strong increase of @xmath60 for @xmath62k .",
    "probably this disorder does not solely arise from the bare difference between la@xmath13 and sr@xmath14 ions . from magnetization measurements",
    "it is found that for @xmath73 so - called magnetic polarons with high spin values ( @xmath74 ) are formed.@xcite the idea is , that the divalent sr@xmath14 ions nominally cause the same amount of co@xmath41 ions , and that these magnetic ions induce a spin - state transition of the neighboring co@xmath13 ions from ls to is or hs states . due to such a polaron formation the disorder",
    "is strongly enhanced for the lowest sr concentrations , whereas for larger @xmath7 the polarons start to overlap and the enhancement becomes less effective .",
    "samples with @xmath36 show metallic conductivity and ferromagnetic order at low temperatures . in this concentration range one",
    "expects that magnetic polarons become much less important .",
    "however , the low - temperature peak of @xmath0  remains absent , since the sr concentration is so large , that the bare doping - induced lattice disorder is sufficient to suppress the low - temperature peak .",
    "moreover , the sr doping induces mobile charge carriers , which serve as additional scatterers for the phonons .",
    "the mobile charge carriers for larger @xmath7 are expected to transport heat , too .",
    "the total thermal conductivity therefore consists of a phononic contribution and a contribution of mobile charge carriers , i.e.  @xmath75 .",
    "usually , @xmath76 can be estimated by the wiedemann - franz law , which relates @xmath76 to the electrical conductivity according to @xmath77 . here",
    ", @xmath78v@xmath79/k@xmath79 denotes the sommerfeld value of the lorenz number . from the room temperature values of @xmath10 we estimate @xmath80k@xmath81 , 0.9 , 1.6 and 2.7w / km for @xmath82 , 0.18 , 0.25 and 0.3 , respectively , and @xmath83 for smaller @xmath7 .",
    "additional heat conduction by charge carriers is therefore relevant for metallic la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  only and explains why the crystals with @xmath84 have significantly larger @xmath85 values for @xmath86k than the insulating samples with @xmath6 .    of la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  with @xmath87 as a function of temperature measured in 15 t ( @xmath88 ) and in zero magnetic field ( @xmath89 ) .",

    "there is even a sign change and @xmath1 becomes negative for @xmath114k .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath1 to the magnetic ordering indicates that a considerable contribution of @xmath1 arises from magnetic entropy .",

    "<S> we present a study of the thermal conductivity @xmath0 and the thermopower @xmath1 of single crystals of la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  with @xmath5 . for all sr concentrations </S>",
    "<S> la@xmath2sr@xmath3coo@xmath4  has rather low @xmath0 values . for the insulators ( @xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> this arises from a suppression of the phonon thermal conductivity by lattice disorder due to temperature- and/or doping - induced spin - state transitions of the co ions . for larger @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the heat transport by phonons remains low , but an additional contribution from mobile charge carriers causes a moderate increase of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the thermopower of the low - doped crystals is positive and shows a pronounced maximum as a function of temperature . with increasing @xmath7 , this maximum strongly broadens and its magnitude decreases . </S>",
    "<S> for the highest sr content ( @xmath9 ) @xmath1 becomes even negative in the intermediate temperature range . from @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and the electrical resistivity @xmath10 we derive the thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath11 . for intermediate sr concentrations </S>",
    "<S> we find notably large values of @xmath12 indicating that co - based materials could be promising candidates for thermoelectric cooling . </S>"
