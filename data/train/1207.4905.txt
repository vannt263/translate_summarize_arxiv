    "quantum field theories with a topological term ( `` @xmath2-term '' ) in the action have proved to be particularly challenging to investigate .",
    "such theories are related to a few important open problems in theoretical physics , including the so - called `` strong @xmath4 problem '' in strong interactions , and to interesting phenomena in condensed matter physics , such as the quantum hall effect ( for a recent review on theories with @xmath2-term , see ref .",
    ".    on the one hand , topological properties are intrinsically nonperturbative , thus requiring a nonperturbative approach to the study of these systems . on the other hand , the most effective of these approaches , namely the numerical study by means of simulations in lattice field theory ,",
    "can not be directly applied to these systems , due to the presence of a so - called _",
    "sign problem_. in fact , the complex nature of their euclidean action prevents the computation of the relevant functional integrals by means of the usual importance - sampling techniques .",
    "numerical investigations have then required the use of techniques which allow to avoid the sign problem , usually based on analytic continuation or on the resummation of the contributions of the various topological sectors to the partition function  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of these techniques is to modify or split the functional integral , in such a way that the resulting expression(s ) have a positive - definite integration measure , and therefore can be treated with the usual numerical techniques .",
    "the difficulty of dealing with an oscillatory integrand is , however , not completely overcome , but simply shifted to the problem of reconstructing the original functional integral , which is usually a very delicate issue from the numerical point of view .",
    "it is worth noting that , beside having their own theoretical interest , theories with a @xmath2-term share the sign problem with finite - density qcd , and so the development of techniques and algorithms to solve or by - pass the sign problem can have positive consequences on the study of the qcd phase diagram by means of numerical simulations .    among the various existing models , the two - dimensional @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model with @xmath2-term ( @xmath5nl@xmath6 m ) deserves particular interest .",
    "it has been shown long ago by haldane  @xcite that chains of quantum spins with antiferromagnetic interactions , in the semiclassical limit of large but finite spin @xmath7 , are related to this model at coupling @xmath8 $ ] , and at @xmath9 or @xmath10 if the spin is respectively integer or half - integer .",
    "haldane conjectured that quantum spin chains for half - integer spins show a gapless spectrum , and correspondingly that a second - order phase transition takes place in the @xmath5nl@xmath6 m at @xmath0 , with vanishing of the mass gap and recovery of parity .",
    "arguments supporting this conjecture have been provided in ref .",
    "moreover , in ref .  @xcite it has been argued that the critical theory for generic half - integer spin antiferromagnets is the @xmath11 wess - zumino - novikov - witten ( wznw ) model  @xcite at topological coupling @xmath12 , which in turn should determine the behaviour of the mass gap near @xmath0 .",
    "numerical investigations of haldane s conjecture have been performed , following basically three different strategies .",
    "a first strategy  @xcite is based on the determination of the probability distribution of the topological charge by means of simulations at @xmath9 , which allows in principle to reconstruct the expectation values of the various observables at @xmath13 . in order to achieve the very high accuracy required by this approach , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have employed a constrained ( `` topological ''  @xcite ) action on a triangular lattice , which allows simulations by means of an efficient wolff cluster algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the action were chosen in order to be in the weak - coupling regime . using finite size scaling theory , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found a second order phase transition at @xmath0 , in agreement with haldane s conjecture , and a finite size scaling in good agreement with the assumption of a wznw - type of critical behaviour .",
    "a second strategy  @xcite is based on the determination of the mass gap at imaginary values of @xmath2 , that can be obtained directly by means of numerical simulations , and the subsequent analytic continuation to real values of @xmath2 , in order to check if the mass gap vanishes at some point .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found indeed that the mass gap vanishes at @xmath14 for some real @xmath15 , and moreover that @xmath16 within the errors , again in agreement with haldane s conjecture .",
    "finally , the third strategy  @xcite makes use again of numerical simulations at imaginary values of @xmath2 , in order to determine the topological charge density , and of a controlled way of performing the analytic continuation to real @xmath2 that greatly reduces the uncertainties connected to this process . applying this strategy to the @xmath17 model , that is expected to be equivalent to the @xmath1 model , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found a richer phase structure , with a first - order phase transition at @xmath0 for @xmath18 , and a line of second - order phase transitions with recovery of parity for @xmath19 , with continuously varying critical exponent . at @xmath20",
    "the critical exponent becomes @xmath21 , and parity is recovered analytically .    in this paper",
    "we want to investigate further on this issue , by applying the strategy of refs .",
    "@xcite directly to the @xmath5nl@xmath6 m .",
    "our aim is to understand the origin of the discrepancy between the results of refs .",
    "@xcite and those of ref .",
    "such a discrepancy could be of physical origin , due to the actual inequivalence of the @xmath1 and @xmath17 models , contrary to the standard wisdom ; or it could be of technical origin , due to shortcomings of the employed strategy in dealing with these models .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] we briefly review the method of refs .",
    "@xcite . in section [ sec : o3model ] we describe the model of interest , discussing in particular the theoretical prediction for the critical behaviour of the model at @xmath0 in the continuum , and working out the consequences for the observables relevant to our method . in section [ sec : num_sim ] we describe the @xmath5nl@xmath6 m on the lattice , and we discuss the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "finally , section [ sec : concl ] is devoted to our conclusions and to an outlook on open problems .",
    "details of the numerical analysis are reported in the appendix .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the relevant formalism and notation that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "the partition function of a theory with a topological term in the action is of the general form @xmath22 +   i\\theta q[\\phi ] } = e^{-vf(\\theta)}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the degrees of freedom of the model , @xmath24 is the appropriate functional measure , @xmath7 is the non - topological part of the action , and @xmath25 is the quantised topological charge , taking only integer values ; moreover , @xmath26 is the free energy density and @xmath27 the volume of the system .",
    "clearly , @xmath28 is a periodic function of @xmath2 , @xmath29 . in the interesting cases ,",
    "the integration measure is invariant under parity ( @xmath30 ) , and @xmath7 is @xmath30-even , while @xmath25 is @xmath31-odd . as a consequence , @xmath32 ; combining this with periodicity , we have that @xmath33 .",
    "while at @xmath34 parity is explicitly broken , at @xmath0 any @xmath30-odd observable has vanishing expectation value in a finite volume ; nevertheless , a phase transition may take place at this point .",
    "a convenient order parameter is given by the topological charge density , @xmath35 where we have introduced the notation @xmath36 { \\rangle}_{i\\theta } = z(\\theta)^{-1}\\int { { \\cal d}}\\phi\\ , e^{-      s[\\phi ] +   i\\theta q[\\phi ] } { \\cal o}[\\phi]\\,,\\ ] ] for the expectation value of the observable @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "in the limit of infinite volume , a nonzero value of @xmath38 indicates a first - order phase transition , while a divergent susceptibility @xmath39 indicates a second - order phase transition , and so on .    in order to reconstruct the behaviour of the order parameter near @xmath0 using numerical simulations",
    ", one has to start from imaginary values of the vacuum angle @xmath40 , with @xmath41 .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that a convenient observable is the quantity @xmath42 it is immediate to see that under analytic continuation @xmath43 one has @xmath44 i.e. , in terms of @xmath45 the analytic continuation is simply an extrapolation from @xmath46 to @xmath47 . notice that @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , with @xmath50 corresponding to @xmath0 . only if the topological charge density diverges at @xmath0 , which seems unlikely . ]",
    "the use of this observable is suggested by the antiferromagnetic one - dimensional ising model , where the role of the @xmath2-term is played by the coupling with an external imaginary magnetic field ( for an even number of sites ) .",
    "this model is exactly solvable , and one finds that @xmath51 actually depends only on a specific combination of @xmath45 and of the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath52 , namely @xmath53 .",
    "although this property is exclusive of the one - dimensional ising model , nevertheless one can expect that a similar smooth relation exists between @xmath54 and @xmath55 also in other models with @xmath2-term .",
    "the assumption usually made is that @xmath54 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath45 , vanishing only for @xmath50 ( i.e. , the order parameter does not vanish for @xmath56 ) ; this is indeed the case for the models where the exact solution is known .",
    "the quantity @xmath57 is then a monotonic function @xmath58 of @xmath51 , with the property that @xmath59 at @xmath60 , so that starting from the smallest values of @xmath51 that can be obtained by numerical simulations at real @xmath61 , one can therefore reliably extrapolate towards @xmath62 , i.e. , in the region corresponding to real @xmath40 .",
    "this is the advantage of this method , based on scaling transformations , over other approaches that involve an uncontrolled analytic continuation from imaginary values of @xmath2 .",
    "having reconstructed @xmath58 in this region , one can then easily reconstruct the order parameter at real @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , the closer one gets to @xmath60 , the better the extrapolation is expected to be : this method is then expected to work well in situations where the density of topological objects is small , such as asymptotically free models at weak coupling .",
    "if one is interested only in the critical behaviour at @xmath0 , it is possible to determine the critical exponent without explicitly reconstructing the order parameter . consider the effective exponent @xmath63 , @xmath64 assuming a critical behaviour @xmath65 near @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath66 near @xmath0 , one immediately sees that @xmath67 near @xmath50 , and so @xmath68 analogously , assuming that @xmath58 is analytic at @xmath60 , one can obtain @xmath69 from the relation @xmath70 .",
    "the method outlined above has been checked against explicitly solvable models , and successfully applied to models where the exact solution is not known ( see refs .",
    "one implicit assumption of this method is that the function @xmath58 has a `` reasonable '' behaviour near @xmath60 , i.e. , it can be well approximated by polynomials , or ratios of polynomials , or other `` simple '' functions .",
    "if this is the case , the critical exponent can then be obtained with fair accuracy . what has not been done",
    "yet is the evaluation of the impact of logarithmic corrections on the reliability of the extrapolation . the result eq",
    ".   holds independently of logarithmic corrections to the critical behaviour , i.e. , it holds even if @xmath71 ; nevertheless , the way in which the limit is approached in this case can make the extrapolation more difficult .",
    "this issue will be discussed further on in the next section .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the main properties of the @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model with a topological term ( @xmath5nl@xmath6 m ) in two dimensions , and we work out the consequences of the expected critical behaviour at @xmath0 for the method of scaling transformations described in the previous section .",

    "we are therefore interested in the critical behaviour of the model at @xmath151 and at finite @xmath164 , so that the observable of interest @xmath166 ( we are using now the subscript @xmath167 for lattice quantities ) is a well defined , finite quantity , which is a function of @xmath168 and @xmath164 , @xmath169 .",
    "separating now the renormalised continuum contribution from the rest , we have @xmath170 , where @xmath171 are finite corrections that vanish as @xmath172 .",
