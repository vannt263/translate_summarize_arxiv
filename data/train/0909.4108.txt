    "the local density was calculated for every sample galaxy using the fifth nearest neighbor method , obtaining that 80% of our galaxies were located in very low - density environments ( @xmath2 1 mpc@xmath3 ) , and 20% ( corresponding to more than 400 galaxies ) covers mostly the typical values measured for loose ( @xmath4 1 mpc@xmath3 ) and compact galaxy groups ( @xmath5 10 mpc@xmath3 ) .",

    "however , the errors in the clusters bar fractions are large and the results might be affected by the small number statistics . to deal with this problem , we are undergoing an ambitious project to study the bar fraction in a large sample of cluster galaxies drawn from the wings project ."
