    "it has been well established@xcite experimentally that the high-@xmath2 superconductivity in the cuprates shares the same off diagonal long range order ( odlro ) , in a form of electron cooper pairing , with a conventional @xmath3-wave bcs superconductor . in the bcs theory ,",
    "turning off such an odlro , say , by increasing temperature or applying a strong magnetic field , will lead to a landau s fermi liquid description of the normal state@xcite .",
    "the issue under debate is what is the ` normal state ' for a cuprate superconductor .",
    "experimentally it has been observed that the so - called _ pseudogap regime _ is always present at temperatures higher than the superconducting transition temperature @xmath2 , at least in the underdoped regime@xcite .",
    "the pseudogap phenomenon has been regarded as one of the most unique physical properties of cuprate superconductors . whether the pseudogap phase sets the stage for superconductivity to emerge as its low - temperature instability@xcite or it simply competes with superconductivity as an independent phase@xcite , has been a crucial issue .",
    "it has been a very challenging quest to understand the nature of pseudogap physics purely phenomenologically .",
    "alternatively , it is desirable to lay down a general theoretical framework or organizing principles first and then critically examine the experimental facts .",
    "once the self - consistency of a microscopic theory is established , its comparison with the rich experimental observations , even at a qualitative level , can either lend strong support for it or simply falsify it .",
    "it has been widely accepted that the cuprate superconductors are doped mott insulators of strong correlations@xcite . at half - filling ,",
    "the low - energy spin degrees of freedom are properly described by an antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model , while the charge degree of freedom is gapped due to the strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the low - lying charge degree of freedom is introduced by doping holes into the system@xcite .",
    "the superconducting state appears at low doping , where the af long - range order ( aflro ) gets destroyed by the motion of doped holes .",
    "experimentally , the mott gap seems to remain finite and large@xcite , which guarantees that the charge carriers are the doped holes , while the majority spins in the background are still neutral .",
    "namely , at least in the underdoped cuprates , the superconductivity occurs in a doped mott insulator regime@xcite .",
    "some main issues concerning the ground state physics are as follows .",
    "firstly , how the aflro at half - filling gets destroyed by doping ; secondly , how the superconductivity arises at finite doping ; thirdly , how the superconductivity begins to diminish at overdoping .",
    "once these are understood , then the next question is , after the superconducting coherence is destroyed by raising temperature or applying strong magnetic fields , what will be the normal state ?",
    "in particular , if the pseudogap phase is a natural normal state above the superconducting dome in a doped mott insulator ?    hence , the pseudogap physics can be used as a direct probe into a hypothesized superconducting ground state .",
    "the gutzwiller - projected bcs ground state or the so - called ` plain vanilla ' resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) state has been previously proposed@xcite to describe the superconductivity in the simplest doped mott insulator , i.e. , the two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the pseudogap properties based on this ground state ansatz has been intensively studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "recently , a new superconducting ground state ansatz has been proposed@xcite for the same @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "it is distinct from the aforementioned ` plain vanilla ' rvb ground state by a two - component rvb order instead of the one - component one .",
    "in contrast to the ` plain vanilla ' rvb state , the new ground state can recover an accurate description of the aflro state of the heisenberg model at half - filling ( zero doping ) limit , while predicts a different ( non - bcs ) superconductivity at finite doping@xcite .",
    "most importantly , the new ansatz state can explicitly keep track of a singular sign structure ( altered fermi statistical signs ) of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "specifically , the conventional fermion signs of non - interacting electron gas are completely removed by strong on - site repulsion in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at half - filling , which is described by the heisenberg model with the ground state precisely satisfying the so - called marshll sign rule@xcite that is non - statistical trivial sign structure .",
    "nontrivial sign structure ( known as the phase string effect@xcite ) only emerges upon doping , but is much sparser without bearing any similarity with the conventional fermion signs of the underlying electrons .",
    "based on such a new superconducting ground state@xcite , we shall present a theoretical description of the low - temperature pseudogap phase in this paper .",
    "some general properties unique to the present psuedogap phase are found as follows .",
    "the state is characterized by a generalized electron fractionalization . here",
    "the correlated electrons are described as if there are three subsystems : holons for doped holes of charge @xmath4 ; neutral spinons of @xmath5 ; and the backflow spinons accompanying the hopping process of the holons .",
    "what is particularly simplifying in such a low - temperature pseudogap phase is that the bosonic holons are always bose - condensed , while the neutral spinons and backflow spinons remain in two - component rvb pairing .",
    "in other words , the three subsystems are respectively all in the odlro states of their own respectively .",
    "it is well known that an odlro in a condensed matter system breaks a global symmetry , resulting in a generalized ` rigidity ' and great simplications for a many - body system .",
    "for these subsystems , the involved symmetries are actually the associated emerging u(1 ) gauge degrees of freedom upon fractionalization@xcite .",
    "the ` meissner ' effects due to these odlros then suppress the gauge fluctuations , which otherwise would strongly fluctuate and confine these fractionalized particles back to the electrons@xcite .",
    "thus , the hidden odlros of the subsystems protect the fractionalization of the electrons self - consistently .",
    "these hidden odlros do not necessarily break the _ true _ global symmetries of the system in general .",
    "as it turns out , the aforementioned nontrivial sign structure or phase string effect dictates the above peculier fractionalization of the electrons and mediate the so - called mutual chern - simons gauge interaction between the holons and neutral spinons .",
    "in contrast to the u(1 ) gauge fluctuations associated with the fractionalization , such topological gauge fields can not be ` higgsed ' by the hidden odrlos and play a crucial role in distroying the superconducting phase coherence in the pseudogap phase .",
    "the pseudogap behaviors are actually the explicit consequences of these hidden odlros . for example",
    ", the rvb ordering of the spinons is responsible for the pseudogap properties in the uniform magnetic susceptibility and specific heat capacity over a characteristic temperature @xmath6 set by a renormalized superexchange coupling ( which decreases with doping ) , known as the _ upper pseudogap phase _ ( upp)@xcite .",
    "it is in agreement with the early experiments@xcite .",
    "the holon condensation further defines a _ lower pseudogap phase _ ( lpp ) at lower temperatures .",
    "once it happens at a finite doping , the true aflro stops to develop because a doping - dependent , small gap is induced by the mutual chern - simons gauge fields in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "so the lpp is a ` spin liquid ' ( or short - ranged rvb state ) .",
    "it sets a stage for superconductivity to emerge , but the phase coherence is still disordered by thermally excited spin excitations , again via the mutual chern - simons gauge fields .",
    "such an lpp is thus featured by strong non - gaussian superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the longitudinal resistivity is of non - drude behavior , which is supplemented with a strong nernst effect .",
    "all of these are clear at variance with the usual gaussian fluctuations in a narrow critical regime of a bcs superconductor@xcite .",
    "these anomalous pseudogap properties in the lpp are qualitatively consistent with the experimental observations in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "finally , the true superconducting instability happens when temperature is sufficiently lower than the spin gap , where the fractionalized spin excitations becomes ` confined ' via the mutual chern - simons gauge fields , and their novel phase disordering effect on the superconducting coherence gets screened out below @xmath2@xcite .",
    "it is noted that the lpp as a spin liquid / vortex liquid state has been previously studied by effective theory approaches@xcite .",
    "the present study further provides a microscopic framework based on the wave function description , which handles the short - range correlations more carefully .",
    "the main distinction is an emergent two - component rvb structure in the spin background@xcite .",
    "namely , the spin degrees of freedom are now composed of two : a spin liquid always pinned at half - filling together with the so - called _ backflow _ spinons describing the hopping effect on the spin background .",
    "such a two - component rvb structure further predicts another non - superconducting state , which may be obtained with the turning off the odlro of the backflow spinons by strong magnetic fields , say , in the magnetic vortex core region .",
    "this core state is to be called the lpp - ii , in which the backflow spinons become charged with coherent fermi pockets , whose luttinger volume is commensurate with the doped holes .",
    "it is responsible for a novel quantum oscillation and the pauli behavior of the spin susceptibility , and provides a consistent explanation for the experiments@xcite .",

    "in other words , it is non - superconducting but is most closely related to the superconducting ground state . to characterize such an lpp microscopically , in the following , we start with a new superconducting ground state ansatz , which has been recently proposed@xcite for the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .      in a doped mott insulator ,",

    "in contrast to the former , the spinon - vortex - antivortex pairing will not annihilate each other at @xmath135 , because of the conserved spinon numbers .",
    "instead , they form tightly bound vortex - antivortex pairs as the corresponding spinons form rvb pairs in the ground state ( [ phirvb ] ) .",
    "when single spinon - vortices are created by breaking up such rvb pairs , the minimal excitation energy essentially measures the @xmath32-spinon excitation spectrum ( without creating vortices as they are already there in the ground state ) .",

    "the contribution of those rvb paired spinons to @xmath196 is thus cancelled out at a length scale larger than @xmath213 or in other words the ground state is a spin liquid state and at the same time a vortex - antivortex binding state .",
    "thermally excited spinons in the lpp - i are spontaneous vortices which form a vortex liquid@xcite . then , when temperature is substantially lower than @xmath340 , only a very small amount of free spinons get thermally excited .",
