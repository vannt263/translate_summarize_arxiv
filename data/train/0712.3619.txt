    "the formation and observation of a quark - gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions is an important goal of modern nuclear physics . even if a quasiequilibrated plasma is created for a brief time in the collisions , it is still a challenge to infer knowledge of the plasma from particle production . among those proposed  \" probes  \" of the plasma are the directly produced real photons .",
    "those photons interact only electromagnetically , and so their mean free paths are typically much larger than the transverse size of the hot dense matter created in the collisions . as a result , high - energy photons produced in the interior of the plasma usually pass through the surrounding matter without interaction , carrying information directly from wherever they were formed to the detector .",
    "one expects to deduce properties of the highly excited matter , in particular it s space - time evolution .",
    "direct photons may provide these informations in two different ways : via so - called  \" thermal photons  \"",
    "emitted directly from hot and dense matter , and via secondary photons from initially produced jets .",
    "there are two kinds of such secondary photons : they may originate from the  \" fragmentation  \" of jets , or the  \" conversion  \" of jets into photons via interactions of jets with the partons of the equilibrated matter .",
    "such secondary photons compete , however , with the photons directly produced in an initial hard nucleon - nucleon scattering , in the following referred to as  \" primordial nn scattering  \" contribution , so",
    "a carefully study of these photons is very important . in the following",
    ", we will shortly review these different photon sources .    *",
    "_ primordial nn scattering .",
    "_ * the direct photon production via compton scattering and quark - antiquark annihilation can be calculated in perturbation theory , using the usual parton distribution functions . in principle",
    "one should consider at this stage also higher order contributions , like bremsstrahlung of photons accompanying for example two - jet production in hards parton - parton scattering .",
    "however , we consider this as part of the so - called jet fragmentation ( or bremsstrahlung ) contribution , which will be affected by the thermalize matter , and which we will discuss separately .    *",
    "_ thermal photons . _ * in high energy nuclear collisions , the density of secondary partons is so high that the quarks and gluons rescatter and eventually thermalize to form a bubble of hot quark - gluon plasma ( qgp).the plasma expands and decreases its energy density so that a phase transition to hadronic gas ( hg ) phase appears .",
    "thermal photons can be produced during the whole history of the evolution , from the qgp phase , the mixed phase , and from the pure hg phase .",
    "photons from a thermal source are exponentially damped so that the contribution to very high @xmath0 is negligible .",
    "however , its contribution to low @xmath0 is dominant .    * _ jet - photon conversion . _ * when jets pass through thermalized matter , they may interact . in case of the quark - gluon plasma ,",
    "these interactions are elastic collisions between jets and deconfined partons .",
    "there is first of all quark - antiquark annihilation and quark - gluon compton scattering , which both can produce a photon .",
    "these photons are affected by the plasma in two ways : obviously the plasma is needed to allow these interactions , but there is also a secondary effect , since the jets first of all lose energy in the plasma , before contributing to the photon production .    *",
    "_ jet fragmentation or bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "_ * photon production also occurs as higher order effect in purely partonic initial hard scatterings : at any stage of the evolution of a jet ( final state parton emissions ) , there is a possibility of emitting photons . also here",
    "the presence of a qgp will affect the results , since the jets lose energy during the fragmentation process . and not to forget the fragmentation contribution from induced gluon radiation in the plasma .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 and 3 , we discuss thermal photon production ; in section 4 , we study hard photons from primordial nn scattering ( leading order ) ; in section 5 we study jet - photon conversion , including the modification due to jet energy loss ; in section 6 we compute photon production from jet fragmentation , also referred to as bremsstrahlung s photons , again considering the effect of energy loss ; in section 7 we finally collect our results and compare with experimental data .",
    "thermal photon production is obtained by integrating the photon emission rate @xmath1 ( number of reactions per unit time per unit volume which produce a photon ) over the space - time history of the expanding hot and dense matter . in this section",
    "we study the photon emission rates from different phases of the hot dense matter .",
    "the spectral photon emissivity directly reflects the dynamics of real photon production reactions in thermalized matter .",

    "we can see the full contribution to photon emission from a qgp is much higher than the one from @xmath29 partonic processes .",
    "photons can also be produced in a hadronic phase , from several elementary interactions , see fig.[fig : fdg_hg1 ] .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the reactions @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; the decay @xmath32 also contributes significantly .",
    "interactions involving strange mesons or baryons can also produce photons , but these contributions are relatively small because of the phase space suppression due to their big masses .",
