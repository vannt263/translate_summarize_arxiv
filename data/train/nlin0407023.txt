    "a dispersion management is key current technology for development of ultrafast high - bit - rate optical communication lines @xcite .",
    "a dispersion - managed ( dm ) optical fiber is designed to achieve low ( or even zero ) path - averaged group velocity dispersion by periodic alternation of the sign of the dispersion along an optical line which dramatically reduces pulse broadening .",
    "if nonlinearity is neglected it would be possible to achieve transmission of optical pulses through dm system without significant distortion .",
    "however , the linear transmission is limited by the nonlinear distance @xmath0 and the characteristic pulse power @xmath1 ; @xmath2 is the propagation distance along fiber .",
    "the characteristic power can not be chosen too small in order to maintain appropriate value of the signal - to - noise ratio . as a result ,",
    "kerr nonlinearity is essential for pulse propagation which results in distortion of optical pulses and finite bit error rate ( ber ) for information transmission .",
    "there are two alternative approaches to deal with optical nonlinearity .",
    "first approach is to reduce nonlinearity i.e. to make fiber system as close as possible to linear system .",
    "e.g. one can use low nonlinearity fiber  @xcite with increased cross section .",
    "another approach is to compensate nonlinearity ( nonlinearity management ) using either semiconductor devices  @xcite or interferometer - based compensation of nonlinear phase shift  @xcite .",
    "these systems usually refer to as quasi - linear systems and they attracted very much attention in recent years .",
    "disadvantage of quasi - linear systems is that nonlinearity is still essential at long enough distance@xcite ( e.g. transoceanic distance ) and it results in information losses .",
    "also quasi - linear systems often require complex and cumbersome dispersion compensation@xcite .",
    "second approach is not to reduce nonlinearity but rather to use nonlineariy to achieve high bit rate transmission .",
    "this approach is based on a concept of using of dm solitons as the carrier of a bit of information .",
    "dm soliton is a solitary pulse which propagates in optical fiber  @xcite .",
    "dm soliton experiences periodic oscillations , as a function of propagation distance , with period of dispersion compensation .",
    "single dm soliton can propagate in optical fiber without distortion ( except periodic oscillations ) for arbitrary long distance even for nonzero path - averaged dispersion ( dispersion , averaged over period of dispersion variation ) .",
    "propagation without distortion results from balance between nonlinearity and dispersion on the period of dispersion compensation .",
    "in contrast , quasi - linear pulse would increase its width with propagation distance ( in addition to periodic oscillations ) due to nonzero path - averaged dispersion .",
    "dm soliton - based transmission has its own disadvantages caused by interaction between different dm solitons ( representing different bits of information ) .",
    "there are two types of interactions .",
    "first type is caused by the interaction between dm solitons with the same carrier frequency ( the same information channel ) .",
    "in addition , modern optical lines use a wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) which allows the simultaneous transmission of several information channels , modulated at different wavelengths , through the same optical fiber .",
    "wdm means that there is also a second type of interaction , which is the interaction between dm solitons in different channels .",
    "traditionally , the second type is considered to be the most dangerous because dm solitons in different channels move with different group velocity and , respectively , they pass through each other causing collisions through nonlinear interaction .",
    "collisions result in a jitter in dm soliton arrival times and finite ber .",
    "however , recently , the record - breaking , 1.09tbits / s , transmission was achieved at 18,000 km optical line based on dm solitons  @xcite which brought increasing interest to dm soliton - based transmission systems .",
    "the interchannel interactions in that transmission experiment were suppressed by a periodic - group - delay dispersion - compensating module  @xcite , and intrachannel interaction is most important .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to determine the tails dm soliton which determines the interaction of dm solitons in the same channel .",
    "soliton tails are responsible for interaction of pulses launched into optical fiber which essentially limits bit - rate capacity of optical line and makes finding dm soliton asymptotic behaviour an important practical and fundamental problem .",
    "it is found that envelope of soliton decays exponentially in time ( much slower decay compare to gaussian ) so one can expect a strong interaction of different dm solitons .",
    "neglecting polarization effects , higher order dispersion , losses , stimulated raman scattering and brillouin scattering , the propagation of optical pulse in a dm fiber is described by a scalar nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the envelope of optical pulse , @xmath5 is the propagation distance , @xmath6 is the retarded time , @xmath7 is the group - velocity dispersion which is the periodical function of @xmath5 , @xmath8 is the nonlinear coefficient , @xmath9 is the nonlinear refractive index , @xmath10 is the carrier wavelength , @xmath11 is the effective fiber area that in general case depends on @xmath5 .",
    "typical values of dispersion and nonlinear coefficient are @xmath12 @xmath13 for standard monomode fiber , and typical values for dispersion compensating fiber are @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the typical period of dispersion variation , @xmath18 is the typical pulse duration and @xmath19 is the typical pulse power . for typical optical lines",
