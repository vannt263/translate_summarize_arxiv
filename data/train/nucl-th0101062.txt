    "the @xmath0 anomaly of qcd plays an essential role in hadron physics .",
    "one of its most striking manifestations would probably be the @xmath2 meson mass .",
    "since the @xmath0 symmetry is broken not spontaneously but explicitly by the anomaly , @xmath2 can not be regarded as a nearly massless nambu - goldstone boson like the other psuedoscalar mesons .",
    "in fact , the mass of @xmath2 is as large as the nucleon mass , i.e. @xmath3 .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0 problem .",
    "the topological susceptibility , @xmath1 , is an essential quantity in considering the @xmath0 problem because it is related to @xmath4 through the witten - veneziano mass formula @xcite , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of the flavors and @xmath7 is the pion decay constant .",
    "this formula has been confirmed by calculating @xmath1 directly on the lattice@xcite : the calculations give @xmath8 , which is consistent with the value obtained by plunging into the formula ( [ wv ] ) experimental values of the pion decay constant and the meson masses .",
    "thus , the topological susceptibility could tell us as much information about the @xmath0 anomaly as does @xmath4 .",
    "the tool we will employ in this work for the investigation of the @xmath0 problem is the three flavor nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite which can be used as an effective theory of qcd .",

    ". the determinants in eq .",
    "( [ thooft ] ) are with respect to the flavor indices .",
    "the free quark lagrangian @xmath13 contains the current quark mass term with @xmath14 , breaking the @xmath15 symmetry explicitly . throughout this article",
    ", we assume the exact isospin symmetry , i.e. @xmath16 . the term @xmath17 generates the four - point couplings and is invariant under the @xmath15 transformation .",
    "the six - point , determinant term @xmath18 is what is called the t  hooft interaction and breaks the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this interaction simulates the @xmath0 anomaly in our scheme , and the effective coupling constant @xmath19 measures its strength .",
    "let us review the status of parameter setting in the njl model .",
    "the parameters to be fixed are , the current quark masses ( @xmath20 ) , the three - momentum cut - off ( @xmath21 ) , and the effective coupling constants ( @xmath22 and @xmath19 ) . the physical quantities usually taken as inputs are , @xmath23 , @xmath7 , @xmath24 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the question we bring out here is as to @xmath4 which has been used for the determination of @xmath19 .",
    "as is well known , the njl model lacks in confinement , and in fact , in this model @xmath2 decays into asymptotic @xmath25 states due to its large mass .",
    "thus @xmath4 in the njl model is not a well - defined quantity .",
    "the alternative quantity for the determination of @xmath19 we will use here is the topological susceptibility , which contains the information about the @xmath0 anomaly and whose value has been given by lattice monte - carlo simulations , as mentioned above .",
    "one of the main purposes in the current work is to derive the expression for the topological susceptibility within the framework of the njl model , and to fix the parameter @xmath19 by means of @xmath1 as an input .",
    "recently , the behavior of the effect of the @xmath0 anomaly at finite temperature has been discussed intensively @xcite . in particular ,",
    "special attentions have been paid to whether or not the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry and the chiral phase transition occur simultaneously .",
    "this question is still controversial and is not settled yet . here",
    ", we should clarify what we mean by ` the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry . '",
    "it means that all @xmath0 violating quantities vanish , i.e.  that all order parameters of the @xmath0 symmetry vanish .",
    "symmetry restoration . ]",
    "the possibility that @xmath2 would degenerate with the other pseudoscalar mesons has a great deal of significance upon the experimental view in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . in the njl model , the definition we gave above is equivalent to @xmath19 getting to zero , since finite @xmath19 makes the @xmath0 symmetry breaking manifest in the njl lagrangian ( [ njl ] ) . since the origin from which a finite value of @xmath19 arises is the presence of instantons in the physical state , the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry",
    "is expected owing to the naive argument that the instanton density will be suppressed at sufficiently high temperature .",
    "thus when the magnitude of @xmath19 becomes smaller , we will call it ` the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry . '",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath19 in the njl model , which indicates nothing but the temperature dependence of the @xmath0 anomaly , has been put by hand and not gone beyond phenomenology @xcite .",
    "this is both because experimental data for @xmath4 at finite temperature , which are necessary for determination of @xmath19 , are not available , and because @xmath2 becomes unbound completely in the model soon after we raise the temperature from zero .",
    "since the topological susceptibility has been calculated at finite temperature on the lattice , we will be able to determine the temperature dependence of @xmath19 using that data , and obtain some knowledge about the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we will derive the expression for @xmath1 in the njl model .",
    "[ sec3 ] is devoted to parameter setting of the model and numerical calculations of the physical quantities .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "in this section , we calculate the topological susceptibility , @xmath1 , within the framework of the njl model .",
    "the first task is to know a general expression of @xmath1 .",
    "we recapitulate here the definition of @xmath1 .",
    "we begin with the qcd lagrangian density @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath28 is the covariant derivative with @xmath29 being the gluon field , @xmath30 is the qcd vacuum angle , and @xmath31 is the topological charge density defined by @xmath32 with this lagrangian density , the vacuum energy density @xmath33 is written as @xmath34 in a path integral form , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the space and time volumes , respectively . the topological susceptibility @xmath1 is defined as a second derivative of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath30 at @xmath37 , @xmath38 where t stands for the time ordering operator , and the subscript ` connected ' means to pick out the diagrammatically connected contributions .",
    "thus , in order to calculate @xmath1 in the njl model , it is necessary to find a correspondent to @xmath39 in the model . for that purpose , we consider the four - divergence of the @xmath0 current , @xmath40 . in qcd",
    ", one has @xmath41 which does not vanish due to the anomaly .    on the other hand , in the njl model ( eqs .",

    "we can write @xmath48 so that @xmath49 now we must evaluate these four matrix elements . for the time being , we pick up one term out of the four . following wick s theorem ,",
    "we take full contraction in terms of the propagator @xmath50 that has been constructed in the self - consistent gap equation @xcite .",
    "although several ways of contraction are possible , there exists only one that is the leading order in expansion in terms of inverse powers of the number of colors , i.e. @xmath51 . the situation is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by means of the finite range representation .",
    "the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] contain @xmath52 coming from traces over color .",
    "the diagram ( c ) contains @xmath53 and is the leading order in @xmath51 expansion .",
    "notice that ( b ) is the exchange term for ( c ) and is lowered by @xmath51 as compared with ( c ) . since the gap equation for the constituent quark masses and the dispersion equations for the meson masses",
    "are derived up to the leading order of the large @xmath54 expansion @xcite , we should take only the contribution of ( c ) for the consistent treatment .    taking account of the four terms in eq .",

    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "they are of the same order as fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) because , while each four - point vertex is of @xmath66@xcite , it is compensated by a factor @xmath54 coming from its neighboring loop . we have to include all these diagrams for consistency of the @xmath51 expansion .",
    "we will call their sum @xmath67 , for they are regarded as the ring diagrams to be resummed in the mean field approximation .",
    "of course , the sum of these ring diagrams with the one - loop diagram included can be interpreted as a propagation of a certain meson .",
    "note that the momentum of the propagating particle is zero ; @xmath68 .",

    "we note that the diagrams in fig .",

    "( [ chi2 ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) , we arrive at the expression for the topological susceptibility , @xmath91.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us give one more comment . in general ,",
    "a two - point correlation function of gauge invariant operators may be decomposed into the sum over multi - particle intermediate states by inserting a complete set between two operators .",
    "it is known that the dominant contributions of the leading order in @xmath51 expansion are those of one - particle intermediate states .",
    "moreover witten@xcite and veneziano@xcite have derived their formula by assuming that , when the momentum of the intermediate particle is zero , which is the case of @xmath1 , the contribution of the @xmath90 propagating state is the only leading term in @xmath51 expansion .",
    "these statements are quite consistent with our specific model calculation respecting large @xmath54 expansion ( although @xmath92 and mixing channels besides @xmath90 propagate in the intermediate states in our model due to the explicit @xmath86 symmetry breaking ) .",
    "now that we have obtained the expression for the topological susceptibility , we proceed to numerical calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sub31 ] , we set the parameters at zero temperature by employing @xmath1 . with the determined parameters , we calculate physical quantities . in sec .",
    "[ sub32 ] , we discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath1 and the six - point coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "the parameters to be set in the njl model are ; @xmath93    as for @xmath16 , we set them to be @xmath94 following ref .",
    "@xcite .    to set the other four parameters , we use the following quantities as inputs , @xmath95 the fourth quantity we use here in place of @xmath96 is , as mentioned in the introduction , the topological susceptibility @xmath1 . the numerical value of @xmath1 is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath1 is calculated in the quenched approximation .    initially , however , we will calculate with the parameters determined by using @xmath4 as input in order to check consistency of @xmath4 and @xmath1 in the njl model .",
    "parameter setting with @xmath4 has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the results are @xmath97 the physical quantities calculated from these parameters are summarized in the first column of table [ table ] .",
    "we first check the witten - veneziano mass formula ( [ wv ] ) within the njl model .",
    "the computed values of @xmath1 and @xmath98 with those parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite are @xmath99 so that the ratio of lhs to rhs in eq .",
    "( [ wv ] ) turns out to be @xmath100 on the other hand , the ratio of @xmath101 to @xmath102 , which means how much the conventional parameters determined with @xmath4 reproduces the lattice data of @xmath1 , is @xmath103 > from the above two ratios , we can say that as a whole , @xmath4 and @xmath1 are reproduced well simultaneously in the njl model .",
    "now we consider parameter setting with @xmath1 used .",
    "the topological susceptibility , @xmath1 might be a more suitable quantity for parameter setting than @xmath4 for the following two reasons :    * since @xmath2 decays into asymptotic @xmath25 state due to lack of confinement in the njl model , @xmath4 may be a less reliable quantity , while @xmath1 is free from such a shortcoming of the njl model . * the value of @xmath1 , @xmath104 is small enough compared with the cut - off @xmath105 .",
    "thus the njl model is expected to describe @xmath1 well .",
    "the parameters obtained by using @xmath106 are @xmath107 we note that @xmath108 becomes larger than the case of using @xmath4 as an input , which implies that the binding of @xmath2 is loosened .",
    "( the t  hooft interaction loosens the binding of mesons , that is , induces a repulsive force between quarks .",
    "this can be seen from the very fact that @xmath2 becomes massive due to the interaction . )",
    "physical quantities calculated with these parameters are shown in the second column of table [ table ] .",
    "the solution for @xmath4 in the mean field approach does not exist , that is , @xmath2 is not bound any more .",
    "we see that @xmath109 is improved slightly .",
    "although @xmath2 no longer exists in the njl model , we could infer its mass by utilizing the witten - veneziano mass formula ( [ wv ] ) ; @xmath110 is obtained .",
    "we close this subsection by referring to the study due to takizawa , nemoto , and oka @xcite , in which the parameters , especially the six - point coupling constant @xmath19 , are determined in a different approach .",
    "they examined the radiative decays of an @xmath111 meson such as @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , and obtained rather strong six - point coupling constant @xmath108 , namely , four times as large as that determined by using @xmath4 .",
    "although we can not compare our parameters directly with theirs due to different cut - off schemes ( their scheme is the four - momentum cut - off ) , it is not probable that our result is compatible with theirs .",
    "still , we believe that our approach is rather straightforward to probe the @xmath0 anomaly .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath19 , comparing the njl calculation of @xmath1 with the lattice data .",
    "the lattice data for the topological susceptibility @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] with error bars .",
    "the @xmath115 in the figure denotes the temperature of the chiral phase transition .",
    "although @xmath116 in the original ref .",
    "@xcite , we have rescaled it to @xmath117 .",
    "we should notice that the lattice data are computed only up to @xmath118 .",
    "unfortunately , the lattice data are absent at high temperatures . at any rate ,",
    "the data show that @xmath1 drops rapidly around @xmath115 .    one comment should be noted .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 drops near @xmath115 does not always mean the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry at @xmath115 .",
    "this can be seen by returning to the witten - veneziano mass formula ( [ wv ] ) , @xmath119 we realize that the pion decay constant @xmath7 , which is associated with the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath120 ) , has entered the formula . since @xmath7 would become zero along with the restoration of the chiral symmetry , @xmath1 is also expected to become zero around @xmath115 . in this sense ,",
    "the lattice data which show the dropping of @xmath1 at @xmath115 is what should be expected from the formula , and rather , we could consider that the data confirm the validity of the witten - veneziano mass formula .",
    "thus the dropping of @xmath1 in the lattice data should be attributed to the restoration of the chiral symmetry , and does not always indicate the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it is worth noting that this behavior results from large @xmath54 expansion . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that @xmath121-point correlation functions ( @xmath122 ) can not detect any effect of the @xmath0 anomaly in the chiral symmetric phase .",
    "one might have thought that the dropping of @xmath1 near @xmath115 would be regarded as @xmath1 s insensitivity to the @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "however , it is not the case because @xmath1 is not a @xmath0 singlet quantity .",
    "in fact , it contains contributions carrying the @xmath0 charge 2 , 0 and -2 .",
    "thus @xmath1 is an appropriate quantity to observe the fate of the @xmath0 symmetry even in the chiral symmetric phase , in principle , even though careful attention should be paid in order to infer correct meanings .    in this respect ,",
    "the discussions of schaffner - bielich@xcite is obscure ; he discusses under the assumption that @xmath1 and the @xmath0 anomaly are equivalent to each other and that the dropping of @xmath1 at @xmath115 immediately means the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "his assumption is considered as correct only if the dropping rate of @xmath1 is much faster than that of @xmath7 . to judge the validity for",
    "this prevailing assumption is what we pursue in the present work .",
    "in fact , as discussed below , our result reveals that the assumption has no convincing reliability , at least , within the framework of the njl model .",
    "now we consider the temperature dependence of @xmath1 in the njl model . among the four parameters ( @xmath123 ) , we might reasonably fix @xmath124 and @xmath21 at the values determined at zero temperature .",
    "in general , however , we should take account of temperature dependences of the coupling constants @xmath125 and @xmath108 . as for @xmath125",
    ", it would be hard or almost hopeless to get information about the temperature dependence even in some phenomenological sense . here",
    ", we make an assumption that @xmath125 does not depend on temperature .",
    "this might be partially justified by the fact that even if @xmath125 is constant , the njl model restores the chiral symmetry as a consequence of its own dynamics .",
    "we now pay attention to the behavior of @xmath108 , which indicates the temperature dependence of the @xmath0 anomaly . for the first case ,",
    "we treat @xmath108 as a constant parameter and fix it at the values at zero temperature",
    ". we will call this prescription case a. the calculated temperature dependence of @xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( the solid line ) .",
    "we see that @xmath1 in the njl model drops near @xmath115 as the dynamical consequence and reproduces the lattice data up to @xmath126 considerably well .",
    "this result means that the @xmath0 symmetry is not restored at least up to @xmath126 , and we conclude that the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry does not coincide with the chiral phase transition .    at high temperatures , of course",
    ", we can not judge whether or not the @xmath0 symmetry is restored , since we lack the lattice data in those temperatures .",
    "if we believe that the instanton density is suppressed exponentially at high temperatures as is expected by the pisarski - yaffe factor@xcite , and the correlation of the topological charges , i.e. , @xmath1 is also suppressed exponentially , the fitted line for the lattice data with a fermi function in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( the dashed line ) could be considered as reasonable behavior .",
    "we notice here the deviations of the njl calculation ( the solid line ) from the fitted line at high temperatures . as the case",

    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "we notice that there are two lumps around @xmath115",
    ". it would be senseless to take them seriously since we have ignored the temperature dependence of @xmath125 that should have been taken into account in principle .",
    "rather , we should note that the @xmath0 symmetry is restored at high temperatures as is expected from the starting assumption that the instanton density is suppressed at those temperatures ; the consistency is maintained in the njl model .",
    "we now calculate the constituent quark masses , the meson masses , and the pion decay constant in our case a and case b. the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5]@xmath42[fig12 ] .",
    "the qualitative features are almost the same as those of the case i by hatsuda and kunihiro@xcite .    finally , we give the temperature dependence of @xmath4 in figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] that could be obtained by utilizing the witten - veneziano mass formula ( [ wv ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 mass goes to infinity at around @xmath127 in either case a or b. this is because @xmath7 gets to zero at that temperature .",
    "we have removed those infinities above the temperature at which @xmath7 vanishes because it is considered that our approximation scheme is broken down there .",
    "we have derived the expression for the topological susceptibility , @xmath1 , in the njl model within the same approximation as for the constituent quark masses and the meson masses , namely in the leading order of large @xmath54 expansion . at zero temperature ,",
    "we have performed parameter setting by employing @xmath1 in place of @xmath4 , and have seen that the obtained parameters do not allow the bound state of @xmath2 . at finite temperature , we have calculated the temperature dependence of @xmath1 , and have found that the lattice data up to @xmath126 are reproduced with a constant six - point coupling constant @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the @xmath0 symmetry is not restored up to @xmath126 , and we are led to the conclusion that within the present framework , the effective restoration of the @xmath0 symmetry and the chiral phase transition do not necessarily occur simultaneously even though the rapid dropping of @xmath1 around the chiral transition , observed in the lattice simulation , seemingly suggest the simultaneous restoration . at high temperatures",
    ", we can not state anything definitely because of the absence of the lattice data .",
    "we have shown , however , that if @xmath1 is suppressed exponentially , the @xmath0 symmetry is allowed to be restored at high temperatures .",

    "therefore we would say that the parameter setting by using @xmath4 is somewhat obscure . our approach proposed in this article",

    "<S> the value for @xmath1 is taken from lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate @xmath1 at finite temperature within the model . comparing it with the lattice data , we extract information about the behavior of the @xmath0 anomaly at finite temperature . </S>",
