    "the complementarity principle has been both theoreticallyand experimentallystudied in the framework of mach  zehnder ( mz ) interferometrics .",
    "the mz framework is particularly suitable for discussions regarding wave  particle duality , and there is a debate concerning the complementarity of the fringe - visibility observable ( wave aspect ) and the which - way - has - passed question ( particle aspect ) . in this regard , the wave and particle properties",

    "does not involve any mention of inherent fluctuations in the measured quantities .",
    "inspired in this quantitative similarity , we are interested in looking deeper at the connection between these two important principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "specifically , we address the question : is eq .",
    "the expression of an uncertainty relation ?",
    "this basic issue has been the subject of intense debate in the literature .",
    "answers in both the affirmative and the negative have been provided by various authors  ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "our goal is , with regards to eq .  , to shed some new light on the issue by considering several ways of quantifying uncertainty , concentrating attention on variance - based and entropy - based inequalities .",
    "the article s outline is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ s : mach - zehnder ] we review details of the discussion concerning the duality relation  , introducing relevant operators that account for the path information and fringe visibility in double - slit - like experiments . sect .",
    "[ s : uncertaintyrelations ] is devoted to summarize various formulations of the uncertainty principle that were applied to our problem , i.e.  for a pair of two - level discrete operators , by employing variances as well as entropic and other measures . in sect .",
    "[ s : relationship ] we provide an affirmative answer to the question posed in the case of the uncertainty inequalities prescribed by shrdinger ",
    "robertson and by landau  pollak , demonstrating the full equivalence between them .",
    "additionally , our analysis of a class of entropic uncertainty inequalities shows that they are not on the same footing as the above ones but that they yield nonetheless nontrivial information about the system .",
    "this is achieved by studying states that saturate the entropic inequality .",
    "we find that , according to the value of the rnyi parameter , different regimes can be discerned , a fact that can be interpreted as giving support to previous investigations  @xcite . finally , some conclusions are drawn in sect .",

    "the mach  zehnder interferometer ( fig .",
    "[ f : figure1 ] ) is a device that has been used in several branches of physics , in particular , for the study of the complementarity principle .",
    "an important quantity is the `` _ _ which way _ _ '' information , that is quantified by the _ predictability _ @xmath0 defined as @xmath3 ,",
    "where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the probabilities of the particle taking path  + \" or path  - \" , respectively . on the other hand , the _ fringe visibility _",
    "is quantified via a natural extension of the usual measure for intensity of light , that is @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the probability that the particle be detected in some position in space , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 denoting , respectively , the maximum and minimum of this probability .",
    "the quantitative formulation of cp in the mz - interferometer scheme is the celebrated duality relation  @xcite given by eq .  , where the equal sign holds ( only ) for pure states .",
    "this relation was also implicitly alluded to in the pioneering works of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the mz interferometer , having two relevant spatial modes , can be represented by a two - dimensional hilbert space spanned for instance by @xmath11 , which is the so - called computational basis .",
    "the states @xmath12 and @xmath13 are eigenstates of the pauli spin operator @xmath14 , representing the two paths .",
    "we use the bloch representation to describe quantum density operators as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote the pauli matrices , @xmath17 is the @xmath18 identity matrix , and @xmath19 is the bloch vector ( with @xmath20 ) that characterizes the state .",
    "the action of the beam splitter can be described by the unitary transformation @xmath21 , which implies a rotation of @xmath22 of the bloch vector around the @xmath23-axis .",
    "the phase shifter @xmath24 introduces a phase difference equal to @xmath25 between the paths .    following ref .",
    "@xcite , a sharp observable @xmath26 can be associated to the predictability , while two families of sharp observables @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be associated to the visibility .",
    "it is possible to express these operators in terms of the pauli spin ones as @xmath29 with @xmath25 ranging , in principle , between 0 and @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are a set of mutually complementary observables , that is , if one is certain about the value of one observable , then maximum ignorance reigns concerning the value of any of the other two .    for a system in state @xmath31 ( with bloch vector @xmath32 ) the predictability @xmath0",
    "is obtained by taking the modulus of the expectation value of observable @xmath26 :  @xmath33 .",
    "the visibility @xmath1 can be derived either from the observable @xmath27 or from @xmath28 by properly choosing the parameter  @xmath25 . defining @xmath31 as @xmath34 , the auxiliary state variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 allow us to write  @xmath37 and  @xmath38 .",
    "thus the visibility , which is given by the maximum absolute expectation value of these observables , is equal to @xmath39 and can be obtained using @xmath27 if one sets @xmath40 , or @xmath28 setting @xmath41 ( arranging the apparatus with a phase difference of @xmath42 with respect to these angles gives also the same value of visibility ) .",
    "finally , due to the positivity of the density matrix , the complementarity relation   is directly obtained : @xmath43 and it is seen to be saturated whenever @xmath44 , i.e.  for any pure state .",
    "we note that the measurements of the two observables   and  , or   and  , can only be carried out in two _ incompatible _ experimental set - ups and that joint measurement is not involved .",
    "therefore the trade off relation   expresses the _ preparation complementarity _",
    "@xcite , that is the impossibility to prepare the system in a state where the two observables have simultaneously sharp values .",
    "the uncertainty principle  ( up ) states that the probability distributions associated to the outcomes of two incompatible observables can not be simultaneously sharp . quantitative formulations of the up are known as _ uncertainty relations _  ( ur ) , and there is now a collection of inequalities that express this principle ( see , for instance , the recent review articles  @xcite ) . before summarizing the up formulations to be employed , let us introduce the relevant quantities and fix the notation .    in general , the state of an @xmath45-level system is described by a density operator @xmath31 , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",

    "variance - based up formulations have been doubly criticized .",
    "on the one hand , the lower bound to the product of variances depends , in general , on the state of the system via the expectation values and thus lacks a universal character  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it can be easily seen  @xcite that for discrete , bounded operators the lower bound is trivially zero , yielding no valuable information . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of the variance as measure of uncertainty ( spreading ) of a given probability distribution exhibits some limitations  @xcite .",
    "it might also be the case that the variance is not well - defined .",
    "an alternative up formulation was introduced by landau and pollak ( lp ) in the context of time - frequency analysis  @xcite , and adapted to the quantum framework by maassen and uffink  @xcite . using the notation @xmath76 for the maximum probability of the outcomes of observable @xmath48 ,",
    "then the lp uncertainty relation reads @xmath77 the lp relation captures the essence of the uncertainty principle for quantum pure state , indeed the rhs is state - independent .",
    "a generalization of a weak version of the lp inequality for positive operator valued measures was recently given in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an application of this inequality to separability problems was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath45-dimensional systems ,",
    "the extension of   to general ( mixed ) states is not obvious , due to the lack of definite concavity of @xmath78 .",
    "however , for two - dimensional systems it can been shown that the lp relation remains valid for mixed states .",
    "for our purposes , we express the lp inequality   as @xmath79 [ 1-m_{\\infty}(b ) ] } \\leq c\\ ] ] where we have used the trigonometric identity  @xmath80 for @xmath81  @xcite , and that @xmath82 is a decreasing function . in our 2d case , using   , we have @xmath83      information - theory tools have shown their usefulness in the study of uncertainty relations  @xcite .",

    "pollak uncertainty relation .",

    "this implies that the duality relation   can be deduced from the lp inequality , and viceversa .",

    "our goal is to find the minimum of the sum of these rnyi entropies over all available states , that is , @xmath136 .",
    "appealing to the concavity of rnyi entropy for @xmath137 $ ] , we can restrict our calculations to pure states and then the conditioned minimization problem can be recast in the fashion @xmath138 for arbitrary values of @xmath91 , this problem can be solved numerically .",
    "it is seen that three qualitatively different regimes appear : ( i )  for @xmath139 with @xmath140 , the minimum is @xmath113 and it is attained at @xmath141 and @xmath142 , or @xmath143 and @xmath144 ; ( ii )  at @xmath145 the minimum value is also @xmath113 but it corresponds to the cases @xmath141 and @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , or also @xmath146 ; and ( iii )  for @xmath147 , the minimum is the @xmath91-dependent function @xmath148 $ ] , attained at @xmath146 .",

    "width=302 ]    the existence of these three regimes sheds light on the meaning of the sum of rnyi entropies .",
    "the fact that there appear three qualitatively different regimes agrees with a result suggested in previous work  @xcite , where different values of the parameter @xmath91 yield different entropic measures which , in turn , give rise to qualitatively different information about the system .",
    "as stated before , information - theoretic entropy gives a measure of the uncertainty related to the outcome of a variable in terms of the corresponding probability distribution .",
    "thus , solving the problem raised in   we get the minimum of the sum of uncertainties ( notice that in this spirit we are using the same @xmath91 parameter for both entropies ) .",
    "we are also able to pinpoint the optimum ( minimizing ) states of this problem .",
    "states which saturate an uncertainty relation are used in several contexts .",
    "an important example has to do with coherent states , which saturate the position ",
    "momentum heisenberg ur . because of having this property , coherent states are usually interpreted as the most classical ones . in the present case ,",
    "in which we consider the predictability  visibility relation in the context of the mz interferometer , we find that regime ( i ) is a trivial one , being the eigenstates of @xmath126 or @xmath122 those states of minimum uncertainty sum",
    ". however , an interesting non - trivial situation appears in regimes  ( ii ) and  ( iii ) , where the extremum is attained at the symmetric case . which are the characteristic features of states which make @xmath160 ?",
    "they are the pure states of the form with the four different unit bloch vectors :   @xmath161 .",
    "these are precisely the states which saturate the concomitant eurs in the most unbiased way ( in the sense of simultaneously having the maximum visibility _ and _ maximum predictability that is possible ) .",
    "let us consider in more detail the question of getting the states with maximum value for both predictability and visibility , a situation which one expects to correspond to the best description of the system . from simple geometric arguments in the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane ( taking into account",
    "that @xmath162 has to be fulfilled ) , it is straightforward how to compute those states .",
    "however , one may deal as well with a situation in which one does not have at hand the whole set of states available , but only a fraction of it . in such circumstances , it is convenient to delve further into the usefulness of the minimization of the measure @xmath163 ( when @xmath164 ) .",
    "for example , this situation may appear if the source in fig .",
    "[ f : figure1 ] has limitations for producing certain states , and one is thus restricted to deal with a given region of the convex set of quantum states .",
    "another interesting situation has to do with the case in which the second beam splitter is a schrdinger cat ( as is the case in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) or if there is a noisy environment . in both situations ,",
    "the states of the system which pass trough the interferometer are limited by the state of the environment ( and can not be controlled , in the second case ) , being mixed states the more general case .",
    "thus , not all states are available and   gives a way to solve the problem posed by conditions mentioned above in this non - symmetrical setting .",
    "we studied here connections between the complementarity and uncertainty principles in the mach ",
    "zehnder interferometer scheme .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite and related work , we employed quantum - mechanical operators @xmath122 and @xmath126 to represent the particle and wave aspects of a quantum system , respectively .",
    "we have thoroughly analyzed some drawbacks concerning the approaches of bjrk _ et al .",
    "_ , and of drr and rempe , who considered the link between the inequality   and variance - based uncertainty relations of the form  .",
    "we showed the _ equivalence _ between the schrdinger ",
    "robertson ur and the duality relation in the relevant case , i.e.  for observables which adequately represent predictability and visibility according to  @xcite .",
    "an alternative quantification of the uncertainty principle is given by the landau ",
    "pollak inequality  .",
    "we proved the equivalence between   and the lp - ur ( as specified for the observables of interest ) .",
    "it is worth stressing then that in the present context the three inequalities  ,   and  , are on an equal footing ( which may well not be the case for other pairs of observables ) .",
    "we remark that our results give a precise ( and quantitative ) meaning to the assertion _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 are complementary quantities _ and , at the same time , settle pending question regarding the status of   as an uncertainty relation .",
    "moreover , we have studied the connection between   and entropic uncertainty relations   based on the @xmath91-rnyi entropy  .",
    "we found that these eurs , for the pair @xmath122-@xmath126 , are not equivalent to the duality relation .",
    "nevertheless , we see that , when these uncertainty measures are applied to the mz scheme , different regimes emerge , depending on the value of the entropic parameter  @xmath91 . we also noticed that this agrees with a previous investigation by luis  @xcite , in which the value chosen for @xmath91 affects the qualitative behavior of the uncertainty relations .",
    "the fact that these different regimes are also found in the canonical example of mz interferometry seems to provide support to the assertion _ there is no preferred value for @xmath91_. indeed , different @xmath91-values render the concomitant entropic measures useful for different purposes .",
    "in addition , looking at the states which correspond to an equality in the entropic uncertainty relation , we find regimes with nontrivial saturating states .",
    "we have in this vein established a procedure for solving the problem of finding a state having minimum uncertainty for the observables @xmath122 and @xmath126 in the most unbiased fashion .",
