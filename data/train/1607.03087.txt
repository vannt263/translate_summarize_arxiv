    "this paper has three main theorems . one of them ( theorem [ almostmain ] ) is about lifting of biadjoints : a generalization of theorem 4.4 of @xcite .",
    "the others ( theorem [ goal ] and theorem [ goal2 ] ) are consequences of the former on lifting biadjoints to the @xmath1-category of lax algebras .",
    "these results can be seen as part of what is called _ two - dimensional universal algebra _ , or , more precisely , _ two - dimensional monad theory _ : for an idea of the scope of this field ( with applications ) , see for instance @xcite .",
    "there are several theorems about lifting of adjunctions in the literature  @xcite , including , for instance , adjoint triangle theorems  @xcite .",
    "although some of these results can be proved for enriched categories or more general contexts  @xcite , they often are not enough to deal with problems within @xmath1-dimensional category theory .",
    "the reason is that these problems involve concepts that are not of ( strict / usual ) @xmath10-enriched category theory nature , as it is explained in @xcite .",
    "for example , in @xmath1-dimensional category theory , the enriched notion of monad , the @xmath11-monad , gives rise to the @xmath1-category of ( strict / enriched ) algebras , but it also gives rise to the @xmath1-category of pseudoalgebras and the @xmath1-category of lax algebras .",
    "the last two types of @xmath1-categories of algebras are usually of the most interest despite the fact that they are not `` strict '' notions .    in short , most of the aspects of @xmath1-dimensional universal algebra are not covered by the usual @xmath10-enriched category theory of @xcite or by the _ formal theory of monads _ of @xcite . actually , in the context of pseudomonad theory , the appropriate analogue of the formal theory of monads is the formal theory ( and definition ) of pseudomonads of @xcite . in this direction",
    ", the problem of lifting biadjunctions is the appropriate analogue of the problem of lifting adjunctions .",
    "some results on lifting of biadjunctions are consequences of the biadjoint triangle theorems proved in @xcite .",
    "one of these consequences is the following : let @xmath0 be a pseudomonad on a @xmath1-category @xmath2 .",
    "assume that @xmath12 , @xmath13 are pseudofunctors such that we have the pseudonatural equivalence below .",
    "if @xmath14 is right biadjoint then @xmath15 is right biadjoint as well provided that @xmath5 has some needed codescent objects .",

    "this allows us to prove `` general coherence results ''  @xcite which encompass many coherence results  such as the strict replacement of monoidal categories , the strict / flexible replacement of bicategories  @xcite , the strict / flexible replacement of pseudofunctors  @xcite and so on  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath17 is a @xmath1-monad , the result described above gives the construction ( due to lack  @xcite ) of the left biadjoint to the inclusion @xmath18 subject to the existence of some codescent objects in @xmath19 .",
    "the strict version of the biadjoint triangle theorem of @xcite shows when we can get a genuine left @xmath1-adjoint to this inclusion ( and also studies when the unit is a pseudonatural equivalence ) , getting the coherence results of @xcite w.r.t .",
    "pseudoalgebras .    in this paper , we prove theorem [ almostmain ] which is a generalization of theorem 4.3 of @xcite on biadjoint triangles .",
    "our result allows us to study lifting of biadjunctions to lax algebras .",
    "hence , we prove the analogue of the result described above for lax algebras .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a pseudomonad on a @xmath1-category @xmath2 and let @xmath20 be the locally full inclusion of the @xmath1-category of lax @xmath0-algebras and @xmath0-pseudomorphisms into the @xmath1-category of lax @xmath0-algebras and lax @xmath0-morphisms .",

    "moreover , @xmath21 is right biadjoint if and only if @xmath5 has lax codescent objects of some special diagrams .",
    "still , we study when we can get strict left @xmath1-adjoints to @xmath15 and @xmath9 , provided that @xmath22 is a @xmath1-functor .    as an immediate application",
    ", we also prove general coherence theorems related to the work of @xcite : we get the construction of the left biadjoints of the inclusions @xmath23 provided that @xmath17 is a @xmath1-monad , @xmath0 is a pseudomonad and @xmath19 , @xmath24 have some needed lax codescent objects .",
    "we start in section [ bilimits ] establishing our setting : we recall basic results and definitions , such as weighted bicolimits and computads . in section [ lift ] , we give our main theorems on lifting of biadjoints : these are simple but pretty general results establishing basic techniques to prove theorems on lifting of biadjoints .",
    "these techniques apply to the context of @xcite but also apply to the study of other biadjoint triangles , such as our main application - which is the lifting of biadjoints to the @xmath1-category of lax algebras",
    ".    then , we restrict our attention to @xmath1-dimensional monad theory : in order to do so , we present the weighted bicolimits called lax codescent objects and codescent objects in section [ descent ] .",
    "our approach to deal with descent objects is more general than the approach of @xcite , since it allows us to study descent objects of more general diagrams .",
    "thanks to this approach , in section [ laxalgebras ] , after defining pseudomonads and lax algebras , we show how we can get the category of pseudomorphisms between two lax algebras as a descent object at proposition [ laxeffectivedescent ] .",
    "this result also shows how we can get the category of lax morphisms between two lax algebras as a lax descent object .    in section [ l ] ,",
    "we prove our main results on lax algebras : theorem [ goal ] and theorem [ goal2 ] .",
    "they are direct consequences of the results of section [ lift ] and section [ laxalgebras ] , but we also give explicit calculations of the weighted bicolimits / weighted @xmath1-colimits needed in @xmath5 to get the left biadjoints / left @xmath1-adjoints .",
    "we finish the paper in section [ straightforward ] giving straightforward applications of our results within the context of the @xmath1-monadic approach to coherence explained above .",
    "this work was realized in the course of my phd studies at university of coimbra .",
    "i wish to thank my supervisor maria manuel clementino for her support , attention and useful feedback .",
    "in this section , we recall some basic results related to our setting , which is the tricategory @xmath25 of @xmath1-categories , pseudofunctors , pseudonatural transformations and modifications . most of what we need was originally presented in @xcite .",
    "also , for elements of enriched category theory , see @xcite .",
    "we use the notation established in section 2 of @xcite for pseudofunctors , pseudonatural transformations and modifications .",
    "we start with considerations about size .",
    "let @xmath26 be the cartesian closed _ category of small categories_. also , assume that @xmath27 are cartesian closed categories of categories in two different universes such that @xmath28 is an internal category of @xmath29 , while @xmath10 is itself an internal category of @xmath30 .",
    "since these three categories of categories are complete and cartesian closed , they are enriched over themselves and they are cocomplete and complete in the enriched sense .    henceforth , _",
    "@xmath10-category _ is a @xmath29-enriched category such that its collection of objects is a discrete category of @xmath30 .",
