    "for many years , the neutral kaon system was the only place in which the violation of @xmath1 symmetry was observed@xcite .",
    "the last decade has witnessed an intensive effort to record and interpret as many cases of @xmath1 violation in neutral and charged @xmath4 mesons as possible .",
    "the cdf and d0 experiments now , for the first time , are able to extend the search for @xmath1 violation to the neutral @xmath0 meson .",
    "this system combines observable fast particle - antiparticle oscillations familiar from the @xmath5 system , with an observable separation into distinct lifetime states best known from the neutral kaon system .",
    "@xmath1 violation in the @xmath0 system , the subject of this paper , contains some elements resembling @xmath1 violation in the kaon system , and others that resemble @xmath1 violation in the @xmath5 system .",
    "one of the manifestations of the large @xmath1 violation in the neutral @xmath5 is the @xmath1 asymmetry in certain decays such as @xmath8 .",
    "this @xmath1 asymmetry is characterized by the angle @xmath9 of the unitarity triangle , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unitarity1 ] .",
    "the groundbreaking measurements@xcite of the angle @xmath3 stand out from the dozen or so other measurements of @xmath1 violation@xcite , because the measurement is experimentally clean and the prediction is largely free from theoretical uncertainties . in the neutral @xmath0 system ,",
    "the same comments apply to the decay @xmath6 , where one can measure the quantity @xmath10 an angle of the `` squashed '' ( bs ) unitarity triangle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : unitarity2 ] ) , whose standard model value is @xmath11 0.019 @xmath12 0.001 , where @xmath13=0.2257@xmath14 and @xmath150.349@xmath16 are parameters of the ckm matrix@xcite .",
    "it is measurable@xcite in the decay @xmath6 , through the interference of mixing and decay .",
    "the measurement is sensitive to new physics , particularly if it affects the @xmath17 transition .",
    "one such scenario is discussed in reference @xcite .    ,",
    "measured precisely in decays like @xmath18 at the b - factories .",
    "all sides of this triangle are @xmath19,width=302 ]    , the angle at the most acute vertex of the triangle .",
    "this triangle has two sides of length o(@xmath20 ) and a third side of length o(@xmath21 ) . for comparison the ( bd ) unitarity triangle",

    "it is useful to think of the @xmath1-mixed @xmath22 as three distinct final states , characterized either by the orbital angular momentum of the two vector mesons @xmath23 and @xmath24 , or by their relative polarization @xmath25 , where the first symbol indicates longitudinal polarization vectors , the second indicates transverse polarization vectors which are mutually parallel , and the third indicates transverse polarization vectors which are mutually perpendicular .",
    "we designate the three states as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 the first two being @xmath1-even and the third @xmath1-odd .",
    "it is also useful to think of the @xmath0 as two distinct initial states , the long - lived `` heavy '' and short - lived `` light '' mesons : latexmath:[\\[|b_s^h\\rangle = p\\,|b_s^0\\rangle - q\\,|\\bar b_s^0\\rangle ,   \\hspace*{0.9 cm }     @xmath1 violation in this system presents itself in two ways . if @xmath30\\ne 0 $ ] then the long- and short - lived mass eigenstates are _ not _",

    "this is reminiscent of the neutral kaon system .",
    "additionally , the expectation value @xmath31 from an initially pure @xmath0 or @xmath32 evolves with time : @xmath33 .",
    "the time evolution is an oscillation with @xmath0 mixing frequency of @xmath34=17.77 @xmath12 0.10 @xmath12 0.07 ps@xmath35@xcite .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath1 expectation reflects itself in a time - dependent polarization of the two vector mesons , and finally in a time variation of the angular distributions of their decay products .",
    "this is similar to the situation in the @xmath5 system , particularly in the @xmath36 decay @xmath37 .",
    "the cdf and d0 analyses , which fit the differential rate of @xmath38 , are simultaneously sensitive to both effects .    the time - dependent rates for initially pure @xmath0 and @xmath32 are @xmath39 @xcite where @xmath40 is the direction of the @xmath41 in the rest frame of the @xmath23",
    ", @xmath42 is the helicity angle in the @xmath24 decay , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are complex vectors , described below , reflecting the time - dependent polarization . a coordinate system is needed to express the vectors @xmath40 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 : two common choices are the _ transversity basis _ , and the _",
    "helicity basis_. the transversity basis has the @xmath47-axis along the @xmath24 direction in the rest frame of the @xmath4 , the @xmath48-axis lying in the decay plane of the @xmath24 such that @xmath490 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the helicity basis is a cyclic permutation of the axes in the transversity basis : @xmath51 , etc .",

    "or , one can try to measure the differential rates for @xmath0 and @xmath32 separately , using a technique called flavor tagging .",
    "[ eqn : master ] contains a lot of hidden richness , including a measurable width difference between two mass eigenstates , @xmath1 asymmetries that are measurable in a flavor - tagged analysis , with simultaneous sensitivity to _ both _ @xmath58 and @xmath59 . even without flavor",
    "tagging , a residual sensitivity to @xmath1 violation is present .",
    "this arises partly due to the ability to detect the decay of the short - lived , nominally @xmath1-even mass eigenstate to the @xmath1-odd polarization states ( and vice - versa ) , which was historically the basis of the first observation of @xmath1 violation .",
    "and partly it arises from the interference between the even and odd polarization states of the vector mesons , which are , in fact `` intermediate '' , not `` final '' states . even in the case that @xmath30=0",

    "in each event one measures , in addition to the proper decay time @xmath60 , the kinematic quantities @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "three significant detector effects alter the theoretical model ( eq .  [ eqn : master ] ) . first , measurement uncertainty smears significantly the oscillatory time dependence of the rates .",
    "second , the flavor tagging algorithms in use at the tevatron give very limited discrimination between @xmath0 and @xmath32 mesons .",
    "third , the detector acceptance alters the angular distributions in eq .",
    "[ eqn : master ] .",
    "the first two effects limit the measurements , while the third does not have a significant impact if properly accounted for .",
    "flavor tagging is an essential ingredient for many studies of @xmath4 mixing and @xmath1 violation .",
    "flavor tagging endeavors to determine , from the tracks lying near to , or far from , a reconstructed meson , the flavor of that meson ( @xmath5 or @xmath64 , @xmath0 or @xmath32 ) at production . in a decay of a neutral @xmath4 meson to a flavor - specific final state",
    ", the flavor at production could be different from the flavor at decay , while , in a decay to a @xmath1 eigenstate like @xmath22 , the flavor at decay is undetermined .",
    "three independent flavor - tagging algorithms are currently in use at cdf and d0 ; these are categorized as _ same - side _ tagging or _ opposite - side _ tagging algorithms .",
    "same - side tagging establishes@xcite , on a statistical basis , the @xmath65-hadron flavor through its correlation with the charge of nearby fragmentation tracks .",
    "two varieties of opposite side tagging establish the flavor of the @xmath65-hadron on the away side , from which one infers the flavor of the near side @xmath4 meson .",
    "opposite side lepton tagging uses a soft lepton on the away side , while opposite side jet charge tagging uses the charge of a jet on the away side .",
    "the efficiency @xmath66 of any tagging algorithm is the fraction of the events to which it can be applied .",
    "the tagging algorithm also estimates its uncertainty .",
    "the tag decision being a discrete variable , the uncertainty is quantified by the dilution @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the frequency of a right decision and @xmath69 is the frequency of a wrong decision .",
    "the effective tagging efficiency , @xmath70 , is the figure - of - merit for a tagging algorithm and can be related directly@xcite to the expected uncertainty in mixing and @xmath1 asymmetry measurements asymmetry , one can not use the formula @xmath71 , developed for that purpose . ] . despite rather different tracking and particle identification technologies , cdf and d0 both report very similar effective tagging efficiencies , @xmath72 4.7% in d0 and @xmath72 4.8% in cdf .",
    "another important feature of the detector systems used in the analysis is their proper time resolution . in a mixing or @xmath1 measurement",
    ", proper time resolution further degrades the uncertainty on @xmath1 asymmetries by the factor @xmath73 . both cdf and d0",
    "now employ low - mass , small - radius silicon detectors called `` layer 00 '' , mounted directly on the beampipe , to achieve the best possible resolution , under 25 @xmath74 m in both experiments .",
    "this is discussed more fully in reference@xcite .",
    "the differential rates in eq .",
    "[ eqn : master ] are sensitive to the @xmath1 phase @xmath2 , the decay width difference @xmath75 , the mean lifetime @xmath76 , and the amplitudes @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , with phases @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and zero , normalized such that @xmath82 = 1 .",

    "[ eqn : master ] is convolved with an event dependent proper time resolution , adjusted for detector acceptance and re - normalized according to one of several schemes . in the tagged analyses ,",
    "event dependent dilutions are also incorporated into the probability densities .",
    "the simultaneous transformation @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 , is an exact symmetry of the differential rates , so , decays of @xmath6 alone can not resolve the corresponding ambiguity .",
    "this symmetry is an experimental headache , and has a significant impact on results from the experiments , particularly since , with presently available statistics , the two solutions are not well separated .",
    "untagged analyses possess an even higher degree of symmetry , since the simultaneous transformation @xmath87 , @xmath88 is also an exact symmetry .",
    "cdf performs an analysis without flavor tagging on a 1.7 fb@xmath35 sample of data@xcite , and with flavor tagging@xcite on a 1.35 fb@xmath35 sample .",
    "the former is used for sm fits ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath1 fits ( @xmath90 ) , while the latter is used only for @xmath1 fits .",
    "d0 performs both sm and @xmath1 fits to a 2.8 fb@xmath35 sample of tagged data@xcite .",
    "mass distributions of the signals from the two experiments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : datasamples ] . in the cdf untagged analysis",
    ", the sm fit obtains the results shown in table  [ table : standardmodelfits ] .",
    "this set includes an important measurement of @xmath75 , as well as an interesting measurement @xmath56 , consistent with the hqet expectation@xcite that @xmath56 = ( 1.00@xmath120.01)@xmath91 where @xmath92=1.530@xmath12 0.009 ps is the world average @xmath93 lifetime .",
    "the amplitudes are consistent with those measured@xcite in the related decay @xmath94 .",
    "point estimates are not obtained for the strong phases , since the measurement is insensitive to @xmath80 for @xmath95 while for @xmath81 the likelihood is nonparabolic ( a result of the symmetries referred to in section  [ section : methods ] ) .",
    "@xmath1 fits in the untagged analysis , do not yield point estimates for any of the physics parameters .",
    "they do give , however , a feldman - cousins confidence region@xcite shown in fig .",
