    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be divided into black  hole candidates ( bhcs ) and neutron  star lmxbs .",
    "the accretion process in these lmxbs can be studied through the timing properties of the associated x - ray emission ( see for an overview van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "the fourier power spectra of the neutron  star lmxbs contain several timing features ; a power  law red noise component in the lowest frequency range of the spectrum ( @xmath1 1 hz ) called very low frequency noise ( vlfn ) , a band  limited noise component ( bln ) which is in most cases flat at low frequency and steepens to an approximate power ",
    "law with an index of about 1 at higher frequency and several quasi  periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at low ( @xmath2 hz ) and high frequencies .",
    "the high frequency qpos , at frequencies from a few hundred hz to more than 1000 hz are called kilohertz qpos . the correlation",
    "between the timing features at low frequency and the spectral properties led to a precise classification of the neutron star systems as z or atoll sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "note , that the component that we call bln has been previously called `` high  frequency noise '' in atoll sources ; this is presumably the same phenomenon that is called `` low  frequency noise '' in z sources ( cf .",
    "van der klis 1995 ) .",
    "the timing features of the bhcs include among others a band  limited noise component , a bump between 1 and 10 hz and several qpos .",
    "for the low  frequency ( @xmath3 hz ) part of the power spectrum links between bhcs in the low state and neutron ",
    "star lmxbs were suggested ( e.g. , van der klis 1994a , b ) , in particular concerning the band  limited noise and some of the qpos .",
    "the improved sensitivity and the discovery of several new timing features with the rossi x  ray timing explorer ( rxte ) has opened up new possibilities for connecting the timing properties of the neutron ",

    "( 2000 , hereafter vs00 ) found that the relation between power density and break frequency of the band  limited noise was similar to that established for bhcs in the low state .",
    "wijnands & van der klis ( 1999 , hereafter wk99 ) showed that the break frequency of the band  limited noise and the centroid frequency of a low  frequency qpo follow the same correlation for both the neutron ",

    "psaltis , belloni & van der klis ( 1999 , hereafter pbk99 ) made a systematic study of qpos and broad  band noise components of the neutron ",
    "star lmxbs and the bhcs .",
    "they suggested the identification of two features by plotting their frequencies versus each other .",
    "the bhcs high  frequency bump between 1 and 10 hz was tentatively identified with the lower kilohertz qpo in the z and atoll sources and the bhcs low  frequency qpo with the horizontal branch oscillations / low  frequency qpo in the z / atoll sources .",
    "recently , nowak ( 2000 ) described the power spectra of the bhcs gx 3394 and cyg x1 with a fit function consisting of four lorentzian components and suggested the identification of the two highest frequency lorentzians , which together describe the high  frequency end of the broad  band noise , with the two kilohertz qpos .",
    "the lorentzian that is used to fit the low  frequency end of the broad  band noise has a centroid frequency fixed to zero .",
    "the additional lorentzian fits a bump at low frequencies . in the picture of nowak ( 2000 ) for the bhcs the first lorentzian corresponds to the broken power law of wk99 , the second lorentzian to the low",
    "frequency qpo of wk99 and pbk99 and the third lorentzian to the high  frequency bump between 1 and 10 hz of pbk99 .",
    "this work forms the original motivation for the current paper .",

    "luminosity bursters and bhcs in their low / hard state .",
    "they describe the power spectra of these sources with a fit function consisting of four lorentzian components of which in practice three are zero  centered .",
    "the suggestion of nowak ( 2000 ) might be tested by comparing his black hole results with neutron star sources , where both kilohertz qpos can be clearly identified and strong broad  band noise is simultaneously present : the prediction for the neutron star sources is that if the two kilohertz qpos are present the two high  frequency lorentzians should be absent from the broad  band noise . in this work",

    "lorentzian fit function of nowak ( 2000 ) and bpk01 on two of the atoll sources , namely 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 .",
    "the timing properties at low and high frequencies of 4u 172834 and 4u 0614 + 09 have previously been studied in connection with color diagrams by vs00 for 4u 0614 + 09 and di salvo et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter ds01 ) .",

    "power spectra were combined based on the position in the color diagram , which is thought to be an indicator of mass accretion rate .",

    "we use a large data set previously studied by vs00 plus recent observations performed between 2000 september 1 and 4 and 2001 may 24 and 28 . in the september 2000 observations the source was at levels corresponding to the lowest mass accretion rate ( as inferred from colors and power  spectral properties ) observed by vs00 . in the may 2001 observations the inferred mass accretion rate was at an even lower level . starting",
    "may 12 , 2000 , the propane layer on pcu0 , which functions as an anti  coincidence shield for charged particles , was lost .",
    "this leads to a contamination of the data from electrons trapped in the earth s magnetosphere or from solar flare activity .",
    "for the september 2000 and may 2001 observations we therefore exclude all data with electron2 @xmath4 0.09 , where electron2 is the measured coincidence of events between the pcu propane layer and either of the two anodes in the first layer of pcu2 , the only detector that was switched on in all the observations .",
    "the electron2 screening led to a loss of about 12% of the data .",
    "the loss of the propane layer in pcu0 also leads to an increased background rate for pcu0 .",
    "we approximately take this into account by adding 30% of the pcu0 background rate to the total background rate . for the colors used above we have excluded pcu0 .    in vs00",
    "the 4u 0614 + 09 data were split into near ",
    "continuous time intervals of approximately 2500 s which were called observations . for the present work , to improve statistics , we constructed representative intervals by adding up several observations that showed very similar power spectra in vs00 .",
    "as all characteristic frequencies in the power spectra are correlated with each other and with the position of the source in the hardness  intensity diagram ( parametrized in vs00 by a variable @xmath5 ) we can select the data on one of these frequencies .",
    "the only power spectral feature that is present in all observations is the high  frequency noise .",
    "however , at a @xmath6 ( the break frequency of the band  limited noise , see for a definition vs00 ) of about 25 hz and higher the correlation with the other frequencies and with the position in hardness ",
    "intensity diagram breaks down ( see figures 3 and 6 in vs00 ) . therefore , for a @xmath6 well below 25 hz we used @xmath6 to select the data and for a @xmath6 of about 25 hz and higher we used the centroid frequencies of the kilohertz qpos . to represent the highest mass accretion rate in 4u 0614 + 09 ( where the kilohertz qpos are mostly absent ) we add up the two observations at @xmath5 = 2.59 and @xmath5 = 2.64 in vs00 . as in the case of 4u 172834",

    "we note that we could have selected the data based on @xmath5 value as was done for 4u 172834 ( see above ) , but because of the scatter in the correlation of @xmath5 with the frequencies of the power spectral features ( see figures 3 and 4 in vs00 ) , in 4u 0614 + 09 this leads to an artificial broadening of the power spectral features and in the case of the kilohertz qpos sometimes even to double peaks .    for each interval of",
    "4u 0614 + 09 we constructed a power spectrum in the same fashion as for 4u 172834 ( see above ) , but with a nyquist frequency of 4096 hz .",
    "an interval contains between 53 and 382 power spectra .",
    "we subtracted the poisson noise estimated between 2000 and 4000 hz ( as , different from 4u 172834 , qpos are known to be present between 1200 and 1400 hz ) before fitting the power spectra .",
    "we fitted the power spectra with a sum of lorentzian components .",
    "one to six lorentzian components were needed for a good fit .",
    "we only include those lorentzians in the fit whose significance based on the error in the power integrated from 0 to @xmath7 is above 3.0 @xmath8 .",
    "in addition to the lorentzians a power  law component is used to fit the so called very low  frequency noise ( vlfn ) .",
    "for the intervals where the kilohertz qpos have sufficiently high frequencies not to interfere with the low  frequency features and vice",
    "versa , we fit the kilohertz qpos between 500 and 2048 hz and then fix the kilohertz qpo parameters when we fit the whole power spectra , similar to what was done in ds01 .",
    "this is for computational reasons only ; the results are the same as those obtained with all parameters free .",
    "we plot the power spectra and the fit functions in the power times frequency representation ( e.g. belloni et al .",
    "1997 , nowak 2000 ) , where the power spectral density is multiplied with its fourier frequency . for a fit function consisting of many lorentzians this representation helps to visualize a characteristic frequency corresponding to each lorentzian component ( bpk01 ) namely , the frequency where each component contributes most of its variance per logarithmic frequency interval .",
    "this characteristic frequency , is not equal to the centroid frequency , @xmath9 , of the lorentzian but to @xmath10{\\nu_0 ^ 2 + \\delta^2}$ ] , where @xmath11 is the hwhm of the lorentzian . in this work",

    "for narrow features the characteristic frequency is nearly the same as @xmath9 .",
    "all power spectral features that we find in 4u 0614 + 09 and 4u 172834 become broader towards lower interval number ( see  3 ) .",
    "several features can be classified as qpos at higher characteristic frequencies but evolve into broad bumps as their frequencies become lower . therefore , to be consistent we use @xmath0 for all features .",

    "in addition to these lorentzians , intervals 1419 of 4u 172834 and 8 and 9 of 4u 0614 + 09 needed a power  law component to fit the very low  frequency noise ( vlfn ) .",
