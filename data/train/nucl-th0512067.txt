    "after about three decades of intensive efforts in both nuclear experiments and theories , the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin symmetric nuclear matter is now relatively well determined mainly by studying collective flows in heavy - ion collisions @xcite and nuclear giant monopole resonances @xcite .",
    "the major remaining uncertainty about the eos of symmetric nuclear matter is due to our poor knowledge about the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the new challenge is to determine the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . besides the great interests in nuclear physics , the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter is also crucial in many astrophysical processes , especially in connection with the structure of neutron stars and the dynamical evolution of proto - neutron stars @xcite .",
    "fortunately , heavy - ion reactions , especially those induced by radioactive beams , provide a unique opportunity to constrain the eos of asymmetric nuclear matter ireview , ibook , baran05 .",
    "in fact , considerable progress has been made recently in determining the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy around the normal nuclear matter density from studying the isospin diffusion in heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energies mbt , chen04,li05 .",
    "however , much more work is still needed to probe the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "a crucial task is to find experimental observables that are sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "a number of such observables have been already identified in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei , such as the free neutron / proton ratio @xcite , the isospin fractionation @xcite , the neutron - proton transverse differential flow @xcite , the neutron - proton correlation function @xcite , @xmath7/@xmath8he chen03a , zhang05 , the isospin diffusion @xcite , the proton differential elliptic flow @xcite and the @xmath0 ratio @xcite .",
    "generally , the long range coulomb force on charged particles plays an important role in the above observables .",
    "it is thus important to distinguish the effects due to the symmetry potentials from those due to the coulomb potentials .",
    "it is also useful to understand the interplay between these two kinds of potentials .",
    "moreover , to extract accurately information about the symmetry energy one has to reduce as much as possible the systematic errors involved in the observables used in experiments . for this purpose one normally studies the ratios or relative values of experimental observables from two reaction systems using different isotopes of the same element .",
    "the first theoretical investigation of such an observable , the double neutron / proton ratio of pre - equilibrium nucleons , has been made recently in ref . @xcite .",
    "since the single @xmath6 ratio in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei has been shown to be a useful probe of the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite , we study here the effects of the symmetry energy on the double @xmath6 ratio from the reactions of @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn and @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn , i.e. , the ratio of @xmath0 from @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn over that from @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn , using the ibuu04 model .",
    "it is well known that the single @xmath6 ratio has a coulomb peak at certain pion kinetic energy depending on the system and the impact parameter of the reaction @xcite .",
    "it is thus especially interesting to examine the sensitivity of the double @xmath6 ratio to the symmetry energy around the coulomb peak .",
    "we find that around the coulomb peak the double @xmath0 ratio has about the same sensitivity to the symmetry energy as the single @xmath6 ratio while having the advantage of reduced systematic errors .",
    "in the ibuu04 model , besides nucleons , @xmath9 and @xmath10 resonances as well as pions and their isospin - dependent dynamics are included .",
    "the initial neutron and proton density distributions of the projectile and target are obtained by using the relativistic mean field theory .",
    "the experimental free - space nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) scattering cross sections and the in - medium nn cross sections can be used optionally . in the present work ,",
    "we use the isospin - dependent in - medium nn elastic cross sections from the scaling model according to nucleon effective masses @xcite . for the inelastic cross sections we use the experimental data from free space nn collisions since the in - medium inelastic nn cross sections are still very much controversial .",
    "the total and differential cross sections for all other particles are taken either from experimental data or obtained by using the detailed balance formula .",
    "the isospin dependent phase - space distribution functions of the particles involved are solved by using the test - particle method numerically .",
    "the isospin - dependence of pauli blockings for fermions is also considered .",
    "more details can be found in refs .",
    "ba97a , ba04a , das03,ba04,li05 .",
    "the momentum - dependent single nucleon potential ( mdi ) adopted here is @xcite@xmath11 in the above equation , @xmath12 is the isospin asymmetry parameter , @xmath13 is the baryon density and @xmath14 are the neutron and proton densities , respectively .",
    "@xmath15 for neutron ( proton ) and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the phase - space distribution function at coordinate @xmath19 and momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 were set by reproducing the momentum - dependent potential @xmath24 predicted by the gogny hartree - fock and/or the brueckner - hartree - fock calculations , the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy of about @xmath25 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter at normal density is set to be @xmath28 mev .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on the x parameter according to @xmath31where @xmath32 mev .",
    "@xmath33 is the nucleon fermi momentum in symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath34 mev and @xmath35 mev .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath36 terms are the momentum - dependent interactions of a nucleon with unlike and like nucleons in the surrounding nuclear matter .",
    "the parameter _ x _ is introduced to mimic various density - dependent symmetry energies @xmath37 predicted by microscopic and phenomenological many - body approaches @xcite .",
    "the isoscalar part @xmath38 @xcite of the single nucleon potential was shown to be in good agreement with that of the variational many - body calculations @xcite and the results of the bhf approach including three - body forces @xcite .",
    "the isovector part @xmath39 @xcite is consistent with the experimental lane potential @xcite .    and @xmath40 .",
    "taken from @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    according to essentially all microscopic model calculations , see e.g. , bom , zuo99 , the eos for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter can be expressed as @xmath41where @xmath42 is the energy per nucleon of symmetric nuclear matter , and @xmath43 is the nuclear symmetry energy . with the single particle potential @xmath44 , for a given value @xmath45",
    ", one can readily calculate the symmetry energy @xmath46 as a function of density .",
    "noticing that the isospin diffusion data from nscl / msu have constrained the value of @xmath45 to be between @xmath47 and @xmath48 for nuclear matter densities less than about @xmath49 chen04,li05 , in the present work we thus consider only the two values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ sym ] is the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy with the two @xmath45 parameters .",
    "it is seen that the case of @xmath52 gives a softer symmetry energy than that of @xmath51 and the difference becomes larger at higher densities .",
    "it was found earlier that the single @xmath6 ratio from heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei can be used to probe the high density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy ba02a , gai04,qli05a , qli05b . in fig .",
    "[ rpion ] , we show the kinetic energy distribution of the single @xmath6 ratio for the reactions of @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn and @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn at a beam energy of @xmath5 mev / nucleon and an impact parameter of @xmath53 fm with the stiff ( @xmath51 ) and soft ( @xmath52 ) symmetry energy , respectively . in order to obtain good statistics , we used @xmath54 events for each reaction in the present work .",
    "it is seen that the overall magnitude of @xmath6 ratio is larger for the neutron - rich system @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn than for the neutron - deficient system @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn as expected . for the reaction",
    "@xmath4sn+@xmath4sn the single @xmath6 ratio is not so sensitive to the symmetry energy due to the small isospin asymmetry .",
    "however , for the neutron - rich system @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn the single @xmath0 ratio is sensitive to the symmetry energy and this is consistent with previous studies @xcite .",
    "it is further seen that the soft symmetry energy ( @xmath52 ) leads to a larger single @xmath55 ratio than the stiff one ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this is mainly because the high density region where most pions are produced are more neutron - rich with the softer symmetry energy as a result of the isospin fractionation @xcite .",
    "ratio for @xmath56sn+@xmath2sn and @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn at a beam energy of @xmath5  mev / nucleon and an impact parameter of @xmath53  fm with the stiff ( @xmath51 ) and soft ( @xmath57 ) symmetry energies .",
    "the dash - dotted line is the single @xmath58  ratio obtained by turning off the coulomb potentials in the @xmath1sn+@xmath59sn reaction.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    from fig .",
    "[ rpion ] , it is also interesting to see that the single @xmath0 ratio exhibits a peak at a pion kinetic energy of about @xmath60 mev in all cases considered here . in order to understand the origin of this peak , we also calculated the single @xmath6 ratios in both reactions by turning off the coulomb potentials for all charged particles .",
    "as an example , shown in fig .",
    "[ rpion ] with the dash - dotted line is the single @xmath6 ratio obtained by turning off the coulomb potentials in the @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn reaction .",
    "it is seen that the single @xmath6 ratio now becomes approximately a constant of about @xmath61 .",
    "the latter is what one expects based on the @xmath9 resonance model stock .",
    "according to the latter the @xmath6 ratio is approximately @xmath62 in central heavy - ion reactions with @xmath63 and @xmath64 being the total neutron and proton numbers in the participant region @xcite . for central @xmath1sn+@xmath59sn reactions ,",
    "the value is about @xmath65 . at @xmath5 mev / nucleon",
    ", pions are almost exclusively produced via the @xmath9 resonances @xcite , it thus should not be a surprise to see the agreement with the @xmath9 resonance model expectation .",
    "the comparison of calculations with and without the coulomb potentials indicates clearly that the peak observed in the single @xmath6 ratio is indeed due to the coulomb effects .",
    "the @xmath55 ratio carries some information about the symmetry energy mainly because it is sensitive to the isospin asymmetry of the nucleonic matter where pions are produced .",
    "this information might be distorted but is not completely lost because of the coulomb interactions of pions with other particles .",
    "it is thus natural to look for signals of the symmetry energy in kinematic regions where the @xmath6 ratio reaches its maximum . in this regard ,",
    "the coulomb peak is actually very useful for studying the symmetry energy .",
    "it is necessary to stress that in many situations the coulomb peak will simply appear at zero instead of a finite kinetic energy .",
    "one would then need to concentrate on the @xmath6 ratio of low energy pions .",
    "in addition , it should be mentioned that most of pions are produced in the high density nucleonic matter ( about @xmath66 ) through the @xmath9 resonances and thus carry important information about the high density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "since the pions at lower kinetic energies around the coulomb peak experience many rescatterings with nucleons at high or low densities and the charged pions considered here also feel the coulomb potential from protons at different densities , the information on high density symmetry energy from the lower energy pions may be distorted partially by the low density behavior of the symmetry energy @xcite . however , in the present work , the soft ( @xmath52 ) and stiff ( @xmath51 ) symmetry energies have slight difference at low densities and the large difference appears at high densities ( about @xmath66 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ sym ] and we thus expect the observed symmetry energy effects on the energy dependence of the @xmath6 ratio mainly reflect ( though not completely ) information on the high density behavior of the symmetry energy",
    ".    ratio of @xmath56sn+@xmath2sn over @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn at a beam energy of @xmath5  mev / nucleon and an impact parameter @xmath53  fm with the stiff ( @xmath51 ) and soft ( @xmath52 ) symmetry energies.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to reduce the systematic errors , it is more useful to study the double @xmath6 ratio in the reactions of @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn and @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn .",
    "a practically critical question is whether the sensitivity to the symmetry energy observed in the single @xmath6 ratio can be sustained by the double ratio . to answer this question we examine in fig .",
    "[ drpion ] the double @xmath6 ratio for the two reactions considered .",
    "it is seen that the kinetic energy dependence of the double @xmath6 ratio is rather different for the stiff ( @xmath67 ) and soft ( @xmath52 ) symmetry energies .",
    "the double @xmath6 ratio is quite flat for @xmath52 while displaying a concave structure for @xmath51 around the coulomb peak .",
    "these different behaviors can be understood from the corresponding single @xmath6 ratios in the two reactions as shown in fig .",
    "[ rpion ] .",
    "it is reassuring to see that around the coulomb peak the double @xmath6 ratio is still sensitive to the symmetry energy .",
    "compared with the single @xmath6 ratio , the kinetic energy dependence of the double @xmath6 ratio becomes weaker .",
    "this is because the effects of the coulomb potentials are reduced in the double @xmath55 ratio .",
    "we note that the double @xmath68 ratio displays an opposite symmetry energy dependence compared with the double @xmath69 ratio for free nucleons shown in ref .",
    "this is understandable since the soft symmetry energy leads to a neutron - richer dense matter in the heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei and thus more @xmath70 s would be produced due to more neutron - neutron inelastic scatterings .",
    "since the soft symmetry energy leads to a neutron - richer dense nucleonic matter , the @xmath69 ratio for free nucleons is therefore expected to be smaller due to the charge conservation .",
    "in summary , using the isospin- and momentum - dependent hadronic transport model ibuu04 , we studied the single and double @xmath6 ratios and their dependence on the nuclear symmetry energy in the central reactions of @xmath1sn+@xmath2sn and @xmath4sn+@xmath4sn at a beam energy of @xmath5 mev / nucleon .",
    "we found that the double @xmath6 ratio retains the same sensitivity to the symmetry energy as shown by the single @xmath68 ratio around its coulomb peak in the neutron - richer system involved .",
    "these features are useful for extracting information about the nuclear symmetry energy from future experimental data .",
    "because the double @xmath0 ratio can reduce significantly the systematic errors , it is thus a more effective probe for the high - density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
