    "grb emission is widely thought to arise from the synchrotron cooling of electrons shock - heated in collisions involving ultra - relativistic shell(s ) of particles .",
    "the collisions generating the shocks may be between two adjacent shells of ejecta ( the `` internal shock '' scenario @xcite , or between an ultra - relativistic shell and the ism ( the `` external shock '' scenario @xcite ) .",
    "it has been argued that long complex bursts are most naturally explained by internal shocks @xcite ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "short , simple bursts , on the other hand , are well explained by external shocks onto a homogeneous ism . in both scenarios ,",
    "some compact , as of yet unidentified central engine must give rise to the ultra - relativistic flow .",
    "leading models for the central engine include collapsars @xcite , and the coalescence of a neutron star with another compact object @xcite .",
    "it is a principal aim of grb researchers to determine the nature of the central engine . in this work",
    "we show that , within the context of the external shock model for short bursts due to radiation - driven fireballs , existing batse and upcoming hete - ii , swift , and glast data on grb lightcurves can be used make new and interesting inferences about grb central engine parameters . in particular , we argue that the observed properties of short bursts may be used to differentiate between central engines emitting neutron rich ejecta , such as neutron star mergers , and central engines emitting neutron poor ejecta . this is interesting because neutron star mergers are at present a favored candidate for producing the timescales seen in the short class of grbs . if , indeed short bursts arise from a different class of central engines than long bursts , and do not give rise to afterglows @xcite then the results presented here may allow unique insights into the nature of these events .",
    "the new inferences we discuss are obtained by considering the dynamics of the neutron component of the fireball .",
    "the basic idea is that if strong neutron - proton scatterings become ineffective at coupling neutrons to an accelerating radiation - driven gas , then these neutrons will be left behind with a smaller average lorentz factor than the strongly coulomb - coupled protons in the gas @xcite .",
    "when this `` neutron decoupling '' occurs , the final fireball flow consists of two separate components : a fast proton shell and a slower neutron shell .",
    "when the neutrons in the slower shell decay they can shock with the decelerating proton component and give rise to a second , possibly distinct peak in the observed photon emission .",
    "this process is schematically illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "roughly what is expected in this scenario is a first burst in the gamma - ray regime followed by a second burst which can peak in the x - ray , uv , or optical band .",
    "the first burst is a signature of the outer proton shell and the second a signature of the decayed neutron shell .",
    "typically the delay between the bursts is a few milliseconds to several seconds , depending in detail on the neutron richness of the outflow and other central engine properties . the upcoming swift satellite , with a fast response time and x - ray and optical capabilities ,",
    "may be ideally suited to look for evidence of neutron decoupling .",
    "observable effects of neutron decoupling for external shocks were first considered by @xcite . here",
    "we analyze in detail implications of this idea . in that work derishev",
    "et al .  also proposed the possibility of emission resulting from the decay of neutrons after arriving at the outer proton shock radius . as we show below , it is not clear if this case can be described in terms of the standard shocks discussed in connection with grbs , and an analysis of the emission in this case has not been done .",
    "we therefore concentrate in this paper principally on the case where the neutrons decay before shocking with the outer shell , which is describable in terms of the standard theory of shocks .    in the next section",
    "we relate the observed timescales of short bursts to the necessary conditions for a decoupled neutron component to carry a substantial fraction of the fireball energy and decay before colliding with the outer shell .",
    "we also derive an interesting relation between neutron decoupling and the condition that the reverse shock in the outer shell is relativistic . in  3 we discuss the shock emission from the collision between the decoupled shell of decayed neutrons with the outer decelerating proton shell .",
    "this is similar to the work of @xcite who consider the implications of the late time emission of a slow baryon shell for the grb afterglow . in ",
    "4 we use our results to draw some interesting conclusions about the properties of grb central engines based on existing batse data . the last section is a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "we first lay the groundwork for our discussion by presenting some results from the theory describing the shocking of an ultra - relativistic proton shell on the ism .",
    "this problem has been considered by a number of authors and we refer the reader to @xcite for a review .",
    "consider a relativistic shell expanding into the ism . as the shell sweeps up the ism it decelerates and two shocks form , a forward shock propagating into the ism and a reverse shock propagating into the shell .",
    "the forward shock is generically relativistic .",
    "however , the character of the reverse shock and the details of deceleration of the fireball depend on the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath1 is the sedov length , @xmath2 is the width of the shell as measured in the observers rest frame ( _ i.e. _ the frame in which the fireball is moving at @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the total energy in the fireball , @xmath5 is the number density of the surrounding ambient ism , and @xmath6 is the proton mass .",
    "if we write the energy of the shell in units of @xmath7 as @xmath8 , the density of ism in units of @xmath9 as @xmath10 , the lorentz factor of the shell in units of @xmath11 as @xmath12 , and the width of the shell in units of @xmath13 as @xmath14 , then @xmath15 . if @xmath16 the reverse shock is relativistic and the energy conversion occurs principally in the reverse shock , while if @xmath17 the reverse shock is newtonian and energy conversion takes place principally in the forward shock",
    "interestingly , when @xmath18 initially , the shell spreads laterally as it expands and drives @xmath19 to unity before shocking .",
    "when @xmath19 is driven to unity the reverse shock becomes moderately relativistic , so that substantial energy conversion in the reverse shock also occurs in this case .",
    "we therefore focus on the case where @xmath20 at the time of substantial energy emission ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in the formulas that follow @xmath19 is taken to be unity if initially @xmath21 .",
    "the bulk of the observed emission occurs when the expanding shell slows substantially .",
    "this occurs when the energy imparted to the ism is a sizable fraction of the initial energy in the shell . for @xmath16",
    "this corresponds to the point at which the reverse shock crosses the shell . in both cases ( @xmath22 and @xmath19 driven to unity throuh spreading ) the deceleration radius is written as @xcite @xmath23 which also serves to specify the dynamic timescale for the deceleration , @xmath24 .",
    "the observed duration of the burst is then @xmath25    the above equation is uncertain to within a factor of a few owing to the decrease in @xmath3 ( deceleration ) of the shell as it propagates .",
    "the factor of @xmath26 in the denominator arises because of the relativistic motion of the shell towards the observer @xcite .",
    "the factor of @xmath27 arises because when the reverse shock is relativistic the lorentz factor has decreased by a factor of @xmath28 by the time the reverse shock crosses the shell .",
    "note that @xmath29 is equal to the width of the relativistic shell at @xmath30 .",
    "for @xmath31 lateral spreading of the shell is unimportant and @xmath29 is just equal to the duration of emission from the central engine . with the above equations in hand we can discuss the implications of observed timescales of short bursts for neutron decoupling .    for both internal and external shocks",
    "substantial baryon lorentz factors are required .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the material acquires such a large kinetic energy . in a leading scenario , the fireball model ,",
    "the baryons begin roughly at rest as part of a plasma with a large ratio of total energy to baryonic rest mass ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "thermal pressure then drives the acceleration of this plasma .",
    "protons are strongly coupled to this high entropy gas via thompson drag .",
    "neutrons , however , are effectively only coupled via strong scatterings with protons and will eventually decouple . the condition that decoupling occurs",

    "of course , if the neutrons initially present in the fireball are going to shock and lead to an observable photon signature they must first decay into protons .",
    "even after they have decayed we will still refer to the slower inner shell as the `` neutron '' shell .",
    "we note that it was argued in @xcite that in fireballs with very low initial @xmath44 , the electron fraction will be driven to @xmath45 during neutron decoupling .",

    "therefore , _ a strongly relativistic reverse shock ( @xmath16 ) implies that neutron decoupling has occurred in the progenitor fireball for essentially all reasonable fireball parameters .",
    "_    we are interested in the conditions under which a slow neutron shell decays and shocks with the outer proton shell . in order for this to occur , and in order for observable emission to result , the following conditions must be met : i ) neutron decoupling occurs and leads to a final ratio of proton to neutron lorentz factors of @xmath49 . here",

    "this is because when @xmath44 is small ( _ i.e. _ the fireball material is neutron rich ) @xmath59 can be large while still leaving a substantial portion of the energy in the neutron component .",
    "[ tltgt ] only applies for @xmath60 initially and driven to unity through spreading . note that when @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and while condition ( i ) is easily satisfied , it is not possible to express condition ( ii ) in terms of observables",
    "this is because the burst duration has no relation to @xmath63 when @xmath31 .    in order to determine the properties of the burst arising from the neutron shell and also to determine whether or not the neutrons decay before colliding with the outer shell we need to specify how the outer shell slows with time",
    "this requires knowing whether the evolution of the outer shell is adiabatic or radiative .",
    "adiabatic evolution refers to the case where the energy generated in shocks with the ism is not radiated away ( _ i.e. _ most of the post shock energy is not in the electrons ) , or is radiated away on a timescale slow compared to the dynamic time of the fireball .",
    "the evolution is radiative if all the energy generated in the shocks with the ism is effectively instantaneously lost from the system .",
    "this occurs when the fraction of post - shock thermal energy is principally in the electrons ( @xmath64 ) and the electron energy is radiated away quickly .",
    "a common assumption regarding the fraction of post - shock energy going to the electrons is that @xmath65 is in the range @xmath66 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ significantly less than unity . in this case",
    "the outer proton shell initially slows approximately adiabatically regardless of the cooling time for the electrons .",
    "because a radiative evolution is not ruled out , and to bracket the range of possible behaviors , we will also note results for the radiative case where appropriate .",
    "the true behavior will be somewhere inbetween .",
    "we will see that the characteristic timescales of the burst from the neutron shell are not very sensitive to the choice of adiabatic or radiative evolution of the outer shell .",
    "the spectral characteristics of the burst from the neutron shell , on the other hand , are more sensitive to the conditions in the outer proton shell when the two shells collide .    for the case of a newtonian reverse shock ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "@xcite give the following analytic approximation to describe the slowing of the shell :    @xmath68    for radiative evolution the exponent @xmath69 above becomes @xmath70 .",

    "when the reverse shock is relativistic a collision between the neutron and proton shells could occur before @xmath73 .",
    "this requires @xmath74 , which is difficult to satisfy unless @xmath38 is very large and which also implies that the emission from the proton and neutron shells would not be well separated . in what follows",
    "we therefore concentrate on the case where @xmath75 .",
    "note that when @xmath76 , spreading is important for the neutron shell because @xmath77 .    with the above prescription for the evolution of the proton shell the two shells",

    "first , though , we note that @xcite have suggested that observable emission may result from the case where the neutrons decay after colliding with the proton shell .",
    "a quantitative assessment of this suggestion is not possible within the context of the standard picture of one body impinging and shocking on another . to see this",
    ", note that as the neutrons travel and decay they will decay on top of some ism rest mass . in a time @xmath86 as measured by an observer at rest in the central engine rest frame a fraction of energy @xmath87 appears in the form of protons from neutron decay . in this same time",
    "@xmath86 , the neutron shell will sweep over an ism rest mass of @xmath88 ( this is obtained by noting that the ism rest mass within @xmath89 is @xmath90 ) .",
    "a description of the ensuing process as a sweeping up a small amount of material and then a shocking is only possible if @xmath91 , or equivalently if @xmath92 because @xmath93 is the condition that neutrons havent decayed by @xmath30 , eq . [ w ] is in general not satisfied .",
    "this does not preclude substantial , observable emission from other processes , for example plasma instabilities .",
    "further study may provide interesting insights .",
    "when the conditions presented above are satisfied , neutrons in the inner shell decouple from the proton shell , carry an energy comparable to the energy in the proton shell , and decay by the time they collide with the outer proton shell .",
    "this collision occurs at approximately the time @xmath94 given above and will generate a forward and a reverse shock .",
    "the characteristics of these shocks and the resultant emission depend on the structure of the outer shell at the time of the collision .",
    "we will consider two limiting approximations to this structure .",
    "in the first approximation that we consider , the outer shell is assumed to have relaxed to a blandford - mckee self similar solution .",
    "also , the outer shell is assumed to be hot ( at least in the proton component ) , so that the enthalpy in the outer shell is much larger than the rest mass energy density .",
    "@xcite studied numerically the evolution of external shocks and showed that the blandford - mckee self similar solution is a good approximation once the shock has reached a radius greater than @xmath95 , with the exact number depending on whether or not the reverse shock is relativistic .",
    "therefore , for reasonable fireball parameters the collision between the inner and outer shells may occur while the outer shell is still relaxing to the self similar solution .",
    "a numerical solution of the evolution of the inner and outer shells would be needed to obtain the expected lightcurves in this case .",
    "the expected emission in this first aproximation has been worked out in detail by @xcite and we draw on their results . when the inner cold shell collides with the outer hot shell a weak forward shock results .",
    "the effect on the emission from the outer shell is a modest increase in the total luminosity and little change in the spectrum .",
    "the reverse shock propagating into the inner shell is strong and mildly relativistic .",
    "the characteristic frequency for the emission from the inner shell is    @xmath96    this expression should be taken as somewhat approximate because a numerical study of the evolution of the reverse shock propagating into the neutron shell is needed for an accurate determination of the characteristic frequency .",
    "the flux at the characteristic frequency is larger by a factor @xmath97 than the flux from the outer shell at the same frequency @xcite .",
    "if the observed emission from the proton shell arose from the reverse shock in the proton shell ( which might occur if the emission from the forward shock occurs at too high a frequency to be observed by batse ) , then the characteristic frequency in the first and second peaks is similar .",
    "if , on the other hand , the dominant emission in the first peak arose from the forward shock propagating into the ism , the first peak will have a much higher average energy than the second peak .",
    "the future glast mission may therefore provide useful insights into this problem .",
    "the spectrum of emission from the inner shell depends on whether or not the typical post - shock electron cools within a dynamical timescale .",
    "the thermal lorentz factor of an electron which just cools on a hydrodynamic timescale is given by @xmath98 . here",
    "@xmath99 is the magnetic field energy density in the inner neutron shell , @xmath100 is the thomson cross section , @xmath101 is the observed hydrodynamic timescale for the shell ( approximately @xmath102 ) , and @xmath71 is the observed time in seconds . because the thermal lorentz factor ( @xmath103 ) for the average electron in the post - shocked inner shell is typically of order a few hundred or higher , we see that @xmath104 during the first few seconds .",
    "this means that we may approximate the electrons as fast cooling . in this case",
    "the flux from the neutron shell is proportional to @xmath105 for frequencies above the characteristic frequency . here",
    "@xmath52 is the power law index characterizing the electron distribution in the shock ( typically @xmath106 ) . even though the characteristic frequency for the inner shell is low",
    ", significant emission can occur in the tens to hundreds of kev range if the index of the power law characterizing the post - shock electron distribution is close to 2 .",
    "the second approximation we consider is the case where essentially all of the shock energy generated in the outer shell goes into the electrons and is radiated away rapidly . in this case",
    "the two shells collide when they are cold and the collision will generate comparable forward and reverse shocks",
    ". the emission will be similar to that described in the first approximation discussed above .",
    "however , the characteristic frequency from these shocks can be a factor of tens to hundreds larger in this case because of the larger relative lorentz factor of the shells at the time of the collision and because of the smaller enthalpy of the outer shell at the time of collision .",
    "interestingly , the signature from a neutron decayed shell can be quite similar to what is expected for the case where , following internal shocks , a relativistic shell collides with the ism @xcite .",
    "for example , for grb 970228 one might interpret the first peak as arising from the forward shock occurring when a fast proton shell collides with the ism , and the second peak as arising from the collision of a neutron decayed shell with the outer shell .",
    "when the neutron shell leads to an observable peak , this second peak will have a characteristic duration @xmath107 and the second peak will be separated from the first peak by an observed time @xmath108    although the results for the cases where @xmath31 and where @xmath21 initially can be written in similar forms , there is an important difference between these two cases . in the newtonian reverse shock case",
    "( @xmath19 is driven to unity through spreading ) , @xmath109 and @xmath110 have a relatively strong dependence on @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , for the newtonian case , one could have @xmath111 , for example , leading to a second peak separated from the first by more than 100 first peak durations .",
    "however , for @xmath31 , @xmath112 and the dependence of @xmath109 and @xmath110 on @xmath63 is weak .",
    "in this section we illustrate how the observed temporal characteristics of short , simple grbs may be used to determine properties of the burster central engine .",
    "we emphasize again that we are supposing short bursts to arise from external shocks .",
    "we also assume that thermal pressure ( a fireball ) , and not for example magnetic fields , drives the acceleration of the baryons .",
    "both are debated assumptions .",
    "there are two types of short bursts amenable to our analysis .",
    "the first class is the set of bursts with single peaks of emission ; we show below how the absence of a second peak leads to interesting constraints . the second class is composed of bursts with two or more peaks .",
    "these bursts can be used to infer central engine properties by attributing a portion of the burst to a neutron decayed shell .",
    "this second method is attractive because in principle it places strong constraints on the central engine parameters and the electron fraction in the outflow .",
    "however , because many short bursts have structures too complicated to be explained within the context of the neutron decoupling scenario ( how does one get three peaks for example ) , this argument could only be convincing in a statistical sense .",
    "we first examine the constraints on central engine parameters implied by single peaked events . a basic confounding issue with this analysis is the uncertainty in the parameter @xmath19 , which describes the strength of reverse shock in the outer proton shell . if @xmath21 , then the absence of a second peak implies that one or both of eqs .",
    "[ tltgt],[neutrondecay ] were violated .",
    "the resultant constraints are illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "if @xmath31 , it is in general easy to satisfy the neutron decoupling condition .",
    "however , as the burst duration is not related to @xmath63 in this case , the absence of a second peak only gives weak constraints on the final lorentz factor @xmath113 of the fireball .    as a definite example , consider a neutron star merger model characterized by electron fraction @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and a duration of a few orbital periods ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "now , all bursts with durations greater than @xmath38 ( a few tens of msec ) arise from fireballs with @xmath21 . if the neutron decay condition ( eq . [ neutrondecay ] ) is satisfied , then one expects the presence of a second peak for all bursts with duration @xmath117 ( here we have taken @xmath118 as the criterion that the first and second peaks are distinguishable . ) for this range of burst durations it is readily seen that the neutron decay condition ( eq . [ neutrondecay ] ) is satisfied for @xmath119 when the evolution of the outer shell is approximately adiabatic .",
    "therefore , a second peak in the grb lightcurve for these events is expected .",
    "we now consider short bursts with multiple peaks .",
    "a difficulty here is that the majority of bursts display complex time structure with many peaks . for these bursts",
    "an inhomogeneous ism or some other mechanism must be invoked if they are to be explained by an external shock model .",
    "an analysis of implications of neutron decoupling for , _",
    "e.g. _ an inhomogeneous ism , would have to be done in order to look for correlations characteristic of neutron decoupling in these events . here for simplicity we will focus on that subclass of bursts that display only two peaks . of course , second peaks in these events may arise from the same mechanism that generates multiple peaks in more complicated bursts , and not from neutron decoupling .",
    "the general features of a two peaked burst due to neutron decoupling are given in eqs .",
    "[ tbn ] and [ deltat ] .",
    "a first proton shell peak is followed by a longer neutron shell peak , with an inter - peak duration somewhat shorter than the neutron peak duration .",
    "when @xmath21 initially and driven to unity through spreading , the ratio of first to second peak widths is a direct measure of @xmath63 . in turn",
    ", @xmath63 gives the relative energies of the two shells for a given @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , a large inferred @xmath63 and comparable energies in the two peaks implies a low @xmath44",
    ". a signature of low @xmath44 environments might be the presence of a population of bursts with @xmath120 .    for @xmath31",
    "it is difficult to make interesting inferences about central engine parameters from two peaked bursts .",
    "this is because i ) as noted above the neutron decoupling condition is in general satisfied for @xmath31 , ii ) the requirement that @xmath121 is non - negligible only leads to weak constraints on the final lorentz factor @xmath113 of the central engine , and iii ) the neutron decay condition is principally sensitive to @xmath38 which is directly measured for @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , the neutron decay condition depends on @xmath19 , which is not measured .",
    "lastly , the weakness of the dependence of @xmath122 on the fireball parameters means that a ratio of first to second peak widths of order unity is compatible with a broad range of conditions .    to make the connection between the work presented here and observations of grbs we display in figure 2 a plot of @xmath123 versus @xmath122 for a sample of bursts that display only two peaks in batse energy channel 2 . a proper analysis of these bursts would take into consideration the fact that a burst which displays only two peaks in a given energy channel may have more or fewer peaks in different energy channels .",
    "the fits we use were done by andrew lee @xcite .",
    "peaks are described by a function of the form @xmath124 . here",
    "@xmath125 is the observed intensity , @xmath126 is the time at which the peak attains its maximum , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the peak rise and decay times respectively , and @xmath129 characterizes the shape of the peak .",
    "we have followed @xcite in taking @xmath110 to be the difference between @xmath126 for the two peaks , and in approximating each peak width as @xmath130 .",
    "a number of the bursts in figure 2 are compatible with the neutron decoupling scenario presented here .",
    "if one attributes the cluster of bursts with @xmath131 as arising from neutron decoupling , then either @xmath67 and @xmath132 , or @xmath31 and @xmath63 can be quite large if the outflowing material is neutron rich .",
    "only the burst at @xmath133 might provide clear evidence for pronounced neutron decoupling and low @xmath44 .",
    "however , because @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath63 for a given set of central engine parameters , the absence of a population of bursts with large @xmath122 does not provide evidence against low @xmath44 central engines .",
    "a natural explanation for the absence of such bursts for low @xmath44 central engine models is that when @xmath63 is large , the reverse shock occurring when the outer proton shell collides with the ism is relativistic .",
    "perhaps the most natural place to look for evidence of neutron decoupling is in those bursts identified to have precursors .",
    "roughly , a precursor is a peak in the grb lightcurve preceding the main emission and separated from the main emission by a period where the flux is dominated by the background .",
    "@xcite studied in detail 24 bursts ( @xmath134 of their total sample ) that satisfied their definition of having a precursor .",
    "several of these 24 bursts are consistent with the neutron decoupling picture presented here and roughly half of them have @xmath135 .",

    "most of the bursts they examine have several times more emission in the second peak than in the first ( although there is a selection effect : they defined a precursor as an event having a smaller peak count rate than the main emission ) . within the context of the neutron decoupling picture these precursor events might be interpreted as evidence for a large neutron fraction .",
    "neutrons play an interesting role in relativistic fireballs : the fraction of neutrons in the initial fireball may be a direct indication of weak physics or other properties of the grb central engine @xcite , the strong interaction cross section is just right for neutrons to dynamically decouple during the acceleration phase of a fireballs evolution , and the free neutron lifetime allows for the possibility of neutrons decaying and shocking with the outer proton shell when neutron decoupling occurs .",
    "here we have explored in detail some implications of this last possibility .",
    "somewhat fortuitously , an observable photon signature of the neutron component is expected for a broad range of central engine parameters .",
    "this signature arises from the reverse shock propagating into the slower neutron decayed shell when it collides with the outer proton shell and is characterized by a second peak in the grb lightcurve .",
    "the characteristic frequency of this second peak is typically in the few kev or lower range .",
    "we have derived the relation between the properties of these two peaks and the central engine parameters .",
    "the spectral and temporal correlations characteristic of this second peak may be looked for in statistical studies of grb lightcurves . in principal",
    ", such studies could infer the electron fraction in the grb progenitor fireball .",
    "low electron fractions , which are thought to occur in neutron star - neutron star mergers , might evidence themselves in a population of two peaked bursts with an interpeak separation hundreds of times longer than the first peak duration .",
    "the population of bursts which contain precursors and which are characterized by stronger emission in the second peak than in the first may also be evidence for low electron fractions .",
    "lastly , the upcoming swift satellite offers a promising opportunity to search for evidence of neutron decoupling and infer central engine properties .",
