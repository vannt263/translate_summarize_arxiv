    "we will now first discuss the resulting phase diagrams of the bosonic superfluid to mott - insulator transition in the presence of a fermionic band - insulator , where the individual corrections to the standard hubbard model are discussed in detail below .",

    "the wannier functions of both species are almost identical .",
    "the interaction between the bosonic atoms is fixed to a repulsive scattering length of @xmath5 @xcite , while the attractive interaction between the two species is tunable over a wide range using a feshbach resonance @xcite .",

    "in particular , both atomic species can be bosonic or fermionic and the generalization to multi - component systems with more than two species is straight forward .    for a fermionic band insulator ,",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom are frozen out and the physics can be described by an effective bosonic model that takes into account all effects induced by the interaction with the fermions . in the framework of this paper",
    ", we will discuss in detail the derivation of an effective hamiltonian which reads @xmath6 we will see that despite its simplicity it already includes higher - band and bond - charge off - site processes . the latter gives rise to an occupation - dependent tunneling @xmath7 even within the lowest single - particle band .",

    "the effective single - band hamiltonian uses the ground state of the interacting system , called the dressed band , instead of the lowest single - particle band @xcite .",
    "the dressed operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 annihilate and create bosonic particles on site @xmath17 in this dressed band and @xmath18 counts the number of bosons on site @xmath17 .",
    "it is important to note that after the transformation to the dressed band , the phase diagrams can be calculated using standard single - band methods .",
    "the renormalized on - site energy @xmath14 is composed of the single particle energies of bosons @xmath19 and fermions @xmath20 as well as the interaction energies for the repulsion between the bosons @xmath21 and the attraction between the species @xmath22 .",

    "the mott - lobes are contracted compared with the standard hubbard model .",
    "this is a result of a decrease of the on - site energy and an increase of the total tunneling caused by off - site interactions @xcite . for increasing attraction between bosons and fermions the effect",
    "is reversed @xcite and the mott - lobes are extended exhibiting a critical transition point at much lower lattice depths .",
    "this effect can be attributed to a strong reduction of the total tunneling amplitude induced by off - site interactions .    in fig .",

    "is shifted to deeper lattices , where the shift is increased with the bosonic filling .",
    "this is mainly caused by the bosonic bond - charge interaction @xmath12 enhancing the total tunneling . with increasing attractive interaction @xmath28 the transition",
    "is strongly shifted to shallower lattice depths .",
    "depending on the filling , the shift of the mott - insulator transition caused by the fermionic atoms is @xmath30-@xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the predicted shift is considerably larger than calculated with the adiabatic band elimination method in ref .",
    "@xcite which also incorporates the bond - charge interactions",
    ". the effective potential approach in refs .",
    "@xcite does not include the important contributions of fermionic on - site energy and bosonic bond - charge interaction .",
    "the extended bose - fermi - hubbard model discussed here contains all relevant energies that can affect the superfluid to mott - insulator transition at zero temperature . as a result , the mott - insulator shift in ref .",
    "@xcite can be partly explained by interaction - induced effects .",
    "this provides a consistent picture , where the experimental observations @xcite are a combined effect of the hubbard extensions _ and _ the adiabatic heating processes @xcite which depend on the initial temperature of the quantum gas .",
    "we now turn back to the full description of the applied extended hubbard model which features two corrections to the standard hubbard model .",
    "first , off - site interactions lead to a significant contribution to the total tunneling amplitude by changing the effective tunneling potential .",
    "second , the inclusion of multi - band processes causes a modification of all model parameters .",
    "as mentioned above , mixtures of ultracold spin - polarized bosonic and fermionic atoms in optical lattices are usually described by the standard bose - fermi hubbard model .",
    "the underlying tight - binding approximation restricts the model to the lowest single - particle orbital and interactions between particles on the same lattice site .",
    "the resulting hubbard hamiltonian reads @xmath33 here , @xmath34",
    "( @xmath35 ) is the bosonic ( fermionic ) annihilation operator and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) the respective particle number operator . in general",
    ", the tunneling matrix elements for bosons ( @xmath8 ) and fermions ( @xmath38 ) can have different values .",
    "the on - site interaction is fully described by the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 for intra- and interspecies interaction , respectively .",
    "the total number of bosonic and fermionic atoms are fixed by the chemical potentials @xmath41 and @xmath42 . under common experimental conditions",
    "@xcite , the fermions are in a band - insulator phase where pauli - blocking prohibits tunneling .",
    "this freezes out the fermionic degrees of freedom and the resulting hamiltonian captures the behavior of the bosons under the influence of exactly one fermion per lattice site .",
    "consequently , we can set @xmath43 and get @xmath44 the interaction energy @xmath40 between bosons and fermions can be absorbed into an effective chemical potential @xmath45 and the resulting hamiltonian does not differ from the standard bose - hubbard model .",
    "thus , the behavior of the bosons is not influenced by the homogeneously distributed fermions , which is in contradiction to the experimental observations @xcite .    in the derivation of the standard hubbard model",
    ", it is argued that interaction processes between particles on neighboring lattice sites can be neglected due to their small amplitudes compared with on - site interactions .",
    "this argument is however only partly correct , since some of these processes , such as bond - charge interactions , involve the hopping of particles .",
    "compared to the conventional tunneling , these processes can be non - negligible and consequently alter the phase diagrams .",
    "in particular , the wannier functions in optical lattices differ strongly from their counterpart in solid state materials leading to comparably large matrix elements for bond - charge processes .",
    "in addition , the possibility of larger fillings in bosonic systems can enlarge these interaction effects .",
    "consequently , off - site interaction processes can be strongly enhanced for optical lattice systems .",

    "the interaction potential @xmath56 we applied describes the scattering properties using a finite - ranged box potential ( see @xcite ) . in a lowest - band treatment",
    ", this is usually replaced by contact interactions , i.e. , a @xmath57-pseudopotential . in a multi - orbital framework",
    "the latter would lead to mathematical subtleties @xcite .",
    "the distinct processes arising from the full two - body hamiltonian for bose - bose and the bose - fermi interaction are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : offsite - processes ] .",
    "in addition to the on - site interaction , the bose - bose interaction leads to the density - density interaction process @xmath58 , the correlated tunneling of a particle pair @xmath59 , and the bond - charge assisted tunneling @xmath60 . the respective matrix elements are @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "the amplitudes of these processes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : processintegrals ] as solid lines .",
    "while the density - density interaction @xmath64 and the pair tunneling amplitude @xmath65 are several orders of magnitudes smaller than the the standard hubbard processes , the bond - charge interaction @xmath9 is only one order of magnitude smaller than the conventional tunneling @xmath8 .",
    "as the bond - charge interaction @xmath60 scales with the particle number on both involved sites , it can easily reach non - negligible values and must be accounted for ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it scales linearly with the interaction strength which can be tuned experimentally .",
    "here , it is essential that the bond - charge interaction contributes to the tunneling of the particles rather than the on - site interaction .",
    "for the bose - fermi interaction two more processes exist as the interacting particles are distinguishable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : offsite - processes]b ) .",
    "first , the cross - tunneling , which is similar to the density - density interaction except that the particles interchange , and second , the bond - charge interaction , where either a bosonic or a fermionic particle tunnels .",
    "however , assuming a fermionic band insulator all processes involving the hopping of a fermion are forbidden .",
    "the respective amplitudes of the processes induced by bose - fermi interaction are plotted as dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : processintegrals ] .    in conclusion , only on - site interactions and bond - charge tunneling of bosons have to be taken into account ( shaded in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : offsite - processes]**k * * and * l * the tunneling in effective potentials is sketched .",
    "repulsive interactions , as between the bosons , effectively reduce the lattice depth , while attractive interactions have the opposite effect . depending on the relative scattering lengths ,",
    "the total tunneling can be strongly enhanced or reduced .",
    "this is consistent with the results for the fermionic tunneling obtained in @xcite .",
    "the modification of the total tunneling in the lowest band already leads to a considerable deformation of the well - known phase diagram of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition for bosons as discussed later in detail .",
    "whereas in the previous section we introduced off - site interactions as an important extension to the standard hubbard model , we will now discuss another important feature of the hamiltonian , namely the effective inclusion of higher bands . in the standard hubbard model approach , only the lowest single - particle band",
    "is assumed to be occupied .",
    "however , in the strongly correlated system particles are promoted to higher orbitals due to the interaction induced coupling between the bands . by changing their wave functions",

    "we have treated the problem by dressing @xcite the lowest single - particle band with interaction - induced occupations of higher - orbital states .",
    "this leads to a renormalization of interactions and tunneling parameters that become intrinsically occupation - dependent .",
    "these parameters have been used in order to define an extended bose - fermi - hubbard model capable of describing effects of higher orbitals and off - site interactions in bose - fermi mixtures .",
    "the results show in general that interactions in multi - component systems can have a crucial impact beyond the standard hubbard treatment . in the presented case ,",
    "the standard hubbard model is incapable of describing the interspecies interaction between bosonic and fermionic atoms correctly .",
    "while here mainly the effects on the bosonic atoms have been discussed , the mutual interaction affects the fermionic atoms similarly , which has recently been observed in experiment @xcite .",

    "<S> we show that off - site processes and multi - orbital physics have a crucial impact on the phase diagram of quantum gas mixtures in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we discuss bose - fermi mixtures where the intra- and interspecies interactions induce competing density - induced hopping processes , the so - called bond - charge interactions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , higher bands strongly influence tunneling and on - site interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a multi - orbital interaction - induced dressing of the lowest band which leads to renormalized hopping processes . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections give rise to an extended hubbard model with intrinsically occupation - dependent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting decrease of the tunneling competes with a decrease of the total on - site interaction energy both affecting the critical lattice depth of the superfluid to mott insulator transition . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the standard bose - fermi - hubbard model , we predict a large shift of the transition to shallower lattice depths with increasing bose - fermi attraction . </S>",
    "<S> the applied theoretical model allows an accurate prediction of the modified tunneling amplitudes and the critical lattice depth both recently observed experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum gas mixtures in optical lattices are well suited to study in detail interaction - induced effects in condensed matter . </S>",
    "<S> they allow for the investigation of systems with spin degree of freedom and with different species of particles that can even obey different quantum statistics . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the experimental realization of atomic mixtures of bosonic and fermionic particles ( e.g. , @xmath0rb-@xmath1k ) in optical lattices @xcite triggered a vivid discussion on the role of inter- and intraspecies interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments allow for the observation of the bosonic superfluid to mott - insulator transition in the presence of fermionic atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the prominent feature observed in all experiments is the decay of visibility and condensate fraction of the bosonic subsystem induced by the interaction with the fermionic atoms . </S>",
    "<S> two possible explanations for this drop in bosonic coherence were proposed . </S>",
    "<S> first , the process of adiabatic heating while ramping the lattice has been suggested @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is caused by different contributions of the atomic species to the total entropy and is therefore specific to the loading procedure of experiments with ultracold gases . </S>",
    "<S> second , an interaction - induced dressing of tunneling and interaction processes has been found that causes a shift of the superfluid to mott - insulator phase transition@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter effect corresponds to a necessary extension of the hubbard model at zero temperature and is therefore fundamental for various lattice systems . </S>",
    "<S> the important role of interaction - induced processes in optical lattices is caused by the specific shape of the wannier functions and the possibility of high filling factors .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ standard _ bose - fermi - hubbard model @xcite is restricted to the lowest single - particle band and on - site interactions . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it fails to describe interaction effects in boson - fermion mixtures . assuming a fermionic band - insulator , which is present in the experimental realizations @xcite , the boson - fermion interaction gives rise only to an irrelevant shift of the global chemical potential . even for realistic assumptions for the confining potential , </S>",
    "<S> the interspecies interaction has little influence @xcite . due to an effective screening </S>",
    "<S> even a small shift in the opposite direction is predicted . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the experimental results , the superfluid phase is therefore more stable within this framework , which poses the question of the applicability of the standard hubbard model in this case . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out that the bose - fermi - hubbard parameters , i.e. , tunneling and on - site interactions can be strongly influenced by the inclusion of higher orbitals and non - local interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> off - site interactions include the so - called bond - charge interactions that have a direct density - dependent influence on the total tunneling @xcite . for purely bosonic systems and without taking off - site interactions into account , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of higher bands has been discussed in , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both extensions can be included in extended hubbard models @xcite and can be illustrated as effective modifications of the tunneling potentials for both atomic species @xcite .    here , we present quantitative results for the phase diagram of bose - fermi mixtures using an extended hubbard model with multi - orbitally dressed processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it includes density - induced tunneling , so - called bond - charge interactions @xcite , as well as a multi - orbitally renormalized tunneling and interaction processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical effects discussed here are in general present for all interacting quantum gas mixtures . </S>",
    "<S> the exact results , however , depend on the quantum statistics of the particles and the specific parameters such as the detuning from the light potential and the atomic masses .    as a central result </S>",
    "<S> , we present the phase diagram of the superfluid to mott - insulator transition in a bose - fermi mixture in section [ sec : pd ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss the crucial effect of off - site interactions and the corresponding shortcomings of the standard bose - fermi hubbard model in section [ sec : off - site_interactions ] . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we present the procedure to incorporate higher - band processes in section [ sec : mo ] . afterwards , the corresponding extended hubbard models and the implications for the bosonic phase transition are discussed in detail in section [ sec : models ] . </S>"
