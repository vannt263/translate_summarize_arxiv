    "richard feynman motivated the idea of using analog quantum simulation as a means to describe the behavior of complex quantum - mechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "this idea has been experimentally realized for the transverse - field ising model in cold ion traps in one - dimension  @xcite , in neutral atoms driven to a nonequilibrium state  @xcite , and with preliminary results also available for cold ion traps in two - dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the tunability and control of cold atom and cold ion systems are unmatched in traditional ( real - material ) condensed matter systems and therefore they are an ideal platform for examining idealized condensed matter systems and searching for nontrivial quantum ground states . in addition , the isolation of the system from the environment with long decoherence times ( in milliseconds ) also offers tremendous opportunities for the study of non - equilibrium coherent many - body dynamics in real time such as thermalization  @xcite and quench dynamics  @xcite in cold atoms .",
    "cold ions in traps have been proposed theoretically as potential emulators for effective spin models  @xcite . for the case of linear ion chains in paul traps ,",
    "the experimental protocol has been well established  @xcite .",
    "however , there are still difficulties in scaling up paul - trap based systems to more than approximately sixteen ions while maintaining good quantum control , although next generation traps are planned for up to potentially 100 ions .",
    "theoretically , phonon modes in linear paul traps have been well understood for a decade  @xcite and are essential for the realization of the spin models in the system ( although effects of micromotion on two - dimensional crystals in paul traps are more complicated  @xcite ) . on the other hand , ion crystals in penning traps",
    "can be easily stabilized with several hundreds of ions in a two dimensional structure and can potentially simulate quantum phases beyond what modern computers can simulate . recently , a feasibility study has shown that it is possible to generate spin - spin interactions in these systems that decay like a tunable power law for long distances  @xcite .",
    "similar to cold ions in linear paul traps , a theoretical understanding of phonon modes is needed as a prerequisite for the adiabatic state evolution of these systems .    in this paper",
    ", we provide a complete theory for the oscillatory normal modes in a penning trap , tuned to parameters similar to those used in current experiments .",
    "we then quantize these phonons and show how they can be used with a spin - dependent optical dipole force to generate effective spin - spin interactions .",
    "recently , others have shown how to find equilibrium positions for similar trapping potentials  @xcite , and have evaluated the phonon spectra using different methods from the ones we employ  @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the theory for the normal modes of cold ions in penning traps .",
    "we determine the ground state of the crystal configuration by finding the static equilibrium of the system in the rotating frame of a rotating crystal .",
    "the normal modes are then found by harmonic expansion around the equilibrium state . because the penning trap creates a rotating crystal , the normal modes must be solved in the rotating frame , and the longitudinal ( planar ) modes require the solution of a quadratic eigenvalue problem because they have velocity - dependent forces .",
    "the phonon hamiltonian is then derived by quantizing the normal modes . in sec .",
    "ii , we also discuss quantum simulation based on spin - dependent forces arising from laser - ion dipole interactions .",
    "the effective ising models mediated by the axial phonon modes and the planar phonon modes are also described . in sec .",
    "iii , we show the numerical results for phonon frequencies and for spin - spin interactions for parameters relevant for current experiments . in sec .",
    "iv , we provide our conclusions .     that pushes the atoms towards @xmath0 and the cylindrical electrodes [ with the radial quadratic potential @xmath1 , which tends to push the ions out radially ] .",
    "in addition , the repulsive coulomb potential between the ions tends to destabilize the system in the trap .",
    "a static magnetic field @xmath2(@xmath3 ) is thus applied along the axial direction to provide the radial confinement of the ions . to lock the rotational angular frequency of the ions at a specific rotational speed , a time - dependent clockwise quadrupole potential @xmath4 ( @xmath5 )",
    "is applied to the ions through ring electrodes so that the steady state of the ions ( with a rigid body rotational speed @xmath6 ) can be phase locked .",
    "note that the rotating quadrupole potential is well implemented by ring electrodes with just six sectors ( as employed in the nist penning traps  @xcite).,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "we consider hundreds of spins , realized via the two hyperfine states @xmath7 , @xmath8 of @xmath9 ions , localized in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the setup of cold ions in penning traps is briefly illustrated in fig .  1",
    ". further details can be found in the published literature  @xcite . in current experiments",
    ", there also is a small amount of impurities such as @xmath10 which forms via collision of the beryllium ions with hydrogen molecules that are in the background gas .",
    "hence a real system will have different mass particles ( which will tend to separate from one another as the centrifugal force pushes the heavier particles to the outer regions of the crystal ) . in this paper , we discuss the clean limit only , and ignore such defects .",
    "the effect of defects will be studied elsewhere .    given the above considerations , we form the ion lagrangian in the laboratory frame of reference as @xmath11,\\ ] ] in which @xmath12 is the total number of ions , @xmath13 is the positive unit charge of and @xmath14 is the mass of a @xmath9 ion , @xmath15 is the ion spatial configuration in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath16 is the total scalar potential acting on the @xmath17th ion and @xmath18 is the vector potential in the symmetric gauge for the axial magnetic field @xmath19 .",

    "the ion potential @xmath16 is time dependent in the laboratory frame of reference .",
    "however , in the co - rotating frame with the angular speed @xmath6 , the corresponding effective potential becomes time independent and the problem can be understood as an equilibrium problem  @xcite .",
    "the geometric configuration of the ions under rotation in the steady state is simplified by finding the ( static ) equilibrium ion configuration in the rotating frame . in general ,",
    "the coordinate transformation between the rotating frame and the laboratory frame is described by the @xmath30 rotational operator @xmath31 with the angle of rotation @xmath32 : @xmath33 where the superscript @xmath34 denotes the rotating frame of reference .",
    "the operator @xmath31 satisfies @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "accordingly , in the rotating frame , the rotating wall potential @xmath37 does not depend on time and is given by @xmath38 by direct substitution . as a consequence , the effective potential energy in the rotating frame",
    "is then given by the expression    @xmath39    which now includes the potential terms from the centrifugal and lorentz forces as well .",
    "ions trapped in a penning trap do not always crystallize into a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the following approximate confinement criterion has to be satisfied to guarantee it is energetically favorable for ions to stay in the plane with @xmath40 : @xmath41 in addition , when the rotating wall potential vanishes ( @xmath42 ) , the system is confined in the plane only if the radial potential is attractive . in this case , the confinement criterion for zero rotating wall potential is given by @xmath43 for nonzero rotating wall potentials , the ion saddle potential caused by the rotating wall potential @xmath23 breaks rotational symmetry and leads to a confinement of ions only when the coefficients of the trapping potential along the weak trapping axis is positive . in other words , the following criterion has to be satisfied to have a confined equilibrium state for all ions : @xmath44 the above heuristic criteria narrow down the relevant parameter regime in which a stable planar ion crystal formation is feasible for quantum simulation .",
    "of course , the accurate quantitative prediction of the stability of the ion crystals must also include the coulomb interaction between the ions .",
    "the precise criterion can only be found by solving for the equilibrium positions and showing that all normal modes have real frequencies , so that the equilibrium is globally stable  @xcite .",
    "based on the invariance of the lagrangian , we derive the lagrangian in the rotating coordinates from eq .",

    "the modification of the magnetic field is due to the coriolis force for the moving ions in the rotating frame .",
    "there is no coriolis force present for ions when the ions are in equilibrium in the rotating frame but the coriolis force can have effects on the oscillating normal mode motion away from equilibrium .",
    "the centrifugal force originates from the term @xmath49 in the effective potential energy @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi_r ] ) .",
    "it has been well established experimentally that ions in penning traps reach different static equilibrium states in the rotating frame of reference ( steady state in the laboratory frame of reference ) for different values of the adjustable rotating angular frequency given by a rotating wall potential @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can find the stable spatial configuration of the ions by determining the local minima of the effective potential energy in the rotating frame of reference .",
    "in general , such a minimization problem is difficult to solve for the absolute minimum in two or higher dimensions , because many different configurations can be competitive for the lowest energy state and there can be large potential barriers between them . to find an experimentally viable solution , we are guided by the experiments themselves , which typically observe the ions arranged in an approximate triangular lattice in a single plane .",
    "our strategy is to construct the trial configurations based on a `` closed shell '' construction analogous to finding stable electronic configurations in an atom as detailed in the numerical discussions . even though we can not guarantee that the stable configuration we find is the global minimum , the nist experimental systems seem to find the same local minimum which validates our approach . in further support of the strategy ,",
    "we have successfully predicted the phonon mode spectra and spin - spin interaction observed in the nist experiments  @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss the collective phonon excitations about the previously determined equilibrium configuration .",
    "based on the equilibrium configuration , normal mode dynamics of ions near the equilibrium structure can be fully captured by the full system lagrangian @xmath52 expanded around this minimal ion spatial configuration to quadratic orders by a taylor series .",
    "we use the following notation for the ion coordinates @xmath53 and for the ion velocities @xmath54 in the rotating frame .",
    "since the equilibrium configuration is the local minimum of the classical action of the system @xmath55 , the first order terms in @xmath56 and @xmath57 do not contribute to the expansion by construction .",
    "therefore , the system lagrangian can be expanded to quadratic order as    @xmath58 l{\\big{|}}_{0}\\ ] ]    where the first term @xmath59 is the lagrangian from the equilibrium state and the second term is the lagrangian @xmath60 due to fluctuations away from the equilibrium state .",
    "one can isolate the planar motions of the ions in the @xmath61 plane from the axial motions along the @xmath62 axis based on the consideration that the lorentz force due to the external magnetic fields acts only in the crystal plane and the potentials are separable in cylindrical coordinates , hence there is no harmonic coupling between planar and axial degrees of freedom ( anharmonic effects can couple normal modes together but are ignored here ) .",
    "therefore , we can study the axial and planar modes independently .    the lagrangian which governs the axial motions of the ions",
    "is described as @xmath63 in which the symmetric stiffness matrix @xmath64 is a real hermitian matrix @xmath65 and the matrix elements @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the distance between two ions in equilibrium ( in the rotating frame ) .",
