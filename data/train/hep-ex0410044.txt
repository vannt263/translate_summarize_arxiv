    "the decay of the @xmath6 into a vector and pseudoscalar meson pair , @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 representing vector and pseudoscalar mesons , can proceed via strong and electromagnetic reactions .",
    "a well measured set of all possible decays of @xmath7 allows one to systematically study the quark gluon contents of pseudoscalar mesons , su(3 ) breaking , as well as determine the electromagnetic and doubly suppressed ozi amplitudes in two - body @xmath6 decays  @xcite .",
    "markiii  @xcite and dm2  @xcite measured many @xmath7 decays and obtained the @xmath10 mixing angle , the quark content of the @xmath3 and @xmath11 , and much more .",
    "recently , a sample of @xmath0 events was accumulated with the upgraded beijing spectrometer ( besii )  @xcite , which offers a unique opportunity to measure precisely the full set of @xmath7 decays . in an earlier analysis based on this data set , the branching fraction of @xmath12 was measured to be @xmath13  @xcite , which is higher than the pdg  @xcite value by about 30% .",
    "this indicates a higher branching fraction for @xmath14 than those from older experiments  @xcite , since the dominant dynamics in @xmath15 is @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , remeasuring the branching fractions of all @xmath16 decay modes becomes very important . in this paper , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19",
    "are studied , based on the besii @xmath0 events .",
    "the upgraded beijing spectrometer detector ( besii ) is located at the beijing electron - positron collider ( bepc ) .",
    "besii is a large solid - angle magnetic spectrometer which is described in detail in ref .",
    "the momentum of charged particles is determined by a 40-layer cylindrical main drift chamber ( mdc ) which has a momentum resolution of @xmath20/p=@xmath21 ( @xmath22 in gev / c ) .",
    "particle identification is accomplished using specific ionization ( @xmath23 ) measurements in the drift chamber and time - of - flight ( tof ) information in a barrel - like array of 48 scintillation counters .",
    "the @xmath23 resolution is @xmath24 ; the tof resolution for bhabha events is @xmath25 ps . radially outside of the time - of - flight counters is a 12-radiation - length barrel shower counter ( bsc ) comprised of gas proportional tubes interleaved with lead sheets .",

    "the iron flux return of the magnet is instrumented with three double layers of proportional counters ( muc ) that are used to identify muons .    a geant3 based monte carlo package ( simbes ) with detailed consideration of the detector performance",
    "the consistency between data and monte carlo has been carefully checked in many high purity physics channels , and the agreement is reasonable .",
    "the detection efficiency and mass resolution for each decay mode are obtained from a monte carlo simulation which takes into account the angular distributions appropriate for the different final states  @xcite .",
    "in this analysis , the @xmath30 meson is observed in its @xmath31 decay mode , and the pseudoscalar mesons are detected in the modes : @xmath32 ; @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ; and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",

    "2 .   events should have at least the minimum number of isolated photons associated with the different final states .",
    "isolated photons are those that have energy deposited in the bsc greater than 60 mev , the angle between the direction at the first hit layer of the bsc and the developing direction of the cluster less than 30@xmath47 , and the angle between photons and any charged tracks larger than 10@xmath47 .",
    "each charged track in an event , @xmath48 is determined using both @xmath23 and tof information : + @xmath48=@xmath49+@xmath50 + a charged track is identified as a @xmath51 or @xmath52 if its @xmath53 is less than those for any other assignment . to reject background events , two charged tracks are required to be identified as kaons in @xmath54 . for the other channels ,",
