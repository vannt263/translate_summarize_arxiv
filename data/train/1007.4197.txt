    "since all orbit determinations to date have been dominated by the nine epochs of astrometry from keck kcam and scam , the semimajor axis discrepancy implies that the pixel scale of one or both of these instruments was underestimated by @xmath75% , resulting in systematically low semimajor axes .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the previously published nirc2 astrometry from @xcite and @xcite is in good agreement with our best - fit orbit .",
    "also , the _ hst_/stis measurement would be highly inconsistent with a value for the semimajor axis as low as previously found , showing that our semimajor axis is not simply due to a problem with the nirc2 calibration . since we find the same orbital period as in previous work but a semimajor axis that is 5.4% larger , our dynamical total mass is significantly higher than previously found .",
    "this would be a 16% effect , but it is moderated somewhat by the revised _",

    ", the broadband colors of models consistently disagree with observations of objects of known mass over a broad range of spectral types .",
    "we also note that a significant disadvantage of the @xcite approach is that evolutionary models occupy a very thin strip in this parameter space as opposed to @xmath190 .",
    "this resulted in many of our randomly drawn ( , ) measurements falling outside the range predicted by models ( from 1.2% to 99.8% in the worst case ) , and we simply excluded these points from the analysis .",
    "@xcite interpreted their observed discrepancies with theory as an error in the evolutionary model cooling curves , i.e. , a mass problem . using their method",
    ", we find an opposite mass discrepancy because our  estimates are @xmath7650  k higher than theirs , resulting in higher masses .",
    "we suggest that the strong sensitivity of this model - testing method to the input  estimates means that any observed discrepancies more readily identify problems in the way  is determined from atmospheric models ( i.e. , a temperature problem ) , rather than a problem with evolutionary models .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that  has turned out to be a pair of young ( @xmath9140  myr ) brown dwarfs given the lack of detectable lithium @xcite and its m@xmath80 spectral classification @xcite . with a total mass of @xmath191  , one or both of the components may even lie below the theoretically predicted lithium depletion boundary at @xmath70.0550.065  .",
    "in fact , even objects massive enough to deplete lithium take time to achieve the internal temperature necessary to do so ( @xmath192  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite show that a 0.070  object takes 220  myr to destroy 99% of its initial lithium , while at 145  myr only @xmath193  stars are similarly depleted . using the lyon and tucson models ,",
    "we find predicted lithium fractions of @xmath194 and @xmath195 for , respectively , and @xmath196 and @xmath197 for .",
    "thus , both sets of models predict that the primary may be depleted in lithium , but that the secondary should retain nearly all of its initial lithium .",
    "the presence of lithium in the fainter secondary may be masked by the primary flux in the integrated - light spectroscopy of the system , so resolved spectroscopy to detect the doublet at 6708    is needed to test this prediction of brown dwarf evolutionary models directly .",

    "taken together , the lyon and tucson models predict an age of @xmath1  myr .",
    "this is consistent with the age of 125  myr derived for the pleiades by @xcite using the lithium depletion boundary .",
    "thus , we might expect  to obey roughly the same boundaries in spectral type and color as found by @xcite .",
    "the lithium boundary in the pleiades lies between spectral types of m6.5 and m7 , with objects @xmath198 having detectable lithium .",

    "@xcite used spectroscopically derived @xmath199 colors to define the lithium depletion boundary in the pleiades , with all objects bluer than 2.20  mag being depleted in lithium . from the integrated - light optical spectrum of @xcite , we derived @xmath200  mag using the same method as @xcite . to be @xmath70.10  mag .",

    "the age derived in our analysis is based solely on the model - predicted evolution , and for its actual age to be older either : ( 1 ) the measured parallax would have to be smaller ( i.e. ,  more distant ) ; or ( 2 ) the models would need to under - predict the luminosities of . in the former case , a parallax that is 3.5@xmath35 smaller ( placing the binary at @xmath201  pc ) would increase the total mass to 0.152  , resulting in a model - derived age @xmath202  myr and individual components predicted to be nearly fully depleted in lithium . in the latter case , the luminosities we measure would indeed be high for their mass , not because the objects are very young but rather because model  evolution is not correct .",
    "such an error has previously been suggested by @xcite to explain the higher - than - predicted luminosities of the benchmark brown dwarf binary hd  130948bc ( l4+l4 ) .",

    "the b component would have to actually comprise two fainter brown dwarfs whose combined luminosity is below that of the single a component .",
    "that can be ruled out is that the secondary component of  is more luminous than the primary .",

    ", it would be even less likely that the most massive component ( whatever its mass ) would have had time to reach the core temperature needed to destroy its initial lithium .",
    "thus , we conclude that given all available constraints  can not be a higher order multiple .",

    "_ and _ lack of detectable lithium absorption , this binary has turned out to be pair of brown dwarfs . to match the observed total mass and component luminosities ,",

    "if the model - derived age for  is correct , it is nearly the same age as the pleiades ; however , it appears to be discrepant with the boundary between lithium - depleted and lithium - bearing objects from @xcite .",
    "if the parallax measured by @xcite is accurate , this disagreement with the pleiades indicates a possible problem with the model - derived age , which in our analysis is based solely on the predicted evolution .",

    "all four model atmosphere grids we tested give effective temperatures @xmath7250  k warmer than predicted for our objects of known mass from lyon dusty evolutionary model radii ( including the ames - dusty model atmospheres which were used as the boundary condition for the dusty evolutionary models ) .",
    "although model atmospheres now incorporate considerably more advanced theory than the decade - old evolutionary models , we propose that such a large offset can not be entirely explained by problems with model radii . instead ,",
    "model atmospheres are likely to be the major source of this discrepancy given that : ( 1 )  they must harbor systematic errors at some level , since they do not completely match our observed spectra ; and ( 2 )  roughly the same  offset is observed over a narrow range of  but a wide range of masses , ages , and activity levels",
    ". such a discrepancy would be difficult to explain in the context of evolutionary models , although they may also harbor systematic errors that partially contribute to this inconsistency .",
    "directly measured radii are needed to determine which set of models correctly predicts  ( if either do ) .",
    "this can be readily tested with future discoveries of late - m eclipsing binaries , as a 250  k offset corresponds to a substantial radius difference ( 1520% ) .",
    "in addition to our standard line of analysis , we have also explored the approach to testing models used by @xcite for the late - m binaries common to our two samples .",
    "our model atmosphere fitting of integrated - light spectra yields higher  estimates than their approach of fitting resolved broadband photometry .",
    "consequently , we find evolutionary model - derived masses from their approach that are a factor of @xmath92 to 4 higher than theirs , resulting in an opposite discrepancy with measured dynamical masses .",
    "this illustrates that their method sensitively relies upon the input , a property that can not be determined directly without radius measurements .",
    "thus , this approach may have limited utility in testing evolutionary models , as observed discrepancies are more readily caused by problems with estimates from model atmospheres . to summarize how our conclusions contrast with those of @xcite : ( 1 )  they found estimates for  from model atmospheres that are @xmath7400  k _ lower _ than our evolutionary model - derived values , whereas we find estimates that are @xmath7250  k _",
    "higher_. ( 2 )  they interpreted these results in terms of mass , concluding that systematic errors in the evolutionary model cooling curves were responsible for observed discrepancies .",
    "we propose instead that the discrepancy is largely caused by systematic errors in the model atmospheres .",
    "as the sample of ultracool dwarfs with dynamical mass measurements grows , we are beginning to probe the diversity of the field population , which comprises both very low - mass stars and brown dwarfs . at the cool temperatures of late - m dwarfs",
    ", field objects can span nearly a factor a two in mass depending on their age , which makes mass measurements crucial for breaking this degeneracy . at cooler temperatures",
    "there are even fewer mass measurements presently available , and the effects of complex processes such as atmospheric dust formation become more important .",
