    "since the discovery of the antiferromagnetic coupling between fe layers @xcite and giant magnetoresistance @xcite in fe / cr multilayers a lot of studies have paid a great attention to the cr magnetic properties in these systems . up to now , however , the discussion on the magnetic order in thin cr films continues , there is no clarity in understanding of the interconnection between the cr magnetic state and the magnetic coupling of fe layers .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite succeeded in obtaining the fe / cr multilayer systems with a sn monolayer inserted .",
    "multilayer systems @xmath2 with different widths @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 were investigated by various physical methods including the mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "one of the most important results was the established dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field ( hff ) at sn nuclei on the width of the cr layer .",
    "this dependence is characterized by a sharp drop of the hff magnitude at a cr width less than 3 nm ( @xmath6 nm ) @xcite .",
    "mssbauer experiments can not give a direct answer as to the magnetization of cr atoms , but if the hff at sn is assumed to be proportional to the local magnetic moments of the nearest cr atoms , one should inevitably conclude that at a width of the cr layer less than 3 nm the cr magnetic moments in these systems are close to zero .    as soon as the experimental data had been available , theoretical first - principles calculations of the electron structure and magnetic characteristics of fe / cr / sn / cr were conducted @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed by both linear methods @xcite and the green function formalism @xcite with different approximations of the exchange - correlation potential . as a whole , the results obtained by different methods and authors agree well with each other and do confirm the possibility of estimation of the cr magnetization from mssbauer experiments at sn @xcite .",
    "some differences between the results have , though , led to difficulties in explanation of the peculiarities of the hff variation and elicited a number of unsolved questions .",
    "in the paper presented , we concentrated our attention on the discussion of two hypotheses advanced earlier in @xcite for explanation of the sn hff behavior . the first one is connected with the existence of the high - spin and low - spin states and a transition between them with a change in the cr width .",
    "such solutions were obtained for the @xmath0 system in @xcite .",
    "the second hypothesis is connected with the effect of the fe / cr boundary roughness on the cr magnetization .",
    "we have performed additional calculations of the periodical systems @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the latter being calculated with and without account of the roughness of the fe / cr interface ) . the calculations were conducted by the following methods : the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave method ( fp lapw ) realized in the program package wien2k @xcite , and a screened korringa - kohn - rostoker method developed in jlich @xcite in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa skkr ) and in a full - potential scheme ( fp skkr ) .",
    "the calculations employ the exchange - correlation potential in the local density approximation ( lda ) in the formalism of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , if scaled to the moment , the lda and the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) yield the same behavior .    for our calculations",
    "we have used the following models .",
    "the multilayer systems were presented as alternating layers in the ( 001 ) plane of a bcc lattice with two types of roughness ( fig .",
    "[ roughness ] , a and b ) and without it .",
    "[ roughness ]    the interlayer distances fe - fe , fe - cr , cr - cr and cr - sn were taken equal to 0.144 nm , which corresponds to the half lattice parameter of the bulk cr ( 0.288 nm ) .",
    "notice that the lattice relaxation and small variations of the interlayer distances do not change the qualitative behavior of the results of ref .",
    "as stated earlier , the calculation of the @xmath0 system by the skkr method gave two solutions @xcite that we called `` high - spin '' ( hs ) and `` low - spin '' ( ls ) in accordance with the magnetic moment magnitudes ( the difference in energy between the two solutions did not exceed 1 mry per unit cell ) . in connection with these solutions",
    "it is appropriate to raise here some questions .",
    "first : why the ls solution was not found in ref",
    ".  @xcite by the lapw method ?",
    "second : do there exist two solutions in other systems and do they give a possibility to describe the peculiarities of the sn hff behavior as a transition from the hs to the ls state with a decrease of the cr width ? and the third question concerns the nature of the ls state ( the character and peculiarities of the behavior of the cr magnetic moments in the hs solution were considered in detail and explained in @xcite ) .",
    "two solutions were also found in an isolated 23-layer cr film by other authors @xcite .",
    "one of them was classified as a spin density wave and was connected with incommensurate spin density wave ( isdw ) of bulk cr .",
    "the isdw has been studied from sixties , and now reliable experimental and theoretical results are available for both bulk cr , and some multilayer films with cr , the majority of which are reflected in reviews @xcite in a rather full measure .",
    "we did not meet in literature with isdw in cr films thinner than 20 - 22 layers .",
    "this seems natural as the isdw half period exceeds 20 layers .",
    "a hypothesis has , nevertheless , arisen that the nature of the low - spin state obtained in @xcite is connected with isdw .",
    "for the existence of the isdw solution , the fermi - surface topology and the accuracy of its description are important . assuming that in the fp lapw calculation of the work @xcite the accuracy of the fermi - surface description was unsufficient , we have increased the number of basis wave functions limiting it by the parameter @xmath7 ( in @xcite it was @xmath8 ) .",
    "the expansion of the wave functions over the angular momentum was done up to @xmath9 , and the fourier expansion of the electron charge density was conducted up to @xmath10 .",
    "we should note that in the modification of the method used here , namely , the augmented plane wave plus local orbitals ( apw+l.o . ) , the number of plane waves is usually limited by @xmath11 , as the convergence is achieved at lower number of basis functions than in the common realization of the lapw method @xcite .",
    "we have increased also the number of k - points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone up to 42 , which may be crucial for the description of the fermi surface topology .",
    "the calculation was conducted in a scalar - relativistic approximation for the valence electrons and it was fully relativistic for the core electrons with an energy boundary at -7 ry separating these two groups .",
    "the results of calculation of the @xmath0 system are given in table  [ table1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    .",
    "the magnetic moments ( @xmath12 ) in @xmath0 .",
    "[ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one may see from table  [ table2 ] that the roughness in both model cases leads to a decrease in magnetic moments of the cr atoms nearest to the sn layer .",
    "tis results in a significant decrease in hff at sn from 16.1 t ( for the system with ideal interfaces ) to 4.7 - 5.0 t ( for the systems with roughness ) .",
    "this does not explain in full measure the experimental sharp drop of the hff . to obtain it",
    ", one should perform the calculation of the systems with higher width and different roughnesses .",
    "the first - principles fp lapw calculation of the multilayer model system @xmath0 gives two solutions .",
    "one of them , with a lower magnitude of the cr magnetic moments and a phase slip , was identified as an isdw .",
    "this identification was confirmed by the skkr calculations .",
    "a characteristic feature of the isdw state in our case is the fact that the sn layer promotes the realization of the isdw state in the films with cr width less than the half period of isdw .    in connection with the above statements",
    ", one may assert that the band calculations of the periodical multilayer systems without the interface roughness can not explain the experimentally observed sharp drop of the hff at sn with a decrease of the cr layer width .",
    "the presence of roughness in the fe / cr interfaces leads to an hff drop in thin films .",
    "this is confirmed by the first - principles fp lapw calculations conducted for the model @xmath1 with ideal fe / cr interfaces and with two types of roughness .",
    "the calculations showed that there is a threefold drop in hff in the systems with roughness as compared to the system with ideal fe / cr boundaries .",
    "however for explanation of the experimental dependence it is necessary to calculate a number of systems with more than 20 - 23 cr layers and with allowance for the different roughness .",
    "one of us ( d.v.f . ) would like to thank dr .",
    "nikos papanikolaou and professor ingrid mertig for providing a version of the screened kkr code and valuable advice .",
