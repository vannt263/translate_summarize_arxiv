    "atomic line opacities play a crucial role in stellar astrophysics .",
    "first , they strongly modify the radiative transfer in stars , and therefore impact their physical structure .",
    "secondly , the detailed comparison between model and observed spectra is a powerful diagnostic tool that may be used to study stars and stellar populations .",
    "everything we know about the chemical abundances on stars , planets , galaxies , interstellar , intergalactic and intracluster medium is , ultimately , dependent on the quantum mechanic parameters which characterize atomic ( and molecular ) electronic ( vibrational and rotational ) transitions .",
    "these parameters will , given the thermodynamic conditions in which the transition happens , define the profile of the spectral line .",
    "for the case of atomic transitions , these parameters are : the central wavelength of the line , the energy levels of the transition , the oscillator strength ( which dominates the line depth ) and the broadening parameters ( which dominate the wings of the lines ) .",
    "with such a wide impact on astronomy , one would expect by now to have access to a complete , accurate and precise list of atomic transitions .",
    "this , unfortunately , is not the case . although nowadays there exist fairly comprehensive databases ( e.g. , the nist atomic spectra database   and the vienna atomic line database  ) of the atomic transition probabilities necessary for stellar abundance studies , they are far from being complete .    in general ,",
    "one half the discernible lines in observed stellar spectra are missing from the line lists with good wavelengths @xcite . to have an accurate opacity list for atoms and ions , we need all levels , including hyperfine and isotopic splittings . lifetimes and damping constants depend on sums over the levels .",
    "inside stars there are thermal and density cutoffs that limit the number of levels , but in circumstellar , interstellar , and intergalactic space , photoionization and recombination can populate high levels , even for high ions .",
    "we need all stages of ionization for elements at least up through zn . in the sun",
    "there are unidentified asymmetric triangular features that are unresolved multiplets of light elements @xcite .",
    "all the magnetic dipole , electric quadrupole , and maybe higher - pole , forbidden lines are required as well .",
    "however , except for the simplest species , it is impossible to generate accurate energy levels or wavelengths theoretically . in principle , they must be measured in the laboratory .    because the parameters of relatively few lines were actually measured in laboratory , to compute a theoretical stellar spectra with good spectrophotometry is necessary to include the so - called `` predicted lines '' : lines where either one or both energy levels of the transition were predicted from quantum mechanics calculations @xcite .",
    "usually only the lower energy levels of atoms have been determined in the laboratory , particularly for complex spectra such as those from iron .",
    "if only those transitions were taken into account , the atmospheric line blanketing computed from such data would be severely incomplete .",
    "the predicted lines are essential for computing accurately the structure of model atmospheres and for spectrophotometric predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but as the quantum mechanics predictions are accurate to only a few per cent , wavelengths for these lines may be largely uncertain .",
    "also the line oscillator strengths are sufficiently accurate merely in a statistical sense .",
    "the predicted lines are , therefore , unsuitable for high resolution analyses @xcite .",
    "efforts are underway to reduce transition probability uncertainties of selected lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and accurately compute broadening parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , for the purpose of high spectral resolution chemical analysis of stellar photospheres , several limitations of the atomic line lists are being successfully tackled by different authors and methods ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has also been shown in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that even empirical calibrations of some specific lines can produce significant improvement on the synthetic spectra generated .",
    "the empirical calibration is done by changing the values of the parameters on the line list , generating models and comparing them with observations of very well known stars ( like the sun or arcturus , for example ) .",
    "this process is repeated until the results are adequate @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these approaches tend to improve the quality of a selective group lines , mostly those that were considered more suitable to chemical abundance measurements , where relatively weak lines in the linear part of the curve of growth are favored . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong lines close to saturation and blended features are the ones which dominate spectral indices in integrated spectra of stellar populations .",
    "while these efforts are improving the parameters for thousands of lines , tens of millions of lines are estimated to be needed to compute , say , a complete stellar grid with a good range of atmospheric parameters .",
    "therefore , an innumerous amount of lines remain poorly characterized . for the ultimate goal of computing a large grid of theoretical stellar spectra for further use in automatic classification of stellar spectroscopic surveys and stellar population modeling , this is rather limiting .    aiming to overcome these limitations and to create a more robust and automatic method for the calibration of atomic parameters , we introduce a powerful statistical technique recently developed to deal with multi - extremal problems involving optimization : the cross - entropy algorithm ( hereafter , ce ) .    in this work",
    "we validate our ce method to calibrate atomic line lists using synthetic spectra which simulates very well known stars .",
    "the code is hereafter called alicce : atomic lines calibration using the cross - entropy algorithm .",
    "we show the great capability of the method to determine the atomic parameters of the absorption lines by comparing the models with the simulated spectra .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in  2 we explain the cross - entropy method , in  3 we explain the methodology used in the validation process , in  4 we show our results and in  5 we present our discussion and conclusion .",
    "to compute a synthetic stellar spectrum , the spectral synthesis code reads a model atmosphere , and a list of molecular and atomic transitions . from the many model atmospheres available in the literature we choose the library from @xcite which is based on atlas9 @xcite",
    "this is an extensive grid of models and according to @xcite it is one that in average , reproduces well the colors of observed stars .    to generate the synthetic spectra we chose the code synthe @xcite in its public linux port by @xcite .",
    "synthe reads the atomic and molecular transition lines in separated files .",
    "the atomic lines are listed in files which are publicly distributed with synthe .",
    "the synthesis codes use the atomic line lists to solve the continuum radiative transfer equation and to determine the absorption lines formation .",
    "the parameters needed for the computation of each line profile are : the central wavelength , the transition levels energy , the oscillator strength @xmath0 ( which is related to the line intensity ) and the broadening parameters ( natural - @xmath1 , stark - @xmath2 and van der waals - @xmath3 broadening ) .",
    "broadening parameters are responsible for the line profile .",
    "the natural broadening comes directly from the heisenberg s uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics : because an electron that finds itself in an energy level has a finite lifetime before transitioning to a lower energy level , the energy levels have a certain width @xmath4 , resulting in a width of the atomic line .",
    "the radiative damping constant @xmath5 is then equal to the sum of the reciprocal of the mean lifetimes of the two atomic energy levels under consideration .",
    "another mode of line broadening is the pressure ( or collisional ) broadening , which is due to the perturbation of the potential of the atom by neighboring particles .",
    "for example , the stark effect is caused by the splitting of degenerate atomic energy levels due to the presence of an external electric field , or a frequency shift for these levels .",
    "another example of pressure broadening is the van der waals process , which is related to the perturbation of an atom s potential by neutral atoms electric dipole .",
    "their definition implies that the stark process will be more important for hotter stars while the van der waals will be more important for cooler stars .    in the present work we choose to calibrate the oscillator strength and the two pressure broadenings - stark and van der waals .",
    "another detail we have to consider to calibrate the lines is that although the same line list is used to generate the spectra of all stars , not every line will be present in all stellar spectra .",
    "the intensity and the profile of each absorption feature is determined by the physical conditions of the stellar atmosphere where the lines are formed .",
    "lines originated from the lowest ionization degrees will be more intense in cooler stars .",
    "on the other hand , lines originated from higher ionization degrees will be stronger on the spectrum of hotter stars .",
    "many other physical parameters can also change the intensity and the profile of the lines , like chemical abundances , gravity , etc .",
    "besides , many lines are blended in the spectrum of a star , which makes it very hard to disentangle the atomic parameters of each line .",
    "ideally , in order to be able to calibrate all the lines in a given line list one would have to attempt to calibrate the lists to a variety of stellar spectral types simultaneously .",
    "in different spectral types , the relative intensity of each line in a blend might be different .",
    "calibrating the line list to all of them simultaneously would better constraint the best solution .",
    "for the task of calibrating the atomic line list we adapted the ce algorithm . the ce method is a general monte carlo approach to combinatorial and continuous multi - extremal optimization and importance sampling , which is a general technique for estimating properties of a particular distribution , using samples generated randomly from a different statistical distribution rather than the distribution of interest .",
    "the ce analysis was originally used in the optimization of complex computer simulation models involving rare events simulations @xcite , where very small probabilities have to be accurately estimated , having been modified by @xcite to deal with continuous multi - extremal and discrete combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "its theoretical asymptotic convergence has been demonstrated by @xcite , while @xcite studied the efficiency of the ce method in solving continuous multi - extremal optimization problems .",
    "some examples of robustness of the ce method in several situations are listed in @xcite .",
    "the ce procedure uses concepts of importance sampling , which is a variance reduction technique , but removing the need for a priory knowledge of the reference parameters of the parent distribution .",
    "the ce procedure provides a simple adaptive way of estimating the optimal reference parameters .",
    "the ce method was already used successfully in astrophysical problems like the study of sources with jet precession @xcite , fitting the color - magnitude diagram of open clusters @xcite and modeling very long baseline interferometric images @xcite .",
    "the basic procedures involved in the ce optimization can be summarized as follows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    \\(i ) random generation of the initial parameter sample , obeying predefined criteria ;",
    "\\(ii ) selection of the best samples based on some mathematical criterion ;    \\(iii ) random generation of updated parameter samples from the previous best candidates to be evaluated in the next iteration ;    \\(iv ) optimization process that repeats steps ( ii ) and ( iii ) until a pre - specified stopping criterion is fulfilled .",
    "let us suppose that we wish to study a set of @xmath6 observational data in terms of an analytical model characterized by @xmath7 parameters @xmath8 .",
    "the main goal of the ce continuous multi - extremal optimization method is to find the set of parameters @xmath9 for which the model provides the best description of the data @xcite . in our case",
    "@xmath6 is the number of stellar spectra we are trying to reproduce , and @xmath10 is three times the number of lines in the interval calibrated ( because we are calibrating three parameters for each line ) .",
    "the technique is performed by generating randomly @xmath11 independent sets of model parameters @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , and minimizing an objective function @xmath14 used to transmit the quality of the fit during the run process . if the convergence to the exact solution is achieved then @xmath15 .    in order to find the optimal solution from ce optimization , we start by defining the parameter range in which the algorithm will search for the best candidates : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the iteration number . introducing @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ", we can compute @xmath20 from :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is an @xmath23 matrix with random numbers generated from a zero - mean normal distribution with standard deviation of unity .",
    "the next step is to calculate @xmath24 for each set of @xmath25 , ordering them according to increasing values of @xmath26 .",
    "then the first @xmath27 set of parameters is selected , i.e. the @xmath27-samples with lowest @xmath28-values , which will be labeled as the elite sample array @xmath29 .",
    "we then determine the mean and standard deviation of the elite sample , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively , as :    @xmath32    @xmath33 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    the array @xmath34 at the next iteration is determined as :    @xmath35    this process is repeated from equation ( 2 ) , with @xmath22 regenerated at each iteration .",
    "the optimization stops when either the mean value of @xmath36 is smaller than a predefined value or the maximum number of iterations @xmath37 is reached . in our case",
    "the stopping criteria is always @xmath37 , as will be explained in section 4 .    in order to prevent convergence to a sub - optimal solution due to the intrinsic rapid convergence of the ce method",
    ", @xcite suggested the implementation of a fixed smoothing scheme for @xmath38 :    @xmath39{\\bf \\sigma}^\\rmn{elite}_j(k-1),\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is a dynamic smoothing parameter at @xmath17th iteration :    @xmath41    with @xmath42 and @xmath43 is an integer typically between 5 and 10 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , such parametrization prevents the algorithm from finding a non - global minimum solution since it guarantees polynomial speed of convergence instead of exponential @xcite .      in order to select the best model that represents our observation we need to define a performance function , based on the desired characteristics of the solution .",
    "usually , for continuous problems this is done by defining a likelihood function and then maximizing it , or alternatively requiring that the sum of the squared residuals be minimal .    in this work",
    "the performance function has to be defined as a way to compare model with observed spectra pixel by pixel . for this comparison",
    "we choose as a performance function the combination of the sum of the squared residuals and their respective variance , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "let the quadratic residual @xmath44 at a given wavelength pixel @xmath45 and iteration @xmath17 be defined as the squared difference between the observed spectrum we want to reproduce , @xmath46 , and the generated model spectrum @xmath47 at a @xmath17-iteration , i.e. @xmath48 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the mean square residual value of the model fitting @xmath49 can be calculated from :    @xmath50.\\ ] ]    as mentioned in the previous section , we need the spectra of stars spanning a range of effective temperatures ( ) , surface gravities ( ) and metallicity in order to guarantee that lines to be calibrate will be present in at least one spectrum . considering @xmath51 as the number of stars used in the calibration , our tentative model spectra obtained from the @xmath51 parameters @xmath52 at iteration @xmath17",
    "are ranked through the performance function :    @xmath53 , \\label{perffunc}\\ ] ]    which corresponds to the product of individual merit functions associated with the @xmath51 stars used in the calibration .",
    "the product of these functions is important to ensure that high luminosity stars do not become more important than low luminosity stars .",
    "note also that , if @xmath46 and @xmath54 are expressed in terms of ergs @xmath55 , @xmath56 has units of ( ergs @xmath57 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we have tested other functional forms for the ce performance function ( as a root mean square , for example ) but equation ( 8) was more efficient to recover the best solution for our problem .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite , the difference in performance is essentially due to the fact that equation ( 8) transmits directly any change in the mean and variance of the residuals in all iteration steps of the optimization process .",
    "as commented previously , ce optimization generates @xmath11 random tentative solutions at each iteration @xmath17 , selecting the best @xmath58 set of model parameters in terms of the values of @xmath56 .",
    "if the stopping criteria is related to a maximum number of iterations , the last iteration might not be exactly the one with the best @xmath56 .",
    "the best values of the parameters @xmath59 , as well as their respective uncertainties @xmath60 , were then determined as follows :    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the iteration where the parameter converged , and @xmath64 represents the set of model parameters that produce the minimum value of @xmath65 among all tentative solutions at iteration @xmath17 and @xmath66 .",
    "the power index -2 in the definition of @xmath67 was adopted in order to make the tentative solutions with the lowest values of @xmath65 more important in the calculation of @xmath59 .",
    "the value of @xmath63 corresponds to the iteration where the value of @xmath64 did not change after a certain number of iterations .",
    "we found that a safe value for this number is 10% of the total number of iterations .",
    "alicce is a code written in c which implements the cross - entropy algorithm to calibrate atomic line lists used in stellar spectral syntehsis .",
    "this version of alicce is adapted to make an external call to synthe code for performing the spectral syntehsis .    for each iteration",
    ", alicce generates @xmath11 different atomic line lists , with each atomic parameter to be calibrated ( @xmath68 ) varying inside a given interval .",
    "it then calls synthe for each of the stars used in the calibration ( three in this validation case ) , for each one of the @xmath11 lists .",
    "the output spectrum generated ( @xmath47 ) for each of the atomic line lists is then compared with the simulated observed spectrum ( @xmath46 ) , and the performance function ( @xmath56 ) is calculated for each of the @xmath11 lists .",
    "alicce then ranks the @xmath11 line lists by @xmath56 ( from the lowest to the highest values ) and recalculate the interval for each atomic parameter based on the mean and standard deviation of the @xmath69 first tentative solutions in the @xmath56 rank ( @xmath69 = 0.05 @xmath11 - see section 3.2 ) .",
    "the process starts again until the stopping criteria is fulfilled .",
    "the first step to calibrate the atomic line list is to choose the wavelength range for the calibration . for this initial validation step",
    "we choose the range from 851.0 to 853.0 nm .",
    "there are two motivations for this choice : ( 1 ) it is a region relatively free of strong molecular transitions , which makes the calibration of atomic lines more robust and ( 2 ) it is inside the wavelength region covered by the gaia mission , which will generate spectra of millions of stars from 8470 to 8740  .",
    "our first goal for the calibrated list is to compute a stellar library for the the gaia mission wavelength range . for the selected range of",
    "only 20  there are almost 290 atomic lines . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we show in table  [ tablelines ] the kurucz line list for the first 5 lines of our range , extracted from the gf1200.100 file from the synthe package .",
    "it is important to realize the amount of calculation needed to calibrate these lists .",
    "for example , in the kurucz line list used here , there is an average of eighteen atomic lines per angstrom , each of these with at least three adjustable parameters .",
    "it is unfeasible to calibrate all these lines manually for hundreds or thousands of angstroms as a stellar library would require .    to validate the calibration technique we used synthetic spectra instead of observed ones .",
    "these spectra were generated with the original line list of kurucz , therefore we know the values of the atomic parameters alicce has to recover . to make the test more realistic we also introduced some random noise in these spectra .",
    "the s / n we used here is 400 , the lower limit we expect for the observations that will be used for the calibrations ( coelho et al . in preparation 40000 ) observations of six nearby stars ( spectral types k2ib , k2/k3iii , a solar twin , f0v , a3 m , and b6iii ) obtained with uves at vlt / eso ( i d 087.b-0308(a+b ) ) . ] ) .",
    "the goal is to verify if alicce is able to recover the atomic parameters without any prior knowledge about their values , only through the comparison of the spectra .    the stars that will be used in the calibration play a crucial role .",
    "as we mentioned before , the ideal case would be to use many stars with different spectral types .",
    "however , in practice , this is unfeasible . the observed stellar spectra that will be used to calibrate the atomic line list need to correspond to stars with atmospheric parameters very well determined as model independently as possible .",
    "the spectra also need to have extremely high resolution and a very high signal - to - noise . in practice , there are very few available spectra in the literature that satisfy these criteria . for this validation project",
    ", we generated the synthetic spectra with the atomic parameters of real stars that will be used in the actual calibration : three well known stars , that have not only very well determined atmospheric parameters but also have very different spectral types : the sun ( g2v ) , arcturus ( k1.5iii ) and vega ( a0v ) .",
    "their atmospheric parameters are listed in table  [ atmospar ] .",
    "the spectra used for our validation process are shown in figure  [ starsobs ] ( continuous line ) .",
    "it is important to mention that not all the lines visible in these spectra are atomic lines . in this figure",
    "we also present the spectra generated only with atomic lines ( dotted line ) .",
    "although strong molecular absorptions are not present , some of the lines in this interval have molecular origin and will not be calibrated by this version of alicce .",

    "it is also important to mention that although we are calibrating only 1.5     at a time , all the spectra are always generated for a much larger wavelength range ( at least 5    to each side ) to ensure no border effect will be important .",
    "another constrain that has to be defined is the interval in which each atomic parameter can vary in the first iteration .",

    "we have this information , but when applying the code for real stars , how will it be possible to distinguish between the correct values and the incorrect converged ones ? it is clear that a simple visual inspection of figure  [ loggfconv ] is not enough .",
    "the criteria to select between the correct converged values and the incorrect ones are shown in figure  [ convcrit ] .",
    "the top figure shows the difference between the average value of @xmath0 found by alicce ( @xmath78 ) and the original value used to generate the comparison spectra ( @xmath79 ) as a function of their uncertainties @xmath80 , as defined in section 2.3 . in this figure",
    "we show that parameters that converged to their expected values have small uncertainties .",
    "these are the lower left points ( small @xmath78 - @xmath79 ) .",
    "some of these points are actually different points superimposed .",
    "it is important to realize that not all points with small @xmath78 - @xmath79 converged .",
    "although their average value oscillates around the expected value , they did not converge to this value , and thus , have larger uncertainties .",
    "we marked all points values of @xmath78 - @xmath81 in blue .",
    "the bottom figure shows this effect more clearly . in this figure",
    "we show the uncertainties in the @xmath0 as a function of the iteration of the convergence , as defined in section 2.3 .",
    "blue points are the same as in the top figure .",
    "lines that converged to their expected values do so in the first iterations . using this as a criteria",
    ", we can identify lines that converged to an expected value even if we do nt know this value a priori , or have any knowledge of their contribution in the spectra of the stars . based on our results we defined that lines that converged to the expected value do so in less than 500 iterations , and have uncertainties smaller than 0.1 .",
    "these limits are marked by dotted lines in this figure .",
    "this is the main reason for the stopping criteria of the method to be the maximum number of iterations ( @xmath37 ) , and not a predefined value of convergence .",
    "given these results we believe that alicce is an efficient tool for the calibration of atomic line lists for stellar spectrum synthesis .    amongst the parameters the code calibrates , @xmath0 was the one with higher success of recovery .",
    "this is not surprising as @xmath0 usually is the main parameter ( amongst the ones studied ) that drives the line profile . for the broadening parameters the recovery rate was much lower .",
    "the recovery of the broadening parameters is extremely dependent on the stellar rotational velocity .",
    "if the rotational velocity is too high , these parameters can not be recovered , since the doppler broadening effect will dominate the line profile . for the velocity of the stars used in these calibrations we can recover the broadening parameter only for very strong lines .",

    "lines that converged to the expected value are located in the bottom left of this figure . ]      we performed a test with real data , applying the method to a small wavelength region from 8517 to 8519   .",
    "figures  [ comp_obs_arc ] and  [ comp_obs_sun ] show the results for the sun and arcturus respectively ( vega is almost featureless in this wavelength region , see fig .",
    "the observed solar spectrum was obtained from @xcite , which is a revised solar flux atlas from @xcite , and arcturus spectrum from @xcite .",
    "this test illustrates the importance of calibrating the line list with more than one star : some of the lines in the synthetic spectra are too weak for one star while too strong for the other .",
    "calibrating these lines for one of the stars alone would induce larger uncertainties in the other . in general ,",
    "both spectra improved as shown by the values of the @xmath82 calculated from the difference between observed and synthetic spectra : 10% improvement for arcturus and 2% for the sun .",
    "the improvement of one line at 8518.028     is particularly obvious .",
    "the non - fitted lines at 8517.30     and 8518.45     indicate possible missing lines in the atomic lines list .",
    "a forthcoming paper will focus on the actual calibration of a larger wavelength window using new high - quality observed data , and with the inclusion of several missing lines .",
    "ideally , the calibration of atomic lines through this process could give us insights on atomic physics and structure .",
    "this would be true if the physics and numerical approximations adopted in the codes used to model atmospheres and spectra were valid , and if the errors in the stellar atmospheric parameters ( temperature , superficial gravity , chemical abundances , etc ) were negligible .",
    "however , it is known that there are a lot of approximations adopted in the models ( e.g. plane - parallel geometry , local thermodynamic equilibrium , convection treatment , etc ) .",
    "this means that when an atomic line in a synthetic spectrum does not fit the observations , many other effects besides their imprecise atomic parameters might be playing a role .",
    "since we have no way of quantifying exactly how much each of these approximations affect the line profiles , it is inevitable that when we calibrate the atomic line list using a given model atmosphere and a given synthesis code the values found might sometimes compensate for these effects .",
    "what comes from this is that the interpretation of the values found in terms of atomic physics might be compromised , and mainly , that the calibrated line list created by alicce should only be used for the same atmosphere models and synthesis codes for which they were calibrated .",
    "in this work we present the validation of the alicce code for calibrating atomic line lists used by spectral synthesis codes to generate stellar spectra called alicce , which uses the cross - entropy algorithm . for validating our technique we simulated a calibration against synthetic spectra with noise of three well known stars with very well determined atmospheric parameters : the sun , arcturus and vega .",
    "the results obtained show that the cross - entropy algorithm is effective to recover the atomic lines parameters used in line lists of spectral synthesis codes for lines with of the continuum flux .",
    "the code was able to recover the @xmath0 of the lines that had reasonable signal in at least one of the three stars .",
    "in addition , the code is able to recover broadening parameters of very strong lines , when they are present .",
    "it is important to realize that the calibration of the atomic line list is tied to a given model atmosphere and synthesis code . in this version of alicce",
    "we used atlas9 model atmospheres and synthe spectral code . any line list calibrated with this version of alicce",
