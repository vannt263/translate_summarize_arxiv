    "polymer brushes are organic surface layers formed by polymer chains that are grafted at one end to a substrate @xcite .",
    "since the thickness of brush layers is typically in the nanometer range , they are interesting for the design of functional surfaces @xcite with applications in a wide variety of areas ranging from colloidal stabilization @xcite , lubrication @xcite , controlled friction and adhesion @xcite , anti - fouling @xcite , biocompatibility@xcite , drug delivery @xcite , and smart stimuli - responsive materials @xcite . in this respect",
    ", multicomponent polymer brushes are particularly promising @xcite . if the brush chains are covalently bound to the substrate , they can not phase separate on a global scale , but they can still develop structure on the nanoscale .",
    "the resulting brush morphologies are controlled both by the intrinsic properties of the brush , e.g. , chemical properties of the chains ( compatibility or incompatibility ) , the grafting densities , the chain lengths , and by the environment - related parameters , such as solvent selectivity , substrate preference , temperature , and the ph . due to the ability of polymer brushes to selectively respond to environmental stimuli",
    ", they can be used to design materials that can reversibly switch / tune their surface properties , e.g. , with respect to wettability @xcite , permeability @xcite , friction @xcite , and optical properties @xcite .",
    "stimuli - induced phase separation provides the basic mechanism for the change in the brush surface properties depending on which of the two microphases forms the outer part of the brush .",
    "a typical example for such a morphology - related switchable surface is a mixed polymer brush with equal amounts of hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers grafted on a substrate . by treatment of different solvents ,",
    "the surface composition can change and then the wettability of this material switches @xcite .",
    "morphology change necessarily involves slow highly cooperative chain dynamics and therefore a typical response time turns out to be in the range of several minutes or larger @xcite .    in a recent letter ,",
    "we have proposed a new class of brush - based switches @xcite , which rely on a radical conformational change of individual adsorption - active minority chains in an otherwise inert brush .",
    "the selective adsorption driving the transition may arise , e.g. , from electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonding between active groups in the minority chains and the substrate .",
    "these active groups can serve as responsive sensors that trigger the switching transition .",
    "the most radical change is associated with the end group of the minority chain . in the adsorbed state it resides in close proximity of the substrate deeply buried within the brush , while in the other state it is exposed to the environment .",
    "thus the transition could potentially promote a specific immune - like response .",
    "chemically or biologically active groups can be attached to the free end of the minority chain to serve as practically useful sensors .",
    "based on theoretical arguments and simple one - dimensional mean - field calculations , we demonstrated that even a small chain length increment of about 10 % produces a sharp transition from the exposed state to the adsorbed state .",
    "the transition time is expected to be very short since the free energy barrier between these two thermodynamically stable states is about several @xmath3 .",
    "a further increase in the minority chain length will lead to sharper transitions , but at the same time to longer transition times due to higher barriers .",
    "the strong response of the chain conformation of a minority chain @xcite to small variations of its length is related to the recently reported `` surface instabilities '' in polymer brushes @xcite , which can be used to sense solvent quality @xcite . in our work",
    ", we proposed to use single chains as switches triggered by a change in substrate - polymer interaction .",
    "one major benefit of this switch is that it does not involve cooperative rearrangements of many chains , therefore the switching transition is fast as compared to the existing examples in mixed brushes .",
    "the arguments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite rely on several assumptions .",
    "first , the presence of the minority chains was taken to have no effect on the surrounding polymer brush .",
    "second , thermal fluctuations of the majority brush component were disregarded .    in the current paper , we present extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of a coarse - grained model for polymer brushes with a single immersed adsorption - active minority chain . to assess the influence of fluctuations separately ,",
    "we have also performed three - dimensional self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations for comparison .",
    "we investigate in detail both lateral and longitudinal characteristics of chain conformations and the various characteristics of the transition .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : mc_model ] outlines the mc model and the simulation scheme .",
    "[ sec : brush ] presents the mc results for a homogeneous monodisperse brush and comparison with the established analytical scf theory , and analyzes the dependence of the renormalized virial coefficient on the effective interaction range .",
    "sec.[sec : theory ] presents a more detailed derivation of the theory for the adsorption - active minority chain sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] the main results of the mc simulations are presented and discussed . this section also compares mc and 3-d scf calculations with the emphasis on fluctuation effects .",
    "a general discussion is given in the final section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the simulation community , a variety of numerical methods have been developed and used to investigate polymer brush systems , ranging from molecular dynamics @xcite , dissipative particle dynamics @xcite , and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite to numerical self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the present study mainly relies on mc simulations , while for comparison we also present results obtained from 3-d scf theory .",
    "the mc simulation model and scheme are described as follows , and the detailed description of scf method is shown in the appendix .    in the mc simulations ,",
    "we adopt a coarse - grained off - lattice model first proposed by laradji et al @xcite . in this approach , a particle - based representation of the polymers",
    "is combined with an edwards type hamiltonian @xcite , which defines non - bonded interactions in terms of local monomer densities .",
    "compared to the more commonly used coarse - grained polymer models with hard - core monomer interactions , the laradji model has two advantages : first , it can be simulated very efficiently , since the explicit evaluation of pair interactions is often the most time consuming part in a simulation .",
    "second , it uses soft potentials , hence equilibration times are comparatively short .",
    "the model does not account for packing effects and for topological constraints ( which may restrict the conformational phase space for strongly adsorbed , quasi - two dimensional polymers )",
    ". however , these are not in the focus of the present study .    specifically , the model system is a monodisperse brush in a good solvent containing a single minority chain in a volume @xmath4 .",
    "we use periodic boundaries along @xmath5 and @xmath6 directions , while impenetrable boundary walls are placed at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "polymer chains are modelled by the discrete gaussian bead - spring model with spring constant @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the statistical bond length , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath12 the temperature .",
    "we will use @xmath10 as the basic length unit , and @xmath3 as the energy unit .",
    "all chains are attached to a substrate placed at @xmath13 at one end , where @xmath13 is chosen smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "the impenetrable wall at @xmath7 exerts an attractive potential to all minority chain beads with strength @xmath14 in a range of @xmath15 .",
    "there is no explicit solvent in the model and all the relevant interactions in the good solvent case are represented through an effective excluded volume potential between monomers ( beads ) .",
    "the edwards type hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes the position of the @xmath19-th bead in the @xmath20-th chain ( the minority chain has the index @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 is the total number of brush chains , @xmath23 denotes the local density of minority chain monomers , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 the total density of monomers with @xmath26 being the local density of brush monomers .",
    "( here and in the following , the subscript @xmath27 will be used to denote the brush chains , and @xmath28 will denote the minority chain . ) the first two terms in the hamiltonian describe the gaussian stretching energy ( bonded interactions ) between two neighboring monomers in the same chain .",
    "the third term represents the non - bonded effective interactions between polymer beads . for a good solvent",
    "the excluded volume parameter @xmath29 is larger than zero .",
    "the fourth term describes the adsorption between the substrate and the minority beads with a step - like adsorption potential , @xmath30    in the mc simulations , local densities are extracted from the position of the beads by using the particle - to - mesh technique @xcite , which provides a way for the smoothing of density operators . in the present work we use the zeroth order scheme .",
    "the system is divided into cubic cells of size @xmath31 whose centers define the grid points , and the local densities evaluated by counting the total number of beads in the corresponding cells divided by the cell volume , are defined at these grid points .",
    "the smoothed monomer densities for the minority chain and brush chains are denoted as @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "this implies that two beads interact only when they are in the same cell , and thus the size of the cell is indirectly linked to the interaction strength of non - bonded interactions .",
    "higher order schemes are conceivable , but computationally more expensive .",
    "after the density operators are smoothed over the cell volume , the hamiltonian acquires the familiar form used in the scf theory @xcite , hence scf calculations and mc simulations can be compared directly .    in the present study ,",
    "the brush chain length is fixed at @xmath34 . in most mc of calculations",
    "we choose the excluded volume parameter @xmath35 which would correspond to a flory - huggins parameter @xmath36 in an explicit solvent solution ( athermal solvent condition ) , and the size of the averaging cell is taken @xmath37 .",
    "we model relatively dense monodisperse polymer brushes in good solvent with the surface grafting density @xmath38 , with the corresponding overlap parameters @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the mean radius of gyration for an ideal brush polymer .",

    "we try to move the position of one chosen monomer to a new position with a distance in space comparable to the bond length .",
    "this trial move results in an energy change including the bonded energy and non - bonded energy , and it is accepted or rejected according to the boltzmann probability in the usual way . in all the simulations",
    "@xmath46 mc steps per monomer were performed to equilibrate the system , and another @xmath46 mc steps to extract statistical averages . in order to get good statistics sampling for    the single minority chain , an additional @xmath47 mc steps per monomer updating the minority chain monomers were performed during the process of evaluating statistical averages .",
    "final statistical quantities were obtained by averaging the results from 48 separate independent mc runs .",
    "we first analyze the simulation results for homogenous monodisperse brushes which are very well understood .",
    "in contrast to common mc polymer models our model contains an additional free parameter , the cell size @xmath27 , defining the averaging volume for the local density operator , and the excluded volume parameter @xmath29 .",
    "[ fig : pure_brush ] shows the density profiles of homogeneous brushes with two different grafting densities @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and various values of the averaging cell size @xmath27 .",

    "@xcite and subsequently verified by simulations and experiments .    within the second virial approximation for good solvent conditions and assuming gaussian elasticity for the chains , the density profile @xmath50 has a parabolic form @xmath51 where the brush height is @xmath52 , and @xmath53 an effective interaction parameter .",
    "gaussian elasticity is an important ingredient in the analytical theory and the fact that the mc simulation model is also based on a hamiltonian with a gaussian term describing chain connectivity allows a more direct comparison .",

    "we consider a relatively dense monodisperse polymer brush in a good solvent containing a single surface - active minority chain .",
    "the length of the minority chain is denoted as @xmath75 , while the length of the brush chain is denoted as @xmath76 . the minority chain and the brush chains are chemically different and have different interactions with the substrate , i.e. , the substrate adsorbs minority chain monomers with strength @xmath14 , while it is neutral to the brush chain monomers . both the minority and the majority chains are flexible with the same statistical kuhn length @xmath10 which is taken as the unit length ;",
    "the excluded volume parameter is also the same for both chain types and is positive corresponding to good solvent conditions .",
    "this is fully consistent with the mc model .",
    "we treat the inter- and intrachain interactions in the mean - field approximation and neglect the back effect of the change in the minority chain conformation on the surrounding brush .",
    "hence , the conformation of a minority chain is affected by a fixed mean - field potential profile consisting of the repulsive contribution determined by the brush density and a short - ranged attraction due to the solid substrate .",
    "the minority chain itself is described by an ideal continuum model , since intrachain excluded volume effects are screened out considerably within the brush thickness .    the analytical description of the minority polymer chain is based on the continuum approach .",
    "the green s function @xmath77 , i.e. the total statistical weight of the minority chain grafted at the substrate ( @xmath78 ) as a function of the free end position , @xmath79 , is a solution of the edwards equation @xmath80 taken at @xmath81 , with the initial condition @xmath82 .",

    "when comparing the actual brush density profile with the theoretical parabolic shape , one concludes that the pseudopotential must account for the combined effect of the actual adsorption potential ( a step of unit width with energy @xmath97 ) and the short - range depression in the brush density near the wall .",
    "it is known that for weak adsorption , the free energy per monomer is determined by the crossover exponent @xmath98 .",
    "for an ideal chain , @xmath99 while the value for a chain with excluded volume was a subject of extensive investigations and prolonged debates @xcite .",

    "the scf results differ from the mc date in two important aspects .",
    "first , they do no capture the attractive contact interaction of the minority chain with the surface accurately .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the interaction vanishes on the scale of one grid size , and it leads to a shift of the adsorption curves by a constant value @xmath174 .",
    "second , the density fluctuations at the brush surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : density_scaled ] ) effectively reduce the ( spatial ) range of the repulsive potential , hence the minority chain is less stretched in the exposed state .",
    "this effect is even observed for minority chains that have the same length than the brush chains , @xmath175 .",
    "we will see below that this leads to a reduction of the free energy barrier between the exposed and the adsorbed state . after shifting the scf curves by @xmath176 and rescaling them with a factor @xmath177 which was obtained empirically , they are in very good agreement with the mc results .",
    "curves such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zend ] , which give the average distance of the minority chain free end from the surface as a function of the adsorption strength , can be used to localize the crossover between the adsorbed and the desorbed state .",
    "the transition point @xmath178 is then defined as the point where the slope of the curve is maximal ( for @xmath179 ) .",
    "the value of the slope at this point is used to extract the width of the transition , @xmath123 .",
    "this is done as follows .",
    "first we find the point where @xmath170 vs @xmath171 has the maximum slope , and calculate this slope as @xmath180 .",
    "then we draw a line through this maximum slope point with the slope @xmath180 and find its intersection with ( i ) the abscissa and ( ii ) with a line parallel to the abscissa that corresponds to the value of @xmath170 at @xmath137 . the absolute value of the difference of the adsorption strength at these two intersection points ( i.e. , difference of their abscissa values ) defines the transition width @xmath181    in order to study the transition mechanism we analyze the distribution of minority chain ends , which we denote as @xmath182 .",
    "the product @xmath183 represents the probability to find the free end in a layer with its @xmath79 coordinate ranging from @xmath79 to @xmath184 . in the mc scheme ,",
    "@xmath182 is evaluated as follows : we split the simulation box along the @xmath79 direction into @xmath185 layers , where each layer has the volume @xmath186 and an index @xmath187 ranging from @xmath188 to @xmath189 .",
    "then @xmath190 is obtained by counting how often the free end was located in the @xmath187th layer , divided by @xmath191 and by the total size of the sample .",
    "[ fig : pz ] shows examples of distributions @xmath192 for a minority chain of length @xmath193 in a brush with grafting density @xmath49 .",
    "one can clearly see that two populations of different conformations ( adsorbed and exposed ) are involved in the transition . in the transition region",
    "these populations coexist which is reflected by a bimodal distribution .",
    "specifically one can see that at low adsorption strength ( e.g. , @xmath194 ) , the chain end is mostly located outside of the brush , whereas at high adsorption strength ( e.g. , @xmath195 ) , the chain end is localized close to the surface . at intermediate adsorption strengths ( @xmath196 ) , the adsorbed and the exposed state coexist and the minority chain switches back and forth from one to the other .",
    "a conventional way to analyze a phase transition is to construct a  landau free energy \" from the logarithm of the statistical distribution of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "we will use the position @xmath79 of the free end of the minority chain as the order parameter . in this case",
    "the landau free energy is @xmath197 .",
    "selected free energy curves are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : freeenergy ] .",
    "the free energy as a function of chain end position has one minimum close to @xmath7 for large @xmath14 ( adsorbed state ) , and one minimum close to @xmath198 for small @xmath14 ( exposed state ) .",
    "for intermediate @xmath14 , these two minima compete with each other .",
    "an alternative definition of the transition point @xmath199 is the point where both minima have equal depth .",
    "however , we wish to stress that at finite chain length , there is no classical phase transition , but rather a crossover point between two regimes .",
    "the height of the free energy barrier between the exposed state and the adsorbed state , @xmath200 , is extracted from the landau function curve at this transition point .",
    "the equal depth condition for the transition point makes the barrier height definition unambiguous . in the following we compare the transition characteristics as obtained by simulations to the scaling prediction of the analytical theory laid out in section [ sec : theory ] .",
    "[ fig : mc_transition_point ] displays the transition point , i.e. the adsorption energy @xmath178 as a function of the scaling parameter @xmath201 combining the grafting density , and the ratio of the minority - to - majority chain lengths .",
    "two definitions of @xmath178 have been proposed above , and data points corresponding to both definitions are presented .",
    "each set collapses into a single master curve close to the straight line suggested by eq.([eq : transition_point ] ) but due to the effect of finite chain length the lines are separate .",
    "we expect the difference to vanish in the appropriate thermodynamic limit @xmath202 , where the transition becomes truly sharp .",
    "the general trend is that the transition point shifts to larger adsorption strength @xmath203 with increasing minority chain length and grafting density .",
    "this is to be expected , since both factors stabilize the exposed state against the competing adsorbed state .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_transition_point ] , the intercept and the slope are linked to the model - specific dependence of the adsorbed chain s free energy on @xmath14 , which were therefore treated as free parameters by the theory .",
    "one has to be cautious , however , not to overestimate the agreement between theory and simulations .",
    "the scaling predictions rely on two assumptions : ( i ) logarithmic corrections are neglected , implying that the relevant free energies per chain are much larger than 1 ( in @xmath204 units ) , @xmath205 ; ( ii ) the adsorption is assumed to be weak , such that the expansion of @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu_epsilon ] ) can be applied , @xmath206 . at brush chain lengths @xmath207 , it is difficult to satisfy both conditions simultaneously . in systems with small values of @xmath135 and/or small @xmath57 ,",
    "the first condition becomes questionable , whereas in systems with larger @xmath135 and/or larger @xmath57 , the second condition may be violated .",
    "therefore , the observed reasonably good collapse onto a straight line might be the result of cancellation effects .",
    "the two most important characteristics of the transition , as far as potential applications are concerned , are the transition sharpness ( or effective width ) and the waiting time characterizing the transition kinetics .",
    "the present work does not include dynamic simulations , so we use the free energy barrier at the transition as an indirect measure of the waiting time .",
    "the transition width , denoted as @xmath123 and characterized by the inverse slope of @xmath208 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sharpness_raw ] as a function of the minority chain length increment @xmath135 , while the barrier height ( in units of @xmath204 ) is displayed in the fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier_raw ] .",
    "we present both the mc results ( symbols ) and the scf results ( lines ) . the transition becomes sharper for longer minority chains and larger grafting densities .",
    "the difference between the mc and the scf results for @xmath209 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sharpness_raw ] ) is noticeable but not dramatic . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : sharpness scaling ] ) ) , the transition sharpness is essentially determined by the response of the free energy of the adsorbed state to variations of the adsorption strength @xmath14 , which does not seem to be affected by fluctuations very much .",
    "in contrast , the effect of fluctuations on the free energy barrier is quite strong .",
    "the free energy barrier grows approximately linearly with @xmath135 and also increases with the grafting density .",
    "the absolute values of the barrier height obtained by mc simulations are smaller than those from scf method by roughly a factor of 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier_raw ] ) .",
    "this is clearly a pronounced effect of density fluctuations implying strong consequences on the transition kinetics .",
    "the same data are replotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig : transition_scaled1 ] ) with scaling coordinates as suggested by the analytical theory , see eqs ( [ eq : sharpness scaling]),([eq : barrier scaling ] ) .",
    "the curve for @xmath123 vs. @xmath210 is expected to pass through the origin since in the thermodynamic limit , one has @xmath211 , and the transition becomes jump - like with @xmath212 . at finite brush chain length @xmath76 and for larger values of the scaling parameter @xmath210 finite chain length effects and logarithmic corrections become important .",
    "this presumably explains why the data do not collapse on a master curve , and why the scf data do nt even seem to converge towards the expected behavior @xmath213 at @xmath211 .",
    "the mc data are better compatible with a limiting straight line passing through the origin , and the slope has the correct order of magnitude . according to the theoretical expectation ( eqs ( [ eq : transition_point ] ) and ( [ eq : sharpness scaling ] ) ) the slope in fig .",
    "[ fig : sharpness_scaled1 ] should exceed that in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc_transition_point ] by a factor of @xmath214 .",
    "the actual slopes differ by a factor of 2.3 .",
    "[ fig : barrier_scaled1 ] displays the energy barriers at the transition as a function of @xmath215 .",
    "the scf data are quite close to collapsing onto a single straight line , as predicted by eq.([eq : barrier scaling ] ) while the mc data are not .",
    "although the direct proportionality to the chain length increment @xmath135 is still satisfied reasonably well , the effect of increasing the grafting density is stronger than predicted by the theory .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the values of the barrier height @xmath200 obtained from mc simulations lie in the range between 0.5 and 5 @xmath216 , whereas the theory assumes that the two states are well separated , implying @xmath217 .",
    "thus the asymptotic behavior assumed by the theory is not yet reached , which may explain the poor data collapse .",
    "it is worth noting that the data do seem to obey an apparent scaling @xmath218 as illustrated by fig.[fig : barrier_scaled2 ] .",
    "we are not aware of a theoretical reason for such a scaling .",
    "the observed apparent scaling might be the purely fortuitous result of various corrections to the analytical theory , which relies on several somewhat questionable assumptions as discussed above .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated in detail conformational properties and phase transition behavior of a type of stimuli - responsive polymer materials using particle - based monte carlo simulations and continuum - based 3-dimensional self - consistent field theory .",
    "this type of stimuli - responsive materials is designed based on a polymer brush with a small fraction of adsorption - active minority chains introduced in the brush , and the minority chain can work as a responsive sensor .",
    "the basic mechanism for this responsive sensor relies on the conformational switch of the minority chain .",
    "the adsorption between the substrate and the minority chain serves as the trigger that switches the chain conformations . in practice , the trigger could also be a temperature or solvent composition change . upon varying the adsorption strength ,",
    "two states were observed , one being an exposed state , in which the free end of the minority chain is located at the outside surface of the brush and possesses a stem - crown - like configuration , and the other being an adsorbed state , in which the minority chain is located at the adsorbing substrate in a nearly 2-dimensional confinement .    , the barrier height is significantly smaller in the mc simulations . ]",
    "one important purpose of the present study was to highlight the effect of fluctuations by comparing two numerical methods applied to one and the same model , namely mc simulations and 3d scf calculations .",
    "the comparison shows that the scf theory roughly captures the sharpness of the transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sharpness_scaled1 ] , but overestimates the barrier height ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier_scaled1 ] ) . as discussed earlier , density fluctuations at the outer brush surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : density_scaled ] ) effectively reduce the range of the repulsive barrier created by the brush and hence the degree of chain stretching in the exposed state ( see fig.[fig : zend_mc_scf ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the free energy barrier between the adsorbed and the exposed state is also reduced .",
    "the practical importance of this effect can be seen when plotting the barrier height against the sharpness of the transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier_vs_sharpness ] ) .",
    "the transition sharpness is a measure for the sensitivity of the switch to small changes in the environment .",
    "it can be tuned by adjusting the minority chain length or the grafting density . assuming that it has been tuned to a certain value , fig .",
    "[ fig : barrier_vs_sharpness ] demonstrates that the corresponding barrier height between coexisting states at the transition is greatly reduced in the mc simulations compared to the scf prediction .",
    "since the barrier height determines the time required for switching between states , this can drastically reduce the response times of the switch .",
    "for example , for @xmath219 , the reduction can be as high as @xmath220 , and according to a simple arrhenius - type estimate this would lead to a speedup of the switching time by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the switching time is one major issue for the quality of sensors or other responsive materials . in our previous work @xcite , we performed overdamped brownian dynamics simulations of a single switch chain in a static brush potential to estimate the switching time . by tracking the position of the free end bead of the minority chain",
    ", we found that this bead could jump between two well separated positions ( which correspond to the exposed and adsorbed state , respectively ) during a time about @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is the characteristic relaxation time of a single monomer , which is typically on the order of @xmath223 seconds for flexible chains .",
    "we thus estimated the switching time to be on the order of milliseconds .",
    "however , in that calculation , the brush was represented in a simplified manner by a parabolic profile and the coupling between the minority chain and the brush chains was neglected , which presumably leads to a large deviation from the true switch time .",
    "molecular dynamic simulations that model a brush - minority chain system in a dynamic manner are clearly desirable .    in the present study ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to systems with good solvent conditions , and assume that two - body interactions dominate , thus we only consider excluded volume interactions .",
    "however , for dense brushes , higher order contributions will become important .",
    "higher order terms in the free energy virial expansion provide corrections that lead to some change in the brush height and in the overall free energy of the competing states .",
    "hence one would expect corrections to the properties of the switching transition , in particular the barrier height at transition . in the case of very dense grafting",
    "these corrections may be significant but this falls outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "besides fluctuations , another factor that must be taken into account in real systems is polydispersity . in the present study ,",
    "the brush polymers were taken to be monodisperse .",
    "real polymer brushes , however , are always polydisperse , and it has been demonstrated that polydispersity significantly alters both the equilibrium properties @xcite and dynamical properties @xcite of materials . using a one - dimensional scf theory ,",
    "we have performed a preliminary study of a system with an adsorption - active chain embedded in a polydisperse brush with a continuous schulz - zimm length distribution .",
    "we found that for @xmath224 , the switch sharpness is similar to that of the monodisperse brush obtained by 1-dimensional scf theory ; however , the switch barrier is reduced .",
    "this suggests that the switching mechanism should be at least as effective in polydisperse brushes than in monodisperse brushes , the switching might even be faster . further and more detailed studies are currently under way .",
    "an important question pertaining to the mc scheme used in our work is the choice of the size of the density averaging cell , @xmath27 , which has the meaning of an interaction range . in section [ sec : brush ] we have shown that the effective excluded volume parameter appears as the result of a renormalization of the `` bare '' parameter due to density fluctuations . for a given set of parameters @xmath58 and @xmath225 , where @xmath10 is the statistical segment length unit , the brush profile is uniquely defined by @xmath53 or , more precisely , the corresponding second virial coefficient in the mc model , @xmath226 , while the renormalization factor @xmath71 was shown to be a function of a single dimensionless variable @xmath70 .",
    "the renormalization of monomer interaction parameters has been studied for single flexible swollen chains @xcite , in the context of dense polymer systems @xcite , and in the field - theoretical context @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize that polymer brushes simulated by mc in the laradji version @xcite represent a class of model systems where renormalization effects are quite strong and can be extracted easily .",
    "the basic tenet is that large - scale properties should depend only on the renormalized excluded volume parameter while its bare value may become relevant on small length scales comparable to @xmath10 or @xmath27 .",
    "one consequence in our system is that the brush profiles very close to the outer surface can not be described by a single renormalized @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : density_scaled ] ) , and that the surface interaction parameter @xmath14 has to be renormalized independently from @xmath29 ( as has been done in fig .",
    "[ fig : zend_mc_scf ] ) .",
    "however , even after taking into account the renormalization of interaction parameters , we find that the properties of chains in close vicinity and above the brush surface are still strongly influenced by density fluctuations .",
    "the density fluctuations at the brush surface significantly reduce the free energy barrier between the exposed and the adsorbed state in fig.[fig : barrier_vs_sharpness ] .",
    "thus , the minority chain serves as a delicate probe of both local and large - scale fluctuation effects .",

    "<S> using a combination of analytical theory , monte carlo simulations , and three dimensional self - consistent field calculations , we study the equilibrium properties and the switching behavior of adsorption - active polymer chains included in a homopolymer brush . the switching transition is driven by a conformational change of a small fraction of minority chains , which are attracted by the substrate . depending on the strength of the attractive interaction , </S>",
    "<S> the minority chains assume one of two states : an exposed state characterized by a stem - crown - like conformation , and an adsorbed state characterized by a flat two - dimensional structure . comparing the monte carlo simulations , which use an edwards - type hamiltonian with density dependent interactions , with the predictions from self - consistent - field theory based on the same hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , we find that thermal density fluctuations affect the system in two different ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , they renormalize the excluded volume interaction parameter @xmath0 inside the brush . the properties of the brushes can be reproduced by self - consistent field theory if one replaces @xmath0 by an effective parameter @xmath1 , where the ratio of second virial coefficients @xmath2 depends on the range of monomer interactions , but not on the grafting density , the chain length , and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> second , density fluctuations affect the conformations of chains at the brush surface and have a favorable effect on the characteristics of the switching transition : in the interesting regime where the transition is sharp , they reduce the free energy barrier between the two states significantly . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling behavior of various quantities is also analyzed and compared with analytical predictions . </S>"
