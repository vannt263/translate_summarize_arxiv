    "the effect of electron - positron pair production in vacuum by a strong electric field was first considered by sauter @xcite as early as in 1931 , see also @xcite .",
    "schwinger was the first who had derived the exact formula for the probability of pair creation in a static electric field @xcite and since then this process was often called the schwinger effect .",
    "the probability of pair creation acquires its optimum value when the electric field strength is of the order of the `` critical '' for qed value @xmath2 v / cm .",
    "clearly , such field strength is unattainable for static fields experimentally in near future .",
    "therefore attention of many researchers was focused on theoretical study of pair creation by time - varying electric fields @xcite .",
    "nowadays , a very strong time - varying electromagnetic field can be practically realized only with laser beams .",
    "first experiments dealing with nonlinear qed effects caused by high energy electrons and photons interacting with intense laser pulses have been carried out recently .",
    "first , the observation of nonlinear compton scattering in the collision of @xmath3 gev electron with a laser pulse of @xmath4w/@xmath5 intensity has been reported @xcite .",
    "then , the same group of researchers has observed electron - positron pair creation in collision of laser photons , backscattered to gev energies by the @xmath3 gev electron beam , with an intense laser pulse @xcite .",
    "the results of the latter experiment were the first laboratory evidence for inelastic light - by - light scattering involving only real photons .",
    "however , the intensities of existing now lasers are far lower than the value @xmath6w/@xmath5 corresponding to the critical qed field @xmath7 . the estimations @xcite show that pair creation by a single laser pulse in vacuum , or even in collision of two laser pulses , could be hardly observed with lasers of intensity @xmath8 . therefore the results of refs .",
    "@xcite were commonly believed to be of purely theoretical interest .",
    "fortunately , the latest achievements of laser technology promise very rapid growth of peak laser intensities . tajima and mourou",
    "has suggested recently @xcite a path to reach an extremely high - intensity level of @xmath9w/@xmath10 already in the coming decade .",
    "such field intensities are very close to the critical value , @xmath7 .",
    "hence the more detailed study of the schwinger effect in time - varying electromagnetic fields , in particular in the field of a focused laser pulse , is becoming an urgent physical problem from experimental point of view also .    as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a plane electromagnetic wave of arbitrary intensity and spectral composition does not create electron - positron pairs in vacuum because it has both field invariants @xmath11 and @xmath12 equal to zero .",
    "therefore we consider the effect in the field of a focused circularly polarized laser pulse which is described by a realistic 3-dimensional model developed in ref .  @xcite . unlike the case of spatially homogeneous time - varying electric field used in refs .",
    "@xcite , the utilized model is based on an exact solution of maxwell equations .",
    "the model has been already successfully used in ref  @xcite for quantitative explanation of anisotropy of electrons accelerated by a high - intensity laser pulse which was observed in experiment of malka _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the method we use in the present paper for calculation of the number of pairs created by the laser pulse is based on the fact that the characteristic length of the process is determined by the compton length @xmath13 which is much less than the wavelength @xmath14 of the laser field , @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , at arbitrary point of the pulse we can calculate the number of created particles per unit volume and unit time according to the schwinger formula for the static homogeneous field and then obtain the total number of created particles as the integral over the volume @xmath16 and duration @xmath17 of the pulse @xmath18 here @xmath19 are the reduced fields , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the field invariants which have the meaning of electric and magnetic fields in the reference frame where they are parallel . the invariants @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of invariants @xmath22 and @xmath23 , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath24    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we consider the model of the focused laser pulse field and calculate the field invariants .",
    "the qualitative discussion of the pair production process is carried out in sec .",
    "we present the results of numerical calculations of the pair production probability in sec .",
    "the summary of the results and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "it is well known that the electromagnetic field of a focused light beam is not transverse .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , one can not ascribe some definite type of polarization to it .",
    "however , we can always represent the field of a focused beam as a superposition of fields with transverse either electric , or magnetic vector only , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "for each of these fields we can define the type of polarization with respect to that vector which is transverse .",
    "we will call such fields @xmath0- or @xmath1-polarized fields respectively .",
    "it can be verified straightforwardly that there exists the following exact solution of maxwell equations which describes a wave propagating along the @xmath25 axis @xcite @xmath26 @xmath27 + 2i\\delta e^{\\pm i\\phi}\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial \\xi}{\\bf e}_z \\right\\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath28 is the wave frequency , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath25 are spatial coordinates , and @xmath31 the fields ( [ e_e ] ) and ( [ h_e ] ) are solutions of maxwell equations if function @xmath32 obeys the equation @xcite @xmath33 and function @xmath34 is defined by the relation @xmath35 the fields ( [ e_e ] ) , ( [ h_e ] ) describe a focused beam if functions @xmath36 are chosen so that they tend to zero sufficiently fast when @xmath37 and satisfy the following conditions @xmath38 in this case the parameter @xmath39 can be interpreted as the radius of the focal spot , @xmath40 as the diffraction length @xcite , and @xmath41 as the focusing parameter . if @xmath42 the solution ( [ e_e ] ) , ( [ h_e ] ) describes a plane wave .    even if the laser beam is focused so that @xmath43 ( this corresponds to the diffraction limit ) , @xmath44 . therefore in our calculations we will always assume that @xmath45 . under this assumption",

    "we will identify the field ( [ e_e ] ) , ( [ h_e ] ) with circularly @xmath0-polarized focused light beam .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields in the circularly @xmath1-polarized beam are given by the following expressions @xcite @xmath47 for discussion of other types of polarizations of focused light beams see ref .",

    "the waves of such type are commonly called gaussian beams .",
    "we will work with expressions ( [ g_b ] ) for functions @xmath48 throughout the paper .    to describe a laser pulse with finite duration @xmath17 one should introduce @xcite a temporal amplitude envelope @xmath50 making the following substitutions in eqs .",
    "( [ e_e ] ) , ( [ h_e ] ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 it is assumed that the function  @xmath50 is equal to unity at the point  @xmath53 and decreases exponentially at the periphery of the pulse for @xmath54 . in this case",

    "now , using the model described in the preceding section , we will give a qualitative estimate of the number of pairs created by a focused laser pulse in vacuum .",
    "taking into account that pairs are created mainly near the focus , we assume that the spatial volume of the pulse is of the order of @xmath60 and the number of created pairs is given by the following expression @xmath61 instead of eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) . here",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath63 are the averaged over time values of dimensionless field invariants @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the focus .    using eqs .",
    "( [ invs ] ) , ( [ g_b ] ) we easily find that in the focus @xmath66 invariants @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the lowest approximation with respect to @xmath41 are equal to @xmath67 it immediately follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eh ] ) that at the focus of the @xmath0-polarized pulse @xmath68 while for the @xmath1-polarized pulse we have @xmath69 so we conclude that pairs can be created only by a @xmath0-polarized but not @xmath1-polarized pulse . this statement is not exact however .",
    "we will see in the next section that @xmath1-polarized pulse also create pairs though their number is several orders of magnitude less then in the case of @xmath0-polarized pulse .",
    "now we can estimate the number @xmath70 of pairs created by a @xmath0-polarized focused pulse .",
    "however , it is convenient to express @xmath70 in terms of laser intensities instead of @xmath62 . to do this , we begin from the pointing vector averaged over fast oscillations of electromagnetic field of the pulse @xmath71 using explicit expressions for functions @xmath72 ( [ g_b ] )",
    ", we obtain for the energy flow through the focal plane @xmath73 the total energy carried by the pulse is @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath17 is the pulse duration .",
    "further on we will use the gaussian temporal amplitude envelope @xmath76 , for which @xmath77 by definition , the intensity @xmath78 is @xmath79 the factor @xmath80 in the right - hand side of the latter equality has arisen due to the fact that the mean value of the electric field in the pulse is less than its peak value @xmath81 . for the averaged over time invariant @xmath62 we get using eqs .",
    "( [ eps_e ] ) and ( [ inv_f ] ) @xmath82 finally we obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) , ( [ eps_a ] ) @xmath83    let us estimate the number of pairs created by the @xmath0-polarized pulse with critical peak electric field @xmath84 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 fs . in this case @xmath88w/@xmath10 and according to eq .",
    "( [ n_est ] ) @xmath89 .",
    "if intensity of the same pulse is equal to critical value @xmath90 we have @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "we see that the number of created pairs grows very fast with intensity . indeed ,",
    "only three times increase of intensity yields three orders of magnitude in the number of created pairs .",
    "let us now compare the rest energy of created pairs with the total energy carried by the laser pulse which according to eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) for accepted values of parameters @xmath93 and @xmath17 is given by the following formula @xmath94 we see that the energy of the pulse with intensity @xmath95 is of the order @xmath96 and hence is of the same order as the rest energy of created pairs @xmath97 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the exploited method becomes inconsistent and one should take into account back reaction of the pair creation effect on the process of laser pulse focusing at such intensity . in other words , one can not consider the electromagnetic field of the pulse at near critical intensities as a given external field and should take into account depletion of the pulse due to pair production .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the critical intensity @xmath98 can hardly be achieved for at least the @xmath0-polarized focused laser pulse in optical range .",
    "we will discuss the situation with @xmath1-polarized pulses in sec .  v.    to conclude this section",
    ", we should emphasize that it follows from eq .",
    "( [ n_est ] ) that the number of created pairs @xmath99 at @xmath100w/@xmath10 for the same values of parameters @xmath93 and @xmath17 in @xmath0-polarized pulse .",
    "hence we can say that the effect of pair creation becomes observable just at intensity of such order of magnitude .",
    "the peak value of electrical field for the pulse of such intensity is of the order of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and the rest energy of created pairs @xmath103 .",
    "the last inequality approves the application of our method to the considered problem at @xmath100w/@xmath10 .",
    "in this section we present the results of numerical calculations of the number of created pairs ( [ nt ] ) by the fields ( [ e_e ] ) , ( [ h_e ] ) .",
    "figs .  1 , 2 demonstrate the dependencies of invariants @xmath20 and @xmath21 for a @xmath0-polarized wave on spatial coordinates @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the time moments @xmath104 respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     one can see from the table [ < table > ] that the estimates obtained in the previous section agree rather well with the results of numerical calculations .",
    "the estimates appeared to be especially successful at @xmath105w/@xmath10 .",
    "however we underestimate ( overestimate ) the number of created pairs at lower ( higher ) intensities the estimate yields approximately one order of magnitude .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the higher is intensity , the sharper is the peak of the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ nt ] ) .",
    "this means that the higher is intensity , the smaller is the effective radius @xmath106 of the area providing the principal contribution into the integral ( [ nt ] ) . at @xmath107 , while at @xmath108 and at @xmath109 .",
    "this point has not been taken into account by our method of estimation .",
    "in the present paper we have studied the effect of pair creation by a circularly polarized focused laser pulse in vacuum . to describe the focused laser pulse we have used a 3-dimensional model of electromagnetic field based on an exact solution of maxwell equations @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the number of created pairs strongly depends on configuration of the electromagnetic field in laser focus and on dimensionless focusing parameter @xmath41 .",
    "pairs are created most effectively by a @xmath0-polarized pulse .",
    "indeed , for the @xmath0-polarized laser pulse with @xmath110 , and @xmath85 , the effect becomes observable at intensity @xmath111w/@xmath10 , while for the @xmath1-polarized pulse with the same set of parameters only at @xmath112w/@xmath10 . in both cases the pair creation process begins at intensities essentially less than the characteristic value @xmath113w/@xmath10 .",
    "it is worth noting that the peak value of the electric field in the focus in both cases is less than the critical qed value @xmath7 .",
    "as it was mentioned in the preceding section , this is explained by a very large value of the effective laser pulse 4-volume , where pairs are effectively created , in comparison with the characteristic compton 4-volume , @xmath114 .",
    "one can see from the table [ < table > ] that for the @xmath0-polarized pulse with the same @xmath14 and @xmath17 but with @xmath115 the effect becomes observable only at intensity @xmath116w/@xmath10 .",
    "a very important consequence of our investigation is existing of a natural physical limit for attainable focused laser pulse intensities .",
    "this limit is posed by the effect of pair creation and for the circularly @xmath0-polarized laser pulse with @xmath117 , and @xmath85 is approximately @xmath118 , see sec .",
