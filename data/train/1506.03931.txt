    "recently , the atlas collaboration reports excesses in searches for massive resonances decaying into a pair of weak gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "these excess events have been observed in the hadronic final states , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath8 ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) channels .",
    "the weak gauge bosons from the resonance are highly boosted so that the hadronic decay products are reconstructed as two fat jets .",
    "constructing the invariant mass of these two fat jets , it is possible to find a resonant peak for the intermediate state .",
    "the atlas collaboration has performed such an analysis by using 20.3  fb@xmath11 data of the 8  tev lhc running .",
    "then , the excesses with narrow widths are observed around @xmath0  tev in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 channels with local significance of 3.4@xmath15 , 2.6@xmath15 , and 2.9@xmath15 , respectively .",
    "although we should wait for forthcoming atlas / cms results of relevant searches to obtain a robust consequence about the observation , it should be worthwhile to consider possible interpretations of these anomalous events as evidence for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "in fact , the excesses are well fitted with resonances whose peaks are around 2  tev and widths are less than about 100  gev .",
    "such narrow resonances may imply new weakly - interacting particles , and then the underlying theories would be perturbative . in this paper ,",
    "we especially consider such a possibility to explain the excesses .",
    "as mentioned above , the excesses reported by the atlas collaboration are in the @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 channels .",
    "the tagging selections for each mode used in the analysis are , however , rather incomplete : about 20% of the events are shared by these channels . at the present stage , it may be hard to conclude that one resonance is responsible for the excesses in all the channels",
    ". there may be a possibility that one 2-tev particle contributes to only one part of the channels and the peaks in the other channels are merely contamination due to the incomplete tagging selections .",
    "taking this situation into account , in this paper , we do not limit ourselves to account for all of these excesses simultaneously , and consider the possibility that the new resonance appears in one channel . for each channel",
    ", the number of excess events could be accounted for if there is a 2  tev resonance whose production cross section times decay branching ratio into gauge bosons is about 6 fb .",
    "we regard this as a reference value in what follows .    in order for a resonance to decay into two gauge bosons",
    ", it should be a bosonic state , namely , a particle with a spin zero or one under an assumption of the renormalizable theory .",
    "let us first consider the spin - zero case . if such a particle is a singlet under the @xmath16 gauge interactions , it couples to the electroweak gauge bosons and the sm fermions only through the mixing with the sm higgs boson in the renormalizable potential .",
    "therefore , its production cross section is suppressed by the mixing factor and in general too small to explain the anomalies . a possible way to enhance",
    "the production is to introduce new vector - like colored particles . a singlet scalar field generically couples to these colored particles .",
    "then the singlet is produced via the gluon fusion process according to the loop correction involving the vector - like colored particles .",
    "if the masses of the vector - like particles are above 1  tev , such a scalar resonance with 2 tev mass does not decay into these particles .",
    "it turns out , however , that @xmath17  fb production cross sections require @xmath17 extra colored particle pairs .",
    "moreover , a large fraction of produced singlets decays into gluons , and thus gives only a negligible contribution to the diboson channels .",
    "hence , a singlet scalar boson is inappropriate to explain the anomalies .",
    "an alternative possibility is to exploit @xmath18 doublet scalars .",
    "these scalar fields may develop a finite vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to directly couple to @xmath19 and @xmath10 , and again mix with the sm higgs field . to assure a large cross section to the diboson decay processes , there should be a sizable deviation from the sm limit .",
    "in addition , the deviation modifies the higgs couplings , which are stringently constrained by the higgs data at the lhc experiments . within the constraint ,",
    "both the production cross section and the branching ratios to the electroweak gauge bosons of a 2  tev doublet scalar are found to be extremely small .",
    "a higher representation of @xmath18 also suffers from its small production cross section since it does not couple to the sm quarks directly . for these reasons ,",
    "we conclude that it is quite difficult to explain the required event rate with a new scalar particle , and thus we do not pursue this possibility in the following discussion .",
    "another candidate is a spin - one vector boson .",
    "such a particle naturally appears if a high - energy theory contains additional gauge symmetry that is spontaneously broken at a certain scale above the electroweak scale .",
    "if the symmetry breaking occurs at the tev scale , we expect the masses of the extra gauge bosons to be @xmath20  tev .",
    "the gauge bosons are produced at the lhc if quarks are charged under the extra gauge symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we investigate this possibility .",
    "an important caveat here is that such a tev - scale vector boson has been severely constrained by the lhc experiments .",
    "the strongest constraint is usually from the drell - yan processes @xcite ; for a 2  tev vector boson , its production cross section times the branching ratio in the lepton final states should be much smaller than 1  fb .",
    "this bound makes it quite difficult to realize a sizable event rate for the diboson decay channel in most extensions of the sm with new gauge symmetries .",
    "one promising setup to suppress the drell - yan processes is given by an @xmath18 singlet heavy charged gauge boson with hypercharge @xmath21 , which we denote by @xmath22 .",
    "such a @xmath22 is contained in some simple extensions of the sm , such as @xmath23 models @xcite .",
    "this @xmath22 couples with right - handed quarks , as well as right - handed charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "if right - handed neutrinos are rather heavy , @xmath22 is unable to decay to leptons and thus evade the drell - yan bounds . since @xmath22 couples to the right - handed quarks , it is sufficiently produced at the lhc .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath22 bosons mix with the electroweak gauge bosons , which allows @xmath22 to decay into @xmath19 and @xmath10 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wprime ] , we study whether @xmath22 can explain the observed excess .",
    "we find that it is difficult to realize large decay branch into @xmath12 in a simple version of the @xmath22 model , and therefore the required event rate for the atlas diboson excess is not obtained once the limit from the electroweak precision measurements is taken into account . even if this limit is avoided by canceling the @xmath22 contribution to the electroweak precision observables with other new physics effects , the resonance search in the channel consisting of a @xmath19 boson and a higgs boson ( @xmath24 ) @xcite severely constrains the @xmath12 decay branch .",
    "besides , @xmath25 generally predicts flavor changing gauge couplings @xcite , as the @xmath19 boson does in the sm .",
    "we have to assume these couplings to be flavor - diagonal to evade the strong bounds from flavor physics .",
    "this gives rise to additional complexity for a concrete model building in this direction .",
    "an alternative way is to regard the resonance as a neutral massive gauge boson @xmath26 which has no coupling to the sm leptons .",
    "this is the so - called leptophobic @xmath26 .",
    "such a leptophobic @xmath26 may be realized in the grand unified theories ( guts ) ; if the rank of the gut group is larger than four , it includes extra u(1 ) symmetries , and a certain linear combination of the u(1 ) charges could be leptophobic .",
    "especially , a set of charge assignments inspired by the e@xmath27 guts has been widely studied so far in the literature @xcite .",
    "the drell - yan bounds on this class of models are then readily avoided because of the leptophobic nature .",
    "again , @xmath26 mixes with the @xmath10 boson after the electroweak symmetry breaking , and thus it has a decay mode into a pair of @xmath28 .",
    "we study the decay properties of such a @xmath26 using a simplified model in sec .",
    "[ sec : zprime ] to see whether it could explain the atlas diboson signal .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we conclude our discussion and give some future prospects for probing the scenarios in the future lhc experiments .",
    "to begin with , we consider a simplified model for @xmath22 to study whether it explains the atlas diboson signal or not",
    ". for recent works on phenomenological studies of @xmath22 , see ref .  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we consider an su(2)@xmath29 singlet vector boson with @xmath30 hypercharge as a candidate for @xmath31 , since it effectively has no coupling to the sm leptons and thus avoids the severe drell - yan bounds .",
    "such a vector boson may be attributed to a gauge boson of a non - abelian gauge group orthogonal to su(2)@xmath29 , like su(2)@xmath32 .",
    "we may also take up an su(2)@xmath29 triplet non - hypercharged vector boson , which , for instance , appears in the @xmath33 type models @xcite . in this case , however , couplings of the su(2)@xmath29 triplet vector bosons to the sm charged leptons are generically allowed , and thus we need an additional mechanism to suppress these couplings to evade the drell - yan constraints . in this sense , the su(2)@xmath29 singlet vector boson is more favored , and thus we focus on this candidate in our work .",
    "let us denote the massive su(2)@xmath29 singlet vector boson by @xmath34 .",
    "there are scalars charged under the additional su@xmath35 symmetry , and they develop nonzero vevs to cause the su@xmath35 symmetry breaking",
    ". then @xmath34 gains a tev - scale mass .",
    "we assume that some of the scalars are charged under su(2)@xmath29 as well and the finite mass mixing between @xmath34 and @xmath36 in the sm is generated by their vevs .",
    "the mix is described as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath31 are the mass eigenstates .",
    "we expect the mixing angle @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mass of @xmath22 and @xmath42  gev is the higgs vev .",
    "then , the partial decay width of @xmath31 into @xmath38 and @xmath10 is given as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the su(2)@xmath29 gauge coupling and @xmath45 is the mass of @xmath19 boson . from this expression , we find that although the partial decay width is suppressed by the small mixing angle @xmath39 , this suppression is compensated for by the enhancement factor of @xmath46 .",
    "this enhancement factor results from the high - energy behavior of the longitudinal mode of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we expect a sizable decay branch for the @xmath47 channel . the partial decay width gets increased as the mixing angle becomes large .",
    "the size of the mixing angle is , on the other hand , restricted by the electroweak precision measurements since it is induced by interactions which break the custodial symmetry ",
    "namely , the bound on the @xmath48 parameter @xcite constrains the mixing angle . the current limit on @xmath39",
    "is given by @xmath49 for @xmath50  tev @xcite , which in turn gives an upper limit on @xmath51 .",
    "we however note that the constraints may be evaded if there is another contribution to the @xmath48 parameter which cancels the effects of the @xmath19-@xmath22 mixing .",
    "the actual realization of this possibility is model - dependent , and we do not pursue it in this paper .",
    "the equivalence theorem tells us that the final state gauge bosons in the @xmath52 channel could be regarded as nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons , since the longitudinal mode dominates the decay amplitude as we have just mentioned .",
    "thus , the partial decay width of the channel is related to that of the decay to @xmath38 and the higgs boson in the final state .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "currently , the cms collaboration gives an upper bound on this decay mode @xcite as @xmath55  fb .",
    "thus , through the above equation , this bound also implies @xmath56  fb , which somewhat conflicts with the atlas diboson anomaly . since the above relation is a consequence of the equivalence theorem , this bound is robust and almost model - independent .",
    "for this reason , a @xmath22 model ( as well as a @xmath26 model as we will see in the next section ) in general predicts smaller number of signals in the diboson channel than that observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , once we consider the limit on the @xmath24 channel .",
    "@xmath34 carries the @xmath30 hypercharge , so that the @xmath57 symmetry allows the following couplings the right - handed quarks : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 denotes the generation index . here",
    ", we assume the coupling constant @xmath61 is common to all of the generations and ignore flavor non - diagonal parts for brevity , which are in fact stringently constrained by the measurements of the flavor observables , such as the @xmath62-@xmath63 mass difference . at the lhc",
    ", @xmath22 is produced via the interactions in eq .  .",
    "for @xmath22 with a mass of 2  tev , the production cross section at the lhc with the center - of - mass energy @xmath64  tev ( lhc8 ) is evaluated as @xmath65 ~,\\ ] ] using madgraph @xcite .",
    "after the production , @xmath22 mainly decays into the @xmath12 , @xmath24 , or quark final states . the partial decay width for the final state containing a pair of @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "is given by @xmath68 where we neglect the quark masses for brevity .",
    "the branching fraction of this decay mode is severely constrained by the dijet resonance searches @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have @xmath69 with the acceptance @xmath70 being assumed .",
    "the atlas collaboration gives a similar limit on the dijet channel @xcite .",
    "currently , the @xmath71 decay mode is less constrained @xcite : @xmath72  fb .    taking the above discussion into account , in fig .",
    "[ fig : wlimit ] , we show a contour plot for @xmath73 on the @xmath61-@xmath39 plain .",
    "the light - green shaded region is disfavored by the electroweak precision measurements : @xmath74 .",
    "the dark - green and blue shaded regions are excluded by the limits from the @xmath75 @xcite and the dijet @xcite channels , respectively .",
    "this figure clearly shows that it is difficult to explain the observed diboson resonance with this simplified @xmath76 model once the electroweak precision bound on the @xmath19-@xmath22 mixing is taken into account .",
    "even if this constraint is avoided by utilizing other new physics effects to cancel the @xmath22 contribution to the electroweak precision observables , the bound on the @xmath75 channel restricts @xmath73 to be less than @xmath77  fb .",
    "one of the most popular models in which an su(2)@xmath29 singlet @xmath22 appears is the so - called left - right ( lr ) symmetric model based on the @xmath23 gauge theory . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath22-quark coupling is given by the su(2)@xmath32 gauge coupling constant @xmath78 ; @xmath79 .",
    "if right - handed neutrinos in this model are heavier than @xmath22 , then @xmath22 does not decay into the right - handed neutrinos , and thus this model realizes the setup of the simplified model we have discussed here . in this model , the sm higgs field is embedded into a bi - fundamental representation of @xmath80 .",
    "once this bi - fundamental field acquires the vev , the @xmath19-@xmath22 mixing is induced and given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the su(2)@xmath29 gauge coupling constant and @xmath83 is the ratio between the diagonal components of the bi - fundamental higgs vev . in fig .",
    "[ fig : wlimit ] , we also show the value of @xmath39 obtained through this relation as a function of @xmath79 for @xmath84 in the brown dashed line .",
    "this value of @xmath85 is favored to explain the top and bottom quark masses in this model .",
    "it is found that although the predicted values evade the electroweak precision bound , it is far below the values required to explain the diboson excess .    before concluding this subsection , we comment on other possible excesses reported so far which might also indicate the presence of a @xmath22 with a mass of around 2  tev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cms collaboration reported a small excess near 1.8  tev in the searches of @xmath22 decaying into @xmath19 and higgs boson in the @xmath86 final state .",
    "however , as we have seen above , this conflicts with another constraint on the @xmath75 channel given by the cms experiment @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cms collaboration announced a possible signal in the searches of @xmath22 decaying into the two electrons and two jets final state through a right - handed neutrino , whose peak is around @xmath87  tev with its significance being @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "though there have been several proposals for @xmath22 models that account for the @xmath89 excess @xcite , the models in general predict too small event rates for the diboson channel , and therefore fail to explain the atlas diboson resonance signal .",
    "next , we consider a leptophobic @xmath26 . for reviews on @xmath26 models ,",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite . we regard it as a gauge boson accompanied by an extra u(1 ) symmetry , u(1)@xmath90 , whose mass is generated after the u(1)@xmath90 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "suppose that there are two su(2)@xmath29 doublets and one singlet higgs bosons @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , respectively , with their @xmath94 charges being @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath91 only couples to the up - type quarks while @xmath92 couples to the down - type quarks and charged leptons , just as the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) and the type - ii two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "we require u(1)@xmath90 to be leptophobic , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath98 , and then this leads to @xmath99 .",
    "after these higgs bosons acquire vevs , the mass matrix for the @xmath94 gauge field @xmath100 and a linear combination of the @xmath18 and @xmath101 gauge fields ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively ) , @xmath104 , is given by @xmath105 with @xmath106 here @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 are defined .",

    "the mass eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath116 are then obtained through the diagonalization with an orthogonal matrix as @xmath117 with @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the masses of @xmath10 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "again , the mixing angle is suppressed by a factor of @xmath121 .",
    "the couplings of @xmath122 to the sm fermions @xmath123 are given by @xmath124 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 the u(1)@xmath90 charges of the left- and right - handed components of @xmath123 , respectively . here",
    "again , we have neglected possible flavor changing effects for simplicity .",
    "now let us evaluate the partial decay widths of @xmath26 .",

    "on the other hand , we have @xmath130 note that this decay width again remains sizable even though the decay mode is induced via the @xmath10-@xmath26 mixing , since the enhancement coming from the longitudinal polarization mode compensates for the suppression factor .",
    "according to the equivalence theorem , this decay width becomes equivalent to that of the @xmath131 mode in the decoupling limit : @xmath132 from the above equations , we find that the decay properties of @xmath26 are determined by the u(1)@xmath90 charges of quarks and @xmath91 , the u(1)@xmath90 gauge coupling constant @xmath115 , and @xmath133 . among them , we can always decrease one degree of freedom via the redefinition of the u(1)@xmath90 charge normalization . in what follows ,",

    "[ fig : zprime ] , the total decay width is well below 100  gev in the allowed parameter region in the figure .",

    "second , in this model , there are new tree - level contributions to the higgs mass : the @xmath170-term contribution via the singlet - higgsino coupling just like the nmssm and the @xmath171-term contribution of the extra u(1)@xmath90 . taking into account these contributions as well as the one - loop correction to the cp - even scalars @xcite , we find that the observed value of the higgs mass @xmath172  gev @xcite is accounted for with @xmath173  tev stops and a small value of @xmath85 when @xmath1740.5 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the mssm prediction ; in this case , if stops have masses of around 1  tev , the observed higgs mass is achieved with a large value of @xmath83 , while if @xmath85 is small then stops in general have masses much larger than @xmath173  tev to explain the higgs mass .",
    "notice that the 2-tev @xmath26 favors tev - scale susy particles since the susy and u(1)@xmath90 breaking scales are related to each other through the soft mass term for @xmath93 in the scalar potential , which triggers the u(1)@xmath90 breaking .",
    "therefore , this model provides a natural framework for a light stop scenario without conflicting with the 125  gev higgs mass , which is desirable from the viewpoint of the electroweak fine - tuning problem . as various particles are predicted to have masses of @xmath175  tev , not only the further investigations of the diboson events , but also the direct searches of these particles in the lhc run - ii play an important role to test this model . in this model",
    "may be different from those presented above if some of the additional particles have masses smaller than @xmath176  tev . ]",
    "we have considered some extensions of the sm that could explain the excesses recently reported by the atlas collaboration @xcite .",
    "these possible signals are found in the diboson resonance searches with two fat jets in the final state , and to account for the signals , production cross sections of @xmath177  fb with narrow decay widths are required .",
    "these excesses may be reproduced by an extra vector boson with @xmath0-tev mass , and we investigated the @xmath25 and @xmath178 models , especially .",
    "@xmath25 boson is , for example , predicted by the additional su(2)@xmath32 gauge symmetry , and decays to not only the sm fermions but also @xmath19 and @xmath10 bosons through the @xmath19-@xmath25 mixing .",
    "there is a tension between the excess and the bounds from the drell - yan processes , which forces us to forbid the leptonic decay of @xmath22 by making the right - handed neutrinos heavy .",
    "we also suffer from the tree - level flavor changing couplings of @xmath25 , and thus we need to find out a way to forbid the couplings . besides , the constraint from the electroweak precision measurements is too severe to reproduce the excess in the diboson channel .",
    "eventually , we conclude that it is difficult to interpret the diboson signal as the @xmath22 resonance , unless the above difficulties are evaded with additional conspiracy .",
    "@xmath178 boson is another good candidate for the diboson resonance .",
    "it also appears in various new - physics models ; for instance , an extra u(1)@xmath179 symmetry is predicted by the guts based on large gauge groups , in which the u(1)@xmath180 charges are generally assigned to the sm fermions and the higgs field according to their gauge structure . in this case , the @xmath26 associated with this u(1)@xmath180 symmetry decays to a pair of the sm fermions , @xmath181 and @xmath182 through the @xmath10-@xmath178 mixing generated by the kinetic mixing and mass mixing due to the nonzero vev of the u(1)@xmath90-charged higgs field .",
    "again , a leptophobic @xmath26 has an advantage to suppress the drell - yan bound . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zprime ] , we investigate such a possibility and find that there is a sizable parameter region that could explain a large part of the excess and is still allowed by the current experimental constraints .",
    "we also consider a concrete leptophobic @xmath26 model inspired by the e@xmath27 gut , and discuss its implication on the higgs mass and the susy scale .",
    "this model predicts the new vector - like particles and the susy particles to have tev - scale masses , which are accessible at the next stage of the lhc running .",
    "we therefore expect that the future lhc experiments may not only provide us a deeper understanding for the atlas diboson excess , but also shed light on new physics behind simplified models discussed in this paper .",
    "finally we briefly comment on the diboson resonance searches performed by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration has searched for resonances decaying into two gauge bosons in hadronic final states @xcite , similarly to the atlas search @xcite , as well as in semi - leptonic final states @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a small excess was found in both of these searches around 1.8  tev for the resonance mass , which might be the same origin as the atlas diboson anomaly .",
    "if it is not the case , the semi - leptonic search result @xcite gives a stringent limit on the 2  tev excess observed by the atlas collaboration .",
    "after all , further searches of the diboson events are indispensable for confirming or excluding the 2  tev diboson anomaly , and are to be done in the near future .",
