    "[ sec : intro ]    black holes are expected to form in a significant fraction of massive star deaths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it seems possible that in at least some of these cases the black hole will form without generating an outgoing shock . what observable signal would accompany such an event ?",
    "would they all be `` un - novae '' @xcite , stars that just disappear from view , or will some sort of transient display announce the birth of any black hole ?",
    "if the progenitor star was rotating , then a variety of energetic transients might be possible depending on the distribution of angular momentum , ranging from common gamma - ray bursts by the collapsar mechanism @xcite to long duration x - ray @xcite and gamma - ray @xcite transients .",
    "but what if the star were rotating very slowly or not at all ?",
    "pulsations @xcite or acoustic energy transport @xcite may lead to envelope ejection , but these either occur in stars that are uncommonly massive or depend on details of gravity wave propagation that are still to be worked out .",
    "here we follow on a suggestion by @xcite which provides a simple mechanism for ejecting at least some mass in supernova progenitors with very weakly bound envelopes , i.e. , red supergiants . in all but extremely rare super - massive stars , iron core collapse leads to protoneutron star formation @xcite .",
    "the protoneutron star must then emit a considerable fraction of its mass - energy as neutrinos before either settling down as a cold degenerate object or contracting inside its event horizon and becoming a black hole .",
    "this is true even if the protoneutron star continues to accrete substantial mass while contracting .",
    "in fact , in that case , the total energy emitted should be close to the binding energy of a neutron star with its maximum stable gravitational mass , which we allow to vary in the range 2.0 - 2.5 @xmath0 in our model .",
    "as frequently noted , this huge energy loss also results in a decrease in the gravitational mass of the compact object @xcite .",
    "this mass loss is of order @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gravitational mass of the cold neutron star .",
    "this implies a mass loss of approximately 0.2 - 0.5 @xmath0  over a period of several seconds , far shorter than the sound crossing time for the helium and heavy element core .",
    "this `` mass '' streams out through the presupernova star at the speed of light without interacting appreciably . to the remaining star",
    "it simply appears that the gravitational potential of the core has abruptly decreased . in response",
    ", the star begins to expand . in this paper",
    "we simulate this mass loss and the resulting expansion to determine whether it is capable of creating a shock with sufficient energy to reach the outer layers of the star and , if it does , to eject mass and form a visible transient .",
    "it is important to note that this expansion precedes the loss in support pressure caused by the collapse of the core . that rarefaction passes out through the star on a slower , free - fall time scale",
    "we began with two presupernova models calculated using the kepler stellar evolution code .",
    "kepler is a lagrangian 1d implicit hydrodynamics code with the appropriate nuclear physics , mass loss , opacities , and equations of state for studying massive star evolution @xcite .",
    "it is not courant - limited , allowing it to follow a star from its formation to the collapse of its iron core .",
    "however , because kepler uses a lagrangian grid , it can not easily implement an absorbing inner boundary condition .",
    "consequently , it can not accurately follow the infall of the star once a compact object has formed at its center .",
    "once the presupernova models calculated by kepler reached supersonic collapse speeds in their cores , they were thus mapped into castro for further study .",
    "castro is a multidimensional eulerian radiation - hydrodynamics code with adaptive mesh refinement , stellar equations of state , nuclear reaction networks and self - gravity @xcite .",
    "the calculations were done in one dimension with reactions turned off , and the central object modeled as a point of variable mass . an eulerian grid with constant mesh and spherical geometry",
    "was employed .",
    "after the collapse had proceeded long enough in castro to allow shock propagation to the base of the hydrogen envelope , the results were then mapped back into kepler again and the final hydrodynamics and a light curve were calculated .",
    "hydrodynamics and radiation transport in the region immediately surrounding a protoneutron star or black hole is complex and difficult to model .",
    "a realistic simulation of the neutrino transport alone is well beyond the scope of this paper and the outcome would depend upon the chosen neutron star equation of state and the dimensionality of the calculation .",
    "since we are only interested in the temporal evolution of the central gravitational potential , however , reasonably good results can be obtained from parametrized calculations with a generic , qualitative description of the neutrino energy loss .",
    "the inner boundary of our simulation is placed , in castro , at the outer edge of the pre - collapse iron core .",
    "matter interior to this boundary is treated as a point having variable gravitational mass .",
    "initially this mass is equal to the baryonic mass of the interior matter , i.e. , the iron core mass . as time passes that gravitational mass decreases due to neutrino emission and , if no mass were added , it would eventually decrease to the known cold neutron star value for a given baryonic mass and equation of state @xcite .",
    "however , appreciable mass does accrete , leading in the more interesting cases to the formation of a black hole . during the accretion phase neutrinos continue to carry away effective mass .",
    "since we neglect rotation , we assume that , after the black hole forms , matter and energy flow into the black hole without any more emission .",
    "an upper limit to the mass lost is given by the gravitational binding energy of the maximum stable neutron star mass , the `` tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) limit '' @xcite .",
    "current best limits place this parameter in the range 2.0 to 2.5 @xmath0of gravitational mass  @xcite . the characteristic time scale for this loss , which is assumed to occur exponentially ,",
    "is given by the cooling timescale parameter @xmath7 , taken here to be 3 seconds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for this simple case , the mass loss rate is @xmath8 this equation gives an upper bound on the mass loss and therefore on the strength of the transient produced .",
    "this model is referred to as the `` maximum mass loss '' case .",
    "somewhat more realistically , we can take into account the time for the critical mass to accrete and follow the neutrino energy losses that occur during that time .",
    "for each bit of mass that accretes , some fraction of its gravitational binding energy is radiated away promptly , but more is emitted with a delay since the neutrinos must diffuse out .",
    "once the black hole has formed , the neutrino - emitting material falls within the event horizon much faster than the neutrino diffusion timescale , and any energy that has not been released by the time of collapse ends up in the black hole @xcite .",
    "the protoneutron star is also extremely hot and thus behaves in a slightly different manner from cold neutron stars .",
    "we represent the protoneutron star as a low - entropy core surrounded by a hot envelope and track three masses : @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the baryonic mass , i.e. all mass that either was inside the inner boundary at the time of collapse or subsequently accretes through the inner boundary .",
    "@xmath12 is the effective gravitational mass of the hot neutron star , which is _ not _ , in general , equivalent to @xmath13 , the gravitational mass of a _ cold _ neutron star with the same baryon content .",
    "this is the mass that defines the gravitational potential in the outer part of the star .",
    "@xmath10 accounts for the difference in mass - energy stored in this hot neutron star as opposed to a cold one , due to both its higher internal energy and inflated radius .",
    "this extra internal energy diffuses away on the cooling timescale @xmath7 .",
    "the gravitational mass @xmath12 of the hot neutron star is then : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the cold neutron star binding energy . as matter",
    "accretes a fraction @xmath16 of the subsequent change in binding energy is assumed to be trapped and added to @xmath10 while the remaining fraction 1 - @xmath16 is radiated promptly as neutrinos .",
    "the trapped energy diffuses out on a cooling timescale @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath10 is thus given by @xmath17 and the initial condition @xmath18 .",
    "the derivative @xmath19 is evaluated from the binding energy equation , eq .",
    "[ eq : be ] .",
    "once all @xmath10 has diffused away , i.e. the neutron star has cooled , eq .",
    "[ eq : mth ] reduces to the standard cold neutron star equation @xmath20 . assuming rapid virialization of the accreted material implies that the parameter @xmath16 should not exceed @xmath21 .",
    "as the cooling timescale at the surface is likely less than the timescale for the full pns , @xmath16 is likely to be much lower . in the limit that the cooling timescale were much shorter than the accretion timescale , @xmath16 would go effectively to zero . for our models",
    "we adopt @xmath22 . in section [ sec : realistic ] we test the effects of varying this parameter and find them to be small .",
    "the emission halts when the neutron star has accreted past the tov maximum mass limit",
    ". however this limiting mass must be adjusted for the neutron star s evolving heat content",
    ". therefore we wait until the cold core of the neutron star ( @xmath23 ) has accreted past the tov limit before we assume the core has become a black hole and shut off the neutrino emission . from this point on",
    "the central object behaves as a purely gravitational point mass that absorbs all of @xmath24 .",
    "this is referred to as the `` full loss '' model .",
    "figure [ fig : mass ] shows an example of the full model for rsg15 , tov = 2.5 @xmath25 .",
    "the blue curve shows @xmath11 , the total baryonic mass that has entered the core region ( precollapse core plus accretion ) ; it is higher than the black curve showing @xmath12 , the effective gravitational mass of the core .",
    "the red curve shows @xmath10 , which decays exponentially as the protoneutron star cools .",
    "the green curve shows the cumulative mass loss in the simulation .",
    "even though the core in this case lives for almost 24 s as a neutron star , most of the mass loss occurs during the first 5 seconds .",
    "the two presupernova models used for this paper were red supergiants with a zams mass of 15 @xmath25 ( rsg15 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsg15 ] , and 25 @xmath25 ( rsg25 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsg25 ] , both of solar metallicity .",
    "they are taken from the survey of @xcite .",
    "both stars shed substantial amounts of mass before reaching the end of their lives .",
    "the 15 @xmath25 star represents a more common supernova progenitor , while the 25 @xmath25 model has a more compact structure and may be more likely to make a black hole promptly .",
    "the observed upper limit on the progenitor masses of standard core - collapse supernovae found to date is 18 @xmath25 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that higher mass progenitors are more likely to collapse in a non - traditional way , or that these progenitors are preferentially obscured .",
    "model rsg15 has a helium core of 4.27 @xmath25 that extends to @xmath26 cm .",
    "rsg25 has a helium core of 8.20 @xmath25 that extends to @xmath27 cm .",
    "both red supergiants have an extended , tenuously - bound hydrogen envelope extending from the helium core out to @xmath28 that is easily ejected .",
    "the net binding energy of the envelope external to what is nominally the helium core ( where the hydrogen mass fraction declines to 1% ) is @xmath29 erg , but a short distance out at 4.48 @xmath0  this declines to @xmath30 erg , a value that characterizes most of the hydrogen envelope .",
    "these values include internal energy but not the energy potentially available from recombination .",
    "for the 25 @xmath0  model , the net binding energy external to the helium core is @xmath31 erg , but this declines to 10@xmath32 erg when the interior mass increases from 8.20 @xmath0  to 8.36 @xmath0and a still smaller value characterizes most of the envelope .",
    "we note that the recombination of 10 @xmath0  of hydrogen ( 13.6 ev per atom ) would release @xmath33 erg .",
    "some additional parameters of both models can be found in table 1 .",
    "also given is the compactness parameter , @xmath34 , as defined by @xcite , but computed at the time when the star is moved to castro rather than at the time of core bounce .",
    "a star with a higher compactness parameter has a denser region surrounding its core ; for our purposes , this means it will accrete to the tov limit faster and therefore potentially lose less mass as neutrinos .",
    "because of the extended size of the red supergiant progenitors , we do not carry the entire star on our simulation grid in castro .",
    "instead we model only the helium core and base of the hydrogen envelope .",

    "without an outgoing shock or mass loss from neutrinos , the inner layers of the star should collapse directly into the black hole .",

    ", it eventually falls into the core .",

    "physically , this scenario corresponds to prompt black hole formation , when the core collapses without passing through an intermediate protoneutron star stage .",

    "the overall mass in the simulation ( solid ) drops accordingly , then becomes constant as mass loss ceases .",

    "changes in @xmath16 have a small but real effect on the total mass loss , depending on the amount of accreted mass .",
    "the more mass accreted , the more important @xmath16 will be . as higher tov limit models tend to accrete longer",
    ", @xmath16 has a higher impact here .",
    "a lower epsilon leads to a higher mass loss as less of the binding energy is temporarily trapped as thermal mass .",
    "we tested the range @xmath40 , identified as the physically reasonable range of this parameter .",
    "for the case where the tov limit is 2.5 @xmath25 , the most sensitive , a change of 0.05 in @xmath16 in rsg25 resulted in approximately a 0.011 @xmath25 change in the overall mass loss . in the extreme case",
    "@xmath41 , this will make a tov = 2.5 @xmath25 model look like a tov @xmath42 2.35 @xmath25 model . for lower tov limits",
    ", the effect of varying @xmath16 was smaller .",
    "thus , although a change in @xmath16 will affect the mass decrement and by extension the shock strength , the results are robust .      the kinetic energy of the shock that reaches the hydrogen envelope is strongly influenced by the size of the presupernova core and the overlying stellar structure through which it must travel , as can be seen by the differences in kinetic energy between rsg25 and rsg15 in the maximum mass loss model .",
    "this model loses the same amount of mass in the same time regardless of stellar structure , but the final shock in rsg25 models is significantly weaker than in rsg15 , having propagated through a much heavier carbon - oxygen and helium core before reaching the hydrogen envelope .",
    "additional effects come into play when using the full neutrino model based on the speed at which the core accretes .",
    "rsg25 has a denser inner structure ( higher compactness ) and a more massive iron core of 1.83 @xmath25 , compared to 1.63 @xmath0 .",
    "as it therefore accretes faster than rsg15 and is already closer to the tov limit , the core spends significantly less time in the protoneutron star state ; consequently the same choice of parameters in the larger star causes less mass loss .",
    "the full mass loss model in rsg25 also shows systematically lower mass decrements than the maximum mass loss model in all cases , indicating that even with a high tov limit and a relatively long - lived protoneutron star , not all the binding energy is being emitted before collapse to a black hole .",
    "the six shocks produced in rsg25 are shown in figure [ fig : rsg25lim ] .",
    "in the case of prompt black hole formation in a star without a high-@xmath43 outer layer , there is no shock and no visible transient - the star simply disappears .",
    "here we consider further the case of protoneutron star formation and delayed collapse , in which an outgoing shock has formed .",
    "will a detectable transient be produced , intermediate between a complete disappearance and a traditional explosion , as raised by @xcite ? to evaluate this question we took models from castro where the shock had reached @xmath44 cm ( the limit of the simulation ) and mapped them back into kepler , then continued to evolve them .",
    "figures [ fig : keplershock ] and [ fig : keplerenv ] show the kepler results for rsg15 , tov = 2.5 ; figure [ fig : keplershock ] shows the imported shock , and figure [ fig : keplerenv ] shows the final velocity of the hydrogen envelope at @xmath45 s.    the shock has decreased significantly in strength by the time it reaches the base of the hydrogen envelope ; however , this envelope is very tenuously bound in both rsg15 and rsg25 . for each model we tested six choices of tov limit ( 2.0 - 2.5 @xmath25 , in 0.1 @xmath25 increments ) and evaluated the strength of the shock that reached the hydrogen envelope . using the full neutrino loss model , we found in every case tested for rsg15 and in 3 of 6 tested for rsg25 that the shock produced was larger than 1@xmath37 ergs , the approximate binding energy of the envelope ( see table 3 ) .",
    "we can therefore realistically expect the envelope to be ejected in these cases . however , the highest kinetic energy achieved was only of the order of 6@xmath37 ergs , and most models fell well below that number .",
    "the envelope is therefore ejected with a very low velocity ( 50 - 100 km / s ) .",
    "it emits most of its energy via hydrogen recombination .",
    "optically this transient has a low luminosity @xmath46 ergs / s , but maintains this luminosity for of order a year .",
    "the color temperature of the transient is very red , of order 3000 k. an example light curve can be seen in figure [ fig : keplerlc ] for rsg15 , tov = 2.5 .",
    "the transients calculated here are obviously much fainter and less energetic than standard core - collapse supernova , but they do bear some similarity to a class of recently - observed transients : the  luminous red novae , \" such as v838 mon @xcite .",
    "luminous red novae are too bright to be ordinary classical novae , but too faint and red to be supernovae .",
    "although v838 mon is now suspected to be a stellar merger event @xcite , these two mechanisms have similar end results : a massive hydrogen envelope ejected at low energies .",
    "spectroscopic observations show however that these phenomena have dispersion velocities significantly higher than calculated here .",
    "the observation of further transients may decide this question , or a search for remnants .",
    "the shedding of a common envelope by a binary merger would leave behind a degenerate remnant , but a failed core - collapse explosion would leave a black hole . a survey such as that proposed by @xcite ,",
    "monitoring red supergiants for anomalous transients that might signal the birth of a black hole , should catch these events .",
    "they would be visible as a sudden brightening of the  star \" for of order a year , followed by a gradual but complete disappearance .    in rsg25",
    "a tov limit of 2.2 @xmath25 or lower resulted in such weak outgoing shocks that they could not be accurately followed using kepler , and would probably be unable to eject the envelope . in situations where the envelope is not ejected , there is still the possibility of a transient at late times if the envelope is rotating .",
    "as it falls back into the black hole , the massive envelope may create a disk and potentially a long - duration gamma - ray transient as described by @xcite . since the most massive stars are the ones more likely to produce black holes quickly , it remains possible to produce these long gamma - ray transients .",
    "this type of transient , while invisible in the optical , could emit low levels of gamma rays for months .",
    "a higher tov limit in the neutron star eos will increase the probability of these transients occurring .",
    "holding the tov limit constant , the final strength of the shock is highest in stars with both smaller initial iron core masses ( more time spent as a neutron star ) and smaller carbon - oxygen and helium core masses .",
    "we might therefore expect the strongest transients to come from the lowest - mass red supergiants that fail to form ccsne .",
    "nucleosynthetic constraints place a lower limit on the maximum mass star that must explode as a supernova most of the time .",
    "@xcite sets this limit at between 20 and 25 @xmath25 .",
    "stars above 20 @xmath25 become more difficult to explode , as measured by their compactness parameter @xcite , and hence more likely to fail . at the same time , in stars above 25 @xmath25 , it will become increasingly difficult for the shock to reach the surface .",
    "we may therefore expect the progenitors of these transients , if they do occur , to land in the range 20 - 25 @xmath25 .    for heavier stars that lose their hydrogen envelope and die as wr stars , or for stripped progenitors in binaries , a shock can form and may reach the surface , depending on the size of the remaining helium core . without a large envelope to eject ,",
    "the transient will be brief but brighter .",
    "we have demonstrated that iron core collapse in a massive star is capable of producing a faint observable transient even if the collapse itself creates no prompt outgoing shock .",
    "the mass lost to neutrinos results , in some cases , in unbinding the hydrogen envelope .",
    "the amount and history of the neutrino mass loss has a strong effect on the magnitude of the shock produced , as does the structure of the carbon - oxygen and helium cores of the progenitor star . in the two red supergiant models tested , the shock reached the base of the hydrogen envelope in a majority of the models with enough energy to eject it .",
    "these unusual transients will appear as low - energy , long - duration , red events as the ejected envelope emits its energy via hydrogen recombination .",
    "the ejected envelope has a speed on the order of 50 - 100 km / s and maintains a luminosity @xmath47 ergs / s for approximately a year .    for a given parametrization of the neutrino losses , the transient produced becomes weaker as the tov mass limit is reduced and as the mass of the presupernova helium core increases .",

    "<S> the continuing difficulty of achieving a reliable explosion in simulations of core - collapse supernovae , especially for more massive stars , has led to speculation concerning the observable transients that might be produced if such a supernova fails . even if a prompt outgoing shock fails to form in a collapsing presupernova star </S>",
    "<S> , one must still consider the hydrodynamic response of the star to the abrupt loss of mass via neutrinos as the core forms a protoneutron star . </S>",
    "<S> following a suggestion by @xcite , we calculate the hydrodynamical responses of typical supernova progenitor stars to the rapid loss of approximately 0.2 to 0.5 @xmath0  of gravitational mass from their centers . in a red supergiant star , a very weak supernova with total kinetic energy @xmath1 erg results . the binding energy of a large fraction of the hydrogen envelope before the explosion is of the same order and , depending upon assumptions regarding the neutrino loss rates , most of it is ejected . </S>",
    "<S> ejection speeds are @xmath2 km s@xmath3 and luminosities @xmath4 erg s@xmath3 are maintained for about a year . </S>",
    "<S> a significant part of the energy comes from the recombination of hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the color of the explosion is extremely red and the events bear some similarity to `` luminous red novae , '' but have much lower speeds . </S>"
