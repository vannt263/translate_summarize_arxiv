    "in the past 30 years , infrared observations have revolutionized our understanding of star formation .",
    "iras and iso observations of young stellar objects showed that young stellar objects with disks and infalling protostellar envelopes exhibit distinctive infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in the mid and far - ir .",
    "ground - based surveys of molecular clouds using near - ir detector arrays found that young stars typically form in clusters @xcite .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope promises to further revolutionize the study of star formation by providing the capability to image young stellar groups and clusters in the mid - ir with the sensitivity to detect young stars down to the hydrogen burning limit and below . with this new capability",
    ", we can build upon the legacies of iras , iso and numerous ground - based near - ir observations by probing the seds of stars , brown dwarfs and protostars in young stellar clusters out to distances of 1 kpc or greater .    as part of the guaranteed time observations of the irac instrument team",
    ", we will image 31 young stellar groups and clusters with the mips and irac instruments .",
    "these have been selected from a catalog of 63 star forming regions within 1 kpc of the sun containing 10 or more members @xcite . in parallel",
    ", we are mapping 7 sq .",
    "degrees in the orion molecular clouds .",
    "these surveys will sample the full continuum of multiple star forming regions in the nearest kiloparsec , from small groups of stars in taurus to the rich orion nebula and mon r2 clusters .",
    "this paper reports on initial results for four young stellar clusters in our sample with properties between those of taurus and orion : s140 , s171 , cepheus c and ngc7129 .",
    "these regions are at similar distances , but span a range of fir luminosities , molecular gas masses , and cluster membership ( table  [ properties ] ) . in each cluster",
    ", we use the irac photometry to identify young stars with disks and protostars .",
    "we base our classification on the results of a companion paper by @xcite , in which the irac colors of the observed young stars are compared to colors derived from models of stars with disks or infalling envelopes .",

    "observations of cepheus c , s171 , ngc7129 and s140 were obtained on 2003 december 19 , 23 , and 24 , respectively , with the infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite . each region was mapped in a @xmath9 grid resulting in a @xmath10 field with coverage in all four irac wavelength bands .",
    "the 12 second high dynamic range mode was used to obtain two frames at each position , one with an exposure time of 0.4 seconds and one with an exposure time of 10.4 seconds .",
    "the map was repeated four times with small offsets , resulting in a total integration of 41.6 seconds per pixel after co - adding the longer duration frames .",
    "the observations were processed with the sao irac pipeline ( sip ) and mosaics were created with a custom idl program .",
    "source finding and photometry was performed using gutermuth s photvis 1.08 which incorporates landsman s idlphot package into an interactive gui @xcite . to subtract out a spatially varying nebulosity",
    ", we used an aperture radius of 2 pixels ( @xmath11 ) and a sky annulus extending from 2 pixels ( @xmath11 ) to 6 pixels ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the calibration of the data was performed with in - flight observations of irac standard stars , and aperture corrections were determined for each band from observations of an irac standard star . in this paper",
    ", we consider only sources detected in all four bands .",
    "the standard deviations returned by idlphot includes a contribution of @xmath13 , which is added in quadrature , where @xmath14 is the aperture radius in pixels and @xmath15 is the standard deviation of the pixel values in the sky annulus .",
    "consequently , bright , well detected stars can have large uncertainties if they are coincident with a bright , spatially varying nebulosity .",
    "since regions of active star formation often have bright nebulosity in the 5.8 and 8  @xmath16 m bands , we adopt a maximum photometric uncertainty of 0.25  mag for the 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath16 m data , as compared to 0.2  mag for the 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath16 m data .",
    "we include only stars brighter than 14  mag at 5.8  @xmath16 m and 13  mag at 8.0  @xmath16 m ; at these magnitudes the typical uncertainties are 0.2  mag or less .",
    "the resulting median uncertainties are 0.01 , 0.01 , 0.04 and 0.06  mag , and only 3% of the stars in our sample have uncertainties greater than 0.2  mag in the 5.8  @xmath16 m and/or 8.0  @xmath16 m bands . each image was visually inspected , and nebulous knots misidentified as stars and close double stars were rejected .",
    "in an analysis of iras photometry of young stellar objects in nearby dark clouds , classified young stellar objects as class i , ii and iii by the slope of their seds . the classification scheme was placed in an evolutionary context by @xcite , who modeled the seds as stars surrounded by dusty disks and envelopes . by comparing these models to the observed seds , they identified class  i objects as protostars with infalling envelopes and class  ii objects as stars with disks .",
    "class  iii objects have the seds of stellar photospheres .",
    "the three classes are thought to form an evolutionary sequence , with young stars evolving from class  i to class  ii and finally to class  iii objects @xcite .    instead of performing an analysis directly on the infrared seds , we use the colors derived from the four irac bands to classify each young star .",
    "figure  [ color ] shows that the @xmath17-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath18-[8.0]$ ] colors extend over 2  magnitudes .",
    "we display two reddening vectors derived from the extinction law of @xcite and from the optical constants of @xcite .",
    "we have applied these two extinction laws to three different sources : a model of vega @xcite , a star with disks taken from an ensemble of models by @xcite , and an idealized flat spectrum source with @xmath19 . since the irac 8  @xmath16 m band overlaps the silicate feature",
    ", reddened photospheres would appear increasingly blue in the @xmath18-[8.0]$ ] color ; the slope of the reddening vector depends on the extinction law , the intrinsic spectrum of the source , and the amount of extinction .    centered at @xmath20-[4.5],[5.8]-[8.0])=(0,0)$ ]",
    "are the sources with the colors of stellar photospheres .",
    "this region of the color plane may include foreground and background stars as well as diskless ( class iii ) pre - main sequence stars .",
    "the distribution of sources appears elongated in the vertical direction ; this is due to a combination of reddening and the blue @xmath17-[4.5]$ ] colors of background giants with strong co absorption in the 4.5  @xmath16 m band . in all four clusters",
    "there is a concentration of sources centered near @xmath20-[4.5],[5.8]-[8.0])=(0.7,0.5)$ ] , which we outline with a box in figure  [ color ] .",
    "these colors can be reproduced by models of disks around young , low - mass stars @xcite .",

    "these sources are in regions with bright , structured 8  @xmath16 m nebulosity , and these may be class  ii sources in which compact knots and filaments of nebulosity are contributing to the signal in the 8  @xmath16 m band .",
    "there are several factors that may lead to the incorrect classification of sources .",
    "first , models show some overlap between class  i sources and class  ii sources in the irac color plane @xcite .",
    "we classify the sources in this overlap region as class  ii .",
    "second , photometric scatter may alter the classification of a few sources .",
    "third , some of the sources which we have identified as class  i objects may be in fact reddened class  ii objects .",
    "finally , unresolved binaries can result in the incorrect classification of sources .",
    "the herbig be star lkh@xmath24234 in ngc 7129 is wrongly identified as a class  i object in the irac color plane ; this misclassification is due to a protostellar companion which is detected in ground - based mid - ir observations but is unresolved by irac @xcite . background planetary nebulae , agb stars , and galaxies may also be misidentified as young stars or protostars @xcite ; however , the spatial distribution of sources discussed in the following section indicates that the amount of background contamination is small .    by combining mips 24  @xmath16 m photometry with the irac photometry of ngc 7129 , @xcite",

    "this data provides an independent check of our classification using the irac color plane .",
    "for the twenty four sources common to both samples ( muzerolle et al . required detection in _ three _ irac bands _ and _ the mips 24  @xmath16 m band ) , the classification by @xcite is almost entirely consistent with ours ( see ngc7129 plot in fig  [ color ] ) .",

    ", @xcite mapped each of these regions in the @xmath30co and c@xmath31o ( @xmath32 ) transition .",
    "we overlay contours of the the c@xmath31o emission which is an excellent tracer of the structure of the molecular gas in star forming regions @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the emission from the more abundant @xmath30co molecule is stronger and more extended , but has a higher optical depth and is less sensitive to the detailed structure in the gas @xcite .",
    "we find 72% of the class i and 56% of the class ii sources fall within the detected c@xmath31o emission , and 93% of the class  i and 86% of the class  ii sources fall within the detected @xmath30co emission .",
    "these percentages are qualitatively consistent with the class  i sources being younger than the class  ii sources .",
    "the cepheus c cluster was first identified in a near - ir survey by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the near - ir cluster , which is located toward the center of figure  [ imagea ] , the irac data show class  i and ii sources distributed over a 3 pc diameter region . the molecular gas traced by the c@xmath31o is visible in the irac images as filamentary dark clouds obscuring a diffuse nebulosity extending across the entire mosaic .",
    "two class  i objects appear outside the c@xmath31o emission ; @xmath30co emission is found toward both of these sources .    the s171 cluster is a compact cluster of young stars found in a bright - rimmed cloud .",
    "the ob stars of the cepheus iv association , which illuminate the bright rim , are outside the image and to the south .",
    "the funnel shaped surface of the cloud emits strongly in the irac 5.8 and 8.0  @xmath16 m bands and is clearly seen in figure  [ imagea ] ; the @xmath30co map shows the molecular gas extending to the edge of the funnel .",
    "s171 contains a cluster of young stars near the edge of the cloud ; with a dense group of 5 class  i sources at northern apex of the cluster .",
    "this morphology suggests that star formation is being triggered by a photoevaporation driven shock - wave propagating into the cloud , as first proposed for this region by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the stars in the cluster , there are 6 class  ii and 2 class  i objects spread throughout the molecular cloud .",
    "the presence of these stars suggests that a distributed mode of star formation is also occurring in the cloud .",
    "s140 is also a bright - rimmed cloud and the one region of massive star formation in our sample ; as in case of s171 , the illuminated surface is clearly delineated in figure  [ imageb ] .",
    "a group of at least three early b stars are thought to have recently formed in this region @xcite ; these three sources are saturated in our data and appear as a bright extended source near the center of the image .",
    "the bright emission from the central stars and the extended nebulosity make the detection of sources in all four bands difficult .",
    "we identify three class  i and three class  ii objects within a 0.5  pc radius of the young massive stars ; a near - ir star counts analysis reveals 34 members within this radius ( table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "extending east into the molecular clouds is a filamentary dark cloud seen in absorption against the diffuse emission ; in these filaments are five class  i sources , and three class  ii sources . near the eastern edge of the map",
    "are two additional class  i objects which appear outside the contours of the c@xmath31o map ; however , @xmath30co emission is detected toward these sources @xcite . to the southwest of the cluster and outside the bright rimmed cloud are 9 class  ii objects , a class  i object , and a class  i / ii object .",
    "these may be young stars which emerged into the hii region when their natal molecular gas was overtaken by the advancing ionization front .",
    "near - ir observations show that ngc  7129 contains a cluster of over 80 young stars .",
    "many of these stars are coincident with a bright reflection nebula and can not be detected in all four irac bands ; hence the dense clustering of sources found in the near - ir is not apparent in figure  [ imageb ] .",
    "the molecular cloud , as delineated by the c@xmath31o contours , wraps around the reflection nebula @xcite ; the distribution of class  i and ii sources in figure  [ imageb ] shows that star formation is ongoing in this cloud .",
    "there are eight class  i objects outside the contours of the c@xmath31o emission .",
    "emission in @xmath30co is detected toward all but three of these sources : the northernmost class  i object is outside the @xmath30co map and no molecular gas is detected toward the two class  i objects west of the reflection nebula . @xcite and @xcite",
    "discuss irac and mips observations of ngc  7129 in more detail .",
    "in all four clusters , the young stars and protostars identified by their excess emission in the mid - ir are distributed over multi - parsec distances . in contrast , the diameters of the clusters identified by near - ir star counts are typically 1 pc or less @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a significant fraction of stars in each star forming region form outside the dense clustered regions identified in star counts analyses .",
    "@xcite find that half of the stars in ngc 7129 are located in a halo outside the cluster core .",
    "furthermore , star formation in ngc  7129 is continuing in the halo , while the molecular gas has been dispersed toward the cluster core .",
    "the distribution of sources in each region is strikingly different . in cepheus c ,",
    "the structure of the molecular cloud breaks up into distinct mid - ir dark cores , and several distinct concentrations of stars are also apparent to the eye .",
    "the observed distribution of gas and stars in this region is similar to the hierarchical morphologies generated in numerical models of star formation in turbulent clouds @xcite .",
    "irac images of ngc  7129 show a dense cluster of primarily class  ii sources surrounded by a more extended halo of class i and ii objects . both s171 and",
    "s140 contain compact clusters at the edges of bright - rimmed clouds .",
    "these varied mophologies hint that environmental factors , such as the presence of external ob stars , may play a significant role in the formation of clusters .",
