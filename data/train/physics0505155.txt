    "one of the main feature of homogeneous and isotropic fully developed turbulence , corresponding to very large reynolds numbers , is the fact that statistical properties at small scales are scaling and universal @xcite , and possess intermittent fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this is classically characterized using structure functions scaling exponents , describing the probability density of velocity fluctuations at all scales belonging to the inertial range @xcite .",
    "this concerns the eulerian velocity and its statistics , but the characteristic features of fully developed turbulence is not only intermittency and multiple scales , it is also the loss of predictability , chaotic behaviour , dispersion and mixing properties , and a large number of degrees of freedom . in the last ten years , many of these properties have been revisited taking into account intermittency to consider how different scaling laws related to these issues are modified ( for a review of several results in this framework see @xcite ) .",
    "the scaling exponents obtained have often been expressed as a legendre transform of some function of velocity exponents , and numerical applications need a numerical legendre transform involving the dimension function of velocity fluctuations . here",
    "we present a simple method to simplify legendre transform expressions and to replace them with parametric functions that provide explicitely the scaling exponents when the eulerian velocity scaling exponent structure functions are known . in the following the general framework is presented in section [ sec2 ] and applied to different applications from predictability to @xmath0-entropy studies in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "let us note that the results presented here correspond to the ideal situation of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence ; for realistic flows , this property can not be expected to hold perfectly since the influence of boundary conditions may introduce statistical inhomogeneity .",
    "we recall first here the multifractal framework for velocity intermittency in turbulence , classically characterized using statistical moments of velocity increments .",
    "we recall the legendre transform introduced to relate scaling moment function to the codimension function of velocity singularities .",
    "the latter is subsequently systematically used to simplify the legendre transform of some general expression of the codimension function .      in fully developed turbulence",
    ", intermittency is classically characterized by @xmath1 , the scaling exponent of spatial structure functions . denoting @xmath2 the increments of the velocity field at a spatial scale @xmath3 ,",
    "their fluctuations are characterized , in the inertial range , using the scale invariant moment function @xmath1 ( see @xcite for reviews ) : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the order of moment .",
    "kolmogorov s initial proposal @xcite , for a non - intermittent constant dissipation , leads to @xmath6 . for intermittent turbulence",
    ", @xmath1 is a cumulant generating function , and is nonlinear and concave ; only the third moment has no intermittency correction : @xmath7 ( see below ) . on the other hand , taking into account intermittency for the eulerian velocity , one can write locally : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a singularity of the velocity fluctuations .",
    "there is a continuous range of possible @xmath9 values , and they are characterized through their codimension function @xmath10 defined as @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the probability density of velocity fluctuations at scale @xmath3 . here",
    "the codimension is used for convenience , instead of the more classical dimension @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the dimension of the space ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 in most studies ) , and @xmath12 is the probability density of velocity fluctuations .",
    "let us note that , while @xmath9 can be both negative or positive ( but it is most of the time positive ) , the codimension function @xmath10 is positive and decreasing .",
    "this continuous range of @xmath9 values justified the use of the term `` multifractal '' for such process @xcite .",
    "the moments write : @xmath17 using a saddle point argument @xcite , this gives the classical legendre transform , between @xmath18 and the codimension function : @xmath19 this can also be written in the following way , emphasizing the one - to - one relation between orders of moment @xmath5 and singularities @xmath9 : @xmath20 the last relation can be replaced by @xmath21 .",
    "equations ( [ eq5 ] ) are used below .",
    "the scaling moment function @xmath1 is proportional to the cumulant generating function of the variable @xmath22 ; it is nonlinear and concave .",
    "there are two `` fixed points '' for this curve , corresponding to a piori exact values : @xmath23 and @xmath7 .",
    "the latter relation is a consequence of the kolmogorov @xmath24 law @xcite for the third order longitudinal structure function ( without absolute values ) : @xmath25 the other moments do not have well - accepted theoretical values ; the analytical curves depend on the stochastic model chosen for the statistics of velocity fluctuations . in agreement with kolmogorov s initial hypothesis concerning the universality of velocity fluctuations in the inertial range ,",
    "experimental estimates are rather stable for small and medium orders of moments and do not depend on the reynolds number : the exponents @xmath18 have been estimated experimentally for more than twenty years , for different types of flows ( see @xcite ) , and are now considered as rather stable and almost universal until moments of order @xmath26 or @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "let us note that the moment of order @xmath26 seems to be close to @xmath28 , for any reasons that did not receive up to now any theoretical founding .    since these estimates are rather stable up to moments of order 8 , we chose in the following for simplicity for @xmath18 average values of the estimates published in ref .",
    "@xcite : see table [ tab1 ] .",
    "these are estimates obtained from many experiments with @xmath29 going from 35 to 5 000 .",
    "the experimental average which is used here is quite close to all these experimental estimates .",
    "let us first consider the predictability property of small perturbations in turbulence .",
    "it is well - known that the viscous cutoff , corresponding to the scale for which the reynolds number is of order 1 , is different from the kolmogorov scale @xmath30 when intermittency is taken into account : more intense singularities have a smaller local cutoff scale and weak fluctuations have larger cutoff scales .",
    "this range of scales is the intermediate dissipation range , where there is a mixture of inertial and dissipation effects . using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and the reynolds number @xmath31 , this writes @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a large scale and @xmath34 is the cutoff scale associated to singularity @xmath9 .",

    "this temporal cutoff scale is the smallest scale of the system : below these scales viscosity dominates . in fully developed turbulence",
    ", the positive maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath40 , characterizing the exponential growth rate of an infinitesimal disturbance , is proportional to the inverse of the smallest characteristic time of the system . since there is a range of time scales associated to the continuous range of @xmath9 values through eq.([eq8 ] ) , the lyapunov exponent may be given by @xcite : @xmath41 giving finally : @xmath42 with the exponent @xmath43 given by a saddle - point argument since the reynolds number is large @xcite : @xmath44 this was solved numerically by crisanti et al .",
    "@xcite to provide @xmath45 through a numerical legendre transform using experimental estimates of the function @xmath10 .",
    "this result is slightly smaller than the one provided by ruelle @xcite for nonintermittent turbulence : @xmath46 .",
    "let us go further and show here how to obtain this exponent , considering , for more generality , the moments of order @xmath47 of the inverse times : @xmath48 where , using as done above a saddle - point argument , the exponents @xmath49 are given by : @xmath50 in general , the singularity @xmath51 for which this condition is met verifies @xmath52 where @xmath53 estimating the derivative @xmath52 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) to introduce the moment @xmath54 associated to the singularity @xmath51 leads to : @xmath55 this provides a unique value of @xmath54 and hence of @xmath51 , for a given value of @xmath5 .",
    "this equation , together with another use of the legendre transform , gives the function @xmath56 : @xmath57 this gives finally the following parametric relation between @xmath49 and the moment function @xmath1 : @xmath58 the nonintermittent curve obtained for @xmath6 is @xmath59 .",
    "the explicit parametric relation ( [ eq16 ] ) can be used to represent the curve @xmath49 for experimental estimates of @xmath1 : this is shown in fig .",

    "one can see from fig .",
    "1 that up to moments of order @xmath60 the linear non - intermittent curve is a very good approximation . the value of @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath62 ( close to @xmath63 ) but the intermittent correction is very small .",

    "obtains @xmath68 since @xmath7 , and hence @xmath69 is a fixed point , non affected by intermittency , recovering a result already given in ref .",
    "one can also obtain the following estimates : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( coming from @xmath73 ) , and @xmath74 .",
    "the same approach can be used to express scaling exponents characterizing time scale statistics associated to noninfinitesimal perturbations . as proposed in ref . @xcite and developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and using the notations of the latter reference , we consider a perturbation of size @xmath75 of the velocity field , for @xmath75 belonging to the inertial range ( hence the term noninfinitesimal ) . the time scale associated to the eddy of typical velocity @xmath75",
    "can also be considered as the decorrelation time associated to the perturbation . in this framework ,",
    "the inverse time is @xmath76 and since using the singularity @xmath9 , one has @xmath77 , we obtain locally the relation between the time scale and the perturbation @xmath75 : @xmath78 as before , this can be used to consider the moments of order @xmath47 of the inverse times , but here we will consider their scaling property as a power - law function of the velocity perturbation @xmath75 . using the same type of argument as above , the moments of the inverse time are expressed as an integral over all singularities @xmath9 an we consider all functions as power - law functions of @xmath75 so that using a saddle - point argument , one has a scaling law : @xmath79 where the exponents @xmath80 are given by the following relation ( using the fact that the probability density writes @xmath81 ) : @xmath82 where the negative sign has been introduced for convenience to have positive final numerical values for @xmath80 ( see below ) . as done above for infinitesimal perturbations ,",
    "this can be expressed explicitely introducing the singularity @xmath51 that maximises the expression into brackets . with the same procedure as above : involving a differenciation and the introduction of the moment of order @xmath54 associated to @xmath51 , we obtain the final result as a parametric relation between @xmath80 and @xmath1 : @xmath83 the exponent @xmath80 is simply linked to the reciprocal of @xmath84 , denoted @xmath85 .",
    "the nonintermittent curve obtained for @xmath6 is @xmath86 . using eq.([eq20 ] ) we can see that @xmath7 gives @xmath87 , which is a fixed point for @xmath80 , non affected by intermittency corrections @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting function compared to the straight line of equation @xmath88 .",
    "it is visible that @xmath80 grows very fast .",
    "indeed , the relation @xmath73 gives the value @xmath89 .",
    "we can see that for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and for @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the result @xmath87 was checked using shell - model simulations @xcite .",
    "as an analogy with kolmogorov s dimensional analysis in the eulerian framework , landau @xcite proposed in 1944 a @xmath62 law for the temporal increments of the lagrangian velocity @xmath94 .",
    "this was later generalized by novikov , with a lagrangian intermittency framework for the velocity @xcite : @xmath95 as for the eulerian case , for a constant dissipation one obtains the `` mean field '' expression , neglecting intermittency : @xmath96 . in this framework , the third order moment for the eulerian velocity is analogous to the second order moment for the lagrangian velocity : in case of intermittency @xmath97 is nonlinear and concave , and the non - intermittent function is valid only for @xmath67 : @xmath98 .",
    "recently some authors have proposed an hypothesis helping to relate eulerian and lagrangian structure functions @xcite , following an earlier proposal by borgas @xcite .",
    "they consider the velocity advecting lagrangian trajectories as a superposition of different velocity contributions coming from different eddies having different characteristic times . after a time @xmath99 the fastest eddies , of scale smaller than @xmath3 ,",
    "are decorrelated so that at leading order , they assume @xcite : @xmath100 writing @xmath101 and using @xmath102 , gives the time and space local correspondence @xmath103 . introducing this relation inside the integral of eq.([eq5 ] ) , one obtains for the moments of the eulerian velocity increments : @xmath104 using a saddle point argument and using eqs.([eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) , this gives the lagrangian structure function as a legendre transform @xcite : @xmath105 the authors that explored this relation did not go further to express @xmath97 in the general case @xcite .",
    "in fact , as we showed elsewhere for a lagrangian turbulence study @xcite , using an approach analogous to the ones above , one can obtain an explicit relation between eulerian and lagrangian structure functions scaling exponents .",
    "we introduce the singularity @xmath51 that maximises the expression into brackets , and with the same procedure involving a differenciation and the introduction of the moment of order @xmath54 associated to @xmath51 we obtain the final result ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath106 this relation provides @xmath97 when the fonction @xmath18 is known , the second lign giving the link between @xmath5 and @xmath54 .",
    "we can check that for @xmath68 , the second line gives @xmath67 and the first one , @xmath107 .",
    "we can also consider the case @xmath108 and using @xmath109 , the approximate result @xmath110 .",
    "let us note that an analogous expression is provided in @xcite for singularities and ( with our notations ) codimension functions @xmath10 in his appendix a ( equation ( a 4 ) ) .",
    "borgas used for this other types of arguments , including a reynolds number scaling expression for eulerian and lagragian statistics ; however , he did not go to the moment framework to provide an equivalent expression for structure functions scaling exponents .",
    "let us also note that some comparisons are performed in @xcite between their shell model lagrangian values and eulerian shell model estimates , transformed through a numerical legendre transform using the analytical expression of a fit of @xmath10 .",
    "the same type of comparison is performed in @xcite between their dns estimates and a numerical legendre transform of eulerian values .",
    "the approach proposed here is more direct since we test an explicit parametric relation corresponding to different hypothesis .",
    "the euler - lagrange relation given here is non - linear , so that one can not expect to obtain the same type of statistical models in eulerian and lagrangian frameworks .",
    "for example , as explained by chevillard @xcite using borgas relation , in this framework , the statistics can not be lognormal for both eulerian and lagrangian velocity fields .",
    "indeed , for @xmath111 with @xmath112 and @xmath113 , one obtains @xmath114 . for more details",
    "see our paper @xcite where different proposals for the lagrangian structure functions scaling exponents are tested .    in figure 3 ,",
    "the lagrangian prediciton is compared to lagrangian estimates published in recent papers @xcite .",
    "these papers report different types of such estimates : ref .",
    "@xcite gives the values of experimental estimates for four flows going from @xmath29 of 510 to 1 000 , and direct numerical simulations ( dns ) estimates for @xmath29=75 and 140 .",
    "@xcite reports shell model estimates and ref .",
    "@xcite dns corresponding to @xmath29=280 .",
    "in order not to have a too heavy figure , we plotted in figure 3 four different types of lagrangian values : an average value of the 4 experiments shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dns simulation corresponding to @xmath29=140 of the same publication , the shell model estimates of ref .",
    "@xcite and the dns estimate of ref .",
    "the average eulerian curve is transformed and compared to these four lagragian estimates .",
    "several comments can be proposed from figure 3 .",
    "first , let us note that these experimental and numerical estimations for eulerian and lagrangian scaling exponents come from different types of flows with different reynolds numbers . for eulerian estimates ,",
    "the exponents have been carefully compared and are now considered as rather stables up to moments of order 8 , but for lagrangian estimates , this work is still to do ; measurements are only available for a few years , and the scaling ranges are still small , so that the range of variability for these exponents is expected to narrow in the future . indeed , as for the eulerian case",
    ", one can expect that for high reynolds numbers these exponents are rather stable and universal , up to a given order of moment that may be smaller than the eulerian case , for which this critical order of moments is about 7 - 8 .    with these comments in mind , we can provide some preliminary conclusions from the observation of figure 3 : ( i ) up to moment of order 3 ,",
    "the prediction are close to all lagrangian data ; ( ii ) for larger moments , there is too much scatter in the estimates to conclude about the validity of the transformation given by eq.([eq25 ] ) .",
    "a possible explanation of such scatter is the fact that scaling can be strongly affected by trapping in vortex filaments @xcite . in this case , after a filtering of high frequencies , the data may be closer to the multifractal prediction .",
    "we next consider the influence of intermittency on relative dispersion : this deals with the statistics of particle pair dispersion , advected by an intermittent eulerian velocity field .",
    "this topic is close to the lagrangian case .",
    "let us consider @xmath115 , the distance between a pair of particles advected by an intermittent turbulence .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , one can introduce @xmath116 , the velocity difference along the lagrangian trajectories .",
    "this can be written : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the increment of the lagrangian velocity is evaluated for a distance @xmath119 associated to a time scale @xmath120 . then using the same hypothesis as for the lagrangian case ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) and ( [ eq22 ] ) ) , we obtain the time evolution of the moments of the pair distance : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the scaling exponent characterizing the intermittent pair dispersion . using eq.([eq24 ] )",
    "the exponents @xmath122 can be given as a legendre transform of the eulerian velocity , as provided by boffetta et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath123 in fact eq.([eq27 ] ) shows also directly that the dispersion exponent is simply related to the lagrangian velocity exponent : @xmath124 equations ( [ eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) then give : @xmath125 this can also be written @xmath126 .",
    "this relation could also have been obtained from eq.([eq28 ] ) using the same approach as above .",
    "with @xmath68 we obtain @xmath67 and @xmath127 , corresponding to richardson s law @xmath128 @xcite , which is thus a fixed point for which there is no intermittency correction , as already noticed @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 , we represent the transform ( [ eq30 ] ) compared to the non - intermittent line of equation @xmath129 , compared also to the shell model estimates published in ref . @xcite .",
    "this shows that the nonlinearity of @xmath122 does not seem very strong .",
    "furthermore , @xmath130 is concave , and the values give by eq .",
    "( [ eq30 ] ) are quite close to the ones reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we finally consider exit - time moments @xcite , also called inverse structure functions @xcite .",
    "we consider a time series of a turbulent quantity @xmath131 having intermittent fluctuations characterized by singularities @xmath9 such as @xmath132 with codimension @xmath10 : @xmath133 . the moments are assumed to scale as @xmath134 with eq.([eq7 ] ) .",
    "one then studies the dynamics of such signal by considering exit times ( also called distance structure functions or inverse turbulence functions ) : considering a threshold value @xmath135 , let us denote @xmath136 the first time needed to obtain an increment @xmath135 . a new time",
    "series @xmath137 can be obtained this way , whose statistics will scale as the threshold value @xmath75 : @xmath138 where @xmath139 can be obtained , as before , as a legendre transform involving @xmath10 . writing @xmath140 and inserting this into the integral of the moment estimation gives @xcite : @xmath141 here as before , we estimate this function explicitely .",
    "a derivative of @xmath142 leads to @xmath143 with @xmath144 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath145 the result then writes simply : @xmath146 which is exactly a result given in ref .",
    "@xcite based on an exact result for a special case ( a multifractal cantor set ) , and experimentally verified using shell model turbulence simulations , but with no formal proof of the formulae in the general case . a similar expression obtained in the very different context of laplacian random walk",
    "is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we must note here , as already noticed in @xcite , that eq.([eq33 ] ) involves for either the original series or for the return time series , negative moments .",
    "let us consider first positive moments of return times : @xmath47 in eq.([eq31 ] ) .",
    "we need here the hypothesis of the existence of negative moments of the velocity structure functions , but it may not be the case , since this needs in practice extremely precise measurements .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that negative moments for @xmath147 do not exist since the pdf of velocity increments does not vanish at @xmath148 .",
    "the derivative writes @xmath149 . for @xmath47 ,",
    "if negative moments @xmath54 such that @xmath150 are not accessible in the experimental time series , then the derivative stays strictly negative , @xmath151 does not reach a relative minimum , and the minimal value selected by eq.([eq32 ] ) will be obtained for the maximal value of @xmath9 , which is a `` minimal '' singularity of the velocity fluctuations , and hence denoted here @xmath152 : @xmath153 .",
    "since this value of @xmath9 is the same for all @xmath5 s , the result is a linear behaviour : @xmath154 the singularity @xmath152 is associated to small moments and the smallest fluctuations detectable in experimental time series ; it is not clear whether this maximum singularity reaches a fixed value for eulerian turbulence , and what is this value .",
    "this maximal singularity also depends on the precision of the experimental measurements which are analyzed . to check this , we consider numerical and experimental analysis of such inverse statistics for @xmath47 .",
