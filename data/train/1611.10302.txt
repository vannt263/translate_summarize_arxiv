    "network coding ( nc ) @xcite is one of the most promising techniques to improve throughput in complex networks . in particular , it has been shown that nc can substantially improve network throughput and/or transmission delay over multicast networks .",
    "most existing studies in multicast networks assume saturated transmitter queue that guarantees packet availability for transmission @xcite , where the queue length is considered to be infinite . in this paper ,",
    "realistic bounded queue is applied . for wireless networks , @xcite and @xcite",
    "considered multi - hop and multi - source transmissions to find the maximum stable throughput .",
    "furthermore , a stability policy is provided in @xcite for a network coded unicast network . in delay",
    "sensitive applications , @xcite proposed a buffer - aware network coding method to reduce the delay caused by random packet arrivals . additionally , stability properties are also evaluated in @xcite for broadcast / multicast erasure channels with nc , where the authors proposed a suboptimal virtual queue structure and provide detailed analysis for the case of two receivers . however , there is no closed form analysis for stability conditions and the proposed queueing model is quite complicated when the number of receivers is greater than two . in @xcite",
    "the authors analyzed the performance of a simple two - user broadcast channel in terms of stable throughput region .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite proposed a wireless multicast virtual queue model for the special case of two receivers , where the transmitter has one sub - queue for each receiver .",
    "however , for wireless fading channels with a large number of receivers , it is likely that a packet fails at more than two receivers .",
    "along the same line , an upper bound of the maximum input rate for a stable multicast system is derived in @xcite for the case of three users . in @xcite",
    "there is only one unique sub - queue , which stores those transmitted packets that are successfully received by at least one but not all receivers .",
    "note that each packet in the sub - queue is associated with an _ index set _ consisting of the receivers who have not received this packet ; then the packets with disjoint index sets are combined and sent to all target receivers .",
    "finally , in @xcite linear programming with queueing stability constraints is used to obtain the optimal network coding scheduling policy . however , this solution is not scalable for a large number of users due to the prohibitive computational complexity .    in this paper ,",
    "the queue structure is the same as @xcite .",
    "however instead of selecting network coding scheduling schemes based on the probabilities resulted from the solution of a linear programming as it is presented in @xcite , in this work with the aid of _ lyapunov optimization model _ , the scheduling schemes are chosen based on the minimization of a _ decision function_. further , we expand our work by considering time - critical data where each packet expires after a predefined deadline and is then considered useless for any receiver and consequently dropped from the system .",
    "however , for packets with hard deadlines queue stability is trivial and irrelevant since expired packets are dropped in any case .",
    "specifically , our main contributions are summarized as follows :    * based on network coding and lyapunov optimization model , we propose new low - complexity multicast scheduling algorithm that not only meets the queue stability constraint but also minimizes the queue size . * to minimize the number of dropped packets resulted from hard deadline , we further derive a scheduling policy that simultaneously minimizes both dropped packets and queue size .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is presented in section ii .",
    "a lyapunov based scheduling along with stability analysis are provided in section iii followed by the modified analysis for time - critical data in section iv . in section",
    "v , the performance of the proposed scheduling is validated through simulation .",
    "finally , a conclusion is drawn in section vi .",
    "we consider a one - hop wireless multicast system in which one transmitter multicasts data packets to @xmath0 users over erasure channels .",
    "the packets are delivered to the source for transmission over erasure channels according to a stationary process with arrival rate @xmath1 .",
    "we consider random and unreliable multicast channels where each packet transmission fails at receivers independently with packet error rate @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , i.e. , the packet is received successfully by receiver @xmath4 with probability @xmath5 .",
    "we assume the system is time slotted . at the beginning of every time slot",
    ", each receiver sends a one bit feedback to the transmitter indicating whether the previously sent packet has been successfully received or not .",
    "a queue is considered stable if the arrival rate is less than the service rate . for queue stability analysis",
    ", we consider stationary operation when the queue distribution reaches a steady state .",
    "let @xmath6 be the service rate of the source queue , the stability condition is given by @xmath7 .",
    "further , for a time - critical system it is assumed that each packet is associated with a packet delivery deadline after which the packet is considered useless .    in this paper",
    "we explore network coding based multicast scheduling schemes .",
    "we adopt the same queuing model as in @xcite , but the scheduling policy is totally different from that of @xcite . specifically , the queue system at the transmitter consists of @xmath8 sub - queues with @xmath9 .",
    "each sub - queue @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is associated with a unique user index set @xmath12 , indicating its intended users ( i.e. , all users that are still expecting packets from @xmath10 ) .",
    "note that all the newly arrived packets are first stored in @xmath13 whose user index set is @xmath14 . in each time slot , according to certain network coding scheme , packets from some different sub - queues ( i.e. , nc participating packets ) are combined into a network coded packet and transmitted .",
    "it is worth noting that , to simultaneously minimize the queue size and benefit the maximum number of users , the index sets of the selected sub - queues are disjoint and their union forms a complete user set . after each transmission , based on the receiver feedback",
    ", a participating packet may : ( 1 ) stay in the same sub - queue if none of its intended users received the network coded packet ; or ( 2 ) leaves the queue system if all of its intended users received the network coded packet ; or ( 3 ) moves to another sub - queue whose user index set matches the participating packet s new intended users .",
    "the queue structure for the case of three receivers is provided in table 1 with five network coding scheduling schemes .",
    "for example , @xmath15 means to transmit the head - of - line packet from @xmath13 ; @xmath16 means to combines the head - of - line packets from @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 for transmission .",
    "accordingly , fig . 1 illustrates the _ data - flow _",
    "model @xcite , where packets enter @xmath20 by rate @xmath1 and eventually are received by all users and leave the queueing system .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         our first objective is to find the optimal network coding scheduling scheme to keep the queue system stable . to solve this problem , @xcite proposed linear programming based scheduling method ( lps ) and derived the following capacity region @xmath21    however , the lps approach is not suitable for dynamic fading channels , where the packet error rates vary from time slot to time slot so that the linear programming problem must be solved at the beginning of every time slot . to reduce the computational complexity , in this paper",
    "we apply _ lyapunov optimization model _ by defining decision variables ( dv ) and derive new scheduling scheme that keeps the system _ strongly stable_. note that a _ strongly stable _ queueing system is defined in @xcite as follows : _ definition 1 : _ a discrete time process @xmath22 is _ strongly stable _",
