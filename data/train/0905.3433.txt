    "it has been observed in central au+au collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) that the yield of neutral pions at high transverse momentum ( @xmath2@xmath35  gev/@xmath4 ) is strongly suppressed compared to the one expected from p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions .",
    "this suppression is considered to be due to the energy lost by hard scattered partons in the medium ( jet quenching ) , which results in a decrease of the yield at a given @xmath2 .",
    "many theoretical models have been proposed to understand the parton energy loss mechanism .",
    "for one thing , glv method@xcite as one of the calculations predicts that the magnitude of energy loss is proportional to the path length if the medium has static density .",
    "studying the path length dependence of energy loss should help the understanding of energy loss process .",
    "recently theoretical models ( asw@xcite , ht@xcite and amy@xcite ) to describe parton energy loss mechanism which involve the time - evolution of the medium produced at rhic have been proposed .",
