    "the origin of the t tauri star tw hya has long been a mystery to astronomers as it is far from any known progenitor cloud . excepting its isolation , rucinski & krautter ( 1983 ) noted that tw hya has all the characteristics of a `` classical '' t tauri star .",
    "subsequent searches by de la reza et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "( 1992 ) at iras point - source catalog positions revealed four other t tauri systems in the same region of the sky and suggested the stars might be associated .",
    "strong x - ray fluxes seen at all five of these systems led kastner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to conclude that the group does indeed form a physical association ( which they dubbed the `` tw hya association '' , hereafter twa ) , at a distance of only @xmath0 50 pc and an age @xmath0 20 myr .",
    "it is remarkable that the closest known region of recent star formation is only now being identified and cataloged .    the strength of the x - ray emission tabulated by kastner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that we might find additional twa members at positions of x - ray bright stars .",
    "we selected sources from the rosat all - sky survey within 12@xmath1 of the approximate cluster center ( 11@xmath4 15@xmath5 , -33@xmath1 ) and cross - correlated their positions with stars in the hubble guide star & usno a1.0 catalogs . since this search region passed close to another young , nearby star , hr 4796 ( jura et al .",
    "1998 ; stauffer et al . 1995 ) , we enlarged our search area to include an overlapping region of radius 8@xmath1 centered on hr 4796 ( 12@xmath4 35@xmath5 , -40@xmath1 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we consider hr 4796 a & b as twa members ( see section 3 ) .",
    "our candidates were prioritized using x - ray flux , x - ray hardness ratios and proper motion .",
    "results discussed below indicate that our search criteria were appropriate , we discovered five t tauri systems containing a total of seven stars ; all are likely twa members .",
    "in addition , we found a @xmath020 jupiter mass probable companion to cod -33@xmath17795 ( twa 5 ) , a previously known twa member .",
    "we used the southern proper motion ( spm ) program plates ( platais et al . 1995 ; girard et al .",
    "1998 ) to derive proper motions of potential twa members .",
    "the spm plates contain multiple images of bright stars in the twa region , with a mean epoch difference ranging from 20 to 25 years .",
    "several of the brighter , previously known twa members were measured and reduced using the standard spm reduction procedure ( e.g. girard et al . 1998 ) which gives absolute proper motions accurate to about 2 - 5 mas yr@xmath6 depending upon the star s magnitude . for the remainder of candidates we used a simplified plate calibration to derive the proper motions with an accuracy of about 5 - 8 mas yr@xmath6 .    on 1998 feb . 6 - 7 ( ut ) we obtained spectra from @xmath06350  to 7735  of approximately 50 candidate stars with the lris spectrometer ( oke et al . 1995 ) on the w. m. keck ii telescope .",
    "the 07 slit yielded a measured resolution of @xmath01.8 .",
    "spectra were extracted and calibrated using iraf .",
    "seven stars , including the individual components of two double systems , show h@xmath7 emission and strong li absorption , characteristics of t tauri stars .",
    "we also obtained lris i - band images of the fields surrounding several twa stars .",
    "speckle observations at the nasa irtf 3 m telescope were conducted 1998 feb .",
    "18 - 20 ( ut ) at 2.2 @xmath8 m to search for close companions to the newly discovered systems as well as four of the original twa members and hr 4796b .",
    "these diffraction - limited observations resolved the known binary stars hen 600 ( sep = @xmath9 , pa = @xmath10 ) and cod -29@xmath1 8887 ( sep = @xmath11 , pa = @xmath12 ) .",
    "one new object was discovered , a faint companion to twa 5 ( see discussion ) .",
    "otherwise these observations preclude the presence of any unseen companions down to a typical @xmath13k = 4 magnitudes over the separation range from 02 to 10 as derived by determining the maximum amplitudes of cosine waves that could be hidden in the noise of the power spectra ( cf .",
    "ghez et al .",
    "1993 , henry 1991 ) . to search for wider companions ( @xmath0 1 - 3 )",
    ", individual images were aligned on the brightest speckle and summed ; these shift - and - add data are sensitive to a limiting @xmath13k @xmath0 6 magnitudes .",
    "lris spectra of the 7 newly discovered young stars and 6 of the previously known twa members are shown in fig .",
    "1a and 1b .",
    "all of the stars show the li",
    "i ( 6708 ) line in strong absorption with equivalent widths ( ew ) ranging from @xmath0 0.36   to 0.57   ( table 1 ) .",
    "the strengths of the li lines are typical of t tauri stars and distinctly above that found for pleiades stars at @xmath0 10@xmath14 years ( e.g. martn 1997 ) .",
    "each star , except hd 98800 , has h@xmath7 in strong emission . following the spectroscopic t tauri classification scheme of martn ( 1998 ) ,",
    "9 of the 13 are classified as true t tauri stars while the remaining 4 fall slightly ( but within the 50 m  uncertainty ) below the li ew strength threshold into the `` post - t tauri '' regime . of those classified as t tauri stars , 3 have h@xmath7 emission above the threshold ( martn 1997 ) for `` classical ''",
    "as opposed to `` weak - lined '' t tauri stars .",
    "this evolutionary state agrees with a cluster age of @xmath0 10 myr as discussed below .",
    "each of the newly discovered systems , along with the original five members , were strongly detected in the rosat all - sky survey .",
    "the x - ray luminosities normalized to the total stellar luminosities are listed in table 1 .",
    "all five new systems display a similarly large l@xmath15",
    "/ l@xmath16 consistent with kastner et al.s age determination ( 20 + /-",
    "10 million years ) placing them at a seldom studied evolutionary state  the transition between the t tauri and the post - t tauri phase .",
    "hipparcos observed four twa members ( hd 98800 , tw hya , twa 9 , & hr 4796 ) providing accurate parallactic distances and proper motions .",
    "the hipparcos distances to tw hya and hd 98800 , 56 pc and 47 pc respectively , are in excellent agreement with the estimates of kastner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; twa 9 and hr 4796 are at 50 pc and 67 pc , respectively .",
    "proper motions of other members were extracted from the spm database ( see table 1 and fig .",
    "while there is some dispersion , the proper motion among the twa members is fairly uniform . whether or not the motions are consistent with a common origin is controversial ( jensen et al .",
    "1998 , soderblom et al .",
    "1998 , hoff et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we defer discussion to a second paper in which we use echelle radial velocities to demonstrate common space motions for twa members ( webb , reid & zuckerman 1998 ) .",
    "given that we searched only in a limited solid angle of sky , one might ask whether a comparable spectroscopic survey of x - ray bright stars , but in a very different direction , would reveal many nearby stars of comparable young age .",
    "we think this is unlikely and that the twa represents a true localized association .",
    "support for this assertion is threefold :    first , consider the population of nearby ( @xmath17 70 pc ) stars with t tauri or a star characteristics which are far from dark clouds and which exhibit substantial excess ir emission ( defined here as a ratio of excess far - ir luminosity divided by total bolometric luminosity of 10@xmath18 or greater ) .",
    "many stars which appear to fulfil all these criteria have been shown to be peculiar post - main sequence stars .",
    "( e.g. , zuckerman et al 1995 ; fekel et al 1996 ; webb et al 1999 - in prep ) .",
    "indeed , we know of only 6 stars that satisfy the preceding criteria - four of the six are in the twa ( hd 98800 , tw hya , hen 600 , and hr 4796 ) .",
    "the other two are @xmath19 pic and 49 cet .",
    "this concentration points to the vicinity of tw hya as special .",
    "similarly , jensen et al . (",
    "1998 ) note an excess of young , low - velocity stars in the vicinity of tw hya .",
    "second , surveys of x - ray bright stars in other regions well separated from known dark clouds do not produce a similar number of t tauri stars . in our lris survey , 12 of our targets were late - type stars ( spectral types k5 or later ) and 5 of these have t tauri spectral characteristics .",
    "we consider only late - type stars because the li depletion time is short and there is a clear distinction in li ew between t tauri ( 10 myr ) and pleiades ( 120 myr ) age stars .",
    "magnani and colleagues have searched for t tauri stars toward 3 widely separated translucent clouds : mbm 40 ( magnani et al 1996 ) and mbm 7 and 55 ( hearty et al 1998 ) which are located at @xmath20b@xmath20 @xmath0 40 degrees .",
    "their target list consisted of x - ray bright rosat stars ; they list 42 with spectral type similar to the twa members .",
    "none showed substantial lithium absorption in vivid contrast to results of our lris survey near tw hya .",
    "also , in 1998 september we surveyed 11 late k and m - type , x - ray bright field stars , many of which are listed in fleming ( 1998 ) , with the kast spectrograph on the 3 m shane telescope at lick observatory .",
    "none showed any detectable li with an upper limit of @xmath0 50 m .    and",
    "third , if t tauri stars are truly widely distributed in the solar neighborhood , then we would anticipate seeing many x - ray bright post t tauri stars in the 10 - 100 million year age range .",
    "as we mention below , our lris data show no evidence of such a population .",
    "together these characteristics are adequate to firmly establish the stars in table 1 as a physical association .    in fig .",
    "3 , we use the photometry obtained at the irtf ( assuming a distance of 50 pc for those stars without measured parallax ) and the spectral types derived from the lris spectra to place the twa members on the pre - main sequence ( pms ) tracks of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) .",
    "all the stars , with the possible exception of twa 9 , are clearly above the zero - age main sequence and , within the uncertainties , are consistent with a cluster age of @xmath0 10@xmath2 years .",
    "twa 9 a & b are likely younger than they appear on fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath070 myr ) . with ews of @xmath0 500 m , their li lines are much stronger than any similar stars in the pleiades ( e.g. martn 1997 ) .",
    "possible explanations for their apparent greater ages include : derived spectral types that are too hot , larger than expected errors in the photometry , circumstellar extinction or an error in the hipparcos distance ( the @xmath020 pc required to put twa 9 on the 10@xmath2 yr isochrone is a 3@xmath21 deviation ) .",
    "the age of the twa is moderately well constrained .",
    "detailed study of hd 98800 yields 10 @xmath22 myr ( soderblom et al . 1998 ) and of hr 4796 gives 8 - 10 myr(stauffer et al 1995 , jura et al 1998 ) .",
    "our data are consistent with these estimates : the twa stars appear nearly along the same isochrone ( @xmath0 8 myr ; fig .",
    "3 ) , though the distance uncertainty adds substantial scatter .",
    "the high ratio of x - ray to total luminosity is characteristic of stars evolved beyond the early t tauri phase suggesting an age of 10 - 100 myr . and",
    "the spectral characteristics indicate that , within the errors of our measurements and the classification scheme , all members are likely weak - lined or classical t tauri stars . in our sample of @xmath0 45 other x - ray bright stars in this region , _ none",
    "_ displayed significant li i absorption which would fill in the `` post - t tauri star gap '' noted by , e.g. , martn ( 1997 ) .",
    "this implies that the twa stars are not the young tail of a large population of post - t tauri stars , but rather a distinct group of old t tauri stars with an age less than a few times 10@xmath2 years .",
    "a probable companion to twa 5 was found @xmath0 2  north of the primary in shift - and - add processing of the irtf speckle data ( fig .",
    "4 ) . the primary and companion differ in magnitude by @xmath13k = 4.7 @xmath23 0.1 .",
    "the companion was also revealed in our lris i - band images following a deconvolution of the primary s point spread function with the iraf daophot package .",
    "scaling a psf from a field star and fitting the wings of the ( saturated ) primary indicates @xmath13i = 6.9 @xmath23 0.4 magnitudes .",
    "the measured @xmath13i , @xmath13k , and i - k color ( table 1 ) suggest a spectral type of m8 to m8.5 , according to the color relations of kirkpatrick & mccarthy ( 1994 ) .    the companion is shown as a 4-pt .",
    "star in fig .",
    "the tracks indicate a mass of about 20 m@xmath24 ; this estimate is largely insensitive to variations in luminosity ( i.e. distance and/or age ) .",
    "the major uncertainty is the photometric error associated with the i - band deconvolution and the temperature scale for young , late - m stars .",
    "however , the steepness of i - k color for late - m stars constrains the uncertainty to within @xmath01.5 subclasses .",
    "uncertainties in the spectral - type to temperature conversion are discussed in luhman , liebert & reike ( 1997 ) and lowrance et al .",
    "although there is no proper motion confirmation of companionship , the small separation at relatively high galactic latitude and the fact that twa 5b appears to be coeval with the primary imply that it is likely a physical companion ( see also lowrance et al .",
    "1998 ) .    given the rarity of young isolated stars in other parts of the sky , we believe that hr 4796 a & b are twa members despite their position on the edge of the cluster both in direction ( @xmath018@xmath1 from the cluster center ) and in distance ( 67 pc ; @xmath015 pc further than the mean distance ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from hr 4796 , which is emitted by the `` b '' component ( jura et al .",
    "1998 ) , is consistent with that of the other members .",
    "thus in every respect  age , li abundance , kinematics & x - ray brightness ",
    "hr 4796b appears very similar to the other twa stars .",
    "eleven young star systems , totaling at least 19 stars and a brown dwarf , are now known in the vicinity of the isolated , classical t tauri star , tw hya . given the youth of each of the members , the far - infrared excess emission at four of the twa systems , and the common motions demonstrated in webb , reid & zuckerman ( 1998 ) ,",
    "it is very unlikely that this group of young stars is anything but a bona fide association of t tauri stars with a common origin .",
    "this uniquely close group of young stars is an ideal laboratory to study star and planetary formation processes .",
