    "the infrared sector of strong interaction physics is characterized by nonperturbative phenomena such as confinement , the breaking of chiral symmetry , and the @xmath0 problem .",
    "these phenomena are believed to be described by quantum chromodynamics ; however , in order to understand in more detail how they arise , it is helpful to isolate the particular degrees of freedom of the theory which induce these phenomena .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking and the @xmath0 problem can e.g. be successfully explained in terms of instanton effects @xcite , whereas confinement eludes a description via instantons @xcite .",
    "viable explanations of confinement can be based on magnetic degrees of freedom such as abelian magnetic monopoles @xcite or center vortices @xcite,@xcite ; considerable evidence in favor of such scenaria has accumulated in recent years from numerical lattice studies .",
    "magnetic monopoles emerge in yang - mills theory as gauge fixing defects in the so - called abelian gauges @xcite , where the cartan subgroup of the gauge group under consideration is left unfixed . in all abelian gauges considered",
    ", the vacuum behaves as a dual superconductor @xcite ; in particular , lattice calculations performed in the maximal abelian gauge @xcite,@xcite exhibit abelian and monopole dominance for the string tension . on the other hand , lattice calculations performed in the so - called maximal center gauge @xcite , which will be discussed in detail in this work ,",
    "have provided evidence in favor of the notion that confinement is induced by center vortices .",
    "the vortex content of gauge field configurations produces virtually the full string tension ; conversely , the string tension disappears in the absence of vortices @xcite .",
    "this property of _ center dominance",
    "_ persists at finite temperatures @xcite,@xcite , and the deconfinement phase transition can be understood as a transition from a percolating vortex phase to a phase in which the vortices cease to percolate .",
    "the aforementioned magnetic degrees of freedom inducing confinement can furthermore be connected with the topological properties commonly thought to be carried by instantons ; they may therefore ultimately be suited to provide a unified picture of the different nonperturbative strong interaction phenomena mentioned further above .",
    "the magnetic monopoles of the maximal abelian gauge have been empirically found to be correlated with instantons in lattice calculations @xcite . in another abelian gauge , the polyakov gauge ,",
    "the pontryagin index can be entirely reconstructed from the magnetic monopole content of gauge field configurations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the foci of the present work is to elucidate the manner in which center vortex configurations generate the pontryagin index ; it will be shown that the latter is produced by self - intersections of vortex world - surfaces , where it is crucial that the surfaces be globally non - oriented .",
    "in a recent lattice study @xcite , the orientability of the vortex surfaces was studied , with the result that these surfaces are non - orientable in the confining phase and have non - trivial genus .",
    "furthermore , in an ensemble devoid of vortices , chiral symmetry breaking disappears and all configurations belong to the trivial topological sector @xcite .    for the abovementioned lattice studies of vortex properties to become possible , techniques had to be developed which allow to associate a given lattice gauge configuration with a configuration of vortex world - surfaces .",
    "such techniques have only become available in relatively recent times ; this has revived interest in the vortex picture , which received rather little attention after some early efforts following its inception @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the techniques referred to here are the maximal center gauge and center projection @xcite,@xcite already mentioned further above . while not all questions concerning the numerical stability of this procedure and its ability to faithfully represent thick center fluxes present in full gauge configurations have been settled @xcite , it has facilitated a number of observations concerning vortex physics in addition to those already mentioned further above .",
    "e.g. , the density of the center vortices obtained via the maximal center gauge and center projection displays the proper scaling behavior required under the renormalization group and , consequently , these vortices can be considered as physical objects @xcite ( note erratum in @xcite ) , see also @xcite",
    ". also binary correlations of vortex intersection points found on a given space - time plane display such scaling @xcite .",
    "furthermore , center vortices can account for the casimir scaling behavior of the adjoint string tension if one associates a finite physical thickness with the vortex world - surfaces @xcite,@xcite . in an indirect version of the maximal center gauge , which proceeds via an intermediate maximal abelian gauge fixing",
    ", both abelian magnetic monopoles and center vortices were detected @xcite ; the monopoles were found to be located on center vortices like beads on a string .",
    "one of the foremost aims of this work is to develop a continuum formulation for the center gauge and center projection procedure .",
    "this will also shed some additional light on issues concerning the procedure on the lattice .",
    "it should be clear that the attempt to construct an analogue of the maximal center gauge in the continuum encounters some conceptual obstacles not found in continuum formulations of abelian gauges , which are quite straightforward .",
    "these obstacles are related to the fact that the continuum theory is constructed in terms of a gauge potential , defined in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , as opposed to the lattice formulation in terms of group elements on lattice links .",
    "the continuum gauge fields are thus insensitive to the center of the gauge group .",
    "it is a priori not clear how to extend the successful concept of center projection to the continuum theory . nevertheless , it will prove possible in this work to derive a continuum analogue of the lattice procedure .    in detail , the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ mcglatsec ] ,",
    "the maximal center gauge and the emergence of center vortices after center projection is carefully analyzed on the lattice .",
    "the effect of this gauge on sample gauge fields of the vortex type is studied empirically ; subsequently , the gauge fixing procedure on the lattice is reformulated in a manner which explicitly separates the @xmath1 center and @xmath2 coset degrees of freedom .",
    "the continuum limit of center and coset lattice configurations is considered in section [ tcontlim ] , along with the gauge transformations which arise in the course of maximal center gauge fixing .",
    "explicit continuum representations of center vortices are given .",
    "this allows the construction of the continuum analogue of the maximal center gauge , the properties of which are then discussed extensively , including alternative formulations which allow to extract more general objects of the vortex type ; for reasons mentioned further above , vortex surfaces made up of patches of different orientation are of particular interest , as well as thickened vortices . in section [ effthsec ] ,",
    "the implementation of the maximal center gauge in the continuum path integral is considered , and a sketch of an effective vortex theory is given .",
    "finally , the pontryagin index generated by center vortex configurations is studied in section [ topsect ] .",
    "the concluding section [ outlsec ] discusses some open issues to be settled in subsequent work .",
    "some mathematical details are presented in the appendices .",
    "maximal center gauge is a gauge fixing condition defined in the lattice formulation of @xmath3 yang - mills theory .",
    "it prescribes that the gauge freedom @xmath4 be used to transform the link variables @xmath5 of a given lattice configuration as close as possible to center elements of the gauge group , in a sense still to be specified .",
    "in fact , there exist many different specifications , or realizations , of the general idea formulated above .",
    "one possible explicit gauge fixing condition , first introduced in @xcite for the case of @xmath6 color color were discussed in @xcite,@xcite . ] as the `` direct maximal center gauge '' , is @xmath7 for arbitrary local @xmath6 gauge transformations @xmath8 .    in order to make this more transparent ,",
    "represent the @xmath6 link variables as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the pauli matrices and the parameters @xmath11 , fulfil the constraint @xmath12 to guarantee unitarity of the links .",
    "note that ( [ unit2 ] ) defines a three - sphere in the space of parameters @xmath13 . in the following",
    ", the set of group elements with @xmath14 will sometimes be referred to as the `` northern hemisphere '' of the @xmath6 group , and the set of group elements with @xmath15 as the `` southern hemisphere '' .",
    "the poles of the sphere , @xmath16 , correspond to the center @xmath17 of the @xmath6 group .",
    "correspondingly , the gauge condition ( [ mcg ] ) reduces to @xmath18 which can be straightforwardly visualized in terms of a bias of the link variables towards the poles of the @xmath6 three - sphere .",
    "an important property of the condition ( [ mcg ] ) is the fact that it leaves the center part of the gauge freedom , i.e. ( for the general case of a @xmath3 gauge group ) the @xmath1 part , unfixed .",
    "there is no bias distinguishing between different center elements due to the absolute value prescription in ( [ mcg ] ) .",
    "this is analogous to the so - called abelian gauges @xcite , which leave the abelian part of the gauge freedom , i.e. the @xmath19^{n-1}$ ] part , unfixed .",
    "the specific condition ( [ mcg ] ) is only one of many ways to bias link variables towards the center of the gauge group .",
    "in fact , any condition of the type @xmath20 with a monotonously rising function @xmath21 implements the general idea of maximal center gauge fixing .    after transforming a lattice gauge configuration to the maximal center gauge , one can carry out a second step , called _ center projection _ , which serves to define the @xmath1 vortex content of the configuration .",
    "center projection corresponds to mapping every link variable @xmath22 onto the center element closest to @xmath22 . in the case of the @xmath6 gauge group ,",
    "this simply means mapping @xmath23 i.e. @xmath24 in other words , all link variables located on the northern hemisphere are mapped onto the north pole of the @xmath6 group , all links on the southern hemisphere onto the south pole . for general @xmath3 group , center projection leaves one with a @xmath1 lattice , which in the canonical fashion can be associated with @xmath25-dimensional vortex surfaces ( where @xmath26 denotes the space - time dimension ) on the dual lattice : if any plaquette on the @xmath1 lattice evaluates to a nontrivial center element , it is considered to be pierced by a vortex carrying the appropriate ( quantized ) flux ; if it takes the trivial value unity , no vortex pierces the plaquette .",
    "the vortices defined in this way represent @xmath25-dimensional surfaces in @xmath26 space - time dimensions .",
    "the center flux carried by the vortices is continuous ; there are no sources or sinks for this flux . in the case of a @xmath17 lattice",
    ", this corresponds to the vortex surfaces being closed . in the general @xmath1 case",
    ", the surfaces may branch , while respecting flux conservation , since more than one nontrivial center flux exists .",
    "however , precisely due to flux conservation , one may think also of such branched surfaces in the @xmath1 case as being composed of simple closed surfaces which in general share whole surface patches in space - time .      for the purpose of illustrating the effect of the center gauge condition , consider the following sample continuum @xmath6 gauge field configurations on a two - dimensional plane .",
    "let the plane be parametrized in polar coordinates @xmath27 and define the gauge field as of the gauge group satisfying @xmath28 = f_{abc } t_c $ ] , with @xmath29 denoting the structure coefficients , and the normalization tr@xmath30 . for @xmath6 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , denotes the pauli matrices .",
    "] @xmath34 this configuration , and the ones to follow below , can be regarded as slices of configurations defined in more space - time dimensions , and which , for the present purposes , can be considered constant in the additional dimensions .",
    "also the lorentz components of the gauge field associated with those additional directions should be considered to vanish .",
    "the above configuration is a particular example of what in the following will be called a _ thin vortex _ ( positioned at the origin of the plane ) .",
    "a general representation of thin vortices will be given in eq .",
    "( [ arbthv ] ) .",
    "the defining property of a thin vortex is that any wilson loop which encircles the vortex , i.e. in the present case , the origin , takes a nontrivial value in the center of the gauge group . for the case of @xmath6 color",
    ", this corresponds to the value @xmath35 . on the other hand , any other wilson loop ,",
    "not encircling the vortex , takes the value @xmath36 . in other words",
    ", the vortex contributes a nontrivial center element of the gauge group to any wilson loop it pierces .",
    "correspondingly , the field strength is singular and localized at the position of the vortex .",
    "note that both choices of sign in ( [ thinv ] ) lead to these properties .",
    "thus , one can distinguish two different orientations of vortices , associated with the direction of ( magnetic ) flux they describe ( flux which is dual to wilson loops will sometimes be referred to as `` magnetic '' in the following ) . on the other hand , also ( odd ) integral multiples of the configurations ( [ thinv ] ) satisfy the defining properties of center vortices . however , such configurations will not be considered as distinct types of vortices , but simply as superpositions of vortices of the smallest abelian magnetic flux required to induce the center element in question in a wilson loop .",
    "consider furthermore the more general configuration @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this configuration represents a _ thick vortex _ ; in order for a wilson loop to take the value @xmath35 , it must circumscribe the vortex at a sufficient distance , the thickness of the vortex , determined by the form of the _ profile function _ @xmath40 .",
    "also the field strength or the flux associated with a thick vortex are spread out as compared to the singular localized field strength of a thin vortex ( [ thinv ] ) . for certain purposes , such as calculating field strengths",
    ", it may be necessary to specify more precisely what one means by the singularity of the thin vortex ( [ thinv ] ) at the origin ; this becomes relevant e.g. in appendix [ appc ] . in such a case , the thin vortex should always be viewed as the limit in which @xmath41 for @xmath42 , but still @xmath43 in ( [ thickv ] ) .",
    "these configurations can be put on a two - dimensional lattice in the canonical fashion by associating the path - ordered exponential @xmath44 with a link @xmath45 describing a path @xmath46 originating from the point @xmath47 and running in the @xmath48-direction .",
    "note that path - ordering @xmath49 is not actually necessary for the abelian configurations ( [ thinv ] ) and ( [ thickv ] ) .",
    "this procedure of putting the continuum configurations on the lattice preserves the values of wilson loops taken in the corresponding configurations , as described above .    in practice",
    ", it is desirable to treat a lattice of finite extent with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. a lattice torus . in order to fulfil such boundary conditions",
    ", it is necessary to have zero net flux piercing the plane under consideration . ] .",
    "for this reason , in the following , linear superpositions of pairs of ( thin or thick ) vortices of opposite orientation will be examined , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) . due to the abelian character of the configurations defined above",
    ", the phases contributed to wilson loops by single vortices in a many - vortex superposition simply add , without interference from path - ordering effects .",
    "furthermore , in calculating the lattice links from the gauge fields , also the contributions from periodic images of the vortices must be taken into account .",
    "this is merely a point of technical convenience . ] .",
    "= 14.5 cm    having put the gauge configurations on the lattice , the question can be addressed what effect the center gauge fixing procedure has on these configurations . for the case of two thin vortices , fixing the configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) to maximal center gauge can be carried out trivially without any recourse to numerical computation .",
    "all one needs are the following two observations : the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) is gauge equivalent to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) since all wilson loops take the same values in the two configurations . at the same time , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) all links take values in the center of the gauge group . therefore",
    ", this configuration realizes the maximal possible value of the gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) .",
    "thus , the configuration shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ( b ) is precisely a center gauge fixing image of the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) .",
    "it is described by a string of links taking a value corresponding to a nontrivial center element extending from the position of one thin vortex to the position of the other .",
    "this type of configuration , i.e. strings of links associated with a nontrivial center element of the gauge group , will in the following be termed a configuration of _ ideal vortices_. it is , as just seen , gauge equivalent to a configuration of _ thin vortices _ at the positions where the strings end .",
    "it should be noted that there exist many other degenerate maxima of the gauge fixing functional on the same gauge orbit , namely all deformations of the string of links , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) .",
    "these are all images of the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) under gauge transformations which are elements of the center of the gauge group .",
    "this is not surprising ; by construction , the gauge fixing condition ( [ mcgg ] ) is invariant under such transformations ( e.g. in the @xmath6 case , it is insensitive to the sign of the link variables ) . in other words , it leaves the center of the gauge group unfixed . as a consequence ,",
    "the precise trajectory of the string of nontrivial links describing ideal vortices is arbitrary ; only its two endpoints ( corresponding here to the positions of the two thin vortices ) are fixed , and they embody all gauge - invariant information .",
    "note that in three - dimensional space - time , the sets of nontrivial links describing ideal vortices generically form two - dimensional sheets , whereas in four - dimensional space - time , they form three - dimensional volumes . the boundaries of the sheets or volumes , respectively , describe the locations of the thin vortices to which the ideal vortex configuration is gauge equivalent .    as",
    "a further aside , note that center projection leaves the center gauge fixed configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) ) unchanged and thus does not truncate any physical information contained in it .",
    "by contrast , center projecting the original configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) ) before gauge fixing completely removes the vortices and yields a trivial lattice with all links at unity .",
    "continuing to the case of a thick vortex , it is clear that this case can not be solved in a similarly trivial fashion . here",
    ", the latticized gauge configurations can be brought into the maximal center gauge numerically by maximizing the gauge functional ( [ mcgg ] ) under the action of arbitrary @xmath6 gauge transformations on the sites of the lattice .",
    "as described above , lattice tori containing four vortices were used .",
    "two different cases were examined : two thick vortices of one orientation together with two thin vortices of the other orientation ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) ) , and one thick vortex together with three thin vortices , again such that the total flux piercing the plane vanishes ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) ) . in order to make the new effects arising in the case of a thick vortex more visible ,",
    "a fermi distribution @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the lattice spacing , was chosen for the profile function @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "( [ thickv ] ) ) .",
    "this not only spreads out the flux of the vortex but actually localizes it on a ring of radius @xmath52 concentric to the core of the vortex .",
    "the gauge equivalent configurations which maximize the center gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) will contain a certain set of links which lie in the `` southern hemisphere '' of the @xmath6 group , i.e. nearer to the center element @xmath35 , whereas the other links remain closer to the center element @xmath36 . center projection then associates a collection of ideal vortices , or , gauge - equivalently , thin vortices , with the original configuration . carrying out this procedure numerically for the configurations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one obtains thin vortices which approximate the locations of the original thick vortices ; however , the precise location of the thin vortex within the profile of the thick vortex turns out to depend on the precise realization of the center gauge via the arbitrary function @xmath21 in the gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) .",
    "specifically , for the configuration containing one thick vortex , fig .  [ fig2 ] ( b )",
    ", it turns out that for the gauge fixing function @xmath53 , the thin vortex is located concentrically with the thick vortex , whereas for @xmath54 , the thin vortex is located one lattice spacing away from the center of the thick vortex .",
    "this latter effect becomes more pronounced if one uses the configuration with two thick vortices , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) , again with the gauge fixing function @xmath54 . there",
    ", the thin vortex is located four lattice spacings away from the center of the thick vortex , i.e. on the ring of flux depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) .",
    "the conclusion reached from these examples is therefore that the maximal center gauge does yield thin vortices which roughly approximate the locations of thick vortices in gauge field configurations .",
    "this corroborates the findings of @xcite,@xcite ; note however recent indications of considerable instability in the numerical gauge - fixing procedure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the precise coordinates of the thin center projection vortices turn out to be gauge - dependent , via the gauge fixing function @xmath21 . also , comparing the results obtained with the two different configurations depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the precise location of a thin vortex approximating a given thick vortex evidently also depends on the structure of other vortices in the vicinity .",
    "therefore , it seems that the center gauge fixing procedure introduces nonlocal interactions into the center projection vortex effective theory independent of any reference to the yang - mills dynamics which ultimately governs the original thick vortex configurations .      in the attempt to formulate an analogue of the center gauge and center projection procedure in continuum yang - mills theory ,",
    "one obviously encounters a conceptual obstacle : continuum yang - mills theory is described in terms of a gauge potential @xmath55 which is defined in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "thus , in the continuum , the gauge symmetry of yang - mills theory is only a local @xmath2 , i.e. a coset , symmetry .",
    "related considerations concerning this issue in the schrdinger picture can be found in @xcite .",
    "the first step in dealing with this problem is to carefully separate center and coset degrees of freedom in the lattice gauge fixing procedure discussed above .",
    "the treatment below will for simplicity mainly concentrate on the case of an @xmath6 gauge group ; however , the generalization to any @xmath3 group is conceptually , if not necessarily notationally , straightforward .",
    "one only has to keep in mind that higher @xmath3 groups have more center elements , and that therefore there are more species of vortices , corresponding to the different possible fluxes .",
    "the only qualitative difference in terms of the topology of vortex configurations is that , for higher gauge groups ( and three or more space - time dimensions ) , vortices may branch into several vortices with different center fluxes , as long as flux conservation is respected at branchings .    to have a slightly more precise terminology at hand in the discussion below ,",
    "it is useful to decompose the link variables @xmath5 describing a @xmath6 lattice configuration into a center part @xmath56 and a coset part @xmath57 defined by @xmath58 the lattice described by @xmath59 will be referred to as the _ center part _ of the lattice configuration @xmath5 , whereas the lattice described by @xmath60 will be referred to as the _ coset part_. note that the center gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) depends only on the coset part of a configuration ; center projection simply means mapping @xmath5 onto @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , below the terminology _ coset transformation _ will be used to characterize gauge transformations , cf .",
    "( [ latgtra ] ) , which change only the coset part of a lattice configuration . note that this does not imply that the corresponding unitary transformation matrices acting at lattice sites are necessarily from the northern hemisphere of the @xmath6 group .",
    "note furthermore that the set of possible coset transformations depends on the initial gauge configuration and that in general not all members of this set can be continuously deformed to the identity while remaining in the set .",
    "also , smooth gauge transformations @xmath61 in the continuum formulation of yang - mills theory , @xmath62 are by construction coset gauge transformations .    clearly , if one puts a smooth continuum gauge configuration @xmath63 onto a sufficiently fine lattice , the associated center part is trivial , @xmath64 .",
    "however , even in such a case , gauge fixing in general , and the center gauge fixing procedure in particular , may induce a nontrivial center part in the gauge fixed lattice ; explicit examples were given in the previous section .",
    "in other words , some links in the gauge fixed lattice end up in the southern hemisphere , i.e. closer to the nontrivial center element @xmath35 than to the trivial element @xmath36 ; ideal vortices are introduced .    in the @xmath6 lattice description of the center gauge fixing procedure ,",
    "one allows arbitrary @xmath6 gauge transformations when maximizing the gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) .",
    "this procedure can be broken down into smaller steps as follows .    1 .",
    "start from a configuration with a trivial center part , i.e. with all links in the northern hemisphere , such as one obtains by putting any smooth continuum gauge configuration onto a sufficiently fine lattice .",
    "apply a gauge transformation which rotates a certain arbitrary , but fixed , set of links to the southern hemisphere , i.e. such that the center part of the transformed lattice displays the nontrivial value @xmath35 on that set of links to the site from which the links in question emanate and the group element @xmath65 to the site at which they end , i.e. @xmath66 , where @xmath22 denotes the original link variable associated with the link under consideration .",
    "one can also exchange @xmath8 and @xmath65 , which may become necessary if two links in question share a site . ] .",
    "2 .   maximize the gauge fixing functional using only coset transformations , i.e. keeping the center part of the configuration invariant .",
    "in other words , links are not allowed to switch `` hemispheres '' of the @xmath6 group .",
    "note that this second step operates purely on the coset part of the lattice configuration obtained after step 1 . ) above ; not only are only coset transformations allowed , but also the gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) depends exclusively on the coset part of the link variables .",
    "finally , this two step procedure must be repeated for all possible first step choices of the center part of the transformed lattice , in order to cover all possible gauge transformations contained in the full @xmath6 gauge group . for each of these choices , corresponding to a certain ideal vortex configuration ,",
    "one obtains in the associated second step a constrained maximum of the gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) ; from all these maxima , one must choose the highest one in order to obtain the gauge - fixed configuration reached under the action of the full @xmath6 gauge group .",
    "slightly rephrased , the procedure described above splits the process of center gauge fixing under the @xmath6 gauge group up into the following parts : one introduces , by a suitable gauge transformation , into an initially smooth gauge configuration ideal vortices at fixed , but arbitrary , locations",
    ". this step transfers information from the coset part into the center part of the configuration . from this point",
    "onwards , however , center and coset parts remain strictly separated and subsequent gauge transformations operate only on the coset part .",
    "the latter is transformed , by using purely coset transformations , to the ( constrained ) maximum of the ( purely coset - dependent ) gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgg ] ) .",
    "the algorithm must be repeated for all possible choices of ideal vortex configurations .",
    "the choice which leads to the global maximum of the gauge fixing functional determines the center gauge and center projection image of the original configuration .",
    "formally , one can summarize this as follows . the center gauge fixing condition , cf . eq . ( [ mcgg ] )",

    "the prime emphasizes explicitly that only the coset part of the resulting configuration is considered further , although this is already guaranteed by the absolute value prescription . in other words , the configurations @xmath70 are stripped of all ideal vortices .",
    "finally , @xmath61 denotes all coset gauge transformations considered in step 2 . ) above .",
    "as the first step in formulating a continuum version of the maximal center gauge , it is necessary to define the continuum analogues of the various lattice configurations considered above .      the coset part of a lattice configuration can be directly associated with a regular continuum gauge field constructed such as to reproduce all links of the coset configuration if put on the lattice .",
    "one could e.g. achieve this construction by giving an `` inverse blocking '' prescription , successively replacing coarser by finer lattices while dividing up the phases carried by the coarse links onto the fine links such as to achieve a smooth continuum limit . in this limit",
    ", it will be possible to expand an exponential representation of the link variables @xmath71 into powers of the lattice spacing @xmath51 and regard @xmath72 as the continuum gauge field .",
    "as a side remark , note that if one wished to apply such an `` inverse blocking '' procedure to the center part of a configuration , the corresponding prescription would have to be radically different in order to preserve the center , or ideal vortex , character of the configuration : if a nontrivial center link of a coarse lattice is divided up into two links of a finer lattice , the whole nontrivial center phase would have to be associated with one of the two links , whereas the other link would be associated with unity .",
    "the phase is not divided up among the two links , in contrast to the coset case , and the continuum limit is singular . in particular , expanding an exponential representation analogous to ( [ cosexp ] ) is by construction never possible for the center part of a configuration . due to these difficulties , a different approach will have to be taken when discussing the continuum limit of the center part below .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worth noting that the gauge freedom associated with the continuum gauge field @xmath73 in ( [ cosexp ] ) matches the one associated with the coset lattice @xmath74 in step 2 . ) of the center gauge fixing procedure as described in section [ sepsec ] ; namely , it consists of all possible coset transformations .",
    "thus , in describing a coset lattice in the continuum limit by means of a gauge field @xmath73 as in ( [ cosexp ] ) , one is not introducing any restriction on the residual gauge freedom allowed in step 2 . ) of the center gauge fixing procedure . the additional gauge freedom implied by the full @xmath3 symmetry",

    "the center part of a configuration contains exclusively ideal vortices , described by sets of links taking a nontrivial value from the center of the gauge group . at this point",
    ", it is useful to give an alternative characterization of such a configuration which does not make explicit reference to a space - time lattice .",
    "this can be achieved via the effect the configuration has on arbitrary wilson lines .",

    "the choice @xmath231 for the gauge fixing function thus at first sight does not seem very useful , since it can not lead to a faithful representation of the vortex content of the original smooth gauge field @xmath86 .",
    "the same is true for any @xmath254 which diverges as fast as , or faster than , @xmath231 as @xmath255 .",
    "the choice of gauge fixing function @xmath231 is the continuum analogue of a variety of lattice gauge fixing functions @xmath256 , cf .",
    "( [ redefg ] ) in the limit @xmath257 . among these is the case @xmath258 ( after leaving away irrelevant constants ) .",
    "this is the standard `` direct maximal center gauge '' @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . strictly speaking , therefore",
    ", this gauge does not have a useful continuum limit on the level of gauge fixing individual smooth continuum gauge field configurations .",
    "the question arises how this gauge leads to a finite center projection vortex density in the continuum limit of the lattice formulation , as evidenced by the renormalization group scaling behavior of this density @xcite ( note erratum in @xcite ) , see also @xcite .",
    "several possible explanations come to mind .    for one , in a lattice calculation ,",
    "one never takes the continuum limit of the field configurations at an intermediate stage .",
    "instead , one operates with regularized lattice configurations and only extrapolates observables at the end of the calculation to the continuum limit .",
    "thus , on the lattice , one always stays away a certain minimal distance from the @xmath250-singularity of the continuum thin vortex , i.e. one never probes the @xmath255 behavior of @xmath254 .",
    "more precisely , one can not make a distinction between @xmath231 and a `` capped '' version @xmath259 , with a sufficiently large value of @xmath260 .",
    "of course , as the lattice spacing is taken to zero , @xmath260 will have to diverge if @xmath220 and @xmath261 are to remain equivalent .",
    "now , it is entirely possible that the choice @xmath231 leads to scaling violations of the projection vortex density on very fine lattices , such that this density ultimately tends to zero . on the other hand , a capped version @xmath262 as above , with large but fixed @xmath260 , allows a finite projection vortex density for smooth continuum configurations .",
    "possibly , present lattices are still too coarse to reveal the above scaling violations and distinguish between @xmath231 and @xmath262 with large fixed @xmath260 .",
    "an observation which supports this possibility is that on present lattices , one still finds in typical configurations an abundance of negative plaquettes , i.e. structures indistinguishable from thin vortices on the scale of the lattice spacing . on the other hand ,",
    "the appeal of this explanation is lessened by the fact that it calls into question the relevance of the scaling behavior observed for the projection vortex density ; usually , such behavior is considered a firm indication that the continuum limit of an observable can be extrapolated with confidence .",
    "a second explanation can be based on the fact that functional integrals in field theory are dominated , for entropy reasons , by configurations with infinite action , not by smooth configurations @xcite .",
    "for instance , if typical configurations @xmath86 contain thin vortices , despite the fact that they are associated with a divergent yang - mills action , then in the process of maximal center gauge fixing , i.e. approximating the configurations by thin vortices , one would indeed introduce a nontrivial thin vortex configuration @xmath101 to cancel all thin vortices in the combination @xmath263 .",
    "this would happen also for the choice of gauge fixing function @xmath231 .",
    "however , it has been argued that thin vortices are too singular to survive the continuum limit of lattice yang - mills theory @xcite . in this simple form , this second explanation is therefore questionable .    however , a third explanation which is a slightly more sophisticated variant of the second one is possible .",
    "when fixing to the maximal center gauge on the lattice , one never finds the exact maximum of the gauge fixing functional , but only an approximation of this maximum .",
    "put another way , consider introducing the ( negative ) gauge fixing functional as a weight into the yang - mills partition function , @xmath264 -a)^2 \\right)\\ ] ] cf .",
    "( [ einfgc ] ) .",
    "then , in practice , one does not insist on the limit @xmath265 , which would imply finding the exact minimum of @xmath266 ; instead one may be satisfied with a finite value of @xmath267 . in this case ,",
    "a competition between the gauge fixing term and the yang - mills action ( and also a competition between different gribov copies , i.e. relative minima of @xmath266 ) becomes possible . even in a case such as @xmath231 , where the gauge fixing term in general will diverge for nontrivial thin vortex configurations @xmath101 ,",
    "these divergences may be swamped by the infinite action of typical yang - mills field configurations .",
    "note that for this to work , only yang - mills configurations considerably less singular than the thin vortices invoked in the second explanation above are necessary .",
    "e.g. , in the case of the gauge fixing function @xmath231 , the gauge fixing term for a nontrivial thin vortex configuration @xmath101 will diverge as @xmath268 , where @xmath128 denotes the distance from the thin vortex .",
    "this is independent of the dimension of space - time ; the coordinates perpendicular to a vortex always span two dimensions . on the other hand , in four space - time dimensions , already a gauge field configuration which behaves as @xmath250 in the vicinity of a point singularity will induce an action diverging as @xmath269 ; a divergence of the same degree is induced by a @xmath270 line singularity or a @xmath271 sheet singularity in four space - time dimensions .      the remarks above illustrate that the continuum maximal center gauge in the form derived in section [ congsec ] in a sense constitutes excessive rigor . in a _ dynamical _ calculation , one is forced to introduce a regularization of divergences in the ultraviolet ; this regularization in particular also smears out the thin vortex configurations @xmath129 , used in maximal center gauge fixing , into thick vortices with a thickness related to the ultraviolet cutoff . in view of this regularization , dictated by the dynamics",
    ", it is not mandated to consider at an intermediate stage the behavior of gauge field configurations as the cutoff is removed . instead",
    ", the cutoff must be kept finite throughout the calculation , and only the continuum limit of physical observables , as encoded in their renormalization group behavior , is relevant .",
    "this suggests an alternative formulation of the gauge fixing procedure in which one approximates a given gauge configuration as well as possible by thick vortices .",
    "specifically , one can generalize the gauge condition ( [ gaucon ] ) and the remaining maximization problem ( [ einfgc ] ) by allowing the approximating configurations @xmath129 to comprise thick vortices .",
    "of course , such a generalization clouds the original idea of the maximal center gauge , namely keeping the center part of the gauge freedom on the lattice unfixed ; instead , it operates purely with continuum , i.e. coset configurations .",
    "therefore , such gauges should be more appropriately called maximal vortex gauges rather than center gauges .    in such vortex gauges",
    ", one has an additional freedom in the choice of the thickness of the approximating vortex configurations @xmath129 . on the one hand",
    ", one may choose the thickness to be related to the ultraviolet cutoff with which one regulates the theory ; for example , the thickness may simply be the lattice spacing .",
    "this form would be entirely equivalent to the maximal center gauge in the lattice theory , since , at the level of the regularized theory , there is no distinction between such a thick vortex and a truly thin one .",
    "on the other hand , one may choose the thickness to be a fixed physical quantity ( which can be varied to optimally match the vortex profile preferred by the yang - mills dynamics ) .",
    "in this form , the thick vortex profile can also take over the role of the gauge fixing function @xmath220 .",
    "for example , as evidenced in the examples given further above , the gauge fixing function @xmath220 can act as a regulator for the divergences introduced into the gauge fixing functional by the singularities of the thin vortices . in a vortex gauge with thick vortices ,",
    "this is already achieved by the vortex thickness . in many respects ,",
    "the vortex profile in the vortex gauge has a similar effect as the gauge fixing function @xmath220 in the maximal center gauge .    as an aside ,",
    "note that in a consistently regularized theory , one should also use regularized versions of the ideal vortex configurations @xmath272 , cf .",
    "( [ idvorc ] ) , which one simply obtains by using the ultraviolet cutoff of the theory to smooth out the @xmath273-functions in ( [ idvorc ] ) , cf .",
    "( [ regidv ] ) .",
    "lastly , a certain aspect of continuum thin ( or , equivalently , ideal ) vortices has not yet been discussed in detail , namely the possibility that there may exist distinct thin vortex fluxes which contribute an identical phase to any wilson loop they link .",
    "an example of this was given already in section [ examse ] ; in the @xmath6 thin vortex configuration , eq .",
    "( [ thinv ] ) , @xmath274 both choices of sign lead to the same effect on a linked wilson loop .",
    "both choices correspond to a cartan chromomagnetic flux described by @xmath275 , cf .",
    "( [ su2e ] ) , but they differ in the direction , or orientation , of the flux , which is inverted when the sign is reversed",
    ".    on the other hand , on a @xmath17 lattice , one can not distinguish between these two possibilities , since one formulates the theory directly in terms of group elements . on a @xmath17 lattice , there is only one type of center vortex flux , defined by plaquettes taking the value @xmath35 .",
    "information about the orientation of the flux is lost during lattice center projection . for the purpose of evaluating wilson loops",
    ", this is immaterial ; however , there may be other observables which are sensitive to the orientation of vortex flux .",
    "an important example of this , namely the pontryagin index , will be discussed in detail in section [ topsect ] .",
    "thus , to obtain a comprehensive description of infrared phenomena in yang - mills theory , it is necessary to project onto a slightly more general class of infrared effective degrees of freedom than the essentially unoriented center vortices defined by lattice center projection .",
    "namely , vortex surfaces should additionally be associated with an orientation , and should in general consist of patches of differing orientation . as will be shown in section [ topsect ] in detail ,",
    "the edges of these patches can be associated with abelian magnetic monopole trajectories .",
    "the continuum center vortices introduced in the past sections do already include information about the orientation of magnetic flux .",
    "e.g. , in the discussion after eq .",
    "( [ redefg ] ) , when maximization over all hypersurfaces @xmath75 is called for , different orientations of @xmath75 can be used .",
    "likewise , in the discussion after eq .",
    "( [ einfgc ] ) , different orientations of @xmath88 , i.e. directions of flux in @xmath101 , are distinguishable .",
    "however , vortex surface patches of alternating orientation , bounded by abelian monopole currents , have hitherto not been allowed . on the contrary , the magnetic flux carried by thin vortex configurations",
    "@xmath101 has been assumed to be continuous throughout .",
    "the purpose of the the present discussion is merely to round out the treatment of maximal center gauge fixing and center projection by pointing out how it can easily be generalized to yield vortex surfaces made up of oriented patches .",
    "more detailed properties of such surfaces , including how they determine the pontryagin index , are discussed in section [ topsect ] .",
    "one way of introducing patches of different orientation on the vortex surfaces is to include information on abelian monopole degrees of freedom into the gauge fixing and projection procedure . as mentioned above",
    ", the trajectories of such monopoles on vortex surfaces define the edges of the oriented patches .",
    "such a procedure has already been defined and implemented in the lattice formulation , namely the `` indirect maximal center gauge '' introduced in @xcite and further investigated in @xcite .",
    "this procedure is defined by initially transforming a given lattice yang - mills configuration to the maximal abelian gauge and performing abelian projection , which allows to extract abelian monopole trajectories . in a subsequent step ,",
    "one transforms the residual abelian lattice configuration to the maximal center gauge and performs center projection , allowing the extraction of vortex surfaces .",
    "this two - step procedure , including two truncations of the theory by projection , is easily translated into the continuum formulation ; the maximal abelian gauge corresponds to the gauge fixing condition @xmath276 = 0\\ ] ] where @xmath277 denotes the color neutral ( cartan ) components of the gauge field , and @xmath278 denotes the color charged components . fixing to this gauge induces abelian monopoles in the resulting field configurations . after projecting the gauge - fixed configurations onto their color neutral part ( abelian projection ) , the maximal center gauge fixing procedure , as described in the past sections , can be implemented analogously , and the associated vortices extracted .",
    "note that the construction does not guarantee a priori that the monopoles are located on the vortex surfaces .",
    "however , monopoles have been found empirically to lie on the center vortices extracted via the indirect maximal center gauge in lattice experiments @xcite .    on the other hand , it is not strictly necessary to resort to such a two - step procedure , one of the steps being geared to extract abelian monopoles , and the other to extract center vortices .",
    "the coset gauge transformations @xmath225 in the maximal center gauge fixing functional ( [ mcgc ] ) in particular include gauge transformations which generate dirac strings .",
    "dirac strings , which describe open two - dimensional world - sheets in four - dimensional space - time , carry quantized magnetic flux such that they do not influence any wilson loop , in accordance with the fact that they are unobservable pure gauge artefacts .",
    "e.g. , in the case of @xmath6 color , a dirac string carries twice the magnetic flux of a thin vortex . before discussing the interplay between vortices and dirac strings , consider the following example for illustration .",
    "the @xmath6 pure gauge configuration @xmath279 where @xmath280 denotes the usual three - dimensional spherical coordinates , and the configuration may be considered constant in the further space - time coordinate , has the explicit components @xmath281 the full nonabelian field strength of this configuration can easily be verified to vanish @xcite , except on the negative @xmath282-axis - axis , cf .",
    "the pertinent comments in appendix [ idappv ] . ] , i.e. for @xmath283 . there , the dirac string is located . for @xmath284 , @xmath285",
    "can be approximated by @xmath286 and the flux through an infinitesimal wilson loop encircling the dirac string therefore is @xmath287 leading , upon exponentiation , to the trivial value @xmath288 for the wilson loop .",
    "furthermore , by considering the abelian projection @xmath289 of @xmath290 , @xmath291 one obtains in the associated abelian magnetic field @xmath292 a dirac magnetic monopole located at the boundary of the dirac string .",
    "note that in the full field strength , this field is completely canceled by the nonabelian part @xcite , as mentioned above .",
    "thus , magnetic monopoles which become visible in abelian - projected configurations can be used as an alternative way of detecting , or describing , the dirac strings induced by coset gauge fixing .",
    "the above properties imply that a dirac string world - sheet which coincides with a ( oppositely oriented ) patch of a thin @xmath6 vortex world - sheet simply reverses the magnetic flux associated with that patch , leaving all wilson loops invariant . nevertheless , in this way ,",
    "though representing a pure gauge on its own , a dirac string may change what information contained in a configuration is kept during continuum center ( or vortex ) projection , i.e. it can be used to define a different truncation of the theory .",
    "the physical content of the full configurations of course is not influenced by the dirac string .",
    "it should be noted that for higher @xmath3 color groups , the superposition of a dirac string on a vortex changes not only the sign ( i.e. the orientation ) , but in general also the type of vortex flux , i.e. its direction in color space .",
    "e.g. for @xmath155 , one in general additionally exchanges the center flux labels @xmath293 in eq .",
    "( [ su3e ] ) .",
    "this happens precisely in such a way as to leave all wilson loops invariant , as it should be .",
    "thus , due to the possibility of vortex surfaces being partially covered by dirac string world - sheets generated by coset transformations @xmath225 in ( [ mcgc ] ) , vortex surfaces made up of patches of different orientation are automatically generated during continuum center gauge fixing .",
    "vortex projection must merely be generalized to include this additional information about the orientation of vortex magnetic flux resulting from the dirac world - sheets generated by coset gauge fixing .",
    "finally , it should be noted that thick analogues of vortex surfaces consisting of patches of different orientation have been constructed in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "using such generalized objects as approximating configurations @xmath101 in the gauge fixing condition ( [ mcgc ] ) provides another , alternative , way of extracting information about vortex orientation from gauge field configurations .",
    "the center dominance observed for the string tension in lattice monte carlo calculations using the maximal center gauge @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite supports the notion that center vortices are the infrared degrees of freedom relevant for confinement in yang - mills theory . on a formal level , center or",
    "vortex dominance implies that the confinement properties can be adequately described by an effective vortex theory which results by appropriately integrating out all other yang - mills degrees of freedom .",
    "more specifically , in the abovementioned lattice calculations , center dominance is obtained using the full lattice yang - mills dynamics , i.e. the field configurations are sampled according to the full yang - mills action .",
    "center projection is only performed in the observable , i.e. the wilson loop is evaluated using center - projected configurations after maximal center gauge fixing .",
    "thus , in principle , one could evaluate the expectation value of the wilson loop using a @xmath1 effective action obtained after integrating out all coset @xmath2 degrees of freedom . in lattice calculations ,",
    "this separation of the functional integrations is impractical , and the @xmath1 effective action is unknown .    adopting a continuum description does not greatly alleviate this problem , and therefore the following considerations concerning the effective theory of vortices must remain mostly on a formal level .",
    "the intention is to sketch what types of effects may arise in the effective vortex theory particularly in the long - wavelength domain .    to this end , it is necessary to implement a maximal center gauge in the yang - mills functional integral .",
    "this gauge fixing can be decomposed into two steps , as shown in section [ congsec ] , namely coset gauge fixing in an arbitrary fixed thin vortex configuration @xmath101 and optimization of the thin vortex configuration .",

    "the orientation of the vortices , however , is crucial for their topological properties , as will be shown below by evaluating the pontryagin index @xmath322 = \\frac{1}{32\\pi^{2 } } \\int d^4 x \\ ,   \\tilde{f}^{a}_{\\mu \\nu } f^{a}_{\\mu \\nu } =   - \\frac{1}{16\\pi^2 } \\int d^4 x \\ , \\mbox{tr } \\ ,   \\tilde{f}_{\\mu \\nu } f_{\\mu \\nu }   \\label{nudefs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the ideal vortex representation ( [ idvorc ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the treatment in this section , the goal of which is to define the vortex - projected pontryagin index , in some ways reverses the logic of the past sections . whereas the continuum maximal center gauge and also the vortex action were defined via the corresponding lattice expressions in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing ,",
    "the pontryagin index calls for a different treatment .",
    "it is initially defined for smooth continuum gauge field configurations , and useful lattice discretizations of the pontryagin index are notoriously cumbersome .",
    "in fact , the maximal center gauge exacerbates the problem , since all lattice definitions at some point must assume the links of a lattice configuration to be reasonably close to unity . on the other hand",
    ", the maximal center gauge precisely transforms configurations into a form where their links strongly deviate from unity ; namely , it introduces ideal vortices even into initially smooth configurations .",
    "therefore , to properly define the vortex - projected pontryagin index , it is necessary to start from the continuum expression , understanding the pontryagin index for thin ( or , gauge - equivalently , ideal ) vortices to correspond to the thin limit of the pontryagin index of thickened vortices , for which it is well - defined .",
    "this limit is smooth , as is demonstrated in an example in appendix [ appc ] ; namely , the thick vortex profile function manifestly cancels . note",
    "that this concept of vortex projection is not directly connected with lattice center projection anymore , since it is based on the thin limit of thickened ( i.e. coset ) configurations . in the following",

    "the aforementioned example in appendix [ appc ] on the other hand treats a particular configuration of explicitly thick vortices , containing also the limiting case of thin vortices .",

    "a more thorough discussion of the self - intersection number @xmath344 , which is given in appendix [ intseca ] , does , however , not alter the conclusions on the pontryagin index reached here .",
    "thus , the pontryagin index of a vortex surface configuration is built up from its self - intersection points , each of which enters with a contribution @xmath348 into the pontryagin index according to ( [ yidres ] ) .",
    "the integers @xmath349 label the center flux carried by the two patches of the vortex surface configuration intersecting at the point in question ; the sign depends on the relative orientation of the patches . in view of eq .",

    "( [ scprd ] ) and ( [ scpro ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the dependence on the number of colors noted by j.  m.  cornwall in @xcite .    in view of this result",
    ", the reader might worry at this point about the integer - valuedness of the pontryagin index on @xmath353 ( silently compactified to @xmath354 ) .",
    "this property can not go lost during vortex projection , for the very simple reason that vortices can be explicitly represented as gauge field configurations and therefore inherit all properties known to be true for generic gauge fields .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to remark how the integer - valuedness comes about in more detail in a simple case , namely @xmath6 vortices on @xmath353 .",
    "it is due to the fact well - known in topology that the number of intersection points of two closed two - dimensional surfaces in @xmath353 is even .",
    "this also implies that the number of self - intersection points of a closed surface is even , because the self - intersection number is defined by simply intersecting the surface with another surface infinitesimally displaced from it ( i.e. one considers a framing of the surface , cf .",
    "appendix [ intseca ] ) .",
    "thus , while each self - intersection point of an @xmath6 vortex surface configuration gives a contribution @xmath350 to the pontryagin index , the number of such contributions is even , and the pontryagin index integer - valued .    in the case of higher",
    "@xmath3 gauge groups , the argument becomes more complicated , since the surfaces may branch and also due to the fact that superimposed dirac strings in general also modify the type of vortex flux , i.e. its direction in color space .",
    "further complications arise on different space - time manifolds .",
    "for instance , on a four - cube with periodic boundary conditions , i.e. a torus , one might think of generating a single intersection point between two surfaces by choosing e.g. the 1 - 2 plane and the 3 - 4 plane , which are closed due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , this example is invalid , since vortex surfaces must be representable as surfaces of three - volumes , which is not the case for the aforementioned planes .",
    "the final point to be discussed is the fact , also well - known in topology , that the self - intersection number of closed , _ globally oriented _ two - dimensional surfaces in @xmath353 not only is a multiple of four ( remember that each intersection point is counted doubly , and there are an even number of intersection points for closed surfaces ) , but actually vanishes .",
    "this implies that the pontryagin index vanishes for globally oriented vortex surfaces ; conversely , therefore , non - orientedness of the surfaces is crucial for generating a non - vanishing topological winding number . to illustrate this , consider the following three - dimensional slice of two intersecting @xmath6 vortex surfaces in @xmath333 dimensions , cf .",
    "let the one vortex be located entirely within the three - dimensional slice of space - time under consideration ; it is therefore visible as a closed surface , namely the sphere @xmath300 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "let the other vortex extend into the space - time dimension not displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ; it is then visible as a closed loop @xmath89 after slicing .",
    "let @xmath89 intersect @xmath300 at two points , chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] as the poles of @xmath300 .",
    "if @xmath300 and @xmath89 are both globally oriented , as in fig .  [ fig3 ] ( a ) , their intersection number ( in @xmath355 ) @xmath356 vanishes , since the two intersection points occur with opposite relative orientation between the intersecting manifolds .",
    "thus , a non - zero intersection number requires at least one of the two intersecting closed manifolds to be not globally oriented .",
    "globally non - oriented hypersurfaces consist nevertheless of oriented patches .",
    "assume for example the sphere @xmath300 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) to consist of two hemispheres of opposite orientation .",
    "e.g. , the southern hemisphere may be covered by a dirac string world - sheet , simply reversing ( in the case of @xmath6 color ) the orientation associated with that hemisphere .",
    "the boundary of a dirac string world - sheet is complemented by a monopole in the abelian - projected configuration , cf .",
    "( [ dimono ] ) .",
    "thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) , one can associate an abelian monopole current with the equator ( thick line ) . further below",
    ", it will be shown more generally how boundaries of oriented patches on vortex surfaces imply monopole currents .",
    "now , in the presence of the monopole current at the equator in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) , implying a reversal in orientation of , say , the southern hemisphere , the contributions to the pontryagin index from the two intersection points no longer cancel , but add coherently , giving a pontryagin index of modulus @xmath357 .",
    "thus , the depicted configuration represents an analogue of an instanton in the sense that it will generate a zero mode in the dirac operator according to the index theorem .",
    "the authors speculate that standard smoothing procedures used on the lattice to detect instantons would transmute this configuration into an instanton , since smoothing by construction alters configurations such as to lower the yang - mills action . after smoothing ,",
    "it is impossible to discern what type of excitation precisely carried pontryagin index in the original configuration .",
    "note that this picture of the generation of topological winding number also correlates well with the observation @xcite,@xcite that instantons are encircled by monopole loops in the maximal abelian gauge .",
    "it is precisely the monopole loop which tags the change in orientation in the vortex surface ( the sphere @xmath300 in fig .",

    ", one can relate a magnetic flux sheet by associating with it the field strength ( see above ) @xmath359 for a closed surface @xmath164 , this expression agrees with the one for the ideal vortex @xmath201 given in ( [ cloinn ] ) . by stokes theorem",
    ", one finds that a conserved ( abelian ) magnetic current @xmath360 must flow at the boundary @xmath358 of the magnetic sheet @xmath300 .",
    "note that the direction of the magnetic current on @xmath358 defines an orientation of the sheet @xmath300 and vice versa .",
    "this monopole current is generated by a magnetic point charge @xmath361 @xmath362 with @xmath8 denoting the three - volume dual to the loop @xmath89 . in view of @xmath363 , eq .",
    "( [ magq ] ) yields for @xmath361 only a fraction of the elementary magnetic charge dictated by the dirac quantization condition .",
    "this is as it should be , since the vortex sheet @xmath300 only carries a fraction of the flux which a dirac string carries .",
    "only when glueing the open vortex patches with their boundary monopole loops back together , should one take care to obtain current loops of proper magnetic point charges satisfying the dirac quantization condition . in this way ,",
    "non - oriented closed magnetic vortex sheets are constructed , consisting of oriented surface pieces joined by magnetic monopole current loops .",
    "such a non - oriented closed magnetic sheet defines a center vortex which still gives the same contribution to a wilson loop as the corresponding oriented vortex ( in the absence of a monopole loop ) , cf .",
    "( [ wilsid ] ) .",
    "thus , for the confinement properties , measured by the wilson loop , the orientation of a vortex sheet , and hence the magnetic monopole currents , are irrelevant .",
    "the abelian magnetic monopole currents are however necessary in order to generate a non - vanishing pontryagin index for vortex configurations .",
    "it is in fact easy to see that the pontryagin index of the vortices can be determined from the abelian magnetic monopoles alone . indeed , inserting ( [ calfca ] ) into ( [ nudefs ] ) , after a partial integration the pontryagin index of an ideal vortex sheet becomes @xmath364 where gau law was used in the first term and the definition of the magnetic current in the second term .",
    "the second term obviously vanishes in the absence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "furthermore , the surface term vanishes unless the integrand contains singularities which give rise to internal surfaces wrapping the singularities .",
    "such internal surfaces precisely arise in the presence of magnetic charges @xcite which may be magnetic monopoles or more extended magnetic charge distributions such as line or surface charges .",
    "thus , a non - zero pontryagin index requires the existence of magnetic charges in abelian - projected configurations .",
    "this is consistent with the findings in @xcite .",
    "in this work , the continuum analogues of the maximal center gauge and center projection in lattice yang - mills theory were constructed .",
    "this shed new light on the meaning of the procedure on the lattice and led to a sketch of an effective vortex theory in the continuum .",
    "also the manner in which center vortex configurations generate the pontryagin index was clarified ; the latter is built up from self - intersections of the vortex network , where it is crucial that the vortex surfaces be globally non - oriented .",
    "since these developments have already been discussed at length in the corresponding sections above , it suffices here to mention some open issues which require further investigation .    with regard to the maximal center gauge , it is necessary to conduct lattice experiments using alternative gauge fixing functions @xmath21 , cf .",
    "( [ mcgg ] ) , and to test whether the physical conclusions reached using the direct maximal center gauge remain unaffected .",
    "if it is true that maximal center gauges provide a rough localization of thick vortices present in full lattice configurations , then long - distance properties should be robust with respect to a variation of @xmath21 ; fluctuations of the center projection vortices within the thick vortex profile are of course gauge - dependent , as evidenced in section [ examse ] .",
    "an issue which is of particular interest in this context is the occurrence of gribov copies which do not correspond to the absolute maximum of the center gauge fixing functional . in @xcite",
    ", the possibility is raised that the true gauge fixing image selected in particular by the direct maximal center gauge contains less vortices than found in previous studies , and no vortex confinement . as discussed in sections [ revthsec ] and [ dmcgsec ]",
    ", the direct maximal center gauge in the continuum limit in fact always selects a trivial gauge fixing image devoid of center vortices .",
    "the observations of @xcite may be a signature of the specific problems of this particular gauge .",
    "on the other hand , it is straightforward to formulate alternative gauge fixing functions @xmath21 which prevent these problems .",
    "it would be interesting to repeat the considerations of @xcite using such a gauge .",
    "concerning the issue of an effective vortex theory , it was already mentioned in section [ effthsec ] that the authors plan to report on their numerical study of a phenomenological random surface model for vortices in a forthcoming paper . on the other hand , from an analytical point of view",
    ", it would presumably be helpful to start with lower - dimensional models .",
    "e.g. , it would be worthwhile to study whether the maximal center gauge allows a solution of yang - mills theory in @xmath365 space - time dimensions ; there , the effective vortex theory takes the form of a classical statistical mechanics of vortex points .",
    "finally , it is necessary to investigate whether center vortices do in fact fully capture the physics of the pontryagin index ; i.e. one should test whether the vortex - projected pontryagin index displays vortex dominance in analogy to the center dominance observed for the string tension . while it has been shown in this work how vortices generate a nontrivial topological winding number , and the converse experiment in @xcite has shown that an ensemble devoid of center vortices is concentrated in the trivial topological sector , the question of vortex dominance is more stringent . in this context",
    ", it is worth mentioning the analogous result from abelian - projected theories : in the maximal abelian gauge , one finds monopole dominance in the string tension @xcite , but not in the pontryagin index ; on the other hand , in the polyakov gauge , the monopole dominance in the string tension is much less pronounced , but the pontryagin index can be reconstructed exactly from the monopole content of the gauge - fixed configurations alone @xcite .    in connection with the issue of the pontryagin index , of course also a more detailed study of chiral symmetry breaking by a vortex background is called for .",
    "vortex configurations which give rise to a non - vanishing pontryagin index must , by the index theorem , give rise to zero modes of the dirac operator .",
    "it would e.g. be interesting to explicitly construct such zero modes for some relevant simple vortex configurations . in the context of instanton models , the zero modes induced by the instantons give in fact the dominant contribution to the chiral condensate .",
    "the question arises whether the chiral condensate displays vortex dominance ( again , the converse experiment @xcite yields zero condensate in the absence of vortices ) , and , if so , how it behaves at finite temperatures , in particular , at the deconfinement transition .",

    "as long as @xmath377 is arbitrarily large , but fixed with respect to the ultraviolet regulator of the theory , say the inverse lattice spacing , it is legitimate to evaluate the action using the continuum yang - mills expression ( [ g1 ] ) .",
