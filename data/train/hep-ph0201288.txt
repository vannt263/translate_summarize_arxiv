    "parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) parameterize fundamental information on the nonperturbative structure of the nucleon , and the workings of qcd at low energy . over the past two decades considerable",
    "experience has been gained with studies of pdfs within low energy models of the nucleon .",
    "ultimately , however , one would like a more rigorous connection of pdfs with qcd , and presently this can only be provided through the lattice formulation of qcd .    because pdfs are defined as light cone correlation functions , it is not possible to calculate them directly on the lattice in euclidean space . instead , one calculates matrix elements of local twist - two operators , which are related through the operator product expansion to moments of the pdfs . for the spin - averaged quark distributions , @xmath4 ,",
    "the moments are defined as : @xmath5 while moments of the helicity distributions , @xmath6 , are given by : @xmath7 a number of lattice calculations of pdf moments have been performed over the last decade , initially in the quenched approximation , and more recently with dynamical quarks .",
    "the results indicate that at the relatively large quark masses at which the calculations were made ( between @xmath8 and 190  mev ) , the unquenched results are indistinguishable from the quenched within the current errors .    despite the impressive progress of the lattice calculations , for many years the moments @xmath9 have yielded results which were typically @xmath10 larger than the experimental values , when linearly extrapolated to the physical quark masses .",
    "this discrepancy was recently resolved with the observation@xcite that a linear extrapolation in quark mass omits crucial physics associated with the nucleon s pion cloud , and that inclusion of the nonanalytic dependence on the quark mass is essential if one is to reconcile the lattice data with experiment .    in this paper",
    "we report recent progress made in connecting moments of parton distributions calculated on the lattice with experiment , focusing on the extraction of the @xmath1 moments ( which are insensitive to the poorly known disconnected contributions@xcite ) .",
    "we discuss the extraction of the @xmath0 dependence from moments , and the implications for masses of mesons lying on the @xmath2 regge trajectory , and outline the role of chiral symmetry in helicity distributions and the axial vector charge , @xmath3 .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the chiral su(2)@xmath11su(2)@xmath12 symmetry of qcd generates the nearly massless goldstone bosons ( pions ) , whose importance in hadron structure is well documented . at small pion masses , pdf moments can be systematically expanded in a series in @xmath13 , with the expansion coefficients generally free parameters .",
    "one of the unique consequences of pion loops , however , is the appearance of terms nonanalytic in the quark mass , @xmath14 , which arise from the infrared behavior of the chiral loops , and are therefore model independent .",
    "the leading order ( in @xmath13 ) nonanalytic term in the expansion of the moments of pdfs was shown by thomas et al.@xcite to have the generic behavior @xmath15 .",
    "on the other hand , in the heavy quark limit , in which the valence quark distributions become @xmath16-functions centered at @xmath17 , the moments @xmath18 approach @xmath19 . an extrapolation formula which explicitly satisfies both the heavy quark and chiral limits",
    "can be written:@xcite @xmath20 in which the coefficient of the leading nonanalytic ( lna ) term , @xmath21 , is calculated from chiral perturbation theory.@xcite the mass @xmath22 reflects the scale at which the compton wavelength of the pion becomes comparable to the size of the hadron ( without its pion cloud ) .",
    "previous fits@xcite to the lattice moments of @xmath1 suggest a value @xmath23  mev , which is consistent with values found@xcite in analyses of nucleon static properties .",
    "the @xmath24 term in eq .",
    "( [ xtrap ] ) , @xmath25 , is included in order to provide a linear dependence on @xmath26 , and the mass scale @xmath27 is set to be 5  gev for all @xmath28 .    in fig .  1 we show the best @xmath29 fit to the lattice data@xcite for the @xmath30 moment of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath26",
    "clearly , an extrapolation based on eq .",
    "( [ xtrap ] ) provides a much better fit to the lattice data and experiment than a linear fit .",
    "similar results are found@xcite for the @xmath31 and @xmath32 moments .",
    "unfortunately , because all of the lattice data are in a region where the moments show little variation with @xmath26 , it is not possible to determine @xmath22 from the current data , and within the errors both the lattice data and the experimental values can be fitted with @xmath22 ranging from @xmath33 to 700  mev .",
    "data at smaller quark masses are therefore crucial to constrain this parameter and guide an accurate extrapolation .",
    "having established the appropriate way to extrapolate lattice data on pdf moments , one can now ask much information can the existing data provide on the @xmath0 dependence of the pdfs .",
    "the reconstruction of the complete @xmath0 dependence in principle requires infinitely many moments , however , on the lattice , because of operator mixing for operators with spin @xmath34 , all calculations have so far been restricted to @xmath35 .",
    "nevertheless , as shown by detmold et al.,@xcite considerable information on the shape of the valence @xmath36 distribution can already be inferred from just the lowest four moments .",
    "the most efficient way to reconstruct the pdf from a limited number of moments is to determine the parameters of the pdf parameterization by directly fitting to the moments . for the isovector valence distribution accurate pdfs",
    "can be reconstructed from the lowest four moments , using the standard parameterization , @xmath37 where @xmath38 can be related through regge theory to the intercept of the @xmath2 regge trajectory , and @xmath16 is given by perturbative qcd counting rules .",
    "note that some care must be taken when attempting to extract information on valence quark distributions from both the even and odd moments .",
    "while the even @xmath28 moments of @xmath1 correspond to the valence distribution , @xmath36 , the odd @xmath28 moments correspond to the combination @xmath39 .",
    "the difference between these represents the famous violation of the gottfried sum rule .",
    "given sufficiently many moments of @xmath1 , one can reconstruct both the valence @xmath36 and @xmath40 distributions by fitting the even and odd moments separately .",
    "however , at present there exists only a single data point for the even moments , @xmath31 ( the @xmath41 point corresponds to normalization ) , which makes it difficult to obtain accurate information . to minimize the error associated with reconstruction of the @xmath40 distribution",
    ", we subtract the values of the phenomenological moments of @xmath42 from the calculated odd moments .",
    "the correction to the @xmath30 moment is @xmath43 , while for @xmath32 it is a fraction of a percent .",
    "the resulting fits to the moments of the valence @xmath36 distribution are displayed in fig .  2 for both the linear and improved extrapolation , eq .",
    "( [ xtrap ] ) , with the shaded region around the latter corresponding to a 1  @xmath44 variation of the fit parameters from their optimal values .",
    "for clarity we plot @xmath45 times the moments , so that the horizontal line at unity represents the heavy quark limit .",
    "the corresponding distributions @xmath46 are displayed in fig .",
    "once again , the lightly shaded region represents a 1  @xmath44 deviation from the central values , while the darker band illustrates the spread between global pdf fits .",
    "a comparison of the distribution reconstructed using the improved chiral extrapolation with the phenomenological distributions shows reasonably good agreement . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear extrapolation gives a distribution ( scaled by a factor @xmath47 in the figure ) which has a significantly higher peak , centered at @xmath48 , reminiscent of a heavy , constituent quark  like distribution .",
    "according to regge theory , the exponent @xmath38 which governs the small-@xmath0 behavior of the distribution @xmath36 is related to the intercept ( @xmath49 ) of the isovector , @xmath50-odd , @xmath2 regge trajectory , and indeed the best fit@xcite to parameterizations of global data gives @xmath51 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath38 on the quark mass obtained from the fits to moments in sec .  3 therefore allows one to predict the @xmath52 dependence of the regge intercept .",
    "in addition to the intercept , one also needs to determine the slope of the trajectory as a function of @xmath52 . in the infinite mass limit ,",
    "orbital excitations of mesons become energetically degenerate with the @xmath53 state . within regge theory ,",
    "this is possible only if @xmath54 as @xmath55 , which is consistent with the valence distribution approaching a @xmath16-function .",
    "one expects , therefore , that the slope should increase as @xmath52 increases from its physical value . using the lattice data for the @xmath2 meson and the values of @xmath38 generated from the fits in fig .  2",
    ", one can then make predictions for the behavior of the masses of the orbital excitations as a function of @xmath52 .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the predicted @xmath2 regge trajectory at @xmath56  gev , corresponding to the strange quark mass , compared with the trajectory at the physical light quark mass .",
    "a fit through the central values of @xmath38 and the @xmath2 mass@xcite at @xmath56  gev yields a slope which is larger than that of the trajectory at the physical quark mass , consistent with the expected trend towards the heavy quark limit .",
    "although lattice data for the masses of orbital excitations are scarce , there have been some pioneering calculations of the @xmath57 and @xmath58 meson masses by the ukqcd collaboration,@xcite indicated by the filled boxes in fig .  4 ( we use the fact that the @xmath57 trajectory lies on top of the @xmath2 trajectory ) . comparing with the predictions from the pdf analysis ,",
    "the calculated @xmath58 meson mass lies within the predicted band , albeit within large errors , while the @xmath57 mass lies on the edge of the predicted range .",
    "needless to say , further exploration of the masses of excited mesons within lattice qcd would be very helpful in testing these predictions .",
    "lattice simulations of the spin - averaged quark distributions provide one of the benchmark calculations of hadron structure in lattice qcd . having established confidence in the reliability of the lattice calculations through the correct treatment of the chiral behavior of the moments , we can now turn to other pdfs of the nucleon . of particular importance",
    "are the helicity distributions , @xmath59 , which describe the distribution of the nucleon spin amongst its quark constituents .",
    "while a complete determination of the helicity distributions requires calculation of the singlet distribution , @xmath60 , for which there have only been exploratory lattice calculations,@xcite a more basic challenge remains to understand the axial vector charge , @xmath3 , given by the @xmath41 moment of the isovector @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the results of several lattice calculations@xcite of @xmath3 are compiled in fig .",
    "not included are results from recent simulations using domain wall fermions,@xcite which appear to have strong finite volume dependence ",
    "see below . )",
    "when extrapolated linearly in @xmath52 to the physical quark mass , the results are @xmath6115% lower than the experimental value .",
    "simulations with dynamical fermions@xcite ( sesam ) yield results consistent with the earlier unquenched calculations@xcite .    on the other hand , the behavior of the moments @xmath62 is known in the chiral@xcite and heavy quark limits , and can be used to constrain the extrapolation form , as in eq .",
    "( [ xtrap ] ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "using the same values of @xmath22 and @xmath27 as in fig .  1 , the results of the chiral extrapolation using eq .  ( [ xtrap_ga ] )",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "the result for @xmath3 is a downturn with decreasing @xmath52 , making the discrepancy with the empirical value larger .",
    "the reasons for this could be severalfold .",
    "firstly , the chiral behavior in eq .",
    "( [ xtrap_ga ] ) arises only from fluctuations @xmath66 , whereas it is well known that the @xmath67 plays an important role in @xmath3 through the fluctuation @xmath68 . on the other hand , in the chiral limit",
    "the @xmath67 has been shown@xcite to give vanishing chiral contributions at order @xmath15 , suggesting that higher order effects in the chiral expansion are likely to be important .",
    "the inclusion of these effects is currently under investigation .",
    "more importantly , perhaps , to fully incorporate the pion cloud in a lattice simulation a sufficiently large volume must be used . indeed",
    ", there are some indications@xcite of large finite volume effects for @xmath3 , which tend to _ increase _ @xmath3 in comparison with the results from smaller volumes .",
    "clearly , in light of the results on the chiral extrapolation , it is imperative to perform simulations on larger lattices to understand the source of the discrepancy .",
    "in this report we have highlighted the importance of model independent constraints from the chiral and heavy quark limits of qcd in the extrapolation of lattice data on parton distribution moments .",
    "inclusion of the nonanalytic structure associated with the infrared behavior of goldstone boson loops leads to a resolution of a long - standing discrepancy between lattice data on low moments of the spin - averaged @xmath1 distribution and experiment .",
    "the importance of ensuring the correct chiral behavior is further illustrated by comparing the @xmath0 distributions obtained by extrapolating the lattice data using a linear and a chirally symmetric fit . while the latter gives an @xmath0 distribution which is in quite good agreement with the phenomenological fits , the linearly extrapolated data give distributions with the wrong small-@xmath0 behavior , which translates into a much more pronounced peak at @xmath48 , reminiscent of a heavy , constituent quark  like distribution .",
    "our analysis suggests an intriguing connection between the small-@xmath0 behavior of the valence distributions and the @xmath52 dependence of meson masses on regge trajectories , which should be tested more thoroughly in future simulations of the excited hadron spectrum .",
    "finally , we have highlighted the need for further study of moments of the helicity distributions , and the axial vector charge of the nucleon in particular , which appears to be underestimated in lattice simulations .",
    "the inclusion of the pion cloud of the nucleon leads to a larger discrepancy at the physical quark mass , indicating that lattice artifacts such as finite volume effects may not yet be under control .",
    "further data on larger lattices , and at smaller quark masses , will be necessary to resolve this issue .",
