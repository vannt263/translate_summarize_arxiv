    "accretion processes involve the non - self - gravitating flow dynamics of astrophysical matter under the external gravitational influence of a massive astrophysical object , like an ordinary star or a compact object  @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic model of an astrophysical accreting system is that of spherically symmetric infall on to a central accretor . ever since the seminal work published by  @xcite , which effectively launched the subject in the form in which it is recognised today , the problem of spherically symmetric flows has been revisited time and again from various angles  @xcite .",
    "this abiding appeal of the spherically symmetric model is explained by the fact that almost always it lends itself to an exact mathematical analysis , and in the process it allows a very clear insight to be had into the underlying physical principles .",
    "ease of mathematical manipulations , however , is not the only reason why spherically symmetric flows are regularly invoked in accretion - related literature .",
    "the details of the physics of many astrophysical flows are , in fact , very faithfully described and understood with the help of this relatively simple model .",
    "accretion of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a case in point .    while formal fluid dynamical equations in the newtonian construct of space and time",
    " which would involve a momentum balance equation ( with gravity as an external driving force ) , the continuity equation and an equation of state  suffice to a great extent in shedding light on the accretion of the ism , it must at the same time be recognised that the ism is not entirely to be seen as a fluid continuum .",
    "in fact , for many purposes essential to grasping the underlying details , the ism is believed to possess a self - similar hierarchical structure over several orders of magnitude in scale  @xcite . direct h  i absorption observations and interstellar scintillation measurements suggest that the structure extends down to a scale of @xmath0  @xcite and possibly even to sub-@xmath1 scales  @xcite .",
    "numerous theories have attempted to explain the origin , evolution and mass distribution of these clouds and it has been established , from both observations  @xcite and numerical simulations  @xcite , that the interstellar medium has a clumpy hierarchical self - similar structure with a fractal dimension in three - dimensional space .",
    "the main reason for this is still not properly understood , but it can be the consequence of an underlying fractal geometry that may arise due to turbulent processes in the medium",
    ".    a theoretical study of these astrophysical systems  either a fluid continuum or a fractal structure  will necessitate the application of the mathematical principles of nonlinear dynamics .",
    "this is the principal objective of this work .",
    "the physical processes in a fractal medium have been analysed by fractional integration and differentiation  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to do so , the fractal medium has had to be replaced by a continuous medium and the integrals on the network of the fractal medium has had to be approximated by fractional integrals  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of fractional integration is connected with fractional mass dimension  @xcite .",
    "fractional integrals can be considered as integrals over fractional dimension space within a numerical factor  @xcite .",
    "this numerical factor has been chosen suitably to get the right dimension of any physical parameter and to derive the standard expression in the continuum limit .",
    "the isotropic and homogeneous nature of dimensionality has also been incorporated properly .",
    "all of these will give a self - consistent description of the hydrodynamics in a fractal medium  @xcite .",
    "once the hydrodynamic equivalence has been established , it has then been a fairly easy exercise to model the steady fractal flow like a simple first - order autonomous dynamical system  @xcite .",
    "this has made it possible to gain an understanding of the critical aspects of the stationary phase portrait of the fractal flow , especially the behaviour of the transonic solution .",
    "the critical point in the phase portrait has been shown to be a saddle point , and the transonic solution that has to pass through this point has been shown to be infinitely sensitive to the choice of a boundary condition . while this bodes ill for the feasibility of transonicity itself within the stationary framework , all steady global solutions ( transonic or otherwise ) have been found to be stable under a time - dependent linearised perturbation .",
    "an interesting fact that has come to light is that the necessary mathematical conditions , which include an equation of motion for the dynamic perturbation and its relevant boundary conditions , to argue for the stability of the steady fractal flows , have been found to be entirely identical to what has been reported earlier regarding the stability of continuous spherically symmetric inflows  @xcite .",
    "this similarity is fortunate and armed with this knowledge , it can be safely claimed that fractal flows are just as stable as continuous flows under the effects of small linearised perturbations .",
    "having said this , one will still have to confront the fact that the time - dependent perturbative analysis has done nothing to indicate the primacy of the transonic solution , and that the steady transonic inflow solution would not be possible without an infinite precision in prescribing a proper boundary condition .",
    "this obstacle has , however , been overcome by taking into consideration explicit dynamics in the flow system , and then evolving a physical flow through time , after having started with appropriate initial conditions .",
    "transonicity becomes evident very soon , and it has been argued with a simplified analytical model in the  pressure - free \" limit , that the guiding physical criterion to select the transonic solution is the one forwarded by  @xcite , i.e. the transonic solution will be chosen because it corresponds to a minimum energy configuration . while the  pressure - free \" limit does not involve the fractal properties directly , it has been demonstrated through a numerical integration of the dynamic flow equations of the fractal medium that transonicity is very much the favoured mode of infall in this case too . and the most salient result to have emerged from this numerical study",
    "has been that transonic features becomes more pronounced , as the medium is more like a fractal .",
    "it has already been mentioned that the perturbative treatment has been shown to give no clear - cut evidence to favour transonicity .",
    "support for transonicity , however , has come indirectly from the perturbative angle too .",
    "the equation of motion for the propagation of the linearised perturbation has been shown to have subtle similarities with an equation implying the metric of an acoustic black hole  @xcite .",
    "this hints at the fact that matter might cross the sonic horizon at the greatest possible rate , i.e. transonically , just as matter has to cross the event horizon of a black hole maximally .",
    "considering the existence of a medium that has a fractal structure of mass dimensionality @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 ) embedded in a 3-dimensional space , the mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath4 can be written as  @xcite @xmath5 with @xmath6 referring to the dimension , @xmath7 to the constant density of the medium , and @xmath8 to a characteristic inner length of the medium that can take an arbitrary value in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "this is the scale below which the medium will be continuous .",
    "the fractional integrals are computed as integrals over fractional dimension space within a numerical factor .",
    "the fractional infinitesimal length for a medium with isotropic mass dimension will , therefore , be given by  @xcite @xmath10 with the constant having been chosen to derive the standard expression in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "it is to be noted that the infinitesimal area and volume elements in this `` fractional continuous '' medium of mass dimension @xmath2 will be different , and hence the mass enclosed in a sphere of radius @xmath4 for constant density @xmath7 will be  @xcite @xmath12    in this medium the inviscid euler equation , describing the dynamics of the velocity field , @xmath13 , can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gravitational potential of the central accretor that drives the flow ( with the prime denoting the spatial derivative of the potential ) .",
    "this is a local conservation law and , as it is to be expected , this has exactly the same form as that of the equation for the continuous medium . in the case of stellar accretion ,",
    "the flow is driven by the newtonian potential , @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , frequently in studies of black hole accretion , it becomes convenient to dispense completely with the rigour of general relativity , and instead make use of an `` effective '' pseudo - newtonian potential that will imitate general relativistic effects in the newtonian construct of space and time  @xcite .",
    "the choice of a particular form of the potential will not affect the general arguments overmuch .",
    "the pressure , @xmath17 , is related to the local density , @xmath7 , through a polytropic equation of state @xmath18 , in which @xmath19 is a constant , and @xmath20 is the polytropic exponent , whose admissible range is given by @xmath21 .",
    "this range is restricted by the isothermal and the adiabatic limits , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of @xmath7 is described by the equation of continuity  @xcite , @xmath22 in which @xmath23 .    the flow system will , therefore , be specified by equations  ( [ euler ] ) and  ( [ con ] ) , along with the polytropic equation of state . of particular interest",
    "are the steady state solutions for the case where the fractal medium is at rest at a large distance from the accretor .",
    "since transonic flows are of primary concern here , it is required that the static flow should evolve from @xmath24 as @xmath25 ( the outer boundary condition ) to @xmath26 for small @xmath4 , where @xmath27 is the speed of sound , given by @xmath28 .",
    "the stationary state implies @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , equations  ( [ euler ] ) and  ( [ con ] ) will be reduced to their steady state forms as @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "it is easily seen that equations  ( [ stateuler ] ) and  ( [ statcon ] ) remain invariant under the transformation @xmath32 , i.e. the mathematical problem for inflows ( @xmath33 ) and outflows ( @xmath34 ) is identical in the stationary state  @xcite .     ]",
    "it is in principle possible to eliminate either @xmath13 or @xmath7 and solve for the other variable as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "however , adopting a slightly different approach , it is possible to recast equations  ( [ stateuler ] ) and  ( [ statcon ] ) in a combined form as @xmath35 ,   \\label{dvdr}\\ ] ] whose integral solutions have been shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , with @xmath36 , and with the vertical axis scaled by the absolute value of the mach number , @xmath37 .",
    "the two continuous curves labelled  a \" and  w \" refer to accretion and wind , respectively .",
    "the critical points in the flow will be derived from the standard requirement that the flow solutions will have a finite gradient when they will cross the sonic horizon ( where the bulk flow velocity exactly matches the speed of acoustic propagation ) , which will mean that both the numerator and the denominator of equation  ( [ dvdr ] ) will have to vanish simultaneously and non - trivially  @xcite .",
    "this can only happen when @xmath38 which gives the critical point ( or the sonic point in this particular case ) conditions , with the subscript ",
    "@xmath39 \" labelling the critical point values .",
    "it is not a difficult exercise to integrate equation  ( [ stateuler ] ) and then transform the variable @xmath7 in it to @xmath27 with the help of the equation of state .",
    "this , with the critical point conditions as given by equation  ( [ critcon1 ] ) , will give a relation for fixing the critical point coordinates in terms of the flow parameters , @xmath40 ( which is actually bernoulli s constant ) , @xmath41 and @xmath20 as @xmath42 the form of @xmath15 will obviously determine the number of the critical points , and for the newtonian potential only one root of @xmath43 will be obtained from equation  ( [ eulerfix ] ) .",
    "this root , for @xmath40 fixed by the outer boundary condition of the transonic inflow solution , will be given as @xmath44 \\frac{gm}{a_\\infty^2 } ,   \\label{rcrit}\\ ] ] with @xmath45 being the speed of sound at the outer boundary of the flow  @xcite , where the influence of gravity is negligibly weak .",
    "it should be worth mentioning here that although with the choice of a pseudo - newtonian potential multiple roots for @xmath43 would result , practically speaking only one of these roots would be a physically meaningful critical point , through which an integral solution may pass . for spherically symmetric flows in the general relativistic framework ,",
    "this issue has been discussed by  @xcite .",
    "so far the flow variables have been ascertained only at the critical points .",
    "since the flow equations are in general nonlinear differential equations , short of carrying out a numerical integration , there is no completely rigorous analytical prescription for solving these differential equations to determine the global nature of the flow variables .",
    "nevertheless , some analytical headway could be made after all by taking advantage of the fact that equation  ( [ dvdr ] ) , which gives a complete description of the @xmath4  @xmath46 phase portrait of the flow , is an autonomous first - order differential equation , and as such , could easily be recast into the mathematical form @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which is that of the very familiar coupled first - order dynamical system  @xcite .",
    "quite frequently for any nonlinear physical system , a linearised analytical study of the properties of the fixed points of a first - order dynamical system , affords a robust platform for carrying out an investigation to understand the global behaviour of integral solutions in the phase portrait .",
    "and so it is that to investigate the nature of the critical point , equation  ( [ dvdr ] ) will have to be decomposed in terms of a mathematical parameter , @xmath49 , to read as @xmath50   \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{{\\mathrm",

    "this kind of parametrization is quite common in fluid dynamics  @xcite , and in accretion studies especially , this approach has been made before  @xcite",
    ". some earlier works in accretion had also made use of the general mathematical aspects of this approach  @xcite . a further point that has to be noted",
    "is that the function @xmath51 in the right hand side of equation  ( [ dynsys ] ) can be expressed entirely in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath4 , with the help of the equation of state and equation  ( [ statcon ] ) .",
    "this will exactly satisfy the criterion of a first - order autonomous dynamical system .",
    "the next task would be to make a linearised approximation about the fixed point coordinates and extract a linear dynamical system out of equations  ( [ dynsys ] ) .",

    "\\label{neigen}\\ ] ] for the values of @xmath20 and @xmath41 lying in the range of physical interest , it can always be shown that @xmath67 .",
    "hence in this case the critical point is a saddle point , and the curves which have been labelled  accretion \" and  wind \" in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] are in fact separatrices of a dynamical system , rather than physical solutions .",
    "the understand the full import of this line of reasoning , what has to be borne in mind is that saddle points are inherently unstable , and to make a solution pass through such a point , after starting from an outer boundary condition , will entail an infinitely precise fine - tuning of that boundary condition  @xcite .",
    "this can be demonstrated through simple arguments .",
    "going back to equations  ( [ lindyn ] ) , the coupled set of linear differential equations in @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be set down as @xmath68 in which the constant coefficients @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are to be determined simply by an inspection of equations  ( [ lindyn ] ) .",
    "it is also to be easily seen that @xmath73 .",
    "this makes the integration of equation  ( [ ratio ] ) a straightforward exercise , and it yields @xmath74 with @xmath75 being an integration constant . generally speaking equation  ( [ hyper ] ) is the equation of a conic section in the @xmath56  @xmath55 plane . if the origin of this plane were to be considered to have been shifted to the saddle point , then the condition for solutions passing through the origin , i.e. @xmath76 , would be @xmath77 , which would reduce equation  ( [ hyper ] ) to a pair of straight lines intersecting each other through the origin itself .",
    "all other solutions in the vicinity of the origin will , therefore , be hyperbolic in nature , a fact that is given by the condition @xmath78 .",
    "for the case of @xmath16 , this contention can be verified completely analytically , and this shows that even a very minute deviation from a precise boundary condition for transonicity ( i.e. a boundary condition that will generate solutions to pass _ only _ through the origin , @xmath76 ) will take the stationary solution far away from a transonic state .",
    "this extreme sensitivity of transonic solutions to boundary conditions is entirely in keeping with the nature of saddle points .",
    "it may be imagined that in a proper astrophysical system such precise fulfillment of a boundary condition will make the transonic solution well - nigh physically non - realisable .",
    "indeed , this difficulty , for any kind of accreting system , is readily appreciated by anyone trying to carry out a numerical integration of equation  ( [ dvdr ] ) to generate the transonic solutions , which can only be obtained when the numerics is first biased in favour of transonicity by using the saddle point condition itself as the boundary condition for numerical integration .    apart from this , there is also a mathematical aspect of the physical non - realisability of transonic solutions .",
    "using the condition @xmath77 will make it easy to express @xmath55 in terms of @xmath56 and vice versa .",
    "going back to the set of linear equations given by equations  ( [ lindyn ] ) and choosing the second one of the two equations ( the choice of the first would also have led to the same result ) , one gets @xmath79 which can be integrated for both the roots from an arbitrary initial value of @xmath80 lying anywhere on the transonic solution , to a point @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being very close to the critical point given by @xmath83 . using the equivalence that @xmath84 , it can be shown that @xmath85 from which it is easy to see that @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that the critical point may be reached along either of the separatrices , only after @xmath88 has become infinitely large .",
    "this divergence of the parameter @xmath49 indicates that in the stationary regime , solutions passing through the saddle point are not actual solutions , but separatrices of various classes of solutions  @xcite .",
    "this fact , coupled with the sensitivity of the stationary transonic solutions to the choice of an outer boundary condition , makes their feasibility a seriously questionable matter .",
    "it has been demonstrated in the foregoing section that the steady transonic accretion solution is unstable under infinitesimal deviations from the precise outer boundary condition needed to generate the solution . in the astrophysical context ,",
    "such precision is quite impossible , and , therefore , the very feasibility of transonicity becomes a matter of grave doubt .",
    "this difficulty can , however , be dispelled if one is mindful of the fact that the real astrophysical flow is not static but dynamic in character , i.e. it will have an explicit dependence on time .",
    "this , of course , will mean that the time - dependent terms involving both the velocity and the density fields in equations  ( [ euler ] ) and  ( [ con ] ) will have to be retained .    while full - fledged time - dependence of the flow variables will undoubtedly reveal many new interesting mathematical facets ( all of them involving the mathematics of partial differential equations ) of the physical problem",
    ", it would still be worthwhile to go back to studying the properties of the background stationary flow under the influence of a linearised perturbative effect . as a preliminary exercise in accounting for explicit time - dependence , this will at least shed some light on the global stability of the flow solutions .    to that end , it will first be necessary to define , closely following a perturbative procedure prescribed by  @xcite and  @xcite , a new physical variable @xmath89 .",

    "arguments regarding stability will , therefore , be more dependent on the boundary conditions of the steady flow . as the form of the equation of motion for the linearised perturbation remains unchanged even for a flow in a fractal medium , and",

    "is given by the condition , @xmath133 , with @xmath90 being an arbitrary function , whose form is to be determined from the initial condition .",
    "the general solution can , therefore , be set down as @xmath134 ,   \\label{gensol2}\\ ] ] to determine whose particular form , the initial condition that will have to be used is @xmath135 at @xmath122 for all @xmath4 .",
    "this will lead to @xmath136 from which it is easy to see that for @xmath137 , what is approached is the stationary solution , @xmath138 corresponding to the given initial condition , this is evidently the stationary solution associated with the lowest possible total energy , and the temporal evolution selects this solution from among all the others .",
    "the whole picture could be conceived of as one in which a system with a uniform velocity distribution @xmath135 everywhere , suddenly has a gravity mechanism switched on in its midst at @xmath122 .",
    "this induces a potential @xmath139 at all points in space .",
    "the system then starts evolving to restore itself to another stationary state , with the velocity increasing according to equation  ( [ partform ] ) , so that for @xmath137 , the total energy at all points , @xmath140 , remains the same as at @xmath122 .     ]     ]     ]    this contention has been borne out by a numerical integration of equation  ( [ presfree ] ) by the finite differencing technique .",
    "the mass of the accretor has been chosen to be @xmath141 , while its radius is @xmath142 .",
    "the evolution through time has been followed at a fixed length scale of @xmath143 .",
    "the result of the numerical evolution of the velocity field , @xmath144 ( for inflows @xmath13 is actually negative ) , through time , @xmath103 , has been plotted in fig .",
    "the limiting value of the velocity , as the evolution progresses towards the long - time limit , is evidently @xmath145 ( with @xmath146 and @xmath147 ) , as equation  ( [ statsol ] ) would suggest .",
    "this is what the plot in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows , as @xmath144 approaches its terminal value for @xmath137 .",
    "the slope of this logarithmic plot also indicates that in the early stages of the evolution there is a linear growth of the velocity field through time , but on later times , conspicuous deviation from linearity sets in .    the argument presented above , with the effects of pressure taken into account ,",
    "can now be extended to understand the dynamic selection of the transonic solution .",
    "the inclusion of the pressure term in the dynamic equation , fixes the total energy of the system accordingly at @xmath122 .",
    "a physically realistic initial condition should be that @xmath135 at @xmath122 , for all @xmath4 , while @xmath7 has some uniform value .",
    "the temporal evolution of the accreting system would then non - perturbatively select the transonic trajectory , as it is this solution with which is associated the least possible energy configuration .",
    "this argument is in conformity with the assertion made by  @xcite that it is the criterion of minimum total energy that should make a particular solution ( the transonic solution in this case ) preferred to all the others .",
    "however , this selection mechanism is effective only through the temporal evolution of the flow .    to test this contention",
    "a numerical study has been carried out once again using finite differencing , but this time using both the dynamic equations for the velocity and the density fields , as given by equations  ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ con ] ) .",
    "the accretor has been chosen to have a mass , @xmath141 , and radius , @xmath142 .",
    "the  ambient \" conditions are @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the polytropic exponent , @xmath20 , has been set as @xmath150 .",
    "for these values of the physical constants , transonicity becomes apparent even at the very early stages of the evolution .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] in which the velocity field ( scaled as the mach number ) has been plotted after it has evolved for @xmath151 seconds .",
    "the horizontal distance has been scaled by the sonic radius ( which , going by equation  ( [ rcrit ] ) , effectively makes this scaling dependent on the fractal dimension ) , and it shows a saturation behaviour for the inflow velocity at smaller length scales .",
    "this saturation scale for the velocity field is roughly the same for any value of @xmath152 , although at larger length scales , a curve placed higher in the plot , corresponds to a higher value of @xmath152 . besides this ,",
    "all curves , as it is apparent from the slope of each of them , display the same kind of power - law behaviour on larger length scales .",
    "all this is somewhat reminiscent of the growth processes exhibited by the ballistic deposition model , which is applied to generate a nonequilibrium interface  @xcite .",
    "the comparative properties of the velocity field , at smaller length scales , for various values of @xmath152 , have been exhibited in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] . here",
    "the radial distance has been scaled in terms of the radius of the accretor , which in this case is @xmath142 .",
    "what is interesting to note in this plot is that for all other conditions remaining the same , on length scales close to the accretor , solutions corresponding to lower values of the fractal dimension , @xmath152 , grow faster in time than solutions with higher values of @xmath152 .",
    "it is possible to argue that this is exactly how it should be . the pressure of the infalling gas , in so far as it is connected to the density through a polytropic equation of state , builds up resistance against gravity , because of the growth of the density field on small length scales .",
    "transonicity can only be achieved when gravity wins over pressure on length scales smaller than the sonic radius .",
    "this will be all the more true near the accretor , where the velocity field will evolve under free - fall conditions , and , therefore , the more dilute the gas , the more efficient will be the drive towards the transonic state .",
    "now a fractal medium may be viewed equivalently as a continuum with an effective lesser density . in this situation",
    "a system with a lesser value of @xmath152 will be more prone to losing against gravity than a system with higher value of @xmath152 , and so the race towards transonicity will be more successful as @xmath152 decreases .",
    "it is exactly this state of affairs that fig .",
    "[ f4 ] graphically represents .",
    "an earlier work reported by  @xcite was carried out under the implicit assumption that the accretion process would take place transonically .",
    "the present treatment bears out this assumption self - consistently .",
    "it was also discussed by  @xcite that the rate of accretion in a fractal medium can vary significantly from the  @xcite rate for more massive accretors .",
    "this is very much in conformity with the conclusions derived in this work , through the numerical evolution of transonicity , and it would be judicious to account for this fact , while studying the accretion of a fractal medium on to a black hole .",
    "black hole accretion is necessarily transonic  @xcite , but even for accretion from a molecular cloud on to a star , in the absence of any inner boundary condition being imposed on the flow , the flow is expected to be transonic  @xcite . therefore , whatever be the nature of the accretor , both transonicity and the quantitative modifications arising due to the fractal nature of the accreting medium , will be very much relevant for studies in spherically symmetric accretion .",
    "it has also been discussed here that transonic properties manifest themselves more noticeably with an increase in the fractal properties of the flow .",
    "the dynamic evolution has shown that the growth rate of the velocity field ( as scaled against the speed of acoustic propagation ) becomes significantly higher in this case .",
    "this , of course , will have a direct bearing on the mass accretion rate , and it is worth conjecturing that there might be some observational evidence for this kind of behaviour .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .",
    "the authors express gratitude to j. k. bhattacharjee , j. n. chengalur , t. naskar and r. nityananda for much encouragement and many helpful comments ."
