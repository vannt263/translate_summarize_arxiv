    "understanding the origin , propagation and fate of solar high energy electrons is an important topic in solar and space physics ; it is such particles that present a danger to spacecraft and astronauts in low earth orbit .",
    "these particles also carry diagnostic information that may teach us about acceleration processes elsewhere in the heliosphere and throughout the universe .",
    "non - thermal particles can be detected via their x - ray or gamma ray emission when interacting in the chromosphere or lower solar corona , by their radio emission in the solar corona and inner heliosphere , or directly in situ in interplanetary space .    to date , the state of the art in solar hard x - ray ( hxr ) imaging has been the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi , _ * ? ? ? * ) , which uses rotation modulation collimators to indirectly image the sun .",
    "this requires detectors with large collecting areas and can provide high ( @xmath12@xmath2 ) angular resolution but is limited by both the detector background and by the nature of the fourier imaging technique itself .",
    "in contrast , focused imaging of the sun has been the standard in solar soft x - ray imaging for decades with detailed and dynamic images returned by the soft x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on _ hinode _",

    "* )    here we present the first focused hard x - ray images of the sun from the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which observes the sky from 3 to 79 kev with focusing optics whose point - spread function ( psf ) has a half - power diameter ( hpd ) of @xmath160@xmath2 .",
    "_ nustar s _ primary science goals concern supernovae , black holes , and pulsars , but , unlike virtually every other high energy astrophysics mission to date , it is capable of being pointed at the sun , observing a @xmath3 patch of the solar disk at a time . moving to focusing optics probes a completely different observing regime than has been previously possible with _ rhessi_.    to compare the performance of _ nustar _ and _ rhessi _ we construct a figure of merit ( fom ) that contrasts the capabilities of the two different technologies by comparing the background to the effective area of each instrument over the the energy range relevant for faint solar flares ( 415 kev ) . in this range",
    "the _ nustar _ average effective area ( 600 @xmath4 for both telescopes combined ) is over ten times the _ rhessi _ average effective area ( 45.6 @xmath4 for 8 _ rhessi _ detector modules ) . even more importantly ,",
    "the background for the _ nustar _ detectors ( 8@xmath5 cts sec@xmath6 ) is down by over four orders magnitude compared to the _ rhessi _ background ( 54 cts sec@xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this results in a fom for _ nustar _",
    "( 1.3@xmath7 cts sec@xmath6 @xmath8 ) roughly a million times lower than the comparable fom for _ rhessi _ ( 1.2 cts sec@xmath6 @xmath8 ) , meaning a flare giving the same count rate as the background is a million times fainter for _ nustar _ than for _ rhessi_. while interpreting this fom in terms of the sensitivity of the two fundamentally different types of instruments is far from trivial , this does demonstrate the power of focusing optics .",
    "there are , however , technical challenges during solar observations that must be met to realize any increases in sensitivity .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "readout electronics were not specifically designed to handle the extreme count rates produced by the sun ( which can be several orders of magnitude brighter than the astrophysical sources observed by _ nustar _ ) and so can not directly observe bright solar flares as _",
    "rhessi _ does .",
    "this means that _ nustar _ will complement the existing solar observatories , extending the observations in the hard x - ray band to fainter sources and opening the door to a new exploration space of hard x - ray observations of the sun .",

    "kev the field - of - view ( fov ) of _ nustar _ is defined by the physical size of the detectors .",
    "this produces a fov of roughly 12@xmath9x12@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the point spread functions ( psf ) of the optics have a full - width half maximum of 18@xmath2 and a half - power diameter of 60@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "though _ nustar _ was designed as an astrophysics observatory , it also has the capability of directly observing the sun without any harm to the telescope optics and only a negligible degradation of the angular resolution of the instrument . while _",
    "nustar _ is well calibrated over the 379 kev bandpass @xcite , the lower energy bound can be extended to energies as low as 2.5 kev if there is sufficient flux present ( see appendix [ sec : low_energy ] ) .    there are , however , several technical issues encountered when using",
    "_ nustar _ as a solar observatory .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "optics are based on a wolter - i conical approximation , which is a grazing incidence , double mirror system .",
    "a properly focused photon will reflect twice off the optics before exiting . however , it is possible for a photon to reflect only once off of either the upper conical section or the lower conical section , which we refer to as a  ghost ray \" .",
    "the pattern of ghost rays on the focal plane is very distinct as shown in figure 2 of @xcite and the left panel of figure [ fig : ghostrays ] .",
    "on the sun there can be several bright sources ( e.g. active regions ) on the solar disk but outside the fov that can result in a complex observed pattern of overlapping ghost ray images .",
    "this is especially problematic when an extremely bright source ( e.g. a bright active region or a flaring region of the sun ) is just outside of the field of view .",
    "however , as we show in appendix [ sec : ghostrays ] , ghost rays primarily result in an elevated background in the fov and can be avoided by observing the sun when no ( or few ) bright active regions are present on the solar disk .",
    "another consideration is the throughput of the _ nustar _ focal plane detector electronics . unlike a soft x - ray or optical ccds , the _",
    "detectors are not  clocked \" at a given frame rate .",
    "instead they are photon counting devices and respond to a trigger ( e.g. a photon hitting the focal plane ) .",
    "the readout time for each photon arriving at the detector is 2.5 ms @xcite during which time the focal plane can not respond to a subsequently arriving photon .",
    "this can generally be described as a non - paralyzable deadtime per event of 2.5 ms @xcite and results in a throughput that asymptotes toward a maximum of 400 counts per second per telescope as the incident count rate increases . in practice",
    "this can mean that fainter secondary spectral components ( e.g. hot plasma from above an active region or non - thermal emissions from accelerated electrons ) may produce small numbers of observed counts and be hard to detect in the presence of other hxr sources ( e.g. emission from the active region itself or ghost rays from sources outside of the field of view ) .",
    "fortunately , the event shaping time is short for the _ nustar _ detectors so there may not be significant pile - up effects even for the extreme count rates encountered when observing the sun",
    ". see appendix [ sec : pileup ] for further discussion of potential pile - up and steps that can be taken to mitigate pile - up in the solar observations .",
    "we reduce the _ nustar _ solar data with the _ nustar _ data analysis software ( nustardas ) version 1.4.1 and _ nustar _ caldb version 20150414 . to limit the number of solar photons that are inadvertantly vetoed in the post - processing software we disabled some of the standard filtering that is used by the nustardas pipeline .",
    "these filters are used to remove sources of electronic background noise ( see the _ nustar _ software user s guide for more information ) . to accomplish this",
    "we run the pipeline with the status expression status==b0000xx00xx0xx000 and then remove obviously noisy pixels in post - processing .      for the solar observations we use the  science_sc",
    "\" observing mode .",
    "this differs from the standard `` science '' mode used for astrophysical sources in that it uses the aspect solution derived by the spacecraft bus ( satellite ) rather than the instrument star tracker to project a photon onto the sky ( hereafter :  reconstructing \" the photon ) .",
    "this mode is automatically used when the instrument star tracker is blinded by a bright target ( e.g. the bright earth limb , the moon , or the sun ) .",
    "the spacecraft bus uses three star trackers to determine its orientation .",
    "these are pointed in roughly orthogonal directions so that at any particular moment there are combinations of one , two , or three star trackers ( also know as camera head units , or chus ) that can be used to determine the aspect solution .",
    "our absolute knowledge of the alignment of the star trackers is limited by thermal motions in the spacecraft itself .",
    "this results in a point source reconstructed using a certain combination of star trackers to appear to be shifted by an arcminute or two in ra / dec coordinates compared to the same point source reconstructed using a different combination of star trackers .",
    "this relative shift can be removed empirically if a bright source is present in the field of view ( fov ) and the two combinations can be registered against one another .",
    "the absolute ra / dec position can be adjusted if a point source has a known position ( e.g. for isolated astrophysical sources ) or if the image can be registered against other observations in different wavebands ( e.g. using _ solar dynamics observatory _ ) .",
    "we convert the ra / dec images to heliocentric coordinates by using the jpl horizons online ephemeris tool @xcite to generate the ephemeris ( ra / dec positions ) for the center of the sun and the angle between the solar north pole and celestial north .",
    "we interpolate the ra / dec heliocentric coordinates onto the arrival times for each of the  counts and compute a differential offset ( in arcseconds from the sun center ) in ra and dec before applying a rotation to heliocentric coordinates .",
    "a final empirical offset can also be applied by aligning the  images with some other heliocentric images ( e.g. aia images from _ solar dynamics observatory _ ) for each chu combination .",

    ".      the most direct knowledge about electron acceleration during solar flares , including the associated heating processes , is based on hxr observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . through the bremsstrahlung mechanism ,",
    "hxrs provide diagnostics of hot thermal flare plasmas ( typically 10 - 50 mk ) and flare accelerated electrons ( with energies above @xmath110 kev ) .",
    "solar flare hxr spectra steeply decrease with photon energy , making it challenging to observe the full spectrum .",
    "below ( typically ) 1020 kev , thermal emission from heated plasma in coronal loops dominates non - thermal emission from the footpoints and the coronal acceleration site , and generally dominates the overall count rate at all energies .",
    "_ rhessi _ uses entrance filters and movable attenuators to suppress the count rate from the thermal electron population , keeping the detector live time high and reducing pile - up contamination when observing the fainter high energy components .",
    "an alternative approach is to wait to observe until the solar disk itself blocks the emission from the footpoints and the thermal loops and to observe the emission from the non - thermal population of electrons that radiates at higher altitudes .    _",
    "nustar s _ sensitivity provides the opportunity to directly observe the acceleration region for faint limb - occulted flares .",
    "hxr emission from above the flare loop could originate from the energy release of the solar flare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus could provide new insights into the physical processes involved . while it is currently well established that the high - energy ( @xmath10  kev ) end of the accelerated electron population forms a power law , the low energy end is currently unexplored ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one speculation is that the flare acceleration mechanism forms a kappa distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the rollover from a power - law to a maxwellian distribution at low energies ( @xmath11 kev ) has not been observationally confirmed . extrapolating from _ rhessi _ observations of partly occulted flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ nustar _ , with its enhanced sensitivity , should see emission from above the main flare loop from _ goes _ b and c class flares , making it likely to catch events even in the decaying phase of the solar cycle .    observing such an occulted region with _",
    "nustar _ requires a high degree of planning and luck as the amount of occultation is crucial ; if even a small fraction of the main thermal loop is visible , then _ nustar _ will be overwhelmed with counts from the soft x - ray source .",
    "long observations of the solar limb one to three days after a productive active region has rotated out of view are the best approach for addressing this science goal .",
    "both the 2014 november 1 and 2014 december 11 too observations included targeting bright active regions just over the limb as part of the observing campaings .",
    "the magnitudes of solar flares span many decades in a wide variety of observables .",
    "large flares tend strongly to occur in active regions , near sunspots ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the population of solar flares , from large flares to microflares , does not contain enough energy to maintain the hot corona of the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed that innumerable",
    " nanoflares \" ( a term which has now been redefined to refer to faint flares in general , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could produce episodic energy input that would appear as a steady heat input to the solar corona .",
    "some recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have provided observational evidence for nanoflare heating within active regions , using soft x - ray and extreme ultraviolet observations to detect hot ( @xmath1510 mk ) plasma that is not predicted by competing heating models .",
    "however , evidence must be weighed together with well - established , though limited , x - ray spectroscopic observations of active regions that show no such evidence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the temperature structure of active regions thus remains an open question .",
    "several studies have suggested the existence of discrete heating events in the quiet sun outside of active regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but evidence of associated non - thermal particle acceleration has not yet been detected .",
    "the hxr ( @xmath12 kev ) is the ideal band in which to search for such a signal , though dedicated solar hxr observatories such as _ rhessi _ have lacked the necessary sensitivity to detect individual events in the quiet sun @xcite .",
    "if parker s nanoflares were to heat the corona , they would have to have physical properties different from microflares or flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the ratio of non - thermal to thermal particle populations is smaller in weaker flares ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "establishing this would enable us to identify the nanoflare and flare populations as different branches of the same physical family , with microflares predominantly occurring in active regions while nanoflares occur over the entire solar disk .",
    "searching for individual flares or nanoflare distributions in the quiet sun requires on - disk pointings when few active regions are present on the disk .",

    "a pilot observation was undertaken on 2014 september 10 , and was planned to be a mosaic of the solar disk as an engineering test to ensure that no damage would come to the optics or the spacecraft by pointing at the sun .",
    "unfortunately , a few hours prior to the start of the observation an x - class flare erupted from the sun . for mosaic tiles near the flaring region",
    "the event rate became so high that many photons were arriving at different spatial locations on the focal plane detectors during each 2 microsecond trigger window .",
    "this mimics the behavior of cosmic ray interactions in the detector , which are automatically vetoed by the onboard readout electronics .",
    "this resulted in the instrument being completely paralyzed during parts of the observation . though the observation did not prove scientifically valuable , it was successful in demonstrating that even in extreme solar conditions that there was no danger to the observatory ( optics , detectors , or spacecraft ) due to thermal loading when pointed at the sun .",
    "the observation lasted for two _ nustar _ orbits .",
    "the first orbit was spent obtaining a 16-tile raster pattern with marginally overlapping fields - of - view while the second orbit was spent targeting the solar north pole and slowly slewing away from the solar disk .",
    "both pointing strategies were designed for a much quieter solar environment and neither provided useful scientific data .",
    "an error in calculating the pointing locations led to an offset of the center of the raster pattern from the solar center which , serendipitously , allowed us to image the ghost ray pattern from the flaring regions ( figure [ fig : obs1 ] , see appendix [ sec : ghostrays ] for details on ghost rays ) .",
    "all of the photons seen in this image are ghost rays originating from the decaying x - class flare near the center of the sun , with the apparent  halo \" patterns caused by changes in the instrument livetime and event selection as the fov moved away from the solar disk .",
    "we find that even in this extreme case the integrated spectrum can be represented by a thin - target bremsstrahlung continuum plus the emission lines from an ionized plasma ( figure [ fig : obs1 ] , right panel ) .",
    "the second observation was triggered on 2014 november 1 as a bright active region ( ar12192 ) was setting over the west limb of the sun .",
    "the purpose was to study high coronal sources above the active region when the base of the active region were occulted by the limb of the sun .",
    "the observation lasted for four orbits , with the first and last orbits spent observing quiet regions of the solar disk .",
    "figure [ fig : obs2 ] shows a summary of the observation , including the reconstructed _",

    "as can be seen from the _ goes _ full - disk count rate , several microflares occurred during the first orbit , which was a dedicated pointing to the solar north pole .",

    "unfortunately , the source is outside of the fov of the _ goes_-sxi simultaneous images as well as that of _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ) .",
    "a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the source will be address in future work .",

    "the nominal energy threshold varies pixel - to - pixel with a mean value of @xmath12 kev and a 1-sigma spread of 0.4 kev and so the pixel - to - pixel variations could potentially introduce artifacts in the observed spectrum below @xmath12.5 kev .",
    "we therefore recommend limiting all spectral fitting to energies above 2.5 kev .",
    "according to ghost ray models , a source outside of the fov will produce ghost rays at a rate down by several orders of magnitude compared what the same source would produce on - axis ( i.e. when we are observing the double - bounce  focused \" photons ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ghostrays ] demonstrates this by showing the count rate ( integrated over the whole focal plane ) of a ray - trace simulation that placed a bright source at a range of off - axis angles . while the source is in the fov it produces count rates on the order of 10@xmath13 counts per second , while the source only produces count rates on the order of 10@xmath1410@xmath15 counts per second when outside of the fov .",
    "this elevated background has spatial structure that must be accounted for during analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the exact ghost ray image that we observe is difficult to model , since we do not directly know the distribution of sources responsible for the ghost rays , and so it s generally not possible to simulate exact ghost ray images that can be subtracted from the patterns that we observe . however , if we know the location of the active regions ( e.g. using a soft x - ray telescope to track flaring regions ) , then we can produce masks to screen out the regions of the detector most affected by ghost rays using the _ nustar _ ray - trace code .",
    "for example , we can simulate the ghost - ray images observed in the _ nustar _ mosaic images above ( figure [ fig : obs4 ] ) .",
    "based on the bright sources observed during the mosaic we can use our knowledge of the nustar pointing location to produce simulated images of the point sources and their ghost rays ( figure [ fig : mosaic_ghostrays ] ) . unfortunately , precisely matching the ghost - ray pattern and the observed data requires knowing the instantaneous flux from each of the point sources ; since by definition they re outside of the field - of - view this is not possible based on the _ nustar _ data alone and , since both _ goes _ and _ rhessi _ typically provide full - disk intensities , it s generally not possible to know the time - variable flux from flaring ar outside of the fov .",
    "we note that , in addition to the point sources considered here , the solar disk itself may also contribute ghost - rays in the hard x - rays . because we do not have a good understanding of the hard x - ray flux from the solar disk , which is known only as upper limits",
    ", we must wait for quiet sun observations that are not contaminated by ghost - rays from any point sources ( e.g. active regions ) to determine the effects of the solar disk .",
    "however , initial ray trace simulations indicate that the ghost ray contribution from the solar disk will be at the 1015% level of the flux from the solar disk itself .",
    "such analyses will be critical in the search for emission from the solar disk and for solar axions .",
    "the  detectors are relatively immune to pile - up in most astrophysics sources .",
    "these sources typically produce incident count rates of less than 1 count per second , though bright x - ray binaries can produce several hundred to several thousand counts per second on the detectors .",
    "in contrast , the observations of the sun typically produce incident rates of several hundred thousand counts per second . in this extreme count rate case",
    "we may need to account for the effects of pile - up .",
    "the general readout scheme of the electronics is described by @xcite , while the effects of deadtime on time - series analysis have been also been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the potential effects of any pile - up on the observed spectrum .",
    "pile - up can occur in  in two ways : ( 1 ) two photons occur in the same pixel and are read out as a single - pixel event by the on - board electronics ; ( 2 ) two photons occur in adjacent pixels and are identified as a `` split - pixel '' event ( grade @xmath16 ) in the post - processing software and the pulse heights are combined in the post - processing software .",
    "we investigate the first type of pile - up using the brightest astrophysical source , sco x-1 .",
    "sco x-1 was the second source of x - rays discovered in the sky ( the first beyond the sun ; * ? ? ? * ) and has been extensively studied by nearly all x - ray observatories .",
    "it has a well - known tendency to enter a flaring state , which produces incident count rates @xmath17 counts per second in _",
    "nustar _ observed sco x-1 for 20 ks ( sequence i d 30001040002 ) and detected two periods where the source entered a flaring state when the incident count rate exceeded 15,000 counts per second on the focal plane for extended periods of time as well as a period when the incident count rate was a more modest 6,000 counts per second .",
    "for reference , the crab produces an incident count rate of roughly 1,000 counts per second .",
    "since sco x-1 also has a steep thermal - type spectrum we can use it as a proxy to study the effects of pile - up that we might anticipate for observations of the sun , noting that sco x-1 s effective temperature ( 23 kev ) is much higher than that of the quiet sun , which may not exceed 0.15 kev @xcite .",
    "we can investigate this by considering event  grades \" that are non - physical .",
    "a  grade \" is a qualifier assigned to each event by the post - processing software by determining which pixels in a 3x3 grid centered on the triggered pixel have collected charge above a set software threshold . ",
    "\" events are those where only the central pixel is above threshold ( e.g. a single - pixel event ) , while grade@xmath00 events can occur when charge is  shared \" between pixels in the detector ( for more details see the _ nustar _ user s guide at the heasarc )",
    ". there are certain grades that can not be produced by charge sharing ( e.g. the inset in the left panel of figure [ fig : gradespec ] ) .",
    "photons with these grades can only occur when a second photon arrives within 2 microseconds of the first photon .        here",
    ", @xmath19 is the incident rate [ cts sec@xmath6 ] , @xmath21 is the pile - up window [ sec ] , and @xmath22 is the probability that a second photon arrives within the 3x3 detector pixel grid centered on the first photon . to estimate @xmath22",
    "we have used the encircled energy function ( eef ) files in the  caldb to determine the probability that a second photon will arrive within a radius of  2 detector pixels ( @xmath125 arcsecond ) from the center of the psf and divided by 9 to account for the number of pixels that could potentially cause pile - up . for @xmath21",
    "= 8@xmath7 seconds , @xmath22 = 5% , then for an incident rate of 12@xmath23 counts per second we expect a pile - up fraction of 5.3@xmath24 per pixel .",
    "if we use grades 21 - 24 ( e.g. , inset of figure [ fig : gradespec ] ) in sco x-1 as a proxy we instead find a pile - up fraction of 8e-4 per pixel , which we can recover if @xmath22 is 7.5% instead of 5% , which is a reasonable correction as the eef is integrated radially while in reality we are using a 3x3 square detector grid .",
    "we consider this to be a proof of concept that we have a good understanding of the origin of the pile - up in the _ nustar _ detectors and we can then use the grade 21 - 24 events as a proxy to measure the pile - up fraction .",
    "the major difference between sco x-1 and the sun is that sco x-1 is a point source and so the counts will be distributed on the focal plane in a pattern described by the psf of the optics , while for the sun the source or sources of hxrs may be extended and may spread over the entire field of view .",
    "this implies that , except for the case where a source of solar hxrs is small enough to emulate a point source , we generally expect fewer than 0.05% of events to be piled - up and so we can neglect the contribution of piled - up photons of the first type .",
    "however , we do urge caution and recommend that observers use this simple test to calculate the observed pile - up fraction by calculating the number of events per grade over the grade 2124 range .",
    "this leaves only pile - up of the second variety where two photons arrive in adjacent pixels and are combined during post - processing .",
    "this is a far more simple case that we can simply reject in post - processing by ignoring all events with grades@xmath00 .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : gradespec ] shows the effect of applying such a filter to the _ nustar _ data .",
    "the difference in slope above @xmath15  kev between the grade 0 ( single - pixel , black ) events and the  multiple - pixel \" events ( cyan and red ) indicates that the multiple - pixel events are in fact piled - up counts masquerading as multiple - pixel events .",
    "we view this as confirmation that we can remove the piled - up photons of the second type ."
