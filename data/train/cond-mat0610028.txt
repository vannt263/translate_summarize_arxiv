    "the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fn ) model @xcite has been widely adopted as a simple model for a wide class of subjects not only for neural networks but also for reaction - diffusion chemical systems .",

    "the fn model is usually solved by direct simulation ( ds ) or the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) method . for @xmath0-unit fn model",
    ", ds requires the computational time which grows as @xmath2 with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the fpe method leads to @xmath3-dimensional partial equations to be solved with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "a useful semi - analytical method for stochastic equations has been proposed , taking account of the first and second moments of variables @xcite .",
    "recently we have proposed in @xcite the augmented moment method ( amm ) based on a macroscopic point of view . in the amm",
    ", we describe the properties of the stochastic ensembles in terms of a fairly small number of variables , paying our attention to their global behavior . for the @xmath0-unit stochastic systems ,",

    "this figure is , for example , @xmath8 for the langevin model ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 for the fn model ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the amm has been successfully applied to a study on the dynamics of coupled stochastic systems described by the langevin , fn and hodgkin - huxley models subjected to additive noises with global , local or small - world couplings ( with and without transmission delays ) @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the noise - induced phenomena such as stochastic resonance , noised - induced ordered state and noised - induced bifurcation have been extensively studied .",
    "interesting phenomena caused by additive and multiplicative noises have been intensively investigated ( for a recent review , see refs .",
    "@xcite : related references therein ) .",
    "it has been realized that the properties of multiplicative noises are different from those of additive noises in some respects as follows .",
    "( 1 ) multiplicative noise induces the transition , creating an ordered state , while additive noise is against the ordering @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) although the probability distribution in langevin systems subjected to additive gaussian noise follows the gaussian , multiplicative gaussian noise generally yields non - gaussian distribution @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) the scaling relation of the effective strength : @xmath12 valid for additive noise is not applicable for multiplicative noise : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote effective strengths of multiplicative and additive noises , respectively , of @xmath0-unit systems @xcite .    in order to show the above item ( 3 ) ,",
    "the present author has adopted the amm for the langevin model in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "the amm was originally developed by expanding variables around their mean values in stochastic equations to obtain the second - order moments both for local and global variables @xcite . to extend the applicability of the amm to stochastic systems including multiplicative noises , we have reformulated it for the langevin model with the use of the fpe @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that a naive approximation of the scaling relation for multiplicative noise : @xmath16 , as adopted in @xcite , leads to the result which is in disagreement with that of dss .",
    "it is doubly difficult to study analytically the _ dynamical _ properties of stochastic systems with _ finite _ populations .",

    "recently , the time - dependent probability distribution is treated with a series expansion of the hermite polynomials , with which dynamics of @xmath17 stochastic systems is expressed by the time - dependent expansion coefficients @xcite . in the amm ,",

    "we are interested in the stochastic bifurcation , which is one of interesting phenomena induced by noise ( refs .",
    "@xcite , related references therein ) .",
    "the theory on stochastic bifurcation is still in its infancy .",
    "indeed , there is no stringent definition of the stochastic bifurcation . at the moment",
    ", two kinds of definitions have been proposed : ( i ) one is based on a sudden change in the stationary probability distribution , and ( ii ) the other is based on a sudden change in the sign of the largest lyapunov index . unfortunately these two definitions do not necessarily yield the same result .",
    "the bifurcation of the single @xcite and ensemble fn model @xcite subjected to additive noise has been recently discussed .",
    "based on the second - order moment method , the bifurcation analysis has been made for globally - coupled fn model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where dynamics of fast variables is separated from and projected to that of slow variables subjected to additive noise .",
    "we will discuss the bifurcation in the fn ensembles subjected to additive and/or multiplicative noises , making a linear stability analysis to our _ deterministic _ amm equations .",

    "the effect of noise depends on the type of noises , and it is also model dependent @xcite .",
    "the item ( b ) is similar to the item ( 1 ) of an ordered state created by multiplicative noises @xcite-@xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "a disadvantage of our amm is that its applicability is limited to weak - noise cases . in physics",

    "one of such examples is the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) which has been widely employed in solid - state physics .",
    "the rpa is valid in the limit of weak interactions .",
    "the rpa is , however , used for larger interactions leading to the divergence in the response function , which signifies the occurrence of excitations such as spin waves .",
    "we expect that the amm may be such an approximate method , yielding meaningful qualitative result even for strong noises .    on the contrary ,",
    "an advantage of the amm is that we can easily discuss dynamical properties of the finite @xmath0-unit stochastic systems . for @xmath0-unit fn neuronal ensembles ,",
    "the amm yields the eight - dimensional ordinary des , while ds and fpe require the @xmath224-dimensional stochastic des and the @xmath225-dimensional partial des , respectively .",
