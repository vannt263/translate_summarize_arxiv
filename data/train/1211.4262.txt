    "shewhart ( 1931 ) introduced control charts in the mid 19th century as means for statistical process control [ 1 ] .",
    "shewhart developed both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 control charts , but initially , owing to its ease of construction , @xmath1 chart was more preferred .",
    "however , nowadays , with high speed production processes , large subgroups can be easily obtained .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 charts are more relevant because standard deviation is a better measure of dispersion than the range .",
    "later on , a multivariate analogue of shewhart chart was introduced on the basis of the hotelling s @xmath5 statistic [ 3 ] . a major criticism of the shewhart chart and its multivariate analogue entails from the fact that both mean ( @xmath6 ) and standard deviation ( @xmath7 ) are non - robust measures of central tendency and dispersion .",
    "another drawback of @xmath0 type of control charts is its poor performance under small mean shifts .",
    "various charts have been proposed using robust measures like runs test [ 7 ] , repeated median filters [ 10 ] or univariate trimmed mean and range [ 16 ] .",
    "these methods though efficient , lack interpretability and are computationally difficult .",
    "liu [ 1995 ] proposed a _",
    "r chart _ based on the ranks of the data points for multivariate data [ 20 ] .",
    "she asserted that the ranks , when scaled to [ 0,1 ] will follow a uniform distribution and hence , the empirical distribution of the ranks would converge in law to @xmath8 .",
    "a problem with this method is that it neglects the true values of the observations and considers only relative percentiles . as a result ,",
    "even if an observation undergoes moderate change , the change may not be reflected in the _",
    "r chart_. in this paper we have proposed control charts based on trimmed mean and winsorized standard deviation and discussed its distributional features . we have extended our notion to ewma ( _ exponentially weighted moving average _ ) control charts .",
    "we have also suggested alternatives based on our approach , to hotelling @xmath4 charts [ 3 ] and multivariate ewma charts using data depth .",
    "the distributions of the measures of central tendency and dispersion have been studied using re - sampling methods like _",
    "bootstrapping_. we have compared the @xmath9 ( average run length ) performance of our proposed chart with that of the usual mean and variance based control charts .",
    "the results of the study have established that in the presence of outliers , our proposed control chart clearly outshines the standardl charts , and has comparable performance with the latter in absence of outliers . therefore the use of such charts is strongly recommended .",
    "all the relevant developments have been discussed in the subsequent sections .",
    "the programs have been written and evaluated in statistical softwares like matlab2009a and r2.11.1 .",
    "univariate trimmed mean was proposed by tukey ( 1963 ) as a robust estimate of process average [ 27 ] .",
    "let @xmath10 be a sample of size @xmath11 on measurement of a particular quality characteristic .",
    "then the @xmath12 trimmed mean is defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 ; @xmath15 $ ] . for simplification , iglewicz and langenberg ( 1986 ) have taken @xmath16 to be the floor of @xmath17 as an approximation [ 16 ] .",
    "the tukey trimmed mean follows asymptotically normal distribution and its standard error is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath12 winsorized standard deviation",
    ". however the distribution of @xmath20 is not known . by definition , this statistic is robust .",
    "the multivariate definition of trimmed mean depends on the choice of an appropriate depth function .    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the value of the chosen depth function for the @xmath23 vector observation @xmath24 and _",
    "cutvalue _ is the minimum value of depth that would be accepted in data trimming .",
    "we further define winsorized variance for multivariate observations to be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the estimated dispersion matrix computed from the @xmath27 s where @xmath28 if @xmath29 and @xmath30 otherwise where , @xmath31 is the observation @xmath24 with minimum depth above @xmath32 .",
    "the four types of depth functions used for trimming by us are ,    1 .   spatial depth or l-1 data depth ( chaudhuri , p. ( 1996 ) ) 2 .",
    "tukey depth ( tukey , j. w. ( 1975 ) ) 3 .   liu depth or simplicial depth ( liu , r. y. ( 1988 ) ) 4 .",
    "oja depth ( oja , h. ( 1983 ) )    the reasons being that they have desirable properties like affine invariance , maximality of center , monotonicity w.r.t .",
    "the deepest point and vanishing at infinity .",
    "first , we present a theoretical background corresponding to the various control charts that form the basis of our study .      in shewhart control chart ( @xmath0 ) , the distribution of @xmath6 and s under the normality assumption was used in order to determine the central line and the control limits of the chart .",
    "if the data comes from a normal distribution , the mean of the data will also follow normal distribution and the probability that the mean of the subgroups of size @xmath11 go beyond the @xmath33 limit is as small as 0.0023 .",
    "we use @xmath34 as the control limits in the @xmath6 control chart , the standard error of the subgroup means being an unbiased estimator of @xmath35 .",
    "the distribution of s under normality of subgroup means was used for constructing the s - chart .",
    "we propose the use of trimmed mean @xmath36 and its standard error , @xmath37 in developing the charts .",
    "the control limits of the charts will follow from the distributional features of these two quantities .",
    "if the observations(@xmath38 ) are from @xmath39 then one can take the transformation @xmath40 .",
    "thus standard normal distribution is taken as the reference distribution for our discussion .",
    "it has been observed by us from simulation studies that trimmed mean(@xmath41 ) is asymptotically normal ( figure  [ fig : normalqqplot ] ) and @xmath42 asymptotically follows a gamma distribution whose parameters can be estimated from the data ( figure  [ fig : gammaqqplot ] ) .",
    "+      the usual ewma control chart building mechanism is as follows .",
    "let @xmath43 be the @xmath23 subgroup mean , then we define an exponentially weighted average for each @xmath44 from 1 to @xmath11 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 being a constant where @xmath47 , the process target value , which we consider to be @xmath48 , mean of subgroup means , in our study .",
    "it is known that for large number of subgroups , the in - control @xmath49 and @xmath50 may be chosen to be @xmath51 for suitable choice of @xmath52 and @xmath46 respectively with the central line being @xmath53 . for our proposed analogue",
    ", we replace the subgroup means by @xmath12 trimmed subgroup mean .",
    "the mechanism is same as in the case of shewhart chart , though here we do not use any distributional features of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for forming the control chart , instead we just plug in @xmath54 and @xmath55 as robust estimators of @xmath53 and @xmath35 in the usual control limits .",
    "the choice of l and @xmath46 though are subjective as in the usual case .",
    "assume that we have a process at hand that generates multivariate observations , say @xmath56-variate observations @xmath57    @xmath58 and we need to ensure that the process stays in control over time .",
    "one way to do it is to treat variables separately and construct control charts for each of them .",
    "but that approach besides being laborious and time consuming , neglects the correlation among the variables . hotelling s",
    "@xmath4 control charts are the most popular multivariate control charts in general .",
    "the hotelling @xmath4 statistic , @xmath59 follows @xmath60 under normality assumption , where @xmath56 is the number of variables , for a sample of size n. once we estimate @xmath61 by * s * , the unbiased estimator then @xmath62 .",
    "+ we suggest a modification to the ordinary hotelling @xmath4 statistic in order to make it robust .",
    "the new test statistic proposed is @xmath63 where @xmath41 and @xmath64 are as defined in * sec:2*. it is very difficult to determine the distribution of @xmath65 accurately since it depends on various factors such as the subgroup size(@xmath66 ) , choice of the depth function ( @xmath67 ) , _ cutvalue _ of trimming etc .",
    "so we had to resort bootstrap techniques .",
    "the univariate definition of ewma chart easily extends to the multivariate case . for p - variate observations ,",
    "define p - variate vector @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes a @xmath70 matrix , @xmath43 @xmath71th subgroup mean vector and @xmath72 .",
    "assume @xmath69 to be a scalar matrix with diagonal element @xmath46 for simplicity of calculations and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the variance covariance matrix of subgroup means .",
    "we know that @xmath75 , for mean @xmath76 and variance - covariance matrix @xmath77 follows @xmath60 distribution under the normality assumption of @xmath78 .",
    "the quantity to be plotted in the mewma control chart is @xmath79 for each i , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the sample counterparts of the mean and variance of the @xmath82 values respectively .",
    "we , however propose to plot the statistic @xmath83 for @xmath71 th sample value of @xmath82 , where @xmath84 is the trimmed mean due to the `` i''th subgroup .",
    "we use + @xmath85 as our test statistic for the @xmath44th sample value of @xmath82,where @xmath86 is the sample winsorized variance - covariance matrix of the @xmath82 values .",
    "but again it is difficult to find the distribution of our proposed statistic and we have to resort to bootstrap techniques in order to construct the control chart .",
    "trimmed mean control chart is expected to give better result than the mean and variance based control chart when the process is in control but the data contains some outliers . in order to test the comparative performance of our chart ,",
    "we need to insert certain outliers to our simulated data .",
    "we adopt the outlier insertion rules due to gupta and sengupta [ 10 ] in this regard .    *",
    "each subgroup contains a fixed number of outliers . *",
    "each outlier is actually a random number from a largely shifted distribution . * the place where the outlier is to put is done by randomly choosing the point . *",
    "the sign of the outlier is taken + /-",
    "with probability half to each of them .    in our studies , for 0.25 shift and for 10%",
    "trimming we took one outlier and for 20%trimming we inserted two outliers in each subgroup .",
    "we carried out a number of simulation studies in order to test for the performance of the chart proposed by us compared to the standard mechanisms .",
    "we considered our reference distribution to be standard normal , because given a normal density with specified mean and variance , we can use the z - transformation to bring it to standard normal and apply the same set of procedures as discussed above . in phase",
    "i , we simulated 80 rational subgroups of fixed subgroup size from the standard normal distribution ( in control distribution ) and used these to construct the control limits for both shewhart s @xmath0 and our proposed @xmath41- @xmath55 charts . in phase ii",
    ", 10,000 subgroups of observations are generated from the reference distribution , subgroup means are plotted and the @xmath9 is recorded .",
    "the subgroup sizes for the univariate shewhart chart have been taken to be 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 and 20 , because such sample sizes are more used in practice in industrial processes .",
    "for ewma chart , we have taken subgroups of size 20 and fixed our @xmath52 at a convenient level of 3 ( standard choice ) . we have taken @xmath46 to be 0.20,0.25 and 0.40 , which are the preferred choices ( crowder and stephen [ 9 ] , lucas _ et al . _",
    "[ 22 ] , hunter [ 15 ] ) and @xmath52 to be 3.we have observed the performance of the ewma chart corresponding to three values of @xmath46 namely 0.4,0.25 and 0.2.the trimming percentage is usually taken to be 10@xmath87 or 20@xmath87 for each subgroup .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath50 have been taken to be @xmath88 and @xmath89 percentile points for the proposed charts .",
    "the control charts presented at the back of our report ( table  [ table : arluniv ] ) and ( table  [ table : arlewma ] ) give a comparison of our proposed chart with the shewhart chart and ewma chart in 3 scenarios - no shift , under small mean shift and in the presence of an outlier .",
    "for multivariate case , we do not standardize the data because of the lack of significance of it .",
    "we take the subgroup size to be 20 . for trimming the data ,",
    "we have used our previously mentioned four depth functions and compared the control chart performance under each case .",
    "but the data trimming will obviously depend on the choice of the @xmath32 used for trimming .",
    "we simulate data from a bivariate normal distribution with @xmath91= @xmath92 and variance covariance matrix @xmath93= @xmath94 in 1000 subgroups of size 20 each . to get an optimal cut - off value we select a large sample say of 100 in control subgroups from the process and find the depths of all the points in each subgroup . for mewma",
    "chart , choice of @xmath52 and @xmath46 are same as in univariate ewma chart . since the distribution of the test statistic of interest is not known , we use bootstrapping .",
    "we first drew 100 subgroups of observations of same subgroup size when the process is in control .",
    "we selected 1000 subgroups of same size with replacement from these 100 subgroups and computed trimmed mean @xmath95 and winsorized dispersion matrix @xmath96 for @xmath44th subgroup for a given the depth function .",
    "we computed the grand trimmed mean and mean of the subgroup winsorized dispersion matrices , @xmath97 @xmath98 for each subgroup we computed @xmath99 for each subgroup and calculated its empirical distribution .    for mewma chart , a similar procedure of resampling",
    "is adopted . here",
    ", we compute @xmath100 for each @xmath44 , taking @xmath54 to be @xmath101 .",
    "then we compute @xmath102 , the grand mean of all the @xmath103 values .",
    "we estimate the dispersion matrix of the z variable @xmath104 1000 @xmath105 values are obtained and empirical distribution is computed .",
    "for distribution of both @xmath106 and @xmath105 , we choose @xmath107th percentile point as @xmath49 and 0 as @xmath50 as the process is out of control only when these statistics are significantly high .",
    "we have compared our recommended multivariate control chart under various depth functions with the standard charts under no shift , small mean shifts and in presence of outliers.(table  [ table : arlmulti ] and table  [ table : arlmultimulti ] ) .",
    "next , we have compared our approach with the two approaches due to liu [ 20 ] based on ranks and another approach based on mcd estimators by chenouri",
    "_ et al_[28 ] .",
    "we considered a samples of size 20 from @xmath108 and tested for the comparative efficacy of the individual algorithms under mean shifts and presence of outliers .",
    "the results are reported in table  [ table : liumcd ] .",
    "liu s method performed exceptionally well in case of mean shifts but was also very responsive to the presence of outliers , while mcd method , despite being well adapted to the presence of outliers , had poor performance under small mean shifts .",
    "our method on the other hand had good performance both under mean shifts and presence of outliers .",
    "so , the strength of our algorithm as an alternative to standard charts is quite obvious .",
    "* for a process in control or for small mean shifts , there is not much to choose between the mean based control chart and our proposed control chart .",
    "however , as expected , our recommended chart performs way better than the shewhart and ewma charts and their corresponding multivariate analogs , that too for any choice of depth function in multivariate case .",
    "* we have preferred subgroup size around 20 , because very small subgroup sizes often lead to unusual fluctuations in the @xmath109 values .",
    "some depth functions , like tukey s depth are not at all reliable for small sample sizes and may cause excessive data loss on trimming . + * it has been observed that bad choice of cut - off value often leads to highly fluctuating @xmath49 and @xmath50 values and the control chart no longer stays very reliable .",
    "that is why we have considered estimation of the @xmath32 in the multivariate case to serve this purpose .",
    "we have considered the distribution of the depth function corresponding to all the points and taken a quantile corresponding to the distribution as @xmath32 so that neither is there a huge data loss nor a complete retainment of data in most cases .",
    "+ * some depth functions have limitations of application .",
    "tukey s depth can only assume a limited range of values for subgroup sizes like 10 or 20 .",
    "so , in such cases this depth is not at all reliable .",
    "liu depth can be used for bivariate data only and can not be extended to higher + dimensions . spatial depth and the oja depth",
    "have been very consistent in their performances under various scenarios viz - change in subgroup size , change in @xmath46 values , dimensionality etc as evident from table  [ table : arlewma ] and table  [ table : arlmulti ] , so these are more preferable under general circumstances compared to liu and tukey depth . + * from bootstrapping up to the process surveillance stage , subgroup size should not be changed a lot . that s because the @xmath49 and @xmath50 are obtained from an empirical distribution for a given sample size .",
    "so , with sample size , it is expected to alter as well .",
    "but it has been seen up to k@xmath110 not much deviation in @xmath109 values ins observed .",
    "+ * for ewma control chart we observe that the choice of @xmath46 and @xmath111 values play a significant role.though standard @xmath111 may be taken to be 3 , but it is very difficult to choose an optimal @xmath46 uniformly for all choices of depth functions .",
    "however we have observed that @xmath46 in the range of 0.20 - 0.40 gives better arl performance compared to others .",
    "+ * we were not able to get good fits for the @xmath105 and @xmath112 statistics data in most cases , with any standard distributions over the entire support .",
    "the gamma distribution fits the data well for except for the high end values , which leads to lack of fit .",
    "due to the lack of any standard distribution fit , we had to resort to bootstrapping .",
    "but in practical scenarios , one may still use the gamma distribution in finding the cut - off as the bootstrap is computationally difficult .",
    "it will not be a very bad approximation and will save time .",
    "we present the gamma distribution fits to the empirical distribution of @xmath112 and @xmath105 to assert this point .",
