    "an interesting problem in birational geometry is , given @xmath1 a projective variety of general type , to understand for which @xmath2 the @xmath2-th pluricanonical linear system @xmath3 yields a birational map .",
    "+ for varieties of _ maximal albanese dimension _",
    "( i.e. the albanese map @xmath4 is generically finite ) , this study brought some surprising result , since chen and hacon @xcite proved that , independently on the dimension , @xmath5 is birational for every @xmath6 .",
    "more recently , it was shown by jiang @xcite , applying ideas from @xcite , that , if @xmath1 is as above , the pentacanonical map @xmath7 is birational .",
    "the main result of this paper , whose proof also uses @xmath8-regularity techniques introduced by pareschi and popa in @xcite , is an improvement of chen - hacon and jiang s theorems :    if @xmath1 is a complex projective smooth variety of maximal albanese dimension and general type , then the tetracanonical map @xmath9 birational .",
    "the argument consists in showing that reducible divisors @xmath10 , with @xmath11,@xmath12 and @xmath13 separate points in a suitable open set of @xmath1 .",
    "the crucial point is that , for all @xmath11 , the sections of @xmath14 passing trough a general point of @xmath1 have good generation properties . in order to achieve this we use pareschi - popa theory of @xmath8-regularity and continuous global generation ( @xcite ) , joint with a theorem of chen - hacon @xcite on the fact that the variety @xmath15 spans @xmath16 . + it is worth to recall that if @xmath1 is variety of maximal albanese dimension , then @xmath17 ( @xcite ) and that chen - hacon proved in @xcite that if @xmath18 then , as for curves , the tricanonical map is always birational and this is sharp , as shown by curves of genus 2 .",
    "therefore our result is relevant only in the more mysterious case where @xmath19 , which appears only in dimension @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact the author does not know any example of varieties of maximal albanese dimension with non - birational tricanonical map and it is tempting to conjecture that the tricanonical map should be always birational for such varieties . + in the sequel , @xmath1 will always be a smooth complex variety of general type and maximal albanese dimension while @xmath21 shall denote its dualizing sheaf .",
    "by @xmath22 we will mean the albanese variety of @xmath1 .",
    "given @xmath23 an invertible sheaf on a projective variety @xmath24 , then @xmath25 will be the asymptotic multiplier ideal sheaf associated to the complete linear series @xmath26 ( cfr .",
    "@xcite ) . finally",
    ", if @xmath27 is a coherent sheaf on @xmath24 , then by @xmath28 we will mean @xmath29 . given a linear system @xmath30",
    ", we will say , with a slight abuse of notation , that it is birational if the corresponding rational map @xmath31 is birational .",
    "i am indebted to my advisor , g. pareschi , for many advices and valuable suggestions .",
    "i am also very grateful to c. hacon , and m. popa for carefully reading a first draft of this paper and suggesting many emprovements and corrections .",
    "moreover , a particular thank must go to c. hacon for explaining to me how to work with some specific examples .",
    "finally it is a pleasure to thank a. calabri , c. ciliberto , a. rapagnetta , g. pareschi and f. viviani for very interesting and useful discussion .",
    "in what follows we briefly recall some definitions about @xmath8-regular sheaves and their generation property . given a coherent sheaf @xmath27 on a smooth projective variety @xmath24",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the _ non - generation locus of @xmath27 _ , i. e. the support of the cokernel of the evaluation map@xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a line bundle , then @xmath32 is just the base locus of @xmath27 .",
    "+ the _ cohomological support loci _ of @xmath27 are defined as : @xmath34 as for cohomology groups , we will occasionally suppress @xmath24 from the notation , simply writing @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath27 a sheaf on a smooth projective variety @xmath24 .    1 .",
    "it is said to be @xmath36 if @xmath37 for every @xmath38 . in the case",
    "@xmath24 is an abelian variety , @xmath36 sheaves are called _",
    "@xmath8-regular_. 2 .   given @xmath39",
    ", we say that @xmath27 is _ continuously globally generated at @xmath40 _ ( in brief cgg at @xmath40 ) if the sum of the evaluation maps @xmath41 is surjective for every @xmath42 non empty open set of @xmath43 .",
    "[ ese ] in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.13 ) pareschi and popa proved that an @xmath8-regular sheaf on an abelian variety is cgg at every point .",
    "we will prove this slightly more general statement :        [ lem : effdiv ] let @xmath47 an effective divisor on an abelian variety @xmath48 .",
    "take @xmath49 subtori of @xmath48 such that they generate @xmath48 as an abstract group and let @xmath50 , @xmath51 some points of @xmath48 .",
    "then @xmath52 for at least one @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath47 is ample , then the statement is easily seen to be true .",
    "thus we can suppose , without a loss of generality , that @xmath47 is not ample .",
    "then there exists an abelian variety @xmath54 , a surjective homomorphism @xmath55 and an ample divisor @xmath56 on @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath47 does not intersect @xmath59 for every @xmath53 , it follows that @xmath56 does not intersect @xmath60 for every @xmath53 .",
    "hence , since @xmath56 is ample , the image @xmath59 through @xmath61 is a point , and therefore @xmath62 is contained in the kernel of @xmath61 for every @xmath53 .",
    "but this is impossible since the @xmath62 s generate @xmath48 .",
    "+ let @xmath63 albanese map of @xmath1 .",
    "let us state the following claim .",
    "+ _ claim 1 : _ for the generic @xmath64 the sheaf @xmath65 is @xmath8-regular . + before proceeding with the proof of the claim 1 let us see how it implies theorem a , this argument follows the one pareschi and popa in @xcite .",
    "first of all we simplify a bit the notation by letting @xmath66 .",
    "now observe that , since the albanese morphism @xmath67 is generically finite , a well known extension of grauert - riemenschneider vanishing theorem ( see , for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proof of proposition 5.4 ) ) yields that , for any @xmath68 , the higher direct images @xmath69 vanish .",
    "therefore , for every @xmath70 we get the equality @xmath71 by nadel vanishing for adymptotic multiplier ideals ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.2.12 ) ) the loci at the left hand side are empty when @xmath38 .",
    "in particular @xmath72 is @xmath8-regular on @xmath22 and hence cgg everywhere ( example [ ese ] ) . since @xmath67 is generically finite , we get that @xmath73 is cgg away from @xmath74 , the exceptional locus of @xmath67 .",
    "this means by definition that the map @xmath75 is surjective for every @xmath76 and for every @xmath77 non - empty open set .",
    "now we recall that the base locus of @xmath78 is contained in the base locus of @xmath79 for every @xmath44 ; hence we can consider the closed set @xmath80 .",
    "it follows easily from that , if @xmath81 the map @xmath82 is surjective for every @xmath83 open dense set in @xmath16 and thus @xmath14 is cgg away from @xmath84 .",
    "+ from now on , since we are supposing that the claim is true , we can take @xmath42 a non - empty open set of @xmath1 such that for every @xmath85 the sheaf @xmath86 is @xmath8-regular and hence cgg . again",
    ", it follows that @xmath87 is cgg away from @xmath74 . finally by (",
    "* proposition 2.12 ) @xmath88 is globally generated away from @xmath84 and therefore @xmath89 is globally generated away from @xmath90 and we can conclude that @xmath91 is very ample outside a proper subvariety of @xmath1 and hence @xmath92 is birational for every @xmath68 .",
    "this prove the theorem .",
    "+ now we proceed with the proof claim 1 .",
    "recall that , by the subtorus theorem ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 0.1 ) and @xcite ) , we can write @xmath93\\ ] ] where the @xmath94 s are torsion points of @xmath16 and the @xmath95 s are subtori of @xmath16 . hence , for all @xmath53 and for all @xmath96 the line bundle @xmath97 has sections , and therefore its base locus @xmath98 is a proper subvariety of z. we take an non - empty zariski open set @xmath42 contained in the complement of @xmath99 given @xmath85 we want to prove that for every @xmath100 @xmath101 consider the following short exact sequence : @xmath102 where @xmath103 . since @xmath104 does not belong to the exceptional locus of the albanese map of @xmath1 , by pushing forward for @xmath67 we still get a short exact sequence:@xmath105 in particular @xmath106 .",
    "since , as already observed , an extension of grauert - riemenschneider vanishing , yields the vanishing the @xmath107 for every @xmath108 and every @xmath103 , we have that @xmath109 for every @xmath108 and every @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , for every @xmath111 @xmath112 now we look at the long cohomology sequence of the short exact sequence . by nadel vanishing we have",
    "that , for every @xmath113 and @xmath103 , @xmath114 and therefore , by the loci @xmath115 are empty for every @xmath116 .",
    "+ it remains to see that @xmath117 . before proceeding further",
    "we state the following : + _ claim 2 : _ for every @xmath118 , @xmath119)=\\emptyset.$ ] + the reader may observe that , since by a result of chen and hacon ( ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) ) the @xmath95 s generate @xmath16 , this , together with lemma [ lem : effdiv ] , implies directly claim 1 . in fact",
    "the locus @xmath120 is a proper subvariety of @xmath16 that can not possibly contain a divisor , hence its codimension shall be greater than 1 . by also @xmath117 . + to prove claim 2 we reason in the following way .",
    "first we remark that there is an alternative description of the locus @xmath120 : in fact by and the vanishing of @xmath121 for every @xmath110 ( again due to nadel vanishing ) we have that @xmath122 if and only if the map @xmath123 is not surjective",
    ". therefore we can write @xmath124 since we chose @xmath125 there exists @xmath126 a dense open set of @xmath95 such that , for every @xmath127 , @xmath104 is not in @xmath128 .",
    "take @xmath129 ; the intersection @xmath130 is still a non - empty open set of @xmath95 .",
    "for @xmath131 we write @xmath132 since , thanks to our choice of @xmath133 , both @xmath134 and @xmath135 are generated at @xmath104 , also the left hand side is . therefore @xmath136 .",
    "now by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 6.3(b ) ) , the zero locus of @xmath137 is contained in the base locus of @xmath138 for every @xmath139 ; thus we have the equality @xmath140 and , consequently , @xmath141 and the claim is proved ."
