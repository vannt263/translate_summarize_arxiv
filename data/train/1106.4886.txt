    "the heavy - fermion phenomenon , which is observable in many rare - earth materials is still an active field of researched area .",
    "the simplest model , which can account for these phenomena is the periodic anderson model . for a review on this topic see @xcite .",
    "the model in its simplest form describes a hybridization ( @xmath2 ) between a wide conduction band and correlated @xmath1-electrons localized at lattice sites . despite its simple form there is no general solution to this problem , exact solutions have been obtained only in some special cases @xcite .",
    "nonperturbative approaches like variational methods are applicable even if the coulomb interaction ( @xmath3 ) between the @xmath1-electrons is large , though we have to use some uncontrolled approximation when calculating the expectation values . in a recent paper",
    "@xcite it was shown that the repulsion between the @xmath0- and @xmath1-electrons plays an important role in valence transition .",
    "it has been argued that the sudden change of valence of ce can account for the presence of a sharp peak in the transition temperature of some superconducting ce based compounds .",
    "the effects of this new interaction have been examined with dynamical mean field theory , slave - boson method @xcite , variational monte carlo technique @xcite and projector - based renormalization approach @xcite .",
    "it has been found in these papers that intermediate valent region narrows in the presence of @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling .    in this paper",
    "we examine the ground state properties of this extended model using the gutzwiller method .",
    "however , the conventional @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction @xmath4 is too difficult to handle within the framework of this method , so we consider a modified @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction @xmath5 where electrons repel each other only when site @xmath6 is fully occupied .",
    "the reason for this modification is that it can be treated easier , since much less electron configurations need to be taken into account .",
    "we summarize the main steps of the performed variational calculation following ref .",
    "for simplicity in the present work we restrict ourselves to a nonmagnetic half - filled band , although the variational procedure can be carried out without these assumptions .",
    "assuming that there are @xmath7 up- and down - spin electrons in an arbitrary dimensional lattice with @xmath8 lattice sites , we consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the symbol @xmath12 denotes the wave vector , and @xmath6 the site index .",
    "the width of the @xmath0-band is @xmath13 .",
    "the trial wave function of gutzwiller - type is expressed as @xmath14|0\\rangle,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the mixing amplitudes @xmath15 are also variational parameters , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the gutzwiller projectors , which are written down as follows : @xmath18,\\\\   \\hat{p}_{\\rm g}^f & = & \\prod_{\\boldsymbol{j}}[1-(1-\\eta_f)\\hat{n}_{\\boldsymbol{j}\\uparrow}^f   \\hat{n}_{\\boldsymbol{j}\\downarrow}^f],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the variational parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are controlled by @xmath21 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "we use the so - called gutzwiller approximation to evaluate the expectation values of the hamiltonian .",
    "optimizing the ground state energy density with respect to the mixing amplitudes , we obtain the following expression for that : @xmath22 \\nonumber\\\\       + ( \\epsilon_f-\\tilde{\\epsilon}_f)n_f+\\widetilde{u}_{df}\\nu_{df}+u_f\\nu_f , \\label{eq : energy}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the average number of @xmath1electrons per site , i.e. @xmath24 @xmath25 denotes the density of the doubly occupied @xmath1-sites and @xmath26 is the density of such sites when both the @xmath1- and @xmath0-sites are doubly occupied , @xmath27 is the quasiparticle energy level of the @xmath1-electron ( the effective @xmath1-level , its precise form is not presented here due to its lengthy form ) , @xmath28 denotes the renormalized hybridized amplitude , @xmath28=@xmath29 , and the summation is carried out over all wave numbers , @xmath30 , of electrons in the fermi sea ( fs ) .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the kinetic energy renormalization factors for the @xmath0-electrons and @xmath1-electrons respectively and are functions of @xmath33 ( the total numbers of electrons per site ) , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( the density of the doubly occupied @xmath0-sites ) , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "the determination of these quantities is the main task of the gutzwiller method .",
    "their forms in the present model are much more complicated than in those models which do not contain the interaction @xmath21 .",
    "the results are written in the following complete square ( gutzwiller - like ) form :    @xmath36    where @xmath33 is the total number of electrons per site , i.e. @xmath37 it is worth mentioning that without @xmath21 , @xmath32 depends only on @xmath34 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "since there is no direct hopping between the different @xmath1-sites , @xmath32 appears only in the renormalized hybridized amplitude @xmath28=@xmath29 .",
    "it should be emphasized that @xmath31 is not unity , i.e.  the width of the @xmath0-band is narrowed , though there is no coulomb repulsion between the @xmath0-electrons .",
    "it is also remarkable that the renormalization amplitude of the hybridization still can be written as the square root of the product of @xmath32 and @xmath31 in spite of this new interaction .",
    "these are the main results of this paper .",
    "for further calculations we assume that the density of states of the @xmath0-band is constant , @xmath38 , when @xmath39 is in the interval @xmath40 $ ] . using this assumption the summation over the wave vectors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) can still be performed analytically .",
    "the ground state energy density thus obtained should be optimized with respect to @xmath35 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath34 . after this procedure",
    "we arrive at a nonlinear system of equations for these unknown quantities .",
    "we solve the obtained equations numerically .",
    "typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ nf_ef : fig ] .     the @xmath1-level occupancy as a function of the energy @xmath41 of the @xmath1-level at half - filling , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the continuous and dotted curves belong to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the enlarged view of the framed region . ]",
    "one can see that switching on @xmath21 also results in the narrowing of the intermediate valent regime of 2@xmath461 as the conventional @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction ( see eq.([conventional - udf ] ) ) @xcite , while no narrowing occurs in the region of 1@xmath460 , since the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction we used is effective only when there are many doubly occupied @xmath1- and @xmath0-sites .",
    "the conventional @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction significantly narrows the intermediate valent regime of 1@xmath460 , too .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the @xmath32 renormalization factor , since it is related to the effective mass ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ qf_ef : fig ] .",
    "the same effect can be seen here too , furthermore the heavy - fermion regime extends to smaller @xmath1-level energies .    in fig .",
    "[ qd_ef : fig ] the renormalization factor for the @xmath0-band is plotted . as it was outlined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qd_formula ] ) the @xmath0-electrons become correlated in the presence of @xmath21 , despite the fact that there is no direct @xmath0-@xmath0 coulomb interaction present in the model .",
    "the @xmath1-level renormalization factor as a function of the energy @xmath41 of the @xmath1-level at half - filling , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the continuous and dotted curves belong to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . ]",
    "the @xmath0-band renormalization factor as a function of the energy @xmath41 of the @xmath1-level at half - filling , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the continuous and dotted curves belong to @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . ]",
    "we have investigated an extended version of the usual periodic anderson model , where an additional repulsive interaction among the @xmath0 and @xmath1 electrons was taken into account .",
    "we have shown analytically that the conduction band is narrowed owing to the new interaction .",
    "we have demonstrated that a finite @xmath21 expands the regime of heavy - fermion character to a lower value of @xmath41 and narrows the intermediate valent regime at the same time .",
    "it is expected that the full @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction ( eq . ( [ conventional - udf ] ) ) has an even sharper effect .",
