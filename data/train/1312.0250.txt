    "recently a novel solution for the positron emission tomography scanner was proposed which utilizes plastic scintillators as detectors for the annihilation quanta  @xcite .",
    "a single detection unit of this detector is built out of a scintillator strip read out on both sides by photomultipliers .",
    "the position of the interaction of the gamma quanta inside a strip is determined based on the shape and time of photomultiplier signals .",
    "the shape of signals may be distorted by the secondary scattering of gamma quanta inside the scintillator .",
    "this is because a secondary scattering creates an additional light signal and as a result a light pulse reaching the photomultiplier is composed of overlaping signals originating from points of primary and secondary interactions .    in this article",
    "we estimate influence of the secondary scattering on the quality of hit position reconstruction in the pet detectors based on the plastic scintillators . to this end",
    "a dedicated simulation programme was elaborated and series of simulations have been performed .",
    "these allowed to determine multiplicity distributions of annihilation quanta interaction inside a scintillator strip , as well as distributions of distance between points of scattering .",
    "the obtained results are then interpreted in view of the distortion of spatial and temporal resolution of the detector due to the secondary interactions of registered gamma quanta .",
    "the main simulation algorithm is elaborated assuming that in plastic scintillators the annihilation gamma quanta with energy of about 511  kev , undergo a compton scattering only .",
    "main aim of the simulation was an estimation of number of gamma quanta interactions in a scintillator strip and determinantion of spatial distribution of scattering centers within the scintillator volume . for this purpose , we assume that gamma quantum originates in a certrain initial position with a user  defined four  momentum vector . description of scintillator is also provided by user and consists of : attenuation constant at energy for @xmath1 and dimensions of scintillator cuboid . from this input data attenuation constant at any energy is extrapolated using following formula : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes inverse of attenutation length , and @xmath4 stands for total cross section of gamma quantum at given energy @xmath5 .",
    "the values of cross sections have been extracted from  @xcite .",
    "a given number of events , @xmath6 , and maximum number of interactions in one event , @xmath7 , is also passed to algorithm , which may be in general described by a following scheme :    position @xmath8 initial position direction @xmath8 initial direction energy @xmath8 initial energy    @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 total cross section length @xmath8 random length of pdf @xmath12 position @xmath8 position + direction @xmath11 length end event polar angle @xmath8 random angle from klein - nishina pdf azimuthal angle @xmath8 random angle from izotropic pdf _ scatter _ direction vector using generated angles print position , deposited energy , time    as a result , collection of events containing ordered set of interactions , is obtained .",
    "the generation of varaiables used in the programme according to the given probability density function ( pdf ) is performed based on the distribution of a corresponding cumulative function , which is homogenous by definition .",
    "cumulative function ( @xmath13 ) of the angular probability density function is calculated based on the klein - nishina formula @xcite . in following equations",
    "it is factorized into @xmath14independent ( constant @xmath15 ) and @xmath14dependent functions , and other @xmath14independent function is added ( only relative changes to @xmath16 are important ; additive function is chosen to ensure that @xmath17 , which simplifies calculations ) : @xmath18\\\\ p(\\theta,\\gamma)&=\\frac { 1}{1+\\gamma(1-\\cos\\theta)}\\\\ \\gamma&=\\frac{e}{m_e c^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes energy of gamma quantum , and @xmath19 stands for the mass of electron . +",

    ", this vector must be rotated by rotation matrix around the z - axis @xmath36 by a random angle . generated vector must be re - transformed to original reference frame , and the final scattered vector is given by : @xmath37 the discussed rotations are visualized in fig .",

    "the gamma quantum passing through the matter may undergo various processes among which compton , rayleigh and photelectric effects are dominant for the energy range below 1 mev . for simulations of the interaction of annihilation",
    "quanta in a plastic scintillator we assumed the dominance of the compton effect and have neglected other processes since they can contribute significantly only for energies below 50 kev ( see fig .",

    "the energy of a gamma quantum may be expressed in terms of the _ reduced gamma quantum energy _ @xmath38 .",
    "such notation is especially convenient for calculations involving annihilations quanta for which @xmath39 . for further consideration",
    "it is useful to mention that @xmath40 for gamma quantum with energy of 50 kev .    in the scintillator strip annihilation gamma quantum",
    "may in principle undergo many compton scatterings and its minimum energy after @xmath41th interaction may be calculated based on the iterative formula : @xmath42        first terms of this series are @xmath43 .",
    "it shows , that up to 4th interaction energy of gamma quantum is above @xmath44 .",
    "it will be shown in the following sections that in the case of the scintillator strips of the j - pet detector a probability that the gamma quantum scatters more than three times is negligible .",
    "therefore , all efects other than compton scattering can be safely neglected .",
    "+ another assumption applied is the convexity of scintillator s shape : in such case if gamma quantum leaves scintillator , it will never come back and computations can stop .",
    "it is also certain ( from definition ) that line segment bounded by two points of interactions is inside scintillator s volume , which simplifies calculations of next interaction point .",
    "we have performed simulations assuming that the scintillator strip is a cuboid with dimensions of @xmath45 .",
    "the cross section of the strip corresponds to the size of the modules used for the first j - pet prototype , and its length was chosen arbitrarily large .",

    "the table indicates that more than 90@xmath0 of secondary scattering occurs for @xmath53 smaller than 1.4  cm .",
    "however , for the distortion of the signals not only a distance between interaction points is important , but also the energy deposited by the secondary ionisation .",
    "correlations between deposited energy and spatial separation of interaction points is shown in figures  [ fig : edxa][fig : edxc ] .",
    "these figures are however not 2d histograms ( i.e. heat maps ) , but sets of dense packed 1d histograms , in which each line ( sub  histogram ) is separately normalized in that way , that maximum value in each sub  histogram is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "the figures are made this way , because one may approximate total energy stored in scintillator , and could be interested in most probable @xmath53 in this event .",
    "it is important to mention that in this and following paragraph only events including at least two scatterings were taken into account .     as a function of total deposited energy .",

    "results presented in these figures indicate that in order to decrese the blurring of the signals due to the secondary scattering one can select from the full spectrum only these events for which deposited energy is larger than e.g.  0.2  @xmath19 and smaller than 0.7  @xmath19 . for each of the studied cases the broadest @xmath53 distributions",

    "the largest spread of @xmath53 is observed as expected for the case c , for which the primary gamma quantum can travel the longest distance along the scintillator . in this case",
    "a scattering under small angles resulting in a small energy depositions leads to the scatterd gamma quantum which , due to the relatively large energy , can travel on the average large distance before the second scattering , which may again occur at most probable under a small angle with a small energy deposition .",

    "the light signals are read out by photomulitpliers on both edges of the strip , therefore for one of them the signal distortion by the secondary scattering will be much smaller than for the other one .",
    "this is because , between primary and secondary scattering the gamma quantum propagates towards one of the photomulitpliers together with the primary light signal and therefore the signal distortion in this photomultiplier will be smaller than in the other edge where the delay between primary and secondary light pulses is equal to : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes difference of x  component of interactions positions , @xmath57 denotes their time difference and @xmath58 stands for the effective velocity of light signal propagation trough the scintillator . in this calculations @xmath58  =  14  cm / ns was used .",

    "an algorithm simulating chain of compton scatterings was elaborated and series of simulations have been conducted for the scintillator strip with the cross section of 5  mm x 20  mm .",
    "simulations were simplified due to the observation that for the energy range of interest the compton scattering is dominant and photoelectric and rayleigh effects may be neglected . as a result : ( i ) distributions of multiplicity of interactions , ( ii ) spatial distribution of interactions points as a function of the deposited energy , and ( iii ) spectra of time differences between subsequent interactions have been determined . obtained results",
