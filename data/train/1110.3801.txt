    "understanding galaxy formation and evolution remains one of the most outstanding questions in astronomy . according to the standard paradigm , galaxies are initially formed in the center of small cold dark matter halos , gradually assembled with time through hierarchical processes , and eventually evolved into populations with various color , size , morphology , etc .",
    ", as observed in our local universe @xcite",
    ". however , the physics behind this scenario is still poorly understood .",
    "theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require complex ingredients ( e.g. , using feedback to quench star formation in galaxies ) in addition to simple gas falling and cooling to reproduce even basic observations of nearby galaxies , such as luminosity function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and color bimodality ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since these ingredients are predicted ( or designed ) to begin to work since the universe is young , it is essential to test them through observational studies on the physical properties of high - redshift galaxies .    during the 13.7 billion years of cosmic time",
    ", the era of @xmath7 is of particular interest , in terms of star formation , stellar mass content , and galaxy morphology .",
    "first , although the increase of cosmic star formation rate density ( sfrd ) with redshift is well studied out to @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the question of whether the sfrd has a broad peak during @xmath9 is still far from being finally solved ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , if such a peak exists , what is the mechanism that turns off the bulk of star formation in the universe ?",
    "second , being related to the evolution of the sfrd , the assembly history of massive ( @xmath10 ) galaxies is still in question",
    ". a large number of massive galaxies is found at z@xmath12 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but only a few of them are found at z@xmath33.5 @xcite .",
    "this dearth of massive galaxies at high redshift raises the question of when and how these giants were largely assembled in the universe .",
    "last but not the least , the morphology of galaxies also undergoes a transition at z@xmath13 .",
    "although being studied in detail in the local universe and even traced back to z@xmath11.5 @xcite , the hubble sequence of galaxy morphology is not believed to be in place at z@xmath13 @xcite because a large fraction of galaxies in that epoch has irregular shapes ( chain - like , clumpy , multiple cores , etc . ) . therefore , the origin and emergence of the hubble sequence remains an open question . to answer all the above questions requires observational studies on the physical properties ( e.g. , star formation rate [ sfr ] , stellar mass , and morphology ) of galaxies at z@xmath13 .    high - redshift galaxies can be effectively selected from deep sky surveys through their broad - band colors .",
    "star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) at z@xmath13 and above are prevalently selected with the dropout method by locating the position of the lyman break from their rest - frame uv colors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this technique has been proved to be very successful because galaxies selected in this way , namely , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , are spectroscopically confirmed as sfgs at high redshift @xcite with little contamination .",
    "recently , this technique has been extended to select galaxies at 1.4@xmath5z@xmath52.5 ( bx / bm galaxies , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the lyman break technique misses one interesting galaxy population , namely dusty sfgs .",
    "how much this population contributes to the cosmic sfrd and number density of galaxies at z@xmath13 is still controversial .",
    "studies using far - ir or sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) emission from cold dust show that some dusty galaxies , for example sub - mm galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have sfrs up to @xmath11 .",
    "the high sfrs of dusty galaxies imply that the contribution of this population to the cosmic sfrd at z@xmath13 may not be ignored . to avoid underestimating the sfrd due to the exclusion of this population",
    ", a new color selection method is required to select sfgs independent of dust reddening .    besides dusty sfgs",
    ", passively evolving galaxies ( pegs ) at high redshift are also missed by the lyman break technique . although pegs contribute little to the sfrd , they are directly related to the ceasing of star formation in galaxies and to the history of stellar mass assembly in the universe . to search for this population , several color selection criteria have been proposed . among them ,",
    "the most commonly used two are the extremely red objects ( eros ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and distant red galaxies ( drgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "eros are selected with very red optical to near - ir color , typically @xmath12 , while drgs have a red near - ir color with @xmath13 .",
    "both methods use the red color as an indicator of the large amount of old stars in galaxies .",
    "however , due to the strong degeneracy between age and dust reddening , the red color of a galaxy could be caused by either old stars or high dust extinctions . as a result",
    ", samples selected by both methods contain both massive pegs and dusty sfgs with similar fractions , as showed by spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "to exclude the contamination of sfgs , a more efficient way of selecting pegs at z@xmath13 is needed .    a selection method that satisfies the above requirements already exists for galaxies at z@xmath12 , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "this method uses the b- , z- , and k - band photometry to select both sfgs and pegs at z@xmath12 .",
    "samples selected through the bzk method are now widely used to investigate several aspects of galaxies at z@xmath12 , from physical properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , abundance @xcite , stellar mass function @xcite , to clustering @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we try to design an analogous method that selects and classifies simultaneously both sfgs ( with different dust extinctions ) and pegs at 2.3@xmath5z@xmath53.5 . for this purpose , we extend the successful bzk method from z@xmath12 to z@xmath13 by replacing the selection bands with the v- , j- , and irac 3.6@xmath14 m band ( hereafter l - band ) , according to the relative shift of galaxy spectra between the two redshifts . our selection method ( hereafter vjl ) uses the same rest - frame colors as the bzk method so that galaxies selected by both methods have same spectral types .",
    "however , due to the different depth and sensitivities of the bands used in each method , the vjl selected sample may have different incompleteness and contamination from the bzk selected sample .",
    "nowadays , photometric redshift ( photo - z ) can be fairly accurately measured with relative error of only a few percent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is hence widely used to select galaxies within a certain redshift range . however , the bias of photo - z selection is not explicit .",
    "it is common to characterize photo - z errors with a redshift probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "the accuracy of the distribution function strongly depends on the assumed mix of galaxy templates in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) library .",
    "unfortunately , our knowledge on the true sed types is limited and the commonly used sed libraries are often not good representatives of real galaxies .",
    "let alone the mystery of dust extinction curve , initial mass function ( imf ) , metallicity of high - z galaxies , one major uncertainty of fitting high - z galaxies is the unknown star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "the commonly used exponentially declined sfh ( @xmath15-model ) may be a suitable approximation for low - z galaxies , but is not a realistic model for high - z galaxies .",
    "recently postulated hypotheses on sfh of high - z galaxies include exponentially increasing @xcite or roughly linearly increasing @xcite sfh . using an unrealistic sfh would eventually result in a mis - interpretation of the bias of photo - z selection .    on the other side",
    ", the bias of color selection can be fairly explicitly determined .",
    "one easy way to do so is applying the color criterion to simulated galaxies that have a certain range of redshift , sfhs and extinctions and calculating the success and failure rate of the selection .",
    "thus , one can robustly measure the expected redshift distribution as well as the incompleteness of the selection as a function of several variables , such as magnitude , size , and color of galaxies .",
    "moreover , color selection is easier to reproduce . unlike photo - z selections",
    ", results of which may vary from people to people , depending on the used sed - fitting codes or sed libraries , color selection results are robust and make the comparison of different works easy for the whole community .",
    "the success of color selection method has been proved by the prevalence of lyman break technique ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    ", we apply our vjl selection method to the hst / wfc3 early release science ( ers , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observations in the south field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) south field ( goods - s ) .",
    "serving as an ideal test field of our selection method , ers brings three advantages for us to calibrate and optimize our method .",
    "first , its deep ( @xmath127 ab mag ) j - band allows us to select galaxies that are faint in their rest - frame optical bands .",
    "these galaxies could be dusty sfgs and the ability to detect and correctly classify them is a key of our method .",
    "second , embedded within goods south field , ers is augmented by several existing data sets , from x - ray , optical , to mid - infrared band and sub - mm band .",
    "the multi - wavelength data enable us to accurately understand the nature of our selected galaxies .",
    "third , ers has similar depth on j- and h - bands as the upcoming candels observation @xcite so that our method calibrated in ers can be easily adapted to apply to candels data .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath16 cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 and use the hubble constant in terms of @xmath19 .",
    "all magnitudes in the paper are in ab scale @xcite unless otherwise noted .",
    "the ers observation @xcite covers 4050 @xmath20 of the goods south field in 10 bands .",
    "the data used in this work are its near - ir observations , i.e. , f098 m ( ys ) , f125w ( j ) , and f160w ( h ) images .",
    "the 50% completeness limit for 5-@xmath21 detections for typical compact objects ( circular aperture with radius of 0.4  ) is 27.2 , 27.55 , and 27.25 for ys , j , and h. we re - processed the images and drizzled them to a 0.06per pixel scale and registered to the goods wcs .",
    "the goods south field has been observed with various telescopes and instrument combinations , from x - ray to sub - mm and radio .",
    "relevant to our analysis here are imagings of very large telescope ( vlt)/vimos ultra - deep u - band @xcite , _",
    "bviz @xcite , vlt / isaac jhks @xcite , spitzer / irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.7 , 8.0 @xmath14 m ( m. dickinson et al . in preparation ) , and spitzer / mips 24 @xmath14 m . table [ tb : band ] summarizes the sensitivity ( limiting magnitude of s / n=5 for a point source ) and resolution , namely , the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of point - spread function ( psf ) , of each band used in this study .    in our work , we also try to select an lbg sample at z@xmath13 through the u - band dropout technique as a reference sample to compare to our vjl sample .",
    "the vlt / vimos u - band used in goods - s is blueward to the traditional u - band and would bias selected galaxies toward higher redshift . the other u - band in goods - s , namely the ctio u - band , is a traditional u - band , but the depth of its imaging is about 1.5 mag shallower than that of vimos u - band . in order to select a relatively complete u - band dropout sample at z@xmath13 , we turn to use the multi - wavelength catalog of the goods north field ( goods - n ) , where the kpno u - band imaging satisfies the requirements of being both traditional u - band and deep to valid our z@xmath13 lbg selection .",
    "besides having the kpno u - band and hst / acs and spitzer irac observations , goods - n also has the ground - based nir images observed through cfht wircam j- and k - band @xcite .",
    "we list their sensitivity and resolution , together with those of kpno u - band , in table [ tb : band ] .",
    ".sensitivity and resolution of goods filters [ tb : band ] [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the redshift distributions of galaxies in our final pvjl samples ( solid lines ) are shown in figure [ fig : pvjlzdist ] .",
    "comparison between samples with ( solid lines ) or without ( dotted lines ) the size criterion shows the efficiency of the additional size criterion on removing contamination from low redshift ( z@xmath52.0 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of our final sample peaks around z@xmath12.5 regardless the applied s / n cut .",
    "this distribution is a little lower than our expectation ( z@xmath13.0 ) but consistent with our previous analysis based on the color of stellar population synthetic models .",
    "as shown by the dotted line with squares in the left panel of figure [ fig : model ] , the track of ssp galaxy with t=1.0 gyr begins to enter our pvjl selection window at z@xmath12 .",
    "although the track stays in our pvjl selection window at higher redshift , the number density of pegs is expected to decline with redshift . as a result , it is not surprising that the redshift distribution peaks at a point where the number density of galaxies is still high and the photometric uncertainty can not easily scatter galaxies out of the selection window .",
    "recently , pegs are occasionally found at z@xmath33 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these galaxies contain important information of when and how galaxies stopped their star formation activity .",
    "their number density , or even their existence itself , can set strong constraints on current theories of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "six galaxies in our s / n@xmath35 sample are at z@xmath33 .",
    "although they do not enter our s / n@xmath320 sample because of the low s / n of their rest - frame optical photometry , it is still intriguing to study their physical properties and examine if they are real pegs at z@xmath33 .",
    "table [ tb : pvjlz3 ] summarizes the best - fit parameters of the six high - z peg candidates .",
    "the ages of five galaxies are significantly ( at least five times ) older than their characteristic star - formation time - scale ( @xmath22 ) , suggesting that they have already passed their star - formation peaks and become quiescent . only one galaxy ( i d 3222 ) is fitted as a dusty star - burst galaxy with sfr @xmath3 1000 m@xmath23/yr .",
    "although the best - fit parameters support the passive natures of the majority of our candidates , the sed - fitting procedure , which only uses the rest - frame uv to nir data , suffers from the age ",
    "dust degeneracy and is hence not capable of perfectly distinguishing dusty star - forming and old populations .",
    "if we assume that these galaxies are forming stars and that their red rest - frame uv colors are caused by dust obscuration rather than old stellar populations , their e(b - v)s and obscuration corrected sfrs measured from their rest - frame uv continuum slopes would be much higher than the sed - fitting derived values , with all e(b - v)s@xmath30.3 and sfr on average a few hundred times higher than the best sed - fitting values .",
    "such high e(b - v)s and sfrs together suggest that these galaxies should have significant dust emission exists in longer wavelength ( e.g. , rest - frame ir and sub - mm ) , where dust emission dominates the radiative spectrum , if their dusty star - forming nature is true .",
    "figure [ fig : passsed ] shows the best - fit stellar population seds ( solid line ) of the six galaxies . for comparison ,",
    "we also plot templates of the sfgs ( dotted line ) retrieved from the templates of @xcite .",
    "the star - forming templates are not chosen by fitting to rest - frame uv and optical data to models .",
    "instead , we calculate the obscured sfr ( total sfr minus unobscured sfr ) of these galaxies from their rest - frame uv continuum , assuming they are dusty sfgs .",
    "then , for each galaxy , we convert the obscured sfr to the bolometric ir luminosity and choose the template whose bolometric ir luminosity best matches the luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to find from the plot that although we do not fit the templates to the rest - frame uv and optical data , the templates match the data fairly well ( except galaxy 3222 ) .",
    "the best chosen template gives us an estimate of the fluxes from dust emission , which , if existing , can be observed by our current mips 24 @xmath14 m , goods-_herschel _ ( pi elbaz ) 100 and 160 @xmath14 m , and aztec 1.1 mm observations @xcite .    at such high",
    "redshift , dust emission within the mips 24 @xmath14 m bandpass is still comparable to the stellar emission , as the stellar emission peak is just a little blueward of the mips bandpass . as seen from the plot , in four out of six galaxies , the mips 24 @xmath14 m fluxes can not help distinguish old and dusty populations at all . in two galaxies ( 2414 and 2454 ) , the observed 24 @xmath14 m fluxes lean toward the prediction of dust emission , however , the prediction of pure stellar emission is still within the 3@xmath21 level of the observation and can not be fully ruled out .    in principle , goods-_herschel _ and aztec data can be effective at distinguishing pegs from dusty sfgs by sampling the blackbody radiation of cold dust .",
    "unfortunately , the detection thresholds of these surveys are so high that the fluxes of dusty templates in figure [ fig : passsed ] are almost all under their 1@xmath21 detection limits . indeed",
    ", flux measurements of individual galaxies in the aztec image suffer from a very low s / n , @xmath24 , being comparable to the noise level . due to the high detection thresholds , we can not conclude that if the non - detections in the aztec image provide a tight constraint on the nature of our candidates .",
    "however , as shown in the figure , the predicted dust emission from three or four dusty star - forming templates is touching the 1@xmath21 detection limit of these long - wavelength bands .",
    "we expect an at least a 2@xmath21 detection in the stacked images if _ all _ our galaxies are dusty sfgs . in the stacked aztec image , we detect a signal with s / n=1.1 in the central pixels ( with size of 3 ) , still comparable to noise .",
    "such low s /",
    "n in the stacked aztec image suggests that at least some of our candidates are not dusty sfgs but real pegs at z@xmath33 .",
    "it also rule out our suspicion that galaxy 3233 has sfr over 1000 m@xmath23/yr , as its best sed - fitting shows in table [ tb : pvjlz3 ] .",
    "such huge sfr should have been easily detected in the aztec image .",
    "we also use the chandra deep 4ms x - ray image of cdfs to examine if agn host galaxies contaminate our peg candidates at z@xmath33 .",
    "none of our candidates is individually detected in the 4ms chandra catalog of @xcite .",
    "the stacked images in both soft and hard bands show signals comparable to noises , with an s / n of 1.75 and 1.17 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that our peg candidates at z@xmath33 are not contaminated by agn host galaxies .",
    "we note that the two galaxies with the highest redshifts ( 5218 and 8124 ) have the largest sfrs .",
    "their best - fit sfrs are comparable to that of our milky way , while their stellar masses are lower than that of milky way .",
    "the ssfr of these galaxies are higher than @xmath25 , the usual value used to distinguish sfgs and pegs .",
    "we suspect that it is possible that although these galaxies have passed their peaks of star formation , their star formation activity has not yet been fully ceased",
    ". they could be in a transition stage from star forming to fully quiescent , since their rest - frame uv and optical light is already dominated by old stellar populations . at lower redshift ( z@xmath53.5 ) ,",
    "galaxies all have ssfr less than @xmath25 , very well fit to the usual criterion of pegs .",
    "we speculate that galaxies in the universe begin to transit from star forming to quiescent stages at z@xmath14.5 and become fully ceased pegs at z@xmath13.5",
    ". however , the fact of increasing sfr with redshift could also be due to a selection effect of a flux - limited sample , because sfr increases with luminosity so that galaxies with higher sfrs can be observed out to higher redshift .",
    "deep and large nir band survey , such as candels , is required to observe galaxies down to a fainter luminosity ( hence lower sfr ) level to provide a more accurate sed - fitting results to reveal the secret of when galaxies began to cease their star formation .",
    "the integrated stellar mass density ( ismd ) of pegs is a key parameter for understanding the formation and evolution of the galaxies .",
    "it quantifies how many stars have been locked in passive systems at a given cosmic epoch .",
    "currently , most studies on the evolution of stellar mass function and stellar mass density focus on all ( both star - forming and passively evolving ) massive galaxies at z@xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only few works @xcite have been devoted to the study of the evolution of pegs ( or quiescent galaxies ) only , partly due to the difficulty of identifying these galaxies at high redshift .",
    "however , the evolution of the passive population only is as important as that of all populations together , because it records when and how stars migrate from the star - forming population to passive population , which are critical for us to understand the physics that governs the ongoing and ceasing of star formation activity in the universe .",
    "in this section , we estimate the ismd at 2@xmath5z@xmath53 using our clean pvjl samples .",
    "the precise measurement of the function should be obtained by integrating the stellar mass function , either the analytic schechter form or the stepwise one .",
    "however , our small number samples ( only 14 pvjls even in the s / n@xmath35 sample ) limit our ability to obtain an accurate measurement of the stellar mass function at 2@xmath5z@xmath53 .",
    "we leave such an accurate measurement to a forthcoming paper ( y. guo et al . in prep . ) that employs the advantage of the large survey area of the upcoming candels . in this paper , instead , we simply carry out a shortcut measurement of the ismd to its first - order accuracy .",
    "we calculate the ismd as follow : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the stellar mass , @xmath28 is the observed number of galaxies with stellar mass @xmath27 and redshift @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the differential cosmic volume at @xmath29 .",
    "the lower and upper limits of the integral over @xmath29 are 2 and 3 , while the lower limit of the integral over @xmath27 is @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 is a factor to correct the incompleteness caused by observation and selection for galaxies with @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "as referred from figure [ fig : pvjlzdist ] , the redshift distributions of our pvjl samples are very well peaked around z@xmath12.5 and have a narrow scatter . therefore , it is safe to assume that @xmath32 is primarily dominated by @xmath27 and only has a weak relation on @xmath29 in our sample .",
    "we choose z=2.5 for calculation @xmath32 for all pvjls . the uncertainty induced by such an assumption is less than that induced by the measurement of stellar mass of galaxies . under this assumption ,",
    "we place an ssp model with age of 1 gyr and stellar mass @xmath27 at z=2.5 and perturb its v- , j- and l - band photometry using gaussian random deviation with the variance set equal to a photometric error that is randomly drawn from the distribution of observed photometric uncertainties for a given magnitude of a given band in our multi - wavelength catalog .",
    "the perturbation is repeated 1000 times and for each time we justify whether the perturbed galaxy can be selected as a pvjl according to our criterion , equation [ eq : pvjl ] , and different s / n cuts .",
    "the factor @xmath32 is defined the reciprocal of the rate of successful selections .",
    "the ismd of our pvjls at 2@xmath5z@xmath53 is shown in figure [ fig : massdense ] , together with measurements for lower redshift from other studies @xcite .",
    "we measure the ismd for each of our three samples with different s / n cut and plot the mean and standard deviation of the three samples . as shown by the filled point with error bars at z@xmath12.5 ,",
    "the 1@xmath21 deviation of the three samples is about 0.2 dex , comparable to the typical stellar mass uncertainty obtained through sed - fitting at such redshift .",
    "the small deviation also demonstrates that the incompleteness is fairly accurately estimated for our samples so that the ismds of samples with different mass limits that are induced by different s / n cuts are in very good agreement .    to further test the reliability of our measurement of the ismd",
    ", we apply our method to galaxies that are selected from goods - s using the passively evolving criterion of the bzk method ( pbzk ; * ? ? ?",
    "the redshift distribution of pbzks peaks at z@xmath11.5 , where a number of measurements of the ismd @xcite can be used as references to test the accuracy of our measurement .",
    "for pbzks , we choose an ssp model with age of 2 gyr at z=1.5 , perturb its b- , z- and k - band photometry according to photometric uncertainties , and calculate the ismd with the same formula as we use for pvjls .",
    "we also calculate the ismd using three pbzk samples with different s / n thresholds at z- and k - bands ( s / n@xmath35 , 10 , and 20 ) . thanks to the relatively large number of galaxies in each sample , the ismd of different pbzk samples agree with each other better than that of different pvjl samples , with the standard deviation less than 0.1 dex .",
    "figure [ fig : massdense ] illustrates the evolution of the ismd of pegs from z@xmath33 to z=0 .",
    "we compile measurements of several previous studies and compare them with our results . in particular , we take the best - fit schechter parameters by @xcite and integrate their schechter functions down to mass limit @xmath33 .",
    "we also take the ismd listed in the tables of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the ismd of pegs at 1.3@xmath5z@xmath52.0 in hudf measured by @xcite and the measurement from one of our companion paper @xcite are also plotted .",
    "all adopted measurements are scaled to match our salpeter imf with the following relations : @xmath34 @xcite and @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "@xcite also compared stellar masses measured with different stellar synthesis libraries , i.e. , bc03 , cb09 , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m05 ) and found the following relations : @xmath36 at all redshift ; @xmath37 at z@xmath51.5 ; and + @xmath38 at 1.5@xmath5z@xmath54 .",
    "we use these relations to scale stellar masses in other works to cb09 .",
    "our ismd at z@xmath11.5 ( pbzk ) agrees well with that of quiescent galaxies of @xcite , with difference less than 0.1 dex .",
    "however , our ismd deviates from other studies at z@xmath11.5 by a few tenth dex .",
    "@xcite constructed a fairly complete and clean sample by using not only ssfr but also morphology and mips 24 @xmath14 m flux .",
    "their ismd should suffer the least from incompleteness and contamination .",
    "however , their field , namely the ers field , is occupied by an over - dense large - scale structure at z@xmath11.6 @xcite , which might boost the ismd upward .",
    "@xcite used only a small sample ( six galaxies ) over the 12.2 arcmin@xmath39 hudf area so that their result may suffer from both small number statistics and large cosmic variance .",
    "the scheme of separating quiescent and dusty sfgs by two rest - frame colors of @xcite may induce into their quiescent sample a fraction of dusty contamination , which could partly explain the largest ismd at z@xmath11.5 measured by them . despite the discrepancy , ismds at z@xmath11.5 measured by different authors scatter around the best fit of the evolution of ismd of pegs at 1@xmath5z@xmath53 ( solid line in the plot ) within @xmath10.3 dex , which is just slightly larger than the typical uncertainty of deriving stellar mass through sed - fitting at this redshift ( @xmath10.2 dex ) .",
    "this suggests that the uncertainty of stellar mass is the dominant source of ismd uncertainty , and that our simplified incompleteness correction is accurate to the first order . only our work and @xcite measure the ismd of pegs at z@xmath12.5 .",
    "the ismd of @xcite is 0.2 dex lower than that of ours , again within the typical uncertainty of stellar mass . besides the stellar mass uncertainty",
    ", the discrepancy could also be due to the fact that @xcite only integrate their stellar mass function at z@xmath32.0 down to @xmath40 , whereas the stellar mass function of pegs is dominated by galaxies around @xmath41 , typically @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we even extend our measurement to z@xmath33 , where we only have a few peg candidates though .",
    "we measure the ismd for three candidates at 3@xmath5z@xmath53.5 using an ssp model of 1 gyr at z=3.3 and the ismd for the other three candidates at z@xmath34 using an ssp model of 0.5 gyr at z=4.5 . since there might be contamination of dusty sfgs among our candidates ( as discussed in ",
    "[ pvjl : highz ] ) , the ismds at z@xmath33 can be only treated as an upper limit .",
    "the upper limit of ismd at z@xmath33 was also measured by @xcite , who found 21 z@xmath33.5 quiescent candidates which are selected at irac 4.5 @xmath14 m channel but have no mips 24 @xmath14 m detection in goods - n .",
    "as argued by them as well as indicated by figure [ fig : passsed ] , the lack of 24 @xmath14 m emission is a necessary but insufficient condition for determining a galaxy to be quiescent .",
    "our upper limit of isdm at z@xmath33 is about 0.3 dex lower than that of theirs ( also shown in figure [ fig : massdense ] ) , but still within the error bars of their upper limit . in this sense ,",
    "the two measurements are not inconsistent .",
    "the evolution of ismd of pegs can be easily converted into the evolution of fraction of stellar mass in pegs , if an underlying global stellar mass density ( gsmd ) is measured for all types of galaxies .",
    "we obtain such a measurement by fitting a linear relation to the evolution of gsmd ( log(gsmd ) versus redshift ) of figure 12 of @xcite , which compiles measurements of gsmd from several previous studies .",
    "we then divide the ismd of pegs by the gsmd at a given redshift to obtain the fraction of stellar mass in pegs .",
    "the evolution of the mass fraction is shown in figure [ fig : massseg ] . at z@xmath33 ,",
    "the mass fraction of pegs is less than 5% .",
    "this fraction then increases from 5% to about 40% from z=3 to z=1 . however , there is large discrepancy among measurements of the fraction at z@xmath12 , from 5% of our study and @xcite to 25% of @xcite .",
    "the reason of such large discrepancy , as discussed above in the measurement of ismd , is complicated , possibly due to sample selection , stellar mass density measurement method , and/or cosmic variance .",
    "a more accurate measure is needed in future to constrain this fraction and hence the mechanisms that are responsible for quenching the star formation activity during the peak of the cosmic sfrd .",
    "it should also be noted that there is about 0.2 dex deviation for the gsmd at z@xmath12 measured by different authors ( see figure 12 of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the accurate measurement of stellar mass fraction in pegs requires an improvement on measuring the stellar mass densities of both pegs and all types of galaxies .",
    "our work does not provide measurement on the mass fraction at z@xmath51 , but we still plot the measurements of other authors for readers to obtain a sight of the evolution trend in lower redshift .      the evolution of ismd of pegs can be schematically divided into three stages , as indicated by the vertical dashed lines in figure [ fig : massseg ] .",
    "the physical mechanisms that govern the formation and evolution of pegs in each stage may be different .    the first stage ( z@xmath33 ) could be called as the formation ( or present ) stage .",
    "the existence of pegs in the stage is still controversial @xcite . in our study , we find six candidates at z@xmath33 .",
    "individual and stack analysis of the sub - mm aztec images show that at least some of them could be really passive .",
    "we can not , however , draw a firm conclusion on which one is real passive .",
    "if we treat the ismd that we measured at z@xmath33 as an upper limit , the ismd grows by a factor of 10 , or even larger in 1 gyr from z@xmath14 to z@xmath12.5 .",
    "the existence of pegs of age of 1 gyr at z@xmath13.5 suggests that these galaxies begin to form their stars at z@xmath45 or 6 . due to the small sample and limited information",
    ", we can not discuss the formation mechanism of these galaxies .",
    "future studies in the following two aspects would shed a light on this question : ( 1 ) confirming or excluding the passive properties of our candidates by using other facilities and ( 2 ) exploiting larger and deeper nir survey ( e.g. , candels ) to construct a large sample with a good statistics .",
    "the second stage ( 1@xmath5z@xmath53 ) is the rapid growth stage , during which the ismd of pegs grows by a factor of 10 in 3.5 gyr .",
    "stars are extensively formed in or migrated into passive systems in this period .",
    "this stage is coincident with the broad peak of the cosmic sfrd ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the formation of stars and the migration of stars from star - forming systems to passive systems are happening simultaneously during this epoch .",
    "@xcite studied the size distribution of pegs during this stage and found @xmath180% of pegs at z@xmath11.5 are compact .",
    "the mechanisms that are responsible for the rapid mass growth of pegs ( e.g. , gas - rich major merger , collapse of unstable disks and monolithic collapse ) also tend to produce passive remnants that are compact and small with respect to local early - type galaxies .",
    "the third stage ( z@xmath51 ) is the slow growth stage , during which the ismd only increases by a factor of @xmath13 in @xmath17 gyr .",
    "this suggests that the majority of pegs has already been formed before this stage .",
    "this stage happens when the cosmic sfrd begins to rapidly decline from its peak ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that newly formed stars may not be enough for explaining the steady growth of the passive systems from z=1 to z=0 .",
    "it requires stars that already formed in other systems to migrate into the passive systems . a joint analysis of stellar mass density , number density , and size distribution of pegs in this stage by @xcite found that the number density increases by a factor of 1.5 from z=1 to z=0.5 , while the ismd keeps almost constant at the same time .",
    "and the average size of pegs increases by a factor of about 2.5 in the same epoch .",
    "these findings imply that the mechanisms that increase pegs sizes during this redshift range would not significantly increase their stellar masses , most likely being minor merges and slow accretion @xcite .",
    "also , the newly formed pegs that increase the number density at this time would have small stellar masses and larger sizes than those formed at z@xmath51 , indicating a different formation mechanism .",
    "in this paper , we introduce a new method of selecting both sfgs and pegs at @xmath0 using rest - frame uv - optical ( v - j versus j - l ) colors .",
    "we apply our vjl criteria to select galaxies in the wfc3 ers field and study the physical properties of the selected galaxies .",
    "we also discuss the implications of our selected galaxies on galaxy formation and evolution , especially the contribution of dusty sfgs to the cosmic sfrd at z@xmath13 and the evolution of ismd of pegs .",
    "the paper is summarized below .",
    "our vjl criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar population synthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the tests show that our criteria for sfgs ( equation [ eq : svjl ] , svjl ) is able to select galaxies with constant or exponentially declining sfh independently of their dust reddening . our criteria for pegs ( equation [ eq : pvjl ] , pvjl ) can select galaxies with properties similar to ssp models around z@xmath12.5 and above .",
    "the tests also show that , however , ( 1 ) the main source of contamination in our svjl sample is the sfgs at z@xmath12 and z@xmath43.5 and ( 2 ) contamination in our pvjl sample is mainly from dusty sfgs at z@xmath12 .",
    "we apply our svjl criterion to the wfc3 ers field to select 354 and 146 galaxies with j- and l - band s / n cuts greater than 10 and 20 .",
    "the redshift distribution of our svjl sample peaks at z@xmath12.7 .",
    "however , it also has a secondary peak around z@xmath11.8 .",
    "this secondary peak is induced by the color uncertainty , as the power of the secondary peak decreases with the increase of the s / n threshold .",
    "we compare our svjls with lyman break galaxies at z@xmath13 ( u - band dropouts ) , assuming that the slight difference in the peak redshifts ( @xmath43 for svjls and @xmath44 for u - band dropouts ) would not result in any significant difference of properties of the two samples . in the ers field ,",
    "39% of u - band dropouts are outside our svjl selection window . among the outsiders ,",
    "63% of them have redshift greater than 3.2 , where our svjl selection ability drops sharply .    unlike the lyman break technique",
    ", our svjl method can select galaxies whose ( j - l ) color redder than 2.0 , which implies high dust extinction in these galaxies .",
    "the measurement of e(b - v)s from the rest - frame uv continuum shows that u - band dropouts all have e(b - v)@xmath50.4 , while the distribution of e(b - v)s of svjls extended to e(b - v)@xmath11.0 .",
    "we evaluate the fraction of contamination from old galaxies in our sample of dusty sfgs ( e(b - v)@xmath30.3 ) by comparing their observed 24 @xmath14 m fluxes to that predicted by an ssp model .",
    "we find that 18% of our galaxies have 24 @xmath14 m fluxes that match the prediction of pure stellar emission .",
    "the low fraction of contamination indicates that our svjl method is effective at selecting dusty galaxies around z@xmath13 .",
    "the dusty ( e(b - v)@xmath30.4 ) galaxies selected by svjls reside in the massive end ( @xmath45)of the mass distribution of svjls .",
    "although they only counts for @xmath120% of the number density in the mass bin @xmath46 , they contribute about half of the star formation in this mass range . in the low - mass end @xmath47 , svjls and lbgs",
    "have no obvious difference on their color , e(b - v ) , and sfr .",
    "we also apply our criteria to the wfc3 ers field to select pegs at z@xmath13 . through a similar comparison between the observed and predicted mips 24 @xmath14 m fluxes , however , we find that our pvjl samples are heavily contaminated by dusty sfgs .",
    "an additional condition is needed to clean the samples .",
    "inspired by the fact that the majority of pegs at z@xmath32 is compact , we require galaxies to have a small radius ( j - band kron radius less than 1.0 ) to enter our pvjl sample .",
    "this extra criterion is proved to be able to effectively separate passive and dusty galaxies in our samples .",
    "the redshift distribution of our clean pvjl samples peaks at z@xmath12.5 and extends to z@xmath13 , and even to z@xmath34 when low s / n cuts are employed .",
    "we carry out case studies to examine the physical properties of our peg candidates at z@xmath33 .",
    "most of these galaxies have very low sfrs derived through sed - fitting but high sfrs derived from their rest - frame uv continuum .",
    "we try to use observations at longer wavelengths ( mips , herschel and aztec ) to break the age ",
    "dust degeneracy and understand the nature of these galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the detection limits of these long - wavelength observations are too high to help achieve a firm conclusion . however , we find no significant detection even in the stacked image of aztec , suggesting that some our candidates are real pegs at z@xmath33 .",
    "we speculate that galaxies with very low sfr , possibly a transition stage from star - forming to passive , begin to exist at z@xmath34 and pegs begin to exist at z@xmath33 .",
    "we estimate the ismd of pegs at z@xmath12.5 by using our clean pvjl sample .",
    "we evaluate the incompleteness of observation and selection in a simplified way , which is proved to be accurate to the first order by comparing our results with other studies as well as by comparing results of samples with different s / n cuts .",
    "we also extend our measurement to z@xmath33 and obtain a constraint on the ismd at z@xmath33 . combining this with low - redshift observations from previous studies , we find that the evolution of the ismd can be divided into three stages : ( 1 ) formation stage ( z@xmath33 ) , when pegs begin to form and their ismd grows by at least a factor of 10 in 1 gyr ; ( 2 ) rapid growth stage ( 1@xmath5z@xmath6 ) , when the ismd of pegs grows by another factor of 10 in 3.5 gyr ; and ( 3 ) slow growth stage ( z@xmath51 ) , when the ismd of pegs grows by a factor of 3 in 7 gyr .",
    "we discuss the possible mechanisms that drive the growth in each stage .",
    "we conclude that our new color selection criteria are effective at selecting sfgs independent of dust reddening as well as pegs at z@xmath13 .",
    "this method is less model - dependent and easier to reproduce than methods based on sed - fitting so that it can be quickly applied to upcoming large optical and nir surveys , such as candels , where large samples obtained through wide survey areas would set stronger constraints and shed new light on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "<S> a new set of color selection criteria ( vjl ) analogous with the bzk method is designed to select both star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) and passively evolving galaxies ( pegs ) at @xmath0 by using rest - frame uv  optical ( v - j vs. j - l ) colors . </S>",
    "<S> the criteria are thoroughly tested with theoretical stellar population synthesis models and real galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts to evaluate their efficiency and contamination . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the well - tested vjl criteria to the hst / wfc3 early release science field and study the physical properties of selected galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift distribution of selected sfgs peaks at z@xmath12.7 , slightly lower than that of lyman break galaxies at z@xmath13 . comparing the observed mid - infrared fluxes of selected galaxies with the prediction of pure stellar emission </S>",
    "<S> , we find that our vjl method is effective at selecting massive dusty sfgs that are missed by the lyman break technique . </S>",
    "<S> about half of the star formation in massive ( @xmath2 ) galaxies at @xmath0 is contributed by dusty ( extinction e(b - v)@xmath30.4 ) sfgs , which however , only account for @xmath120% of the number density of massive sfgs . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the mid - infrared fluxes to clean our peg sample , and find that galaxy size can be used as a secondary criterion to effectively eliminate the contamination of dusty sfgs . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift distribution of the cleaned peg sample peaks at z@xmath12.5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find six peg candidates at z@xmath33 and discuss possible methods to distinguish them from dusty contamination . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that at least part of our candidates are real pegs at z@xmath13 , implying that this type of galaxies began to form their stars at z@xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the integrated stellar mass density ( ismd ) of pegs at z@xmath12.5 and set constraints on it at z@xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ismd grows by at least about factor of 10 in 1 gyr at 3@xmath5z@xmath55 and by another factor of 10 in next 3.5 gyr ( 1@xmath5z@xmath6 ) . </S>"
