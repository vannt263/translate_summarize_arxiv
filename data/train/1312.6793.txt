    "in the main body of the article , we provided our variational estimates for the magnon - magnon scattering lengths in all three total spin sectors for the spin-1 heisenberg antiferromagnet . in this supplemental material",
    "we provide more detailed data on the basis of which we were able to estimate the precision for the given values .",
    "first of all , we comment on the two parameters @xmath63 and @xmath31 that were introduced to solve the scattering problem . as all matrix elements in the effective hamiltonian and norm matrix decay exponentially when going away from the diagonal , _ i.e. _ @xmath64 with @xmath65 the correlation length of the ground state .",
    "for the spin-1 heisenberg chain @xmath66 gives quantitatively correct results .",
    "the right value of the parameter @xmath31 is somewhat harder to predict , but from our simulations it is clear that from @xmath67 the results are quantitatively correct . as these values are easily attained , no systematic errors are produced from having to work with finite @xmath63 and @xmath31 .",
    "a second possible source of error is the linear fit for the scattering phase .",
    "the scattering length is determined as the slope of the scattering phase @xmath34 in function of the relative momentum @xmath50 . in fig .",
    "[ slope ] we plot @xmath34 for very small relative momenta , showing that the linearity is reproduced up to very high precision .",
    "we can safely say that no significant error results from doing the linear fit .    the scattering phase for small relative momenta in the sector with total spin @xmath47 with bond dimension @xmath68 .",
    "the slope of the linear fit is given in the above table , the intercept has absolute value @xmath69 and the norm of the residuals is @xmath70 . ]    in all matrix product state calculations the parameter that controls the accuracy of the variational approximation is the bond dimension @xmath7 . to get an estimate of the variational error , we should compare results for the scattering lengths for different @xmath7 ( see table [ scatlength ] ) .",
    "since there is no variational principle for the scattering length in our framework , we do not expect monotonic behaviour .",

    "it is well known that , when applying a magnetic field @xmath60 to the heisenberg chain , the ground state is unaffected until the field reaches a critical value @xmath72 equal to the mass gap @xmath73 . beyond this critical field a density of magnons is formed , for which the magnetic field serves as a chemical potential @xmath74 ( magnon interactions keep the density finite ) .    the magnetization curve in the main body of the article was obtained by writing down the bethe ansatz wave function as an approximate description of the finite density of magnons , and solving the corresponding bethe equations numerically @xcite . in first quantization ( system with @xmath63 particles ) , this wave function can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 if the permutations @xmath77 and @xmath78 differ by the interchange of the momenta @xmath79 and @xmath80 ; @xmath81 is the s matrix for the scattering of two particles with momenta @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which we can calculate with our variational method .",
    "imposing periodic boundary conditions on this wave function leads to the bethe equations , which , upon going to the thermodynamic limit , is transformed into a linear integral equation for the density of particles in momentum space @xmath82 where the kernel of the integral equation is given by the derivative of the scattering phase , _",

    "the value of the fermi momentum is fixed by demanding that @xmath90 and can be obtained numerically .",
    "the density of magnons ( _ i.e. _ the magnetization ) is then calculated with @xmath91    luttinger liquid parameters for the magnetized spin chain can be obtained by calculating the sound velocity and the compressibility based on this approximate bethe ansatz description .",
    "we can determine the sound velocity of the system @xmath92 by calculating the momentum and energy of elementary excitations close to the fermi level .",
    "a particle excitation with bethe momentum @xmath93 has physical momentum @xmath94 and energy @xmath95 the compressibility can be calculated easily as @xmath96 the sound velocity and the compressibility can be directly linked to the two luttinger liquid parameters @xcite .",
    "in this section we present some preliminary results for the application of our methods to spin ladders .",
    "we will look at the two - leg antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 ladder , given by the hamiltonian @xmath97 where @xmath98 denote the two legs of the ladder and the @xmath99 are spin-1/2 operators .",
    "the model is determined by the ratio @xmath100 .",
    "the lowest - lying elementary excitation is again a triplet with mimimum around @xmath36 , so we can study the scattering of these particles .",
    "depending on the parameter @xmath101 bound states may form .    in fig .",
    "[ dispersion ] the elementary excitation spectrum is shown for two specific values for @xmath101 and in fig .",
    "[ ladder1 ] we have plotted the phase shifts for two excitations within the @xmath42 sector .      as the scattering length determines leading - order corrections to some interesting properties , we calculated this quantity for different values of the parameter ratio @xmath101 . the results in fig .",

    "<S> we believe that our methods open up new routes towards a better understanding of the low - lying dynamics of ( quasi- ) one - dimensional quantum spin systems .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our methods can be straightforwardly applied to more interesting systems such as _ e.g. _ spin ladders and dimerized chains beyond the strong - coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> our formalism can be extended to topologically non - trivial excitations , so we can study _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ spinon interactions in half - integer spin chains , and bound states , which correspond to solutions of the scattering problem without any non - decaying asymptotic solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we might also study systems at finite temperature , using semiclassical approximations @xcite , the thermodynamic bethe ansatz and/or form - factor expansions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , as we have shown to give an accurate microscopic description of the interactions of elementary excitations , we are able to build an effective theory of interacting particlelike excitations for capturing the low - energy physics of generic spin chains . by gradually averaging out the microscopic details of the interactions , we can systematically make the connection to previous effective field theories based on phenomenological considerations and symmetries , globally determined parameters and/or strong- or weak - coupling limits .    </S>",
