    "this poses a formidable numerical task that we hope to address in future work . ) in summary , the relaxation of the dcp from a maximally occupied state is similar to that of the pure model during the initial stage , in which correlations have yet to grow to the size of the system .",
    "but afterward the evolution follows nonuniversal power laws ( or modified power laws ) and we can not define a characteristic lifetime .",
    "in this section we propose a simple explanation for how logarithmic time - dependence arises in the critical dcp .",
    "consider the survival probability @xmath5 starting from a single occupied site or seed located at the origin , @xmath129 .",
    "clearly , the trials that contribute to @xmath5 at large @xmath7 are those in which the seed happens to fall in a large , favorable region . to make the notion of a",

    "such regions are characterized by an ",
    "effective distance from criticality \" @xmath132 .",

    "it remains to estimate the probability @xmath140 that @xmath129 belongs to a domain of @xmath133 sites . to do this , note that a domain is a kind of percolation cluster .",
    "the precise definition of the sites in this percolation problem is unclear ( we might imagine averaging over small blocks of sites in the original lattice ) , as is the connectivity rule ( next - nearest neighbor blocks , for example , might effectively be connected ) .",
    "but we should expect the associated percolation model to be isotropic and of finite range .",
    "moreover , domain percolation must be _ critical _ at @xmath58 .",
    "if it were supercritical , the contact process would be able to spread into an unbounded domain , and so would itself be supercritical . similarly ,",
    "if domains were subcritical , their size distribution would decay exponentially , and the cp would be subcritical . at critical ,",
    "the domain size is power - law distributed : @xmath141 for large @xmath133 , with @xmath142 the usual percolation cluster - size exponent ( @xmath143 in two dimensions ) . combining this result with the lifetime estimate",
    ", we have @xmath144 as in the argument ( sec .",
    "iii ) for the survival probability starting from a maximally occupied state , the effect of inhomogeneity in the disorder is greatly oversimplified .",
    "inserting the known values of @xmath1 and of @xmath142 , we obtain @xmath145 , whereas the exponent we observed in simulations @xcite is much larger , and _",
    "nonuniversal , _ ranging from about 2.7 at @xmath146 to 4.6 at @xmath94 .",
    "thus we offer the above argument without any claim of quantitative validity , but rather to show how a simple treatment of disorder leads naturally to logarithmic time - dependence , and in the hope that it may form the basis for a more convincing approach .",
    "the probabilistic arguments suggest that it may be possible to understand how anomalous dynamics arises from an average over disorder . here",
    "it is important to recall noest s analysis of contributions from exponentially rare , favorable disorder configurations to the survival probability @xmath5 . by deriving upper and lower bounds on the survival probability",

    "arguments of a somewhat similar nature were advanced by bray in his discussion of the relaxation of diluted spin models @xcite .",
    "we have found that some aspects of the diluted contact process exhibit the same sort of critical behavior  albeit with different exponents  as seen in the pure model . other features",
    " spreading from a seed , the density - density autocorrelation function , @xmath96 , and the survival probability @xmath148 , starting from a maximally occupied state  do not follow the usual scaling , and are nonuniversal .",
    "the anomalous properties are all connected with dynamics : normally , @xmath96 and @xmath34 decay exponentially , with the diverging lifetime serving to define the exponent @xmath2 through @xmath149 . here",
    "no such definition is possible .",
    "consistent with this , the spreading exponents @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , which are formally zero , are connected to @xmath2 via the scaling relations eqs .",

    "since @xmath42 and @xmath1 are in fact finite , eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) suggest that @xmath2 is infinite .",
    "given janssen s recent results @xcite , it is of interest to know whether our finding of power - law static behavior , but anomalous time - dependence , is compatible with a field - theoretical analysis .",
    "some insight into the violation of dynamic scaling may be gained by returning to eq .",
    "( [ tausc ] ) : the exponential dependence of the lifetime ( in the pure cp ) upon @xmath54 and @xmath122 suggests an extreme sensitivity of dynamic behavior to disorder .",
    "we might expect dynamics to be dominated by the extremes of local fluctuations in the disorder .",
    "the result is that a property such as the relaxation time @xmath92 for the density - density autocorrelation function is _ non - self - averaging _ , i.e. , it does not converge to a limiting value even as @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "another manifestation of non - self - averaging is the dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath40 , even at long times , on the location of the seed at time zero .",
    "these features are dominated by local fluctuations , rather than by the properties of a ",
    "typical \" disorder configuration .",
    "this in turn suggests that further insight may be gained by studying critical behavior for _ fixed _ disorder configurations , in order to determine the statistical distributions of various system properties , and of the domains defined in sec .",
