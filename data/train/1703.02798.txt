    "the emergence of rfid technology in the last decade is the first sign of a serious interest for far - field wireless power transfer ( wpt ) and backscatter communications .",
    "rfid tags harvest energy from the transmit rf signal and rely on backscattering modulation to reflect and modulate the incoming rf signal for communication with an rfid reader . since tags do not require oscillators to generate carrier signals , backscatter communications benefit from orders - of - magnitude lower power consumption than conventional radio communications @xcite .",
    "backscatter communication has recently received a renewed interest , in the context of the internet - of - things , with advances in backscatter communication theory and the development of sophisticated backscatter communication systems @xcite .",
    "backscatter communications commonly assume that the rf transmitter generates a sinusoidal continuous wave ( cw ) .",
    "significant progress has recently been made on the design of efficient signals for wpt @xcite .",
    "in particular , multisine waveforms adaptive to the channel state information ( csi ) have been shown particularly powerful in exploiting the rectifier nonlinearity and the frequency - selectivity of the channel so as to maximize the amount of harvested dc power @xcite .    in this paper , we depart from this traditional cw transmission and leverage those recent progress in wpt signal design , and in particular the adaptive multisine wireless power waveform design , to show that wirelessly powered backscatter communications is subject to a fundamental tradeoff between the harvested energy at the tag and the snr at the reader . indeed , the snr at the reader is a function of the backscatter channel ( concatenation of the forward channel from transmitter to tag and backward channel from tag to reader ) while the harvested energy at the tag is a function of the forward channel only .",
    "due to the difference between those two channels , the optimal transmit waveform design for snr and energy maximization are different .",
    "this suggests that adjusting the transmit waveform leads to a snr - energy tradeoff .    specifically , assuming that the csi is perfectly available to the rf transmitter , we derive a systematic and optimal design of the transmit multisine waveform in order to enlarge as much as possible the snr - energy region . due to the non - linearity of the rectifier , the waveform design and the characterization of the region results from a non - convex posynomial maximization problem that can be solved iteratively using a successive convex approximation approach .",
    "simulation results highlight that increasing the number of sinewaves in the transmit multisine waveform enlarges the snr - energy region by exploiting the non - linearity of the rectifier and a frequency diversity gain .",

    "consider a multisine signal ( with @xmath3 sinewaves ) transmitted by an rf transmitter at time @xmath4 over a single antenna @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to the amplitude and phase of the @xmath9 sinewave at frequency @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the frequencies are evenly spaced , i.e.  @xmath11 with @xmath12 the frequency spacing .",
    "the magnitudes and phases of the sinewaves can be collected into vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath9 entry of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are written as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the transmitter is subject to a transmit power constraint @xmath15 .",
    "the transmit waveform propagates through a multipath channel and is received at the single - antenna tag as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the forward channel frequency response at frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath18 and the phase @xmath19 are such that @xmath20 .",
    "we assume the tag only performs binary modulation .",
    "binary 0 corresponds to a perfect impedance matching that completely absorbs the incoming signal ( i.e. the reflection coefficient is 0 ) .",
    "the signal absorbed by the tag during binary 0 operation is conveyed to a rectifier that converts the incoming rf signal into dc current .",
    "binary 1 corresponds to a perfect impedance mismatch that competely reflects the incoming signal ( i.e. the reflection coefficient is 1 ) .",
    "the signal reflected during binary 1 operation is backscattered to a reader , whose objective is to decide upon the sequence of transmitted bits ( 0 or 1 ) .",
    "we will assume the same rectenna model as in @xcite .",
    "the rectenna is made of an antenna and a rectifier .",
    "the antenna model reflects the power transfer from the antenna to the rectifier through the matching network .",
    "a lossless antenna can be modelled as a voltage source @xmath21 followed by a series resistance @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the input impedance of the rectifier with the matching network .",

    "the snr after maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) is finally given by @xmath55      we assume perfect csit , i.e.  the forward @xmath56 and backscatter @xmath57 channels are perfectly known @xmath58 to the rf transmitter , so as to shape the transmit waveform dynamically as a function of the channel states to maximize @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the backscatter channel @xmath57 can be obtained at the rf transmitter by letting the reader send pilots , reaching the rf transmitter through backscattering .",
    "backscatter and forward channels can then be estimated and obtained at the rf transmitter @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the concatenated channel @xmath61 is perfectly known to the reader to perform mrc .",
    "subject to a transmit power constraint @xmath62 and under the assumption of perfect csit , the maximization of the snr suggests an adaptive single - sinewave strategy ( ass ) that consists in transmitting all power on a single sinewave , namely the one corresponding to the strongest channel @xmath63 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximization of the harvested energy , namely @xmath59 , is shown in @xcite to be equivalent to maximizing the quantity @xmath64 where @xmath65 , @xmath66 , a diode ideality factor @xmath67 and @xmath68 , typical values are given by @xmath69 and @xmath70 . ] .",
    "the maximization of suggests allocating power over multiple sinewaves , and those with stronger frequency - domain channel gains are allocated more power , in order to exploit the non - linearity of the rectifier and the frequency diversity @xcite .",
    "hence the design of efficient waveforms for backscatter communication is subject to a tradeoff between maximizing received snr at the reader and maximizing harvested energy at the tag . characterizing this snr - energy tradeoff and",

    "we formulate the optimization problem as an energy maximization problem subject to transmit power and snr constraints @xmath89 it therefore consists in maximizing a posynomial subject to constraints .",

    "trade - off with b=1mhz and b=10mhz . ]    for the channel frequency responses of fig [ fig_sim_1 ] , algorithm [ algthm_opt_back ] is used , along with cvx @xcite , to compute the optimal waveform and the corresponding snr-@xmath127 tradeoff , illustrated in fig [ fig_sim_2 ] for b=1mhz and b=10mhz . the extreme point on the x - axis ( snr maximization )",
    "is achieved using the ass strategy . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum energy is in general achieved by allocating transmit power over multiple subcarriers ( as a consequence of the non - linearity of the rectifier ) @xcite .",
    "a _ first _ observation from fig [ fig_sim_2 ] is that snr and @xmath127 are indeed subject to a fundamental tradeoff , i.e.  increasing one of them is likely to result in a decrease of the other one .",
    "nevertheless , as the channel becomes more frequency flat or the bandwidth decreases , the snr-@xmath127 appears more rectangular .",
    "second _ observation is that an increase in the number of frequency components @xmath3 of the multisine waveform results in an enlarged snr - energy region . indeed , by increasing @xmath3 , the waveform exploits the nonlinearity of the rectifier and a frequency diversity gain , the latter being beneficial to both snr and energy .",
    "third _ observation is that the shape of the snr - energy region highly depends on the channel realizations and bandwidth . in particular , for the specific channel realization of fig [ fig_sim_1 ] , we note that the 1mhz bandwidth favours higher @xmath127 while the 10 mhz bandwidth favours higher snr .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "recall first that @xmath127 is a function of the forward channel amplitudes @xmath128 @xmath58 , while the snr is a function of the backscatter channel @xmath129 . from fig [ fig_sim_1 ]",
    ", @xmath128 reaches its peak for frequencies between -1 mhz and 0.5 mhz .",
    "since the multisine waveform with a power allocation over multiple frequency components helps increasing @xmath127 , allocating the @xmath3 frequencies uniformly within the 1mhz bandwidth leads to higher @xmath127 than that obtained with a 10mhz bandwidth ( which exhibits deep fades ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath129 exhibits its largest gain around 2mhz , which is outside the 1mhz bandwidth .",
    "since ass maximizes the snr , larger snrs are obtained on the 10mhz channel .",
    "the paper derived a methodology to design adaptive transmit multisine waveforms for backscatter communications and characterize the fundamental tradeoff between conveying energy to the tag and enhancing the snr of the backscatter communication link .",
    "future interesting works consist in addressing the design of waveforms and the characterization of the snr - energy region for more general setup including multiple antennas , multiple transmitters and multiple tags .",
    "the problem of csi acquisition and its impact on the snr - energy region is also of significant interest .",
