    "@xcite we have shown that a sampling with the gaussian function of the kind @xmath8 leads to the trigonometric approximations for the forward @xmath9 and inverse fourier transforms @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the step between two adjacent sampling points and @xmath12 is the fitting parameter , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "the presence of the damping functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the equations above excludes periodicity of the approximated functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , a solitary wavelet ( or non - periodic pulse ) can be effectively approximated in the fourier transform .",
    "however , when we take @xmath30 , the right side of these equations become periodic with corresponding periods @xmath31 , @xmath32 and represent the fourier - type expansion series as follows @xmath33 and @xmath34 it should be noted that if the integral is not analytically integrable , then the function @xmath28 can be approximated by substituting equation into . this substitution yields @xmath35 }",

    "due to representation of the complex error function as a rational approximation , it is rapid in computation .",
    "furthermore , with only 17 summation terms the obtained rational approximation of the complex error function provides accuracy @xmath1 over the most domain of practical importance @xmath36 required for applications utilizing the hitran molecular spectroscopic database @xcite .",
    "the complex error function , also known as the faddeeva function or the kramp function , can be defined as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the complex argument .",
    "the complex error function is a solution of the differential equation @xcite @xmath39 with initial condition @xmath40    the complex error function is closely related to a family of the special functions . among them",

    "mathematically , the voigt function represents a convolution integral of the gaussian and lorentzian distributions @xcite @xmath49 where the principal value integral also implies that it has no discontinuity at @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "we have shown a new technique to obtain a rational approximation for the integrals of kind @xcite @xmath57 we apply this approach together with the fourier transform methodology discussed above in the introduction .",
    "we can use either of equation or .",
    "for example , we may choose the equation corresponding to the inverse fourier transform .",
    "consider the function @xmath58 .",
    "let us find first its forward fourier transform by substituting @xmath58 into equation .",
    "these leads to @xmath59 now substituting @xmath60 into equation yields the following approximation for the exponential function @xmath61 or @xmath62 taking into account that @xmath63 and @xmath64 the approximation can be simplified as given by @xmath65 , \\qquad - \\frac{1}{{2{h_i } } } \\le t \\le \\frac{1}{{2{h_i}}}.\\ ] ]    the right side limitation @xmath66 along the positive @xmath67-axis in equation can be readily excluded by multiplying both its sides to @xmath68 if a constant @xmath69 is positive and sufficiently large .",
    "this can be explained by considering fig .",
    "1 that shows two functions computed according to right side of equation at @xmath70 ( blue curve ) and @xmath71 ( red curve ) . for example , at @xmath70 we can observe two additional peaks at @xmath32 and @xmath72 ( blue curve ) . however , as @xmath69 increases the additional peaks are suppressed stronger to zero due to multiplication to the damping exponential function @xmath68 . as a result , at @xmath71 only a single additional peak at @xmath32 remains visible ( red curve ) .",
    "by @xmath73 all additional peaks completely vanish and , therefore , do not contribute to error in integration .",
    "consequently , if the constant @xmath69 is large enough , say approximately equal or greater than @xmath74 , we can write the approximation @xmath75{e^ { - \\sigma t } } , \\qquad \\sigma   \\mathbin{\\lower.3ex\\hbox{$\\buildrel>\\over { \\smash{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\vphantom{_x}}$ } } 1,\\ ] ] that remains always valid without any limitation along the positive @xmath67-axis . assuming @xmath76 we , therefore ,",
    "can write now @xmath77{e^ { - \\left ( { y + \\sigma } \\right)t } } , \\qquad \\sigma   \\mathbin{\\lower.3ex\\hbox{$\\buildrel>\\over { \\smash{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\vphantom{_x}}$ } } 1.\\ ] ]        since @xmath78 from approximation we obtain @xmath79{e^ { - \\left ( { y + \\sigma } \\right)t } } , \\quad \\sigma   \\mathbin{\\lower.3ex\\hbox{$\\buildrel>\\over { \\smash{\\scriptstyle\\sim}\\vphantom{_x}}$ } } 1.\\ ] ] once again , due to presence of the rapidly damping exponential multiplier @xmath80 this approximation is valid without any limitation along the positive @xmath67-axis . as the peak of the function @xmath81",
    "is shifted towards right with respect to the origin , we may regard to the value @xmath69 as the shift constant .",
    "finally , substituting approximation into integral yields @xmath82 where @xmath83 @xmath84 and @xmath85 as the expansion coefficients @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are independent of the argument @xmath89 , the obtained equation is a rational approximation .    in algorithmic implementation",
    "it is more convenient to use @xmath90-function defined as @xmath91      due to a remarkable identity of the complex error function @xcite @xmath92 it is sufficient to consider only i and ii quadrants in order to cover the entire complex plane .",
    "this can be seen explicitly by representation of the identity in form @xmath93 thus , if the parameter @xmath5 is negative we can simply take it by absolute value and then compute the complex error function according to right side of this equation .",
    "therefore , further we will always assume that @xmath76 .",
    "when the argument @xmath89 is large enough by absolute value , say @xmath94 , we can truncate the laplace continued fraction @xcite @xmath95 approximation based on the laplace continued fraction is rapid in computation .",
    "however , its accuracy deteriorates as the argument @xmath89 decreases by absolute value .",
    "there are different approximations for computation of the narrow - band domain @xmath96 and @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "we can apply , for example , an approximation proposed in our recent work @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath99 $ ] and @xmath100 can be taken equal to @xmath101 .",
    "it has been shown that this approximation can provide accuracy better than @xmath102 over the narrow - band domain @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the domain @xmath103 is the most difficult for computation .",
    "nevertheless , with only @xmath0 summation terms ( at @xmath104 ) the proposed rational approximation covers this domain providing high - accuracy and rapid computation . in computational procedure",
    "we have to choose properly the margin value @xmath105 for the exponential function @xmath106 that appears from the forward fourier transform @xmath107 . as it has been justified by melone _",
    "@xcite , the margin value for integration involving the exponential function @xmath108 can be taken as @xmath109 .",
    "we can use this result in order to determine the required value by solving the following equation with respect to the variable @xmath110 as follows @xmath111 there are two solutions for this equation @xmath112 .",
    "consequently , the margin value for the exponential function @xmath106 can be taken as @xmath113 . as",
    "a parameter @xmath24 is the step between two adjacent sampling points along positive @xmath110-axis ( see @xcite for details ) , its value can be calculated as @xmath114 .",
    "taking @xmath104 we can find that @xmath115 .    in order to quantify the accuracy of the rational approximation",
    "we may define the relative errors @xmath116 - { \\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } \\left [ { w\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right]}}{{{\\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right|\\ ] ] and @xmath117 - { \\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\left [ { w\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right]}}{{{\\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the reference , for the real and imaginary parts , respectively . the highly accurate reference values can be generated by using , for example , algorithm 680 @xcite , recently published algorithm 916 @xcite or c++ code from the roofit package , cerns library @xcite .    figure 2 shows @xmath119 for the real part of the complex error function computed over the domain @xmath96 and @xmath120 at @xmath104 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 . as we can see from this figure , the rational approximation provides accuracy @xmath1 ( blue color ) over the most of this domain .",
    "although accuracy deteriorates with decreasing @xmath5 , it remains better than @xmath102 ( red color ) in the range @xmath123 .",
    "this indicates that at the same @xmath104 the accuracy of the rational approximation is by several orders of the magnitude higher than the accuracy of the weidemans rational approximation ( see equation 38(i ) in @xcite ) .",
    "figure 3 illustrates @xmath124 for the imaginary part of the complex error function also computed over the domain @xmath96 and @xmath120 at @xmath104 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "one can see that in the imaginary part the accuracy is also highly accurate @xmath1 ( blue color ) over the most domain .",
    "there is only a small area @xmath125 and @xmath126 near the origin where the accuracy deteriorates as the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 both tend to zero .",
    "nevertheless , the accuracy in this area still remains high and better than @xmath102 ( red color ) .",
    "the computational test reveals that with only @xmath0 summation terms ( at @xmath104 ) the rational approximation alone can cover the entire hitran domain @xmath36 providing average accuracy @xmath1 for an input array consisting of @xmath127 elements .",
    "algorithmic implementation of the rational approximation results to the same computational speed as that of described in our recent work where we proposed a sampling by incomplete cosine expansion of the sinc function to approximate the complex error function @xcite .",
    "a matlab subroutine code that covers the hitran domain with high - accuracy is presented in appendix a.",
    "we present a new efficient rational approximation to the complex error function by application of the fourier transform that provides computationally rapid and highly accurate results .",
    "the computational test we performed with only @xmath0 summation terms shows that the accuracy of the rational approximation of the complex error function is @xmath1 over the most domain of practical importance .",
    "in particular , the proposed rational approximation of the complex error function alone can cover with high accuracy the entire domain @xmath36 required for the hitran - based spectroscopic applications .",
