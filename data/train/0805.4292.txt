    "the effort to build neutrino mass models at the tev scale has recently revived @xcite , simply because this new energy frontier will soon be explored by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "a naive but reasonable argument is that possible new physics , if it exists at the tev scale and is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking , might also be responsible for the origin of neutrino masses . the latter is a kind of new physics which has been conceivably established by a number of neutrino oscillation experiments in the past decade @xcite .    among many possibilities of generating tiny neutrino masses",
    ", a natural one is to extend the standard model by introducing a few heavy right - handed majorana neutrinos @xcite and ( or ) one higgs triplet @xcite .",
    "the gauge - invariant neutrino mass terms can then be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass matrix of right - handed majorana neutrinos , and @xmath13 denotes the higgs triplet .",
    "after the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , one obtains the neutrino mass matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond to the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of @xmath18 and @xmath1 . to minimize the degrees of freedom associated with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath12 , we may assume that there is only a single heavy majorana neutrino ( denoted as @xmath2 ) in the model .",
    "this assumption implies that @xmath12 and @xmath21 become @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , but @xmath19 remains to be @xmath24 .",
    "such a simple seesaw scenario is phenomenologically viable and can be referred to as the minimal type - ii seesaw model @xcite .",
    "its simplicity makes it interesting and instructive to reveal the salient features of the type - ii seesaw mechanism .",
    "therefore , we shall concentrate on this model in the present paper .",
    "our purpose is to investigate the dileptonic decays of doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath0 in the minimal type - ii seesaw model .",
    "such decays can naturally happen because @xmath1 is allowed to couple to the standard - model higgs doublet @xmath18 and thus the lepton number is violated by two units @xcite .",
    "if the mass scale of @xmath1 is of @xmath25 tev , then @xmath0 can be produced at the lhc via the drell - yan process @xmath26 or through the charged - current process @xmath27 .",
    "note that the masses of @xmath0 and @xmath28 are expected to be nearly degenerate in a class of seesaw models @xcite , so only @xmath29 ( for @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 modes are kinematically open .",
    "note also that the dileptonic channels @xmath29 become dominant when @xmath32 mev is taken @xcite . therefore , we focus our interest on the same - sign dilepton events of @xmath0 , which signify the lepton number violation and serve for a clean collider signature of new physics beyond the standard model @xcite",
    ". the rates of @xmath33 decays are given by @xmath34 from which one obtains the branching ratios @xcite @xmath35 where the greek subscripts run over @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it becomes obvious that the magnitudes of @xmath39 are only relevant to the matrix elements of @xmath19 .",
    "we find that the branching ratios @xmath40 depend not only on the masses ( @xmath41 ) , flavor mixing angles ( @xmath42 ) and cp - violating phases ( @xmath43 ) of three light neutrinos @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , but also on the mass ( @xmath47 ) and mixing parameters ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) of the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath2 . when the former contribution is negligibly small , we can reproduce the case discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; but when the contribution of @xmath2 is negligibly small , our results for @xmath50 can simply reproduce those obtained in the triplet seesaw model @xcite .",
    "the new and most interesting case , which has not been analyzed before , is the competition or interference between the contributions of light and heavy majorana neutrinos . typically assuming @xmath511 tev and taking three possible mass patterns of @xmath4",
    "as allowed by current neutrino oscillation data , we figure out the generous interference bands of @xmath4 and @xmath2 contributions to @xmath52 : @xmath7@xmath8 ( for @xmath53 ) .",
    "we stress that both constructive and destructive interference effects are possible in this parameter region , in which it is very difficult to distinguish the type - ii seesaw model from the triplet seesaw model at the lhc .",
    "we present some detailed numerical calculations of @xmath50 in the interference bands .",
    "although our numerical results are subject to the minimal type - ii seesaw model , they can serve as a good example to illustrate the interplay between light and heavy majorana neutrinos in a generic type - ii seesaw scenario .",
    "after the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , we rewrite eq . ( 1 ) as @xmath54 we assume the existence of only a single heavy majorana neutrino @xmath2 in the type - ii seesaw scenario .",
    "the @xmath55 neutrino mass matrix in eq . ( 5 ) is symmetric and can be diagonalized by the following unitary transformation : @xmath56 where @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the masses of three light neutrinos @xmath4 , and @xmath47 denotes the mass of @xmath2 . after this diagonalization , the flavor states of three light neutrinos @xmath59 ( for @xmath60 )",
    "can be expressed in terms of the masses states of both three light majorana neutrinos @xmath4 ( for @xmath61 ) and the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath2 ; namely , @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are responsible for neutrino oscillations of @xmath4 and collider signatures of @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath65 itself is not unitary , because @xmath67 holds as a consequence of unitarity of the @xmath55 transformation matrix in eq .",
    "the correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be parametrized as @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( for @xmath74 ) being the rotation angles and phase angles , respectively .",
    "if the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath2 is decoupled ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) , @xmath65 will become a unitary matrix and take the standard form as advocated in refs .",

    "<S> the dileptonic decays of doubly - charged higgs bosons @xmath0 are investigated in the minimal type - ii seesaw model with one higgs triplet @xmath1 and one heavy majorana neutrino @xmath2 at the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the branching ratios @xmath3 depend not only on the mass and mixing parameters of three light neutrinos @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 ) , but also on those of @xmath2 . assuming the mass of @xmath2 to lie in the range 200 gev1 tev , we figure out the generous interference bands for the contributions of @xmath4 and @xmath2 to @xmath6 : @xmath7@xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 measure the strength of charged - current interactions of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate some salient features of the interference bands by considering three typical mass patterns of @xmath4 , and stress that it is very difficult to distinguish the type - ii seesaw model from the triplet seesaw model in such a parameter region at the large hadron collider . </S>"
