    "this approach has been extended to the production of pion pairs @xcite since the @xmath6-state does not have any definite charge parity and therefore both pomeron and odderon exchanges may contribute to the production amplitude .    in this paper , we study within perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) the charge asymmetries in the production of two pion pairs in photon - photon collisions @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the initial photon polarization vectors , see fig .",

    "we have in mind the ultraperipheral collisions of protons or nuclei of high energies , which constitute a promising new way to study qcd processes initiated by two quasi real photons @xcite . at high energy the application of pqcd for the calculation of a part of this process is justified by the presence of a hard scale : the momentum transfer @xmath10 from an initial photon to a final pion pair , @xmath11 being of the order of a few gev@xmath12 .",

    "although we do not neglect this contribution , it is clear that the asymmetry described in the following section is driven by the odderon/ pomeron - interference .",
    "in the following we make use of the fact that the gdas for @xmath89-even and for @xmath89-odd pion pairs are orthogonal to each other in the space of legendre polynomials in @xmath92 . as a consequence , in the total cross section the interference term completely vanishes .",

    "therefore , we consider that process as background .",
    "this circumstance would make heavy ions preferable because of the different scaling of pomeron and photon coupling when changing from proton to nuclei scattering .",

    "indeed , the @xmath2 events dominates , due to the photon propagator singularities , when each of the transverse momentum is small , which on the average is satisfied when the _ total _ transverse momentum is imposed to be small .",

    "the study of these effects goes beyond the goal of this paper .",
    "since we demonstrated that the rate and asymmetry were sizable for moderate values of the @xmath0 energy , we do not expect evolution effects to play a major role in the proposed strategy to uncover odderon effects .",

    "we have calculated both contributions in a perturbative approach  justified by @xmath40 providing the hard scale  where the only soft building blocks needed are the gdas of the pion pairs .",
    "we have shown that a charge asymmetry in the polar angle @xmath35 ( defined in the rest frame of the pion pairs ) is linearly dependent on the odderon amplitude and moreover is sizable but gda - model dependent .",
    "in fact , the predicted asymmetry depends much of the two pion gdas , which are still not really known although hermes measurements of two pion electroproduction @xcite disfavor models with a strong @xmath85 coupling to the @xmath139 state .",
    "we however think that higher statistics data , which may come from a jlab experiment at 6 or 12gev , are definitely needed before one can trust a definite model of the gdas . because two pion deep electroproduction in the low energy domain is dominated by quark exchanges , this test of the gda models is independent of any odderon search .",
    "this looks like a prerequisite to a trustable extraction of the odderon signal  or of an upper bound on odderon exchange amplitudes  from ultraperipheral collisions .",
    "we have discussed the possibility to measure this process in ultraperipheral collisions at lhc .",
