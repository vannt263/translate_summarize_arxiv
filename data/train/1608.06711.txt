    "have been measured with reasonably good accuracy @xcite .",
    "the investigation of moderately large value of smallest leptonic mixing angle @xmath4 in the investigation of lepton mixing matrix @xcite , @xcite , @xcite by the daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite reactor neutrino experiments has rejuvenated the opportunities to investigate unknowns in the neutrino physics .",
    "this great discovery enhances the possible capability of the next - generation experiments to pin down the neutrino mass hierarchy ( i.e. , the sign of @xmath11 ) and eventually to determine the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath12 .",
    "global fit of neutrino oscillations with data from world class experiments @xcite , @xcite put stringent bounds on the neutrino oscillation parameters . in the present work we shall discuss about the possible measurement of cp - violating phase ` @xmath0 ' , in the context of recently proposed laguna - lbno@xcite and lbne@xcite experiments .",
    "long base line ( lbl ) neutrino experiments like lbno , lbne etc . due to",
    "their long base lines have advantage over the short base line experiments , latter can be approximated to vacuum oscillation neutrino experiments . in vacuum",
    ", cp - violation depends only on @xmath0 phase , hence vacuum oscillation cp - violation amplitudes give pure or intrinsic measurement of @xmath0 . due to very small values of cp - violating effects at these short base lines",
    ", it is very difficult to carry out their experimental analysis . over long distances contamination of terrestrial matter effects",
    "becomes large , which in turn increases oscillation amplitude and fake the @xmath0 phase effects . in lbl experiments",
    "pure cp - violation effects arising due to @xmath0 phase only get mixed with cp - violation matter effects arising due to asymmetric forward scattering of neutrino s and anti - neutrino s with matter constituents , also known as fake or extrinsic cp - violation effects . in case of matter oscillation phenomenology , cp conjugate of particle oscillation probability",
    "can be obtained by merely changing the sign of @xmath0 phase and matter potential ` a ' ( as can be seen in equations ( [ seri ] ) and ( [ antseri ] ) below ) . due to these changes ,",
    "matter effects in the case of normal mass hierarchy produce overall enhancement in the vacuum effects , which makes transition probability amplitude so large at moderate base line lengths that , we expect them to measure experimentally .",
    "but now if we shift from the normal mass hierarchy ( nh i.e. @xmath13 ) to the inverted mass hierarchy ( ih i.e. @xmath14 ) , the mass hierarchy parameter @xmath15 in equation ( [ seri ] ) also changes sign , due to which a part of matter effects get reduced , which in turn lowers the value of probability amplitude .",
    "this addition in the nh - case and subtraction in the ih - case at given base line length ` l ' and beam energy ` e ' , separates the nh and ih probability amplitudes to the amount that we can differentiate among them experimentally .    in lbl experiments , the experimental configurations :",
    "lbne(@xmath16 ) and lbno(@xmath17 ) @xcite are so chosen , that the asymmetry between @xmath18 and @xmath19 oscillation probabilities is larger than the cp violation effects produced by @xmath0 phase , which makes these suitable for determining the mass hierarchy as well as @xmath0 phase @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed neutrino oscillation experiment viz .",
    "dune @xcite , @xcite , @xcite with base line nearly equal to lbne , holds similar discussion and conclusions to that of lbne .",
    "thus while studying lbne , we are also studying oscillation phenomenology of the dune experiment simultaneously .",
    "the sub - dominant platinum channel ( @xmath20 ) , because of its sensitivity to still unknown neutrino oscillation parameters ( e.g. mass ordering , @xmath0 phase , octant of @xmath5 etc ) and ability to analyze experimental data logically , has the advantage over other appearance and disappearance oscillation channels .",

    "all these analytic formalisms make use of the method of perturbation theory expansion of neutrino evolution @xmath22-matrix . in the present work ,",

    "[ fig : dcpni ]    this cp - violation probability , @xmath0 phase sensitivity parameter @xmath2 ( for @xmath55 ) in case of both the nh and ih cases , is illustrated as a function of beam energy @xmath36 in fig .",

    "we observe that in both the nh and ih cases , for lbne we expect an average sensitivity of @xmath58 at @xmath59 and for lbno there is a sensitivity of @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "there are other oscillation maximas , for example , at @xmath62 gev with sensitivity of @xmath63 for lbne in both the nh and ih cases . while for the lbno experiment at e=1.3 gev we expect a sensitivity of @xmath64 for nh - case and sensitivity of @xmath65 for ih - case . also , there are other oscillation maximas with sensitivity of @xmath66 % for the nh - case and @xmath67 % for ih - case at 0.8 , 0.6 gev respectively . but due to fast oscillations around these maximas , almost mono - energetic beam energy could only make the experimental realization possible .",
    "energy spreads in the currently available beam sources are relatively broad , due to which we do nt prefer to discuss about these oscillation maximas in detail .",
    "the other thing we notice in these figures is that , in the specific beam energy range , parameter @xmath2 attains positive values for one hierarchy and negative for the other hierarchy .",
    "for example , in the case of lbno experiment , in the beam energy range of @xmath68 , parameter @xmath2 assumes positive values in the nh - case , while negative values in the ih - case over the whole @xmath0 ( @xmath69 ) possible range .",
    "these positive and negative values of the parameter @xmath2 can be confirmed experimentally .",

    "[ fig : dcpcnt ] , an oscillogram for the parameter @xmath70 in the @xmath71 plane has been shown .",

    "we expect a sensitivity of @xmath74 , while at higher end of @xmath75 for both hierarchies . in the lbno experiment , in the nh - case , at central red dot @xmath76 and",

    ", parameter @xmath70 has value @xmath72 at central red dot and has values of @xmath78 & @xmath79 at lower & higher ends of energy spectrum respectively .",
    "thus for lbno , normal hierarchy has more sensitivity as compared to inverted hierarchy and the sensitivity further increases at lower end of energy spectrum .",
    "it suggests that lower energy spectrum ends are more suitable than higher ones to investigate @xmath0 phase .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : prasens ] , that parameter @xmath70 is feebly sensitive towards the variations in mixing parameters in the chosen range , for both lbne and lbno experiments . from the numerical analysis",

    "[ fig : prasens12 ] , sensitivity of the parameters @xmath70 and @xmath1 towards the variations in mixing parameters for experimental configuration ( @xmath81 ) has been illustrated .",
    "we can analyze from the figure , that both parameters have small sensitivity towards mixing angles @xmath3 & @xmath5 variations .",
    "parameter @xmath70 has noticeable sensitivity towards the @xmath4 variations , while @xmath1 has small sensitivity . also , the parameter @xmath70 has noticeable sensitivity to the @xmath82 variations , while parameter @xmath1 has small sensitivity .",
    "we can easily notice that @xmath70 has large sensitivity towards the @xmath83 variations , while @xmath1 has moderate sensitivity on that parameter .",
    "we can conclude that , if we know @xmath4 very precisely , then parameter @xmath70 is left sensitive to the mass square differences .",
    "it is evident from the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : prasens23 ] that , parameter @xmath70 attains moderate sensitivity towards the @xmath3 and @xmath5 variations , while @xmath1 has small sensitivity towards these variations .",
    "also parameter @xmath70 has large sensitivity to the @xmath4 variations , while parameter @xmath1 has moderate sensitivity .",
    "similarly @xmath70 has noticeable sensitivity towards the @xmath82 variations , while @xmath1 has moderate sensitivity .",
    "it is evident from figure , that both parameters @xmath70 and @xmath1 attain large sensitivity towards the variations in the atmospheric mass square difference ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "thus if we know the precise value of reactor mixing angle @xmath4 then , we are left with large sensitivities of the parameters toward the variations in solar and atmospheric mass square differences only .",

    "we can also conclude that for given parameter , sensitivity in the nh - case is always almost equal to sensitivity in ih - case .",
    "it is also clear from the analysis of all the three figs .",
    "( i.e. [ fig : prasens ] , [ fig : prasens12 ] , [ fig : prasens23 ] ) , that the sensitivity of parameters increase with the increase in baseline length ` @xmath35 ' and lowering in the beam energy ` @xmath36 ' .",
    "if we compare parameters @xmath70 and @xmath1 , then former shows large sensitivity in comparison to latter .",
    "in this work we have studied two parameters viz .",
    "the `` transition probability , @xmath0 phase sensitivity parameter , @xmath1 '' and the `` cp - violation probability , @xmath0 phase sensitivity parameter , @xmath2 '' especially to investigate dirac s @xmath0 phase .",
    "we can conclude from the analysis of figs .",
    "[ fig : optmz ] , [ fig : prcnt ] , [ fig : dcpni ] and [ fig : dcpcnt ] , that lbno provides better sensitivity as compared to lbne towards the @xmath0 phase variations .",
    "we also notice that for a given baseline , this sensitivity is more in the nh - case than in the ih - case , for the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this sensitivity further increases at lower end of energy spectrum .",
    "parameter @xmath2 enables to clearly differentiate among the two mass hierarchies from the positive and negative values of this parameter for either of hierarchy , in the specific beam energy range , as is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : dcpni ] .",
    "this latter distinction of two hierarchies by the sign of @xmath2 is more pronounced in case of lbno experiment .",
    "we also notice from the comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig : prcnt ] and [ fig : dcpcnt ] , that for given base line length ( @xmath35 ) and beam energy ( @xmath36 ) sensitivity towards the @xmath0 phase variations is larger for the parameter @xmath70 in comparison to parameter @xmath1 .",
    "though it is not convenient to investigate higher oscillation maximas ( i.e. , second and third order ) , due to large spreads in the energy spectrum of beam sources and comparatively less resolutions of the present detectors .",
    "but , sufficiently large values of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath70 at these maximas encourage to investigate these experimentally , to put more stringent bounds on the @xmath0 phase .",
    "investigation of these higher oscillation maximas need more accurate detection techniques and almost narrow energy spectra .    at relatively small value of beam energy ,",
    "` @xmath36 ' ( @xmath84 ) , sensitivity of the parameter @xmath70 is large towards the atmospheric mass square difference ( @xmath83 ) variations in case of both lbne and lbno experiments . while , this parameter has moderate sensitivity towards the solar mass square difference ( @xmath82 ) variations , in the lbne experiment case and has large sensitivity in the case of lbno .",
    "parameter @xmath1 has moderate sensitivity towards the @xmath83 variations and has small sensitivity to the @xmath82 variations in case of lbne , while this parameter has large sensitivity to @xmath83 variations and has moderate sensitivity to the @xmath82 variations in the case of lbno experiment",
    ". also parameter @xmath70 has large sensitivity towards the @xmath4 variations in case of both lbne and lbno experiments , while the parameter @xmath1 has moderate sensitivity . in case of both lbne and lbno experiments sensitivity of both parameters",

    "if we need large / small sensitivities , we can prefer to low / high beam energy regions .",
    "as parameters @xmath2 & @xmath70 are the differences of two cp conjugate channels and parameter @xmath1 is that of single oscillation channel , no doubt errors / uncertainties get canceled to an extent for both parameters , but being a difference involving the same channel such cancellation is large in the case of parameter @xmath1 .",
