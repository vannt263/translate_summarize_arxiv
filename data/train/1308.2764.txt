    "diffusion processes governed by stochastic differential equations ( hereafter sde ) are widely used in describing the phenomenon of random fluctuations over time , and even become indispensable for analyzing high - frequency data ; see , for example , mykland and zhang @xcite .",
    "practical application of diffusion models calls for statistical inference based on discretely monitored data .",
    "the literature has seen a wide spectrum of asymptotically efficient estimation methods , for example , those based on various contrast functions proposed in yoshida  @xcite , kessler  @xcite , kessler and srensen @xcite and the references given in srensen  @xcite .",
    "taking the efficiency , feasibility and generality into account , maximum - likelihood estimation ( hereafter mle ) can be a choice among others .",
    "however , for the increasingly complex real - world dynamics , likelihood functions ( transition densities ) are generally not known in closed - form and thus involve significant challenges in valuation .",
    "this leads to various methods of approximation and the resulting approximate mle .",
    "the focus of this paper is to propose a widely applicable closed - form asymptotic expansion for transition density and thus to apply it in approximate mle for multivariate diffusion process .      to approximate likelihood functions , yoshida @xcite proposed to discretize continuous likelihood functions ( see , e.g. , basawa and prakasa rao  @xcite ) ; many others focused on direct approximation of likelihood functions ( transition densities ) for discretely monitored data , see surveys in , for example , phillips and yu @xcite , jensen and poulsen  @xcite , hurn , jeisman and lindsay  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "in particular , among various numerical methods , lo  @xcite proposed to employ a numerical solution of kolmogorov equation for transition density ; pedersen  @xcite , brandt and santa - clara @xcite , durham and gallant  @xcite , stramer and yan @xcite , beskos and roberts  @xcite , beskos et al .",
    "@xcite , beskos , papaspiliopoulos and roberts  @xcite and elerian , chib and shephard @xcite advocated the application of various monte carlo simulation methods ; yu and phillips  @xcite developed an exact gaussian method for models with a linear drift function ; jensen and poulsen @xcite resorted to the techniques of binomial trees . since all these numerical methods are computationally demanding , real - world implementation has necessitated the development of analytical methods for efficiently approximating transition density .",
    "an adhoc approach is to approximate the model by discretization , for example , the euler scheme , and then use the transition density of the discretized model .",
    "elerian  @xcite refined such an approximation via the second order milstein scheme .",
    "kessler  @xcite and uchida and yoshida  @xcite employed a more sophisticated normal - distribution - based approximation via higher order expansions of the mean and variance .",
    "for approximate mle of diffusions , dacunha - castelle and florens - zmirou  @xcite is one of the earliest attempts to apply the idea of small - time expansion of transition densities , which in principle can be made arbitrarily accurate .",
    "however , their method relies on implicit representation of moments of brownian bridge functionals , and thus requires monte carlo simulation in implementation .",
    "a milestone is the ground - breaking work of at - sahalia  , which established the theory of hermite - polynomial - based analytical expansion for transition density of diffusion models and the corresponding approximate mle . along the line of at - sahalia  @xcite ,",
    "a number of substantial refinements and applications emerged in the literature of likelihood - based statistical inference ( see surveys in at - sahalia  @xcite ) ; see , for example , bakshi and ju  @xcite , bakshi , ju and ou - yang @xcite , at - sahalia and mykland @xcite , at - sahalia and kimmel @xcite , li  @xcite , egorov , li and xu  @xcite , schaumburg @xcite , at - sahalia and yu  @xcite , yu @xcite , filipovi , mayerhofer and schneider  @xcite , tang and chen  @xcite , xiu  @xcite and chang and chen  @xcite",
    ".      starting from the celebrated edgeworth expansion for distribution of standardized summation of independently identically distributed random variables ( see , e.g. , chapter xvi in feller  @xcite , chapter 2 in hall  @xcite and chapter 5 in mccullagh  @xcite ) , asymptotic expansions have become powerful tools for statistics , econometrics and many other disciplines in science and technology .",
    "taking dependence of random variables into account , mykland @xcite established the theory , calculation and various statistical applications of martingale expansion , which is further developed in yoshida @xcite .",
    "having an analogy with these edgeworth - type expansions and motivated by mle for diffusion processes , i propose a new small - time asymptotic expansion of transition density for multivariate diffusions based on the theory of watanabe  @xcite and yoshida  @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to the traditional edgeworth expansions , our expansion does not require the knowledge of generally implicit moments , cumulants or characteristic function of the underlying variable , and thus it is applicable to a wide range of diffusion processes .",
    "moreover , in analogy to the verification of validity given in , for example , bhattacharya and ghosh  @xcite , mykland  @xcite and yoshida @xcite for edgeworth type expansions , the uniform convergence rate ( with respect to various parameters ) of our density expansion is proved under some sufficient conditions on the drift and diffusion coefficients of the underlying diffusion using the theory of watanabe  @xcite and yoshida  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the approximate mle converges to the true one , and thus inherits its asymptotic properties .",
    "such results are further demonstrated through numerical tests and monte carlo simulations for some representative examples .    in comparison to the expansion proposed by at - sahalia @xcite ,",
    "our method is able to bypass the challenge resulting from the discussion of reducibility , the explicity of the _ lamperti _ transform ( see , e.g. , section 5.2 in karatzas and shreve  @xcite ) and its inversion , as well as the iterated equations for expressing correction terms , which in general lead to multidimensional integrals ; see bakshi , ju and ou - yang @xcite .",
    "thus it renders an algorithm for practically obtaining a closed - form expansion ( without integrals and implicit transforms ) for transition density up to any arbitrary order , which serves as a widely applicable tool for approximate mle . even after the _ lamperti _ transform",
    ", our expansion employs a completely different nature comparing with those proposed in at - sahalia @xcite , which hinge on expansions in an orthogonal basis consisting of hermite polynomials and expansions of each coefficient expressed by an expectation of a smooth functional of the transformed variable via an iterated dynkin formula ; see section  4 in at - sahalia  @xcite .",
    "moreover , our method is different from the existing theory of large - deviations - based expansions , which were discussed in , for example , azencott  @xcite , bismut  @xcite , ben arous  @xcite and landre @xcite , and given probabilistic representation in watanabe  @xcite for the purpose of investigating the analytical structure of heat kernel in differential geometry .",
    "large - deviations - based asymptotic expansions involve riemannian distance ( implied by the true but generally unknown transition density ) and higher order correction terms . except for some special cases ,",
    "they rarely admit closed - form expressions by solving the corresponding variational problems . however , for practical implementation of statistical estimation , relatively simple closed - form approximations are usually favorable .",

    "they are sufficient ( but not necessary ) to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the solution and other desirable technical properties . for convenience , the theoretical proofs given in appendix  [ appendixproofs ] are based on these conditions .",
    "however , as is shown in sections [ sectionimplementationexamples ] and  [ sectionamlemc ] , numerical examples suggest that the method proposed in this paper is applicable to a wide range of commonly used models , rather than confined to those strictly satisfying these sufficient ( but not necessary ) conditions .",
    "assumption  [ assumption3timesdifferentiable ] collects two standard conditions for maximum likelihood estimation .",
    "in particular , for the continuity ( and higher differentiability ) of the transition density in the parameter , sufficient conditions based on the smoothness of the drift and dispersion functions can be found in , for example , azencott @xcite and at - sahalia @xcite .",
    "theoretical relaxation of these conditions may involve case - by - case treatment and standard approximation argument , which is beyond the scope of this paper and can be regarded as a future research topic .",
