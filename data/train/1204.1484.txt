    "a hypersurface @xmath0 in an @xmath1-dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath2 is called _ biconservative _ if @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the shape operator , @xmath5 is the mean curvature function and @xmath6 is the tangent component of the ricci curvature of @xmath7 in the direction of the unit normal @xmath8 of @xmath9 in @xmath7 .",
    "the name biconservative , as we shall describe in section  [ sec : stress - energy - tensor ] , comes from the fact that condition is equivalent to the conservativeness of a certain _ stress - energy _",

    "moreover , the class of biconservative submanifolds includes that of biharmonic submanifolds , which have been of large interest in the last decade ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "biharmonic submanifolds are characterized by the vanishing of the bitension field and they represent a generalization of harmonic ( minimal ) submanifolds .",
    "in fact , as detailed in section  [ sec : stress - energy - tensor ] , a submanifold is biconservative if the tangent part of the bitension field vanishes .",
    "it is worth to point out that , thinking at the energy functional instead of the bienergy functional , the notion of _ conservative _ submanifolds is not useful as all submanifolds are conservative ( see remark  [ remark : conservative ] ) .",
    "we also would like to point out that submanifolds with vanishing tangent part of the bitension field have been considered by sasahara in @xcite where he studied certain 3-dimensional submanifolds in @xmath12 .",
    "in this paper we consider biconservative surfaces in a 3-dimensional space form @xmath13 of constant sectional curvature @xmath14 . in this case",
    "becomes @xmath15 from we see that cmc surfaces , i.e. surfaces with constant mean curvature , in space forms are biconservative .",
    "thus our interest will be on non cmc biconservative surfaces .    as a general fact",
    ", we first prove that the mean curvature function @xmath16 of a biconservative surface in a 3-dimensional space form satisfies the following pde @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the gauss curvature of the surface , while @xmath19 is the laplace - beltrami operator on @xmath9 .",
    "then the paper is completely devoted to the local classification of biconservative surfaces in 3-dimensional space forms .",
    "this is done in three sections where we examine , separately , the cases of : surfaces in the 3-dimensional euclidean space ; surfaces in the 3-dimensional sphere ; surfaces in the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space .    for biconservative surfaces in @xmath20",

    "our approach is slightly different and allow us to go further and classify the biconservative surfaces in @xmath27 and in @xmath28 .",
