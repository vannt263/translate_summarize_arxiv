    "interference management task is of prime importance for the cognitive radio network design .    due to dependence of the interference management task on the knowledge of channel gains between secondary transmitters and primary receivers , channel state information ( csi ) plays a critical role in the design and successful implementation of cognitive radio protocols . on the other hand , availability of",
    "_ centralized _ csi at the secondary network relies on the existence of feedback links for conveying csi .",

    "the throughput scaling behavior of cognitive multiple access networks was investigated when interference channel gains are partially available at the secondary network and the distributions of channel gains belong to a fairly large class of distribution functions called class-@xmath3 distribution functions .    in @xcite , the authors obtained capacity expressions for a cognitive broadcast network sharing multiple orthogonal frequency bands with a primary network under peak interference power constraints in each band . in @xcite , a secondary network with @xmath2 secondary transmitter - receiver pairs sharing @xmath4 frequency bands with a primary network was considered . the authors established a double - logarithmic scaling law for the secondary network capacity under the optimum matching of @xmath4 sus with @xmath4 primary network frequency bands .",
