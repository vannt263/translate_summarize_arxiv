    "ranked data commonly arise in many substantive areas such as psychology , social research and marketing research when the interest is focused on the relative ordering of various items , options , stimuli or objects . a typical aim of such studies is to estimate the mean or average ordering of a set of items , and to investigate how this ordering changes with respondent characteristics .",
    "this paper focuses on the analysis of a survey question from a special eurobarometer survey on science knowledge , which asked respondents to rank six sources of science information in order of importance .",
    "eurobarometer public opinion surveys have been carried out in all member states of the european union since 1973 .",
    "eurobarometer 55.2 was a special survey collected in 2001 and designed to elicit information on european experience and perception of science and technology .",
    "17 countries in total were surveyed  with northern ireland , great britain , east germany and west germany being treated as separate countries for the purposes of the survey . within each country a multistage sampling scheme was used .",
    "primary sampling units ( psus ) were randomly selected with probability based on population size after stratification by administrative region and by the degree of urbanization . within each psu ,",
    "a cluster of addresses was sampled , and random route methods were used to select households . finally , a respondent was selected at random from within each household .",
    "face to face interviewing was used to elicit responses .",
    "our question of interest in this paper is given in figure [ aimssw ] .",
    "@l@ * eurobarometer 55.2 may ",
    "june 2001 question 5 .",
    "+ here are some sources of information about scientific developments .",
    "+ please rank them from 1 to 6 in terms of their importance to you + ( 1 being the most important and 6 the least important ) + *    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     it is also possible to proceed by treating the mass point components as latent classes .",
    "table [ classprop ] shows the estimated proportions of patterns @xmath0 ( which are obtained directly from the algorithm ) and the estimated proportions of respondents which are weighted averages of the posterior probabilities of pattern membership in each class ( @xmath1 ) , weighted by the proportion of respondents in each pattern . equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in the online supplement provide further details .",
    "examining the proportions of respondents , we see that class 6 is the largest class with just under 29% of respondents , followed by class 3 with about 25% and class 1 with just over 18% .",
    "figure [ deltaplot ] shows the estimated random effect components @xmath2 for all items and all classes ( apart for the reference item @xmath3 and class @xmath4 which are set to zero ) including 95% confidence intervals based on the corrected estimated standard errors .",
    "the bars @xmath5 are half the log odds ratios comparing the extra effect of item @xmath6 to the reference item @xmath3 ( education ) and for class @xmath7 related to the reference class @xmath4 ( class  6 ) .     and",
    "95% confidence intervals based on corrected standard errors . ]",
    "it can be seen , for example , that for class 1 the odds for tv and radio are substantially lower than for education compared to class 6 [ tv : @xmath8 , radio : @xmath9 . in class 4",
    "the odds for press compared to education are about @xmath10 times higher and for www 2.1 times higher than in class 6 [ press : @xmath11 , www : @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ worthplots ] shows , for males and for females , the plotted worths against age for each of the six sources of information , for two of the six latent classes .",
    "we see that the two classes represent different preference patterns in the data .",
    "class 6 represents a large subpopulation who prefer to obtain most of their scientific information from nontext and nonscholarly sources . for all age groups and for both males and females",
    ", tv is the most preferred source , with radio the second most preferred and increasing in preference with age .",
    "class 1 , in contrast , represents a smaller subpopulation which prefers academic sources of information over more popular information sources . in this class , for all but the youngest age group , scientific magazines and school / university sources rank in the top two places ( with scientific magazines winning out over school / university for males but not for females ) . for the youngest age group ,",
    "the school / university followed by the internet are preferred for both males and females .",
    "class 3 , the second largest group ( not shown ) , shows a latent class which is similar to class 6 but with a different second preference .",
    "tv is still the most preferred source , followed by newspapers and the radio for the three older age groups . for the youngest age group , radio declines in preference and the third preferred source",
    "becomes the internet for males and school / university for females . in terms of the other classes which are not displayed ,",
    "classes 4 and 5 also have tv in first place , but with different orderings of other sources in other places .",
    "class 2 ( 7% ) prefers school / university as the most preferred source of information but with tv in second place .",
    "it is to be expected that relevant variables not included in the model are absorbed in the latent classes .",
    "this relates to variables which are ( i ) known but for various reasons not accounted for ( e.g. , variables with many categories making computation unfeasible or impossible ) and also to ( ii ) possibly unknown sources of variation . in the eurobarometer survey , for example , there is a complex five - level clustering design of households within address clusters within psus within urbanization and administrative region strata and within countries . while some of these variables are present in the data set , others are not .",
    "in addition , each country has used a different coding scheme for determining degree of urbanization .",
    "this means that a full multilevel analysis taking account of all design components is not possible .",
    "however , it could be argued that the most important strata are degree of urbanization and country , and these two levels would account for most variability within the clustered sample .",
    "we therefore examine the effect of these two variables below .    to evaluate the effect of known variables , a post - hoc analysis may be performed by analyzing their association with the respondents class memberships .",
    "two approaches are possible which use different definitions of class membership .",
    "we illustrate using two covariates not in the model but which are used in the sample design  degree of urbanization and country . for degree of urbanization , we adopt a common three - level categorization which is consistent across countries .",
    "we use 15 countries rather than 17 for this investigation , combining east and west germany ( d ) , and great britain and northern ireland ( gb ) .",
    "the remaining countries are labeled by their international licence plate country code .",
    "the first method uses the posterior probabilities of class memberships to construct the expected number of respondents in each class within each category of the covariate of interest [ see equation ( 4 ) in the online supplement ] .",
    "we present two mosaic plots [ @xcite ] which cross - classify the expected class membership with degree of urbanization and with country ( displayed in figure [ mosaic1 ] ) .    in examining the degree of urbanization mosaic plot ,",
    "it can be seen that the proportion of rural residents are underrepresented in class @xmath13 and have a higher proportion in class @xmath14 as opposed to residents of large cities .",
    "the country mosaic plot shows much greater variability .",
    "respondents in italy , for example , are far less likely to belong to latent class @xmath14 and far more likely to belong to latent class @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , respondents in austria and germany are far more likely to belong to class @xmath14 .",
    "one explanation for this variability might be the varying quality of tv across countries in broadcasting science information , coupled with a large number of excellent science magazines in italy .    a second approach , as mentioned in section [ sec:5 ] , assigns the respondents ( who belong to covariate set @xmath15 and have response pattern @xmath16 ) directly to the class with the highest posterior probability @xmath17 . following this procedure ,",
    "we can obtain a response variable with categories according to the classes and investigate the effects of some variables not included in the model via a multinomial regression model .",
    "we then form a cross - classified table of assigned class by country and by degree of urbanization to evaluate possible influences due to part of the multistage sampling design . by fitting a multinomial model",
    ", we found a strong interaction effect between degree of urbanization and country .",
    "this interaction can be visualized by examining observed log - odds ratios in the constructed table .",
    "figure [ logodds1 ] shows the observed log - odds ratios comparing classes @xmath13@xmath14 for the 15 countries both for rural areas and for large cities .",
    "we can notice , for example , that italy has a positive log - odds ratio for both rural areas and large cities , indicating the relative underrepresentation of class 6 is true both for urban and rural locations .",
    "in other countries such as finland , class 6 is more prevalent in rural areas , and class 1 in large cities .",
    "random effects models are often necessary in models for ranked and paired comparison data but the multivariate nature of random effects in these type of models adds complexity .",
    "npml methods of the type described here provide a suitable way forward .",
    "the models give greater insight into the nature of subgroups in the data set , but interpretation can be problematic because of the number of parameters being estimated .",
    "we recommend the use of graphical displays on the worth scale .",
    "diagnostic checks are important for these models .",
    "it is important to examine the solution to check both that there are no overly small latent classes , and also that the parameter estimates for each mass point component are sufficiently separate [ @xcite ] .",
    "posterior probabilities of component membership could also be examined in relation to other covariates not in the model to aid interpretation of the latent classes [ @xcite ] .",
    "the basic model described in this paper can be extended in various ways :    * extensions to models which allow varying coefficients with latent classes is straightforward .",
    "this model will allow for different respondent covariate effects within each latent class .",
    "these random coefficient models can be fitted by allowing interactions between the latent class group and the covariates , but with the disadvantage of a sizeable increase in the number of model parameters . *",
    "it is possible to extend the model to allow for tied ranks .",
    "such data will lead to an underlying ordinal paired comparison model [ @xcite ] .",
    "* item covariates could also be included along the lines suggested by @xcite . *",
    "the model presented here needs to be extended to allow explicitly for more complex sampling designs and other multilevel structures which may be present in the data .",
    "further research is needed on this topic . *",
    "finally , incomplete or partial rankings could also be taken account of .",
    "this would lead to a paired comparison model which allows for missing comparisons within a response .",
    "the basic idea here is to extend the set of response patterns to include patterns where certain comparisons are not available . for partial rankings",
    "a composite link approach to this problem has been described in @xcite ; the general case for paired comparisons with missing data is treated in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the number of response patterns may increase dramatically and , thus , this approach is computationally feasible only for a small number of items .    in conclusion",
    ", our approach provides a methodology which allows the modeling of ranked data in many applied areas , allowing covariates to be taken into account and latent classes to be detected .",
    "the underlying paired comparison approach provides an attractive alternative to the choice based models dominant in the literature .",
    "this research was supported by the esrc under the national centre for research methods initiative ( grant numbers res-576 - 25 - 5020 and res-576 - 25 - 0019 ) .",
