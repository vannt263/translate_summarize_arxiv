    "the _ standard model of the electroweak and colour interactions _ ( extended by the right handed neutrinos ) , fiting with around 25 assumptions and parameters all the existing experimental data , leaves unanswered many open questions , among which are the questions about the origin of the charges ( @xmath3 ) , of the families , and correspondingly of the yukawa couplings of quarks and leptons and of the higgs mechanism . answering the question about the origin of families and their masses seems to me the most promising way leading beyond the today s knowledge about the elementary fermionic and bosonic fields .",
    "the _ approach unifying spins and charges _",
    "@xcite does have a chance to answer the above mentioned open questions .",
    "the question is , of course , whether and when the author   ( and collaborators ) will succeed to prove , that this theory really manifests in the low energy regime as the effective theory , postulated by the _",

    "a brief explanation of what does it offer ( section  [ predictions ] ) , iii . ) the so far made proofs and the obtained positive results ( section  [ lhcdarkmatter ] ) and at the end the open problems which are studying or are waiting to be studied ( section  [ kkandotherproblems ] ) .",
    "the _ approach _ assumes  @xcite a simple action in @xmath4-dimensional space @xmath5 with the lagrange density for a spinor , which carries in @xmath4 _ two kinds of the spin _ and _ no charges_. one kind of spin is _ the dirac spinor _ in @xmath6-dimensional space which , like in the kaluza - klein - like theories , takes care of the spin in @xmath2 and all the charges , and the _ second kind _ , the new one , which takes care of the families  .",
    "there exist only two kinds of spins , corresponding to the left and the right multiplication of the clifford algebra objects .",
    "the two kinds of spins are represented by the two kinds of the clifford algebra objects  @xcite @xmath7 the spinor interacts correspondingly only with the vielbeins @xmath8 and the two kinds of the spin connection fields , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 correspondingly there is the lagrange density for the gauge fields , assumed to be linear in the curvature @xmath12 } \\;(\\omega_{a b \\alpha,\\beta } - \\omega_{c a \\alpha } \\omega^{c}{}_{b \\beta } ) , \\tilde{r } = f^{\\alpha [ a } f^{\\beta b ] } \\;(\\tilde{\\omega}_{a b \\alpha,\\beta } - \\tilde{\\omega}_{c a \\alpha } \\tilde{\\omega}^{c}{}_{b \\beta } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it is also the torsion field @xmath13 } ) _ { , \\alpha } + \\omega_{[a}{}^{c}{}_{b ] }   f^{\\beta}_{c}$ ] .",

    "the action  eq.([action ] ) , which manifests the families ( through @xmath21 ) as the equivalent representations to the spinor representation of @xmath22 ( as can be seen in the last term of eq .",
    "( [ clifford ] ) ) , has a real chance to manifest after the spontaneous breaks of symmetries in the low energy regime , as i shall comment bellow ( sections  [ predictions ] ,  [ lhcdarkmatter ] ) , all the properties required by the _ standard model _ in order to fit the so far observed data .",
    "the _ approach _ does not only explain , for example , why the left handed spinors carry the weak charge while the right ones do not , and predicts that for the spontaneous breaks of symmetries the vielbeins together with both kinds of the spin connection fields are responsible , as they are also for the yukawa couplings and the appearance of the scalar fields , but explains the mechanism for the appearance of families , predicting the fourth family to be possibly seen at the lhc ( or at somewhat higher energies )  @xcite and the stable fifth family , whose neutrinos and baryons with masses several hundred tev/@xmath23 might explain the appearance of the dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the _ approach _ confronted and still confronts several problems ( among them are the problems common to all the kaluza - klein - like theories which have vielbeins and spin connections as the only gauge fields , without additional gauge fields in the bulk ) , which we are studying step by step when searching for possible ways of spontaneous breaking of the starting symmetries , leading to the properties of the observed families of fermions and gauge and scalar fields , and looking for predictions the _ approach _ is offering  @xcite .",
    "i kindly ask the reader to look for more detailed presentation of the _ approach _ in the refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "the action of eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) starts with the massless spinor , let say , of the left handedness .",
    "the spinor interacts with the vielbeins and through two kinds of spins ( @xmath22 and @xmath21 ) with the two kinds of the spin connection fields .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the dirac kind of the clifford algebra objects ( @xmath24 ) determines , when the group @xmath25 is analysed with respect to the _ standard model _ groups in @xmath2 the spin and all the so far observed charges , manifesting the left handed quarks and leptons carrying the weak charge and the right handed weak chargeless quarks and leptons  @xcite .",
    "accordingly the lagrange density @xmath26 ( eq .  [ action],[lspinor ] ) manifests after the appropriate breaks of the symmetries all the properties of one family of fermions as assumed by the _ standard model _ : the three kinds of charges coupling fermions to the corresponding gauge fields , as presented bellow in the first term on the right hand side of eq.([lsmyukawa ] ) .",
    "the second kind ( @xmath27 ) of the clifford algebra objects ( defining the equivalent representations with respect to the dirac one ) determines families .",
    "accordingly manifests the spinor lagrange density , after the breaks of the starting symmetry ( @xmath25 into @xmath28 and further into @xmath29 ) the _ standard model - like _ lagrange density for massless spinors of eight ( four @xmath30 four ) families ( defined by @xmath31 spinor states for each member of one family ) . in the first successive break , appearing at around @xmath32 gev ( or at a little lower scale ) , the upper four families ( in the yukawa couplings decoupled from the lower four families ) obtain masses , while the lower four families stay massless ( due to the fact that they are singlets with respect to the generators @xmath33 , forming one of the two @xmath34 groups ) and mass protected ( since only the left handed spinors carry the weak charge ) .",
    "the yukawa couplings are presented in the second term on the right hand side of eq.([lsmyukawa ] ) bellow .",
    "the third term @xmath35 in eq.([lsmyukawa ] ) can still contribute to the second break .",
    "@xmath36 here @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) determine the hyper ( @xmath39 ) , the weak ( @xmath40 ) and the colour ( @xmath41 ) charge : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the @xmath46 structure tensor .",
    "in the final break ( leading to @xmath47 , which is the _ standard model _ like break ) the last four families obtain masses .",
    "the two breaks appear at two very different scales and are caused by vielbeins and both kinds of the spin connection fields in any of these cases , manifesting the two kinds of the yukawa couplings and the two kinds of scalar fields .",
    "the last break influences also the masses and the mixing matrices of the upper four families ( in the yukawa couplings decoupled from the lower ones ) leading to the same gauge fields for all of the eight families  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly manifests the @xmath48 at observable energies all the three known gauge fields in the kaluza - klein - like way @xmath49 here @xmath50 the scalar fields and the gauge fields manifest through the vielbeins .",
    "the _ approach _ predicts two stable families ; the first and the fifth .",
    "the quarks with the lowest mass among the upper four families , clustered into fifth family baryons , are , together with the fifth family neutrinos , the candidates to form the dark matter . for detailed calculations",
    "the reader can look at the ref .",
    "although we can not ( yet , since it needs a lot of additional understanding and calculations ) tell how do these spontaneous breaks occur and at what energies do they occur , we still can make some estimations . at the break , which occurs at around @xmath32 gev and makes the upper four families massive , the lightest ( the stable one ) of this four families obtains the mass , which is higher than several hundreds gev ( to be in agreement with the experimental data and with the prediction of the _ approach _ that there are four rather than three families with nonzero mixing matrices ) and pretty lower than the scale of the break .",
    "it is also meaningful to assume that the second break , which appears at much lower ( that is weak scale ) will not influence the masses of the upper four families considerably . expressing the term @xmath51 of eq .",
    "( [ lsmyukawa ] ) in terms of the superposition of the @xmath52 and @xmath53 as dictated by the breaks , one ends up with the mass matrices first for the upper and , after the second break , for the lower four families  @xcite on the tree level .",
    "since the @xmath52 and @xmath53 are not known , we only see the symmetries of the mass matrices .    in the subsection  ( [ lhc ] )",
    "i present results of the estimations on the tree level of properties of the lower four families  @xcite , when the yukawa couplings from eq .",
    "( [ lsmyukawa ] ) were taken as parameter and fited to the existing experimental data .",
    "although we were not able to calculate the masses of the fourth family members , we calculated , for the assumed masses the mixing matrices , predicting that the fourth family might be seen at the lhc or at somewhat higher energies . in the subsection  ( [ darkmatter ] )",
    "i present how do the experimental data  the cosmological ones and the data from direct measurements  limit the properties of the fifth family quarks : the present dark matter density limits ( under the assumption that the fifth family baryons are mostly responsible for it ) their masses in the interval @xmath54 , while the direct measurements , if they measure our fifth family baryons , predict the masses @xmath55 .",
    "these estimations will serve as a guide to next more demanding studies of the predictions of the _",
    "approach_.      after the last break ( caused again by the vielbeins and the two kinds of the spin connection fields , connected now with the second @xmath56 symmetry break in the @xmath21 sector ) the action ( eq .",
    "[ lsmyukawa ] ) manifests the properties postulated by the _",
    "standard model _ : the massive gauge fields @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the massless @xmath59 and @xmath46 fields , the scalar filed ( the _ standard model _",
    "higgs ) and the mass matrices of quarks and leptons of the lower four families .",
    "it is a very difficult study to estimate the breaks and correspondingly the numerical values for parameters which the _ standard _ model fits from the experimental data .",
    "we are still able to tell something about the mass matrices , if taking into account the symmetries of them , which we evaluated on the tree level .",
    "the parameterised mass matrix is presented bellow  @xcite .",
    "@xmath60 the parameters @xmath61 distinguish among @xmath62 and @xmath63 , or @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( @xmath30 for @xmath62 and @xmath64 , and @xmath66 for @xmath63 and @xmath65 ) , while the parameters @xmath67 distinguish among all the members of one family .",
    "assuming that the contributions when going bellow the tree level would change the values and not the symmetries , and not paying attention on the @xmath68 non conservation ( studies of the discrete symmetries of the _ approach _ are under consideration ) , that is assuming that the parameters are real , we fit with the monte carlo program these parameters to the existing data for the three families within the known accuracy .",
    "we did this for quarks and leptons .",
    "we were not able to tell the masses of the fourth family members unless requiring an additional symmetry  @xcite .",
    "for _ the chosen values for the fourth family masses _",
    "( we took ( @xmath69 gev/@xmath23 for the @xmath70 respectively ) , we were able to evaluate the mixing matrices , which fit the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "we present bellow , as an example , the mass matrix for the @xmath71-quarks @xmath72 and the mixing matrix for the quarks @xmath73 we found the following masses of the four family members : @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we are now studying the properties of the yukawa couplings for the upper four and the lower four families bellow the tree level .",
    "although we can not tell the masses of the fourth family yet , we can predict that the fourth family will sooner or later be experimentally confirmed , and due to my understanding , at much lower energies than the supersymmetric partners .",
    "the _ approach _ predicts two times four families bellow the energy scale of @xmath32 gev .",
    "the upper four families obtain masses when one of the two @xmath56 symmetries in both sectors@xmath22 and @xmath21breaks .",
    "the break of the second @xmath56 symmetry influences the properties of the upper four families as well , so that they manifest the same charges and interact with the same gauge fields as the lower four families . it ( slightly )",
    "influences also their masses .",
    "the lowest of the four upper families is stable ( with respect to the age of the universe ) and is accordingly the candidate to answer the open question of both standard models ",
    "the electroweak and the cosmological  that is about the origin of the dark matter in the universe .",
    "we have much less data about the upper four families than about the lower four families .",
    "the only data about the upper four families follow from the known properties of the dark matter .    in what follows",
    "i briefly present the estimations of the main properties of the fifth family members , making the assumption that the fifth family neutron is the lightest fifth family baryon and that the neutrino is the lightest fifth family lepton   mev more to the mass of the first family proton that it does to the first family neutron mass , this repulsion energy is for the fifth family proton , which is made out of quarks of the masses of several hundreds tev/@xmath23 , @xmath76 gev(which is still only 1 per mil of the whole mass ) . ] .",
    "other possibilities are under consideration . for known masses of quarks and leptons of the fifth family members and for known phase transitions in the universe",
    "when expanding and cooling down , the behaviour of the fifth family members in the evolution of the universe as well as when the clusters of galaxies are formed and when they interact with the ordinary matter follow ( although the calculations are extremely demanded ) .",
    "we should know also the fifth family baryon / antibaryon asymmetry .",
    "we have not yet studied the masses and the mixing matrices for the upper four families and not yet the baryon / antibaryon asymmetry within the _ approach_. from what it is presented in subsection  [ lhc ] it follows that the masses of the fifth family members are above 1 tev/@xmath23 , since they are expected to be above the fourth family masses .",
    "we assume in what follows no baryon / antibaryon asymmetry , which , as we shall se , does not influence much the results for large enough masses ( above several tens tev/@xmath23 ) of the fifth family quarks . for high enough masses",
    "the one gluon exchange determines the properties of quarks in baryons as well as the quarks interaction with the cosmic plasma when the temperature is above @xmath77 gev/@xmath78 and correspondingly their freezing out of the plasma and their forming the fifth family neutrons during the expansion  @xcite .",
    "the fifth family baryons and antibaryons , decoupling from the plasma mostly before or during the phase transition , interact among themselves through the `` fifth family nuclear force '' , which is for the masses of the fifth family quarks of the order of several hundred tev/@xmath23 for a factor @xmath79 smaller than the ordinary ( first family ) nuclear force  @xcite .",
    "correspondingly the fifth family baryons and antibaryons interact in the dark matter clouds in the galaxies and among the galaxies , when they scatter , dominantly with the weak force . with the ordinary matter",
    "they interact through the `` fifth family nuclear force '' and are obviously not wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles , if wimps are meant to interact only with the weak force ) .",
    "we estimate that the fifth family neutrinos with masses above tev/@xmath23 and bellow @xmath80 tev/@xmath23 contribute to the dark matter and to the direct measurements less than the fifth family neutrons   gev/@xmath23 , are influenced by the colour phase transition as well .",
    "we estimate  @xcite that in the colour phase transition all coloured quarks and antiquarks either annihilate or form colourless clusters and decouple out of plasma ] .      to solve the coupled boltzmann equations for the number density of the fifth family quarks and the colourless clusters of the quarks in the plasma of all the other fermions ( quarks , leptons ) and bosons ( gauge fields ) in the thermal equilibrium in the expanding universe we estimate  @xcite the cross sections for the annihilation of quarks with antiquarks and for forming clusters .",
    "we do this within some uncertainty intervals , which take into account the roughness of our estimations . knowing only the interval for possible values of masses of the fifth family members we solve the boltzmann equations for several values of quark masses , following the decoupling of the fifth family quarks and the fifth family neutrons out of the plasma down to the temperature @xmath77 gev/@xmath78 when the colour phase transition starts .",
    "the fifth family neutrons and antineutrons , packed into very tiny clusters so that they are totally decoupled from the plasma , do not feel the colour phase transition , while the fifth family quarks and coloured clusters ( and antiquarks ) do .",
    "their scattering cross sections grow due to the nonperturbative behaviour of gluons ( as do the scattering cross sections of all the other quarks and antiquarks ) . while the three of the lowest four families decay into the first family quarks , due to the corresponding yukawa couplings , the fifth family quarks can not . having the binding energy a few orders of magnitude larger than @xmath77 gev and moving in the rest of plasma of the first family quarks and antiquarks and of the other three families and gluons as very heavy objects with large scattering cross section , the fifth family coloured objects annihilate with their partners or form the colourless clusters ( which result in the decoupling from the plasma ) long before the temperature falls bellow a few mev/@xmath78 when the first family quarks start to form the bound states .",
    "following further the fifth family quarks in the expanding universe up to today and equating the today s dark matter density with the calculated one , we estimated the mass interval of the fifth family quarks to be ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the detailed calculations with all the needed explanations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although the average properties of the dark matter in the milky way are pretty well known ( the average dark matter density at the position of our sun is expected to be @xmath82 , and the average velocity of the dark matter constituents around the centre of our galaxy is expected to be approximately velocity of our sun ) , their real local properties are known much less accurate , within the factor of @xmath83   from the centre of our galaxy travel in all possible circles around the centre so that the paths are spherically symmetrically distributed , the velocity of a cluster at the position of the earth is equal to @xmath84 , the velocity of our sun in the absolute value , but has all possible orientations perpendicular to the radius @xmath85 with equal probability . in the model that the clusters only oscillate through the centre of the galaxy , the velocities of the dark matter clusters at the earth position have values from zero to the escape velocity , each one weighted so that all the contributions give @xmath86 . ] .",
    "when evaluating  @xcite the number of events which our fifth family members ( or any stable heavy family baryons or neutrinos ) trigger in the direct measurements of dama  @xcite and cdms  @xcite experiments , we take into account all these uncertainties as well as the uncertainties in the theoretical estimation and the experimental treatments .",
    "let the dark matter member hits the earth with the velocity @xmath87 .",
    "the velocity of the earth around the centre of the galaxy is equal to : @xmath88 , with @xmath89 km / s and @xmath90 , @xmath91 km / s .",
    "the dark matter cluster of the @xmath92- th velocity class hits the earth with the velocity : @xmath93 .",
    "then the flux of our dark matter clusters hitting the earth is : @xmath94 @xmath95 .",
    "the last term determines the annual modulations observed by dama  @xcite .",
    "we estimate ( due to experimental data and our theoretical evaluations ) that @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    the cross section for our fifth family baryon to elastically scatter on an ordinary nucleus with @xmath98 nucleons is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the mass of the ordinary nucleus   fm",
    ", it is very massive ( a few hundreds tev/@xmath23 ) .",
    "when a quark of the ordinary nucleus scatter on it , the whole nucleus scatters with it , since at the recoil energies the quarks are strongly bound . ] .",
    "since scattering is expected to be coherent the cross section is almost independent of the recoil velocity of the nucleus .",
    "accordingly is the cross section @xmath101 , with @xmath102 , which is @xmath103 , with @xmath104 ( taking into account the roughness with which we treat our heavy baryon s properties and the scattering procedure ) when the  nuclear force  dominates . in all the expressions",
    "the index @xmath105 denotes the fifth family cluster , while the index @xmath106 denotes the ordinary nucleus .",
    "then the number of events per second ( @xmath107 ) taking place in @xmath108 nuclei of some experiment is due to the flux @xmath109 equal to @xmath110 where we estimate that @xmath111 demonstrates the uncertainties in the knowledge about the dark matter dynamics in our galaxy and our approximate treating of the dark matter properties , while @xmath112 determines the uncertainties in the detections . taking these evaluations into account",
    "we predict that if dama  @xcite is measuring our fifth family ( any heavy stable ) baryons then cdms  @xcite ( or some other experiment ) will measure in a few years these events as well  @xcite provided that our fifth family quarks masses are higher than @xmath55 .",
    "i demonstrated in my talk that the _ approach unifying spin and charges _ , which assumes in @xmath113dimensional space a simple action for a gravitational field ( manifesting with the spin connections and the vielbeins ) and massless fermions carrying only _ two kinds of the spin _ ( the one presented by the dirac matrices and the additional one anticommuting with the dirac one  there is no the third kind of the spin ) , no charges , shows a new way beyond the _ standard model of the electroweak and colour interactions_. it namely , for example , explains the origin of families , of the yukawa couplings , of the charges , the appearing of the corresponding gauge fields and of the ( two kinds of ) scalar fields , it explains why only the left handed spinors carry the weak charge while the right handed ones do not , where does the dark matter originate , and others .",
    "the action manifests at low ( observable ) energies after particular breaks of symmetries two times four families , with no yukawa couplings ( in comparison with the age of the universe ) among the lower and the upper four families .",
    "the _ approach _ predicts the fourth family , to be possibly observed at the lhc or at somewhat higher energies and the stable fifth family , whose baryons and neutrinos form the dark matter .",
    "i discussed briefly the properties of the lower four families , estimated at the tree level .",
    "following the history of the fifth family members in the expanding universe up to today and estimating also the scattering properties of this fifth family on the ordinary matter , the evaluated masses of the fifth family quarks , under the assumption that the lowest mass fifth family baryon is the fifth family neutron , are in the interval @xmath114 the fifth family neutrino mass is estimated to be in the interval : a few tev @xmath115 a few hundreds tev .      in the sections  ( [ conclusion],[introduction ] ) the promising sides of the _ approach unifying spin and charges _",
    "are briefly over viewed and in the rest of talk the achievements presented .",
    "one of the conclusions we can make is that  since there are two kinds of the clifford algebra objects and not only one ( successfully used by dirac 80 years ago ) describing the spin of fermions and in the _ approach _ the spin and the charges , and since the other generates the equivalent representations with respect to the first one , while the families are the equivalent representations with respect to the spin and the charges  the second kind of the spin can be used to describe families , or even must , since if not , we should explain , why only one kind of the spin manifests at the low energy regime .",
    "there are , however , several questions which should be solved before accepting the _ approach _ as the right way beyond the _ standard model _ , offering the right explanation for the origin of families , charges and gauge fields .",
    "since the _ approach _ assumes that the dimension of the space time is larger than ( 1 + 3 ) , like do the kaluza - klein - like theories as well as the theories with strings and membranes , it must be asked what is at all the dimension of the space - time . what does cause or trigger the spontaneous breaks of symmetries in the evolution of the universe ? what does determine the phase transitions ?",
    "we put a lot of efforts in understanding the properties of higher dimensional spaces and in understanding the properties of fermions after breaking symmetries .",
    "the reader can find more about our understanding and the proposed solutions in the references  @xcite .",
    "it is hard to evaluate how do the spontaneous ( non adiabatic ) breaks occur , what causes them and how do they influence the properties of all kinds of fields . to understand better the differences in the properties of a family members",
    ", we are estimating their properties bellow the tree level .",
    "is it the expectation that there are effects bellow the tree level which are responsible for the differences in properties of family members ( although some differences manifest already on the tree level ) correct ? will such calculations show that the fifth family @xmath71-quark is heavier than the @xmath116-quark mainly due to the repulsive electrostatic contribution ( @xmath117 gev ) ?",
    "the estimation of the behaviour of the coloured fifth family clusters during the colour phase transition leads to the conclusion that the fifth family quarks either annihilate or form the fifth family neutrons or antineutrons .",
    "will more accurate evaluations confirm this estimation ?",
    "how many of the fifth family neutrinos and neutrons annihilate in the interval bellow the weak phase transition due to possibly large weak cross section for the annihilation in this region ?",
    "many a question presented here are under consideration , many of them not even written here wait to be studied .",
