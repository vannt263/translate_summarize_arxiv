    "the impact of a drop onto a pool surface has been studied for over a century , but revolutionary improvements in high - speed video technology @xcite have recently opened up this canonical geometry to renewed scrutiny .",
    "this applies especially to the earliest contact between the drop and pool , where intricate details have emerged and play a crucial role during air entrapment and splashing @xcite .",
    "the impact of a drop always entraps a bubble under the center of the drop , as a disk of air is produced by the lubrication pressure and rapidly contracts into a bubble at the center @xcite . following this central air disk entrapment on a liquid pool",
    ", the outer contact forms a neck , which emits an ejecta sheet for sufficiently large reynolds numbers @xcite .",
    "these ejecta are the source of the finest spray droplets @xcite , which is of relevance to numerous processes , such as combustion and aerosol formation",
    ".    however , at even larger impact energy , these ejecta give way to random splashing of small droplets , see @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite have shown that the base of the ejecta can become unstable , bending up and down as the free surface sheds alternate sign vortex rings into the liquid and often entrapping bubble rings .",
    "these bubble rings alternate between the top and bottom sides of the ejecta .",
    "this regime is the focus of the current investigation .",
    "very recent experiments @xcite have used side - view and laser - induced fluorescence to verify the presence of the von krmn street for conditions similar to those in @xcite .",
    "herein we show the first experimental observations of the formation of the bubble tori .",
    "the main axisymmetric features of the vortex street and bubble rings entrapments are observed experimentally .",
    "however , three - dimensional effects rapidly break the symmetry . herein , we show that even at rather modest impact velocities , azimuthal instabilities can appear in the neck between the drop and the pool .",
    "imaging using two different liquids also reveals the shedding of streamwise vortices and their intricate dynamics , similar to three - dimensional instabilities of the cylinder wake @xcite , or the shear layer @xcite .",
    "these intricate structures have perhaps escaped earlier experimental notice as they develop in a sub - millimeter region and evolve in less than 50  @xmath0s .",

    "the difference in refractive index between the water drop and the ethanol or methanol pools allows us to image the flow structures as they distort the interface between the two liquids .",
    "the use of shallow pools , or thin films , is dictated by the need to change the pool liquid following every impact as well as by the optical setup , where the limited focal distance of the long - distance microscope rules out bottom views through deep pools .",
    "the pool depths @xmath3 were varied from about 25 @xmath0 m to 1 mm .",

    "some of the imaging was also done at a lower frame rate with a photron sa5 cmos camera , with a magnification up to 10 and maximum pixel resolution @xmath5m / px .",
    "using thin bottom layers restricts the vertical motion of the interface between the drop and the pool liquid during the impact , thereby making well - focused imaging easier with the limited focal distance . for further optical / triggering details",
