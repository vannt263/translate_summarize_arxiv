    "the casimir effect is one of the most interesting macroscopic manifestations of the nontrivial structure of the vacuum state in quantum field theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the effect is a phenomenon common to all systems characterized by fluctuating quantities and results from changes in the vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field that occur because of the imposition of boundary conditions or the choice of topology .",
    "it may have important implications on all scales , from cosmological to subnuclear , and has become in recent decades an increasingly popular topic in quantum field theory .",
    "it is well known that the uniqueness of the vacuum state is lost when we work within the framework of quantum field theory in a general curved spacetime or in non  inertial frames . in particular , the use of general coordinate transformations in quantum field theory in flat spacetime leads to an infinite number of unitary inequivalent representations of the commutation relations .",
    "different inequivalent representations will in general give rise to different vacuum states .",
    "for instance , the vacuum state for a uniformly accelerated observer , the fulling ",
    "rindler vacuum full73,boul75,unru76,full77,gerl89 , turns out to be inequivalent to that for an inertial observer , the familiar minkowski vacuum .",
    "quantum field theory in accelerated systems contains many special features produced by a gravitational field .",
    "in particular , the near horizon geometry of most black holes is well approximated by rindler spacetime and a better understanding of physical effects in this background could serve as a handle to deal with more complicated geometries like schwarzschild .",
    "the rindler geometry shares most of the qualitative features of black holes and is simple enough to allow detailed analysis .",
    "another motivation for the investigation of quantum effects in the rindler space is related to the fact that this space is conformally related to de sitter space and to robertson  walker space with negative spatial curvature .",
    "as a result the expectation values of the energy  momentum tensor for conformally invariant fields and for corresponding conformally transformed boundaries on the de sitter and robertson  walker backgrounds can be generated from the corresponding rindler counterpart by the standard transformation ( see , for instance , birrell ) .",
    "an interesting topic in the investigations of the casimir effect is the dependence of the vacuum characteristics on the type of the vacuum .",
    "vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor induced by an infinite plane boundary moving with uniform proper acceleration through the fulling - rindler vacuum was studied by candelas and deutsch @xcite for the conformally coupled @xmath0 dirichlet and neumann massless scalar and electromagnetic fields . in this paper only the region of the right rindler wedge to the right of the barrier is considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the wightman function and the vacuum energy - momentum tensor for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter , satisfying the robin boundary conditions on the infinite plane in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions and for the electromagnetic field .",
    "we have considered both regions , including the one between the barrier and rindler horizon .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor for scalar fields with dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions and for the electromagnetic field in the geometry of two parallel plates moving by uniform accelerations are investigated in ref .",
    "in particular , the vacuum forces acting on the boundaries are evaluated .",
    "they are presented as a sum of the interaction and self - action parts .",
    "the interaction forces between the plates are always attractive for both scalar and electromagnetic cases . due to the well - known surface divergences in the boundary parts , the total casimir energy can not be obtained by direct integration of the vacuum energy density and needs an additional renormalization . in ref .",
    "@xcite by using the zeta function technique , the casimir energy is evaluated for massless scalar fields under dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions , and for the electromagnetic field with perfect conductor boundary conditions on one and two parallel plates .",
    "on background of manifolds with boundaries , the physical quantities , in general , will receive both volume and surface contributions and the surface terms play an important role in various branches of physics .",
    "an expression for the surface energy - momentum tensor for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in the general case of bulk and boundary geometries is derived in ref . @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the vacuum expectation value of the surface energy - momentum tensor is evaluated for a massles scalar field obeying robin boundary condition on an infinite plane moving by uniform proper acceleration . by using the conformal relation between the rindler and de sitter spacetimes and the results from @xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite the vacuum energy - momentum tensor for a scalar field is evaluated in de sitter spacetime in presence of a curved brane on which the field obeys the robin boundary condition with coordinate dependent coefficients .    in the present paper",
    "the wightman function and the vacuum expectation value of the field square the energy - momentum tensor are investigated for a massive scalar field with an arbitrary curvature coupling parameter obeying the robin boundary conditions on two parallel branes moving by uniform proper accelerations through the fulling - rindler vacuum .",
    "the general case is considered when the constants in the boundary conditions are different for separate plates .",
    "robin type conditions are an extension of dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions and appear in a variety of situations , including the considerations of vacuum effects for a confined charged scalar field in external fields @xcite , spinor and gauge field theories , quantum gravity and supergravity @xcite .",
    "robin conditions can be made conformally invariant , while purely - neumann conditions can not .",
    "thus , robin - type conditions are needed when one deals with conformally invariant theories in the presence of boundaries and wishes to preserve this invariance .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quantum scalar field satisfying the robin condition on the boundary of cavity violates the bekenstein s entropy - to - energy bound near certain points in the space of the parameter defining the boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the robin boundary conditions are an extension of those imposed on perfectly conducting boundaries and may , in some geometries , be useful for depicting the finite penetration of the field into the boundary with the skin - depth parameter related to the robin coefficient .",
    "robin boundary conditions naturally arise for scalar and fermion bulk fields in the randall - sundrum model gher00,flac01b , saha05 . in this model",
    "the bulk geometry is a slice of anti - de sitter space and the corresponding robin coefficients are related to the curvature scale of the space .",
    "the outline of this paper is the following . in the next section the wightman function",
    "is considered .",
    "the corresponding mode - sum is evaluated by using the generalized abel - plana summation formula @xcite .",
    "this allows us to extract from the corresponding vacuum expectation values the wightman function for the geometry of a single plate and to present the remained part in the form of the exponentially convergent integrals .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the field square and the casimir energy - momentum tensor is evaluated in section [ sec : vevemt ] .",
    "various limiting cases are considered . in section [ sec : intforce ] we investigate the vacuum interaction forces between the plates as functions on corresponding proper accelerations .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] contains a summary of the work and some suggestions for further research . in appendix",
    "[ section : app1 ] on the base of the generalized abel - plana formula , a summation formula is derived for the series over zeros of a combination of the bessel modified functions with an imaginary order .",

    "for special cases of minimally and conformally coupled scalars one has @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . our main interest in this paper will be the wightman function , the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the field square and the energy - momentum tensor in the rindler spacetime induced by two parallel plates moving with uniform proper acceleration when the quantum field is prepared in the fulling - rindler vacuum .",

    "the rindler time coordinate @xmath17 is proportional to the proper time along a family of uniformly accelerated trajectories which fill the rindler wedge , with the proportionality constant equal to the acceleration .",

    "all results below will depend , of course , on the ratios @xmath27 only . however , to keep the transition to dirichlet and neumann cases transparent , we write the boundary conditions in the form ( [ dboundcond ] ) .",
