    "dispersive shock waves ( dsws ) have been the subject of intense research in the field of nonlinear waves , with specific applications in bose - einstein condensation @xcite and nonlinear optics @xcite , and are part of the large number of hydrodynamic - like phenomena @xcite that are considered important because of their links with quantum fluids @xcite , turbulence @xcite , disordered and curved systems @xcite , and their application to laser physics @xcite .    with specific reference to nonlinear optics , much effort has been devoted to the formation of the dsws .",
    "however , all the reported theoretical investigations in the spatial domain are based on the paraxial approximation of the propagation equation of the electromagnetic field , within the validity of the hydrodynamical approach .",
    "shock waves are highly nonlinear processes that induce a substantial amount of spectral broadening .",
    "we hence expect that non - paraxial terms are relevant in the development of the wave - breaking phenomena .",
    "an open issue is the identification of possible experimental signatures of these effects .",
    "indeed , non - paraxiality was previously investigated in the formation of solitons @xcite , however , so far , non - paraxial dsws have not been considered .    in this manuscript",
    "we investigate theoretically and numerically the effect of non - paraxiality in the dsws , and find that it limits the broadening of the spatial spectrum in the very same way special relativity limits the achievable velocities for a massive particle in the presence of a conservative force . in recent literature various authors have outlined analogies between nonlinear optics and relativistic regimes in the specific case of pulse propagation @xcite . here",
    "we extend the analogy to the phenomenon of the dsws also in the spatial domain .",
    "this manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we review the leading model and the derivation of the hydrodynamic limit . in section iii , we describe the link with relativistic dynamics and the way this link allows to predict the maximum phase gradient ( velocity ) and the shock point in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case . in section iv , we report the numerical simulations of the leading model in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case .",
