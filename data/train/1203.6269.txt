    "it is well known that the supernovae ( sne ) ia have a significant intrinsic brightness due to their very homogenous initial conditions , i.e. thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs .",
    "for this reason they are among the best standard candles providing cosmological distance determination , with a precision of approximately 8% , and thus determination of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the detection of sne ia thus turns out to be essential in order to probe the cosmological expansion ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "after the first systematic efforts to detect low  redshift ( @xmath8 ) sne ia , carried out by the caln / tololo supernova survey @xcite , several international teams , the supernova cosmological project ( scp ) and the high - z sn search ( hzsns ) performed extensive searches for sne ia at high redshift ( out to @xmath9 ) @xcite . in the wake of these successful experiments , a fit of the magnitude - redshift data of 42 sne ia ( at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83 ) , discovered by the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) , jointly with a set of 18 supernovae from the caln / tololo supernova survey , was performed at redshifts below 0.1 @xcite . practically , this study compared the distance modulus of the measured sne ia with that which would be expected for an einstein  de sitter flat universe , leading to the truly surprising discovery of a positive vacuum energy density ( @xmath10 ) , i.e. the _ dark energy _ , which opposes the self  attraction of matter and causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate ( for a review , see refs .",
    "this result is consistent with the full sky temperature maps based on seven years of data from wmap , which are well fit by a minimal six - parameter flat @xmath2cdm model .",
    "in fact , by using the wmap data in conjunction with baryon acoustic oscillation data from the sloan digital sky survey and priors on the hubble constant @xmath11 from hubble space telescope observations , it was possible to estimate that @xmath12 @xcite .    in more recent years , several large - scale ground - based projects have been started @xcite , the hubble space telescope playing a key role in high - precision optical and infrared follow - up of sne discovered from the ground .",
    "it was therefore possible to draw up new sn ia compilations , combining high - redshift ( @xmath13 ) with low - redshift ( @xmath14 ) samples , collected in different projects @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding cosmological constraints were consistent with a very wide range of dark energy models . this fact is basically caused by statistical errors but , most importantly , by systematic uncertainties as well . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the statistical uncertainties in measurements of dark energy parameters are on the same order as systematic uncertainties .",
    "moreover , the different results significantly depend on which light curve fitter has been used .",
    "this fact clearly emerges from subsequent works @xcite .",
    "it is also remarkable to note that the constraints on the value of @xmath15 , which is the main goal of this research , depend strongly on redshift of the sne ia .",
    "in fact , the data at @xmath16 are not able to provide robust constraints on the existence of the dark energy .",
    "lastly , the physical nature of the dark energy is at the moment lost in the meanders of theoretical speculations .    in the present paper ,",
    "we challenge the current standard model of cosmology , the @xmath17cdm model , which includes the cosmological constant as an essential feature . in particular we debate on the use of the stretch factor that intervenes in the sn ia light curves to modify the time axis around the peak of the luminosity .",
    "actually , without this empirical transformation , the light curves of different sne ia are not congruent with each other , but have a shape and a maximum that differ substantially among the samples .",
    "however , we believe that any correction applied on the apparent magnitude of each sne ia implies a correction on its corresponding redshift , as we discuss in section 2 . from this perspective",
    "we have reanalysed the so  called `` union compilation '' , which is a compilation of 414 sne ia ( which reduces to 307 after selection cuts ) provided by ref . @xcite",
    "together with a framework to analyze datasets in a homogeneous manner .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in  [ sec02 ]",
    "we introduce the correction that we carried on the redshift of sne . in  [ sec03 ]",
    "we explain the fitting procedure and the selection cuts on the original sample that have led to the compilation of two subsets .",
    "the resulting parameters of the fits are reported together with the hubble diagrams . finally , in ",
    "[ sec04 ] we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of sne measured by different groups at different redshifts must be corrected , before putting them together in the hubble diagram , in such way that the absolute magnitude can be considered the same constant for all the sne forming the sample .",
    "the photometric images are corrected for galactic extinction , @xmath18correction , etc .",
    ", and finally undergo a light - curve width - luminosity correction @xcite . the light curve of each sn is compared with a template and the peak apparent magnitude is corrected assuming a functional form @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a coefficient that will be determined by a fitting algorithm , simultaneously with the other cosmological parameters ; @xmath21 is the so called `` stretch factor '' that suitably stretches or contracts the time axis of each light curve around the date of maximum light , affecting both the rising and declining part of the light curve of each sn .",
    "the stretch factor was introduced to reduce the intrinsic dispersion in the absolute brightness of supernovae , but it really acts as a physical mechanism and it was first considered due to a local astrophysical effect ( for example the temperature - dependent variation in the opacity ) by the authors in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , four years later , they same authors admitted that : `` _ _ a single stretch factor varying the timescale of the sne ia accounts very well for the restframe @xmath22 band light curve both before and after maximum light _ _ '' but `` _ _ it is not understood from the current status of the theory of sne ia whether this is a fortuitous coincidence or a reflection of some physics timescale _ _ '' @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the sne ia light curves is usually interpreted as a strong support for time dilation due to an expanding universe .",
    "however , non - standard cosmological models have been suggested as alternative explanations for acceleration without dark energy . as a matter of fact , if we use a model - independent method to compare quantitatively the ability of some dark energy models and non - standard types of cosmology ( braneworld , @xmath23 , kinematic models , etc . ) to represent the union2 sample data @xcite , none of the considered cosmological models can be rigorously rejected on the basis of the current sn ia data @xcite .",
    "here we propose an alternative view of the stretch factor that we interpret as a virtual displacement of the supernova from the measured redshift to a new effective redshift .",
    "actually the width of the light curves is larger for sne ia at higher redshift ( @xmath24 ) than it is for local ones .",
    "in fact , due to redshift , the observed width evolves by a _ time - dilatator _",
    "factor @xmath25 .",
    "still the same authors @xcite adjusted the scp and caln / tololo photometric data to the maximum intensity @xmath26 and scaled the time axis by a width factor @xmath27 .",
    "remarkably , with the application of this single stretch timescale parameter , the sne ia data fell all on a common curve at the level of the measurement uncertainty .",
    "however , in our opinion , the correction of the apparent magnitude should be balanced by a correspondent correction of the redshift .",
    "in fact , since the transformation from the observer frame to the sn rest frame is obtained by dividing the time interval by the factor @xmath28 , this is equivalent to consider a time - dilatator factor @xmath29 , and sne shall not be considered at redshift @xmath30 anymore , but at somewhat corrected redshift @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 in the light of our interpretation of the stretch factor , we think that the sn ia data have to be refitted by using the above corrected redshift , which takes into account nothing else than the correction of the apparent magnitude of sne adducted by the scientists of the scp on the photometric data .",
    "we considered the data reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , even if these authors did not strictly preserved the original meaning of @xmath21 . actually , in the recent update of the sne sample @xcite the meaning of the stretch factor was completely lost because the new fitting algorithm salt2 returns a parameter @xmath33 that must be converted to the old @xmath21 using a correlation formula that would become a source of other statistical errors .",
    "the effective magnitude of the @xmath34th of the @xmath35 sne forming our modified sample is obtained from the formula : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the rest frame color at maximum as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath38 is an additional parameter , which has been determined by the fitting procedure too .",
    "the @xmath39 corresponding to that of eq.([eq_03 ] ) is given as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the hubble free luminosity distance @xmath42 @xmath43 is the magnitude zero point offset @xmath44 @xmath45 is the speed of light , and @xmath46 is the absolute magnitude which is assumed to be constant after that the above mentioned corrections of apparent magnitudes have been implemented .",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the errors related to the magnitude , stretch factor , and color factor , respectively .",
    "we neglected the errors on @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we considered an error due to a peculiar velocity dispersion of @xmath50 km sec@xmath51 , which can be written : @xmath52 furthermore , we supposed that our universe is flat , so that @xmath53 .",
    "we found a minimum of our @xmath39 in eq.([eq_04 ] ) starting from an intrinsic dispersion of the relation @xmath54 , and we updated this value refitting until we have obtained a reduced @xmath55 .",
    "to this aim we used the `` newton method search for a minimum '' developed in mathematica in a way very similar to the algorithm adopted in ref .",
    "the same results can be equivalently obtained using iteratively the `` nonlinearregress '' functionality of mathematica .",
    "we applied this procedure to the standard sample of 307 sne ia reported in ref .",
    "the resulting four parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath43 , @xmath20 , @xmath38 ) of the fitting procedure are listed in table [ table_1 ] , which clearly shows , in the first row , a difference of more than @xmath56 in the estimate of @xmath4 between our procedure and the well known standard result .",
    "next , we corrected the measured redshift @xmath30 by eq.([eq_02 ] ) , and after this correction , we neglected the 35 following sne because their @xmath31 are now negative : 1993ag , 1993o , 1993h , 1992br , 1992bp , 1992bo , 1992bl , 1992aq , 1990af , 2001cn , 2000bh , 1993ac , 1994 m , 1994 t , 1995ak , 1996bo , 2000fa , 2000dk , 2000cn , 2000cf , 1999gd , 1999ek , 1999cc , 1998eg , 1998ef , 1998dx , 1998co , 1998ab , 1998v , 1997dg , 1997y , 1999bm , 1995ap , h283 , n326 .",
    "c c c c c c c c @xmath30 & @xmath35 & @xmath4 & @xmath43 & @xmath20 & @xmath38 & @xmath57 & @xmath58 + normal & 307 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & 0.25 & 1.056 + corrected & 252 & @xmath63 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 & 0.32 & 1.005 + corrected & 242 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & 0.20 & 1.075 +    [ table_1 ]    then , we considered the remaining 272 sne , and we made a fitting test without taking into account the measurement errors , and imposing @xmath7 . actually , we did not want a really blind analysis of the data , but we wanted to test if the einstein - de sitter model , without any cosmological constant , should really be excluded from the cosmological theory .",
    "considering the parameters resulting from the test fit , 20 sne were removed from the 272 sn sample having the highest residuals with respect to the einstein - de sitter model ; they are : 1992ag , 1992ae , 1992p , 1990o , 1999gp , 1994s , 1999aa , 1999ao , 1999aw , 1996j , 1996cl , 2001jn , 2001jf , 040 mb , 04sas , 2003dy , e138 , g142 , k396 , p534 . after this selection cut",
    ", we applied our fitting procedure considering also the measurement errors and the corresponding results are listed in the second line of table 1 . with respect to the 307 sn data set , we obtained a completely different estimation of the mass density , i.e. @xmath71 .    in order to verify the stability of our result , we removed other 10 sne from our sample ( 1992bc , 2001cz , 1995ac , 1995ao , 2002w , 04d3df , 03d1 cm , bo10 , g055 , m138 ) .",
    "this time , the value of @xmath4 changed again and became equal to the unity , causing the vanishing of any form of dark energy .",
    "note that the minimum of @xmath39 in the last case falls outside the range of the allowed values @xmath72 .",
    "so we have computed some three parameters fits for fixed values of @xmath73 in the right range .",
    "the result is that @xmath39 is a decreasing function of @xmath74 that has the smallest acceptable value just when we put @xmath75 .",
    "the values of the remaining three parameters are reported in table [ table_1 ] .",
    "the behavior of the hubble diagrams are shown in figures [ fig_01 ] and [ fig_02 ] for the 252 and the 242 sn subset , respectively .    , @xmath76 ) .",
    "]    , @xmath77 ) . ]    by inspection of table [ table_1 ] , it is evident that the absolute magnitude and the parameter @xmath38 are stable for the three samples .",
    "instead , the cosmological parameter @xmath4 changes drastically , and also the parameter @xmath20 derived using @xmath31 is very different from the one obtained with the standard @xmath30 .",
    "the reason of the latter difference can be explained expanding `` @xmath78 '' in the equation ( 5 ) around @xmath79 . at the first order in @xmath80",
    "we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 if we insert this result in the equation ( 4 ) we can write @xmath83 in terms of the normal @xmath30 . comparing it with the corresponding standard @xmath84 we obtain @xmath85 in the sum .",
    "so , considering @xmath86 , which is the average value of @xmath87 in our sample , the estimates of @xmath20 listed in table [ table_1 ] , when we use the corrected redshift , are in effect @xmath88 .",
    "we introduced a correction on the redsfhit of the sne ia that takes into account the correction of the corresponding luminosity , which is commonly performed in order to gets all the sn light curves to match . in this framework , we reanalyzed the union compilation @xcite finding the following results :    * we refitted the set of 307 type ia sne by a fitting procedure based on the newton method search for a minimum .",
    "the constraint we obtained from supernovae on the dark energy density is @xmath89 , which is quite different from the result of @xmath90 found in ref .",
    "this outcome reflects the fact that the fit of the sne is very sensible to the fitting procedure and to the systematic and intrinsic errors inserted in the @xmath39 .",
    "* we corrected the redshift of the sne according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_02 ] ) , and neglected the sne whose redshift turned out to be negative .",
    "after a selection cut based on the residuals , we reduced the original compilation to two subsets formed by 252 and 242 sne respectively .",
    "fitting the first subset , we found that the values of the cosmological parameters were practically reversed ( @xmath91 , @xmath76 ) . on the other hand , from the fit of the second subset we find even @xmath7 , which corresponds to a universe without dark energy .",
    "* the fits of the sne , both with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , depend on the number of sne used too .",
    "the difference of few sne between two samples changes dramatically the estimates of the cosmological parameters .",
    "the above mentioned case of the two subsets formed by 252 and 242 sne respectively is emblematic .    in conclusion , we found that the constraint on the cosmological parameters based on the analysis of sne is contingent on both fitting procedure and the number of sne considered in the sample . on the contrary ,",
    "the absolute magnitudes of sne are not affected by variations in the sample .",
    "we emphasize that it is well known that the hypothesis according to which the universe is accelerating comes not only from the results of sne ia , but also from the analysis of cmb and galaxy clusters .",
    "the latter two methods converge on a result of @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the present work is not intended to replace the current paradigm of the cosmology ( even if the debate is still alive @xcite ) , but only to point out that the use of sne ia in the estimate of cosmological parameters can introduce , through the stretch factor , some instability in the final result , in addition to biases and discrepancies in the sn ia data samples .",
    "so , all the results that come from the sne ia must be taken with more caution , especially when they are used to discriminate between different cosmological models .",
    "the data of the original _ union compilation _ has been downloaded from http://supernova.lbl.gov /union .",
