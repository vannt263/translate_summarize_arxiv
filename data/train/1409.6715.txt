    "the search for topological states of quantum matter has attracted intensive interest in condensed matter physics  @xcite . the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) ,",
    "discovered in 2d electron systems in 1980s  @xcite , was the first topological quantum state different from any other quantum states known before . in the qhe , the electronic states of the 2d electron system form landau levels ( lls ) under strong external magnetic fields , which is topologically distinct from vacuum .",
    "the 2d bulk of the sample is an insulator , while the edge of the sample is electrically conductive .",
    "the flow of this chiral current is dissipationless and results in a quantized hall resistance @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the planck constant , @xmath2 is the electron charge , and @xmath3 is an integer .",
    "the exactly quantized hall resistance is because it is characterized by a topological invariant @xmath3 , which is the first chern number  @xcite and is independent of material details .    in principle",
    ", the qhe can exist without the external magnetic field and the associated lls ; however , the haldane model  @xcite with circulating currents on a honeycomb lattice is not easy to implement experimentally .",
    "the qah effect , considered as a quantized version of anomalous hall effect discovered in 1881  @xcite , has been theoretically proposed for magnetic topological insulators ( tis )  @xcite , where the ferromagnetic ordering and spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) are sufficiently strong that they can give rise to a topologically nontrivial phase with a finite chern number .",
    "the rich material choice of time - reversal - invariant tis open up a new way to the experimental realization of the qah effect .",
    "a 2d ti is expected to show the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect  @xcite , in which , a pair of spin - filtered counter - propagating helical edge states flows without dissipation and contributes to a quantized longitudinal resistance . the qsh effect has been realized and observed experimentally in both hgte / cdte  @xcite and inas / gasb  @xcite quantum wells .",
    "3d tis with a insulating bulk and gapless 2d dirac - type surface states on each surface , have been observed in bi@xmath4sb@xmath5 alloy  @xcite and in bi@xmath6se@xmath7 family compounds .",
    "bi@xmath6se@xmath7 , bi@xmath6te@xmath7 , and sb@xmath6te@xmath7 compounds have a large bulk gap and single dirac surface band  @xcite .",
    "the qah effect can be naturally achieved by introducing ferromagnetism ( fm ) into the tis that breaks the time - reversal ( tr ) symmetry . in a 2d ti",
    ", fm can suppress one of spin channels of the qsh edge states , driving the system into a qah phase  @xcite .",
    "magnetization in a 3d ti gaps out the dirac fermions at each surface perpendicular to the magnetization vector , and leads to a qhe with a half qh conductance ( @xmath8 )  @xcite . in a 3d ti film with perpendicular magnetization , the gapped surface bands at top and bottom surfaces have distinct topological characters due to their opposite normal directions .",
    "thus the edge of the sample can be viewed as a domain wall between the upper and lower surface bands , which induces a chiral edge state that carries a hall conductance of @xmath9 , giving rise to qah effect . by tuning the fermi level of the sample into the magnetically induced gap",

    "we review the basic mechanism of the qah effect in magnetic tis .      as a starting point , we cam consider a generic two - band hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14 identity matrix , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) are pauli matrices , and @xmath17 , \\\\",
    "m(\\mathbf{k})&=&m - b(k_x^2+k_y^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this two band model alone describes a tr symmetry - breaking system @xcite .",
    "the system is an insulator with a quantized hall conductance provided there is a gap between the two bands @xcite .",
    "the value of the hall conductance is given by the first chern number defined in the brillouin zone , which can be written as @xmath18 for the generic two band model in eq .",
    "( [ 2bandmodel ] ) .",
    "it has the topological meaning @xmath9 times the winding number of the skyrmion pattern of the unit vector @xmath19 around the unit sphere . for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the winding number equals to 1 and 0 , respectively .",
    "the system behaves like an ordinary qh insulator , with a chiral edge state that contributes to the hall conductance @xmath9 .",
    "such a model describes the qah effect realized with both strong spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 terms ) and ferromagnetic polarization ( @xmath24 term ) .",
    "the basic mechanism here is to realize the spin polarized band inversion ( @xmath20 ) in 2d .    to realize spin polarized band inversion in 2d , one can break tr symmetry in the qsh system , where the bands are already inverted .",
    "the qsh system is described by @xmath25 due to tr symmetry , the upper and lower @xmath26 blocks carry the opposite winding numbers , and thus the edge states are helical and the total hall conductance vanishes .",
    "a qsh insulator can therefore be understood as two qahs which are tr partners . when the tr symmetry is broken",
    ", the helical edge states no longer propagate symmetrically , and the hall conductance will become nonzero .",
    "in particular , if we consider the two blocks to have different masses @xmath27 ( which breaks the tr symmetry ) so that one block has @xmath21 and the other block has @xmath20 , the whole system will become a qah state with hall conductance quantized to @xmath9 . in the experiment , this can be realized by introducing an exchange coupling with magnetic impurities .",
    "generically , the spin splitting term induced by the magnetization of magnetic impurities takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the splitting of bands 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "this term effectively changes the mass term @xmath27 of the upper block to @xmath31 , and that of the lower block to @xmath32 .",
    "provided @xmath33 , the masses of the two blocks are different from each other , and the realization of qah is possible . in the model considered here , the qah can be realized if @xmath34 , while the system becomes metallic before developing a quantized hall conductance if @xmath35 .",
    "the above discussion of tr breaking can be easily generalized to more realistic models , which serves as a guiding principle for generating a qah insulator from a qsh insulator .",
    "the low energy effective hamiltonian of surface states of a 3d ti with a single dirac cone is @xmath36 where the @xmath37 direction is perpendicular to the surface and @xmath38 is the fermi velocity .",
    "now we consider the fm proximity to the surface state , and the perturbation hamiltonian is @xmath39 .",
    "the total hamiltonian has the spectrum @xmath40 .",
    "thus , only @xmath41 term can open a gap and destabilize the surface states , which is odd under tr . this mass term will induce a half - integer qh conductance , which can be obtained by eq .  ( 5 )",
    "@xmath42 here the @xmath43 vector has a meron configuration and @xmath19 covers half of the unit sphere .    this half - integer quantum hall is unique to the 3d ti surfaces , originating from the nontrivial bulk topology @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the usual integer quantum hall effect , the half - integer quantum hall on the ti surface is not a measurable effect .",
    "this is because in real systems the quantized hall conductance always comes from the edge states , but mathematically the surface of a 3d ti is always a closed two - dimensional manifold that has no edge .",
    "even if the entire ti surface is gapped out by magnetic impurities , the system can not carry a charge hall current due to the lack of an edge .",
    "on the other hand , if the ti is magnetically dopped and forms a ferromagnetic phase , there will be a domain wall of magnetization on the side surface , and thus the hall conductance will jump by @xmath9 across the domain wall according to eq .",
    "( [ halfqh ] ) .",
    "correspondingly , there will be a chiral edge state at the domain wall [ see fig .",
    "this mechanism therefore provides us another way of realizing the qah effect at zero magnetic field .",

    "as discussed , the crucial criteria to realize the qah effect is the spin polarized 2d band inversion .",
    "therefore , the thin film of a ti with fm order is one of most promising materials . here",

    "however , with the reduction of the film thickness , @xmath58 is finite , and to the lowest order in @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 guarantees the system is in the qah state .",

    "except for the metallic phase in the @xmath79 plane with @xmath104 and the phase boundaries , there are three gapped phases .",
    "the chern number of each phase can be determined by its adiabatic connection to the @xmath80 limit .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec2 ] , the key point to realize the qah effect is to introduce a long - range fm order into the ti . in most conventional diluted magnetic semiconductors , the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) mechanism is believed to have induced the long - range fm order , which is the fm coupling between far away magnetic impurities mediated by itinerant electrons .",
    "however , to exhibit the qah effect , the fm needs to be present also in the insulating regime .",
    "there are two possible mechanism , surface electron mediated rkky interaction  @xcite and bulk electron mediated van vleck paramagnetism  @xcite .",

    "the surface electron mediated rkky interaction between impurities can be obtained by integrating out the fermions in the hamiltonians ( [ surfaceh ] ) and ( [ exchange ] ) , which results in the form for any two magnetic impurities @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 @xmath113 is a function of @xmath114 .",
    "when the surface state has a finite fermi wave vector @xmath115 as is the case in a conventional fermi liquid , the sign of the rkky interaction between the impurity spins oscillates with fermi wavelength @xmath116 . if the fermi level is around the dirac point so that @xmath117 , the rkky interaction does not change sign , as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "the sign of the resulting nearly uniform spin - spin interaction is determined by a second order perturbation calculation , which is generally fm .",
    "it is easy to understand such a fm interaction instead of an antiferromagnetic interaction physically , since a uniform spin polarization opens up a maximal gap on the surface and minimizes the total kinetic energy .",

    "reproduced with permission from  @xcite.,width=288 ]      besides the surface electron mediated rkky interaction , the magnetic exchange coupling between local moments can also be mediated by insulating bulk electrons through van vleck paramagnetism . in order to have a nonzero fm transition temperature , a sizable electron spin susceptibility @xmath122 is needed  @xcite . however , in most dilute magnetic semiconductors , for example , ( ga@xmath5mn@xmath4)as , the electron spin susceptibility is negligible for the insulator phase .    for temperatures much less than the band gap , the spin susceptibility for a band insulator can be obtained by the second order perturbation on the ground state , which can be written as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the vacuum permeability , @xmath125 is the bohr magneton , @xmath126 is the fermi energy , @xmath127 is the spin operator of electron , @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the bloch functions in conduction and valence bands respectively . in order to have a sizable @xmath122 ,",
