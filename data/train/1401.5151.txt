    ", we hereafter assume that @xmath9 is known exactly .",
    "then , a major problem is to design a computationally efficient scheme for recovering @xmath8 from @xmath7 accurately .",
    "a standard approach for this is to follow the least - square principle ; minimizing @xmath10 in conjunction with appropriate @xmath11-regularization terms with respect to @xmath8 yields a signal recovery scheme that performs with a low computational cost using operations of linear algebra .",
    "unfortunately , the optimality of inference accuracy is not guaranteed for the resulting scheme unless @xmath8 follows a distribution of a specific class . in recent years , significant attention has been paid to the usage of the @xmath12-norm regularization when @xmath8 is supposed to be a sparse signal .",
    "the @xmath12-based recovery is capable of recovering sparse signals with a computational cost of the polynomial order of @xmath0 .",
    "however , this still does not achieve the optimal accuracy in general @xcite , whereas perfect recovery is possible for the noiseless case if the observation ratio @xmath13 is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "when the prior distribution of @xmath8 and the distribution of the observation noise @xmath14 are known , the bayesian framework offers an optimal recovery scheme in minimum mean square error ( mmse ) sense although its exact execution is computationally difficult in most cases .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop a computationally feasible approximate scheme for the bayesian signal recovery for a class of random observation matrix @xmath9 . for this",
    ", we employ an advanced mean field method known as _ expectation consistent _ ( ec ) approximation developed in statistical mechanics @xcite and machine learning @xcite .",
    "the developed scheme exhibits consistency with the replica theory , which is supposed to provide exact predictions in the large system limit .",
    "reference @xcite used the replica method to find a decoupled formulation for the input - output statistics of a cs system whose measurement matrix is composed of independently and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) entries . as a corollary",
    ", this leads to a computationally feasible characterization of the mmse as well .",
    "the mmse of a similar i.i.d .",
    "setup was later evaluated directly in @xcite by using mathematically rigorous methods .",
    "numerical results therein verified the accuracy of the earlier replica analysis . finally , non - i.i.d . sensing matrices where considered in @xcite , where the replica method was used to find the support recovery performance of a class of cs systems .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , computationally feasible algorithms approximately performing the bayesian recovery were initially developed for a simple perceptron ( linear classifier ) @xcite and later for cdma @xcite .",
    "recently , a similar idea was applied for cs @xcite as _ approximate message passing _ ( amp ) , and was summarized as a general formulation termed _ generalized approximate message passing _ ( gamp ) @xcite . however , these studies rely on the assumption that each entry of @xmath9 , @xmath15 , is i.i.d . , and the appropriateness for the employment to other ensembles is not guaranteed .",
    "in fact , the necessity for considering a certain characteristic feature of @xmath9 in constructing the approximation was pointed out in @xcite , and its significance was tested for the simple perceptron @xcite , cdma @xcite , and mimo @xcite . here ,",
    "we show how this approach is employed for the signal recovery of linear observations and examine its significance for an example of cs .",
    "in the following , we suppose that each entry of @xmath8 , @xmath16 @xmath17 , is generated from a distribution @xmath18 independently of one another . for simplicity , we focus on the case where the observation noise @xmath14 obeys a memoryless zero mean gaussian distribution , so that the conditional distribution of @xmath7 given @xmath8 is provided as @xmath19 general treatment that includes the case of non - gaussian noise can be found in @xcite .",
    "further , we assume that for eigenvalue decomposition @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the right eigenbasis of @xmath9 and @xmath22 is the diagonal matrix composed of eigenvalues @xmath23 of @xmath24 , @xmath21 can be regarded as a random sample from the uniform distribution of @xmath25 orthogonal matrices and @xmath26 asymptotically converges to a certain distribution @xmath27 with a probability of unity as @xmath28 .",
    "this assumption holds when @xmath15 s are generated independently of one another from a zero mean gaussian distribution .",
    "further , this is also the case when @xmath9 is constructed by randomly selecting @xmath2 rows from a randomly generated @xmath25 orthogonal matrix .",
    "let @xmath29 be an arbitrary recovery scheme given @xmath7 . under the above assumption ,",
    "the mean square error @xmath30 is minimized by the bayesian recovery @xmath31 which achieves the minimum value of @xmath32 ( mmse ) as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 denote averages with respect to the prior and posterior distributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .    although optimality of ( [ bayes_recovery ] ) is guaranteed , evaluating the mmse is generally difficult .",
    "the replica method from statistical mechanics enables the evaluation for the large system limit @xmath40 keeping @xmath41 although its mathematical validity is still open . for generality ,",
    "let us suppose that the true prior and the variance of gaussian noise , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , may be different from @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . the replica symmetric ( rs ) computation @xcite evaluates the performance of the bayesian recovery as follows .",
    "the rs evaluation offers the typical value of @xmath46 as @xmath47 here , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined by extremizing the variational free energy density @xmath51 ,   \\label{replica_free_entropy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 stands for the gaussian measure .",
    "@xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the extremization with respect to @xmath55 , means the asymptotic form of the single rank harish - chandra - itykson - zuber integral of @xmath56 @xcite , which is linked to the @xmath57-transform @xcite as @xmath58 .",

    "it is strongly conjectured that solutions of this type are always thermodynamically dominant offering exact ( but not rigorous ) predictions in the large system limit @xcite .",

    "the hessian of @xmath67 is evaluated as @xmath75 .",
    "however , ( [ firstderivative ] ) indicates that @xmath76 coincides with the covariance of @xmath16 and @xmath77 evaluated by @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , both matrices @xmath79 and @xmath80 are positive definite .",
    "this means that @xmath67 is a convex downward function and has a unique minimum point .",

    "one could exceptionally evaluate @xmath81 with a low computational cost if @xmath82 were a factorized distribution as @xmath83 .",

    "this means that the functional form to be optimized for computing the bayesian recovery varies depending on the employed matrix ensemble .",
    "for instance , @xmath125 should be used for the i.i.d .",
    "gaussian ensemble , which reduces ( [ ec ] ) to ( [ gaussianiid ] ) .",
    "however , when @xmath9 is constructed by randomly selecting @xmath2 rows from a randomly generated @xmath126 orthogonal matrix ( row - orthogonal ensemble ) , the proper function to be employed is given by @xmath127 .",
    "this implies that the employment of amp ( in general , gamp ) , the fixed point of which asymptotically extremizes ( [ gaussianiid ] ) , for generic matrix ensembles may not be a theoretically appropriate treatment even if it leads to a satisfiable approximation accuracy @xcite .",
    "second , although we imposed the consistency of the second moment in a macroscopic manner , one can construct a more accurate approximation by achieving the consistency in a component wise manner as for @xmath128 .",
    "such an approximation was once tested for cdma demodulation @xcite ; however , it incurs @xmath129 computational costs and is difficult to use for large systems .      following the argument of @xcite",
