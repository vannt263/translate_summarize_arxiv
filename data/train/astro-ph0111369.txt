    "the standard model for powerful jets associated with extragalactic radio sources @xcite assumes that the energy radiated in the radio lobes of such sources is produced in the active nuclei of their host galaxies , the central engine being a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disc .",
    "the accretion process fuels a couple of twin supersonic jets which transport away bulk kinetic energy from the neighbourhood of the central black hole to the lobes , from scales of the schwarzschild radius of the supermassive black hole @xmath1 cm , to kiloparsec scales .",
    "this bulk kinetic energy is dissipated by shocks within the beam and ( mostly ) at the jet terminal shocks where electrons are accelerated and radiate via synchrotron and inverse compton mechanisms .",
    "typical lifetimes and kinetic powers of powerful radio sources are @xmath2y and @xmath3erg s@xmath4 , respectively @xcite .    among the problems that still remain open even after more than 30 years of research is the composition of extragalactic jets .",
    "within the standard model @xcite jets are made of a relativistic plasma that contains relativistic electrons and thermal protons ( @xmath5-plasma ) .",
    "on the other side , based on equipartition arguments kundt & gopal - krishna claim that extragalactic jets consist of beams of extremely relativistic electrons and positrons ( @xmath6-plasma ) with almost no ions .",
    "ultimately , the composition of jets is tightly related to their formation mechanisms . as discussed by celotti & blandford ,",
    "electromagnetically dominated outflows , as those generated by the extraction of spin energy of the black hole , will become pair dominated jets with a low baryonic pollution .",
    "jets generated from the accretion disk by hydromagnetic winds will be made of baryonic plasma .",
    "probably , both processes are operating simultaneously in nature .",
    "sol , pelletier & asseo propose a _ two - flow _ model where the jet consists of a beam of relativistic particles ( pair plasma ) surrounded by a newtonian or mildly relativistic ( @xmath5-plasma ) wind accelerated from the disk .",
    "it is also possible that @xmath5-jets become pair - loaded later on , by interactions with high energy photons from the disk corona ",
    "begelman , blandford & rees  or by proton - proton collisions at parsec scale  anyakoha , okeke & okoye .",
    "observations show that a number of jets are highly polarised .",
    "this is a further argument in favour of jets made of e@xmath7 pairs as there is no internal faraday rotation or depolarisation ( the rotation produced by the electrons is compensated by that of the positrons ) , while an @xmath5-plasma gives rise to these effects .",
    "if jets were dominated by @xmath5-plasmas , observational limits on the degree of faraday rotation and depolarisation imply thermal electron densities @xmath8@xmath9  walker , benson & unwin  or a minimum energy cut - off for the electrons @xmath10mev @xcite .",
    "this suggests a lack of thermal ( cold ) matter , at least , in the most polarised sources .",
    "however , as the upper bounds on the thermal electron density derived from the depolarisation argument depend on the magnetic field structure , they might be underestimated if there are field reversals within the vlbi beam .",
    "finally , the detection of circular polarisation at parsec scales in several radio sources @xcite suggests that , in general , extragalactic radio sources are mainly composed of @xmath6-plasma . the argument is based on the fact that circular polarisation is produced by faraday conversion , which requires that the energy distribution of the jet emitting particles extends to very low energies .",
    "this in turn indicates that @xmath6-pairs are an important component of the jet plasma .",
    "sikora & madejski conclude that x - ray observations of blazars associated with ovv quasars impose strong constraints on the e@xmath7 pair content of jets of radio - loud quasars . according to these authors ,",
    "pure electron - positron pair jets can be excluded because they may produce too much soft x - rays , while pure electron - proton jets may emit too few non - thermal x - ray radiation .",
    "therefore , only jets may be viable where the number density of electron - positron pairs is much larger than the proton number density , but small enough for protons still being dynamically more important .",
    "hirotani find that parsec - scale jets can not be dominated by baryons , if the electron density determined by the amount of synchrotron self - absorption necessary for an optically thick jet component , is of the same order as the one derived from the kinetic luminosity .    for jets composed of a pair plasma",
    "additional questions arise . how can they maintain their stability , as for a given particle density they are lighter and hence less stable than jets made of an electron - proton plasma",
    "can they transport enough energy to fuel the observed kiloparsec scale radio lobes ? concerning the stability of electron - positron plasma flows , sol",
    "demonstrate that the _ two - flow _ model is stable against excitation of electrostatic waves as long as the magnetic field is larger than a critical value @xmath11 . in their _ two - flow _",
    "model , the relativistic beam is responsible for the vlbi jet and the observed superluminal motion , while the slower wind gives rise to the kiloparsec scale jet .",
    "achatz & schlickeiser also consider the stability of @xmath6-plasmas against the excitation of electromagnetic waves when the magnetic field exceeds @xmath11 .",
    "they find that the plasma may be stable over large distances provided plasma waves are damped thermally .",
    "the problem of the energy supply to large scales with a limited number of particles is turned around by celotti .",
    "she argues that the jets of low power radio sources mainly consist of @xmath6-plasma , while those of powerful radio - loud quasars are made of @xmath5-plasma .",
    "however , measurements of the circular polarisation of vlba - jets of several frii sources by wardle favour @xmath6-jets also in powerful sources ( at least , at parsec scales ) .",
    "another important and not yet solved question concerns the impact of the composition on the morphology and dynamics of jets from sub - parsec to kiloparsec scales .",
    "observations indicate that jets are relativistic at parsec scales  laing  , then decelerate until they become sub - relativistic or mildly relativistic ",
    "bridle  at kiloparsec scales with advance speeds of the terminal hotspots in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the speed of light . at large scales",
    "the observed morphologies and deceleration of powerful radio sources is governed by interaction with the external medium .",
    "several theoretical models have considered the gross features of kiloparsec scale jets , their long term evolution .",
    "begelman & cioffi ",
    "bc89 hereafter  consider a simple model to describe the evolution of the cocoon .",
    "self - similar expansion is suggested by falle .",
    "komissarov & falle explore the large - scale flow caused by classical and relativistic jets in a uniform external medium .",
    "they find that jets with finite initial opening angles are recollimated by the high pressure in the cocoon and that the flow becomes approximately self - similar at large times .",
    "numerical investigations have also addressed the kiloparsec scale regime .",
    "two - dimensional newtonian hydrodynamic simulations of axisymmetric light jets were performed by cioffi & blondin in order to understand the evolution of the cocoon , and were compared with the simple analytic theory of bc89 .",
    "the grid resolution is quite high ( 15 zones per jet radius ) , but the simulations do only cover a relatively short period of the cocoon s evolution .",
    "the newtonian simulations of hooda , mangalam & wiita cover the evolution of axisymmetric extragalactic jets up to @xmath15y .",
    "their simulations include isothermal atmospheres with a density stratification given by a power - law , surrounded by an even hotter , but less dense intra - cluster medium where the jets accelerate and collimate .",
    "hooda & wiita extended the results of hooda to three - dimensions , but their simulations cover only a distance of 35 ( initial ) jet radii , and thus are too short to shed light on the long term evolution of real sources .",
    "mart , mller & ibez ( 1998 ) ",
    "mmi98 hereafter  studied the long term evolution of powerful extragalactic jets on the basis of relativistic hydrodynamic simulations ( up to an evolutionary time of @xmath16y with a relatively low numerical resolution ) .",
    "the results are compared and interpreted with a simple generalisation of the model of bc89 .",
    "they find an evolution divided into two epochs . after a transient initial stage ,",
    "the jet s evolution is dominated by a strong deceleration .",
    "the jet advance speed becomes as small as @xmath17 due to the degradation of the beam flow by means of internal shocks and the broadening of the beam cross section near the hotspot .",
    "the present work extends the investigations of mmi98 to much later evolutionary times and also addresses the question whether the content of thermal matter in powerful kiloparsec jets does influence their morphology , dynamics and emission properties .",
    "like mmi98 we assume that the dynamics of the jets is dominated by the thermal plasma  sikora & madejski  and , thus , a hydrodynamic approach is appropriate . for this purpose",
    "we have performed long - term simulations of axisymmetric , relativistic jets of extremely different composition , jets made of a pure leptonic or baryonic plasma , propagating into a uniform environment .",
    "in almost all previous jet simulations an ideal gas equation of state ( eos ) with constant adiabatic index @xmath18 has been used .",
    "this is a good approximation in both the nonrelativistic ( @xmath19 ) and the ultra - relativistic limit ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , when there exist very large temperature gradients in the flow , it is more accurate to use a eos including a temperature dependent @xmath18 . for the simulations that we present below temperatures range from about @xmath21k in the ambient medium to @xmath22k in the hotspots .",
    "thus , both relativistic and nonrelativistic particles will participate on an equal footing . additionally , extragalactic jets are likely composed of a mixture of particles of different masses , the value of @xmath18 depends on the composition as protons become relativistic at higher temperatures than electrons .",
    "an equation of state that describes a mixture of ideal , relativistic boltzmann gases has been derived by synge ( see also komissarov & falle 1998 , appendix a ) .",
    "the synge eos used in our simulations includes protons , electrons and positrons .",
    "the composition of the plasma only changes due to fluid mixing as the production or annihilation of electron - positron pairs can be neglected due to the low gas density in the kiloparsec scale ( see , ghisellini 1992 ) . assuming plasma neutrality , only one parameter is needed to fix the composition , the mass fraction of the leptons @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the local rest - mass densities of electrons and positrons , respectively . using the synge eos instead of",
    "a constant-@xmath18 eos requires about 50% more computation time , because the iterative ( newton - raphson ) computation of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 being the specific internal energy ) involves bessel functions .",
    "the following notation holds throughout the paper .",
    "subscripts @xmath28 and @xmath29 refer to the beam and the external medium , respectively .",
    "the speed of light is set to @xmath30 .    assuming a uniform and static external medium a relativistic jet is fully described specifying , at a given inlet of radius @xmath31 , the density contrast @xmath32 between the beam and the ambient medium , the pressure ratio @xmath33 between the beam and the ambient gas , the beam speed @xmath34 or equivalently the beam lorentz factor @xmath35 , the beam mach number @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the beam sound speed ) , and parameters that depend on the eos . for an ideal gas eos only the adiabatic index @xmath18 needs to be specified . in this case , a relativistic jet is freely scalable in size and density , but not in velocity due to the scale introduced by the speed of light . using the synge eos (  [ subsec : eos ] ) @xmath18",
    "is replaced by two parameters describing the chemical composition in the jet and in the external medium , the lepton mass fractions @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the synge eos also introduces an extra mass scale ( due to the electron and proton masses ) , and hence an additional ( mass ) parameter , @xmath40 . with this set of parameters",

    "the kinetic luminosity @xmath46 of a typical fr ii jet is @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the initial jet propagation speed can be restricted by observations of csos ( compact source object ) which have linear sizes of less than 0.5kpc and which most likely represent a very early evolutionary stage of a typical powerful radio source .",
    "observed values of the hotspot propagation velocity are @xmath48 @xcite",

    "values of @xmath52 can be inferred from observations of kiloparsec scale jets .",
    "but @xmath31 is also constraint through other model parameters ( see below ) .",
    "there are also observational constraints on the likely value of the beam lorentz factor at parsec scale - @xmath53 , ghisellini . furthermore , measurements of the degree of polarisation as a function of frequency may be used to set an upper limit on the mean thermal electron density number which is @xmath54@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we have fixed the values of @xmath46 , @xmath39 , @xmath44 , @xmath55 and the initial propagation speed in all our models .",
    "the latter is set equal to @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "this is the propagation velocity derived by mart for a pressure matched jet that moves in one dimension only ( without sideways expansion ) .",
    "if the jet is not pressure matched , the propagation velocity can still be computed using the previous formula as long as the sound speed in the external medium fulfils @xmath58 .",
    "the density contrast @xmath32 and the composition of the beam ( @xmath38 ) are not directly accessible to observations , these quantities are treated as free parameters .",
    "the beam lorentz factor @xmath59 can not be chosen arbitrarily , because there are _ forbidden _ areas in the parameter space where the pressure ratio @xmath60 and , most importantly , the beam temperature @xmath61 have unrealistic values ( see below ) .",

    "@xmath46 is obtained integrating the energy flux ( see , mart 1997 , eq.20 ) over the beam cross section @xmath63 this differs from the definition that other authors have used in the past  see ghisellini  by the factor @xmath64 which accounts for the fact that we do not include the rest - mass energy in the energy density , as it can not be extracted from the beam particles .",
    "having fixed @xmath46 , @xmath65 , @xmath38 and the external medium , the values of @xmath32 , @xmath61 and @xmath66 are uniquely determined by @xmath59 and @xmath31 through relations ( [ equ : v1d ] ) and ( [ equ : lkin ] ) . to clarify this point ,",

    "for @xmath61 there exists no closed form , instead we have the relation : @xmath70 from @xmath61 and the eos one can compute @xmath37 and thus the mach number @xmath66 . figure [ fig : pspace1 ] shows the dependence of @xmath61 and @xmath32 on @xmath59 and @xmath31 in the case of leptonic jets . for large values of @xmath59",
    "there is only a small range of values of @xmath31 around @xmath71kpc where solutions exist .",
    "in fact , the asymptotic value of the beam radius @xmath72 is obtained when @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "computing @xmath31 from ( [ eqn : rb ] ) using the independently measured values of @xmath46 , @xmath65 and @xmath44 from observations yields @xmath75 , which is in agreement with standard values for kpc scale jets ( ferrari 1998 ) . fixing the values of @xmath65 and @xmath46 , and for a constant large @xmath59 ( @xmath76 )",
    ", it turns out that @xmath77 and @xmath78 the latter equation implies that for a given value of @xmath59 , @xmath32 must increase with increasing @xmath31 . as @xmath79",
    "this means @xmath80 and thus @xmath61 must decrease .",
    "eventually , if @xmath31 increases , @xmath61 becomes negative .",
    "this explains the physically forbidden area to the right of @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pspace1 ] .",
    "a similar argument holds for the forbidden area to the left : decreasing @xmath31 eventually leads to non - physical solutions with @xmath82 .",

    "this maximum @xmath59 grows increasing the value of @xmath83 .",
    "let us also point out that from eq .",
    "( [ equ : c2 ] ) , increasing values of @xmath84 lead to larger values of @xmath31 ( notice the quadratic dependence ) .",
    "hence , although there exits no solution with the seemingly reasonable values @xmath85 ,",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath75 ( for the chosen parameters of the external medium , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 ) , one can obtain models with these characteristics by increasing @xmath83 and @xmath84 up to 0.24 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "slightly smaller values of @xmath59 have been chosen to keep our parameters the closest possible to the observed values .",
    "most of the previous jet simulations assumed that the jets are pressure matched ( @xmath88 ) , because ( i ) there are no direct measurements of @xmath60 , and ( ii ) this reduces the parameter space .",
    "however , fixing @xmath60 implies that the properties of the external medium depend on the choice of the jet parameters .",
    "therefore , one has to adjust the temperature of the external medium of every jet model such that @xmath88 . as we wanted to simulate typical frii - jets in a typical environment , the properties of the external medium are fixed and the assumption @xmath88 is abandoned . for @xmath89 jets can still remain stable , because they are pressure confined by the cocoon , where the pressure is much larger than in the external medium . in the simulated models",
    "@xmath60 is in the range @xmath90 .",
    "under - pressured jets ( @xmath91 ) cause considerable numerical problems when they are evolved beyond @xmath92y , because the amount of ambient gas entrained into the beam becomes large .",
    "as the beams of our models are under - dense with respect to the external medium , dense blobs of matter from the ambient medium begin to pile up in front of the nozzle blocking the inflow . as we assume axisymmetry the material piles up around the jet axis .",
    "the simulations are performed with the relativistic hydrodynamic , high - resolution shock - capturing code of mmi98 .",
    "however , instead of a constant @xmath93-law eos we have used the eos described in sect .",
    "[ subsec : eos ] .",
    "the code is well suited to solve the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics in cylindrical coordinates , for problems with axial symmetry .",
    "it has been extensively tested and applied previously ( , mart 1995 , 1997 , mmi98 ) . covering a time span of up to @xmath94y",
    "the set of models represent the longest simulations of relativistic jets performed so far .",
    "we have considered three models ( table [ tab : models ] ) including two leptonic ( @xmath95 ) ones and one baryonic model ( @xmath96 ; bc ) .",
    "one of the leptonic models has a factor of 100 lower density @xmath97 ( lh ) than the other two models with @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding number densities of thermal electrons in the beam are @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "note that both values are below the upper limit estimated from measurements of the degree of polarisation ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : param ] ) .",
    "the low @xmath32 leptonic model has been run in order to check how extremely low values of @xmath32 affect the long term evolution of a relativistic jet ( see , birkinshaw 1991 ; ferrari 1998 ) .",
    "all models have the same power and initial propagation velocity , and they all propagate into the same homogeneous external medium with @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 . as the jet power is fixed , the lower the density the higher is the internal energy , the light jet is also the hottest ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "note also that although the values of the injection temperatures ( table [ tab : models ] ) seem to be rather large , they are unanimously determined once the fiducial conditions in the external medium , @xmath46 , @xmath65 and @xmath38 have been fixed .",
    "we have not considered a light baryonic model ( the counterpart of the light leptonic model ) for three reasons .",
    "first , the temperatures within the beam and in some parts of the cocoon would reach @xmath104k .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the model would be very similar to that of the hot leptonic model , radiation dominated .",
    "second , at temperatures of @xmath104k ( lorentz factors of @xmath105 ) leptons of the thermal plasma will contribute significantly to the synchrotron radiation power .",
    "assuming an equipartition magnetic field ( @xmath106gauss for our simulations ; see sect.[subsec : observations ] ) , the synchrotron cooling time is @xmath107y .",
    "this time is much smaller than the typical lifetime of the source , one has to consider synchrotron cooling in the simulations .",
    "third , the light baryonic model is too hot .",
    "its hot thermal plasma would have a detectable emissivity which is not observed in real sources , so far ( see , celotti 1998 ) .    .parameters of the three simulated jet models . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have extracted the parameter @xmath108 and the exponential dependence of @xmath109 and @xmath110 from our simulation results by fitting the position of the bow shock as a function of time with a power law ( tab.[tab : exponents ] ) . using the fitted values of @xmath108",
    "we have also computed the exponents for @xmath111 and @xmath112 according to the extended bc89 model .",
    "the fitting procedure is not very reliable for the 1d epoch as it involves only a few data points , while velocity fluctuations cause problems for fitting the 2d epoch .",
    "thus , differences between the models are probably not significant .",
    "note in this respect that although the value of @xmath108 varies by a factor of two between the models , the variation of @xmath111 is at most 5% and that of @xmath112 less than 25% as both quantities can be extracted more reliably .",
    "the values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 obtained from the simulations and from @xmath108 via the ebc model agree reasonably well .",
    "the exponent for the aspect ratio is slightly larger than that predicted by the ebc model ( especially for the 1d epoch ) , the radial expansion of the cavity is slower than expected from the deceleration of the jet head .",
    "this discrepancy arises from the assumption of the bc89 model that the whole power of the jet is used to increase the pressure behind the bow shock ( which is responsible for the sideways expansion of the cavity ) .",
    "however , part of the jet power is used to fuel the relativistic backflow and its kinetic energy is not available to expand the cavity in radial direction , the aspect ratio ( jet length over cavity radius ) grows faster in the simulations than in the bc89 model .    during the 2d epoch",
    "the cavity evolution is almost self - similar and the cavity aspect ratio remains nearly constant .",
    "this situation will only change when the cavity pressure becomes equal to the pressure of the external medium and the radial expansion ends .",
    "extrapolating from fig.[fig : logevolution ] this will happen after @xmath113 time units or @xmath114y , which exceeds the estimated ages of observed jets ( @xmath115y  @xmath116y ) by one order of magnitude .    the evolution of the jets proceeds in two epochs independent of the composition of the jet .",
    "this is in agreement with previous results obtained by mmi98 and komissarov & falle .",
    "the 1d epoch of our models corresponds to the intermediate phase of komissarov & falle , while the second epoch may be identified with their self - similar phase .",
    "they also find that the growth rate of the aspect ratio is smaller during the second epoch .",
    "however , their growth rates are slightly larger than ours in both epochs .",
    "this discrepancy is probably due to different jet parameters .",
    "their relativistic models are 30 times denser than ours , have a little bit smaller lorentz factor , are pressure matched , and possess a finite opening angle .",
    "the transition to the second epoch does not occur in those models of komissarov & falle which have an opening angle larger than @xmath117 .",
    "the average jet velocities during the 2d epoch are listed in tab.[tab:1d_vs_2d ] together with the lengths and the cavity aspect ratios at the end of the 1d epoch and at the end of the simulation . at first glance",
    "there seems to be a clear trend in the 1d epoch : with increasing internal energy and decreasing mach number the jets become slower and wider ( the mass flux into the cocoon increases ) . as already found by mmi98 ,",
    "the jet velocities are noticeably larger than predicted by the 1d estimates ( @xmath118 ) at the beginning of the simulation ( see figs.[fig : logevolution]d and [ fig : vevolution ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy is caused by imposing a reflecting boundary condition at @xmath119 ( see sect.[subsec : models ] ) and by the different pressure ratios @xmath60 .",
    "after some ten time units the jet head has propagated far enough from the grid boundary to be no longer affected by it .",
    "the average cavity pressure decreases and the pressure contrast between the jet and the cavity becomes closer to one in all the models ( fig.[fig : logevolution ] ) .",
    "after the jets has decelerated at the end of the 1d epoch their velocities and the 1d estimates agree very well ( fig.[fig : vevolution ] ) .    during the 2d epoch",
    "the jet of model bc propagates considerably faster than those of models lc and lh , while the jet of model lc is only slightly faster than that of model lh .",
    "this result can be easily understood .",
    "the relativistic mach number of model bc is larger , the angle between the conical shocks inside the beam and the beam axis is smaller .",
    "hence , these shocks are less efficient in decelerating the flow .",
    "this also affects the propagation speed of the head , because the terminal mach disk is temporarily replaced by conical shocks an effect pointed out already by mart ( 1997 ) .",
    "the noisy bow shock velocity ( fig.[fig : vevolution ] ) is also a result of this process .",
    "however , as the heads of all jet models are hot and the mach number is low in this region , this effect does not lead to very strong differences between the computed models .",
    "the differences in the cavity aspect ratios correlate with the average propagation speeds .",
    "the jet of model bc is the fastest and the longest one ( tab.[tab:1d_vs_2d ] ) .",
    "the cavity radius is similar for the cold models and bigger for model lh .",
    "the models expand radially almost at the same rate , because the average cavity pressure is essentially equal for all three models although a significant part of the kinetic energy which is contained in the relativistic backflow can not be used to inflate the cavity .",
    "in fact , we included model lh in our investigation in order to check whether an increased fraction of internal ( non - directed ) energy would lead to less kinetic ( directed ) energy in the cocoon .      from a numerical point of view the most important effect of a varying composition",
    "is the non - constant adiabatic index requiring an extension of the original mmi98 code ( see sect.[subsec : models ] ) .",
    "the composition dependent @xmath18 calculated from the synge eos ( see sect.[subsec : eos ] ) however , does not lead to large differences in the evolution and morphology of the jets .",
    "the average @xmath18 in the cocoon is around @xmath120 and @xmath19 in the external medium for all three models . due to the initial conditions , the adiabatic index within the beam is different for every model , but these differences have no observational relevance as @xmath18 is not an observable quantity .",
    "we expected that the largest internal energy content in the leptonic models would cause a larger expansion of the beam than in the baryonic model , leading to a faster deceleration of the head and differences in the aspect ratio of the cavity ( more spherical in the leptonic models ) .",
    "however , this effect is compensated by the large overpressure of the cavity that efficiently confines the jet laterally .",
    "the variation of the particle density with the composition gives rise to huge differences in the temperature . at the same density ,",
    "an @xmath6-gas contains three orders of magnitude more particles than an ionised hydrogen gas .",
    "the particle density is proportional to @xmath121 and , therefore , it is much higher in model lc than in the other two models .",
    "hence , the same amount of energy is distributed over many more beam particles in model lc than in models bc and lh , leading to an about three orders of magnitude lower beam temperature ( fig.[fig : t ] ) . however , this does neither explain the flat temperature profile of model lc , nor the identical average cavity temperatures of models lh and bc ( whose hotspot temperatures differ by a factor of ten ) .",
    "to explain the temperature differences in the cocoon , particles from the external medium must be considered too .",
    "there are @xmath122 particles from the external medium and @xmath123 particles from the beam in the cavity of model lc at @xmath124y .",
    "the dominant fraction of the internal energy of the cavity is also carried by beam particles .",
    "hence , the mixing of beam and external medium has little impact on the internal energy per particle , the temperature remains at the hotspot value .",
    "concerning models lh and bc , particles from the external medium dominate the particle density in the region of the cavity excluding the dense shell behind the bow shock ( _ cavity interior _ ) , @xmath125 , but the internal energy is still dominated by beam particles .",
    "this leads to large changes and fluctuations of the temperature during the mixing of particles from the beam and the external medium ( fig.[fig : t ] ) .",
    "the temperatures near the jet head and near the inlet are very different in these two models .",
    "although the hotspot temperatures differ , the average cocoon temperatures are similar because the same amount of energy is distributed over a similar number of particles . in addition , since the particle density is much lower than in model lc , the average cocoon temperature is much higher .    in general , when @xmath126 the cavity interior has a flat temperature profile and we talk of an _ isothermal _ cavity .",
    "when @xmath127 the average temperature in the cavity interior is heterogeneous and independent of the beam composition and density . in this case",
    "we talk of a _ non - isothermal _ cavity .",
    "another effect is caused by the different time dependencies of @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the number of particles from the external medium in the cavity interior is proportional to its volume , and the cavity interior has a roughly constant density during the whole evolution ( , it changes by less than 20% during @xmath130y in case of model lh ) .",
    "hence , from the ebc model one can derive @xmath131 . while the number of beam particles increases in the cavity interior linearly with time ( @xmath132 ) ,",
    "the ratio @xmath133 decreases , a transition from an isothermal to a non - isothermal cavity may occur during the jet evolution .",
    "figure[fig : nratio ] shows the evolution of @xmath134 for the three models .",
    "model lc has an isothermal cavity throughout the simulation , while the cavities of the other two models are always non - isothermal .",
    "although , we have not found the above mentioned transition , fig.[fig : nratio ] suggests that one should be able to find initial jet parameters ( between those of models lh and lc ) where such a transition will occur during the simulation .    in an isothermal cavity",
    "the external particles can be neglected , @xmath135 . as the cavity volume is proportional to @xmath136 , the number density within the cavity @xmath137 . however , as @xmath138 , this implies that the temperature @xmath139 does not depend on time .",
    "this explains why the cocoon temperature is constant in @xmath140-direction and also in @xmath141-direction ( fig.[fig : t ] ) . in a non - isothermal cavity particles from the external medium dominate , @xmath142 and the average cocoon temperature decreases according to @xmath143 .      comparing the hydrodynamic properties at the end of our simulations with those deduced from observations of cyga",
    ", we find that the hot spot pressure ( @xmath144dyn @xmath145 ) agrees within a factor of 2 with the value reported by carilli .",
    "comparing the hotspot advance speeds of cso and fr ii sources implies a deceleration of the hotspot propagation at early epochs .",
    "this deceleration indeed occurs in our simulations .",
    "the propagation velocity after the deceleration ( @xmath146 ) is in good agreement with the estimates of daly .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field of @xmath147 g in the cavity and @xmath148 g in the hotspot are larger than those reported for cyg  a @xcite , although they agree with the values obtained for the radio lobes and hotspots of younger powerful radio sources @xcite .",
    "this agreement is easily explained considering that the evolutionary time covered by the simulations is relatively short .",
    "up to now it is impossible to determine hydrodynamic properties of jets directly from the observed radio emission .",
    "thus , in order to compare the simulated jets with observed ones we proceed in opposite direction and compute the non - thermal synchrotron radio emission of our hydrodynamic models .",
    "we follow the same approach as in aloy assuming that the energy density weighted with the beam particle fraction is distributed among the emitting non - thermal particles according to a power law @xmath149 ( without cut - offs ) .",
    "the magnetic field is considered to have equipartition strength and a _ ad hoc _ structure : aligned with the flow velocity and with a negligible random component ( because we are not concerned in polarisation properties ) .",
    "the simulated radio maps obtained from the hydrodynamic models ( fig.[fig : radiomap ] ) include only those computational zones where the density is smaller than 0.1@xmath44 to exclude emission from the external medium .",
    "we have chosen a viewing angle of @xmath150 to compute the synthetic radio maps in order to avoid excessive doppler boosting of the beam which would out - shine completely the diffuse emission from the cocoon .",
    "two main features known from observations are present in all models : radio lobes with hotspots and a one - sided , knotty jet ( particularly evident in model lh ) .",
    "the knots are associated with internal shocks in the beam .",
    "emission is dominated by the hotspots , where the pressure is maximum .",
    "figure[fig : radiomap ] shows that the models have different jet / cocoon emission ratios , as expected from their different cocoon morphology ( sect.[subsec : cocoon ] ) .",
    "while models bc and lc show some emission from the cocoon , resembling the observed lobes , the emission is dominated by the beam in model lh .    in actual sources the lobes of the jet and counter - jet",
    "are often observed to be equally prominent .",
    "our simulations show larger lobes ( more cocoon emission ) for the counter - jet ( particularly for models bc and lc ) .",
    "this can be explained by the relativistic backflow present in the simulated models , because doppler boosting enhances the emission from the backflow regions in the counter - jet and dims that of the approaching jet lobe .",
    "the relativistic backflow also limits the radial expansion of the lobes and prevents the beam from inflating large lobes with gas moving at sub - relativistic speeds .",
    "therefore , the similarity of the lobes in actual radio sources suggests that there are no relativistic backflow regions .",
    "their presence in the simulated models is most likely due to the axial symmetry imposed in our 2d simulations .",
    "three dimensional simulations @xcite show much smaller backflow velocities , typically @xmath151 , and hence do not lead to substantial doppler beaming in the counter - jet cocoon .",
    "very recently , the new generation of space - based x - ray observatories has allowed for the detection of x - ray emission from kiloparsec scale jets @xcite .",
    "the observed x - spectra are not satisfactorily explained by standard radiation mechanisms , synchrotron self - compton @xcite and synchrotron radiation .",
    "the latter can arise from the same population of particles that produce the radio emission @xcite , or from a second , much more energetic population of electrons co - spatial with the one responsible for the radio emission @xcite .",
    "alternatively , inverse compton scattering of beamed photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has also been proposed @xcite .",
    "for this mechanism to work , it is necessary that the beam of the jet is , at least , mildly relativistic , because the amplification of the cmb radiation increases with the doppler factor , @xmath152^{-1}$ ] @xcite .",
    "our models show relativistic beam velocities ( @xmath153 ) out to 80 kpc ( see sect.[subsec : beam ] ) . whether this is a result of the imposed axisymmetry of our models or a physical feature",
    "may only be disentangled by performing three - dimensional simulations ( see sect[subsec : caveats ] ) .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung from the gas confining the radio - optical jet was very soon disregarded as the source of the observed x - ray radiation from the jets of powerful sources @xcite , although the data can be fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum @xcite . in order to explain the observations invoking thermal bremsstrahlung , a large electron density ( @xmath154@xmath9 )",
    "is required .",
    "this is , however , inconsistent with the observed ( relatively low ) rotation measure ( @xmath155 ; @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the magnetic field strength and the path length , respectively ; schwarz 2000 ) .",
    "the estimate for the electron number density , is based on the assumption that ( i ) there are no magnetic field reversals within the vla beam , and ( ii ) the confining thermal material is not relativistic and relatively cold .",
    "but , our simulations show the presence of a very hot relativistic plasma ( at least in model bc ) , which is not accurately described by the classical formulas .",
    "given that the densities are very similar in all our models and that there are huge temperature differences inside the cavity ( fig.[fig : t ] ) , we have analysed whether relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung can be used to distinguish between the cavities inflated by jets of different composition .",
    "we follow the work of nozawa , itoh & kohyama , which includes the appropriate elwert factor to compute the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung cross section .",
    "their method is accurate if one can neglect the thermal motion of protons , at temperatures below @xmath158k . for larger temperatures",
    "the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung cross section is still accurate within an order of magnitude ( itoh , private communication ) . above @xmath159k electron - electron , electron - positron , positron - ion , and positron - positron bremsstrahlung processes",
    "are important ( see , novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",
    "these processes should have been included when computing the total bremsstrahlung emissivity of our models , where temperatures are as high as @xmath160k in the shear layer confining the jet , in the hotspot , and in the cocoon of model bc .",
    "however , as the emissivity of these processes is comparable with that produced by the interaction of electrons with protons @xcite , the emissivity of the latter process provides a lower bound of the total bremsstrahlung emissivity , which is accurate to an order of magnitude up to temperatures of @xmath161k .",
    "the bremsstrahlung power @xmath162 per unit of frequency ( @xmath163 ) in the comoving frame is proportional to @xmath164 ( @xmath165 is the number density of ions in the medium ) . considering a viewing angle of @xmath166 ,",
    "beaming effects are unimportant , @xmath162 is dominated in all models at relatively low frequencies ( @xmath167kev ) by the very dense shell at the cavity boundary behind the bow shock containing shocked external medium . although the non - shocked external medium is cooler than the shell , @xmath162 is three orders of magnitude smaller than in the shell , because the shocked material is much denser than the ambient medium .",
    "the bremsstrahlung emission from the cavity s interior is very weak in models bc and lh .",
    "this is different for model lc , where the temperatures in the cocoon are lower and the electron densities are larger than in the other models .",
    "the resulting bremsstrahlung emissivity of the cavity s interior is almost as strong as that of the external medium .",
    "the dominance of the x - ray emission from the shell is also evident from the surface brightness , from the integral of @xmath162 computed along the line of sight ( fig.[fig : bremss_90_bk ] ) .",
    "the total emission x - ray maps of all models look very similar , as the shell outshines the cavity at a frequency of @xmath168kev ( fig.[fig : bremss_90_bk ] top panel ) .",
    "note that our analysis does not take into account the emission of intra - cluster gas , which would be dominant for a radio source located in a galaxy cluster .",
    "the dominance of the shell is in agreement with the work of heinz , reynolds & begelman .",
    "they also find that the shell s dominance decreases as the source evolves because the bow shock decreases in strength when the pressure inside the cavity decreases due to the expansion .",
    "mcnamara find a reduced x - ray surface brightness when observing the radio lobes of hydraa , an effect which is evident in our models .",
    "however , mcnamara also point out that there is no evidence for shock - heated gas surrounding the radio lobes , and hence suggest that the cavity expands subsonically .",
    "this does not contradict our results , as we consider frii sources ( hydraa is a fri source ) and because our models represent a still relatively young evolutionary stage of a powerful radio source .",
    "fri sources reach the transonic regime relatively soon and , therefore , one does not expect to find a strong shock surrounding the radio lobes .",
    "instead the radio lobes flare into the external medium .",
    "this may explain the lack of x - ray emission from the region surrounding the cavity .",
    "on the other hand , it is expected that a further evolution of the source will lead to a decrease of the cavity pressure , and consequently to a weakening of the cavity bow shock ( which in turn reduces the x - ray emission of the shell ) .",
    "we have also computed the surface brightness per unit of frequency at @xmath168mev ( fig.[fig : bremss_90_bk ] bottom panel ) .",
    "we choose this high frequency , which is beyond the observational range of _ chandra _",
    "( @xmath169kev ) , because only when considering hard x - rays one begins to see the emitting fluid inside the cavity and the emission of the model differs most .",
    "increasing the frequency from @xmath168kev to @xmath170kev@xmath171mev the interior of the cavity shows up , although the bow shock surrounding the head of the jet is still dominant . at even higher frequencies ( @xmath172mev ) , the hotspot and the high temperature cocoon are visible .",
    "finally , at @xmath173mev ( bottom panel in fig.[fig : bremss_90_bk ] ) , only models bc and lh show some emission while the exponential cut - off of the bremsstrahlung spectrum reduces the emissivity of model lc , as the temperature of the cavity interior of model lc , @xmath174kev , is much smaller than the considered frequency .",
    "this might provide a way to distinguish observationally  once future detectors have the appropriate dynamical range and sensitivity  leptonic from baryonic jets ( with the same kinetic power and density contrast ) . if one observes a transition from a shell dominated source to a source dominated by the interior of the cavity",
    "when increasing the observation frequency from @xmath175mev to @xmath176mev , the jet feeding the radio lobe is most probably rich in baryons .",
    "conversely , if this transition is not detected and one finds instead a significant suppression of the emission , the jet is mostly made of leptons .",
    "typical luminosities of very powerful x - ray , large - scale jets are of the order @xmath177erg@xmath178sec@xmath4 , chartas report a x - ray luminosity in the @xmath179kev band of @xmath180erg@xmath178sec@xmath4 for pks 0637 - 752 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities produced by our jet models due to thermal bremsstrahlung are far below the observed values .",
    "this rules out thermal bremsstrahlung as the dominant mechanism for the x - ray emission of large - scale jets .",
    "however , several factors may enhance the total thermal luminosity .",
    "first , the size of our jets is still relatively small as compared with fully evolved fr ii sources ( the larger the jet the larger is the luminosity ) .",
    "second , the kinetic power of our models , although being large , is still below the one inferred for pks 0637 - 752 ( @xmath181erg@xmath178sec@xmath4 ; tavecchio 2000 ) .",
    "our simulations show that the jet itself radiates only a small fraction of the total power per unit of frequency emitted by the whole cavity ( @xmath182erg@xmath178sec@xmath4hz@xmath4 for model bc at @xmath168kev ) . at @xmath168mev",
    "the emitted power from the cavity is @xmath183erg@xmath178sec@xmath4hz@xmath4 and is dominated by the hotspot which contributes @xmath184erg@xmath178sec@xmath4hz@xmath4 .      which are the astrophysical and numerical limitations of our simulations ?",
    "we have used a uniform external atmosphere , but extragalactic jets after having crossed a galactic halo will propagate into a much more diffuse intergalactic ( or intra - cluster ) medium . both the pressure and the density decrease with the distance from the galactic nucleus .",
    "a density declining atmosphere will cause a widening of the jet ( and of the cavity ) , and a substantial deceleration provided that the jets are not inertially confined .",
    "the effects of ( continuous or abrupt ) density changes in the external medium and its impact on the long term evolution of newtonian jets has been investigated , by hooda @xcite .",
    "such simulations involve additional , not very well determined model parameters and are more complex making them less attractive from the computational point of view , in particular as our grid resolution ( zones per beam radius ) is much larger than that in hooda .",
    "our simulations are purely hydrodynamic , they do not consider the effects of magnetic fields .",
    "strong magnetic fields might confine the shocked jet material in an extended _ nose cone _ preventing it to be continuously deposited into the cocoon .",
    "an episodic release of thermal material in the cocoon would have important consequences for the stability of the jet .",
    "however , it is quite unlikely that at kiloparsec scales strong magnetic fields do exist .",
    "instead , jets are expected to transport weak and mainly randomly oriented magnetic fields ( ferrari 1998 ) .",
    "the grid resolution employed ( six zones per beam radius at the injection nozzle ) is far from being appropriate to account for phenomena like mass entrainment from the external medium .",
    "however , it is sufficient to describe the gross morphological features and to capture the average cocoon dynamics .",
    "one should consider that , in order to compute up to a maximum physical time , @xmath185 , the required run time is proportional to @xmath186 .",
    "hence , increasing the grid resolution by a factor of two requires about 1200 hours of computing time to reach @xmath187y , and 9600 hours to simulate a typical lifetime of a frii source ( @xmath188y ) . in order to check whether the chosen resolution was sufficient to capture , at least the qualitative morphology",
    ", we performed a set of shorter simulations @xmath189y at different grid resolutions ( fig.[fig : resdep ] ) . with",
    "four zones@xmath190 the short acceleration phases caused by the vortex shedding are missing , while they are present with six zones@xmath190 . at even higher resolution",
    "the qualitative changes are small .",
    "finally , we have restricted ourselves to axisymmetric jet flows .",
    "this is a considerable restriction , because we force the jet to propagate along the symmetry axis .",
    "as , aloy showed , three - dimensional jets may wobble and their effective head area may change appreciably . consequently ,",
    "two possibilities arise : ( i ) the effective area grows ( as the result of , the _ dentist drill effect _ ; cox , gull & scheuer ) leading to a faster deceleration , or ( ii ) the wobbling of the mach disk reduces the cross sectional surface of the jet head leading to an acceleration @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to extrapolate the results of aloy and to decide whether or not such mechanisms operate in the long run , and what their consequences are .",
    "thus , three - dimensional numerical simulations are required to clarify this issue .    because of the assumed axisymmetry we encountered numerical problems when simulating under - pressured jets ( see sect.[subsec : param ] ) .",
    "these problems would not appear in three ",
    "dimensional simulations as the jet fluid will bypass the blobs of external medium material trying to block the inlet .",
    "we have performed the longest and best resolved large - scale simulations of relativistic jets up to date . the simulations",
    "extend up to an evolutionary age of @xmath191y which is only a few times smaller than the ages of typical powerful radio sources .",
    "the simulated jets differ in their density , temperature and composition , but have similar gross properties ( kinetic luminosity and thrust ) .",
    "hence , they may represent a relatively early stage of the observed extragalactic jets and their radio lobes .",
    "we have considered three models including a hot and a cold jet made of a pure ( leptonic ) electron - positron plasma ( models lh and lc ) and one baryonic model bc consisting of an electron - proton plasma .",
    "the leptonic hot model lh has a factor of 100 lower density ( @xmath97 ) than the other two models ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "although there is a difference of about three orders of magnitude in the temperatures of the cavities inflated by the simulated jets , we find that both the morphology and the dynamic behaviour are almost independent on the assumed composition of the jets .",
    "only the leptonic hot model lh behaves differently because of its very light beam .",
    "this reflects the well known influence of the density parameter @xmath32 according to which light jets are less stable than heavy ones .",
    "model lh suffers from considerable mass entrainment into the beam , which eventually leads to the disruption of the beam .",
    "the instability grows on a time scale of a few million years , the evolution of model lh is inconsistent with the sizes and ages of the jets of typical powerful radio sources .",
    "in addition , the initial conditions chosen for model lh are quite extreme , and most likely can not be found in actual jets .    in all models",
    "two evolutionary epochs can be distinguished . during the first epoch",
    "multidimensional effects are not yet important and the jet propagates with a velocity close to the 1d estimate .",
    "the mach disk is only slightly disturbed , the shedding of vortices is negligible , and both the hotspot pressure and the jet velocity are nearly constant . the aspect ratios of the cocoon and of the cavity increase with time , while the average cavity pressure decreases .",
    "the second epoch starts when the first larger vortices are produced near the jet head .",
    "the beam cross section increases and the jet decelerates progressively . the deceleration is repeatedly interrupted by short acceleration phases caused by the temporary replacement of the mach disk by a conical shock . the velocity increase during the acceleration phases can exceed 100% .",
    "the evolution of the cocoon and cavity aspect ratios of all models is in agreement with an extended version of the simple theoretical model proposed by begelmann & cioffi ( bc89 ) for the inflation of the cocoon .",
    "the cavity aspect ratio of the simulated models is too large according to current observations , the simulated jets are too elongated .",
    "this situation may change when the simulations are either extended even further in time or when the assumption of axisymmetry is relaxed .",
    "however , both approaches would require prohibitive amounts of computational resources and axisymmetry is , in general , a good approximation to study extragalactic jets .",
    "the size and shape of the cocoon depends on @xmath32 , on the ratio of the densities in the jet and in the ambient medium .",
    "according to our definition of the cocoon  the region containing material with a beam particle fraction @xmath192  we find that a light jet ( model lh ) has a very thin cocoon restricted to a narrow layer girding the beam .",
    "jets with heavier beams ( models bc and lc ) possess more extended cocoons , more similar to those of observed jets .",
    "the differences in the cocoon sizes become particularly evident when comparing the synthetic radio maps that we have computed for all models .",
    "the cocoon aspect ratio found for the leptonic hot model lh is unrealistically large , which provides another argument against its realization in nature ( see above ) .",
    "the propagation velocities and the hotspot pressures of our jets agree very well with the analytical and observed values .",
    "the strength of the equipartition magnetic field comfortably matches the expectations for a young powerful radio source ( whose magnetic fields are thought to be stronger than those of evolved radio sources ) .",
    "the beam velocities of the models are relativistic ( @xmath0 ) at kiloparsec scales .",
    "provided this is not an artefact caused by the assumed axisymmetry , the results strongly support the ideas of tavecchio and celotti that the x - ray emission of several extragalactic jets may be due to relativistically boosted cmb photons .",
    "the radio emission of all models is dominated by the contribution of the hotspots .",
    "the two cold models ( bc and lc ) have very similar radio - morphologies with a continuous beam connecting the inlet with the hotspot .",
    "this is different from model lh where the synthetic radio maps show a discontinuous and knotty beam even at a viewing angle of @xmath193 ( where the effects of doppler boosting are still small ) .",
    "we find that the thermal bremsstrahlung emission is strongly suppressed at very high energies ( @xmath194mev ) in the leptonic cold model because the average temperature of its cavity ( @xmath195k ) is much lower than that of the two other models ( @xmath196k ) .",
    "the baryonic and the leptonic hot model both show a gradual transition in the characteristics of their thermal bremsstrahlung emission . at low energies",
    "the emission is dominated by the shell , while the interior of the cavity dominates at high energies .",
    "all models exhibit a depression in the x - rays surface brightness of the cavity interior in agreement with recent observations @xcite .",
    "these observations also show a lack of strong x - ray emission from the boundaries of the radio lobes of hydraa .",
    "this does not contradict our results as hydraa is a fri source , while we have been simulating powerful radio sources . in a powerful source",
    "the bow shock is a strong shock and , hence , it may produce substantial x - ray emission .",
    "fri sources flare into the external medium and , most probably , they do not have strong bow shocks .",

    "<S> we study the influence of the matter content of extragalactic jets on their morphology , dynamics and emission properties . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we consider jets of extremely different compositions including pure leptonic and baryonic plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> our work is based on two - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of the long - term evolution of powerful extragalactic jets propagating into a homogeneous environment . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of state used in the simulations accounts for an arbitrary mixture of electrons , protons and electron - positron pairs . using the hydrodynamic models we have also computed synthetic radio maps and the thermal bremsstrahlung x - ray emission from their cavities .    </S>",
    "<S> although there is a difference of about three orders of magnitude in the temperatures of the cavities inflated by the simulated jets , we find that both the morphology and the dynamic behaviour are almost independent on the assumed composition of the jets . </S>",
    "<S> their evolution proceeds in two distinct epochs . during the first one multidimensional effects are unimportant and the jets propagate ballistically . </S>",
    "<S> the second epoch starts when the first larger vortices are produced near the jet head causing the beam cross section to increase and the jet to decelerate . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the cocoon and cavity is in agreement with a simple theoretical model . </S>",
    "<S> the beam velocities are relativistic ( @xmath0 ) at kiloparsec scales supporting the idea that the x - ray emission of several extragalactic jets may be due to relativistically boosted cmb photons . </S>",
    "<S> the radio emission of all models is dominated by the contribution of the hot spots . </S>",
    "<S> all models exhibit a depression in the x - rays surface brightness of the cavity interior in agreement with recent observations .    </S>",
