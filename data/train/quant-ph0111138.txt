    "we should also note that in this case the multiple nash equilibria brings a situation different to that in the transitional regions with @xmath138 .",
    "the two nash equilibria are not equivalent and @xmath111 gives higher payoffs to both players than does @xmath110 .",
    "therefore it is a quite reasonable assumption that the players are most likely to resort to the equilibrium @xmath111 rather than @xmath110 , since they are both trying to maximize their individual payoffs . however , one still can not claim that the players will definitely resort to the equilibrium that gives higher payoffs .",
    "but if they do , the final results of the game will then be the same as in the quantum region with @xmath149 , and the dilemma will be resolved .",
    "an interesting question is that can the game behave full quantum - mechanically no matter how much it is entangled for some particular numerical value of @xmath150 , _ i.e. _ have only the quantum region ( without the presence of classical , transitional or coexistent regions ) .",
