    "the study of metastable states in spin glasses began some 25 years ago with the calculations of tanaka and edwards @xcite ( te ) and of bray and moore @xcite ( bm ) , dealing with metastable states at zero and non - zero temperatures respectively , within the infinite - range sherrington kirkpatrick model .",
    "for the zero - temperature studies , metastable states were defined as states which are one - spin - flip stable , i.e.  states for which flipping any one spin increases the energy , while for @xmath11 they were identified with solutions of the tap equations @xcite , which are exact for the sk model . while the te calculation is quite straightforward",
    ", the original bm calculation involved some technical challenges which were finessed in the first attempt , and have only recently been satisfactorily resolved , some 24 years after the original paper @xcite . while the central result of bm , that the mean number ( averaged over disorder configurations ) of tap solutions increases exponentially with the number of spins , @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the ` complexity ' , was confirmed by the later work , new insights into the nature of the tap solutions and the structure of the free - energy landscape were obtained . specifically , it was found that all solutions correspond either to minima of the tap free energy @xmath14 , or to saddle points of index one , where the index of a saddle point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian matrix @xmath15 , so that minima have index zero .",
    "furthermore , the minima and saddle points occur in close ( in configuration space ) pairs @xcite .",
    "this structure has implications for the dynamics in the sk model .",
    "in particular we will study the free energy difference between the saddle and its associated nearby minimum .",
    "this difference would seem intuitively to be related to the barrier which has to be overcome to escape from a pure state and we will find that it increases with @xmath6 like @xmath16 .",
    "however , for the vast majority of the tap states  all those with free energy per spin larger than its equilibrium value  the barriers are finite .",
    "this means that such tap states are probably of little physical significance for the dynamics of the sk model .",
    "we will contrast the tap free - energy landscape with that of the naive mean - field ( nmf ) equations .",
    "we show numerically that the free - energy function @xmath17 possesses saddle points with large indices @xmath8 ( up to a maximum proportional to @xmath6 ) , and we show that the corresponding landscape is more rugged than the tap landscape and tends to trap the ` iterative ' dynamics at ( or close to ) a threshold free energy where the minima numerically dominate the saddle points , much as in the @xmath18-spin spherical model @xcite .",
    "this qualitative distinction between dynamics on the tap and nmf free energy surfaces is interesting because both sets of equations become _ the same _ at @xmath19 . in particular",
    ", they have the same ground states .",
    "this suggests a program for finding the ground - state energy by working with the tap equations at very low but non - zero temperature , and using the resulting states at starting configurations for a final quench at @xmath19 . in view of the preceding discussion ,",
    "the same approach applied to the nmf equations would not be successful , since the system would get stuck at a threshold free energy , as for the @xmath18-spin spherical model .",
    "if one hopes to determine ground - state properties using @xmath11 equations , therefore , it is important to choose equations with a favorable free - energy surface ( like tap ) rather than an unfavorable one ( like nmf ) . in other words",
    "if one is trying to find low energy states of ( say ) the sk model using standard algorithms such as gradient descent on a free energy surface , then one gets much lower energy solutions if one uses the exact free - energy surface than when one uses only an approximation to it .",
    "we suspect this point will have validity beyond the sk model .",
    "however , we have discovered that it is possible to obtain solutions of low free energy by a method which takes one entirely off the free energy surface .",
    "these states are accessed through a novel iterative algorithm containing one adjustable parameter .",
    "we show that there is a critical value of this parameter separating runs which terminate from those which do not , and that the lowest free - energy states are accessed when the parameter is close to the critical value . as the parameter is increased towards the critical value , one sees many solutions which are limit cycles of a length which also increases as the critical value is approached and beyond the critical value only ` chaotic solutions ' seem to exist . in the course of the iteration it is possible for the magnetizations to take unphysical values such that @xmath20 .",
    "we speculate that this approach may be a generic technique for finding low - cost states in hard optimization problems . somehow being close to the ` edge of chaos '",
    "enables one to explore phase space and it is only the lowest states , which are surrounded by the highest barriers , which can trap the algorithm into a fixed point rather than a limit cycle .",
    "possibly related ideas are in a paper by boettcher and frank @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ section2 ] we state",
    "the tap and nmf equations , discuss the algorithmic methods we will adopt and demonstrate that for nmf most of the standard algorithms seem to terminate at a free energy which is relatively insensitive to the algorithm .",
    "in section [ exhaustive ] , we explain this result by carrying out an exhaustive search for turning points of the free energy for small systems , showing that there is a threshold free energy below which minima numerically dominate saddle points . the connection between the structure of the free - energy landscape and the nature of the dynamical attractors is further explored in section [ connection ] .",
    "section [ sec : tap ] contains a detailed study of low free - energy tap states obtained from studying the solutions using the ` edge of chaos ' algorithm .",
    "section [ discussion ] concludes with a discussion and summary of the main results .",
    "the tap and nmf equations can be derived from the following generalized free - energy function : @xmath21\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 corresponds to tap and @xmath23 to nfm . in eq.([freeenergy ] ) the local magnetizations , @xmath24 , lie in the range @xmath25 , @xmath26 as usual , and @xmath27 .",
    "the tap and nfm equations themselves are derived from the equations @xmath28 , @xmath29 , which give the turning points of @xmath30 .",
    "they can be written in the form @xmath31\\ ] ] where the local field @xmath32 .",
    "the second term in the argument of the @xmath33 function is , for the tap case @xmath22 , the onsager reaction term .",
    "the tap equations are exact as @xmath34 for the sk model .",
    "the naive mean - field equations are exact for the wallace model , in which at each site @xmath35 in the system there is a set of ising spins @xmath36 ( @xmath37 , each of which interacts with the @xmath38 spins at sites which are coupled to the @xmath35-th site and the limit @xmath39 is taken @xcite .",
    "the set of spins @xmath0 that satisfy ( [ turningpoint ] ) can be thought of as a fixed point @xmath40 of the map @xmath41 this map could be applied to all spins in parallel , to each spin separately and in sequence , each time to a random spin , or to a spin chosen for some particular reason .",
    "it turns out that for the nmf equations ( @xmath23 ) , application of this map leads always to a fixed point that coincides with a minimum in the free energy landscape , no matter how the map is applied .",
    "this fact one establishes by calculating , at the fixed point , the hessian @xmath42 which is the matrix of second derivatives of the free energy , @xmath43 \\delta_{ij},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] ( which holds for all @xmath44 if one takes @xmath45 ) and checking that all its eigenvalues are positive , thus defining a minimum . as we will see below",
    ", the free energy landscape also has turning points with a positive number @xmath8 of negative eigenvalues ",
    "we call these saddle points of index @xmath8 . on the other hand the inclusion of onsager reaction term leads to the map ( [ simplemap ] ) almost never converging on a fixed point .",
    "clearly one does not imagine that the trajectory described by iteration of the map ( [ simplemap ] ) corresponds to any reasonable physical dynamics on the free energy landscape , e.g. , a zero - temperature dynamics in which one follows the path of steepest descent to a local ( in general , metastable ) minimum .",
    "unfortunately , numerical algorithms that one might expect to approximate closely a physical dynamics ( such as steepest descents or conjugate gradients ) turn out to be poorly adapted to the nmf free energy landscape .",
    "the reason for this is that the free energy minima tend to lie close to the sides of the hypercube @xmath46 over which the free energy is defined .",
    "naively , one might imagine that the divergence in the free energy gradient as the hypercube s boundary is approached would prevent a descent algorithm from exiting the physical region .",
    "however , the weak and short - ranged logarithmic divergence is not resolved numerically .",
    "this can cause points to be reached that lie outside the hypercube and for which the free energy ( [ freeenergy ] ) is undefined , thereby creating an obvious numerical problem .",
    "we tried a number of modifications here to work around this , such as mapping the bounded hypercube to an infinite domain , or inventing a ficticious free energy outside the hypercube , all to no avail .    for this reason",
    ", we modified instead the iterative map ( [ simplemap ] ) in a way that we believe gives some insight into the free energy minima located by a physical dynamics .",
    "this map reads @xmath47\\ ] ] in which @xmath48 is a parameter that controls the speed of approach to the next iterate .",
    "we describe the utility of this more general iterative scheme first in the context of the nmf equations ( @xmath23 ) and then the tap equations ( @xmath22 ) .      if in eq .",
    "( [ bettermap ] ) the parameter @xmath48 is small , one expects a smooth trajectory to be followed , and crucially one that is constrained to remain within the hypercube .",
    "this statement can be made more precise by noting that the displacement @xmath49 is bounded : @xmath50 and so can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , one can show that the projection of this displacement onto the gradient vector of the free energy is always negative .",
    "thus , for sufficiently small @xmath48 , the dynamics should take a small step in such a way as to lower the free energy , a fact that has been verified numerically .",
    "although we do not claim that this dynamics is equivalent in any sense to a steepest - descent dynamics , the fact that the free energy is lowered in a controlled fashion leads us to view it as a ` physical ' dynamics .    in table",
    "[ nmfalgorithms ] we display the free energy of the nmf minima located using four different algorithms , averaged over both a number of different realizations of the disorder ( i.e. , sets of the random variables @xmath51 , each of which we refer to as a _ sample _ ) and over a number of different initial conditions on the iteration . so that the algorithms can be properly compared for a given system size @xmath6 , each was treated to the same set of samples .",
    "the system sizes used were quite small ( @xmath52 ) so that we may later compare with the exhaustive search for _ all _ turning points in the same samples ( see section  [ exhaustive ] ) .",
    "the first three of the four algorithms are implementations of ( [ simplemap ] ) applied on a spin - by - spin basis in different ways . in the _ random _ algorithm ,",
    "the spin chosen for update is chosen at random , whereas in the _ cyclic _ algorithm , each is visited in order .",
    "the spin chosen in the _ greedy _ algorithm is that for which the free energy will decrease the most under application of the map .",
    "finally the _ physical _ algorithm uses ( [ bettermap ] ) applied _ simultaneously _ to all spins and with the control parameter @xmath53 .",
    "we notice from the table that the differences in the free energy arising from a change of algorithm , whilst significant compared to the errors , are about two orders of magnitude smaller than those arising from an increase in the system size .",
    "later , we will provide evidence that these changes are also small on the scale of free energies spanned by all the solutions of the nmf equations .",

    "when @xmath48 is tuned towards 1 , more and more weight is taken from the finite limit cycles and transferred to the infinite one , until at @xmath57 all cycles have infinite length . at the same time , decreasing @xmath48 towards the value one leads to states with ever lower free energies .",
    "the optimum results for the free energy ( giving the equilibrium free energy per spin in the thermodynamic limit ) seemingly occur when the system is ` at the edge of chaos ' .",

    "[ freescale ] suggests that by tuning @xmath48 towards @xmath60 solutions of arbitrarily low free energy can in principle be found , we will now show that in practice this becomes increasingly difficult for large system sizes .",

    "[ barrierscale ] shows a scaling plot of the barrier heights using the same scaling variable as in fig.[freescale ] .",
    "the data collapse is not very good , but is consistent with a barrier height exponent @xmath70 , which is the expected scaling for the sk model @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the barriers between very low - lying mimima and their corresponding saddles , with free energies per spin equal to the equilibrium value , scale as @xmath16 for large @xmath6 , but with a rather small coefficient of order @xmath71 . for larger values of the scaling variable , where the free energy per spin lies above the equilibrium value ( see fig.[freescale ] ) , the barriers decrease .",
    "the straight line in fig.[barrierscale ] has a slope @xmath72 , so if the data were to follow this line it would indicate that the barriers become @xmath6-independent at higher free energies .",
    "recall that the barriers averaged over _ all _ tap states were found to actually decrease with @xmath6 , roughly as @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the states of a given free energy reached by our particular algorithm almost certainly do not sample _ all _ states of that free energy uniformly .",
    "the scaling behavior of the excess free energy per spin and of the barrier heights for large argument @xmath65 , namely @xmath74 and @xmath75 , indicates that ( at least for large @xmath67 ) the barrier height is directly proportional to @xmath76 with no dependence on @xmath6 or @xmath77 .",
    "[ barrierfree ] demonstrates that surprisingly this is not only true for large @xmath67 but for _ all _ values of @xmath6 and @xmath77 explored .",
    "this is an important result since the dependence on the unphysical @xmath48 has been eliminated and the relation @xmath78 is a property of physical quantities alone .",
    "according to our picture of the tap landscape described in @xcite , the hessian at a minimum should , in the thermodynamic limit , have one null eigenvalue and a band of eigenvalues starting at a value strictly larger than zero . in order to confirm this",
    ", we have studied the eigenvalues of the hessian at the solutions found by our algorithm .",

    "[ minevalq ] ) which is at first sight contradicting our landscape picture",
    ". however , the eigenvalues @xmath80 show a strong correlation with the corresponding value of @xmath81 at the minimum .",
    "this is understandable from the form of the hessian , eq .",
    "since the smallest eigenvalue will be of the same order of magnitude as the smallest diagonal entry of @xmath82 , which is proportional to @xmath83 ( @xmath84 being the @xmath85 closest to 0 ) . therefore , for @xmath81 very close to 1 , @xmath86 . fluctuations of @xmath81 towards @xmath60 will therefore cause great fluctuations in @xmath80 . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath81 should be self - averaging , therefore the variations in @xmath80 become small and our observation merely indicates the enormous finite - size corrections still present at our accessible system sizes .    finite size scaling plot of the average smallest eigenvalue @xmath87 of the hessian at a minimum versus @xmath88 .",

    "the correlation between @xmath80 and @xmath81 and the strong variation of @xmath80 over several orders of magnitude indicate that a simple average of @xmath80 might not be very informative .",

    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ minevalq ] in a finite size scaling plot which shows good data collapse , in particular for larger @xmath6 .",
    "there are several points to notice in this figure .",
    "first , the eigenvalues scale with @xmath89 but can still be very large ( of the order @xmath91 or more at the very low temperature , @xmath92 , at which we are working ) .",
    "second , for larger @xmath6 the range of @xmath81-values shrinks . this must be the case as in the thermodynamic limit there should be only one value of @xmath81 .",
    "third , the range of @xmath80 also shrinks and @xmath93 ( where the average now includes all values of @xmath81 ) goes to zero as @xmath89 ( note that it would have been very difficult to obtain this result from a simple @xmath81-independent average of @xmath80 ) .",
    "this is in support of the picture of the tap free energy landscape outlined previously @xcite which asserts that minima and saddles occur in pairs which move closer together as the system size grows .",
    "the smallest eigenvalues of the hessian therefore have to go to zero with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "overlap between the eigenvector @xmath94 of the hessian belonging to the smallest eigenvalue and the normalized difference vector @xmath95 between a minimum and the corresponding saddle as a function of @xmath96 .",

    "if the two vectors were uncorrelated , the distribution of their overlaps would be sharply peaked around zero .",
    "the figure shows , however , that they are strongly correlated and that the direction of the smallest eigenvector coincides with the direction in which the corresponding saddle is found .",

    "in this work we have compared and contrasted the free - energy landscapes of two closely related models , described by the tap equations and the nmf equations respectively . the tap free - energy surface has a simple structure with turning points of only two types minima , and saddle points of index 1 .",
    "furthermore , the minima and saddle - points occur in pairs , each containing a minimum and a saddle point that are close neighbors in configuration space . by using a novel algorithm controlled by a single parameter @xmath48",
    ", we are able to access tap states whose free energy per spin is equal to the _ equilibrium free energy per spin _ at the given temperature , with an excess _ total _",
    "free energy of order 10 ( see fig .  [ freescale ] ) .",
    "this is achieved by choosing the parameter @xmath48 close to a critical value , @xmath108 , beyond which the iterative dynamics becomes chaotic .",

    "the scaling function @xmath115 should behave as @xmath116 for large @xmath67 , so that @xmath109 becomes of order @xmath6 away from the critical point , while @xmath117 is a non - zero constant .",
    "we have also studied the free - energy barriers , given by the free - energy difference between a minimum and its corresponding saddle point . in the low free - energy regime where @xmath118 , the barriers seem to grow as @xmath16 , albeit with a small coefficient , while for @xmath119 we expect the barriers to be of order unity or smaller ( see fig .",
    "[ barrierscale ] ) .",
    "this leads to a picture where only the lowest free energy states ( with free energies per spin equal to the equilibrium one ) are separated by barriers which increase in some manner with @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to the tap free - energy function , the nmf free energy has saddle points with index @xmath8 taking values up to order @xmath6 .",
    "the separate complexities @xmath120 have been computed numerically ( see fig .   [ multicomplexity ] ) .",
    "the free energy at which the minima start to outnumber ( exponentially in @xmath6 ) the saddle points seems to play the role of a threshold free energy which acts as lower bound on the free energy that is dynamically accessible ( fig .",
    "[ crossingpoints ] ) .",
    "we conclude with with some general remarks concerning optimization problems .",
    "if one is faced with a combinatorial optimization problem , such as finding the ground state of a spin glass , one approach is to write down tap - like equations and solve them using an iterative scheme which is related to a descent procedure on the free - energy landscape . as the temperature is lowered the states obtained approach those of a zero - temperature problem . in the spin - glass context , it does not seem to matter , _ a priori _ , whether the finite - temperature generalization of the problem is through the tap equations or the nmf equations , since they become identical at @xmath19 .",
    "we believe , however , that the very different structures of the free - energy landscapes in the two models will make a very big difference in practice . while the nmf free - energy surface is ` robust ' , with its threshold free energy and , presumably , large free energy barriers between states , the tap free energy surface may be termed ` fragile ' . with any such problem",
    "therefore , it will pay to construct finite - temperature equations corresponding to a free energy with a fragile structure .",
    "this process might be called ` sculpting the free - energy landscape ' .",
    "finally we would like to point out that using algorithms which take one off the free - energy surface into physically unreachable regions before reaching the final physical fixed point may also have great utility , as illustrated by our ` edge of chaos ' algorithm .",
    "the success of this type of algorithm seems to be partly due to the fact that by allowing unphysical values of the @xmath0 one can tunnel through barriers and partly because tuning the adjustable parameter @xmath48 towards the edge of chaos yields the solutions of low free energy which tend to be surrounded by the highest barriers which can trap the algorithm into a fixed point solution .",
    "we mainly used the ` edge of chaos ' algorithm in connection with solving the tap equations but it seems to work well also for the nmf equations . in fig .",
    "[ crossingpoints ] we have included the results obtained by setting @xmath121 which is close to the ` edge of chaos ' but without attempting to tune it to its optimum value for each value of @xmath6 .",
    "( for the nmf equations the edge of chaos seems to be close to 2 and the values of @xmath48 which give stable solutions are less than the critical value ) .",
    "it is clear that it outperforms the other iterative algorithms , which approximate to descents on the free - energy surface , by a considerable margin . at @xmath19",
    "the algorithm is especially simple and fig .",
    "[ zerotenergiesshifted ] shows that it seems to work as efficiently as the ` edge of chaos ' algorithm applied to the tap equations at low temperatures .",
    "however , it does suffer from similar problems as the ` edge of chaos ' algorithm when applied to the tap equations : we noticed that the number of iterations required to achieve convergence to a fixed point increased dramatically as the system size @xmath6 increases , or as @xmath48 approaches its critical value .    in the context of mean - field problems such as finding the groundstate of the sk model ,",
    "the ` edge of chaos ' algorithm works well .",
    "we have also tested it on the one - dimensional spin glass at @xmath19 , ( which can of course be solved exactly , enabling one to easily judge the accuracy of any proposed treatment ) .",
    "although it again outperformed simple descent algorithms it was hard to get solutions whose energies per spin were equal to the equilibrium energy per spin .",
