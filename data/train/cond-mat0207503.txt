    "particles at the lattice sites are allowed to take 7 possible velocities , @xmath32 .",
    "boolean variables indicate the occupation number at a particular site at a given time .",
    "the dynamics is such that no more than one particle enters the same site at the same time with the same velocity ; the exclusion principle .",

    "multi phase flows in which different species of fluids coexist , move and interact are an important domain of application of the lattice gas approach .",
    "models for miscible , immiscible and reactive flows have been proposed .",
    "interaction between the species are the key ingredient of multi - phase flows and depending on the nature of the physical processes , different interactions will be considered .",
    "the lattice gas approach has the important advantage that the interface between the different fluids appear naturally as a consequence of the way the fluids are modeled in terms of particles . in this paper , we represent the different phases by assigning the particles a  color \" .",
    "now the state of any vertex at @xmath33 is specified by a total density vector @xmath34 and the color vectors @xmath35 with boolean variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 as the components of this vector . in the case of ternary mixtures , @xmath38 can take 3 values + 1 , -1 and 0 .",

    ", particles at a given lattice site can exchange their velocity and color .",
    "the collision rules are such that the work performed by the flux against the field is minimized , subject to the constraints of the exclusion principle as well as the principles of mass , momentum and particle conservation .",
    "there can be a number of configurations which satisfy the above constraints , and in principle one should pick up that configuration which minimizes energy from this full set of possible configurations . in practice only a  limited \" number of configurations",
    "are considered . in our simulations",
    "we take into account the following possibilities .",
    "if a site has more than three particles or if their total momentum is non zero , then we pick up all possible pairs and an attempt is made to exchange their colors .",
    "the exchange is accepted only if it lowers the energy .",
    "when 2 particles occupy the same site with opposite velocities there are two cases to consider . in one both the particles are of the same color .",
    "then a rotation of the configuration by @xmath49 or @xmath50 degrees is attempted as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the other possibility is that the two are of different colors .",
    "then we need to check the possibilities for @xmath51 and @xmath52 degree rotation .",
    "when three particles collide at an angle of 120 degrees there are three possibilities .",
    "when all the particles have the same color , they could just reverse their directions or retain their velocities . when the colors are not the same , similar to two particle collisions , the configuration could now be rotated by @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in all the above cases",
    "the lowest energy configuration is chosen as the final state .",
    "there is one special case of three particle collision in which two particles have opposite velocities and the third one is a zero velocity particle . in this case , apart from rotating the configuration an exchange of color between pairs is also attempted .",
    "next step in the simulation is the translation in which all particles are moved in the direction of their velocities .",
    "this collision and translation process completes one time step .    to understand the various competing terms in this model we first look at a two component fluid mixture and introduce the variables",
    "@xmath53 , @xmath54 , in the direction @xmath55 . the two components are now designated by @xmath56 . substituting these variables in the equations for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we can obtain from equation  [ three - energy ] the work done to be @xmath59    momentum conservation implies that the last two terms in the above equation do not contribute to the dynamics .",
    "the first term decides the energy of the interface between the two phases .",
    "the second term favors movement of particles toward higher or lower densities depending on their color .",
    "for example when @xmath60 this terms imply higher diffusivity of particles with @xmath61 .",
    "thus increasing @xmath62 is like increasing the  temperature \" .",
    "the earlier lattice gas model for two component fluids by rothman and keller ( rk model ) used @xmath63 .",
    "in this model the work done is given by @xmath64    where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we can then introduce thermal fluctuation by defining an inverse temperature like parameter @xmath67 such that the new configuration at every time step is accepted with a probability proportional to @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "unless specified otherwise the results discussed in this paper are obtained using the gr model .",
    "we define the pair correlation functions @xmath69",
    "@xmath70    here the subscripts @xmath71 represent the color of the particles with @xmath72 .",
    "field values @xmath73 determines the _ phase _ at every lattice points .",
    "a lattice point belongs to the @xmath74 phase if @xmath73 has a value higher than the other two .",
    "this means that most of the particles there belong to the @xmath74 color .",
    "we calculate the length @xmath75 as the first zero of the correlation function @xmath76 .",
    "for the immiscible case wherein all three phases have the same surface tension , to calculate the border length and cluster size of the domains of a particular phase , say a , we use the following algorithm .",
    "all lattice sites are picked sequentially . if a particular site belongs to the phase a and is not assigned a cluster number we give it a new number .",
    "all the neighbors of this site are then checked .",
    "if the neighbor belongs to the phase a , three possibilities arise . in one ,",
    "the site does not have an assigned cluster number .",
    "we will then give this neighbor the same cluster number as the present site .",
    "in the second case , the neighbor has a number which is the same as the site .",
    "here we do not have to do anything more . in the third case",
    "the neighbor has a number which is different from that of the present site .",
    "that is , the neighbor belongs to a different cluster . in that case , the clusters are merged by assigning smaller of the two numbers to all sites in the two clusters .",
    "a lattice site which belong to a particular phase is a border site if one of its neighbors is of a different phase .    in the case , wherein one of the phases is equally miscible in the other two ; for example let us consider c miscible in a and b , we have two phases , the a - c phase and the b - c phase , see figure 3 .",
    "to label the domains we then follow the same procedure as before .",
    "any site belongs to the a - c phase if it is an a site or a c site whose neighbors are all a or c. for example region c in figure 3 belongs to the a - c phase .",
    "the border of the a - c domain could be a a or c site .",
    "if it is an a site , it should have at least one b neighbor ( region d in figure 3 ) or a c neighbor with the next nearest neighbor as b ( region a in figure 3 ) .",
    "if the border site belongs to the c phase then it should either have a neighbor which is a b site ( region b in figure 3 ) or a c neighbor with the next nearest neighbor as b ( region a in figure 3 ) .",
    "in the simulations , to prepare the initial configuration a particle is placed at a randomly chosen site .",
    "the velocity of the particle is chosen randomly from the seven possible directions such that the total momentum summed over all particles is zero .",
    "the color of the particle is again assigned randomly depending on the volume fraction of each component .",
    "once the initial configuration is prepared the ensuing dynamics conserved the total number of particles , the net momentum , the total kinetic energy and the volume fraction of each components .",
    "simulations are performed on a triangular lattice with 360000 lattice points with periodic bondary conditions .",
    "the results are averaged over 10 initial configurations .",
    "the dynamic exponents are obtained by a power law fit over one decade in time .",
    "in this section we reexamine the well studied case of binary fluid coarsening following a critical quench .",
    "the fluids are labeled by @xmath77 .",
    "let us first look at the case @xmath78 .",
    "the time dependence of average domain size @xmath1 which scales the same way as @xmath79 is shown in figure 4 . at early time",
    "we see lifshitz - slyozov - wagner(lsw ) @xmath80  @xcite growth . at late times",
    "the growth of domains is controlled by the inertial hydrodynamics and we have the well known @xmath31 growth law  @xcite .    to check for scaling we compare the length @xmath81 given by the first zero of the correlation function with the total border length @xmath82 . as can be seen from figure 4 , at late time , in the inertial hydrodynamic regime",
    ", the length @xmath83 also exhibits power law dependence with a dynamic exponent @xmath29 .",
    "this agrees with earlier studies on binary fluid phase separation which predict scaling to hold in the inertial regime  @xcite .",
    "we now investigate the more general case of @xmath84 with @xmath85 . the dynamic exponents @xmath86 and",
    "@xmath87 characterising the time dependence of @xmath81 and @xmath83 seem to vary differently with @xmath88 this is depicted in figure 5 .",
    "this results imply break down of scaling .",
    "the absence of scaling is clearly manifested in the snap shots given in figure 6 , the coarsening process is through the breaking and joining of domains . since the length @xmath1 is decided by the big clusters it has a dynamical exponent characteristic of coalescence . on the other hand",
    "the total border length @xmath89 has significant contribution from the small clusters which coarsen through evaporation condensation resulting in an exponent @xmath90 .",
    "similar change in the dynamical exponents of @xmath81 was observed as a function of the inverse temperature like parameter @xmath67 in the rk model  @xcite . for low @xmath67 values the coarsening mechanism very similar to that operating in the case of @xmath91 in the gr model .",
    "this is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath81 and @xmath83 shown in figure 8 confirms absence of scaling .",
    "these exponents indicate the presence of more that one coarsening mechanism operating at the late time regime .",
    "in the case of two fluid mixtures with unequal volume fraction we see the initial lsw regime crossing over to the @xmath5 regime controlled by the droplet coalescence mechanism .",
    "the first zero of the correlation function @xmath81 and the total border length @xmath83 in this regime seems to indicate existence of simple scaling  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we look at two separate cases of phase separating three component fluids.in one , we consider a _",
    "symmetric ternary mixture _ with all the components having equal volume fraction and with the parameters @xmath27 in equation-[three - energy ] set to @xmath92",
    ". this amounts to having the same surface tension for the @xmath93 and @xmath94 interfaces .",
    "the other case of interest is the _",
    "asymmetric mixture _",
    ", where we choose the parameters to be @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this choice of parameters ensures that one of the components ( _ solute _ ) is equally soluble in the other two .",
    "we will now discuss these two cases in detail .",
    "starting from the mixed state , the symmetric ternary mixture , when quenched below the transition temperature , evolves to form droplets of individual components .",
    "snap shots from the simulation , shown in figure 9 , clearly establish the existance of sharp interfaces between the components .",
    "the first zero of correlation function @xmath81 and the interface length @xmath83 are plotted in figure 10 as a function of time .",
    "initial regime corresponds to the formation of droplets . in figure-10",
    "we see a region with @xmath97 , where this droplets coalesce to form bigger domains .",
    "if the late time growth is due to the coalescence by droplet diffusion , as it is believed to be , then the following simple argument shows that the exponent should be @xmath0 .",
    "if r is the typical radius of a droplet , we have the droplet number density @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the volume fraction of the components in two dimensions .",
    "the time for a droplet to diffuse a distance of order of its radius is @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the area swept out by the drop in time t ( for @xmath102 ) is of the order @xmath103 . if @xmath104 is the coalescence time , the expected number of drops in an area @xmath105 is of the order unity , which means @xmath106 . since in two dimensions ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient , @xmath107 , does not have any dependence on the droplet size ,    @xmath108    this implies that r grows with time as @xmath109  @xcite .",
    "another mechanism for droplet coalescence is interfacial diffusion . at non zero temperatures",
    "the domains fluctuate from their circular shape .",
    "the area explored by the domain in time @xmath110 goes as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the diffusion coefficient for the interface.the coalescence time @xmath113 is then given by    @xmath114    here the length @xmath115 is such that @xmath116 area of the droplet . since the interface diffusion coefficient is not a function of @xmath115 , we get @xmath117",
    ". thus both the droplet diffusion and interfacial diffusion could give the same dynamical exponent .    to explore the possibility of the second mechanism we studied the stability of a drop to fluctuations from the circular shape .",
    "as shown in the appendix , in two dimensions , surface fluctuations die out exponentially , both in the case of a drop and a strip  @xcite of one fluid in another .",
    "this implies that in the @xmath5 regime , the dominant mechanism for coarsening is the droplet coalescence by diffusion .    .",
    "droplet coalescence is the only mechanism operating here is further confirmed by the existence of scaling . in figure 11",
    "we compare the time dependence of the total border length @xmath118 of the domains of component a with that of the first zero of the correlation function @xmath119 .",
    "we observe the same time dependence for both the lengths indicating scaling in the late time regime .      in this section",
    ", we discuss a ternary mixture with one of the components equally soluble in the other two . for this",
    "we choose @xmath120 and @xmath121 such that the component c ( @xmath122 ) is the solute .",
    "the components a and b are mutually immiscible .",
    "we choose a and b to have the same volume fraction .",
    "we now have a - c and b - c mixtures phase separating similar to the binary fluid under critical quench .",
    "as shown in figure 12 , the starting mixed phase separates into percolating domains of a - c and b - c phases .",
    "though the early time behavior is similar to the two component fluid with @xmath95 , the late time growth is analogous to the situation where @xmath84 discussed in section iii .",
    "the snap shots do not exhibit self - similarity , domains split up and combine during coarsening . in this regime ,",
    "the first zero of the correlation function exhibits a dynamic exponent @xmath5 .",
    "we would like to point out that for the same density , the two component fluid with @xmath95 exhibits a late time exponent @xmath123 and does not show any evidence of @xmath5 regime .",
    "thus the third component act to reduce the interfacial tension between the @xmath124 rich and @xmath125 rich phases leading to fluctuation induced breakup and reorganization of the domains . as the volume fraction of the component c",
    "is reduced , we observe a gradual change from the @xmath5 to @xmath7 regime .    in order to investigate the validity of the scaling hypothesis in this regime",
    ", we compare the length scales @xmath82 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is depicted in figure 13 .",
    "it is evident from the figure that these two length scales vary differently at late times .",
    "we have presented the dynamics of domain growth in binary and ternary immiscible fluids , using a two - dimensional hydrodynamic lattice gas model .",
    "various dynamic regimes are investigated by altering parameters like volume fraction , the interaction strength of the individual components and a temperature variable .",
    "we examine the validity of scaling in two component fluid coarsening by comparing the dynamic nature of the first zero of the correlation function and the total border length . while scaling holds in the droplet coalescence and the inertial hydrodynamic regimes , violation of scaling",
    "is observed in the fluctuation dominated regime .    in symmetric ternary mixtures ,",
    "we show the existence of a coalescence dominated regime with a single length scale exhibiting a dynamical exponent @xmath5 . in asymmetric ternary mixtures we use the concentration of the solute as a control parameter .",
    "we demonstrate that at higher solute concentrations , the coarsening is driven by fluctuations and scaling is violated .",
    "in this appendix , we look at the stability of a drop with radius @xmath81 against perturbations in its perimeter .",
    "we consider a drop of radius @xmath81 with the fluid in the region @xmath126 characterized by density @xmath18 , and kinematic viscosity @xmath127 surrounded by another fluid with density @xmath128 and kinematic viscosity @xmath129 .",
    "for an incompressible and vorticity free fluid we can define the velocity component using a streaming potential @xmath130 ss @xmath131 @xmath132            the coefficients @xmath141 and @xmath142 are obtained from the four equations ; the continuity of @xmath143 at @xmath144 , continuity of @xmath145 at @xmath144 , continuity of tangential stress @xmath146 at @xmath144 and the relation between normal stresses                since the right hand side of this equation is always negative , we come to the conclusion that in the limit of high viscosity there are no unstable modes . in the more general case , the condition for non trivial solutions leads to a transcendental equation for @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
