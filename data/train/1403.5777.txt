    "in the inner crust of neutron stars , nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) exist at low temperatures and densities embedded in a ( charge neutralizing ) degenerate electron gas . under those conditions , instead of forming the usual quasi - spherical nuclei found in earth ( `` normal '' nuclei ) ,",
    "nucleons behave like a complex fluid called neutron star matter ( nsm ) . in nsm , nucleons attract each other through the short - ranged nuclear interaction while protons , in addition , repel each other through the coulomb interaction screened by the electron gas .",
    "studies of low density nsm have found that the attractive - repulsive interplay of nuclear and coulomb forces may drive nucleons to take non - uniform configurations which are collectively known as `` nuclear pasta''@xcite .      in the context of nuclear systems , the existence of nucleer pasta",
    "was early proposed in a pioneering work by ravenhall _ _ et.al.__@xcite . there",
    "the authors argued that while at low densities the interplay between nuclei surface and coulomb self - energies alone produce the almost spherical normal nuclei , that is not the case at higher densities .",

    "the wigner - seitz approximation was devised to simplify calculations in a charge neutral lattice of arbitrary shape .",
    "it consists in replacing the charge neutral unit cell with another cell of a simplified geometry , adecuate for the chosen lattice dimensionality : a sphere in @xmath1 , a disc or cilinder in @xmath2 or a slab in @xmath3 .",
    "lattice coulomb energy is included implicitly by making the electrostatic potential vanish at the cell s boundary .",
    "the calculations from  @xcite were made at zero temperature with a proton fraction @xmath4 .",
    "nucleons were assumed to be arranged in dense matter regions at saturation density @xmath5 but filling only a fraction of space .",
    "ith this model they found that for a rather wide range of densities , nsm arranged in these idealized lattice geometries is more stable than uniform matter or normal nuclei .",
    "as described by the authors , these non uniform phases range in order of increasing density from spherical ( @xmath1 ) `` nuclei '' , cilindrical ( @xmath2 ) `` nuclei '' , passing through a slab - like `` nuclei '' , then to cilindrical `` bubbles '' , then spherical `` bubbles '' , until finally at @xmath6 the system becomes uniform .",
    "for each geometry the unit cell has a characteristic length @xmath7 which is the radius for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the half width of the @xmath3 lattice .",
    "although the value of this parameter is not given , the fact that the slabs are stable at volume fraction @xmath8 , where their width is of order @xmath9 suggests that the same is true for @xmath7 .    while groundbreaking , this work assumed possible shapes",
    "_ a priori _ by restricting them to some simple idealized geometries .",
    "the authors make no mention to a possible dependence of the results on the unit cell s size @xmath7 .",
    "but since surface effects are supposed to be at the core of the whole phenomenon , such drawback might be critical .    later on , to address this criticisms , williams and koonin",
    "improved the calculations@xcite by allowing nsm to assume any arbitrary configuration within a cubic unit cell of side @xmath10 ( which is not to be mistaken with a wigner - seitz cell ) under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "to allow for arbitrary configurations they divided the unit cell into a cubic lattice within that cell .",
    "the local number density of isospin symmetric nsm at each site was relaxed to minimize an energy functional .",
    "he energy functional was divided explicitly and _ a priori _ in bulk , surface and coulomb terms .",
    "for the proton - proton coulomb interaction , the zero temperature thomas - fermi approximation was employed @xcite , under which the coulomb potential is screened and takes the form :    @xmath11    since the thomas - fermi screening length is much larger than any other length scale involved , the authors argued that it is a good approximation to include electrons as a uniform background of negative charge , just to neutralize the system .",
    "the minimization of energy was carried out through a careful and complex procedure which involved variation of the local number density , the overall mean density and the unit cell s size and .",
    "due to computational limitations , the largest cell size considered was of @xmath12 .",
    "also , the authors state that the choice of a cubic cell was made solely for computational convenience but other geometries would be valid .",
    "they are aware that this poses a bias on the possible density configurations they may obtain , but also state that their calculations contemplate all possible density configurations which have periodic cubic symmetry .    with this model their results inculde , in addition to the original `` pasta '' , a new shape ( dubbed `` cross '' ) which they describe as a slab with regular holes .",
    "according to the authors , this new shape is an energy minimum only for a very small range of densities , and so shallow that it `` would be washed out by finite temperature''(sic ) .",
    "most interestingly , by increasing the mean density adiabatically this phase transforms into a regular slab , but in a larger cell .",
    "although the authors do not mention it , this is explicit proof that at least within this model , the shape that minimizes the energy depends on the arbitrary cell size , and that in order to find the true minimum energy configuration at a given density , several system sizes must be explored to avoid ( or at least exhibit ) finite size effects .",
    "more recently , monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations have become popular tools to study the behavior of nsm at sub - saturation densities ( @xcite . these simulations usually consider @xmath13 matter ( neutrons , protons and electrons only ) at a fixed number of particles , volume and temperature .",
    "electrons , however , are never included explicitly in the simulations but are treated either as an ideal fermi gas or a uniform background charge distribution for the double purpose of achieving charge neutrality and screening the coulomb interaction between protons .",
    "the advantage of using a , for want of a better word , `` microscopic '' and dynamical approach is that nucleons are treated individually instead of dealing with local densities . and instead of artificially splitting the energy contributions _ a priori _ in bulk , surface and coulomb terms , pairwise interaction potentials are used .",
    "the dynamics itself then arranges the nucleons in whatever shape is optimal for the model without any bias , except for the geometry and size of the simulation cell .",
    "similar non - homogeneous structures are found in solvated di - block copolymers @xcite and are , actually , inherent to any system with competing interacions of different ranges ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "phenomenologically , this usually manifests as a competition between bulk and surface or interfacial energies which is settled by adopting a geometry such that its surface is minimal  @xcite , while subject to constraints or frustration .",
    "the formation of nuclear pasta has even been described as a frustration of surface minimization produced by coulomb interaction@xcite . in any case , even partial or frustrated , surface minimization seems to lie at the core of the nuclear pasta phenomenon .    in mathematics the problem of finding the minimal surface subject to certain boundary conditions , is known as the `` plateau '' problem@xcite .",
    "a minimal surface can be defined as a surface with zero average curvature at every point .",
    "all the usual pasta , plus williams and koonin s crosses , cmd s `` jungle - gym''@xcite ( known as the plumber s nightmare in polymer physics ) , as well as the gyroid and double diamond structures  @xcite are solutions with cubic symmetry to this well studied problem  @xcite . for example , hf models for nsm  @xcite yield the so called schwarz s p - surface and d - surface  @xcite .",
    "cmd s jungle - gym also resembles the schwarz s p - surface .",
    "watanabe et .",
    "report that with qmd they find several `` triply periodic '' structures  @xcite .",
    "it seems that almost every pasta - like structures found in nsm simulations are actually triply periodic minimal surfaces of cubic symmetry , and as such , may be constrainted to some extent by the geometry and symmetries of the ( cubic ) primitive cell , not only by its size .",
    "most notably , whenever a model yields only one structure per cell  @xcite .    and",
    "since the `` triply periodic '' nature of most nuclear structures might be related to the symmetries of the cubic cell , exploring cell geometries with different symmetries might be enlightening .",
    "in any kind of particle - based simulations finite size is always a concern , but it is assumed that for large enough cells , the so - called `` finite size effects '' would become negligible . that , however , is not always true . at least not for every observable . in  @xcite , for example , grand canonical montecarlo simulations are performed for a lennard - jones fluid at densities that correspond to phase coexistence in the ( mean field ) van der waals approximation .",
    "the liquid phase in these simulations appears ordered in non - homogeneous structures eerily reminiscent to those observed in systems with competitive interactions .",
    "we shall refer to those structures as `` pseudo - pasta '' to distinguish them from `` true '' pasta , arising in systems with competing interactions .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show both analitically and numerically that at the liquid - vapor coexistence region of a lennard - jones fluid , the liquid phase is shaped in a very distinct way for a given density and temperature .",
    "they assume a cubic cell under periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and show that if that cell is large enough , the shapes of these pseudo - pasta are limited to one spherical drop , one cilindrical rod , one slab , one cilindrical hole or one spherical hole in the simulation cell ( in order of increasing number density ) .",
    "small transitional density regions exist due to interfacial effects related to the finite range of the interactions , but these effects become smaller as system size is increased and/or temperature is lowered . in the limit of infinitely large and/or cold systems ( @xmath14 )",
    "the transition densities can be calculated exclusively from surface minimization .",
    "this behavior is observed for systems of various sizes and , based on scaling properties of the landau free energy , it is shown that in the @xmath14 the size dependence of every _ intensive _ quantity vanishes .",
    "this is so because their size dependence appears explicitly through surface to volume ratios which become ( slowly ) negligible as the size is increased . but most notably , it is also shown for any large enough system , the transition from uniform liquid to uniform vapor is made in steps , passing through the same sequence of shapes expected in nsm ( spherical bubble , cilindrical bubble , slab , rod and spherical droplet ) but only one per simulation cell .",
    "unaware of most of these works , in @xcite we found the same structures for simulations of both lennard - jones and symmetric nm for several semi - classical interaction models for the nuclear interaction .",
    "our simulations were done at constant volume and almost zero temperature and without coulomb interaction .",
    "we explained these pseudo - pasta structures as minimal surface configurations under cubic pbc , and shown them to be the most stable configuration independently of system size ( consistently with the results from @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we concluded that these behavior is intrinsic to the finite size of simulations under pbc , independently of the system size .",
    "that is to say,``finite size ''",
    "effects are not due to the system being small , as is usually interpreted .",
    "this scenario is very often ignored , but is inherent to simulations of any lj - like system .    given this background , it is feasible that at least some of the pasta structures found in nsm simulations ( with coulomb interaction ) might be biased by finite size and the particular boundary conditions imposed and should be explored .",
    "it is even possible that some may be entirely an artifact of the simulation itself , specially if the size of the simulation cell is small and for models that produce only one estructure per cell@xcite .    and in any case ,",
    "ignoring this fact may lead to wrong estimates of the true scale of the density fluctuations , which in the case of nuclear pasta is of paramount importance@xcite .      in this work we aim to show that in molecular dynamics simulations of ideal symmetric nucelar matter under periodic boundary conditions , the spatial configuration of the solution at sub - saturation densities and low temperatures is determined exclusively by the artificial periodicity of the cell .",
    "the same is true for a large variety of systems which we shall call lennard - jones - like ( lj - like ) systems .",
    "those are systems interacting through potentials that are repulsive at very short ranges and attractive at short - ranges . for this very general class of systems",
    ", the binding energy energy can be divided into a volume plus a surface ( or interface ) term :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 may be functions of the temperature , density or other variables . in the case of nuclear systems , this is nothing more than a truncation of the semi - empirical mass formula . as we argued in@xcite , energy minimization at fixed number density",
    "is achieved by surface minimization .    in section  [ geom ]",
    "we explore several possible symmetries for the simulation cell .",
    "we argue that even though cubic pbc are the most usual choice for numerical simulations due to their simplicity and the low cost of their computational implementation , they re not by any measure the only option available .",
    "in particular , we explore cubic , hexagonal - prism and truncated octahedron    based on the arguments exposed above , in section [ area ] we search for the minimum surface configuration as a function of the volume fraction of the cell which is occupied .",
    "we do so in the three cell geometries described in section [ geom ] and show that the configuration predicted for a given volume fraction depends on the arbitrary choice of pbc .",
    "the predictions of section  [ area ] are verified with molecular dynamics simulations of symmetric nm within the framework of the semi - classical model cmd , which is described in section  [ md ] .",
    "simulations were done at almost zero temperature , at three relevant densities , for two system sizes and in the three different cell geometries .",
    "the results of the simulations themselves are presented and discussed in section  [ res_no_coul ] .",
    "in addition , and since the motivation for this research is the simulation of nsm which includes competing interactions , we also performed simulations with the model nuclear interaction plus a screened coulomb potential , a model for nsm .",
    "the same model was already used in@xcite .",
    "these simulations were done at the same temperature and densities , and under all three pbc geometries but for only one size .",
    "results are presented and discussed in section  [ res_coulomb ] .",
    "we close with some concluding remarks in section [ conc ] .",
    "in this work we use a classical molecular dynamics model , @xmath18  @xcite , based on the work of v. pandharipande .  @xcite .",
    "it has been very fruitful in nuclear studies of , among other phenomena , neck fragmentation@xcite , phase transitions @xcite , critical phenomena  @xcite , the caloric curve  @xcite , and isoscaling @xcite all without any adjustable parameters .",
    "recently we extended it to be used in the study of nsm  @xcite .",
    "we include here a brief synopsis but readers are directed to these references for further details on the model .",
    "@xmath18 treats nucleons as classical particles interacting through a two - body potential and solves the coupled equations of motion of the many - body system to obtain the time evolution of all particles . since the @xmath19 information is known for all particles at all times , it s possible to know the structure of the nuclear medium from a particle - wise perspective .",

    "notice that no bound state of identical nucleons can exist .",
    "it has many common features with potentials used by other models  @xcite .",
    "the cutoff radius is @xmath23 after which the potentials are set to zero .",

    "the size of the simulation cell should be significantly larger than @xmath28 .",
    "since the fulfillment of this requisite leads to prohibitively large systems , it has become a standard to artificially set @xmath32 and use the first image convention to evaluate the forces  @xcite .",
    "however , as we discuss in  @xcite , for this model of nuclear interaction a value of @xmath33 is needed to correctly produce the known pasta phenomenology .",
    "the trajectories of individual nucleons are tracked using a verlet algorithm and to control the temperature of the system we use an andersen thermostat  @xcite .",
    "to achieve almost zero temperature , we set the thermostat to succesively lower temperatures by small steps letting the system reach thermal equilibrium at every step until @xmath34 is reached .",
    "at that temperature , the nucleons are almost frozen , but we further cool it to @xmath35 so that thermal fluctuations can be safely neglected .",
    "periodic boundary conditions can be imposed on any polyhedra that fills space by translations . in order to fulfill that requirement",
    ", each face of the cell must have another face parallel to it and in the exactly opposite side of the cell , which earns this polyhedra the denomination of parallelohedra@xcite .    in this section",
    "we describe the three different unit cells we used in our simulations : cubic , hexagonal prism ( hp ) and the truncated octahedron ( to ) or cubo - octahedron . to quantify the size of each cell we use the distance between opposing faces @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is @xmath38 for cubic cell , @xmath39 for hexagonal prism cell and @xmath40 for the truncated octahedron . as a measure of the ` sphericity ' of each cell",
    ", we calculate the ratio between @xmath41 the circumsphere radius and the inscribed sphere radius as in @xcite .",

    "is the `` most spherical '' cell of the three .    to summarize , the cubic cell has the largest surface to volume ratio of the three cells , followed by the hexagonal prism and then the truncated octahedron .",
    "the cubic cell is also the farthest from spherical of the three .",
    "the hp , even if it is closer to spherical than the cube , is less isotropic than the other two . among these three",
    ", the less biasing option seems to be the to since it s the most spherical , the most isotropic and has the lowest surface to volume ratio .",
    "the only advantage of the cubic cell seem to be its computational economy .      as we showed in  @xcite",
    ", simulations of symmetric nm or lennard - jones - like systems at @xmath68 , will produce non - homogeneous structures due to pbc at low enough temperature .",
    "when using a cubic cell , shapes are limited to one sphere , one cilindrical rod , one slab or their complementary shapes ( cilindrical hole , spherical hole ) .",
    "except for small transition regions , these shapes exhaust the possible solutions .",
    "we also showed that , at a given volume fraction , the stable configuration was that which had the least surface area among these five options . to compute the surface area for each shape",
    "we had explicitly assumed they were inscribed in a cubic cell under pbc . because of the pbc , cilinders and slabs formally extend to other cells , thus the apparent surface of these structures which lies on the edges of the cells is not considered .    in this section",
    "we extend those calculations , restricted to the same set of shapes , but now inscribed in each of the three periodic cells described in section  [ geom ] .",
    "simulations show that rods and slabs favor certain orientations related to the particular symmetries of each cell .",
    "for example , rods pierce the cell orthogonally to some pair of opposing faces , avoiding edges .",
    "moreover , rods are always orthogonal to faces of the largest area possible ( i.e. the hexagonal faces in both hp and to , see section  [ geom ] )    to compute the effective surface area of a rod we treat it as an open cilinder ( without lids ) of length @xmath10 , the distance between faces , and set its radius based on the desired volume fraction .    as for slabs ,",
    "the opposite is true : they are always parallel to the hexagonal faces in both hp and to cells .",
    "in the to , a slab parallel to hexagonal faces cuts the cell through two of the square faces .",
    "our calculation has implicitly the additional constraint that the slab is thinner than the side length of the square faces .",
    "incidentally , that limiting case occurs at volume fraction @xmath69 , where the slab actually becomes a slab - shaped hole.    table  [ table1 ] shows the analytic expresions for the surface area of the usual simple shapes ( sphere , rod , slab ) for a given volume fraction @xmath70 and cell size @xmath10 .",

    "the most stable structure is that which minimizes energy .",
    "then , at a given volume fraction , energy minimization is achieved by surface minimization . in figure  [ fig_least_surf ]",

    "[ fig_least_surf ] is that the regions of stability of each shape are different for each cell geometry .",
    "in particular , at any volume fraction between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( black vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_least_surf ] ) , the most stable shape would be a sphere in the to cell , a rod in the cubic cell and a slab in the hp cell .",
    "this calculation predicts the same would happen for holes at the complementary volume fractions , but this is not exactly true in simulations because of the finite range of the potentials .",
    "qualitatively , it s reasonable that the to being the `` most spherical '' cell should be able to lodge larger spheres or spherical holes than the others before the cell becomes too small to avoid interaction between replicas .",
    "this is clearly reflected in fig.[fig_least_surf ] .",
    "but perhaps the most striking feature is that for the to , the region at which rods are most stable is very small : between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it s important to stress that the only physical assumption we made was that only bulk and surface energy contributions are relevant and pbc are imposed .",
    "whenever that is true , ( most notably when only lj - likepotentials are involved ) these results hold . and this is independent of the size of the cell since the surface area of every shape scales with @xmath79 .",
    "one should be mindful about this fact when interpreting results from numerical simulations that rely on pbc .",
    "in the previous section we showed , by using simple geometric calculations , that for any system that has only bulk and surface contributions to energy under pbc , the particular geometry of the cell has a great impact on which shape has the least surface area . in those calculations we only considered the three traditional simple shapes : sphere , rod and slab .",
    "while those three shapes almost exhaust the possible results from simulations of large enough lennard - jones and nm systems  @xcite in cubic cells , it s not clear that these three shapes constitute a representative set of the possible results in other geometries .    to test the results from the previous section and to search for a set of possible shapes for pbc other than cubic",

    "of course , these are indeed finite size effects which are likely to become less relevant for larger systems , we do not claim otherwise .",

    "in this work we show that simulations of symmetric nm using a semi - classical model produce , at subsaturation densities and low temperatures , non - homogeneous solutions reminiscent of the `` nuclear pasta '' expected in nsm but without a coulomb interaction .",
    "the solutions are shaped as a spherical drop , a cilinder , a slab or their complements ( cilindrical or spherical bubble ) depending on the number density , but only one per cell . by considering only surface and bulk contributions to energy ,",
    "we show that these non - homogeneous solutions are minimal surface configurations under pbc and , as such , are artificial .",
    "we explicitly prove this fact by showing that different primitive cell s geometries produce different solutions at the same physical conditions ( i.e. density and temperature ) .",
    "the same is true for any system of particles interacting through lennard - jones - like potentials ( i.e. , short - ranged , attractive and with a hard core ) .",
    "moreover , results from  @xcite suggest that at sufficiently low but finite temperatures ( namely , sub - critical ) , this results shoud approximately describe the behavior of the liquid phase in coexistence .",
    "more importantly , we show that , even if this behavior is indeed a finite size effect , it is independent of the actual size of the system ( if large enough ) and it does not vanish for infinitely large systems .",
    "the core mechanism behind these behavior is that at sub - saturation densities and low enough temperatures , particles tend to coalesce into a single , large , droplet .",
    "but as the droplet grows and approaches the size of the cell , it begins to interact with its own replicas in neighboring cells through the artificial pbc",
    ". then , the pbc allows the system to lower its energy by trading would - be surface for bulk , forming the pseudo - pasta .",
    "the system minimizes its energy by adopting a minimal surface configuration , but the configuration that minimizes the surface at a given volume fraction depends on the cell s geometry and has no physical meaning .    in other words , for lj - like systems , the only length scale , as well as the symmetries of the solution at low temperatures , are set exclusively by the simulation cell . and so , inhomogeneities are artificial .    on the other hand ,",
    "if a screened coulomb interaction is included , in addition to the lj - like potential , a new , physically meaningful length scale appears .",
    "this length scale is related to the maximum size an isolated droplet may have before the disruptive effect of the repulsive interaction breaks it down into smaller droplets .",
    "the same is true for any system of particles with competing interactions of different ranges .",
    "however , even in this case , the artificial pbc imposed can bias or constraint the length scale of the inhomogeneities , or even impose symmetries , if the system is not large enough .",
    "our simulations show that this is the case for systems not too large , since for some physical conditions the result depend on the cell used .",
    "in particular , for @xmath87 , the cubic and to cells produce several cilindrical tunnels , yet for the same physical conditions , the hp cell yields a single slab .    in nsm simulations ,",
    "it is acceped that a simulation or model that yields a single structure per cell suffers from finite size effects .",
    "this result show that producing multiple structures per cell is , by no means , evidence enough that the solution is free of such effects .",
    "nevertheless , it seems almost certain that for systems with competing interactions of different ranges , the artificial effects discussed in this work will become negligible if the system is large enough , as compared to the characteristic length scale set by the interactions . only in this case",
    "the inhomogeneities observed will be due to only the interaction potentials and the physical conditions .",
