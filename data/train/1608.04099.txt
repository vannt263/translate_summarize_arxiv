    "entanglement @xcite and nonlocality @xcite are considered to be significant resources that quantum mechanics offers.they have a ubiquitous role in information processing tasks and foundational principles , whenever one has to certify quantum advantage over conventional classical procedures .",
    "entanglement is a physical phenomenon in which many particles interact in a manner that the description of each particle separately does not suffice to describe the composite system .",
    "a resource of this kind can be used to demonstrate one of the strongest form of non classical feature i.e non - locality where the statistics generated from each subsystem can not be reproduced by any local realistic theory analogous to classical physics @xcite .",
    "bell nonlocal correlation along with entanglement are found to be key resources for many information processing tasks such as teleportation @xcite , dense coding @xcite , randomness certification @xcite , key distribution @xcite , dimension witness@xcite , bayesian game theoretic applications @xcite .",
    "+ however , the question of identifying an entangled state remains one of the most involved problems in quantum information . commonly phrased as the , it has been shown to be np hard@xcite . in lower dimensions viz .",
    "( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) there is an elegant necessary and sufficient criterion criterion to identify entangled states .",
    "negative partial transpose of a quantum state is considered to be a signature of entanglement whereas states having positive partial transpose(ppt ) are separable @xcite .",
    "the solution in higher dimensions lacks a bi - directional logic to certify a state to be entangled , more so with the presence of ppt entangled states @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an extremely useful operational criteria to detect entanglement is provided through entanglement witnesses(ew)@xcite.an outcome of the well - known hahn - banach theorem in functional analysis , entanglement witnesses @xmath3 are hermitian operators having at least one negative eigenvalue which satisfy the inequalities ( i ) @xmath4 separable states @xmath5 and ( ii ) @xmath6 for at at least one entangled state @xmath7 .",
    "the geometric form of the theorem states that points lying outside a convex and closed set can be efficiently separated from the set by a hyperplane @xcite .",
    "the completeness of this existence guarantees that whenever a state is entangled there is a ew to detect it @xcite . on the virtue of being hermitian",
    ", entanglement witnesses have proved their efficacy in experimental detection of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the notion of this separability axiom has been extended to identify useful resources for teleportation using teleportation witnesses @xcite .",
    "an elegant procedure to capture non - locality is through a bell - chsh witness @xcite .",
    "this bell - chsh witness is a translation of an ew to detect states which violate the bell - chsh inequality . on a different note , for two qubits , all quantum states @xmath8 do not violate the bell - chsh inequality iff @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is defined as the sum of the two largest eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the correlation matrix in the hilbert - schmidt representation of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath13 is a signature of the non - locality of the state@xcite .",
    "+ the prominent role of non - local states are highlighted through non - local games and randomness certification .",
    "randomness @xcite plays a key role in many information theoretic tasks .",
    "it has already been shown to be an important resource for quantum key distribution and cryptography .",
    "so an interesting question could be whether one can classify the states which are helpful to certify randomness , which has been answered affirmatively in recent times .",
    "now the question arises whether this class of resources can be expanded in a scenario where prior to the task all the subsystems are subjected to a global unitary operation . in this paper",
    "we deal with this question by characterizing the class of local states which can never be _ bell chsh - nonlocal _ under any possible global unitary operation termed as absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ states .",
    "as one can see that this class of states can never be useful for randomness certification task .",
    "we have further shown that for systems with hilbert space @xmath14 these states form a convex and compact set .",
    "this implies the existence of a hermitian operator which can detect such non - absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ states , a potential resource in the modified scenario .",
    "+ in the following section ( sec.[motivate ] ) we first outline the need for an operator to identify non - absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ states and its importance for a number of information theoretic tasks .",
    "parallely , the question of existence of a set containing absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ states has been addressed in relation to problems of an analogous type . in sec.[def ] we introduce the relevant notations and definitions to prepare a mathematical formulation . in sec.[proof ] we present the proof of the existence and a definite scheme of constructing such operators and illustrate with examples of absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ states in sec.[examples ] .",
    "finally we conclude in sec.[discuss ] .",
    "( b ) . now the unitary - evolved system is used to play a non - local game ( c ) . ]    pertaining to separability of quantum states , questions have been raised on the characterization of absolutely separable@xcite and absolutely ppt states@xcite .",
    "precisely , a quantum state which is entangled(respectively ppt ) in some basis might not be entangled(resp .",
    "ppt ) in some other basis .",
    "this depends on the factorizability of the underlying hilbert space .",
    "thus , the characterization of states which remain separable(resp .",
    "ppt ) under any factorization of the basis is pertinent .",
    "literature already contains results in this direction @xcite . precisely for two qubits ,",
    "a state is absolutely separable iff its eigenvalues(arranged in descending order ) satisfy @xmath15 @xcite .    in a different perspective ,",
    "violation of bell - chsh inequalities exhibits non - local manifestations of a quantum state . a state which violates the bell - chsh inequality",
    "is considered non - local . however , the violation of such an inequality invariably depends on the factorization of the underlying hilbert space and in this regard the study on states which do not violate the bell - chsh inequality under any factorization assumes significance .",
    "this study forms the main context of our present work.while intuition permits one to state that states which are absolutely separable will be eligible candidates under this classification , it is interesting to probe the existence of entangled states which come under this category .",
    "our results underscore the existence of states outside the absolute separable class , which do not violate bell - chsh inequality under any global unitary operation .",
    "global unitary operations play the anchor role here as they transform states to different basis .",
    "+ in standard bell - scenario the subsystems are allowed to share classical variables prior to the game and perform local operations only . for our purpose",
    "we consider a modified bell - scenario ( depicted in fig.[belldiag ] ) in which two parties are allowed to perform a global unitary @xmath16 prior to the collection of statistics from the joint - system .",
    "one can easily note that by performing a cnot operation on the initial state @xmath17 ( which is bell - chsh local ) , it can be transformed to @xmath18 which has a maximum bell - chsh violation of @xmath19 .",
    "this clearly shows that the set of resources for this modified bell - chsh scenario can be expanded to a plausible extent .",
    "+ now the question is how far can this extension is possible .",
    "contrary to the common intuition there exists states which do not violate bell - chsh inequality under any global unitary operation",
    ". then one can depict the set of resources in this modified bell - scenario as the green and yellow regions in a schematic diagram as shown in fig.[sets ] . to deal with this not - so - obvious scenario",
    "we prepare the mathematical framework hereafter beginning with a description relevant notations and definitions in the following section .",
    "we begin with some notations and definitions needed for our analysis.@xmath20 denotes the set of bounded linear operators acting on x. the density matrices that we consider here , are operators acting on two qubits , i.e. , @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the set of all density matrices .",
    "we denote by @xmath23 , the set of all states which do not violate the bell - chsh inequality @xcite , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 as the set containing states which do not violate the bell - chsh inequality under any global unitary operation  ( @xmath26 ) i.e. @xmath27 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath28 forms a non - empty subset of @xmath23 , as @xmath29 .",
    "a schematic diagram of the sets has been shown in fig.[sets ] .    .",
    "the set @xmath30 is characterized by the existence of the bell - chsh witness @xcite .however , we give a formal characterization below : +    @xmath23 is a convex and compact subset of @xmath22 .",
    "first note that the statements below are equivalent : + ( i ) @xmath31 + ( ii ) @xmath32 bell - chsh operator @xmath33 + ( iii ) @xmath32 bell - chsh witness @xmath34 + in view of the above , we can rewrite @xmath30 as , @xmath35 .",
    "now consider a function @xmath36 , defined as @xmath37 where , @xmath38 is a fixed bell - chsh witness .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 will have a maximum value @xmath41 ( say ) .",
    "therefore , one may write @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "@xmath43 is a continuous function as @xmath44 is a continuous function .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath45 is a closed set .",
    "continuing as above , one may define @xmath46 for a fixed @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath46 will be closed @xmath48 . since , arbitrary intersection of closed sets is closed , @xmath49 is closed .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath50 .",
    "hence , @xmath30 is closed .",
    "if we now take two arbitrary @xmath51 , then @xmath52 \\geq 0 $ ] for any @xmath53 , @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath55 \\geq 0 , i=\\lbrace 1,2 \\rbrace$ ] for any @xmath56.thus @xmath30 is convex . since @xmath57 is compact , @xmath30 being a closed subset of @xmath57 , is thus compact .",
    "hence the lemma .",
    "this theorem facilitates the characterization of the set @xmath25 as stated in the theorem below : +    @xmath28 is a convex and compact subset of @xmath23 .",
    "we only show that @xmath25 is convex as the compactness follows from a retrace of the steps presented in @xcite .",
    "+ take two arbitrary @xmath58 .",
    "one may rewrite @xmath59 \\geq 0 , \\forall b_{chsh}^{w } , \\forall u \\rbrace $ ] .",
    "therefore , for any @xmath26 , @xmath60u^{\\dagger } = \\lambda \\sigma_{1}^{\\prime } + ( 1-\\lambda)\\sigma_{2}^{\\prime } \\in \\mathbf{al } $ ] .",
    "this follows , since @xmath30 is convex .",
    "[ @xmath61 . +",
    "as noted earlier , one may see the compactness with a re - run of the steps in @xcite .",
    "hence , the theorem .",
    "the above characterization enables to formally define an operator(@xmath62 ) which detects states that violate bell - chsh inequality under global unitary .",
    "@xmath63 consider @xmath64 .",
    "there exists a unitary operator @xmath65 such that @xmath66 violates bell - chsh inequality .",
    "consider a bell - chsh witness @xmath3@xcite that detects @xmath67 , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "using the cyclic property of the trace , one obtains @xmath69 .",
    "we thus claim that @xmath70 is our desired operator .",
    "to see that it satisfies inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) , we consider its action on a state @xmath71 from @xmath28 .",
    "we have @xmath72 . as",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74,and @xmath75 is a bell - chsh witness @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that @xmath77 has a non - negative expectation value on all states @xmath78 .",
    "while the above theorem has provided a tool to identify states which can augment non - local resources under global unitary , it has also highlighted the existence of a set which contains states from which no non - local resource ( in terms of the bell - chsh inequality ) can be generated .",
    "it is therefore important to look for certain states which can belong to the absolutely bell - chsh local set .",
    "it is evident that , any separable state obviously belongs to @xmath23 . from the definition of absolutely separable states ,",
    "i.e. @xmath79 , @xmath80 being any global unitary operation , it is clear that after the operation of the global unitary the state remains in @xmath23 , i.e. all the absolutely separable states are absolutely bell - chsh local states .",
    "consider the bell - diagonal states , i.e. @xmath81 , where @xmath82 are the usual bell states . if now one imposes the dual conditions @xmath83 , it is easy to see that this state is not only separable but also belongs to @xmath84 and hence @xmath85 .",
    "werner states @xmath86 , where @xmath87 being singlet state , in @xmath88 are absolutely separable for @xmath89 , as a result it is also absolutely local here .",
    "it can now be asked whether there exist states which are not separable but belong to @xmath28 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath90 is entangled but does not violate bell - chsh for @xmath91 $ ] . in case of werner states there",
    "exist no global unitary operations @xmath80 such that @xmath92 will violate bell - chsh inequality for @xmath93 , as the first part of the modified state @xmath94 will always have bell - chsh value less than or equal to @xmath95 and the second part will have zero for any global unitary .",
    "it is evident that the werner states with visibility factor @xmath96 belong to @xmath28 but are entangled .",
    "consider another state ; @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , which is also @xmath28 for @xmath100 but entangled for @xmath101 .",
    "+      one may note here that , since unitary similarity is an equivalence relation , it partitions the absolutely bell - chsh local set into distinct equivalence classes . for e.g if we define an equivalence class for a definite @xmath102 as , @xmath103= \\lbrace \\tau : \\tau = u \\sigma_{al } u^{\\dagger } \\rbrace\\ ] ] then , all states @xmath104 $ ] are absolutely bell - chsh local . + hence if one considers the state having weights @xmath105 diagonal in the computational basis @xmath106 is a separable state but not absolutely separable for @xmath107 and it belongs to @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "it is evident from above that the state is in @xmath28 for @xmath109 .",
    "in standard bell - scenario the free resources are local operation and shared randomness . here",
    "we have considered an modified scenario where prior to the non - local game the subsystems are allowed to undergo a global unitary evolution .",
    "contrary to common intuition all quantum states can not be made to violate bell - chsh inequality even in this modified scenario . in this work we have shown that for two qubit systems these useless states which we call absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ , form a convex and compact set implying the existence of a hermitian operator which can detect non - absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ states , a potential resource in the modified bell - scenario .",
    "we also present a characterization of absolutely _ bell chsh - local",
    "_ states for a number of generic class of states .",
    "this analysis of bell non - locality presents a new paradigm for asking a number of important questions .",
    "firstly , one could seek for a generic characterization of absolutely _ bell chsh - local _ states even for two qubits .",
    "secondly , the question remains whether one could demonstrate the existence of non - absolutely _ bell - local _ witness operators for higher dimensional systems in different bell - scenarios@xcite and subsequently characterizing the set of absolutely _ bell - local _",
    "states for such systems .",
