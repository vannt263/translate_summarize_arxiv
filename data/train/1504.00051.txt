    "the realization that planets form in gaseous protoplanetary disks dates back to the collective works of swedenborg , kant and laplace . despite several alterations ,",
    "this nebular hypothesis has survived the test of time @xcite . nevertheless , a quantitative characterization of the consequences of planet - disk interactions @xcite and the associated sculpting of orbital architectures of planetary systems @xcite has only become an active field of research comparatively recently .    large - scale orbital migration of giant planets was first recognized as a theoretical possibility by @xcite , in an effort to quantify the orbital evolution of satellites embedded in circum - planetary disks .",
    "however , it was nt until the discovery of the first close - in extrasolar planets @xcite that this idea gained wide - ranging traction @xcite .",
    "accordingly , over the last two decades , disk - driven migration has been repeatedly invoked as a unifying mechanism to explain the various orbital properties of extrasolar giant planets @xcite as well as low - mass compact multi - planetary systems alike @xcite .",
    "qualitatively distinct modes of migration , characterized by different timescales and directions , can arise depending on the physical properties and structure of the disk as well as the embedded planet @xcite . because of this intrinsic diversity in physical behavior , simultaneous migration of multiple planets residing within the same disk may cause the orbits to approach each other .",
    "convergent orbital evolution can result in capture of objects into mean - motion resonances ( orbital states characterized by rational period ratios ) and evidence for this process is plentiful throughout the satellite population of the solar system @xcite .",
    "moreover , the existence of a substantial number of ( near-)resonant exoplanetary systems ( see @xcite ) suggest that resonant locking is not limited to satellites and is also active among planets @xcite .    despite their non - negligible count ,",
    "resonant systems comprise a minority within the current observational aggregate ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . instead",
    ", giant planets often reside on dynamically excited orbits that are believed to be a result of planet - planet scattering @xcite .",
    "the connection between processes that occur within the nebular epochs of planetary systems and the onset of large - scale orbital instabilities responsible for sculpting the observed semi - major axis - eccentricity distribution are at present poorly understood @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is entirely plausible that planet - planet scattering originates within compact systems assembled by disk - driven migration @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the presently favored view of the solar system s early dynamical history ( see @xcite for a review ) is consistent with the picture delineated above .",
    "that is , an evolutionary sequence where the giant planets emerged from the solar nebula in a multi - resonant configuration that subsequently became unstable , causing the planets to scatter onto their current orbits is broadly consistent with the available observations @xcite .",
    "numerous insights into the physical processes that operate within birth environments of planetary systems could be obtained if the orbital states at the time of nebular dispersion could be inferred . in practice , this is difficult to do for dynamically relaxed systems because planet - planet scattering is a highly stochastic  forward \" process that tends to erase all memory of the system s initial state .",
    "in other words , the characterization of the vast majority of the observational sample can yield only limited information about the primordial nature of the associated planetary systems because their dynamical histories have been chaotically eliminated . even in the solar system , where the modeling efforts have enjoyed a multitude of observational restrictions , strong degeneracies with respect to the initial state persist @xcite .    on the contrary , resonant planetary systems ( which have managed to escape the onset of instability )",
    "may in fact yield tangible constraints on the environment within which they formed . as such",
    ", they constitute exceptionally high value targets for theoretical inquiries .",
    "arguably the most exotic resonant exoplanetary system detected to date is gj876 @xcite , and this remarkable collection of planets will be the primary subject of this paper s study .",
    "with three objects locked in resonance , gj876 comprises the only well - characterized extrasolar multi - resonant chain , although additional multi - resonant systems exist within the _ kepler _ data set ( e.g. kepler-16 , kepler-79 , koi-730 ; @xcite ) .",
    "while this system exhibits some similarity to the galilean satellites @xcite , it differs from the io - europa - ganemede system in a crucial aspect : the resonant arguments of gj876 exhibit vigorous , yet bounded ( on multi - gyr timescales ) chaos @xcite .",
    "the architecture of gj876 is fully consistent with the picture of conventional disk - driven migration @xcite . as a result",
    ", the dynamical characterization of gj876 provides a rare window into the description of orbital properties of planetary systems , as they appear when they emerge from their natal disks . with this notion in mind , performing a theoretical analysis of the system s dynamical state with an eye towards obtaining some insights into the nature of the disk from which this system formed is the goal of this work .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    ", we examine the qualitative features of the system s orbital architecture and setup the basis for theoretical analysis . in section 3 ,",
    "we construct a perturbative model for the resonant dynamics of the system and elucidate the origins of chaotic motion in an analytical fashion . in section 4 , we consider the assembly of the multi - resonant chain in a dissipative and turbulent protoplanetary nebula . we conclude and discuss our results in section 5 .",
    "the observational saga of the gj876 system effectively spans the entire active history of exoplanetary science . the initial detection of a @xmath0 giant planet  b \" in a 61 day orbit dates back to the infancy of large - scale dedicated radial velocity surveys @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a @xmath1 companion  c \" on a 30 day orbit followed shortly thereafter @xcite , rendering the gj876  c - b \" pair the first mean motion resonance to be identified outside the solar system .",
    "taking advantage of the observational imprint of resonant coupling , @xcite and @xcite presented independent analyses of the radial velocity data that accounted for planet - planet interactions and were able to break the @xmath2 degeneracy inherent to radial velocity detections , deriving the system s inclination with respect to the line of sight of @xmath3 deg .",
    "concurrently , the signal of planet  b \" was confirmed astrometrically by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "detections within the system continued , as an additional close - in @xmath4 planet  d \" , residing on a 2 day orbit was announced by @xcite . under the assumption of a 3-planet system ,",
    "@xcite re - analyzed the available data and with extensive modeling derived a mutual inclination between the resonant planets  b \" and  c \" of @xmath5 deg .",
    "moreover , the study of @xcite confirmed the existence of planet  d \" and strongly hinted at the eccentric nature of its orbit ( see also @xcite ) .",
    ".adopted orbital fit of the gj876 system [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     [ frequencies ]    the latest advancement in the observational characterization of gj876 arose from the work of @xcite , who uncovered yet another resonant @xmath6 planet  e , \" occupying a 124 day orbit .",
    "further dynamical analysis revised the system inclination to @xmath7 deg and more importantly , showed that the evolution of the multi - resonant configuration undergoes bounded , yet chaotic variations .        over the last decade and a half ,",
    "the orbital state of the system and its origin have been studied by a substantial number of authors , employing a wide variety of methods .",
    "specifically , in addition to the studies quoted above , orbital characterization and stability have been explored by : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the assembly of the particular resonant configuration has been simulated and studied by : @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite examined the possibility of extra bodies being locked in the multi - resonant configuration .",
    "thanks to the long time - span covered by the radial velocity observations and the aforementioned fitting efforts , the orbital properties of planets  b \" and  c \" are well constrained @xcite . however , substantial uncertainties exist in the orbital solutions of the lower mass components  d \" and  e \" @xcite .",
    "the desired precision of the knowledge of the dynamical state of a system is largely dictated by the purpose of the calculation one wishes to perform . here",
    ", our aim is not to create an ephemeris for gj876 , but rather to shed light on the origins of chaotic motion within the multi - resonant system and place rough constraints on the properties of the nebula within which the system was born . to this end",
    ", we note that once a 4-planet system is adopted , chaos ( highlighted by the stochastic evolution of planet  e \" ) is more or less ubiquitous throughout the parameter space restricted by the data @xcite . consequently , for the purposes of this work , we shall simply adopt the best - fit co - planar orbital solution of @xcite at face - value , keeping in mind that quantitatively different evolutions stemming from nearby initial conditions can be equally representative of the system s dynamical behavior . to this end , we further remark that while the orbital fit of @xcite clearly favors a chaotic solution , there may exist quasi - periodic islands in phase space that reside within parameter space covered by observational uncertainties . for completeness , the adopted orbital solution is presented in table ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "note that in this work , we have adopted a host stellar mass estimate of @xcite , which differs from that of @xcite by @xmath8 , meaning that our results will differ from previous works on a detailed level .        for the purposes of understanding the evolution of the  c - b - e \" multi - resonant chain in the simplest terms possible , the perturbations arising from the close - in planet ",
    "d \" can be neglected .",
    "broadly speaking , this is justified by the fact that while each member of the chain interacts with its nearest neighbor(s ) via first order resonant terms that scale as @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the eccentricity ) , the averaged gravitational coupling between planet  d \" and the multi - resonant system is secular in nature and to leading order scales as @xmath11 @xcite . to confirm this argument , we numerically integrated the @xmath12-body evolution of the system using the ` mercury6 ` software package @xcite with and without planet  d \" and found no meaningful differences in the obtained solutions .",
    "it is further noteworthy that the mass of the outermost planet is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the two inner members of the chain .",
    "it is thus tempting to further simplify the system and treat planet",
    " e \" as a test particle , subject to perturbations arising from the  c - b \" resonant pair .",
    "numerical examination of such a setup reveals that qualitative aspects of the dynamical evolution of planet ",
    "e \" are largely insensitive to this assumption . on the contrary , under this simplification the evolution of the massive resonant pair ceases to be chaotic and instead exhibits quasi - periodic motion @xcite .",
    "figure ( [ f1 ] ) shows the results of the simplified integration where planet ",
    "e \" is treated as a test particle , and planet  d \" is neglected .",
    "evidently , the stochastic features of the multi - resonant chain arise entirely as a result of the perturbations of planets  c \" and  b \" onto planet  e , \" and the chaotic diffusion of the massive pair is communicated exclusively via a back - reaction .",
    "this attribute has important consequences for the purposes of constructing a simple model aimed at elucidating the dynamical structure that underlies chaotic motion .",
    "specifically , in this work we will take advantage of this characteristic and derive the chaotic properties of the system by considering the evolution of a massless planet  e , \" subject to periodic perturbations from planet  b , \"",
    "whose orbit is in turn modulated by interactions with planet  c. \"    panel a of figure ( [ f2 ] ) shows the numerically obtained time evolution of the longitude of perihelion of planet  b \" ( blue ) as well as difference between the longitudes of perihelia of planets  c \" and  b \" ( red ) . clearly , the  c - b \" resonant pair resides near a dynamical equilibrium characterized by alignment and co - precession of the apsidal lines of the orbits @xcite .",
    "such a state is actually quite peculiar for resonant orbits and is only possible when the orbital eccentricities are not small . indeed",
    ", the classical first - order expansion of the resonant hamiltonian @xcite does not capture the existence of this fixed point .",
    "to this end , @xcite developed an alternative expansion of the planetary three - body hamiltonian and showed that the resulting perturbative ( first - principles ) solution matches the numerically computed evolution well .",
    "taking a somewhat alternative approach , @xcite utilized synthetic perturbation theory to construct a lagrange - laplace like periodic solution for the resonant pair which also shows excellent agreement with @xmath12-body calculations .",
    "because the dynamics of the  c - b \" resonant pair have been studied extensively , here we shall not duplicate the published results and instead refer the interested reader to the aforementioned studies .",
    "as already briefly mentioned above , in this work we shall examine the consequences of gravitational excitation of planet ",
    "e \" facilitated by planet  b. \" in order to perform this analysis within a perturbative framework , we must first delineate an approximate functional form for the dynamical behavior of planet ",
    "b. \" let us begin by defining the following scaled cartesian canonical coordinates : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the longitude of perihelion .",
    "following @xcite , we note that in the ( @xmath15 ) plane the trajectory of planet ",
    "b \" is well described by a circle of radius @xmath16 that is off - set from the origin by @xmath17 ( see also the discussion on free and forced elements in ch . 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , we parameterize the evolution of planet  b \" in the following manner : @xmath18    in the above expression , @xmath19 rad / yr is the ( retrograde ) apsidal precession rate and @xmath20 is the phase offset , while the constants are set to @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "panels b and c in figure ( [ f2 ] ) depict a comparison between results obtained with an @xmath12-body simulation and the analytical prescription ( [ hkb ] ) . needless to say , the observed agreement is excellent .",
    "it is further noteworthy that the numerically averaged semi - major axis of planet ",
    "b \" does not deviate from its nominal value , @xmath23_{\\rm{b}}$ ] by more than a few parts in a thousand .",
    "thus , for the purposes of the following calculation we may readily neglect the semi - major axis evolution all together and set @xmath24_{\\rm{b}}$ ] . with a simple analytical model for the dynamical evolution of the perturbing planet at hand",
    ", we are now in a position to perform a perturbative analysis of the system s chaotic behavior .",
    "before we proceed , let us begin by defining restricted poincar@xmath25  action - angle variables in terms of standard orbital elements : @xmath26 e^2/2 \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\gamma = -\\varpi\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the gravitational constant , @xmath28 is the stellar mass , @xmath29 is the mean anomaly and the nominal action @xmath30 $ ] is evaluated at @xmath23 = 2^{2/3 } [ a]_{\\rm{b}}$ ] . for the remainder of the paper ,",
    "quantities not labeled with an index shall correspond to planet  e. \"      generally , unlike secular perturbations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , mean - motion resonances modulate both the eccentricity and semi - major axis .",
    "hence , keplerian motion can not be averaged over , and the corresponding part of the hamiltonian must be retained : @xmath31 expanding @xmath32 around the nominal 2:1 resonant semi - major axis quoted above , equation ( [ hkep ] ) takes the form : @xmath33 ^ 2 } + \\frac{\\mathcal{g}^2 m_{\\star}^2}{[\\lambda]^3 } \\big(\\lambda - [ \\lambda]\\big ) -   \\frac{3\\mathcal{g}^2 m_{\\star}^2}{2[\\lambda]^4 } \\big(\\lambda - [ \\lambda]\\big)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & = - \\frac{3 \\mathcal{g}^2 m_{\\star}^2}{[\\lambda]^2 } + 4 [ n ] \\lambda - \\frac{3}{2 } [ h ] \\lambda^2 , \\label{hkep2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34=\\sqrt{\\mathcal{g } m_{\\star}/[a]^3}$ ] is the mean motion and @xmath35=[n]/[\\lambda]$ ] . the first term on the second line of equation ( [ hkep2 ] )",
    "is constant and can thus be dropped from the hamiltonian .    upon averaging out short - periodic terms ( see ch . 2 of @xcite )",
    ", the component of the hamiltonian that governs first order ( in @xmath10 ) resonant planet - planet interactions ( within the framework of the elliptic restricted three body problem ) reads @xcite : @xmath36 } \\bigg ( f_{\\rm{res}}^{(1 ) } e_{\\rm{b } } \\cos(2\\lambda - \\lambda_{\\rm{b } } - \\varpi_{\\rm{b } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + f_{\\rm{res}}^{(2 ) } \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma}{[\\lambda ] } } \\cos(2 \\lambda - \\lambda_{\\rm{b } } + \\gamma ) \\bigg ) , \\label{hres}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are interaction coefficients that depend exclusively on the semi - major axis ratio @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in the hamiltonian ( [ hres ] ) gives rise to explicit time - dependence in expression ( [ hres ] ) .",
    "thus , the quoted model constitutes a non - autonomous dynamical system with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the hamiltonian can be made autonomous by extending the phase - space to three degrees of freedom @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the newly introduced action conjugate to time , @xmath43 .",
    "accordingly , substituting the solution ( [ hkb ] ) into equation ( [ hres ] ) , we obtain the following expression : @xmath44 \\lambda - \\frac{3}{2 } [ h ] \\lambda^2 + \\mathbb{t } - \\frac{\\mathcal{g } m_{\\rm{b}}}{[a ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times \\bigg (   f_{\\rm{res}}^{(1 ) } \\big ( ( \\epsilon + \\delta \\cos(g t + \\varphi_0 ) ) \\cos(2 \\lambda - n_{\\rm{b } } t - \\lambda_{\\rm{b}0 } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\delta \\sin(gt - \\varpi_0 ) \\sin(2 \\lambda - n_{\\rm{b } } t - \\lambda_{\\rm{b}0 } ) \\big ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + f_{\\rm{res}}^{(2 ) } \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\gamma}{[\\lambda ] } } \\cos(2 \\lambda - n_{\\rm{b } } t - \\lambda_{\\rm{b}0 } + \\gamma ) \\bigg ) , \\label{ht}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is an initial phase of planet  b , \" and",
    "@xmath46 is its mean motion",

    "let us define canonical cartesian coordinates related to the @xmath51 degree of freedom : @xmath52 after some algebraic manipulation , the hamiltonian obtains the form : @xmath53   - n_{\\rm{b } } ) \\theta - 6 [ h ] \\theta^2 + \\alpha \\delta \\cos(\\theta - g \\xi - \\varphi_0 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\alpha \\epsilon \\cos(\\theta ) + \\beta x \\cos(\\theta ) - \\beta y \\sin(\\theta ) + \\xi . \\label{hxy1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to reduce the number of harmonics present in @xmath54 , we follow @xcite and define the following canonical translation : @xmath55 this transformation morphs the first and second terms on the second line of equation ( [ hxy1 ] ) into a single term .",

    "the reduction of the hamiltonian to an autonomous two - degree of freedom system is now complete .",
    "qualitatiely , the hamiltonian ( [ haaone ] ) represents a system of two momentum - coupled pendulums .",
    "it is noteworthy that in isolation , the @xmath63 degree of freedom possesses the dalembert characteristic and thus has the dynamics corresponding to the second fundamental model for resonance @xcite whereas the isolated @xmath64 degree of freedom has the phase - space structure of a simple pendulum @xcite .",
    "the extent to which the perturbative model governed by hamiltonian ( [ haaone ] ) successfully captures the dynamical behavior of gj876  e \" can be tested numerically .",
    "however prior to applying hamilton s equations , note that in terms of action - angle coordinates , hamiltonian ( [ haaone ] ) possesses a coordinate singularity at @xmath65 .",
    "this nuisance can be circumvented by transforming to canonical cartesian coordinates : @xmath66 accordingly , the hamiltonian is rewritten as follows : @xmath60 \\left(\\mathcal{w } + \\frac{u^2 + v^2}{2 } \\right ) - 6 [ h ] \\left(\\mathcal{w } + \\frac{u^2 + v^2}{2 } \\right)^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & - g \\mathcal{w } + \\alpha \\delta \\cos(w ) + \\beta u. \\label{haa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding equations of motion take the form : @xmath67 - g - 12 [ h ] \\left ( \\mathcal{w } + \\frac{u^2 + v^2}{2 } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{du}{dt } & = - 6 [ n ] v + 12 [ h ] v \\left ( \\mathcal{w } + \\frac{u^2 + v^2}{2 } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{dv}{dt } & = \\beta + 6 [ n ] u - 12 [ h ] u \\left ( \\mathcal{w } + \\frac{u^2 + v^2}{2 } \\right )   \\label{eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after numerous variable changes , it is useful to explicitly relate the final variables ( [ finangles],[uv ] ) to keplerian orbital elements .",

    "the following relationships approximately hold : @xmath71 } \\simeq \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{[a ] } } - e^2 . \\label{var2kepref}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the last of the above expressions is closely related to the well - known tisserand parameter .",
    "orbital evolution obtained by numerical integration of equations ( [ eom ] ) is shown with black curves in figure ( [ f3 ] ) , where the results of an @xmath12-body simulation are also depicted with blue lines .",
    "evidently , the system described by hamiltonian ( [ haa ] ) provides an excellent perturbative representation of the real system , meaning that the dynamical behavior within the chaotic layer is well captured by a first - order expansion of the disturbing function .",
    "it is noteworthy that the semi - analytical solution initially tracks the @xmath12-body solution , but the two evolutionary sequences lose coherence after @xmath72 years .",
    "this is indicative of a lyapunov time that is a factor of a few shorter than @xmath73 years year lyapunov time reported by @xcite . ] .",
    "this places gj876 into the same category of rapidly chaotic systems as _",
    "@xcite .",
    "despite rapid chaotic diffusion , @xmath12-body calculations reported by @xcite suggest that the system is stable on multi - gyr timescales . in other words ,",
    "the chaos exhibited by the multi - resonant system is simultaneously vigorous and bounded .",
    "both of these characteristics can be qualitatively understood within the context of hamiltonian ( [ haa ] ) by examination of surfaces of section .    as a starting point ,",
    "let us examine the evolution of the angles depicted in figure ( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "note that the angle @xmath74 librates around @xmath75 while @xmath76 switches between libration around @xmath77 and circulation .",
    "preliminary intuition about the amplitude of orbital excursions can be obtained by constructing a double surface of section of the hamiltonian . in accord with the evolution of angles denoted in figure ( [ f3 ] ) , we fix @xmath78 and @xmath79 and plot level curves of @xmath54 on panel a of figure ( [ f4 ] ) .",
    "suitably , on the @xmath80-axis , we plot the scaled action @xmath81 $ ] while on the @xmath82-axis we plot the scaled momentum @xmath83}$ ] . because the hamiltonian ( [ haa ] ) is autonomous , any ( potentially chaotic ) trajectory it describes will be constrained to map onto a corresponding level curve ( given by the value of @xmath54 ) every time the orbital state crosses the section condition .    a red curve corresponding to the nominal semi - major axis @xmath84 $ ] is also shown on this panel .",
    "crudely speaking , the horizontal deviation away from the nominal resonance curve on the double section is indicative of changes in semi - major axis whereas vertical deviation corresponds to eccentricity modulation .",
    "thus , the area occupied by a given constant @xmath54 curve on the double section serves as a proxy for the amplitude of orbital variations associated with resonant motion .",
    "this point is of some importance to understanding the long - term stability of the system .",
    "particularly , this simple analysis suggests that to the extent that hamiltonian ( [ haa ] ) provides an adequate representation of the dynamics , the conservation of @xmath54 restricts the maximal deviation from nominal resonance of the trajectory , no matter how vigorously chaotic it may be .",
    "qualitatively , this explains how a rapidly stochastic system such as gj876 can remain stable on multi - gyr timescales .",
    "in addition to delineating energy contours on a double section , it is further useful to explore the actual dynamical behavior of the system on the contours ( i.e. provided specific values of @xmath54 ) . to this end , we have constructed poincar@xmath25  surfaces of section for the five highlighted curves shown on the double section , labeled @xmath85 .",
    "the sections are taken with respect to @xmath78 at @xmath86 and depict the @xmath87 degree of freedom .",
    "the surfaces are shown as panels b - f on figure ( [ f4 ] ) and are labeled according to the level of @xmath54 they represent .",
    "the value of @xmath54 that corresponds to the initial condition depicted in table ( [ f1 ] ) is @xmath88 and is shown on panel d.    quasi - periodic trajectories , shown as purple and brown curves dominate the surfaces of section that correspond to energy levels that yield the most limited orbital variations ( i.e. @xmath89 and @xmath90 , shown on panels e and f respectively ) . on the contrary , the remaining surfaces of section feature substantial chaotic seas , shown with black points .",
    "the location of a given point on the surface of section is related to the orbital eccentricity ( evaluated at the section conditions ) through expression ( [ var2kep ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the range of chaotic eccentricity excursions at a given energy level can be gathered from examining the extent of the phase - space occupied by the irregular region .",
    "note further that in all cases , the dynamics resides on a well - defined domain , which is restricted by the conservation of @xmath54 and the requirement for the actions to have a null imaginary component .",
    "the physical characters of the periodic points that reside at the centers of the nested quasi - periodic trajectories is not uniform across the plotted energy levels .",
    "particularly , on panels b and c , these orbits correspond to limit cycles that are characterized by rapid circulation of @xmath91 and a modulated circulation of @xmath92 , such that the majority of time spent on the circulation cycle remains in the vicinity of @xmath93 .",
    "conversely , fixed points in panels d , e , and f are true equilibria that are characterized by stationary evolution of the angles at @xmath94 and @xmath93 .    despite these differences",
    ", as long as the system is initiated within the extensive chaotic region ( irrespective of whether the value of the hamiltonian is set to @xmath95 , @xmath96 , or @xmath88 ) , the qualitative behavior of the dynamics resembles that observed in figure ( [ f3 ] ) . in light of this , it is tempting to obtain an estimate for the characteristic rate of chaotic decoherence of the system , that is independent of the exact value of @xmath54 .",
    "the simplest approach to such an estimate requires further reduction of the model .",
    "recall that the only assumptions inherent to the hamiltonian ( [ haa ] ) are the truncation of the disturbing function at first order in @xmath10 @xcite and the adoption of equations ( [ hkb ] ) for the dynamical evolution of the perturbing planet .",

    "instead , a statistical description of irregular trajectories is more appropriate @xcite . in a uniformly chaotic region",

    ". moreover , the evolutionary sequence appears to be independent of the assumed value of @xmath125 , as long as it exceeds @xmath129 . to this end",
    ", we note that @xcite favor a value of @xmath130 for the natal disk of gj876 ( which we adopt for subsequent calculations ) , rendering our results rather robust .    as with chaotic diffusion",

    "that is , although realistically the application of semi - major axis migration to planet ",
    "e \" affects the radial evolution of the whole system , this effect is not captured in the formulation of the hamiltonian ( [ haa ] ) introduces an unphysical dependence on @xmath125 into the perturbative model . ] .",
    "consequently , given that the action @xmath98 is directly proportional to @xmath131 , a more physical representation of the real system can be attained by only applying dissipative effects to the @xmath87 degree of freedom .",
    "suitably , the revised equations of motion take the form : @xmath132 where the subscript @xmath54 signifies the hamiltonian contribution .",
    "the equations corresponding to the ( @xmath133 ) degree of freedom remain unchanged from ( [ eom ] ) .    using the modified perturbative model , we have simulated the dissipative evolution of the system , starting with different values of @xmath54 depicted in figure ( [ f4 ] ) . the calculated eccentricity is shown as a function of time in panel b of figure ( [ f6 ] ) , where each curve is labeled by the starting value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding evolution of @xmath54 is shown in panel c of figure ( [ f6 ] )",
    ". evidently , two distinct modes of dissipative evolution exist : the approach to a limit cycle ( as shown by the blue curve , @xmath95 ) and the approach towards a fixed point .    as long as the damping is comparatively slow ( as discussed above ) , at each point along the evolutionary track , a purely hamiltonian snap - shot of the dynamical portrait yields a good representation of the orbital state .",
    "thus , the dichotomy inherent to the behavior of the dissipative evolution can be understood by examining the surfaces of section depicted in figure ( [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the addition of dissipative forces into the model alters the dynamical behavior into two ways : it leads to a gradual reduction of the phase - space area enclosed by a given orbit in phase - space ( see e.g. @xcite for a related discussion ) and an increase in the value of the hamiltonian . consequently , if the orbit is initialized somewhere within the chaotic layer ( see panels b , c and d of figure [ f4 ] ) , as time proceeds the orbit will tend to exit the chaotic sea and settle onto the center of the corresponding quasi - periodic island .",
    "simultaneously , the dynamical portraits will change in such a manner that the area enclosed by the constant - energy curves on the double section ( panel a of figure [ f4 ] ) will also decrease .",
    "the two processes are interrelated as the rate of change of @xmath54 grows as the action @xmath134 ( associated with the @xmath87 degree of freedom ) increases .",
    "if the starting condition of a @xmath135 orbit is chosen such that it is relatively close to the center of the quasi - periodic island depicted in panel b of figure ( [ f4 ] ) , the orbit will rapidly decay onto a limit - cycle that intersects the center of the associated poincar@xmath25  surface of section .",
    "concurrently , because such a limit cycle is characterized by a consistently low eccentricity , the rate of dissipative increase of @xmath54 will be reduced , rendering such a state of the system quasi - steady .",
    "an example of such an evolution is shown by the blue curves in panels b and c of figure ( [ f6 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath12-body solution shown in panel a of figure ( [ f6 ] ) also exhibits such behavior .",
    "if the system is initialized at a higher level of @xmath54 ( e.g. @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , the corresponding poincar@xmath25  surfaces of section depicted in figure ( [ f4 ] ) show that the limit cycle ( which turns out to correspond to a fixed point ) resides at a high eccentricity meaning that the evolution of @xmath54 will also proceed at an unhindered rate .",
    "consequently , on a timescale not much grater that @xmath136 , the system will settle onto an equilibrium described by a maximal attainable value of @xmath54 ( which also corresponds to a null area enclosed by the orbit in the double - section shown on figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "solutions of this kind are shown as pink ( @xmath88 ) , orange ( @xmath89 ) , and brown ( @xmath90 ) curves on panels b and c of figure ( [ f6 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath54 that separates the two regimes lies between @xmath137 .",
    "thus , it is possible to have a trajectory that first evolves onto a limit cycle , but upon crossing the critical value of @xmath54 , breaks out of the limit cycle and begins its approach to the fixed point .",
    "an example of such an evolution is shown in purple ( @xmath96 ) on panels b and c of figure ( [ f6 ] ) .",
    "irrespective of the details of the solution , a common feature observed in all evolutionary tracks is the approach to quasi - periodicity on a timescale comparable to @xmath124 .",
    "numerical simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) suggest that @xmath124 is considerably shorter than the lifetime of a disk .",
    "consequently , in absence of additional perturbations , the formation of a chaotic laplace resonance in a perfectly laminar protoplanetary disk appears unlikely .",
    "accordingly , in the following discussion we shall invoke turbulent forcing as a means of preventing the system from reaching dynamical equilibration .",
    "angular momentum transport within protoplanetary disks ( that facilitates accretion of disk material onto the host stars ) is typically attributed to turbulence @xcite that is expected to stem from the magneto - rotational instability @xcite or some other process .",
    "turbulent effects can have important consequences for resonant coupling and have generally been shown to lead to a breakup of resonant libration @xcite .",
    "therefore , provided sufficiently vigorous stochastic diffusion , it is reasonable to expect that turbulent perturbations may overcome dissipative interactions , allowing for the formation of a chaotic multi - resonant chain .",
    "as is with laminar disk - star interactions , the most direct way to calculate the evolution of embedded planets is using global 3d magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , such simulations can be computationally expensive and will likely preclude a statistically sound exploration of the relevant parameter regime . as a result , here we shall again opt for a parametrized treatment of stochastic forcing and perform the simulations within the framework of the perturbative model .",
    "the simplest approach to mimicking stochastic forcing is by introducing gaussian white noise , @xmath138 , into the equations of motion @xcite . following the purely dissipative treatment outlined above , we shall only apply these effects to the @xmath87 degree of freedom .",
    "moreover , as we will seek to examine the evolved outcome of these simulations , we shall additionally introduce a time - dependence , @xmath139 , to the damping and driving terms which will ( over a time considerably greater than @xmath124 ) cause these effects to vanish slowly .",
    "accordingly , the relevant equations of motion become : @xmath140 \\upsilon \\nonumber \\\\ \\frac{dv}{dt } & = \\left ( \\frac{dv}{dt } \\right)_{\\mathcal{h } } + \\left [ \\mathscr{f}_v - \\frac{v}{\\tau_e }   \\right ] \\upsilon . \\label{dampdriven}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    equations of the form ( [ dampdriven ] ) are typically referred to as langevin equations and yield solutions that should be interpreted in a statistical sense @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the integration of white noise , @xmath138 , yields the weiner process , @xmath141 ( a scaling limit of a random walk ) . with a zero expectation value ,",
    "the progress of a pure weiner process is @xmath142 , where the @xmath143 is the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "@xmath143 is directly related to the variance of @xmath138 , which we take as an adjustable parameter .",
    "if the stochastic term in the equations of motion is augmented with dissipative effects ( i.e. the terms within the brackets of equations [ dampdriven ] ) , the progress of the associated quantity becomes limited from above and upon saturation , approaches @xmath144 .",
    "consequently , for the system at hand , we can define a dimensionless number : @xmath145 } } \\leqslant 1 , \\label{dimentsionless}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that approximately characterizes the maximal eccentricity that the orbit would attain exclusively due to interactions with the nebula by unity from above , for bound systems . ] .",
    "note that the physical meaning of @xmath146 roughly parallels that of the turbulent schmidt number : it represents a ratio of turbulent forcing to viscous dissipation .",
    "thus , a value of @xmath146 that leads to the formation of a system that resembles the real gj876 resonant chain is informative of the properties of the protoplanetay disk in which the system was assembled .",
    "of course , the dynamical behavior of the actual damped , driven two degree of freedom system is quite complex ( in part because the value of @xmath54 changes substantially ) , and it is not clear what value of @xmath146 leads to favorable evolution a - priori .",
    "thus , we have performed a series of monte - carlo numerical experiments in an effort to survey the characteristic outcome as a function of @xmath146 .",
    "for all simulations , a starting value of @xmath135 , corresponding to the poincar@xmath25  surface of section depicted in panel b of figure ( [ f4 ] ) , was adopted and the initial condition was chosen randomly on the section . indeed , the choice of the starting value of @xmath54 is somewhat arbitrary and is generally unimportant because ( with the exception of a finely tuned set of parameters ) the system quickly loses memory of its starting state .",
    "each integration spanned @xmath147 years and the functional form for the time - dependence quoted in equations ( [ dampdriven ] ) was chosen to be @xmath148 , where @xmath149 .",
    "a range of @xmath150 was explored and 30 realizations of the system were integrated per choice of @xmath146 . upon completion of the integrations ,",
    "the end state of each simulation was used as an initial condition for a purely hamiltonian integration ( equations [ eom ] ) and a surface of section corresponding to the particular orbit was constructed .",
    "the stochastic properties of the orbit were then examined .",
    "the results of the monte - carlo survey are shown in figure ( [ f7 ] ) .",
    "most importantly , panel a shows the probability of capture into a chaotic laplace resonance as a function of @xmath146 .",
    "it is striking that the probability of reproducing the observed state can be substantial within the context of our model , however this remains the case only for a rather restricted range of parameters .",
    "particularly , the probability of success is nearly @xmath151 for @xmath152 but drops to zero for @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the reason for a relatively narrow range of @xmath146 that allows for chaotic resonances as an outcome has to do with the evolution of @xmath54 . in the case of the over - damped system ( where @xmath146 is low )",
    ", the evolution essentially proceeds as described in the preceding discussion of a purely dissipative setup .",
    "that is , the trajectory collapses onto a nearby quasi - periodic island and @xmath54 evolves to a stationary value characterized by an equilibrated orbital state . in the case of an over - driven system ,",
    "a somewhat different picture emerges . as turbulent forcing allows the orbit to explore the phase - space stochastically , the system eventually exits the resonance all together , and settles onto an orbit dominated by secular interactions ( not accounted for in our model ) .",
    "such evolutions are marked by a substantial decrease in the value of the hamiltonian .",
    "the evolution of the eccentricity and the value of @xmath54 for representative trajectories observed in our simulations are plotted in panels b and c of figure ( [ f7 ] ) respectively .",
    "the evolutionary track shown in brown , exhibits some similarity to that discussed within the context of purely dissipative evolution .",
    "specifically , @xmath54 increases to its maximal value and the system settles to the vicinity of a fixed point .",
    "note however , that owing to turbulent forcing , the system retains a finite libration amplitude at the end of the simulation , shown by non - negligible oscillation of the eccentricity .",
    "the purple evolutionary track is also similar to the purely dissipative case , but lies in the limit - cycle category .",
    "correspondingly , the eccentricity evolution resembles the results of @xmath12-body integrations , depicted in panel a of figure ( [ f6 ] ) .",
    "an over - driven simulation , where the system breaks out of resonance and ultimately settles onto a quasi - periodic orbit ( see also @xcite ) is shown in red .",
    "note that in this simulation , the evolution of the hamiltonian occurs in the opposite sense compared to the over - damped simulation .",
    "that is , the value of @xmath54 decreases relative to its initial condition .",
    "finally , an orbit that settles onto a chaotic laplace resonance is shown in blue . here , the value of @xmath54 remains close to the @xmath155 range where the poincar@xmath25  surfaces of section depicted in figure ( [ f4 ] ) show a considerable fraction of phase - space that is occupied by chaotic seas .",
    "as such , in this simulation the system successfully acquires a chaotic end - state , facilitated by stochastic elimination of stable quasi - periodic trajectories throughout the evolutionary sequence .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the dynamical state as well as the formation scenario of a multi - resonant chain of planets residing in the gj876 system . in particular",
    ", we began our investigation by constructing a simplified model , based on hamiltonian perturbation theory , that broadly captures the dynamical behavior of the system . upon a detailed examination of this model , we considered the assembly of the multi - resonant system in presence of dissipative and stochastic forces .    with the tally of exoplanetary detections now in excess of a thousand @xcite",
    ", it is tempting to question the value held in detailed examination of the orbital architecture of a particular system .",
    "while such criticism may be appropriate for bodies whose overall state is reminiscent of other well - characterized exoplanets ,",
    "the gj876 system easily escapes such scrutiny as it clearly stands out as a unique member of the observational aggregate . to this end , the gj876  c - b - e \" system represents the only known extrasolar laplace - like resonance . unlike the the galilean satellites however , the gj876 multi - resonant system is vigorously chaotic , with a characteristic decoherence time on the order of a decade .",
    "the primary difference between the two configurations stems from the high eccentricities attained by the massive planets in the gj876 system and the fact that the resonant libration amplitudes associated with planet  e \" never approached near - null values . while interesting in its own right , the nature of the gj876 resonance plays an important additional role as a means of placing much - needed constraints on the nature of the protoplanetary disk from which the system emerged .",
    "the characterization of the stability , dynamical structure , and origins of the laplace resonance inherent to the galilean satellites ( within a tangible framework ) is among the most widely - celebrated achievements of celestial mechanics of the latter half of the 20th century ( see @xcite for reviews ) . as we have shown here , the fiercely chaotic laplace - like resonance of the gj876 system",
    "can also be understood within the context of a simple time - independent perturbative model , characterized by two degrees of freedom .",
    "specifically , the mathematical formulation of the governing hamiltonian is analogous to a pair of momentum - coupled pendulums . while in agreement with direct numerical integration ( @xcite ) , this model clearly illuminates the origins of stochastic motion and allows one to derive simple analytic estimates of the lyapunov time and action diffusion coefficient related to the outer - most planet s eccentricity @xcite .",
    "given the system s short ( @xmath156 decadal ) timescale for stochastic excursions ( implied by the analytical estimates and observed in the numerical simulations ) , one may readily expect the associated quasi - random signal to become evident in the observational radial velocity time series of the system .",
    "specifically , one may naively expect that the individual lines observed on the periodogram will be chaotically broadened @xcite .",
    "this consideration may place fundamental limits on any dynamical model s ability to match the observed signal , even provided an outstanding signal to noise ratio ( see @xcite ) . in practice , however , the chaotic nature of the orbits is probably not the dominant source of error in the data @xcite and likely leads to a limited reduction in the goodness of fit @xcite .",
    "a crucial feature that arises naturally within the context of the developed framework is the simultaneous rapidity of the chaotic loss of dynamical memory and long - term stability .",
    "this characteristic contrasts the de - populated mean motion resonances ( kirkwood gaps ) within the asteroid belt @xcite but bears some resemblance to the long - term stability of the planets of the solar system @xcite .",

    "@xcite have shown that mercury s secular evolution can be understood within the context of an autonomous hamiltonian corresponding to a pair of momentum - coupled pendulums ( see also @xcite ) , much like the case of the resonant evolution of gj876  e \" .",
    "furthermore , in direct correspondence to the stability of gj876 , @xcite have recently shown that mercury s long - term stability also arises from a topological boundary associated with the approximate conservation of the hamiltonian itself ( see poincar@xmath25  surfaces of section depicted in figure [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the formation of the gj876 multi - resonant chain almost certainly requires convergent approach of the orbits facilitated disk - driven migration . while a perfectly laminar evolutionary track had previously been invoked to explain the ( nearly periodic ) ",
    "c - b \" mean motion resonance ( see @xcite as well numerous other references quoted above ) , our modeling suggests that a chaotic configuration is incompatible with formation in a purely dissipative nebular environment .",
    "instead , limited stochastic perturbations arising from turbulent forcing @xcite appear to be needed to explain the observed configuration .",
    "accordingly , we utilized our perturbative model to survey a range of assumed disk parameters with an eye towards identifying a regime that leads to a successful formation of a chaotic multi - resonant chain .",
    "this allowed us to statistically infer ( albeit within the framework of an approximate model ) the likely combination of relative strengths of turbulent perturbations and dissipative effects inherent to the gj876 protoplanetary disk .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless quantity derived in section ( 4.2 ) is related to the turbulent schmidt number of the disk .",
    "although parameters of this sort are of great importance for the quantification of angular momentum transport within disks @xcite , their observational characterization is at present scarce @xcite .",
    "thus , theoretical considerations such as that undertaken in this work are required to inform the relevant characteristics . systems such as gj876 provide a rare opportunity to perform such an analysis .",
    "accordingly , a viable and consequential extension of the presented work would involve direct magnetohydrodynamic modeling of the assembly of the gj876 multi resonant system within its natal disk ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such an investigation would no doubt further our understanding of typical formation environments of planetary systems and place additional constraints on the dominant processes involved in sculpting their orbital architectures ."

    "<S> , we present a simple perturbative model that illuminates the origins of stochasticity inherent to this system and derive analytic estimates of the lyapunov time as well as the chaotic diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> we then address the formation of the multi - resonant structure within a protoplanetary disk and show that modest turbulent forcing in addition to dissipative effects is required to reproduce the observed chaotic configuration . </S>",
