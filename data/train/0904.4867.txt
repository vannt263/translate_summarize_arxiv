    "it turns out , that the typical e - folding times for the energy release from helium burning become as low as hours at the peak of the flash , and therefore are comparable to convective turnover times .",
    "thus , the usual assumptions used in simple descriptions of convection in one - dimensional hydrostatic calculations ( e.g. instantaneous mixing ) do not have to be valid any longer .",

    "the resulting typical convective velocities are therefore much higher in 2d than in 3d ( fig.[mmocak.fig3 ] ) .",
    "the structural differences between 2d and 3d flows are clearly visible in the distribution of the kinetic flux across the convection zone ( fig.[mmocak.fig3 ] ) .",
    "the typical evolved 2d flows contain well defined vortices ( fig.[mmocak.fig2 ] ) with their central regions never interacting with the region of the dominant nuclear burning above the @xmath23 .",
    "this results in a reduced kinetic flux between @xmath31 r @xmath32 , since the gas in that region , on average , is located at bottom of convective vortices , and thus does not experience any strong radial flow . on the other hand , the distribution of the kinetic flux in 3d is rather smooth , and the flow structures tend to be also smaller than in 2d .",

    "the 2d structures ( vortices ) have an angular size of around @xmath33 .",
    "the structures in the 3d are column shaped , with a smaller angular size",
    ". the convective and kinetic flux is lower in 3d than in the 2d , but the total energy production is about 20 % higher in 3d ( because no symmetry restrictions are imposed , and due to the strong dependence of the triple-@xmath15 reaction rate on the temperature ) .",
    "the convective and kinetic flux carry together more than 90 % of the energy produced by the burning .",
    "the 3d velocities qualitatively match the velocities predicted by the mixing - length theory better than in 2d , where the velocities are clearly overestimated .",
    "figure[mmocak.fig3 ] shows that they also depend on resolution , being higher in the simulation with the highest resolution .",
    "the extent of the convection zone increases with time .",
    "due to turbulent entrainment ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* meakin & arnett 2007 ) ) , convective boundaries defined by the schwarzschild criterium are pushed towards the center of the star , and towards the stellar surface , respectively ( fig.[mmocak.fig3 ] ) .",
    "this is in contradiction with the predictions made by ( 1d ) hydrostatic stellar modeling .",
    "for ilustration , the temporal evolution of the location of the outer convective boundary is depicted in figure[mmocak.fig3 ] .",
    "it is defined as the radius , where the mean carbon abundance x(@xmath10c)@xmath34 0.002 .",
    "the rapid initial jump of the boundary position to r @xmath35 at about @xmath28 1200 s is due to the first touch of the convective flow on the boundary .",
    "later entrainment is rather steady .",
    "the velocity of the outer boundary ( entrainment rate ) in our models are listed in table[mmocak.modtab ] .",
    "the entrainment involves a few radial zones only over the longest simulation we have performed .",
    "although the @xmath10c abundance distribution stayed discontinuous at boundaries ( no evident effect of numerical diffusion is detected ) , the entrainment rates presented here have to be considered as an order of magnitude estimate only .",
    "the entrainment at the inner convective boundary occurs with a rate much smaller than at the outer convective boundary .",

    "the downflows cover a much bigger volume in the convection zone than the upflows .",
    "the downflows dominate more in 3d .",
    "interestingly , the kinetic flux is always positive in both cases , although the downflows fill almost the whole convection zone .",
    "this implies that the downflows are much slower then the upflows .",
    "the expansion velocities v@xmath38 are in good agreement with those of initial stellar model only in the 2d model with highest resolution dv4 ( fig.[mmocak.fig3 ] ) .",
    "the expansion in the low resolution models does not match at all .",
    "due to the different dynamic properties of the flow in the less resolved models , the spherical mass flow is weaker .",
    "mixing at the convective boundaries and across the convection zone in 2d and 3d is quite different as well . in 2d , due to the symmetry restriction , every turbulent feature is in fact an annulus .",
    "hence , turbulence and mixing can be properly modelled only by means of 3d simulations .",
