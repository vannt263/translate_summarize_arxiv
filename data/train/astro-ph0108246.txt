    "( 1981 ) to differentiate wolf - rayet central stars from massive central stars . ]",
    "central stars of planetary nebulae ( pn ) are hydrogen - deficient central stars that exhibit emission line spectra very similar to massive wolf - rayet stars . until recently it has been impossible to calculate stellar evolutionary models where the star eliminates all of its hydrogen - rich envelop at the top of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "this prompted the association of these objects with the born - again scenario ( iben et al .",
    "1983 ) , whereby a white dwarf experiences a last helium shell flash , after which it rejoins the tip of the agb for a second time and repeats its evolution , this time as a hydrogen - deficient central star .",
    "the pn around [ wc ] central stars do not appear to have any characteristics which distinguish them from the pn of hydrogen - rich central stars .",
    "a marginally higher nebular c / h ratio ( de marco & barlow 2001 ) , as well as a slightly higher pn expansion velocity ( gorny & stasinska 1995 ) , do not appear to be sufficient to characterise the sample s evolution .",
    "other puzzling peculiarities concern spectral appearance differences amongst members of the hydrogen - deficient central star group .",
    "some hydrogen deficient central stars appear to have weaker lines than others ( called _ weak emission lines stars _",
    "( _ wels _ ) by tylenda , acker & stenholm ( 1993 ) ) , while in the strong - lined [ wc ] group , there appears to be a classification gap , with [ wc ] stars populating the [ wc11 - 8 ] class ( called [ wcl ] ) and [ wc5-wo1 ] ( called [ wce ] ; pottasch 1996 , crowther , de marco & barlow 1998 ) . additionally , while it is currently believed that [ wcl ] stars evolve into [ wce ] stars , the stellar abundances seem to differ in the two groups , with the more evolved group having a lower carbon abundance than the less evolved group ( see de marco & barlow ( 2001 ) for a summary of results from the literature ) , a fact that can not be easily explained .",
    "on the other hand , infrared space observatory ( iso ) spectroscopy of pn with [ wcl ] central stars has shown that all have crystalline silicate features in their mid- to far - infrared spectra , in addition to the previously known carbon - rich pah - type features that dominate their mid - infrared spectra , betraying the simultaneous presence of both carbon - rich and oxygen - rich dust ( see barlow 1997 , waters et al .",
    "1998 , cohen et al . 1999 ,",
    "cohen 2001 ) .",
    "the relatively warm temperatures deduced for the o - rich dust , together with the high nebular densities of their compact nebulae , appear to imply that the c - rich central stars evolved relatively recently from an o - rich composition .",
    "this would in turn suggest that these [ wcl ] pn have been on the agb recently and so did not result from a born - again evolutionary phase , for which low - density nebulae are expected .",
    "this would also imply that the carbon - rich [ wcl ] stars systematically result from oxygen - rich agb giants .",
    "recent improvements in theoretical stellar evolutionary calculations have succeeded in eliminating hydrogen from the stellar atmosphere at the tip of the agb , so that the requirement that the central star undergo a born - again event in order to get rid of its hydrogen is no longer in place . according to herwig ( 2000 ) a thermal pulse",
    "just before the star departs from the agb can eliminate most of the hydrogen , while a well - timed post - agb pulse ( probabilistically rarer ) could account for the extreme hydrogen deficiency observed in [ wcl ] stars .",
    "the combination of the iso observations and the new evolutionary calculations therefore contributes to the revision of theories about the origin of [ wcl ] central stars and for the first time we may have a viable scenario that does not require the star to go through a born - again episode .",
    "the pn swst  1 around the central star hd  167362 ( we will give both star and nebula the name swst  1 ) exhibits a broad 10@xmath0 m silicate emission feature ( aitken & roche 1982 ) and has been suggested to be amongst the youngest of [ wcl ] nebulae , possibly having experienced the transition from the agb in the last century .",
    "the spectrum of swst  1 was first reported by fleming ( 1895 ) , but the first complete spectroscopic analysis was carried out by swings and struve ( 1940 , 1943 ) .",
    "the traditional wr c  iv @xmath135806/c  iii @xmath135696 line diagnostic ratio positions it within the [ wc9 ] spectral class ( crowther et al .",
    "1998 - see also previous classifications by cohen ( 1975 ) and by carlson and henize ( 1979 ) ) , but the weakness of its lines compared to other [ wc9 ] stars ( e.g. bd+303639 , he  2 - 99 ) or even cooler [ wc10 ] stars ( e.g. cpd56@xmath148032 , he  2 - 113 , m  4 - 18 ) prompted crowther et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to flag it as _ peculiar _ and has therefore essentially left it in a class of its own .",
    "tylenda et al . (",
    "1993 ) listed it amongst their _ wels _ because of the weakness of its spectral lines , but swst  1 does not resemble stars in this class either ( e.g. cn  3 - 1 , de marco 2000 ) since it has many more stellar emission features than any _ wels _ , indicative of a denser wind .    in this paper we tried to determine whether the physical characteristics of the central star and the pn can shed light on the reason for these differences , i.e. whether swst  1 is at an intermediate phase between stars in the [ wcl ] class and their ancestors . in the sections that follow we present optical echelle spectra , near - infrared spectra and archival iue spectra , as well as hst images of this central star and its pn .",
    "using these data we carry out a thorough analysis , to try and single out the peculiarities of this object . in section  2",
    "we present our observational data , while in section  3 we derive some observational parameters .",
    "the distance , luminosity and mass are discussed in section  4 .",
    "the stellar analysis is tackled in section  5 , while the nebular analysis is carried out in sections  6 to 8 .",
    "finally ( section  9 ) a review of the secular variability is reported and conclusions are drawn in section  10 .",
    "swst  1 was observed with the 3.9  m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) on may 14 and 15 , 1993 , using the 31.6 l / mm grating of the ucl echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) , with a 1024@xmath151024 pixel tektronix ccd as detector .",
    "four settings of the ccd were needed in order to obtain spectral coverage in the range 36009700   . at each wavelength setting , 5  arcsec wide - slit spectra were obtained for absolute spectro - photometry , while 1.5  arcsec narrow  slit spectra ( r=50,000 ) were obtained for maximum resolution in the range 41005400  ",
    ". the continuum signal - to - noise ratio of the averaged exposures ranges from @xmath165 in the far blue to @xmath1630 in the red .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table  [ tab : aat93_log ] .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf ( v2.10 ) package at the ucl starlink node .",
    "wavelength calibration was with respect to comparison th - ar arc exposures .",
    "absolute flux calibration was with respect to the b3iv star hd  60753 , whose energy distribution has been measured by oke ( 1992 ) .",
    "details of the laborious echelle data flux calibration procedure can be found in de marco , barlow & storey ( 1997 ; hereafter dbs97 ) .",
    "subsequent data reduction was carried out with the starlink dipso package ( howarth et al .",
    "after flux calibration , the narrow  slit spectra were scaled up to the continuum level of the wide  slit spectra ."
