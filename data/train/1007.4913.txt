    "group iv transition metals such as titanium , zirconium , and hafnium have wide applications in the aerospace , nuclear , and biomedical industry @xcite . the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) type ( @xmath2 phase ) of ti and zr alloys in usage as metallic biomaterial",
    "have been studied extensively because of their properties of nontoxicity , high strength , good biocompatibility , and low elastic modulus @xcite . however , the investigations of the single crystal @xmath2 zr as biomaterial has not been reported .",
    "actually , at ambient condition zr crystallizes in hexagonal closed - packed ( hcp ) structure ( @xmath0 phase ) .",
    "and at high temperature of 1135 k , it transforms into the @xmath2 phase . at room temperature and under pressure range of 2 - 7 gpa @xcite",
    ", the @xmath0 phase transforms to another more open hexagonal structure of @xmath1 phase with space group _ p6/mmm _ ( no . 191 ) . and under further high pressure of 30 - 35 gpa , the @xmath1@xmath9@xmath2 phase transition has been observed @xcite",
    ". the young s moduli of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases at ambient condition are largely bigger than that of a human bone ( about 30 gpa ) .",
    "so the condition of low elastic modulus can not be satisfied for these two phases . as for @xmath2 phase",
    ", it can not be exploited because the reverse phase transformations take place upon unloading .",
    "so it seems that we should not consider metal zr as candidate biomaterial .",
    "but , fortunately recent experiment has successfully stabilized the @xmath2 zr at room temperature using compression stresses higher than 3 gpa plus the controlled application of shear @xcite",
    ". this makes stabilizing the high temperature or pressure phases of zr at ambient conditions reality .",
    "therefore , the study of the elastic modulus for @xmath2 zr at low pressure is valuable .    as another key objective of our work ,",
    "we calculate the superconducting transition temperature @xmath10@xmath11 for metal zr .",
    "although the @xmath10@xmath11 of zr has been observed in experiments @xcite , to date no theoretical work is found in the literature .",
    "our calculations will show that the increase ( decrease ) in @xmath10@xmath11 with pressure can be understood in terms of the enhancement ( reduction ) of the electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level and the corresponding behaviors of electron - phonon coupling constant .",
    "in present study , the dynamic stability of @xmath2 zr is tested carefully by performing phonon dispersion calculations .",

    "in contrast , total @xmath4(__e__@xmath5 ) of @xmath2 zr decreases with pressure in the whole domain of 26 - 60 gpa .",
    "all these pressure - dependent behaviors of @xmath4(__e__@xmath5 ) obey one known fact that a more stable phase has a lower value of @xmath4(__e__@xmath5 ) . through plotting partial @xmath4(__e__@xmath5 ) of @xmath17 , @xmath20 , and @xmath15 orbitals ( not shown ) , we find that the main contribution to the pressure - dependent behavior of the total @xmath4(__e__@xmath5 ) comes from @xmath15 orbital .",

    "[ dos ] , one can see that the experimental @xmath8 changes in almost the same way as that of the @xmath4(__e__@xmath5 ) .",
    "so , it seems that relative larger value of the @xmath4(__e__@xmath5 ) for @xmath2 zr at 26 gpa may predict larger @xmath8 for superconductivity .",

    "the increasing behavior of @xmath8 upon compression is mainly due to the increase of @xmath3 . for @xmath2 zr",
    ", @xmath49 and @xmath3 have an almost opposite evolution with pressure .",
    "however , the changing rate for @xmath49 and @xmath3 is different .",
    "the increasing rate of @xmath49 is clearly larger than the decreasing rate of @xmath3 in pressure range of 26 to 30 gpa .",
    "after being compressed over 30 gpa , the decreasing rate of @xmath3 exceeds the increasing rate of @xmath49 .",
    "so the main affection to the pressure performance of @xmath8 comes from the increase of @xmath49 in pressure domain 26 - 30 gpa , while in 30 - 60 gpa is from the decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the relatively small value of @xmath8 at 26 gpa for @xmath2 zr is understandable .",
    "furthermore , the lowest transverse - acoustics ( ta1 ) soft mode for bcc @xmath2 zr in pressure range of 26 - 30 gpa is evident [ fig .",
    "[ phonon](b ) ] and can lead a significant electron - phonon contribution .",
    "therefore , as indicated in table [ superconductivity ] , the epc constant @xmath3 at 26 - 30 gpa is predominantly larger than that of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases . and , along with increasing the pressure",
    ", soft vibrational mode for @xmath2 zr gradually fade away , resulting in the decrease of @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the decrease of @xmath3 and @xmath8 for @xmath2 zr under pressure mainly originates from the fading of soft vibrational modes induced by increasing pressure .",
    "in summary , the elasticity , dynamic properties , and superconductivity of zr under pressure up to 60 gpa have been studied by means of the first - principles dft - pbe method .",
    "our results have shown that the structural parameters , elastic constants , elastic moduli , poisson s ratio , ultrasonic velocities , and debye temperature of @xmath0 and @xmath1 phases coincide well with experiments .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath9@xmath1 and @xmath1@xmath9@xmath2 phase transition pressures at @xmath10=0 k have been calculated to be @xmath303.7 gpa and 32.4 gpa , respectively .",
    "the compression curve of @xmath2 zr is well consistent with experiments .",
    "our calculations have explicitly indicated that the low elastic modulus of zr occurs at low pressure in @xmath2 phase .    in phonon dispersion study , the soft modes of @xmath2 phase along [ 111 ] and [ 110 ] directions have been shown and the @xmath2@xmath9@xmath1 and @xmath2@xmath9@xmath0 transition paths have been predicted .",
    "dynamic stability test has illustrated that @xmath2 zr is unstable till being compressed over 25 gpa .",
    "in addition , superconductivity has been obtained by electron - phonon coupling calculations and our calculated @xmath8 accords well with experiments . through analyzing the electronic density of states at the fermi level ,",
    "we have derived that the main contribution to the pressure - dependent behavior of the superconductivity comes from the @xmath15 orbital .",
    "the large @xmath8 at around 30 gpa for @xmath2 zr is mainly due to the ta1 soft mode . under pressure ,",
