    "kondo insulators as well as heavy fermion materials @xcite are believed to be described by kondo lattice models with antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath0 and hopping @xmath1 . in this framework",
    ", the kondo insulator - exemplified by ce@xmath4bi@xmath5pt@xmath4 - corresponds to a special band filling in which there is exactly one conduction electron per impurity spin .",
    "the origin of the charge and spin gaps is easy to understand in the limit of large @xmath6 where each conduction electron is trapped by an impurity spin to form a kondo singlet . starting from this point there are two ways of generating metallic states which will described the heavy electron state . on one hand",
    ", one can remove conduction electrons thus leaving uncompensated impurity spins . in the limit",
    "@xmath7 the problem maps onto the @xmath8 hubbard model where the kondo singlets are represented by empty sites and the bachelor - or unscreened - spins by electrons @xcite .",
    "thus , a metallic state is expected . on the other hand",
    "one can keep the number of conduction electrons constant and deplete the lattice of impurity spins . starting from ce@xmath4bi@xmath5pt@xmath4 this",
    "amounts to replacing ce by la @xcite .",
    "each missing impurity spin liberates a conduction electron .",
    "as can be seen easily in the strong coupling limit this conduction electron is localized since its motion involves the breaking of adjacent kondo singlets . hence a bound state with magnetic properties appears within the gap @xcite .",
    "if the depletion is _ large _ enough the induced localized levels may overlap coherently to form a metallic state .",
    "alternatively this metallic state where there are more conduction electrons than impurity spins may be viewed as evolving from dilute impurity limit as realized for example in ce@xmath9la@xmath10cu@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "note however that in the small ( large ) @xmath12 limit the ce ( la ) atoms are randomly substituted for la ( ce ) in the lacu@xmath11 ( cecu@xmath11 ) crystal structure .    in the next section ,",
    "we first consider within a mean - field approximation @xcite both above describe routes to obtain metallic states .",
    "the paramagnetic solution of this mean - field approximation is nothing but the large - n ( n corresponds to the su(n ) symmetry of the impurity spins ) saddle point @xcite .",
    "here , we concentrate on a special choice of depletion scheme for the localized spins .",
    "three out of four impurity spins are removed in a regular way thus ensuring that in the limit @xmath13 the ground state is metallic . at the mean - field level both routes to obtain a metallic state ( doping and above describe depletion scheme ) lead to the same metallic ground state : a fermi - liquid with arbitrarily large effective mass ( or arbitrarily low coherence temperature ) as the coupling @xmath6 is reduced .",
    "the mean - field solution has several pitfalls .",
    "for instance , the imaginary part of the self - energy vanishes at all temperatures , the kondo scale corresponds to a phase transition rather than to a crossover scale and charge fluctuations on impurity sites are allowed since constraints are imposed only on average",
    ".    for depleted kondo lattices it is possible to carry out auxiliary field quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations without encountering the infamous sign problem .",
    "this comes with the restriction of particle - hole symmetry for the conduction band .",
    "nevertheless this gives us the opportunity to compare _ exact _ results with mean - field approximations .",
    "there are two challenges to circumvent before achieving good results .",
    "the first one is the implementation of the exchange interaction @xmath0 along with the constraint of singly occupied impurity sites .",
    "this problem has been solved in @xcite and extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "the second challenge lies in controlling finite size effects stemming from the conduction electrons .",
    "this is extremely important in the framework of kondo physics since screening takes place on an energy scale set by the kondo temperature @xmath14 which is exponentially small in the weak coupling limit .",
    "if the level spacing of the conduction electrons exceeds this small energy scale , finite size effect will dominate the result . in section [ sizeb.chap ]",
    "we present a simple method to reduce by up to an order magnitude in temperature the onset of size effects in thermodynamic quantities ( specific heat , spin and charge susceptibilities ) for a given lattice size .",
    "section [ qmc_res ] summarizes our numerical results .",
    "ground state , thermodynamic and transport properties are computed on lattice sizes up to 500 sites .",
    "we show that our simulations reproduce the typical form of the resistivity versus temperature curve observed in heavy fermion materials : an initial rise as a function of decreasing temperature originating from the onset of screening of the magnetic impurities then followed by a sharp downturn signaling the onset of coherence between individual screening clouds .",
    "energy scales as a function of coupling strength are computed .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions and discussion of our results .",
    "our starting point is the two - dimensional kondo lattice model ( klm ) : @xmath15 here @xmath16 runs over the lattice sites of a two dimensional square lattice : @xmath17 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 the lattice vectors .",
    "the set of lattice points @xmath20 denote the positions of impurity spins .",
    "@xmath21 creates a conduction electron on site @xmath22 with z - component of spin @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the spin 1/2 operators with @xmath25 the pauli spin matrices .",
    "a similar definition holds for @xmath26 . since the klm stems from the strong coupling limit of the periodic anderson model @xcite the charge degrees of freedom on the f - sites",
    "are frozen .",
    "hence , a constraint of one electron per @xmath27-site holds for klm .    in the notation of eq .",
    "[ klm_ham ] the usual klm model is obtained when @xmath28 ( see fig .",

    "as mentioned previously , in the strong coupling limit the klm with band filling @xmath39 maps onto the @xmath40 hubbard model with band filling @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the nature of the metallic state is not clear due to the strong correlations .",
    "however for fillings far from the doping induced mott metal - insulator transition , @xmath42 , it is reasonable to believe that beyond the one - dimensional case the ground state is a fermi liquid as described for example by a gutzwiller approximation . due to the special choice of the depletion ,",

    "we now concentrate on another important issue , size effects , which become extremely severe when one wishes to study metallic states down to low temperatures .",
    "finally , to determine the single impurity kondo scale for our given band - structure , we have used the hirsch - fye impurity algorithm @xcite . the same formulation as the lattice problem is readily implemented in this approach .",
    "reducing size effects in numerical simulations is important , since many models of correlated electron systems may be solved numerically only on _ small _ lattices .",
    "size effects become particularly severe when the ground state turns out be be a metallic state with large coherence temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "insulators are characterized by the localization of the wave function and are hence rather insensitive to boundary conditions on finite sized systems .",
    "it thus becomes apparent , that the worst case scenario for severe size effects are just free electrons in a tight binding approximation : @xmath84 in many cases before turning on the interaction which will automatically restrict the size of the lattice under consideration it is important to control size effects for this simple case .",
