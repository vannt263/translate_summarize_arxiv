    "stellar jets are an integral part of star formation during the first few million years when an accretion disk is present around young stars . how disks generate these highly collimated supersonic flows",
    "is a subject of much current observational and theoretical work .",
    "most models drive jets magnetically from the rotating disk or from the point where the stellar field intersects the inner disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there is some evidence that magnetic fields are strong enough within a few hundred au of the star to affect the flows @xcite .",
    "the location where the disk launches material into a jet varies between models , and observations are just now getting to the point where they can provide useful constraints on this process ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the broad goal for observational work related to launching and collimating jets is to constrain the basic input parameters assumed by the models .",
    "main outstanding questions involve understanding how disks accelerate material into jets , how jets become heated , and what role magnetic fields play in the flow dynamics . to answer these questions",
    "requires observations as close as possible to the star , because as the flow evolves velocity variability in the jet creates internal bow shocks that dominate the heating and complicate the internal dynamics .",
    "if we wish to infer the shapes of streamlines and the location and strength of shock waves , and detect any rotational component to the outflow we must measure precise radial velocities and resolve emission line widths down to the thermal broadening limit .",
    "the observations described above are near or beyond the capabilities of existing facilities .",
    "the closest bright stellar jets are @xmath1 140  pc away , so to study these systems on scales of 10  au requires spatial resolutions @xmath2 0.1@xmath3 .",
    "the strongest emission lines from jets are those in the optical ( [ s  ii ] , [ n  ii ] , [ o  i ] , h@xmath4 , etc ) . however , in the optical , the required spatial resolution is available only from hst , and unfortunately current hst instrumentation delivers only moderate spectral resolution which fails to reach the thermal broadening limit by a factor of five or more .",
    "the only atomic near - infrared lines of note in stellar jets are fe [ ii ] 1.644 @xmath5 m and 1.667 @xmath5 m .",
    "ground - based adaptive optics systems on large telescopes reach the required spatial resolution and possess instruments that also deliver the necessary spectral resolution to study these lines in a few of the brightest jets .",
    "it is also becoming possible to study molecular jets close to their sources using radio interferometric observations of sio ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    because it is bright , relatively close ( @xmath1 140 pc ) , and visible all the way to the star ,",
    "the rw aur jet is one of the best targets in the sky to study how accretion disks launch jets .",
    "rw  aur was discovered as a variable star a little over a century ago @xcite , and is well - known as having a rich emission line spectrum in the optical characteristic of a high - accretion rate classical t  tauri star @xcite .",
    "the system is also a binary , with a companion located @xmath1 1.4@xmath3 from the primary @xcite .",
    "the jet has both redshifted and blueshifted components , with the redshifted part having higher radial velocity @xcite .",
    "the jet and its bow shocks extend from the star for at least 100@xmath3 @xcite , and proper motions show the jet to be inclined 46 degrees to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "several studies of rw aur have focused on the properties of its jet on subarcsecond scales as it emerges from the source .",
    "high - resolution optical images of [ o  i ] and [ s  ii ] traced the jet to within @xmath1 0.3 arcseconds , of the star @xcite , and showed that it has a roughly constant opening angle of 3.9@xmath6 .",
    "the jet does not project back to a point at the star , indicating that the opening angle is wider within 30  au of the source .",
    "spectra of the jet from stis on hst show that the density declines with distance from the star as the jet expands , and that the velocity asymmetry between the redshifted and blueshifted jets has increased over the last decade @xcite .",
    "emission - line spectroastrometry provides evidence for outflows on au scales @xcite , and",
    "the variability of high - velocity components of semiforbidden uv lines also implies a wind close to the star @xcite , consistent with recent models of the balmer line profiles @xcite .",
    "an intriguing observation of asymmetry in the velocity structure of the jet has been interpreted as evidence for rotation @xcite . however , these observations are controversial because the modest spectral resolution of stis ( 55 km@xmath7s@xmath8 ) makes it very difficult to infer rotational velocities of only a few km@xmath7s@xmath8 , and in the case of rw  aur the molecular disk rotates in the opposite sense of the inferred jet rotation @xcite .",
    "precession can also mimic rotation signatures in outflows @xcite .",
    "two high - spectral resolution studies of the infrared [ fe  ii ] lines in rw  aur have been done .",
    "@xcite used an echelle with 19 km@xmath7s@xmath8 resolution and a wide slit without adaptive optics to resolve the line widths in the redshifted and blueshifted jets .",
    "more recently , @xcite used adaptive optics with the subaru telescope with 0.2@xmath3 resolution , a 0.3@xmath3 wide slit and 30 km@xmath7s@xmath8 velocity resolution to study the kinematics of the jet down to @xmath1 30  au from the source .",
    "such observations provide important constraints on models of jet collimation and energetics .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the first high resolution adaptive optics observations of a stellar jet taken with the near - ir spectrometer on keck .",
    "these observations represent a significant improvement in the spatial and spectral resolution over previous studies - a factor of @xmath1 3 better spectral resolution and 20% better spatial resolution than the hst stis data , and a factor of 1.5 and 3 better spectral and spatial resolution , respectively , than the subaru spectra .",
    "in addition , the slit width of 0.068@xmath3 is @xmath1 4 times narrower than that of the subaru spectra , so we can isolate a slim cross section of the jet .",
    "both the spatial and spectral dimensions are subsampled a factor of @xmath1 4 better than those of stis , which enables more precise subtraction of the stellar psf close to the star .",
    "the cost to pay for such high spatial and spectral resolution and a very narrow slit is a reduction in flux .",
    "we were unable to detect the fainter extended emission away from the axis of the rw aur jet , and thus can not address issues related to rotation .",
    "however , our observations clearly resolve the line widths and velocities in the jet for the first time to within 10 au of the star .",
    "the narrow slit provides a sharp ` cut ' down the axis of the flow which is easy to interpret , and makes it possible to measure the geometry of the streamlines as the jet emerges from the disk .",
    "we obtained spectra of the rw aur jet with the nirspec spectrograph and adaptive optics system attached to the w.  m.  keck  ii telescope on mauna kea on 17 dec 2006 ut . the position angle of the slit was 125 degrees ( along the axis of the jet ) , and the ao system used the target , rw aur , as a natural guide star ( r magnitude @xmath1 10 ) .",
    "the slit width was 68 mas , which projects to a distance of only 9.5  au at the distance to the object of 140  pc , so these observations represent narrow slices down the axis of the flow .",
    "spectra include seven orders from 1.51 @xmath5 m through 1.74 @xmath5 m , with gaps of @xmath1 0.03 @xmath5 m where the spectra extend beyond the 1024@xmath91024 insb chip .",
    "the dispersion was 0.238   ( 4.34 km@xmath7s@xmath8 ) per pixel at the wavelength of the [ fe ii ] 1.644 @xmath5 m emission line .",
    "the velocity resolution of the instrument , defined by the fwhm of several oh night sky emission lines , was 20.3 km@xmath7s@xmath8 and remained constant throughout the night .",
    "the dispersion is about five times finer and the resolution about three times better than optical spectra of rw  aur obtained with stis on hst @xcite .",
    "wavelength shifts were less than 0.1 pixel between different sky spectra , so a single wavelength solution suffices for all spectra .",
    "we determined the wavelength scale from positions of oh emission lines in our night sky spectra @xcite , and from kr and ar lines in calibration lamp spectra .",
    "the number of lines per order is sparse , so uncertainties in the wavelength solutions are rather large , @xmath1 @xmath10 5 km@xmath7s@xmath8 for 1-sigma .",
    "the wavelength calibration is most uncertain at the edges of orders .",
    "this uncertainty affects the velocity zero point of our spectra but has a negligible effect on the line profile shape or the velocity dispersion .",
    "flatfields taken with the continuum lamp showed an irregular interference pattern that introduced spurious patterns to our data .",
    "the chip is quite flat , with variations in pixel - to - pixel sensitivity only 1%  @xmath0 2% , so in lieu of a continuum flat we used the dithers of the multiple exposures along the slit to remove pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "the psf is well - sampled both spatially and spectrally , further reducing the need for continuum flats .",
    "individual exposure times were five minutes in length .",
    "we initially acquired spectra in a grid centered on the rw  aur jet with offsets perpendicular to the axis of the jet at distances that ranged from @xmath00.204@xmath3 to @xmath110.204@xmath3 , spaced in intervals of one slit width , 0.068@xmath3 .",
    "however , observations with offsets from the axis @xmath12 0.1 arcsecond showed no signal from [ fe  ii ] so we resampled the interior part of the grid with 0.034@xmath3 spacings , and concentrated most of our spectra within @xmath10 0.1 arcsecond of the axis . in",
    "all , 27 exposures had some [ fe ii ] signal .",
    "nine additional spectra of blank sky taken throughout the night aided the wavelength calibration and background subtraction of oh night sky lines .    in practice ,",
    "small spatial offsets exist between the desired and actual slit positions .",
    "fortunately , these are easy to quantify with the 256x256 hgcdte slit camera ( scam ) images , which are taken simultaneously with the spectra .",
    "rw aur and rw aur / c appear on all scam images , and define the scam plate scale to be 16.3 mas per pixel , close to the value quoted by @xcite .",
    "the slit is visible on the scam images , and is 2.20@xmath3 in length . on the science camera , spectral images of the slit in the night",
    "sky emission lines subtend 118 pixels , so the plate scale of the longslit spectra is 18.6 mas per pixel .",
    "conditions were non - photometric , but scam images of rw aur / c show the ao system produced stellar images with fwhm of 60 @xmath10 13 mas at h throughout the night ( table  1 ) .",
    "this spatial resolution is about 20%  better than that obtained with optical diffraction - limited dithered hst slitless images of the hh  30 jet with stis @xcite , and a factor of three better than the subaru spectra of @xcite .",
    "while some previous observations have suggested that the companion may also be a binary , our observations show only a single star , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we combined the [ fe  ii ] spectra into five position - velocity diagrams as described in table  1 and fig .",
    "1 , using the position of rw aur / c in the scam images to define where the slit was positioned during each exposure . the scam images also show that there were shifts of up to 0.10 arcsecond along the slit , which we removed before averaging individual frames into the five output spectra , denoted 0.083-ne , 0.033-ne , center , 0.047-sw , and 0.089-sw . after subtracting a background sky image from each object and removing any remaining hot pixels",
    ", we extracted the order of interest and corrected the spectra for tilts in the x- and y - directions using the observed trace of the rw aur spectrum and the position of the night sky lines , respectively .",
    "the reduced data have spatial position along the y - axis and heliocentric radial velocity along the x - axis .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity of rw  aur is 14 @xmath10 5 km@xmath7s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the method we use to extract extended emission lines from longslit spectra is that of @xcite .",
    "briefly , the spatial psf of the star is defined by coadding the counts in a wavelength region on either side of the emission line , and the psf is interpolated linearly between these regions .",
    "once one obtains a spectrum at the location of the star , multiplying this spectrum by the spatial psf and subtracting it from the image leaves only the extended line emission . to obtain a stellar spectrum we split the spectrum into redshifted and blueshifted portions .",
    "the blueshifted flow occurs to the se , so for the blueshifted portion of the spectrum we extracted the stellar spectrum from the nw part of the stellar psf .",
    "similarly , the se part of the psf defined the spectrum of the redshifted portion of the spectrum .",
    "combining the two halves gives a position - velocity diagram for the extended line emission .",
    "the procedure is implemented through an imfort program in iraf .",
    "figure  1 shows that the position - velocity diagrams of the five positions are essentially identical .",
    "we could not detect any flux at distances greater than 0.1 arcsecond away from the axis of the flow . combining the ao - corrected fwhm of 60 mas in quadrature with the slit width of 68 mas we obtain @xmath1 90 mas for the expected spatial extent of an unresolved source .",
    "hence , our observations do not clearly resolve the spatial width of the jet .",
    "hst - stis spectra of [ s  ii ] with comparable spatial resolution to our spectra do resolve the jet spatially @xcite , but with a much lower spectral resolution .",
    "we measured the radial velocities and fwhm from each 5-minute exposure individually and combined the results to produce each point and errorbar in fig .  2 and fig .",
    "the velocity of the redshifted flow is almost a factor of two lower than that of the blueshifted flow , as observed already by @xcite , and by @xcite .",
    "the combination of exquisite spatial and spectral resolution of the keck ao system reveals that the radial velocity of the redshifted [ fe ii ] decreases in the first 0.2@xmath3 , and then stays constant .",
    "the redshifted emission is slower , brighter , and more peaked in velocity than the blueshifted emission .",
    "3 shows that the [ fe  ii ] line is well - resolved spectrally , and its width increases monotonically in both the jet and the counterjet as the distance to the source decreases .",
    "the blueshifted flow has a linewidth about 50%  larger than its redshifted counterpart .",
    "the larger linewidth of the blueshifted flow was noted before by @xcite , though that work did not have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to detect the rise of linewidth within @xmath1 30  au of the source within the redshifted jet .",
    "rw  aur has many permitted emission lines in its spectrum @xcite , and several of the brackett lines appear in our observations . a good way to determine whether or not these lines have a wind component is to perform spectroastrometry , which determines spatial offsets of the emission lines with respect to the adjacent continuum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the method is powerful because it is very sensitive to small positional shifts and can be done as a function of velocity for resolved emission lines , it suffers from the important limitation that the weighted average of the line emission at a given velocity determines the amount of the spatial shift .",
    "hence , if , for example , a blueshifted part of the line profile has a centroid shifted 2  au from the star , there need not be any emission at 2  au .",
    "such a shift only implies that the weighted average of the emission from the star and in the flow is offset from the stellar position by 2  au at that radial velocity .",
    "4 presents spectroastrometry in the vicinity of the bright brackett and [ fe  ii ] lines .",
    "the spectra show no indications of any wind signatures in br-12 or br-11 at the 0.04 pixel level ( @xmath1 0.1  au ) .",
    "however , both the [ fe  ii ] 1.644 @xmath5 m line and the much weaker [ fe  ii ] 1.677 @xmath5 m line exhibit clear redshifted and blueshifted astrometric signatures even though the line emission is dominated by photospheric and veiling flux at this wavelength .",
    "@xcite summarize three proposed geometries for magnetohydrodynamic jets in which open field lines are anchored to rotating young stellar objects .",
    "the models are all variations of the magnetocentrifugal mechanism @xcite , but differ in their mass loading : the disk wind model @xcite typically loads material over a wide range of radii ; the x - wind model @xcite drives the wind from a narrow range of radii ; and the hybrid stellar wind model @xcite emanates from latitudes between the base of the accretion column and the rotational pole . in each case",
    "the winds are accretion - powered and the models can be  cold \" or  warm \" depending on whether there is added thermal energy .",
    "ideally we would like to use the position - velocity diagrams in fig .  1 to test models of outflows directly .",
    "however , to do so requires that models accurately predict radiation from the [ fe  ii ] 1.644 @xmath5 m line , which in turn requires that the models incorporate all the important heating and cooling processes in their calculations and can predict the flux in this emission line .",
    "this is a tall order for any model , because time - variable phenomena such as internal velocity variability and magnetic reconnection appear to dominate the heating in jets within a few hundred au of the source .",
    "for example , recent hst observations of the physical conditions in the hh  30 jet show that it emerges mostly neutral , becomes ionized several tens of au from the source , and bright knots then move downstream in the flow @xcite . in rw",
    "aur there is a large velocity difference between the redshifted and blueshifted jets , with the redshifted jet the brighter of the two .",
    "steady - state , axially - symmetric models can not account for any of these phenomena , which ultimately determine how bright lines appear in position - velocity diagrams .",
    "reconnection geometries in stellar jets depend upon whether the magnetic axis of the disk aligns with that of the star @xcite , but detailed calculations of the position - velocities produced by this type of heating are lacking .",
    "hence , the most robust comparison we can make at present with model position - velocity diagrams is with the velocity extent of the line profile at various places along the jet .",
    "this comparison is not without flaws , because if the line does not emit in a particular part of the flow , as might occur if the gas was too cold there or had a different ionization state than the line of interest , then the line profile will not sample the kinematics of that region . in the case of the rw",
    "aur jet , the gas is unlikely to be fe  i , which is easily ionized , or more ionized than fe  ii because no other high ionization lines like [ o  iii ] exist close to the star .",
    "however , the near - ir [ fe  ii ] lines begin to become collisionally quenched when electron densities like those in the jet close to the source ( @xmath13@xmath14 ) are reached , and the emission will also decline if the gas cools below a few thousand kelvin .",
    "both the redshifted and blueshifted jets have similar appearances in the position - velocity diagram , in that the line profile is wider near the source and narrows with distance .",
    "this general behaviour occurs in all mhd launching scenarios as the jet becomes collimated , though , as expected , none of the models reproduce the bright knot located about 30  au from the source on both sides of the flow .",
    "one potential interesting constraint from fig .",
    "1 is that no blueshifted emission occurs on the redshifted side of the jet , and no redshifted emission exists on the blueshifted side .",
    "this is in conflict with at least one x - wind model @xcite , where a wide opening angle near the source produces a large radial velocity dispersion .",
    "however , this objection disappears if the jet is simply heated at a larger distance once the flow becomes more collimated .",
    "the x - wind model has a relatively narrow linewidth like that observed , but a disk wind can also produce similar linewidths , depending on the model parameters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as noted by previous authors ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) the fact that the redshifted jet is visible close to the star implies that the circumstellar disk does not block that portion of the flow .",
    "our spectra trace the redshifted jet to within @xmath1 10  au from the star , so using the known inclination i = 46@xmath6 for rw",
    "aur @xcite , any opaque disk can not extend beyond @xmath1 15  au from the star .",
    "this constraint does not seem particularly surprising , especially since rw  aur is a known binary and the companion could play a role in truncating the outer disk of the primary through dynamical interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as noted above , both the redshifted and blueshifted flows have what appears to be a bright knot at about 30  au from the source ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "without time - resolved observations we can not determine if these features are stationary , or , as typically seen in other flows ( e.g. hh  30 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , move with the jet .",
    "some of the decline of [ fe  ii ] flux close to the source on the redshifted side may be caused by the disk blocking our view .",
    "the knots are not accompanied by a sudden increase in linewidth , as one would expect for a strong bow shock , but these features could still represent shock waves if the shocks were planar because the curved nature of bow shocks is what produces large line widths .",
    "it is worth noting that this close to the source the magnetic field strength may be large enough to significantly inhibit shock formation from variable flow velocities @xcite , so the jet may be heated by other mechanisms such as magnetic waves or ambipolar diffusion at tens of au from the star .",
    "we can use the observed deconvolved line widths to infer something about the flow geometry , assuming radial flow ( rotation signatures are at most a few km@xmath7s@xmath8 , and thermal broadening for fe is also of this order ) .",
    "the ratio of the linewidth to the jet velocity is an easy dimensionless quantity to measure that depends on the flow geometry .",
    "the velocity along the axis of the jet is v@xmath15 = v@xmath16 / cos(i ) , where v@xmath16 is the observed radial velocity .",
    "the linewidth along a slice through the axis of the jet caused by streamlines that diverge at a full opening angle of @xmath17i is simply @xmath18v = v@xmath15 sin(i ) @xmath17i so that @xmath18v / v@xmath15 = sin(i ) @xmath17i . for rw",
    "aur , i = 46 @xmath6 , sin(i ) @xmath1 0.7 and @xmath17i @xmath1",
    "4@xmath6 so that @xmath18v / v@xmath15 @xmath1 0.05 . fig .",
    "5 shows that the observed value of @xmath18v / v@xmath15 ( corrected for instrumental resolution ) for both the redshifted and blueshifted portion of the flow is much larger , @xmath1 0.25 .",
    "hence , the large linewidth in the jet is dominated by different velocities within the slit and not by projection effects of an expanding radial flow with a single velocity .",
    "as noted above , the lack of correlation between intensity and line width suggests bow shocks play a minor role in altering the line width .    in the above calculation",
    "we have assumed 4@xmath6 as the opening angle , as observed by @xcite at distances down to 30  au from the source , about the location of peak redshifted and blueshifted emission in fig .  1 .",
    "at closer distances a larger opening angle would increase the linewidth for a radial flow . however , fig .",
    "1 shows that the linewidth increases only about 10% between 30  au and @xmath1 10  au , where the emission becomes lost in the stellar profile , so the effect of a larger opening angle on the linewidth between 30  au and 10  au appears to be negligible .",
    "this is not surprising , as there is no evidence for a larger opening angle in this distance range for other yso jets that have been observed with stis @xcite .    because the observations were taken with such a narrow slit , and no emission",
    "was observed away from the axis of the flow , the line emission we detect originates from @xmath1 14  au of the axis . according to fig .  5 , within this volume",
    "the velocity of the [ fe  ii ] emitting gas must change by @xmath1 25% . in a disk wind model",
    "the velocity would need to drop off quickly enough off - axis to produce this spread in line width .",
    "alternatively , if the jet is heated in some way by magnetic waves , then the line width should be on the order of the alfven speed in the jet .",
    "a density of @xmath19 @xmath14 and a linewidth of 70 km@xmath7s@xmath8 implies a field of @xmath1 10  mg if the broadening is purely magnetic",
    ". the alfvenic mach number of the flow tens of au from the star would be v@xmath15 / @xmath18v @xmath1 4 .",
    "5 shows two other interesting aspects of the flow .",
    "first , despite the large radial velocity differences between the redshifted and blueshifted jets , the ratio @xmath18v / v@xmath15 is remarkably similar between the two sides of the flow .",
    "second , there is a subtle , but significant trend that this ratio decreases with distance from the star .",
    "this decrease occurs because the linewidth drops more rapidly with distance ( fig .",
    "3 ) than the radial velocities do ( fig .  2 ) . in the context of pure magnetic heating",
    "this trend would imply a gradual increase of the magnetosonic mach number with distance , as one would expect if reconnection or ambipolar diffusion were responsible for heating the jet .",
    "our keck spectra of the rw  aur jet are a significant improvement in both spatial and spectral resolution over previous studies of any stellar jet .",
    "the jet was unresolved perpendicular to the flow , but the new spectra provide valuable information about the kinematics of the jet to within 10  au of the source .",
    "we confirm several features reported previously , including the velocity asymmetry and bright redshifted flow close to the source .",
    "our observations clearly show larger line widths close to the source for both the blueshifted and redshifted sides of the flow .",
    "the ratio of the line width to the jet velocity is about 0.25 for both sides of the flow , a factor of 5 greater than should occur from projection effects in a radial flow .",
    "the observed line widths could arise from a layered velocity structure in the jet or from magnetic waves .",
    "spectroastrometry shows no evidence for outflow in the upper brackett lines .",
    "the keck spectra illustrate what should become possible as instrumentation on large telescopes continues to improve .",
    "ideally one would like to have the same or better spectral and spatial resolution as these observations but with a system sensitive enough to detect emission away from the axis of the flow in order to address issues such as rotation and to better quantify the dynamics of the flow .",
    "time - resolved observations are also crucial for determining if the observed knots are stationary or move outward with the jet .",
    "if ao systems could be made to work in the optical where emission lines are bright and diagnostics are plentiful we could also learn a great deal about how jets are heated as they emerge from their disks .",

    "<S> our observations clearly show that both the radial velocities and the emission line widths are larger closer to the source on both sides of the jet . </S>",
    "<S> the line widths are 20%  @xmath0 30%  of the jet velocity on both sides of the flow , significantly larger than would be produced by a divergent constant velocity flow . </S>",
    "<S> the observed line widths could arise from a layered velocity structure in the jet or from magnetic waves . </S>",
    "<S> a bright knot in the redshifted jet has no concomitant increase in line width , implying that it is not heated by a bow shock . </S>",
    "<S> alternate heating mechanisms include planar shocks , ambipolar diffusion and magnetic reconnection . </S>"
