    "abell  3581 is a nearby ( @xmath1 ) , richness class 0 , cluster of galaxies .",
    "the central dominant galaxy ic  4374 has an extensive optical emission - line filament system ( @xcite , @xcite ) like that seen around the central galaxy in more massive clusters ( e.g. the perseus cluster , @xcite ) .",
    "abell  3581 was previously studied in x - rays , using data from the _ rosat _ and _ asca _ satellites by @xcite who found that it had a cool intracluster medium ( icm ) with @xmath2  kev , and a short radiative cooling time throughout its core .",
    "those data admitted a classical cooling flow with a significant amount of intrinsic absorption .",
    "recently , ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) it has been shown that clusters which have short central cooling times have much less gas at temperatures below about a third of the ambient cluster temperature compared with that expected from simple cooling . this inconsistency between theory and observations has led to the proposal of many different mechanisms to reheat the cooling gas .",
    "one popular subset of these heating models appeals to energy input from the active nucleus in the central dominant galaxy , which is usually found to harbour a radio source ( @xcite ) .    the central dominant galaxy in abell  3581 hosts the powerful radio source pks  1404 - 267 .",
    "since this is a cool cluster with a powerful radio source at its centre , it might be expected that if active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are able to heat the icm in clusters , this source might show the effects more clearly than richer clusters . however , although we will show that the icm does not have significant amounts of gas below a temperature of @xmath3  kev , there seems to be no other clear evidence for heating of the icm by the agn .",
    "we note that abell  3581 has a similar mean temperature and luminosity to the cluster abell  1983 which was recently studied with _",
    "xmm - newton _ by @xcite .",
    "the properties of the inner core of abell  3581 are however quite different from those of abell  1983 .",
    "we present a _ chandra _ observation ( obsid : 1650 , sequence number : 800118 ) of the cool cluster abell  3581 which was made on 2001 june 7 with the s3 back - illuminated detector in the acis - s instrument .",
    "data processing has been done using the ciao package available from the _ chandra _ x - ray centre while spectral fitting used the xspec package ( @xcite ) .",
    "the events file was reprocessed to apply the most appropriate gain file to this observation , which was made with a focal plane temperature of -120c , and to remove periods of bad background flaring .",
    "this resulted in a total of 7165s of good on - source exposure from the nominal 7260s observation .",
    "the pi column of the resulting events file was corrected for the temporal dependence of the gain by using the corr_tgain package made available by alexey vikhlinin .",
    "analysis of the cluster emission used data processed for best background discrimination from the ` very faint ' data mode .",
    "analysis of the point - source used standard ` faint mode ' processing since the point - source counts are moderately affected by pileup .    throughout this paper , we adopt a redshift for abell  3581 of @xmath4 @xcite and a cosmology that assumes a flat universe with @xmath5 and @xmath6=0.3 .",
    "we use n wright s web page to calculate that the angular diameter distance to this source is 90.9 mpc and its luminosity distance is 94.9 mpc .",
    "the linear scale is 441pc per arcsec . wherever we quote uncertainties these are at the @xmath7 level , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "in general we have used the chi - square statistic to assess goodness of fit and tests for significance of additional parmeters , but have used the xspec implementation of cash s c - statistic to determine parameter uncertainties and confidence regions .",
    "recently @xcite have carried out a detailed investigation of the fluctuations in the galactic foreground absorption equivalent hydrogen column density in the direction of this cluster .",
    "they reference two absolute measurements from the literature : @xcite , using a 2-degree beamsize find @xmath8 , while @xcite using a 35 arcmin beam found @xmath9 . in their investigation of _ fluctuations",
    "_ in the value of @xmath10 towards this cluster , using new data from the australia telescope compact array , @xcite find that at the 5@xmath11 level fluctations larger than @xmath12 are ruled out . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt therefore the value of @xmath13 ( from the more compact beam observation ) as the value of the galactic foreground absorption .    in fig .",
    "[ xray ] we show the _ chandra _ x - ray image of the central @xmath143.5x3.5 arcmin region of abell  3581 in the 0.3 - 3.0  kev band .",
    "the x - ray events were binned to have 1 arcsec pixels before being adaptively smoothed .",
    "a clear detection of an x - ray emitting active nucleus is seen close to the centre of the cluster x - ray emission .",
    "the presence of the radio source pks  1404 - 267 at the centre of this cluster has been known since the 1960s , but the _ chandra _ image shows , for the first time , that there is an x - ray emitting point source associated with it . in fig .",
    "[ xray - radio ] we show a close - up of the x - ray image ( which has been unsharp masked ) with a map of the radio source obtained from the national radio astronomy observatory archive overlaid in contours .",
    "this 700s 20 cm ( 1477  mhz ) radio image was taken on 1987 september 21 with the vla in the `` a '' configuration .",
    "the peak flux density is 396 mjy / beam with a synthesised beam of 3.34@xmath151.14 arcsec in position angle @xmath1627 degrees .",
    "clear cavities in the x - ray emission are seen to the east and west of the nucleus , coincident with the lobes of the radio source .",
    "the x - ray point source is located approximately at ra(2000)=14:07:29.8 , dec(2000)=@xmath17:01:04 .",
    "we extracted a spectrum from a circular region of radius 1.8 arcsec centred on the point source .",
    "the major component of the background for this source is the surrounding cluster emission , so in this case , we extracted the background spectrum from an annular region surrounding the nucleus with radius between 1.97 and 3.94 arcsec .",
    "spectra were rebinned to have a minimum of 20 counts per bin .",
    "redistribution matrices and ancilliary response functions were computed using calibration files from the _ chandra _ calibration database version 2.26 .",
    "this release corrects a previous one - channel offset error in the fits embedded function file and incorporates a correction for the degradation in low - energy quantum efficiency due to the build - up of a contaminant on the filter wheel .",
    "we have modelled the spectrum of the point source as a power - law modified , initially , only by galactic absorption .",
    "preliminary fit results were input to the webpimms count rate simulator which suggested that pileup was important at approximately the 8 per cent level .",
    "this is at a level where pileup is starting to become significant , so all subsequent fitting of the point source was done including the xspec implementation of the pileup model of @xcite .",
    "the best fit using the pileup model applied to a power - law with the galactic absorption column density fixed at @xmath18 gives a chi - square value of 11.2 for 20 degrees of freedom .",
    "allowing the absorption to be freely fitted does not significantly decrease the chi - square value .    in order to estimate the power - law index and its statistical uncertainties we use cash s c - statistic ( @xcite , implemented in the xspec ` cstat ` command ) since there are many pi bins with the minimum number ( 20 ) of counts .",
    "the best fitting power - law model has a photon number index of @xmath19 , a 2 - 10  kev flux of @xmath20 and a 2 - 10  kev ( rest frame ) luminosity corrected for galactic absorption of @xmath21 .",
    "the 0.1 - 10  kev luminosity is @xmath22 .",
    "we can calculate the expected luminosity of the point source , assuming that it is a black hole accreting according to standard bondi theory ( @xcite ) with a radiative efficiency of 10 per cent .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the mass of the black hole in solar masses , @xmath25 is the electron density in @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the accreting gas temperature in kev .",
    "the work of @xcite gives the mass of the black hole in pks  1404 - 267 as being in the range @xmath28 while the temperature and density of our innermost spatial bin calculated from the ` projct ` model in section 4.2 are @xmath29  kev and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "these values yield a bolometric luminosity of @xmath31 .",
    "if we assume that most of the accretion luminosity comes out in the 0.1 - 10 kev band then the ratio of observed to expected luminosity is 0.016 .",
    "the nucleus is underluminous by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "this is much larger than any expected bolometric correction ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we note also that part of the ` point ' source may actually be the innermost parts of the radio jets , at the nucleus itself .",
    "we note that appropriate values of temperature and density to put into the formula for the luminosity are those pertaining at the accretion radius : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sound speed , or @xmath36 for the innermost measured value of @xmath27 in our data @xmath37  kpc , which is much closer to the nucleus than our innermost bin can resolve ( 5  kpc ) .",
    "the work of @xcite on m87 has shown that going in from 5  kpc to the central 1  kpc region the intracluster medium temperature drops by about a factor of two while the density rises by about a factor of three .",
    "if similar trends occur in pks  1404 - 267 they would increase the expected accretion luminosity , and the discrepancy in the observed value , by more than a factor of 8 .",
    "we note that underluminous accretion is also seen in m87 ( in the virgo cluster ) by @xcite , ngc  6166 ( in abell  2199 ) by @xcite , and the sombrero galaxy by @xcite .",
    "however , in these objects the luminosity deficit is rather larger ( a factor of @xmath38 ) despite the black hole mass being very similar to the one considered here .",
    "possible solutions to the discrepancy are discussed by @xcite .",
    "since the surface brightness distribution of the cluster emission is quite circularly symmetric we have extracted spectra from a series of concentric circular annuli centred on the nuclear point source , but excluding counts from that point source , and one other at : ra(2000)=14:07:32.6 , dec(2000)=@xmath17:00:41 . fig .",
    "[ regions ] shows the regions used overlaid on an image of the cluster .",
    "the radio source is contained almost entirely within the central 5  kpc radius region .",
    "it is not possible to use on - chip data from the same observation as background since the cluster occupies the whole of the s3 chip .",
    "we therefore reprocessed the standard background field which most nearly matched the observation date and instrumental configuration to have the same gain file as the target observation .",
    "it was not possible to apply the time - dependent gain correction to the background events since the time of observation has been removed from the standard background fields .",
    "background spectra were extracted from identical chip regions of the reprocessed background file by reprojecting the detector coordinates on to the sky coordinates of the target observation .",
    "redistribution matrices and ancilliary response files for these spatially extended regions were made using the ciao 3.0.2 tools mkrmf and mkwarf .",
    "background spectra were extracted from the same regions of the standard background fields as were used to extract the source spectra .",
    "single temperature ` mekal ` ( @xcite ) plasma emission models , incorporating freely fitting galactic absorption were fitted ( separately ) to the spectra extracted from each annulus .",
    "the absorption , temperature , metallicity and normalizations are free parameters for each annulus . in fig .",
    "[ projprof ] we show the absorption , temperature and metallicity profiles of the cluster gas derived from these fits .",
    "the absorption measured in the annuli beyond 40  kpc from the nucleus does seem to be slightly systematically low compared with the galactic column density inferred from 21 cm observations which is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ projprof ] .",
    "this may indicate the level of uncertainty in the model for the correction of the contaminant that has caused the degradation of the low - energy response in the _ chandra _ data .",
    "we also note that the absorption column density increases roughly linearly from 75  kpc in towards the centre of the cluster by @xmath39 .",
    "@xcite found that the central 3  arcmin region from the asca data required a column density of @xmath40 .",
    "such a large value would be consistent with inner 40  kpc or 90  arcsec of the _ chandra _ data .",
    "however , if the instrumental absorption has been overcorrected in the current analysis then a greater degree of agreement between the asca and _ chandra _ data is to be expected .",
    "the work of @xcite has shown that the galactic foreground 21 cm emission is constant to within @xmath41 ( @xmath42 upper limit on the fluctuation ) in this region of the sky so it is unlikely that variations in galactic absorption can offer a viable explanation for the increased absorption .",
    "the excess absorption seems to be centred on the cluster which would argue for a cluster origin rather than a galactic origin .",
    "the nucleus does not however appear to require any excess absorption ( see section 3 ) .",
    "looking now at the temperature profile , it is clear that the central region of the cluster is cool , at @xmath43  kev and that the temperature rises by nearly a factor of @xmath44 to reach a maximum at 75  kpc from the nucleus . in the one region exterior to this",
    "the cluster temperature drops again to near 1.9  kev , although not with high significance .",
    "we note that due to the fact that the cluster is not centred on the s3 chip the outermost region is only a partial annulus .",
    "the metallicity in the innermost region has a low value of @xmath45 times the solar value ( assuming the solar values of @xcite ) . in the region between 5 and 90 kpc from the nucleus we find a much higher value of @xmath46 times the solar value .",
    "further out the metallicity falls quickly to @xmath47 times the solar value again .    in order to assess whether the fall in temperature beyond 90  kpc is cluster wide",
    ", we have used an accumulative smoothing / contour binning technique due to j. sanders ( to be described by sanders et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) to define spatial bins of given signal - to - noise ratio for spectral fitting .",
    "this allowed us to drop the assumption of circular symmetry .",
    "briefly , a surface brightness map was produced from the raw counts using a smoothing algorithm which accumulated counts around each pixel until a signal - to - noise ratio of 15 was reached (  accumulative smoothing \" ) .",
    "the binning method (  contour binning \" ) then grew bins along directions where the surface brightness is closest to the existing value , until the signal - to - noise ratio exceeded 30 .",
    "finally , bins were constrained to have an edge length less than or equal to three times the circumference of a circle of the same area as the bin .",
    "signal - to - noise ratios are calculated taking into account noise in the background spectrum which is extracted from identical regions in chip coordinates from the standard background files .",
    "spectra were extracted from these regions and binned to 20 counts per spectral bin .",
    "new response matrices and ancilliary response functions were made corresponding to these regions which were then fit independently using cash s c - statistic .",
    "the resulting temperature map is shown in fig .",
    "[ tmap ] .",
    "it is clear now that the south western part of the cluster is systematically hotter than the northern part . since the outermost annulus comes only from the northern part of the cluster it is not surprising that the outermost annulus has a temperature below the one immediately interior to it since that partial annulus covers the hotter region .    in fig .",
    "[ tmapradio ] we show a close - up of the temperature map of the central region of the cluster with the radio intensity contours overplotted .",
    "there is some suggestion that the radio source avoids the the coolest gas , which may be a direct indication that the radio source heats the gas .",
    "the precise locations of the boundaries of the individual regions selected for fitting are however somewhat sensitive to the smoothing and signal - to - noise parameters of the contour accretion technique , and are required to follow the surface brightness of the cluster emission .",
    "we have fit the annular spectra accounting for projection of counts from the exterior regions into interior annuli using the ` projct ` model in xspec , and assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "the volumes of the shells sampled by each annulus are calculated from fits header items which describe the inner and outer boundaries of the annuli .",
    "we note that the cluster emission extends beyond the outermost annulus of our analysis so that the emitting volume associated with the outermost annulus is too small .",
    "this causes too much projection on to the next annulus in , so that the fit to that annulus underestimates its brightness .",
    "the resulting effect is minimal beyond the outer two annuli because the amount of projection is relatively small due to the steep surface brightness profile ; see section 4.3 .",
    "the model which we have fitted consists of a single temperature ` mekal ` plasma emission model in which the temperature and metallicity at each radius are freely fit . a single value of the foreground absorption column density is also allowed to fit freely and obtains a value of @xmath48 , consistent with that expected from the hi 21 cm measurements .    in fig .",
    "[ deprojprof ] we show the temperature and metallicity profiles of the cluster gas derived from these fits accounting for projection .",
    "the temperature climbs steadily from 0.8  kev within the central 5  kpc to around 2.25  kev between 60 - 90  kpc .",
    "we note that the intrinsic temperature of the central bin is substantially cooler when taking into account the hotter gas seen in projection against it . in the outermost",
    "annulus the temperature drops back to 1.5  kev . since this region is only a part of an annulus , to the north of the cluster ( fig  [ regions ] ) , it is not clear whether this decline in temperature is due to substructure or in fact a coherent property of the cluster .",
    "the metallicity is consistent with 0.8 solar thoughout most of the cluster observed in our dataset .",
    "the very innermost region ( within 5  kpc , but excluding the nuclear point source ) and the region beyond 90  kpc both have much lower values of metal abundance , at around 0.1 times the solar value .",
    "the drop in metallicity in the central bin could be due either to an extended power - law component , or to the iron - bias effect @xcite .",
    "the iron - bias effect results from fitting a plasma containing more than one distinct temperature component with a single temperature model .",
    "we have tested for the possibility of there being a spatially extended power - law or a second ` mekal ` component by adding them ( separately ) to the baseline ` projct * phabs ( mekal ) ` model ( model 1 ) , but only in the central bin . the results of these fits are compared with the baseline model in table [ table1 ] . for the test with the power - law component ( model 2 ) , both index and normalization were left as free parameters while for the test with a second ` mekal ` component ( model 2 ) we allowed a freely fitting temperature and normalization but tied the metallicity to that of the first ` mekal ` component . for both tests we found that the metallicity was very poorly constrained and preferred to fit to unphysically large values ; we have therefore imposed an upper limit of twice the solar value on this parameter .",
    "indeed the best fit value of the metallicity hits this limit , but we note that allowing much higher values of metallicity does not reduce the value of the chi - square statistic significantly . our lower limits on the metallicity presented in [ table1 ] correspond to an increase of 1.0 in the c - statistic from the value fitted with the metallicity at twice the solar value .    for the model including the power - law component",
    "an f - test suggests that there is a 6 per cent chance of obtaining such a significant drop in chi - square if the power - law component is _ not _ present . for the model including the second ` mekal ` component an f - test indicates that there is only a 0.7 per cent chance of obtaining such a significant drop in chi - square if the second ` mekal ` component is _ not _ present .    .",
    "parameters , for the central spatial bin , of models fitted taking into account projection effects .",
    "model 1 is ` projct * phabs ( mekal ) ` .",
    "model 2 is ` projct * phabs ( mekal + po ) ` .",
    "model 3 is ` projct * phabs ( mekal + mekal ) ` . in models 2 and 3",
    "the power - law and second ` mekal ` components are only present in the innermost spatial bin .",
    "temperatures are given in kev , abundances are relative to the solar value and column densities are in units of @xmath49 . ``",
    "d of f '' is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]    adding in a second ` mekal ` component ( model 2 ) in which the metallicity is linked to the first component reduces the chi - square value to 303.9 for 203 degrees of freedom and gives a significantly better fit ( f - test significance=@xmath50 ) .",
    "next we have substituted a cooling flow model for the second ` mekal ` component ( model 3 ) in which the upper temperature and metallicity of the cooling flow are tied to that of the ` mekal ` component , and the lowest temperature in the cooling flow model is below the _ chandra _ band .",
    "although this model is not a better fit than the two - temperature model in terms of the chi - square statistic , it only introduces one further fit parameter instead of two for model 2 and an f - test shows the rediction in chi - square for this model to have a greater level of significance ( @xmath51 ) .",

    "( note that for comparison with previous values of mass deposition rate published by @xcite this value should be doubled to account for the different assumed value of @xmath53 . )    finally , allowing the lower temperature of the cooling flow to be a free parameter allows chi - square to drop further to 302.8 .",
    "there is an f - test probability of 0.15 of obtaining such a large drop in chi - square if the additional fit parameter were not required .",

    "@xcite performed a surface brightness deprojection of the _ rosat _ hri data . within the central 3  arcmin ( 110  kpc in @xmath56 ,",
    "@xmath57 used in that paper ) , a mass deposition rate of @xmath58 was found . scaling these values to our current cosmology would give a value of @xmath59 , around a factor of three higher than fitted in this section when the gas is allowed to cool to very low temperatures .",
    "similar results have been found for many other clusters by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite",
    ". a lower cutoff temperature to the cooling gas proposed . at a cutoff temperature of around @xmath60  kev agreement with the deprojection mass deposition rates is achieved , albeit with a poor chi - square value .",
    "we note that 0.8  kev is the lowest temperature directly observed in the ` projct ` fits of section 4.2 .",
    "the problem remains as to why the gas appears to cool by about a factor of @xmath61 yet not any further and does not accumulate at the lower temperature .",
    "so far we have considered heating in abell  3581 only from the point of view of balancing the cooling from the icm in the core of the cluster .",
    "however , there is a more global property of clusters that shows that heating has been important .",
    "the observed luminosity / temperature ( @xmath62 ) relation for clusters , where @xmath63 ( e.g. @xcite ) rather than @xmath64 as expected if only gravitational heating is involved ( @xcite ) , indicates that some form of extra heating has taken place .",
    "the level corresponds to about 2 - 3  kev per particle ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "low temperature clusters and groups show a large dispersion in the @xmath65 relation ( @xcite ) , which may mean that although heating is widespread , it is not the same in all objects .",
    "one possible origin for the heating , which has been suggested by many authors , is the radio source which is often associated with the central galaxy .",
    "we have measured the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity in the central 60  kpc of both the perseus cluster and abell  3581 ( excluding the point sources ) and find values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively in the 0.3 - 10  kev band , so the perseus cluster is factor of ten brighter than pks  1404 - 267 in this region . by comparison , the 1.4  ghz radio luminosity of the inner two radio lobes in the perseus cluster is @xmath68 while the 1.4  ghz radio luminosity of the lobes in pks  1404 - 267 is @xmath69 , showing that the distributed radio power in the perseus cluster is also a factor of ten brighter than in pks  1404 - 267 .",
    "abell  3581 is therefore particularly interesting as it is a low temperature cluster with a strong radio source where heating seems not to have been effective , even close to the active nucleus .",
    "@xcite have suggested that heating by the agn should also affect the entropy profile of a cluster beyond the coolest parts . even if the radio source has offset radiative cooling in the very innermost regions ,",
    "it is clear that it has not had a strong influence on the gas entropy at @xmath70 , compared with similar low temperature clusters .",
    "various explanations for this are possible .",
    "a ) the radio source may be very young compared with the radiative cooling time of hundreds of myrs , in which case radiative cooling would have dominated in the past .",
    "however , no rapidly cooling cluster has yet been found elsewhere .",
    "b ) the major heating phase in clusters may have occurred 5 or more billion years ago , beyond @xmath71 , when the central active galaxy or galaxies were much more important .",
    "this may have been a variable process which has left some clusters without significant heating .",
    "c ) perhaps abell  3581 is particularly old and thus dense , and has had few recent mergers .",
    "cooling in its high density core may absorb all the kinetic energy produced by the present active nucleus so that little is available for the rest of the gas .",
    "d ) the dense core may have been introduced into the cluster as a result of a merger , or e ) the dense cool core may have caused the moderately powerful radio source by more effectively fuelling the central black hole .",
    "radio source heating as inferred for the perseus cluster ( by the dissipation of sound waves ; @xcite ) may also apply , and scale , to abell  3581 .",
    "the core of abell  3581 appears to be similar to that of the perseus cluster , except that it is about an order of magnitude less luminous and has a temperature that is about one third of that in the perseus cluster .",
    "somehow the core has avoided the heating , or at least the effects of heating , common to most other low temperature clusters and groups .",
