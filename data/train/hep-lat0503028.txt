    "the state @xmath8 denotes the vacuum .",
    "the reason why it is customary to compute such ratio of path integrals is due to the monte carlo method with importance sampling ( like metropolis ) which works only for such ratio .",

    "now the measure @xmath3 $ ] is no longer given by the haar measure only , but there is a factor @xmath14 involved for a lattice of @xmath15 intermediate time slices .",
    "it is the objective of this article to construct such measure .",
    "physical scenarios which require the calculation of single amplitudes are : amplitudes of decay reactions , the partition function @xmath16 , the free energy @xmath17 given in terms of the partition function , or matrix elements involved in the construction of the monte carlo hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "consider a lagrangian of the form @xmath18 the transition amplitude in imaginary time , expressed as a path integral over @xmath15 intermediate time slices is given by @xmath19 | x_{in } \\rangle = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } dx_{1 } \\cdots dx_{n-1 }   \\left ( \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2 \\pi \\hbar a_{0 } } } \\right)^{n } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{1}{\\hbar } \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1 }   a_{0}[\\frac{m}{2}(\\frac{x_{j+1 } - x_{j}}{a_{0}})^{2 }   - v(x_{j } ) ]   \\right ] , x_{in } = x_{0 } , ~ x_{fi } = x_{n } , ~ a_{0 } = t / n ~ .",

    "let us consider @xmath32 on the lattice without fermions .",
    "the group of gauge symmetry is @xmath0 .",
    "we keep in mind how to construct a lattice hamiltonian ( see e.g , creutz@xcite , rothe@xcite ) via the transfer matrix , by splitting the lattice action into terms of time - like and space - like plaquettes , @xmath33 & = & \\frac{1}{g^{2}}\\frac{a}{a_{0 } } \\sum_{\\box_{time - like } }   [ 1 -re(u_{\\box } ) ] +   \\frac{1}{g^{2}}\\frac{a_{0}}{a } \\sum_{\\box_{space - like } }   [ 1 -re(u_{\\box } ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv &   s^{kin}[u ] + s^{pot}[u ] ~ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] like in quantum mechanics , the extra factor in the measure is determined solely by the kinetic term .",
