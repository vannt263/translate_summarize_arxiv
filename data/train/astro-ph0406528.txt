    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as a result , young neutron stars in their various guises are rare , as are young pulsars . nevertheless , the payoff resulting from their study can be large , in areas as varied as the physics of core collapse , the internal structure of neutron stars , and magnetospheric emission processes .",
    "also , the youngest neutron stars are often embedded in compact nebulae powered by relativistic pulsar winds or otherwise interact with their host supernova remnants  as such they can make for magnificent probes of their immediate environment .",
    "young pulsars are also particularly useful for establishing reliable birth rates of this important branch of outcomes of core - collapse sne . for these reasons , substantial effort continues to be devoted to the detection of the youngest neutron stars , and three - quarters of the galactic pulsars known with an age @xmath7kyr have been discovered in the past seven years at radio and x - ray wavelengths .    in this letter",
    "we announce the discovery of , a very young , relatively energetic and nearby pulsar , present its rotational history during a span of 4.5 years that includes a large glitch , and comment on the immediate environment of the pulsar and in particular on a nearby supernova remnant candidate .",
    ", with a period @xmath8ms , was discovered on 1999 october 7 in data collected during the course of the parkes multibeam survey of the galactic plane ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this survey employs a 13-beam low - noise receiver system at a central radio frequency of 1374mhz with a recorded bandwidth of 288mhz .",
    "the large area covered by one pointing enables the 35min - long individual integrations that , together with the high instantaneous sensitivity , result in the good limiting flux density of about 0.2mjy for long period pulsars over a large area along the galactic plane ( @xmath9 ) . in turn",
    "this has led to the discovery of more than 700 pulsars @xcite .",
    "after discovery , as with every newly detected pulsar , we began regular timing observations of  at parkes , using the filterbank - based observing system employed in the survey .",
    "typically this consists of the recording to magnetic tape of raw data for about 15min in order to obtain off - line a pulse profile from which we derive the time - of - arrival ( toa ) of a fiducial point on the profile by cross - correlation with a high signal - to - noise ratio template .",
    "the average pulse shape consists of a single approximately symmetric peak with fwhm = 15ms ( @xmath10 ) . in this manner",
    "we obtained 125 toas spanning the mjd range 5145853104 , a period of 4.5yr .    using the initial set of toas together with the tempo timing software we obtained a phase - connected solution for the pulsar accounting for every turn of the neutron star . in short order",
    "it became apparent that this pulsar has a large period derivative and therefore a very small characteristic age , @xmath11yr .",
    "some 18 months after we began timing the pulsar , on about mjd 52000 , it underwent a very large rotational glitch , with a fractional period spin - up of two parts in one million ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : glitch ] for the evolution of spin parameters over time ) . in magnitude",
    ", this is typical of the glitches that the @xmath12kyr - old vela pulsar experiences every few years but , interestingly , there is no evidence for an exponentially decaying component as is observed in the vela glitches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is not possible to track the rotation phase of the neutron star across this large glitch .",
    "we find that fitting a timing model to the full three - year data set since the glitch shows a large quasi - periodicity in the residuals with a @xmath13 day period , probably due to `` timing noise '' .",
    "this can be largely absorbed with a fit requiring a total of six frequency derivatives to whiten the data . for simplicity and to aid observers , the solution we present in table  [ tab : parms ] is based on the most recent one year s worth of data , requiring only two derivatives , with the second frequency - derivative representing the amount of timing noise .",
    "we also provide the net jump in spin parameters at the glitch epoch .",
    "we emphasize that the value of @xmath14 is _ not _ deterministic ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : glitch ] ) .",
    "it yields an apparent braking index of rotation @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 ) , which is about 15 times larger than the expected long - term deterministic value .",
    "the presence of significant amounts of timing noise in  is a presumed consequence of the less - than - perfect rotational stability of the young , hot neutron star with a complex superfluid interior ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such noise biases the pulsar position obtained through timing methods",
    ". however , we did not have to rely on timing measurements to obtain the position , since we performed a pulse - gated interferometric observation with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) on 2000 august 29 .",
    "this 5-hour observation used the array in its 6a configuration , giving a maximum baseline of 6 km , with a central frequency of 1376mhz and a bandwidth of 128mhz .",
    "the interferometric pulsar position , determined from an image made by subtraction of an off - pulse data set from an on - pulse data set , is given in table  [ tab : parms ] , and was used for all timing fits .",
    "the actual age of , assuming a constant magnetic moment , is @xmath18/(n-1)$ ] , where @xmath19 is the initial rotation frequency of the neutron star .",
    "we do not know the actual braking index of the pulsar .",
    "however , if it lies in the range @xmath20 , as is the case for all four pulsars with @xmath16 measured via phase - coherent timing ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , then the real age is still @xmath21kyr and may be @xmath22kyr , depending on the actual values of @xmath16 and @xmath19 .",
    "also , while such youth is not required by the occurrence of the large glitch ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is certainly consistent with it .",
    "there is therefore no doubt that is a very young pulsar , one of the @xmath23 youngest known in the galaxy ( see table  [ tab : young ] ) .",
    "is also apparently nearby : according to the @xcite model for the galactic free electron distribution and our dispersion measure , the distance is @xmath24kpc .",
    "the @xcite model yields @xmath25kpc , suggesting the order of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates .",
    "the implied distance of the pulsar away from the galactic plane is 100200pc . in any case",
    ", this pulsar appears to be one of the two or three nearest to the earth among those known with @xmath26kyr . considering , furthermore",
    ", that all known pulsars apparently younger than  are associated with a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) or a supernova remnant ( snr ) , it seems reasonable to expect that this might also be the case with .",
    "figure  [ fig : pks_image ] shows the area around  as seen in the 2.4ghz continuum survey of @xcite , with two snr candidates proposed by @xcite indicated .",
    "it is not clear what , if any , is the relationship between both snr candidates , or of either one with a much larger superimposed shell snr candidate , g310.53.5 .",
    "also , no spectral , distance or age information is available for these candidates .",
    "the snr candidate appears at this resolution to be about @xmath27 in length with a relatively bright resolved `` core '' to the southwest . in turn , is located , at least in projection , slightly to the east of this core , but coincident with emission from the snr candidate .",
    "apart from , there are seven other known pulsars located in the area of the figure , all old , with @xmath28myr .",
    ", with @xmath29yr , is among the youngest pulsars known in the galaxy .",
    "it is also the second youngest pulsar discovered in the parkes multibeam survey , after psr  j11196127 with @xmath30yr @xcite .",
    "the pulsar is located near the snr candidate .",
    "while all apparently younger pulsars are associated either with a pwn or snr , three slightly older pulsars are not obviously associated with either such object ( table  [ tab : young ] ) .",
    "further work is therefore needed in order to investigate the nature of , and also to determine whether it is in fact associated with the pulsar .",
    "being a young and energetic pulsar located at apparently only @xmath31kpc , one would expect substantial x - ray emission to be detectable from .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : young ] , this is the case for all younger pulsars ( interestingly , only the crab pulsar among these is a known optical emitter , and only the crab and psr  b150958 are known @xmath32-ray emitters ) .",
    "a check of the heasarc archives reveals no useful data to address this question , and x - ray observations of this source will have to be carried out .",
    "also , there is no known egret @xmath32-ray source coincident with this relatively energetic and nearby pulsar @xcite , but  is likely to be a good target for the future _ glast _ mission .    the large value of @xmath33 ( and hence apparent @xmath16 ) implied by the increasing @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : glitch ] ) possibly results from decay after previous ( unseen ) glitches @xcite .",
    "however , it is notable that there is no discernible jump in @xmath33 at the time of the observed glitch . in most cases , following a large glitch",
    ", a portion of the jump in @xmath35 and @xmath34 decays with a time scale that ranges from a few days ( for the crab pulsar ) to many months ( in the vela pulsar ) .",
    "this results in a jump in @xmath33 at the time of the glitch .",
    "the absence of this for the present glitch suggests either that the decay time - scale is much longer than our data span , or that different glitches in this pulsar have different characteristics .",
    "the radio luminosity of  is @xmath36mjykpc@xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the flux density in the 1400mhz band .",
    "this is a rather low value : for the 10 radio pulsars in table  [ tab : young ] , the median @xmath39mjykpc@xmath37 .",
    "however , it is in keeping with the realization that the very youngest pulsars ( @xmath40kyr ) are not obviously more luminous than slightly older pulsars ( the median luminosity for pulsars with @xmath41yr is @xmath42mjykpc@xmath37 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or than middle - aged pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as we now show , the discovery of a low - luminosity pulsar such as contributes greatly toward the estimated birth rate of very young pulsars . to do this ,",
    "we make use of the pulsars listed in table  [ tab : young ] that were detected in the parkes multibeam survey : b150958 , j11196127 , j13576429 , b161050 and j17343333 .",
    "for each pulsar we carried out a monte carlo simulation to correct for the volume of the galaxy probed by the multibeam survey , using the @xmath43-style technique to estimate the total number of similar objects beaming toward earth ( for details see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . using the most recent estimates of the galactic pulsar distribution in these simulations @xcite",
    ", we find that the total number of such pulsars with @xmath44kyr is @xmath45 . taking into account the correction due to the unknown `` beaming fraction '' @xmath46 ,",
    "the implied birth rate of this population is @xmath47century@xmath2 ( where @xmath48 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while having a large uncertainty ( reflecting the inclusion of , which accounts for 90% of the @xmath43 correction so that it dominates the calculation ; more generally , we may not know enough about the low end of the radio luminosity distribution ) , this birth rate is comparable to those obtained using much larger ( and on average much older ) samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the poorly known pulsar birth rate and beaming fraction , it appears unlikely that more than @xmath49 galactic pulsars with @xmath44kyr are beaming toward us , since the estimated core - collapse sn rate in our galaxy ( while also having significant uncertainties ) must account also for other branches of neutron star production ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for discussions of birth rates of other types of neutron stars ) . in this case",
    ", the 11 pulsars listed in table  [ tab : young ] located on the `` near side '' of the galaxy ( all but psr  j18460258 ) could represent about one quarter of all such young pulsars from which we may ever detect pulsations .",
    "alternatively , the discovery of many more would have significant implications for some of the assumptions underlying these estimates .",
    "nine of the 12 pulsars listed in table  [ tab : young ] have been discovered in the past seven years , in both directed and undirected searches , and at radio wavelengths as well as in x - rays , methods that suffer from significantly different selection effects . in view of the above discussion",
    ", it is important to continue with such searches , employing diverse methods .",
    "young pulsars are rare , and young nearby ones are rarer still .",
    "if is indeed located at @xmath50kpc , with a visual extinction @xmath51 , and with a probable real age of 515kyr , it is well possible that its birth event provided a spectacular sight to some of our recent pre - historical ancestors . of greater relevance for us ,",
    "if not quite as spectacularly , future study of this very young and nearby pulsar and any possible pwn / snr companion may contribute one more significant piece toward understanding young neutron stars and their environments .",
