    "x  1822@xmath0371  is a low mass x - ray binary and is the prototypical ` accretion disc corona ' ( adc ) source @xcite . the 5.57hr orbital period of x  1822@xmath0371  @xcite exhibits a quasi - sinusoidal variation in both the x - ray and optical ( see also mason & crdova 1982 ; hellier & mason 1989 ) .",
    "in addition , there is an approximately 20min long dip associated with partial obscuration of the x - ray source by the secondary mass - donating star ( presumed to be filling its roche lobe ; see white et al .",
    "1981 , white & holt 1982 , mason & crdova 1982 , hellier & mason 1989 , and hellier et al . 1992 ) .",
    "thus x  1822@xmath0371  is believed to be a near edge on source ; however , since the x - ray dip henceforth defined to be at zero orbital phase is only partial , the x - rays are presumed to emanate from a very extended corona with a radius of the order of @xmath5 cm .    assuming a distance of 2kpc @xcite , the observed x - ray flux corresponds to an isotropic luminosity of @xmath6 .",
    "the central x - ray source is obscured , however , and we only observe x - rays scattered into our line of sight .",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity is therefore undoubtedly greater , perhaps substantially so ( see  [ sec : discuss ] ) .",
    "the properties and origin of this scattering corona are largely unknown .",
    "white & holt postulated a corona , possibly optically thick , driven by a photoionizing radiation flux near the eddington luminosity . in their model , a near eddington luminosity is required to achieve the large scale height of the corona .",
    "frank et al . postulated that the corona was due to interaction of the incoming accretion stream with the disc at the circularization radius .",
    "viscous dissipation at radii within the circularization radius would in part lead to the vertical extent of the corona .",
    "the sinusoidal modulation is associated with obscuration by material with a vertical extent of order @xmath7 cm @xcite .",
    "frank et al . postulated that this obscuring material is also located at the disc circularization radius .",
    "however , the fact that the optical lightcurve also shows a sinusoidal modulation and a dip with approximately twice the duration of that in the x - ray suggests that this obscuring rim is actually at twice this radius , i.e. , closer to the disc tidal truncation radius ( hellier & mason 1989 ; see also  [ sec : lcfit ] below ) .",
    "again , this rim is associated with the interaction of the accretion stream with the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most confusing aspect of x  1822@xmath0371  has been its spectra .",
    "white et al .",
    "fit _ einstein _",
    "spectra with a flat , exponentially cutoff power law ( photon index , @xmath8 , cutoff energy @xmath9kev ) .",
    "furthermore , they required a broad ( 4kev wide ) fe line component with equivalent width @xmath10kev and a soft excess that they attributed to either a 0.25kev blackbody or possibly an fe l complex .",
    "hellier & mason , on the other hand , fit _ exosat _",
    "spectra with a flat power law ( @xmath11 ) , an @xmath12kev blackbody , and an fe k@xmath13 line with 270 ev equivalent width .",
    "the flux of the blackbody had an implied emitting area consistent with 1/400 of the surface area of a neutron star .",
    "hellier & mason therefore postulated that this emission is indeed from a neutron star surface and is scattered into our line of sight by a very optically thin corona .",
    "several years later , hellier et al . considered _",
    "spectra of x  1822@xmath0371 , and they attempted to fit the same model as for the _ exosat _  data .",
    "although such a model was the best simple fit that they could achieve , the fits were not adequate and yielded a reduced @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , hellier et al . noted that the dip at zero orbital phase was fractionally larger at higher energies .",
    "they interpreted this fact as indicating that the corona was in fact optically thick .",
    "hellier et al .",
    "claim that over the orbital timescales , the fe k@xmath15 band shows greater variability than the continuum bands . more recently ,",
    "parmar et al .",
    "( hereafter p00 ) examined _ bepposax _  and _ advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics _ ( _ asca _ ) data of x  1822@xmath0371 .",
    "( we consider some of the same _ asca _  data in  [ sec : data ] below . )",
    "they consider a model comprised of comptonization of a wien tail ( @xmath16ev ) in a very optically thick , low temperature corona ( @xmath17 , @xmath18kev ) .",
    "also required in these fits are a blackbody with @xmath19kev and an fe k@xmath13 line with equivalent width 65150ev .",
    "this latter feature possibly could be in reality two lines ( fe k@xmath15 ) , not adequately resolved from one another .",
    "p00 found no evidence for either an fe k - edge or o k - edge ; however , they claim a detection of a 1.31.4kev edge with @xmath20@xmath21 that they associate with k - edges of ne x and neutral mg , or the l - edges of moderately ionized fe .",
    "( see our discussion of  [ sec : discuss ] , however . )",
    "the question of whether x  1822@xmath0371  contains a neutron star , black hole , or even a white dwarf primary also is yet unresolved .",
    "the lightcurves have been fitted with a model with a @xmath1 primary @xcite ; however , as we discuss in  [ sec : lcfit ] these fits do not uniquely determine the primary mass . to date , no variability has been detected that would uniquely point to a neutron star primary ( see hellier et al .",
    "1990 for variability analysis of the _ ginga _  data ) .",
    "previous analyses only detected variability on the orbital time scales .    facing a new generation of x - ray satellites",
    ", we decided to revisit x  1822@xmath0371   with the help of predominantly unpublished simultaneous archival _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) and _ asca _  data .",
    "our goal is to assess the evidence gathered so far and to point out what we believe to be future avenues for cutting edge x - ray spectroscopy , as will be provided by the _ x - ray multiple mirror - newton _ telescope ( _ xmm - newton _ ) and _ chandra_. first , we discuss the orbital ephemeris (  [ sec : orbit ] ) and the gross spectral variations over the orbit (  [ sec : spectra ] ) .",
    "we then consider two separate spectral models which can be considered as broadly representing an ` optically thick corona ' and an ` optically thin corona ' (  [ sec : spectra ] ) . using the _ rxte _  lightcurves , we consider fits in multiple energy bands (  [ sec : lcfit ] ) . here",
    "we consider both optically thick and optically thin coronae , and furthermore we consider white dwarf , neutron star , and low mass black hole primaries .",
    "the high frequency ( @xmath22@xmath21hz ) variability of the _ rxte _  data is then considered (  [ sec : var ] ) .",
    "we then discuss the implications of these analyses (  [ sec : discuss ] ) and present our conclusions (  [ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "in this paper we analyze a set of simultaneous _ rxte _  and _ asca _   observations of x  1822@xmath0371  taken in 1996 and a separate set of _ asca _   observations from 1993 , as summarized in table [ tab : instruments ] . details of the data reduction procedure are summarized in the appendix . for _ rxte _",
    "we only consider data from the _ proportional counter array _ ( _ pca _ ) , while for _ asca _",
    "we consider data from both the _ solid state imaging spectrometers _ ( _ sis _ ) and the _ gas imaging spectrometers _ ( _ gis _ ) .    .observation log . [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we use the simultaneous _ rxte_/_asca _  data to perform `",
    "global ' , broad - band fits , and not for detailed line spectroscopy . in",
    "what follows , we therefore have combined the two separate _ sis _  spectra into one spectrum and",
    "likewise we have combined the two separate _",
    "_  spectra into a single spectrum . as we use the 1993",
    "_ asca _  spectra for detailed line modelling , we do not combine the separate _ sis _",
    "spectra for those observations .",
    "updated parameters on ephemeris and period changes have most recently been provided by p00 , including all three data sets analyzed in this paper . to confirm the measurements by p00 , we fitted the eclipse with a linear function attenuated by a gaussian .",
    "our fits agree with those of p00 to within the error bars ( indicated by parentheses below ) .",
    ". give a quadratic ephemeris for the eclipse midpoint as a function of orbital number , @xmath23 , of @xmath24 this implies a period derivative of @xmath25 ( see also hellier et al .",
    "thus @xmath26years .",
    "we can now use this value to estimate the mass transfer rate in the system .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath27 of the mass lost from the secondary is transferred to the primary , while the remaining fraction @xmath28 is lost from the system at the location of the primary ( e.g. , in the form of a central disc wind or jet ) : @xmath29 .",
    "the angular momentum loss is then @xmath30 . if we define the usual mass ratio @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the masses of the primary and the secondary respectively , we can write the mass accretion rate onto the primary as @xmath34^{-1 } ~~. \\label{eq : m1dot}\\ ] ] for @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( see  [ sec : lcfit ] ) this gives @xmath37^{-1 } { \\rm g \\ , s^{-1 } }",
    "\\cr    & = & 3.3 \\times 10^{-8 } \\left(1 - f\\right)\\left[1 + 0.14    f\\right]^{-1 } { \\rm { { \\rm m_\\odot}}\\ , yr^{-1 } } ~~. \\label{eq : mdot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the eddington accretion rate for a @xmath38 compact object is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the radiative efficiency .",
    "the second term in square brackets of eq.([eq : m1dot ] ) is small for @xmath41 .",
    "if , on the other hand , most of the mass loss occurs in the form of a wind from the secondary , the estimate for @xmath42 is much less well - constrained . since x  1822@xmath0371  is a lmxb , however , it is somewhat unlikely that the low - mass companion will have a very strong wind",
    ".    the above mass loss rate implies a change of the roche lobe radius of the secondary , @xmath43 , on comparably short time scales as the orbital period evolution .",
    "specifically , one can show that given the above assumptions @xmath44",
    "\\frac{\\dot m_2}{m_2 } ~~.   \\label{eq : rdot}\\ ] ] that is , for @xmath45 , the secondary s roche lobe radius is expanding , even for large mass loss via a wind , and therefore we expect strong mass transfer to be a short - lived phenomenon in this system .",
    "this conclusion is unaltered even if the ( non - magnetic ) wind mass loss occurs at radii as large as the disc circularization radius .",
    "if instead we postulate conservative mass transfer but an unspecified source of angular momentum loss ( perhaps from magnetic braking and gravitational radiation ) sufficiently large to lead to @xmath46 , this implies an even larger mass transfer rate than discussed above ( @xmath47 for a @xmath1 primary ) , and also implies a characteristic angular momentum loss time scale of order @xmath48 .",
    "we return to these considerations in  [ sec : discuss ] .      given the uncertainties in the physical conditions in this system we felt it appropriate to keep spectral fitting to a phenomenological level .",
    "the fits we will present in the following are meant to represent just the essential features of the two physical cases outlined in the introduction : optically thick and optically thin geometries .",
    "_ exosat _",
    "observations show an energy dependence of the modulation depth both for the sinusoidal component due to the accretion disc rim and the quasi - gaussian eclipse due to the companion @xcite .",
    "such a dependence might indicate a temperature stratification in the coronal region .",
    "we have tested the simultaneous _ rxte _  and _ asca _",
    "observations for such a trend by fitting a series of harmonics and a gaussian to the x - ray lightcurves of the three instruments ( _ pca _ , _ sis _ , and _ gis _ ) .",
    "after inspection for convergence we truncated the fitting at the third harmonic . the fits",
    "confirm the trends reported by hellier & mason .",
    "the fractional depth of the lowest order harmonic decreases with energy between 0.6 kev and 3 kev , and then rises again near the fe k@xmath13/k@xmath49 region .",
    "the variation is small ( of order 10% ) , but it is statistically significant .",
    "both the fractional depth of the gaussian and its width increase with energy .",
    "the product of the two ( proportional to the fraction of the emission blocked by the secondary ) actually varies significantly with energy , roughly by 50% , which we plot in fig.[fig : depths ] .    due to the energy dependence of the modulation ,",
    "some caution is in order when fitting global spectral models .",
    "we decided to divide the lightcurve into 5 parts ( shown in fig.[fig : lcfit ] ) labelled a ( the eclipse ) through e. the detailed spectral fitting we have performed was carried out for each of these phases to test the dependence of different parameters on orbital phase .",
    "we have also investigated the dependence of the _",
    "pca_colours on phase .",
    "the strongest variations are found in the soft energy bands [ 2.53.7 kev/3.75 kev and 3.75 kev/56.2 kev ] , where we find variations of order 30% to 50% , with phase a being softest and phase d being hardest . in the more energetic bands [ 56.2 kev/6.210.2 kev and 6.210.2 kev/10.214.6 kev ] ,",
    "the variation of colour with phase is weaker , i.e. , of order 10% . these results are consistent with the analysis of _ bepposax _  data by p00 ; however , the signal is not nearly as strong and as indicative as , for example , in the case of her x-1 .",
    "the strong phase - dependent behaviour in that case has been interpreted as being due to neutral hydrogen absorption and electron scattering in a large column depth medium @xcite .    as a starting point",
    "we fitted test models to the complete data set ( not divided into phases ) .",
    "as with the previous analyses cited in the introduction , simple one - component models can not produce a satisfactory fit neither a single blackbody , nor a thermal plasma , nor a cutoff power law adequately fit the data . adding a second component can improve the fit significantly .",
    "we found that the combination of a disc blackbody @xcite with either a simple blackbody or a cutoff power law ( plus a gaussian to model the iron k@xmath50 line ) did produce marginally acceptable fits ( residuals are plotted in fig.[fig : allmodels_thin ] ) .",
    "however , better fits can be achieved with physically more plausible models , which are consistent with the strong constraints that light curve fitting puts on the geometry of the system , which we will outline below .",
    "if the central object in x  1822@xmath0371  is in fact a neutron star , any thermal radiation from its surface is completely obscured by the accretion disc ( hellier & mason 1989 ) .",
    "the observed x - rays are produced either in the disc itself or in the corona .",
    "lightcurve fitting indicates that the emission comes from a large extended source , and the ( essentially required ) power law component in the spectra supports the notion that the corona is the main radaition source .",
    "we based our spectral fitting on this assumption and investigated two possible , though not exclusive , spectral models , one with an optically thick corona and one with an optically thin corona .    _ the optically thick case : _ we expect the spectral signature of the hot corona to be of power law shape , with an exponential high energy cutoff produced by comptonization , as is appropriate for many lmxbs @xcite .",
    "( here a cutoff at low energies would indicate a relatively cool corona . )",
    "if the corona is optically thick , the spectrum will not contain any component originating from the central object , as such radiation will have been completely reprocessed .",
    "the accretion disk is nearly edge on and its atmosphere will partially cover the coronal emission . to account for this effect , we used a model consisting of a partially absorbed cutoff power law and an iron line .",
    "the partial absorption is modelled by co - adding an unabsorbed and an absorbed cutoff powerlaw with equal parameters .",
    "the normalization of the absorbed component , however , is multiplied by a constant , @xmath51 , which is related to the absorption fraction , @xmath52 , by @xmath53 the absorption column in the partial absorption model is treated as a free parameter , and we include both electron scattering and neutral hydrogen absorption modelled using the cross sections of bauciska - church & mccammon .",
    "our spectral model is , of course , a simplification because in any natural situation a range of absorbing columns will occur .",
    "higher levels of detail , however , are not warranted given our understanding of this source and the limits of the x - ray data .",
    "having found a satisfactory overall spectral fit , we used the phase selected spectra to optimize the fits .",
    "we assumed that the physical parameters in the emitting region do not change from phase to phase and that the changes in the spectrum are entirely due to changes in obscuration of the corona both by the completely opaque disk and the partial absorption .",
    "we thus tied the powerlaw slope and the cutoff energy to be the same for all five phases , so that in the fitting process these parameters vary in unison .",
    "similarly , we tied the iron line energy of all five phases together and , for lack of high spectral resolution from the _ pca _  which dominates the statistics in this region , fixed the iron line width to 0.1kev",
    ". the foreground absorption column was also tied together for all five phases .",
    "having combined the two _ sis _",
    "data sets and the two _ gis _  data sets , we were left with a total of 15 data sets , which we then fit simultaneously .",
    "the results of the joint fitting are presented in table[tab : thick ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "it is worth noting that there is a correlation between the power law normalization ( overall count rate ) , the internal absorption column , and the absorption fraction , with the internal absorption column being greatest in the brightest phases .",
    "note also that the equivalent width of the iron line is very large ( @xmath56 ev , much larger than in the optically thin case ) .",

    "models of the x  1822@xmath0371  lightcurve , for both the optical and x - ray energy bands , have been presented by white & holt , mason & crdova , and hellier & mason . essentially , these models have taken emission from an extended central region ( x - rays ) plus emission from a disc and disc rim ( optical ) , and then considered the effects of obscuration by both the secondary star ( assumed to be roche lobe filling ) and by the accretion disc rim",
    ". the disc rim has been modelled by placing nodes symmetrically above and below the disc mid - plane at a fixed disc radius but at variable heights and phases along the disc edge .",
    "the disc rim profile is then linearly extrapolated at intermediate phases .",
    "fit parameters for these models have included the radius of the x - ray emitting corona , usually assumed spherical for simplicity , the heights and phases of the rim nodes , the mass of the compact object , and the inclination angle of the system with respect to our line of sight ( see hellier & mason 1989 ) .    here",
    "we elaborate upon these models in two ways .",
    "first , due to the excellent statistics of _ rxte _ , we are able to divide the _ rxte _",
    "lightcurves into five distinct energy bands covering _ pca _  pha channels 811 , 1215 , 1619 , 2027 , and 2832 ( 2.94.4kev , 4.45.8kev , 5.87.2kev , 7.210.2kev , and 10.212.0kev , respectively ) .",
    "we fit each of these energy band lightcurves simultaneously .",
    "second , we model both an optically thin and an optically thick spherical corona .",
    "specifically , we model the x - ray emission via a uniform emissivity or a uniform surface brightness . we do not expect ( and as we confirm below ; see also hellier & mason 1989 ) strong differences between the two cases . given a completely edge - on viewing angle , for a given disc rim height the fraction of emission that is obscured and the emission - weighted mean height of the unobscured radiation are nearly identical for both uniform surface brightness and uniform emissivity . in our fits ,",
    "we allow both the overall flux normalization and the radius of the sphere to vary for each energy band ; however , the disc rim parameters ( radius of the disc , @xmath144 , node heights , @xmath145 , and node phases , @xmath146 ) are held fixed .",
    "additional fit parameters are the mass of the compact object ( @xmath147 ) and the inclination of the system with respect to our line of sight ( @xmath148 ) .    in part",
    "these parameters are determined by utilizing the fact that x  1822@xmath0371   has a known binary period of @xmath149hr and a measured projected primary orbital velocity of @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "we highlight the systematic uncertainties in our fit parameters by varying this latter parameter by @xmath151 ( see cowley et al . 1982 ) .",
    "furthermore , we search for model fits with @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "that is , we fit models for a ` white dwarf ' , ` canonical neutron star ' , and ` low mass black hole ' primary .",
    "the latter primary mass yields a secondary mass consistent with roche lobe overflow from a main sequence star ( see below ) .    in order to better interpret the results of our fits , we first present estimates of the characteristic accretion system size and mass scales . defining the secondary to primary mass ratio ,",
    "@xmath155 , newton s laws give @xmath156 for @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 . henceforth , these parameter values shall be referred to as the ` nominal parameters ' . as noted by mason et al . , this mass ratio is roughly half that expected from the mass - period relationship for a lower main sequence secondary .",
    "if instead we choose @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath159 , one obtains a secondary mass of @xmath162 , as one would expect for the period - mass relationship of a main sequence star @xcite .",

    ".    the lack of high frequency variability may be due to scattering over large distances and/or optical depths ( see nowak & vaughan 1996 , and references therein ) . specifically ,",
    "if the variable lightcurve is first passed through a scattering medium of optical depth @xmath220 and size @xmath221 , one expects a cutoff in the power spectrum at a frequency , @xmath222 , given by @xmath223 ~~. \\label{eq : cut}\\ ] ] thus , given @xmath224 cm , the cutoff frequency should be @xmath225$]hz , even for @xmath226 .",

    "several key issues about x  1822@xmath0371  have surfaced in the earlier sections , which we will now address , along with some open questions which relate to earlier studies of this object .",
    "as we have shown , several fundamentally different models can explain the _ asca _  and _ rxte _  spectra almost equally well .",
    "while formally satisfactory , the spectra we presented in  [ sec : spectra ] still show some systematic residues , which could be removed by addition of features like absorption edges and lines .",
    "for example , p00 argue that there is clear evidence for an edge around 1.3kev .",
    "we do see a hint of such an effect , especially in the optically thick case , but it is not clear if the origin is really an absorption edge .",
    "the same feature might be produced by an emission line complex at 1 kev ( as demonstrated in the optically thin case , where the addition of a raymond - smith plasma removed the systematic residues at the low energy end ) .",
    "we also note that the edge in the fits by p00 falls very close to the position where two major spectral components ( blackbody and comptonization spectrum ) cross in their fits .",
    "similarly , the structure of the iron line region is all but clear . as remarked by p00 ,",
    "the ratio of the two narrow lines we fit to the data is off from the theoretical value expected for k@xmath50 to k@xmath143 , but ionized line emission could explain this fact . in the optically thin models",
    "the ionization parameter in the corona is much larger than one , which would strengthen such an argument .",
    "both of these questions will undoubtedly be answered by upcoming _",
    "xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  observations .      both in spectral modelling and in fitting the light curve , we used two general models , based on whether the corona is optically thick or thin .",
    "we found that both light curve and spectrum are degenerate with respect to this distinction , and optically thick and thin models reproduce these data equally well",
    ". we will now discuss the physical interpretation of the two cases ( see also  [ sec : wind ] ) .",
    "* in the optically thick case we modelled the spectrum as a partially absorbed power law , produced by reprocessed radiation from the corona , passing through a column of cold gas ( the atmosphere of the outer disc ) . from the spectral fit we can then deduce the covering fraction and optical depth of the partial absorber .",
    "these numbers are given in table [ tab : thick ] .",
    "+ we can understand the above mentioned correlation between the partial absorption column , the absorption fraction , and the overall flux through the following picture : the x - rays originate from an approximately spherical corona ( at uniform surface brightness ) .",
    "the accretion disc rim is completely opaque and responsible for most of the modulation in the light curve , due to differences in its height ( and thus its covering fraction ) . above the accretion disc ,",
    "an atmosphere of cold gas absorbs / scatters a fraction of the light from the corona behind it .",
    "the geometric covering fraction would roughly be given by the ratio of the atmosphere s scale height to the coronal radius .",
    "as the rim height changes through the binary phases , the covering fraction of the partial absorber also changes ( see table  [ tab : thick ] ) .",
    "+ higher latitudes of the corona are relatively less absorbed , thus for binary phases where the the disc rim is higher , the ratio of unabsorbed to absorbed coronal flux will be greater . at the same time , the average column depth of the absorber should be smaller , since the gas density is lower at higher latitudes .",
    "the trend in fig .",
    "[ fig : depths ] can also be understood this way : the absorbed component of the power law contributes primarily hard x - rays to the spectrum .",
    "since this part of the spectrum originates at low latitudes , it is most affected by obscuration , thus the larger modulation depths at high energies .",
    "the implied scale heights and column depths of table [ tab : thick ] are consistent with what would be expected from an x - ray heated atmosphere above the disc between the edge of the corona and the disc rim @xcite .",
    "+ the fact that we only see a small fraction of the luminosity inferred from the orbital evolution can be explained if the corona is optically thick to scattering while relatively optically thin to absorption . in that case",
    "it will act as a mirror and transmit only a fraction @xmath229 of the incident radiation . for a ratio of observed to inferred luminosity of @xmath230 , modulo a geometric covering factor",
    ", this would imply an optical depth of @xmath231 ( which justifies the assumption of an optically thick corona in this model ) . as we will discuss below ( see  [ sec : wind ] ) , a large fraction of the energy could also leave the system in a wind ( adiabatic inflow - outflow solution , adios ; blandford & begelman 1999 ) or , in the case of a black hole primary , disappear down the horizon ( optically thick advection dominated accretion flow , adaf ; narayan & yi 1994 ) . + table [ tab : thick ] shows that the equivalent widths of the iron lines are rather large , of order 250 ev .",
    "a simple estimate of the expected ew produced solely within the partial absorber by the incident coronal spectrum is of the order of 50 ev .",
    "uncertainties in the metallicity or the geometry of the system ( i.e. , if the partial absorber is subject to a larger flux than seen by the observer ) might account for such a discrepancy .",
    "note also that the partial covering model introduces an iron absorption edge at 7.1 kev , which is leading in part to the large fitted equivalent widths . as noted by p00 and references therein",
    ", the line ratios are still problematic if the higher energy line is an fe k@xmath49 line , as opposed to ionized fe k@xmath13 . models of resonant scattering of the fe k@xmath13 line by the partial absorber in the outer disc rim region may help explain some of this discrepancy .",
    "finally , we note that the optically thick corona itself could well be the origin of strong iron line emission . *",
    "the key question for the optically thin case is whether or not there is unambiguous evidence for blackbody emission from the surface of the compact object that is scattered into our line of sight .",
    "related to this is the question of whether or not there is clear evidence for coronal line emission , i.e. a thermal plasma component . as the optically thick model , with partial absorption , fits the spectrum adequately , evidence for these components can not be claimed to be unambiguous . ignoring the partial covering ( due to the limits of our data and models ) , however , these components are seen to be allowed in the fits , thus there absence can not be definitively shown either .",
    "+ assuming the optically thin scenario to be correct , the x - ray emission is again produced in the corona .",
    "the blackbody part of the continuum is produced either on the neutron star surface ( if the central object is in fact a neutron star ) or the inner disc , and is then scattered into our line of sight by the corona .",
    "the power law part of the spectrum stems from radiation that is comptonized in the corona .",
    "if the corona is optically thin , the fraction of the total x - ray luminosity that reaches the observer is @xmath232 .",
    "the optical depth of the corona would thus be @xmath233 , once again modulo the geometric covering factor .",
    "we note again that a fraction of the accretion energy might be carried away in a wind or advected ( in the case of a black hole primary ) .",
    "+ note that the modulation seen in the power law is stronger than the modulation seen in the blackbody .",
    "we can interpret this dependence geometrically if we further postulate that the power law emission is produced at lower coronal latitudes , in which case a larger fraction of it would be subject to obscuration both by the rim and the companion . the variations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : depths ] would be natural in such a scenario , since the black body component emanates from the whole corona , is relatively less modulated , and contributes most strongly at low and intermediate energies .",
    "again , however , a partial covering model may be applicable for the optically thin case as well as for the optically thick case .",
    "+ the fitted iron line in this case is weaker than for the optically thick case , but due to the neglect of partial absorption this model does not contain an intrinsic absorption feature around 7 kev . all other remarks with respect to the line strength in the optically thick case",
    "hold here too .",
    "both these models can explain the basic features of light curve and spectrum , we therefore have no way to chose one over the other .",
    "in fact , reality might fall in between these two cases .",
    "one might imagine a model where the optical depth of the corona decreases with height .",
    "we would thus see scattered blackbody radiation from high latitudes and a partially absorbed power law from the optically thick parts closer to the disc .",
    "hopefully , future x - ray and optical observations will resolve this degeneracy .",
    "lacking detections of x - ray pulses or type i x - ray bursts that would unambiguously point toward a neutron star primary , we must rely on more indirect arguments for determining its nature . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : lcfit ] , the fits to the x - ray lightcurves are ambiguous in this regard . of the possibilities , we find the white dwarf primary scenario the least likely for two principle reasons . first is the fact that we observe an x - ray flux of order @xmath234 .",
    "[ eq : mdot ] , assuming no mass loss and a more typical white dwarf radiative efficiency of @xmath235 , would lead to a total accretion luminosity of @xmath236 .",
    "although by assuming a white dwarf primary we decrease the inferred size of the disc and thereby decrease the inferred distance @xcite and luminosity by a factor of @xmath237 and @xmath238 , respectively , we would still require that we are viewing of order 100% of the accretion luminosity despite the presence of a scattering corona and the near edge - on inclination of the system .",
    "second is the implied mass of the secondary , @xmath239 , which is slightly small given the then inferred roche lobe radius of the secondary , @xmath240 .",
    "again we note , however , that if the lower values of @xmath206 km  s@xmath205 and @xmath241 km  s@xmath205 are correct @xcite , than a white dwarf primary is the preferred model .    of the oter",
    "two possibilities , neutron star or black hole , there is little to distinguish between them . given the edge - on inclination and the implied large scattering paths , it is not surprising that we do not detect any variability associated with a neutron star spin period , as discussed in  [ sec : var ]",
    ". furthermore , given little or no mass loss , the implied accretion rate onto the neutron star would be sufficient to suppress any type i bursting behaviour ( bildsten 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore expect a neutron star and low mass black hole to look nearly identical .",
    "distinguishing between these two scenarios , therefore , will require a combination of more careful observations of the secondary and identifying a plausible evolutionary scenario for this system .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : orbit ] , the implied mass transfer time scale is @xmath242 , which is compatible with mass transfer on a thermal time scale ( see kalogera & webbink 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "one interesting possibility is that we are viewing the x  1822@xmath0371  system towards the end of a thermal time scale mass transfer phase @xcite .",
    "specific scenarios have been discussed for cyg  x-2 @xcite and ss  433 @xcite . at the onset of mass transfer",
    "the system begins with a mass ratio @xmath243 . as the secondary loses mass , both the binary separation and the secondary roche lobe shrink .",
    "a common envelope phase is avoided by strong mass loss from the primary , perhaps in an advection dominated accretion phase characterized by a strong wind emanating from large radii @xcite . even as @xmath165 decreases below unity",
    ", mass transfer can continue to be driven on the thermal time scale . for the cyg  x-2 system ( known to be a neutron star primary ; smale 1998 ) , it is hypothesised that the system began with an @xmath244 secondary , but now shows an @xmath245 secondary with a radius @xmath246 @xcite .    the above mentioned systems , however , can not be exactly analogous to that of the x  1822@xmath0371  system .",
    "cyg  x-2 , for example , has a 9.84day orbital period and a secondary luminosity of @xmath247 , both far larger than in x  1822@xmath0371 . in the optical bands ,",
    "aside from x - ray heating of the secondary , it has traditionally been assumed that the x  1822@xmath0371  emission is dominated by the accretion disc and disc rim , with the total optical luminosity being @xmath248 @xcite .",
    "likewise , models of the uv emission have been presumed to be dominated by the disc and the corona @xcite , although perhaps the far uv allows the greatest room for significant contributions from the secondary .",
    "in addition , obtaining the currently observed 5.57hr orbital period via mass transfer alone requires that during the earlier epoch wherein @xmath249 , the orbital period was even shorter .",
    "the current 5.57hr orbital period might require an extended epoch of magnetic braking of the secondary ( rappaport et al .",
    "1983 ; taam 1983 ; pylyser & savonije 1988 ; and references therein ) .    as discussed in the above references , magnetic braking is expected only to be effective for secondaries that do not have a fully convective envelope .",
    "although strong mass transfer rates are possible before mass loss leads to such an envelope , this epoch is only expected to last @xmath250@xmath251 years @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with our previous estimates of the lifetime of the x  1822@xmath0371  system .",
    "we note that during this strong mass transfer phase , one generally expects the secondary to exceed its main sequence radius @xcite .",
    "if we define the ratio of the secondary s roche lobe radius to its main sequence radius as @xmath252 , then given the discussion of  [ sec : lcfit ] we can approximate the mass of the primary as @xmath253 thus , @xmath254 allows for a neutron star mass @xmath255 .",
    "finally we note that in addition to any mass loss associated with magnetic braking , further strong mass loss from such a system as suggested by king & begelman leads to another explanation ( in addition to postulating that the coronal optical depth @xmath256 or @xmath257 ) for the fact that we observe only @xmath258 of the accretion luminosity inferred for an efficiency of @xmath259 . `",
    "adios ' models wherein most of the accreted mass never reaches the surface or event horizon of the primary @xcite allow for either a neutron star or black hole primary .",
    "in such a scenario , the energy of viscous dissipation is not efficiently radiated away from the system and must be carried away via a wind .",
    "viscous dissipation occurs out to the circularization radius , which is the inferred radius of the corona from our fits of  [ sec : lcfit ] , and thus dissipation may in part be responsible for the presence of the corona ( which in this case could be an adios wind ) .",
    "we have presented observations of the low mass x - ray binary x  1822@xmath0371 taken with both _ rxte _  and _ asca_. we considered two broad band fits , which we took as approximately representing ` optically thick ' and ` optically thin ' coronal emission .",
    "either model fit the data nearly equally well .",
    "likewise , the x - ray lightcurves folded on the orbital period were also equally well - fit by optically thick or thin models , and furthermore these fits could not distinguish among a white dwarf , neutron star , or black hole primary . high spectral resolution _ asca _",

    "data selection criteria were that the source elevation was larger than 10@xmath260 above the earth limb and data measured within 30minutes of passages of the south atlantic anomaly or during times of high particle background ( as expressed by the `` electron ratio '' being greater than 0.1 ) were ignored . to increase the signal to noise level of the data",
    ", we restricted the analysis to the first anode layer of the proportional counter units ( pcus ) where most source photons are detected ( the particle background is almost independent of the anode layer ) , and we combined the data from all five pcus .",
    "we only used data where all five pcus were turned on , which was nearly the entire observation .    for spectral fitting , we limited the energy range of the _ pca _  data from 3 to 30kev to take into account the calibration uncertainty of the _ pca _  we applied the channel dependent systematic uncertainties described by wilms et al .. these uncertainties were determined from a power - law fit to an observation of the crab nebula and pulsar taking into account all anode chains ; however",
    ", they do also provide a good estimate for the first anode layer only since most of the photons are detected in this layer .",
    "background subtraction of the _ pca _  data was performed using the ` skyvle ' model , as for our previous studies of gx  339@xmath04 @xcite .",
    "we extracted data from the two solid state detectors ( _ sis_0 , _",
    "sis_1 ) and the two gas detectors ( _ gis_2 , _",
    "gis_3 ) onboard _ asca _  by using the standard ftools as described in the asca data reduction guide @xcite .",
    "we chose circular extraction regions with radii of @xmath261arcmin for the sis detectors , and @xmath262arcmin for the _ gis _  detectors .",
    "we excluded approximately the central 1arcmin to avoid the possibility of photon pileup .",
    "we used the sisclean and gisclean tools ( with default values ) to remove hot and flickering pixels .",
    "we filtered the data with the strict cleaning criteria outlined by brandt et al .",
    "; however , we took the larger value of 7@xmath263 for the rigidity .",
    "we rebinned the spectral files so that each energy bin contained a minimum of 20photons .",
    "we retained _ sis _",
    "data in the 0.5 to 10kev range and _ gis _  data in the 1 to 10kev range .",
    "the background was measured from rectangular regions on the two edges of the chip farthest from the source ( _ sis _",
    "data ) , or from annuli with inner radii @xmath264arcmin ( _ gis _  data ) . these data were cleaned and filtered in the same manner as the source files .",
    "note that for the simultaneous _ asca_/_rxte _",
    "observations , we combined the two _ sis _  detectors into a single spectrum , and we combined the two _",
    "gis_detectors into a single spectrum , properly weighting the response matrices .",
    "we accounted for the cross - calibration uncertainties of the _ sis _  and _ gis_instruments relative to each other and relative to _ rxte _  by introducing a multiplicative constant for each detector in all of our fits .",
    "note also that the phase filtering option in xselect produces flawed results , so the time filtering option was used instead to produce phase selected spectra ."
