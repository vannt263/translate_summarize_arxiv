    "the milky way contains @xmath3 of stars .",
    "approximately 90% of those stars lie in the disk , 9% in the bulge , and 1% in the halo @xcite .",
    "however , these structures did not form their stars en masse .",
    "the sites of star formation are far less massive than any of these components .",
    "for example , star formation in the disk occurs in open clusters , which typically have just @xmath4 of stars @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies , which may have built the bulge and halo @xcite , range in mass from @xmath5 ( e.g. , segue  1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to more than @xmath6 ( e.g. , fornax ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pockets of star formation within the dwarf galaxies likely contained just as little mass as the open clusters in the galactic disk .",
    "dynamical processes assemble the many disparate sites of star formation into the primary galactic components , such as the disk , bulge , and halo .",
    "therefore , the key to discovering the origins of stars lies in studying stellar populations in less massive structures .",
    "the dwarf galaxies that orbit the milky way ( mw ) present the opportunity to study the formation of stellar populations most similar to the mw stellar halo . unlike most open clusters , dwarf galaxies contain old , metal - poor stars .",
    "unlike most globular clusters , dwarf galaxies enable the study of temporally extended star formation , which ultimately results in chemical evolution .",
    "furthermore , galaxies of this class probably created at least some of the stellar halo of the mw by gravitational dissolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if so , then the stellar population of the present mw halo contains a mixture of many different galaxies .",
    "the individual stellar populations are difficult to disentangle , especially in the inner halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "surviving dwarf galaxies may offer a look at single , though evolved , counterparts to an accreted component of the halo .",
    "the stellar populations in surviving and accreted dwarfs differ because the accretion time is correlated with stellar mass and therefore star formation history .",
    "nonetheless , the observed abundance differences can be compared with models of surviving galaxies and hierarchically formed halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , the halo may have been created by a combination of monolithic collapse @xcite and hierarchical assembly .",
    "comparisons of the abundances of dwarf galaxy stars and the chemodynamics of halo stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that only some of the stars in the halo are consistent with accretion of dwarf galaxies similar to the surviving dwarfs .",
    "although it is clear that the nearby halo stars have different abundance patterns than dwarf satellite galaxies , the number of dwarf galaxy stars with published multi - element abundance measurements is less than for the halo .",
    "the relative distance of dwarf galaxies compared to the nearest observable halo stars has prevented the sample of dwarf galaxy abundances from growing as fast as for halo stars .",
    "studying the role of dwarf galaxies in building the halo would benefit from a larger sample of dwarf galaxy elemental abundances .",
    "( @xcite @xcite points out that even the halo abundances have not been well - sampled because the more distant halo stars have not been observed nearly as completely as nearby halo stars . )",
    "stellar elemental abundances reveal many characteristics of the stellar population of a galaxy .",
    "its metallicity distribution , usually represented by the stellar iron content , is a function of the galaxy s total mass , the amount of gas infall and outflow , the chemical yield of supernovae , whether the galaxy formed out of gas pre - enriched with metals , and other variables . beyond the one - dimensional metallicity distribution , the ratios of other elements to iron reflect other details of the star formation history . in particular , the ratios of alpha elements , such as magnesium , to iron depend on the duration and intensity of star formation .",
    "a large sample of multi - element abundances for individual stars in dwarf galaxies would be a useful tool in studying star formation in small systems .",
    "however , obtaining elemental abundances is expensive .",
    "high - quality , high - resolution spectroscopy ( hrs , @xmath7 ) allows the measurements of tens of elements to precisions of @xmath8  dex for stars with @xmath9 .",
    "this magnitude limit restricts the measurement of elemental abundances to the upper 12 magnitudes of the red giant branch for most mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "in addition , most current high - resolution spectrographs operate on one star at a time . the exposure time required for adequate signal to derive accurate abundance measurements has limited the sample of stars in intact mw dwarf satellite galaxies ( excluding sagittarius ) with published high - resolution spectroscopy to fewer than 200 .    with current technology , a statistical analysis of the elemental abundance distributions in dwarf galaxies",
    "must rely on medium - resolution spectroscopy ( mrs , @xmath10 ) .",
    "mrs relaxes the magnitude limit to @xmath11 while permitting multiplexing of more than one hundred stars in one exposure . building a large sample of multi - element abundances in mw dwarf galaxies",
    "requires both of these capabilities .",
    "the disadvantages of mrs are that fewer elements are accessible than with hrs , and the measurements are less precise .",
    "@xcite presented one of the first applications of mrs to dwarf galaxy metallicity distributions .",
    "they based their metallicity measurements on a calibration of infrared calcium triplet equivalent width to [ fe / h ]  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , spectral synthesis is required to measure the abundances of multiple elements .",
    "several recent spectral synthesis - based studies have employed mrs to begin building the sample of abundances in mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite discovered extremely metal - poor ( @xmath12 } } < -3 $ ] ) stars in the ultra - faint dwarf galaxies using keck / deimos spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite measured fe , mg , ca , and ti abundances for 27 stars in the leo  ii galaxy using keck / lris spectroscopy .",
    "finally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) measured fe , mg , si , ca , and ti abundances for 388 stars in the sculptor dwarf galaxy using keck / deimos spectroscopy .    in this article , we present a catalog of elemental abundance measurements of 2961  stars in eight mw dwarf galaxies .",
    "the technique is very similar to that developed by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we summarize our work and discuss our articles that interpret these data in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "we targeted individual stars in twelve monometallic gcs , listed in table  [ tab : targets ] .",
