    "accreting magnetized neutron stars are an ideal cosmic laboratory for high energy relativistic physics .",
    "cyclotron resonance features are the signature of the presence of a superstrong magnetic field , following the first discovery in her x-1 ( trmper et al .",
    "@xcite ) . these features are due to the discrete landau energy levels for motion of free electrons perpendicular to the field in presence of a locally uniform superstrong magnetic field .",
    "a slight deviation from a pure harmonic relationship in the spacing of the different levels is expected due to relativistic effects ( @xmath0 , e.g. araya and harding @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the detection of these features in the emitted x ",
    "ray spectra is in principle a direct measure of the field intensity .",
    "+ as the number of sensitive measurements in the hard x  ray interval ( above @xmath1 10 kev ) is continuously growing , a sample is available to search for possible correlations between the observed parameters .",
    "a detailed modeling is difficult and a parametrized shape of the continuum still is not available from theoretical models , but substantial advances in our understanding of the radiation transport in strongly magnetized atmospheres were done in the last decade ( e.g. alexander et al .",
    "@xcite , alexander and mszros @xcite , araya and harding @xcite , isenberg et al .",
    "@xcite , nelson et al .",
    "@xcite ) . some of these new results focused on the properties of the cyclotron resonance features observed in the spectra of accreting x  ray pulsars . in this report",
    "we discuss the current status of the measurements of cyclotron lines , with emphasis on the possible correlations between observable parameters .",
    "the satellite has observed all the bright persistent and three bright transient ( recurrent ) accreting x  ray pulsars .",
    "apart from the case of x persei ( di salvo et al .",
    "@xcite ) , a source with a luminosity substantially lower than the other sources in the sample , the spectra observed by can be empirically described using the classical power  law  plus  cutoff spectral function by white et al . @xcite .",
    "the sensitive broad band observations also allowed the detailed characterization of low energy components below a few kev ( like in her x1 , dal fiume et al .",
    "@xcite , and in 4u162667 , orlandini et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the detection of absorption features in the hard x  ray range of the spectra , interpreted as cyclotron resonance features .    a summary of the properties of the broad band spectra and of the cyclotron lines as measured with is reported in dal fiume et al .",
    "@xcite . from these measurements we obtained evidence of a correlation between the centroid energy of the feature and its width .",
    "this correlation is presented and discussed elsewhere ( dal fiume et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a straightforward parameter to be obtained from observations is the transparency in the line , defined as the ratio between the transmitted observed flux and the integrated flux from the continuum without the absorption feature .",
    "this ratio likely depends on the harmonic number of the feature we are observing ( e.g. wang et al .",
    "@xcite ) and on the physical parameters of the specific accretion column . from an observational point of view , this ratio is strongly affected by the modelization of the `` continuum '' shape , that is by the spectral shape used to describe the differential broad band photon number spectrum . in figure 1",
    "we report the observed transparencies obtained dividing the observed by the expected flux , both integrated in a @xmath2 interval around the line centroid ( here @xmath3 is the gaussian width of the measured cyclotron feature ) . to further emphasize the uncertainty in this estimate , we added a 10% error to the data .",
    "the purely statistical uncertainties are substantially smaller .",
    "this measured transparency is related to a simple physical parameter , the opacity to photons with energy approximately equal to the cyclotron resonance energy .",
    "however the emerging integral flux and the shape of the line itself are non trivially related to the radiation transport in this energy interval , a rather difficult problem to be solved .",
    "+ from the phenomenological point of view , one can observe that the measured transparencies cluster around 0.50.6 , with the notable exception of cen x3 .",
    "the influence of the magnetic field intensity on the broad band spectral shape is debated .",
    "early attempts to estimate a possible dependence of electron temperature , and therefore of broad band spectral shape , on the magnetic field intensity were done by harding et al @xcite .",
    "actually they conclude that _ `` the equilibrium atmospheres have temperatures and optical depths that are very sensitive to the strength of the surface magnetic field''_. if this is the case and if the broad band spectral hardness is related , as one could naively assume , to the temperature of the atmosphere , some correlation between this hardness and the cyclotron line energy should appear in data .",
    "this seems to be the case shown in figure 2 .",
    "here we report the ratio between photon fluxes in two `` hard '' bands ( the flux in 20100 kev divided by the flux in 715 kev ) versus the cyclotron line centroid .",
    "the ratio between the two fluxes is affected by the choice of the continuum , as in figure 1 .",
    "we therefore also in this case added 10% error bars that indicate this uncertainty .",
    "the statistical errors are substantially smaller",
    ". + the number of sources in this plot is still very limited and therefore one can not exclude that this apparent correlation is merely due to the limited size of the sample .",
    "nevertheless the apparent correlation is in the right direction , i.e. harder spectra are observed for higher field intensities .",
    "+ we parenthetically add that no cyclotron resonance feature was observed in the pulse  phase averaged spectra of the two hardest sources of this class observed with ( gx1 + 4 israel et al . @xcite and gs1843 + 00 piraino et al .",
    "if this correlation proves to be correct , this may suggest that cyclotron resonance features in these two sources should be searched at the upper limit of the energy band or beyond .      in conclusion , even if no complete , parametric theoretical approach to model the observed spectra of accreting x  ray pulsars is still available , some quantitative measures of parameters of hot plasmas in superstrong magnetic fields are possible .",
    "+ modeling the transparency in the cyclotron resonance feature is a complex problem .",
    "further information will be extracted from maps of this transparency as a function of pulse phase .",
    "+ the correlation between spectral hardness and field intensity is in agreement with theoretical models .",
    "this correlation , if confirmed , can be used as a rough estimate of the magnetic field intensity from the measured spectral hardness .",
    "this research is supported by agenzia spaziale italiana ( asi ) and consiglio nazionale delle ricerche ( cnr ) of italy .",
