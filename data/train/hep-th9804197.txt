    "possible solutions of this problem will be discussed after clarifying the meaning of the first requirement @xmath50 .",
    "the transformation law of @xmath51 under gauge transformation is changed , but the change can be compensated by introducing the _ covariant derivative _ : dgdg+ag - gb , ( dg)=(dg)^-1 , where @xmath52 are _ gauge fields _ ( lie algebra valued 1forms ) .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath53 transforms homogeneously under local transformations , provided the gauge fields transform according to a=(a + d)^-1 , b=(b + d)^-1 . having defined @xmath53 , one can try to gauge the wznw action by replacing @xmath54 , i.e. by replacing 1form @xmath55 with the corresponding covariant 1form @xmath56 : vg^-1dg = v + g^-1ag -b , v=v^-1 .",
    "it is also useful to define the field strengths , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which transform as follows : @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",

    "the first term @xmath61 is both @xmath50 gauge invariant , and @xmath62 defined over @xmath3 , so that it represents an acceptable gauge invariant action .",

    "however , this form is in general not exact , so that @xmath64 can not be expressed as an integral over @xmath3 ; therefore , it can not be used as part of the @xmath6model action on @xmath3 .",
    "we shall now analyze some additional restrictions under which an acceptable gauge extension of @xmath44 _ can _ be defined .",

    "now , one should observe that the term @xmath67 is gauge invariant , therefore it can be removed from @xmath68 , leaving us with the gauge invariant combination @xmath69 . since @xmath66 is a three ",

    "can one find a mechanism that compensates this non  invariance , and yields an acceptable gauge invariant extension of the wznw action ?    in the analogous four ",
    "dimensional model witten @xcite solved the problem by requiring the constraint @xmath72 on the gauge group @xmath47 , sufficient for gauge invariance . in string models",
    "one can simply remove @xmath66 without assuming any constraint on @xmath47 , while the gauge invariance of the theory is ensured by the presence of some additional field in the action , with  anomalous \" transformation law @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall solve the @xmath66problem by considering a gauge extension of the action , describing a system of _ two _ simple wznw models , in which the problematic @xmath66 term in the first sector will cancel the corresponding term in the second sector , leading to the theory which is both @xmath50 gauge invariant and @xmath62 defined on @xmath3 .",
    "the construction goes as follows .",
    "we start with the formal extension of @xmath68 , as obtained in eq .. next , using gauge invariance of @xmath73 we define a simpler gauge invariant",
    "action : @xmath74 it is now easy to see that an acceptable gauge extension of the action for the wznw system can be defined by i(1,2)=i(g_1,a , b)-i(g_2,a , b ) , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are different fields , belonging to the same representation of @xmath0 . indeed , since @xmath77 does not depend on @xmath7 , the contribution of two @xmath66 terms to @xmath78 vanishes .",
    "thus , the gauge invariant action can be written in the simpler form [ 3.9 ] i(1,2)=i^r(g_1,a , b)-i^r(g_2,a , b ) , [ 3.9-a ] where we clearly see that it is an action defined on @xmath3 .",
    "the reduced action can be written as i^r(g , a , b ) = i(g ) + _  , [ 3.9-b ] where the @xmath7independent term @xmath79 in @xmath80 is ignored , as its contribution to sectors 1 and 2 in ( [ 3.9-a ] ) is canceled .",
    "the absence of this term implies that @xmath78 does not depend on @xmath81 and @xmath82 [ see eq . ] , i.e. selfdual and anti - selfdual parts of the gauge fields @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "as we shall see , the absence of these parts will greatly influence the dynamical structure of the gauged wznw system .",
    "in this section we shall specify the gauge group , and derive an explicit expression for the gauge action ( [ 3.9 ] ) in terms of the group coordinates @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "using now the matrix @xmath88 , that defines the adjoint representation of the gauge group , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 ( appendix b ) , the reduced action takes the form i^r(g , a , b)=i(g ) + 2_d^2_ab .",
    "as we mentioned , the action @xmath78 does not contain variables @xmath91 , which implies the existence of an _ extra _ gauge symmetry , allowing an arbitrary change of the absent components .",
    "this is a specific feature of the action for the wznw system . to simplify further considerations",
    "we shall fix this symmetry by imposing the following gauge conditions : a_-=0 , b_+=0 .",
    "up to now we did not specify the gauge group @xmath47 .",
    "we could take @xmath47 to be the whole @xmath2 , but for our purposes this is not necessary .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 is a subgroup of @xmath2 , defined by h= h_+h_- , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are subgroups of @xmath0 defined by the generators @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "when compared to @xmath2 , our choice means that the gauge fields should be restricted as follows : a^=0 , b^=0 .",
    "the gauge symmetry @xmath85 is defined in terms of the following gauge fields and gauge parameters : @xmath96 gauge transformations of dynamical variables are given in eqs.(c.4 ) and ( c.5 ) .",
    "using the general relations @xmath97 and assuming the restrictions ( 4.2 ) and ( 4.4 ) , one obtains ^a_- a^b_+_ab & & = 2^_-a^_+ + ^_-a^_+ + & & = -2e^-_- y -_-a^_+ , + v^a_+ b^b_-_ab & & = 2 v^_+b^_- + v^_+b^_- + & & = 2e^-_+ x + _ + b^_- .next , with the help of the expression ( b.8 ) for @xmath98 we find b^a_-r_aba^b_+=&&-2e^- -b^_-a^_+",

    "the last , @xmath7independent term in will be canceled in the complete action @xmath78 , eq.([3.9-a ] ) .",
    "in this section we shall consider the functional integral of the theory defined by the action ( [ 3.9 ] ) , and show , by performing a suitable gauge fixing and integrating out some dynamical variables , that this theory leads to the induced gravity action .",
    "it is useful to introduce auxiliary fields @xmath100 , and rewrite the part of the action @xmath78 given by 4d_+x_1d_-y_1 e^-_1 -4d_+x_2d_-y_2 e^-_2 , in the form = & & f_1-d_+x_1 + f_1+d_-y_1 -f_1-f_1+e^_1 + & & -f_2-d_+x_2 -f_2+d_-y_2 + f_1-f_1+e^_2 , or , more explicitly , = & & -b^_-(f_1 + -f_2 + ) + a^_+(f_1 - -f_2- ) + & & + f_1-x_1 + f_1+y_1 -f_1-f_1+e^_1 + & & -f_2-x_2 -f_2+y_2 + f_2-f_2+e^_2 .",

    "consequently , we find = -f_-f_+(e^_1-e^_2 ) , and the reduced action becomes & & i^r ( , f_-,f_+)=d^2 .",
    "the complete action @xmath78 is invariant under the remaining piece of gauge transformations : & & f_- = -^ f_- , f_+ = ^ f_+ , + & & _ 1 = ^ -^ , _ 2 = ^-^ .",

    "note that the part of the functional integral depending on @xmath119 is decoupled from the rest , and can be absorbed into the normalization factor .",
    "thus , using gauge invariant variables effectively restricts the space of dynamical variables ; it is , essentially , equivalent to a gauge  fixing corresponding to @xmath120 transformations , e.g. @xmath121 , @xmath122 , followed by the integration @xmath123 .",
    "thus , the final form of the effective action for the gauged wznw system is given by ( 5.5 ) .      to show that the effective theory ( 5.5 ) is equivalent to the induced gravity ( 1.2 ) ,",

    "it is well known that an acceptable gauge extension of the simple wznw model does not exist unless one requires specific constraints on the gauge group @xcite .",
    "the reason for this unusual behaviour steams from the fact that gauged wz term @xmath48 does not represent , in general , a field theory on a 2d manifold @xmath3 . if one tries to select an action defined on @xmath3 , one looses gauge invariance , and vice versa . in string models",
