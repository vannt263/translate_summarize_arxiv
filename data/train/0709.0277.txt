    "the double beta decay is the rarest nuclear weak process .",
    "it takes place between two even - even isobars , when the decay to the intermediate nucleus is energetically forbidden or hindered by the large spin difference between the parent ground state and the available states in the intermediate nuclei .",
    "it comes in three forms : the two - neutrino decay @xmath8 is just a second order process mediated by the weak interaction .",
    "it conserves the lepton number and has been already observed in a few nuclei .",
    "the second mode , the neutrinoless decay @xmath9 , needs an extension of the standard model of the electroweak interactions as it violates lepton number . a third mode",
    ", @xmath10 is also possible in some extensions of the standard model and proceeds via emission of a light neutral boson , a majoron @xmath11 .",
    "the last two modes , not yet experimentally observed , require massive neutrinos an issue already settled by the recent measures by super - kamiokande  @xcite , sno  @xcite and kamland  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the double beta decay without emission of neutrinos would be the only way to sign the majorana character of the neutrino and to distinguish between the different scenarios for the neutrino mass differences . in what follows",
    "we shall concentrate mostly in the @xmath9 mode .",
    "the uprising of interest in the observation of the @xmath9 decay was somewhat obscured by the analysis of the status of the calculations of the nuclear matrix elements , that enter in the lifetime of the decay together with the effective neutrino mass , made in ref .",
    "the authors concluded on a very pessimistic note , saying that the spread of the available values for the nuclear matrix elements was such that there was no hope to translate the experimental signal into useful input for the theories beyond the standard model .",
    "a critical assessment of the results of the many calculations available in the framework of the quasi particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) has been made recently @xcite , with a much more optimistic conclusion . in this article",
    "we want to continue improving upon the reliability of the calculated nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) in the framework of large scale applications of the interacting shell model ( ism ) .",
    "in addition , we put forward a process of benchmarking the different approaches , and study the stability of the nme s under reasonable modifications of the nuclear structure inputs of the calculations .",
    "as we have already mentioned , some nuclei , otherwise nearly stable , decay emitting two electrons and two neutrinos ( 2@xmath12 ) by a second order process mediated by the weak interaction , that has been experimentally measured in several favorable cases .",
    "the decay probability contains a phase space factor and the square of a nuclear matrix element    @xmath13^{-1 } = g_{2\\nu } |m^{2\\nu}_{gt}|^2\\ ] ]    if the neutrinos are massive majorana particles , the double beta decay can take place without emission of neutrinos ( 0@xmath12 ) . in this case the transition is mediated by terms that go beyond the standard model .",
    "the decay probability contains a phase space factor @xcite , the effective electron neutrino mass ( a linear combination of the mass eigenvalues whose coefficients are elements of the mixing matrix ) and the nuclear matrix element @xcite .",
    "@xmath14^{-1}= \\nonumber \\\\",
    "g_{0\\nu}\\left(m_{gt}^{(0\\nu ) } - \\left(\\frac{g_v}{g_a}\\right)^{2 }     m_{f}^{(0\\nu)}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\langle m_{\\nu }     \\rangle}{m_{e}}\\right)^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the 2@xmath0 matrix element can be written as :    @xmath15    the nuclear structure information entering in this matrix element consists on the wave function of the ground state of the father nucleus ( f ) and the wave function of the state of the grand daughter , gd(j ) , nucleus ( j=0 , j=1 , or j=2 ) to which the decay proceeds .",
    "in addition , the wave functions and excitation energies of all the 1@xmath16 states in the odd - odd daughter nucleus are in principle necessary .",
    "the spin - isospin operators in the nuclear medium are quenched by a factor q@xmath171/g@xmath18 , and this quenching factor is also required to reproduce the experimental data of the 2@xmath0 double beta decays .    to compute exactly the 0@xmath0 matrix element , we would also need the wave function of the ground state of the father nucleus and of the ground state grand daughter , but in addition we would need all the wave functions and excitation energies of all the j@xmath19 states in the odd - odd daughter nucleus .",
    "most conveniently , the matrix elements can be approximately obtained in the closure approximation , that is good to better than 90% due to the high momentum of the virtual neutrino in the nucleus ( @xmath17100  mev ) hence , the matrix element can be written as :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the neutrino potential ( @xmath171/r ) . in this approximation",
    "no knowledge of the intermediate nucleus is directly implied .",
    "the transition operators are usually obtained from the hamiltonian of doi et al .",
    "@xcite however , according to recent claims @xcite , additional terms originating in the coupling to the virtual pions , should give non - negligible contributions .",
    "the finite size of the nucleon and the short range correlations need to be taken into account in the calculation of the two body matrix elements of the 0@xmath0 two - body transition operators as well .",
    "perhaps the most relevant issue for our mastering on the neutrinoless double beta decays is to get a better insight in the physical content of the two body transition operator . only with this knowledge",
    "could one decide whether the nuclear wave functions that enter into the calculation of the nme s contain the degrees of freedom that correspond to the correlations to which the operator couples dominantly .",
    "the two body decay operators can be written generically as :    @xmath22    in words , what the operator does is to annihilate two neutrons in the parent nucleus and to create two protons the nme is the overlap of the resulting object with the grand daughter ground state .",
    "the contributions to the 0@xmath0 matrix element as a function of the * j * of the of the decaying pair have a very telling structure as can be seen in figure [ fig : se82jj ] .",
    "the dominant contribution corresponds to the j=0@xmath16 pairs , while all the other pairs have much smaller contributions , but all of them of sign opposite to the leading term . if the initial and final wave functions had seniority zero , only the leading term would contribute and the matrix element would be maximal",
    "this is a first indication , relating the pairing content of the nuclear wave functions and the neutrinoless double beta decay operator .",
    "se @xmath23 @xmath3kr decay as a function of the j of the decaying pair [ fig : se82jj ] ]",
    "in the quest for better wave functions to describe the double beta decay processes , two main avenues have been explored . the interacting shell model in larger and larger valence spaces , with ever improving effective interactions , and the quasiparticle rpa .",
    "ideally , both methods should be able to produce good spectroscopy for parent , daughter and grand - daughter , even better if it extends to a full mass region , correct total gamow teller strengths and strength functions , 2@xmath0 matrix elements , etc . in brief , the goal is to have a description as close to perfect as possible of the dynamics of the nuclei involved in the transition . until rather recently ,",
    "ism calculations that could encompass most of the relevant degrees of freedom of the nuclei of interest , were only available for the lighter emitters , and , as a consequence , most systematic studies were performed in the qrpa framework . as we will discuss in the next section , all the potential double beta emitters are now within the reach of the ism except @xmath24nd , that , being deformed , is also out of the reach of the spherical qrpa calculations .    in the ism approach ,",
    "the valence spaces contain a number of orbits that is `` small '' compared to the qrpa , however , all the possible ways of distributing the valence particles among the valence orbits are taken into account . in the qrpa calculations , the number of active orbits is larger , but only 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations from the normal filling are considered ( and not all of them ) .",
    "the effective interactions used in the ism calculations are usually g - matrices whose monopole behavior is fitted to the spectroscopic properties of a large region of nuclei , in general those comprised between to magic closures for the neutrons and for the protons . in some cases",
    "the interactions are plainly fitted to a set of experimental masses and excitation energies . in the qrpa description ,",
    "the starting point is provided by realistic or schematic interactions , however , both the particle - particle and the particle - hole channels of the interaction are affected of strength parameters dubbed @xmath25 and @xmath26 that are fitted to selected experimental data . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the double beta decay matrix elements depend critically of @xmath26 .",
    "there are different opinions among the qrpa practitioners about the best choice of the value of @xmath26 .",
    "the two preferred options being to fit the experimental 2@xmath0 matrix elements , or to fit the gamow teller strength functions . in a sense , none is really safe , because the pure @xmath27 channel plays a rather minor role in the 0@xmath0 decay .",
    "the dominant correlations in the nuclei are due to the pairing and quadrupole - quadrupole terms of the nucleon nucleon interaction in the medium . in the ism",
    ", the pairing correlations are treated exactly within the valence space .",
    "proton and neutron numbers are exactly conserved .",
    "proton - proton , neutron - neutron , and proton - neutron ( iso - vector and iso - scalar ) pairing channels are included on equal footing .",
    "on the contrary , in the spherical qrpa only proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing terms are considered .",
    "they are treated in the bcs approximation .",
    "proton and neutron numbers are not exactly conserved . from the spherical shell model point of view , this approach is a seniority zero approximation at the bcs level . when the rpa correlations are taken into account , higher seniority components appear in the ground states of the father and grand daughter nuclei , however , for the rpa to be valid , their amplitudes must decrease rapidly with increasing seniority .",
    "the multipole correlations and the eventual intrinsic deformation can be properly described in the laboratory frame in the ism description .",
    "angular momentum conservation is exactly preserved . in the qrpa",
    "the multipole correlations of the ground state are treated at the rpa level .",
    "the posibility of having permanent intrinsic deformation is not contemplated yet .",
    "classical 0@xmath29 ism valence spaces are the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 shells .",
    "these correspond to the harmonic oscillator major shells of principal quantum number * p * equal to 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "we use the following notation ; in shell * p * , the orbit j = p+1/2 is denoted by the spectroscopic label of l = p and the remaining ones by r@xmath33 .",
    "the space r@xmath34 g is adequate for @xmath2ge , @xmath3se and their descendants . with the r@xmath35h space for the neutrons and the g - r@xmath35 for the protons , we aim to understand the decays of @xmath36zr , @xmath37mo,@xmath38pd , and @xmath39cd .",
    "finally the r@xmath35-h space is a natural choice for the description of the @xmath4sn , @xmath40te , and @xmath7xe decays .",
    "all these spaces are accessible to large scale ism descriptions",
    ". the strasbourg - madrid @xcite shell - model codes can deal with problems involving bases of o(10@xmath41 ) slater determinants , using relatively modest computational resources .",
    "in the valence spaces r@xmath34-@xmath42 ( @xmath2ge , @xmath3se ) and r@xmath35-@xmath43 ( @xmath4sn , @xmath40te , @xmath7xe ) we have obtained high quality effective interactions by carrying out multi - parametrical fits @xcite whose starting point is given by realistic g - matrices @xcite . with these interactions",
    "the beta decay properties of a large set of nuclei are well reproduced .",
    "the 2@xmath0 double beta decay half - lives are found in reasonably good agreement with the experimental results as well . in the valence space proposed for @xmath36zr , @xmath37mo , @xmath38pd and @xmath39cd ,",
    "our results are still preliminary and subject to further improvement both on the interaction side and on the removal of the yet necessary truncations .",
    "our results are obtained in the closure approximation , with the short range and finite size corrections modeled as described in @xcite ; using r@xmath44=1.2  fm to make the matrix element dimensionless ; with g@xmath18=1.25 ; and without higher order contributions to the nuclear current .",
    "a preliminary estimation of the higher order contributions gives a reduction of the ism nme s in the range of 10% .",
    "our present best values are collected in table [ tab : update ] .",

    "the occupancies that we obtain are relatively large ( 0.25 neutrons in each orbit ) and the effect is to increase the matrix element by 15% .",
    "it is interesting to note that the increase with the two orbits simultaneously active is equivalent to that obtained including one or another orbit separately .",
