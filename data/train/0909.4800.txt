    "proton and @xmath83 particle evaporation give large recoil energies to the residual nucleus , since they need high kinetic energy to penetrate the coulomb barrier .",
    "neutrons do not face the same situation , hence the average recoil energy given to the nucleus is smaller .",
    "* position of @xmath0-ray emission : in order not to have @xmath0-ray emission inside the target , the life times must be longer than the time it takes for the ions to pass the target material . to have a negligible influence on the doppler effects ,",

    "* energy and angular straggling of the ions in the target should be as small as possible . *",
    "gamma - ray energies : a minimum @xmath0-ray energy of 500 kev is required .",

    "is often observed , therefore even - even final nuclei are preferred .    in this",
    "work two reaction types were studied in order to find a suitable reaction : a ) proton capture @xmath157 or deuteron capture @xmath158 and b ) fusion evaporation with emission of one neutron followed by @xmath0 rays , for example @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",
    "both type of reactions were of inverse kinematics type , with a heavy ion beam on a proton or deuteron target .",
    "the code used to evaluate the cross sections was talys , a comprehensive nuclear reaction modeling code @xcite .",
    "the projectiles and ejectiles in talys can be of type @xmath0 rays , neutrons , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , with energies in the range 0.1 to 200 mev .",
    "the mass number of the target can be in the range @xmath9=12 to @xmath9=339 .",
    "note that by talys it is not possible to simulate the reactions in inverse kinematics .",
    "talys was , however , used for calculating the cross sections of the reactions , which are independent of the reaction being of normal or inverse kinematics type . in this work",
    "the results obtained with talys were in several cases compared to experimental data taken from the national nuclear data center .",
    "the total probability of a reaction to happen , i.e. the total cross section @xmath163 , is the sum of the elastic @xmath164 and the inelastic cross section @xmath165 :    @xmath166    the inelastic cross section is a sum of the compound nucleus , pre - equilibrium and direct cross sections .",
    "the compound nucleus formation cross section @xmath167 , is defined as the difference between the reaction @xmath168 and the direct cross section @xmath169 :    @xmath170    the output of talys contains the calculated cross sections for non - elastic direct reactions , non - elastic and elastic compound nucleus reactions , and non - elastic pre - equilibrium reactions .",
    "the target that will be used in the experiment has an effect on the velocity and direction of the ions .",
    "the program used for studies of the target effects was trim @xcite , which is a monte carlo based program that simulates collisions between incident ions and atoms in the target material .",
    "angular and energy distributions of the incident ions are obtained from the trim simulations .",
    "the target material can be chosen from a list of chemical substances and compounds .      when the ions enter the target material they are deflected due to the electromagnetic interaction primarily with the electrons .",
    "thus , the ions will loose energy and deviate from the beam direction , which leads to so called energy and angular straggling of the ions .",
    "there are two main aspects of the target effects in the simulations",
    "* position of the reaction in the target*. if the reaction occurs in the beginning of the target , the residual nucleus will experience energy and angular straggling , whereas if the reaction occurs at the end , the incident ion instead of the residual nucleus will lose kinetic energy .",
    "the difference both in kinetic energy and atomic number of the incident ion and residual nucleus leads to the difference in straggling .",
    "* neutron energy and angular distribution*. after the reaction the excited compound nucleus is formed , and particles are emitted .",
    "depending on the energy and angular distribution of the particles , the residual nucleus will obtain different kinetic energies .",
    "the recoil due to the neutron evaporation will either boost the nucleus or slow it down . since this happens inside the target material the energy and angular straggling will change after the reaction .",
    "two extreme cases were investigated , one where the neutron is emitted at about @xmath171 relative to the ion beam , and the other where it is emitted in at about @xmath172 .",
    "the fusion - evaporation simulations were done using the monte carlo code evapor @xcite .",
    "this program allows for fusion of two arbitrary nuclei , followed by evaporation of particles which can be of 7 different types @xmath173 as well as emission of @xmath0 rays .",
    "it uses the statistical model for compound nucleus reactions , described in section [ sub : compound - reactions ] .    in evapor the velocity of the emitted particle in the laboratory system , @xmath174 ,",
    "is obtained by adding the velocity of the compound nucleus in the laboratory system @xmath175 and the velocity of the particle in the center of mass system @xmath176 :    @xmath177    the transformation of the particle emission angle between the center of mass m and laboratory systems is given by + @xmath178 where @xmath179^{1/2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath180 denotes the q - value of the decay , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 are the masses of initial and final products , and @xmath60 the center of mass energy of the impinging particle .",
