    "this paper is the second in a series of papers that describe the results of a large program to determine galactic structure by measuring trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions .",
    "trigonometric parallaxes provide the `` gold standard '' of distance measurements and can resolve fundamental questions of source luminosity , mass , and age .    the targets of our program are methanol ( ch@xmath4oh ) masers associated with high - mass star forming regions .",
    "we used the national radio astronomy observatory s very long baseline array ( vlba ) to conduct astrometic observations of the masers relative to compact extragalactic radio sources , and we have achieved parallax accuracies approaching @xmath510  @xmath6as .",
    "background information about our program is given in @xcite , hereafter called paper i.    in this paper we report vlba observations of 12 ghz methanol masers toward ngc  7538  and cep  a. these well - studied sources are in the @xmath7 quadrant of the galaxy .",
    "ngc  7538  has a kinematic distance of about 5.6  kpc , which would place it well past the perseus spiral arm , possibly in the `` outer '' ( `` cygnus '' ) arm .",
    "however , @xcite found that the kinematic distance for w3oh , a source at a comparable galactic longitude and kinematic distance , was a factor of two too great .",
    "so , obtaining a direct distance estimate is important to locate this source in the galaxy . while cep  a is likely in the `` local '' arm or spur , its distance is uncertain , with estimates ranging between 0.3  kpc @xcite and 0.9  kpc @xcite . here",
    "we present parallax measurements of ngc  7538  and cep  a.",
    "paper i describes the general observational setup and method of calibration . here",
    "we give only procedures and parameters specific to the observations of ngc  7538  and cep  a. we used the vlba ( program br100c ) to observe the @xmath8 e ( @xmath9  mhz ) transition of methanol at five dates : 2005 september 9 and december 1 and 2006 february 25 , may 26 and september 1 .",
    "these dates were selected to symmetrically sample both the eastward and northward parallax signatures and minimize correlations among the parallax and proper motion parameters . the first , fourth and fifth observations were fully successful with a very low ( @xmath101% ) level of observing downtime ; for the second epoch the brewster antenna did not produce fringes and for the third epoch hancock did not observe due to bad weather .    in order to provide independent measures of parallax and reduce the risk of structural variability of the background source , we used two background continuum sources : j2254 + 6209 and j2302 + 6405 .",
    "table  [ obs_sou ] lists the positions of the masers and the background sources .",
    "the dual circularly polarized 4  mhz bands containing the maser signals were centered at lsr velocities ( @xmath11 ) of @xmath12  km  s@xmath3  and @xmath13  km  s@xmath3  for cep  a and ngc  7538 , respectively .",

    "the spectral channel with the strongest maser emission was used as the phase reference : @xmath15  km  s@xmath3  for cep  a and @xmath16  km  s@xmath3   for ngc  7538 .",
    "these reference features were detected at all epochs and were relatively stable , varying in intensity by less than @xmath17% .",
    "for the maser data , after phase referencing we produced naturally - weighted maps for each spectral channel , covering a region of @xmath18  2@xmath19 .",
    "our spectral resolution was inadequate to resolve some narrow maser features and , to minimize spectral sidelobes , we hanning smoothed the visibilities , reducing the velocity resolution to @xmath18  0.8  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "we searched all maser spectral channels for emission above a conservative threshold taken as the absolute value of the minimum in the map .",
    "this allows for dynamic range limitations , as opposed to using a strict map - noise limit .",
    "the detected maser spots were fitted with an elliptical gaussians brightness distribution ( using the aips task jmfit ) .",
    "the maser images for both sources were elongated and extended over a size of a few mas .",
    "this precluded using vlba antennas that produced only long baselines that fully resolved the masers , since reference - phase solutions could not be obtained .",
    "thus , compared to some other sources in our program , these observations had lower angular resolution .",
    "for both maser sources we used a circular restoring beam of 2  mas fwhm , which was close to the interferometer  dirty \" beam .",
    "the reference channel image for ngc  7538  revealed some asymmetric structure ( see fig .",
    "[ ngc_images_1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we self - calibrated ( amplitude and phase ) the reference channel visibilities and applied the corrections to both the continuum and line data before mapping .",
    "this preserves the astrometric precision for relative position measurements .",
    "the cep  a reference channel was not strong enough to allow self - calibration .",
    "the image ( see fig .  [ cep_images_1 ] ) shows symmetric low - level structures that are probably caused by small amplitude calibration errors . since , for brightnesses @xmath20% of the peak , the source structure is relatively simple , resonable position accuracy could still be achieved .    for the background continuum sources ( j2254 + 6209 and j2302 + 6405 ) , we integrated the data from all four dual - polarized bands and imaged the sources using the aips task imagr .",
    "the naturally - weighted `` dirty '' beam was determined by the availability of maser phase - reference data and was almost circular with a fwhm of @xmath21  mas . matching the maser images",
    ", we adopted a circular restoring beam of 2  mas ( fwhm ) .",
    "we measured the parallax and proper motions of the 12  ghz masers from the change in the position differences of the masers with respect to the background continuum sources .",
    "the change in position of a maser spot relative to the background source was modeled as a combination of the parallax sinuisoid and a secular proper motion in each celestial coordinate .",
    "see paper  i for details of this procedure .    since systematic errors , owing to maser blending , potential structure in the background continuum sources , and unmodeled",
    "atmospheric delay variations usually dominate over signal - to - noise limitations , we adopted an empirical approach to the weighting of the data .",
    "we added `` error floors '' in quadrature with the formal position uncertainties , separately to the east and north position offsets .",
    "these error floors were adjusted until the residuals of parallax and proper motion fit yielded a @xmath22 per degree of freedom near unity in each coordinate .      for ngc  7538 , we found that spatial blending of maser features limited the accuracy of spot positions .",
    "we attempted to fit multiple spatial components to blended images , but this yielded component positions with poor accuracies ( @xmath23  mas ) .",
    "instead we found that using the the centroid position of the maser reference channel , which by definition is zero after phase referencing , improved the parallax fits compared to multi - component fits .     and 0.12  jy  beam@xmath3 for the j2254 + 6209 and the j2302 + 6405 image , respectively .",
