    "for the case of several known gravitational lens systems , the deflector is either not yet detected or it is so faint that its redshift remains unknown ( see the gravitational lensing web page at ` http://vela.astro.ulg.ac.be/grav_lens/ ` ) .",
    "measurement of the deflector redshift is mandatory in order to properly model the corresponding gravitational lens systems .",
    "usually , the lens redshift is determined from spectroscopic observations of either emission lines due to the lensing galaxy or of galaxy absorption lines detected in the spectra of the qso images . in this work ,",
    "we present an alternate method to derive the redshift of a too faint and/or an invisible lens .",
    "first , we describe the method which is based upon the fitting of photometric observations with a redshifted extinction model and we then show results from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the latter turn out to be very useful in order to assess the errors affecting the estimate of the lens redshift .",
    "next , we attempt to apply this method to several known gravitational lens systems and outline all observational requirements needed in order to derive successful results .",
    "finally , we propose a generalization of this method .",
    "conclusions form the last section .",
    "figure [ schema ] depicts a gravitational lens system .",
    "the light rays emitted from the quasar are deflected by the lensing galaxy and the resulting macro images are reddened because of extinction effects in the deflector . due to the different path lengths across the galaxy , differential reddening results between the macro lensed components .",
    "the flux received by the observer from component @xmath0 at a wavelength @xmath1 is : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the flux that would be observed from the quasar in the absence of lensing , @xmath4 the macro lens amplification of component @xmath0 , ext(@xmath5 ) the galaxy dust opacity at the wavelength @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the lens redshift ) and @xmath8 ( see cardelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , and @xmath9 the path length of component @xmath0 through the deflector .    when deriving eq .",
    "( [ flux ] ) , we have of course implicitly assumed that the macro lensed images are not contaminated by light from the lensing galaxy , that they are not affected by microlensing effects , that no intrinsic colour variations exist between the lensed components , that the law of extinction ( first assumed to be alike that of the galaxy ) is similar all through the deflector and that the observed reddening takes place in a single lensing plane .",
    "a check on the applicability of most of these conditions can be made as suggested in section [ colour - colour_diagrams ] .",
    "the colour of component @xmath0 , between the wavelengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 , is then merely given by : @xmath12 having chosen one of the macro - lensed images as a reference component ( i.e. @xmath13 ) , the relative colour of component @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 ) may be expressed as : @xmath16 \\label{rel_colour}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 represents the relative path length of component @xmath14 .",
    "if we assume that the gravitational lens system consists of @xmath18 macro lensed components and that observations are being carried out through @xmath19 filters , we easily find that there are @xmath20 independent colours for each of the @xmath21 components ( the reference component is of course not included ) .",
    "thus , there results a set of @xmath22 equations alike eq .",
    "( [ rel_colour ] ) .",
    "besides , there are 2 unknowns which do not depend on the numbers of filters and components : @xmath7 and @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , for each of the @xmath21 components , there is one additional unknown : @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , we have a total of @xmath25 unknowns .",
    "since we must have more equations than unknowns , we easily establish the necessary condition : @xmath26 for @xmath18 = 2 , 3 , or 4 , we easily find out that @xmath27 4 , 3 or @xmath28 , i.e. a minimum of 4 , 3 or 3 filters is requested , respectively .    therefore , observational data of multiply imaged quasars acquired through several photometric filters are mandatory .    note that if data obtained in @xmath19 filters come from several different observing runs , it is then safer to only use those colours formed between filters from the same run and hence we finally get less than @xmath20 useful colours .",
    "the above necessary condition may consequently not be any longer fulfilled .      before applying the proposed method , we must make sure that in a colour - colour diagram , and in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ rel_colour ] ) , the measurements of the various lensed components are approximately located along a straight line . otherwise , it may mean that one or more of the conditions listed in section [ generalities ] are not fulfilled .",
    "secondly , the differential reddening for most of the components has to be significantly larger than the observational errors .",
    "otherwise , the slope of the straight line in the colour - colour diagram remains too uncertain .",
    "for example , the components of the gravitational lens systems ( kristian _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ) and ( yee & ellingson @xcite ; yee & bechtold @xcite ) have very similar colours and hence these cases are not appropriate for application of this method .",
    "promising candidates are ( see an example of colour - colour diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] ) and especially which is known to be very stable ( moore & hewitt @xcite ) and probably not affected by significant microlensing effects ( mcleod _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the left side of equation ( [ rel_colour ] ) , which corresponds to an experimental relative colour , is directly derived from photometric observations of the macro lensed quasar images .    the right side of equation ( [ rel_colour ] ) , and more explicitly the quantity  @xmath29 \" , is systematically computed for different contiguous values of @xmath23 and @xmath7 using the galaxy extinction law from cardelli _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the relative path lengths @xmath24 are fitted using a routine that minimizes the following @xmath30 :    @xmath31    figure [ carte_simul ] presents such a @xmath30 map obtained from a set of simulated data ( see below ) .",
    "in order to study the errors affecting the estimate of the lens redshift using the fitting method described above , we have carried out a wide range of monte carlo simulations .",
    "when doing these , we first fix the values of the following parameters : the lens redshift @xmath7 within a defined interval , the parameter @xmath23 usually set to 3.1 - corresponding to the average galactic value - , the relative macro - amplification @xmath32 and the relative path length @xmath24 through the deflector for each lensed component so that we can calculate precise relative magnitudes for as many different filters as we wish .",
    "then we add to these magnitudes a gaussian noise of a certain level and apply the above fitting method .",
    "we repeat these two last steps 100 times and calculate the dispersion @xmath33 in the estimate of the lens redshift and the @xmath23 parameter .    carrying out such simulations for different contiguous values of the theoretical lens redshift and for levels of noise comprised between 0.01 mag . and 0.05 mag .",
    ", we obtain the curves illustrated in fig .",
    "[ noise ] for which we used the set of the five u , b , v , r and i johnson filters .",
    "we see that the dispersion @xmath33 affecting the estimate of @xmath7 is about 0.1 and even less at higher redshifts . the visible  oscillations \" in fig .",
    "[ noise ] correspond to the positions of the wavelengths of the different selected filters with respect to the redshifted 2175  absorption bump ( see cardelli _",
    "@xcite ) . as an example ,",
    "[ plot_abs ] represents the extinction law of cardelli _ et al . _",
    "( @xcite ) as a function of the reciprocal wavelength @xmath34 for @xmath35 . the redshifted ( @xmath36 )",
    "positions of the u , b , v , r , i , j , h , k and l filters are indicated .",
    "furthermore , we have illustrated in fig .",
    "[ histos_rv ] dispersions affecting the derived values of @xmath23 for the cases of 5 filters and two different levels of noise : 0.01 mag . and 0.05 mag .",
    "we see that , in this latter case , the dispersion gets rather large .    next , fig .",
    "[ filters ] shows on a logarithmic scale differences in the lens redshift dispersion when using the u , b , v , r and i filters or the infrared i , j , h , k and l filters .",
    "since the method is sensitive to the extinction gradient between two filter wavelengths , the much higher dispersion derived for the infrared filters is mainly accounted for by the shallower shape of the extinction law in the infrared range .",
    "moreover , the lower extinction in the infrared range also affects the dispersion in the estimate of the lens redshift because the experimental relative colours are smaller and hence the effects of noise get more pronounced .",
    "finally , we have also used other extinction laws such those proposed by pei ( pei @xcite ) for the milky way ( `` mw '' ) , the large magellanic cloud ( `` lmc '' ) and the small magellanic cloud ( `` smc '' ) . from the same set of simulated data as in fig .",
    "[ carte_simul ] , fig .",
    "[ courbes_pei ] shows the resulting @xmath30 curves .",
    "comparable minima and lens redshift solutions are usually found for the mw and lmc laws .",
    "however , high quality photometric observations are mandatory in order to efficiently select the most likely lens redshift among acceptable solutions for the different extinction laws .",
    "note that because of the noise in the simulated photometric data , the minimum for the mw curve in fig .",
    "[ courbes_pei ] is found at @xmath37 , instead of the theoretical value @xmath38 .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    figure [ carte_2237 ] represents the @xmath30 map for the derived from the published sets of photometric observations listed in table [ phot_2237 ] .",
    "the minimum is found for @xmath39 . however , the redshift of this gravitational lens is known to be 0.04 ( huchra _ et al . _",
    "the small discrepancy between these two redshift values is very likely due to the fact that the data were obtained during two different runs when photometric quality was not good enough ( @xmath40 mag . for approximately half the reported values in table [ phot_2237 ] ) .",
    "moreover , this gravitational lens system is very likely affected by microlensing effects on a time scale of several years ( irwin _ et al .",

    "very high signal - to - noise photometric observations of the einstein cross , using several filters during a single run and reliable tools to derive the photometry of the multiple qso images , are badly needed to confirm that the different experimental relative colours reported between the lensed components are effectively , and solely , due to extinction effects in the deflector .

    "furthermore , the macro - lensed images must not be affected by light contamination from the lensing galaxy , by microlensing effects or by intrinsic colour variations reflected with a time dependence between the lensed components .",
    "unfortunately , all these conditions are rarely fulfilled at the same time and existing photometric data are often not good enough or not sufficiently reliable .",
    "consequently , accurate photometric observations of gravitational lenses obtained in several filters during the same run are badly needed .",
    "finally , we have seen that the redshifted extinction law of the lensing galaxy could be directly retrieved by means of a similar method provided that we may record the individual spectra of at least 3 lensed components , over a wide wavelength range , assuming that no light contamination , no microlensing effects ,  affect the individual lensed components .",
