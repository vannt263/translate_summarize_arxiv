    "strong electronic correlations are a big challenge in condensed matter theory . in the case of bulk materials ,",
    "dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite turned out to be a big breakthrough - at least in three dimensions .",
    "the reason for this is that local , time - dependent electronic correlations are taken into account accurately .",
    "this local part is the major contribution of electronic correlations at least for high enough coordination or dimensions or at elevated temperatures . for realistic materials calculations on the other hand ,",
    "dmft has been merged with density functional theory in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "@xcite all these calculations are done in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , for an infinitely extended crystal .    in nanoscopic systems",
    "the confinement of electrons into low - dimensional structures is expected to enhance correlation effects compared to bulk materials . since complex nanoscopic systems are nowadays experimentally available , a microscopic modeling of them together with a reliable solution method taking electronic correlations into account is highly desirable . in the context of transport through nanoscopic systems also",
    "the detailed modeling of the reservoirs is required to accurately describe the experimental data .",
    "very small nanoscopic systems and molecules consisting only of a few atoms can still be calculated exactly , i.e. the low energy effective hamiltonian for these can be solved , or for even simpler di- or tri - atomic molecules numerically exact solutions are possible e.g. by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite or configuration interaction . however , as soon as the nanoscopic or molecular systems become somewhat more complex this is not possible any longer and , hence , a reliable approximation is needed .",
    "recently , there have been efforts to apply dmft also to finite systems such as nanoscopic structures and molecules connected to reservoirs .",
    "@xcite since nanoscopic systems are very different from the bulk , at this early stage , we have first of all to learn how reliable dmft for describing electronic correlations in nanoscopic and molecular systems is",
    ".    a general scheme for treating correlated nanoscopic systems should also include non - local spatial correlations beyond dmft . in this respect cluster @xcite and diagrammatic extensions",
    "@xcite have been developed . among the diagrammatic extensions , the dynamical vertex approximation ( d@xmath0a ) @xcite represents a systematic improvement beyond dmft , as it allows to calculate the non - local part of the self - energy under the assumption of locality for the 2-particle fully irreducible vertex .",
    "recently it has been shown that the fully irreducible vertex is computationally accessible @xcite , e.g. via the numerical solution of an anderson impurity model ( aim ) .",
    "however a full calculation for nanostructures at the d@xmath0a approximation level , including the solution of the parquet equations @xcite , is indeed computationally expensive .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the dmft approximation level , that can be seen as a special case of a general scheme that we call `` nano - d@xmath0a '' , as described in ref . .",
    "in section [ sec : method ] , we outline the method and discuss the connection with related or alternative approaches . in section [ sec : benzene ] , in order to understand the reliability of dmft for nanoscopic systems , we compare it extensively to a numerically exact solution , in an interesting case of a quasi one - dimensional molecule ( benzene ring ) , and provide general criteria of validity for the approximation . in section [ sec : qpc ] we show the potentiality of the method applying it to single atom quantum junctions , namely to quantum point contact ( qpc ) of different sizes .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] provides a summary and outlook .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , we are interested in a nanoscopic system consisting of sites ( e.g.  atoms ) @xmath1 with an inter - site hybridization ( hopping ) @xmath2 , a local coulomb repulsion @xmath3 and ( optionally ) a coupling @xmath4 to some non - interacting environment , describing metallic leads contacted to the nanostructure .",
    "the hamiltonian hence reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) denote the creation ( annihilation ) operators for an electron with spin @xmath10 on site @xmath1 and in lead @xmath11 state @xmath12 with energy @xmath13 . for the purposes of the present paper",
    "the one - band hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is enough , because the main goal is to validate our approach .",
    "the extension to multi - orbital problems is straightforward and below we will highlight the corresponding modifications to the general scheme .",
    "let us just recall here , that a numerically exact solution of this problem suffers from a non - polynomial growth of the computational effort with the system size and is hence limited by severe restrictions on the number of sites .",
    "therefore , if one aims at dealing with complex structures made of more than a few coupled sites , some kind of approximation is needed .",
    "a dmft - like approach with a suitable approximation may be able to deal with a large number of coupled correlated sites , but in order to apply dmft -and its extensions- to nanoscopic systems one needs to define a proper local impurity problem , whose solution ( usually numerical ) represents the bottleneck of the algorithm .",
    "what one can do is to reduce the @xmath14-impurity anderson problem ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) onto a set of independent auxiliary aims , one for each of the @xmath15 inequivalent atoms in the nanostructure .",
    "each aim is a local problem that can be numerically solved to compute the @xmath16 correspondent ( local ) self - energies , the knowledge of which allows to build a dmft self - energy for the nanosctructure .",
    "the process is embedded into a self - consistency loop . this way the overall computational effort",
    "is heavily reduced , depending only linearly on @xmath17 , that in case of highly symmetric structures may be much lower than @xmath14 .",
    "this procedure has however the drawback that non - local correlations within the nanostructure , which are expected to be relevant in low dimensions , are neglected .",
    "the treatment -when necessary- requires a more sophisticated analysis beyond the dmft level .",
    "the starting point of the method is the green s function of the whole nanostructure ( including the leads ) @xmath18 , which is a matrix in the site space , @xmath19 being a ( complex ) variable indicating the ( matsubara ) frequency .",
    "the generic matrix element of its inverse reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the self - energy matrix describing the interaction between the impurity electrons . in the multi - orbital case the matrices @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "would also depend on orbital indices .",
    "all information about the geometry of the nanoscopic system is included in the hopping and in the hybridization matrices . at the model level it is therefore straightforward to implement even extremely complex nanostructures .",
    "the input may come as well from an _ ab - intio _ calculation , e.g. a local density approximation ( lda ) projected to wannier orbitals , @xcite allowing for realistic calculations of nanoscopic systems and a quantitative comparison with experiments .",
    "the general flowchart of the method is shown in fig.[fig : flowchart ] and is described below in more detail :        \\(i ) the first step consists of the definition of a local problem for each of the inequivalent atoms of the nanostructure , by means of the relation @xmath26}^{-1 } + \\sigma_{ii}(z).\\ ] ] the dynamic weiss field @xmath27 , @xmath28 , is built inverting the @xmath1-th block of @xmath25 and it contains the information of the environment of site @xmath1 , i.e. the rest of the nanostructure . in the multi - orbital case eq .",
    "( [ eq : weissfield ] ) becomes obviously a matrix equation with orbital indices .",
    "( ii ) the numerical solution of each aim yields a local ( dmft ) self - energy @xmath29 .",
    "all the @xmath17 inequivalent self - energies are then collected and assigned to the corresponding equivalent sites as well , in order to build a self - energy matrix which is diagonal in the site index @xmath30 the self - energy @xmath21 is then plugged into eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) in order to compute the green s function of the whole nanostructure and the process is iterated self - consistently till convergence .",
    "the approximation involved in the present scheme is already known in the literature , and similar schemes have been applied to different kind of systems .",
    "an approach for quasi one - dimensional systems is the chain - dmft by biermann _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite where a system of weakly coupled ( equivalent ) chains is replaced by a single effective chain , coupled to a self - consistent bath .",
    "more in general , the idea is suitable to the study of inhomogeneous systems , and has been applied to , e.g. , the study of bulk materials in the presence of two - dimensional interfaces by potthoff and nolting @xcite , as well as to the case of lda+dmft calculations with locally - inequivalent atoms within the unit cell ( see e.g. ) .",
    "another noticeable case is its application to ultracold atoms on optical lattices , using the so - called real - space dmft ( r - dmft ) , by snoek _",
    "_ , @xcite where the inhomogeneity comes from the external , spatially dependent , trapping potential , applied to an otherwise translationally invariant lattice .",
    "the present approach is similar to the r - dmft , the difference being that in our case each site is also coupled to a non - interacting bath , and a possible inhomogeneity arises not due to an external potential , but from the geometry or even the chemical composition of the nanostructure itself .",
    "the application of dmft to nanoscopic systems , on the other hand , has been already attempted following alternative ways .",
    "a nano - dmft scheme has been already proposed by florens @xcite , relying however on a specific cayley - tree geometry .",
    "realistic calculations of strongly correlated transition metal nanoscopic devices and of correlated ad - atoms on surfaces have been also recently carried out by jacob _",
    "_ @xcite and by surer _",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "in the following we will apply the presented dmft method to various nanoscopic systems , in order to test the reliability of the approximation and to explore its potentialities .    in this spirit",
    ", we extend the results presented in our previous work @xcite computing several physical quantities , such as the occupations , local and non - local self energies , in the case of a benzene ring , where we can compare dmft to a numerically exact solution .",
    "this allows us to show that our method is highly reliable in a wide range of parameters , but also to shed light on the physical role of the ( missing ) non - local correlations , which are responsible for the breakdown of the approximation .",
    "thereafter , the most natural step is to show the suitability of the method for more complex nanosystems .",
    "we focus our attention on quantum junctions , in which electronic correlations are expected to be of importance due to both the confinement of electrons and the lack of a proper metallic screening at the atomic size contact .",
    "even though in the literature many theoretical attempts to investigate transport at the mesoscopic scale can be found , the electron - electron interaction is usually either completely neglected or taken into account within possibly too simple approximation schemes .",
    "@xcite    all the results presented below , both for dmft and for the exact solution , were obtained using hirsch - fye qmc @xcite as an impurity solver for the aim , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the use of a hirsch - fye algorithm limits us to high temperatures ( about room temperature in the calculations presented here ) but on the other hand it allows a quantitative comparison between the dmft results and exact solution .",
    "a rather standard system in which the problem of understanding quantum transport phenomena is addressed is a benzene molecule , contacted with metallic ( e.g. au or pt ) electrodes .",
    "therefore we study a nanostructure made of six correlated sites in the geometry of a benzene - like one - dimensional ring , given by hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath31 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we consider here specifically a single orbital which may not be a bad approximation for the benzene @xmath32 orbital .",
    "@xcite our primary intention however , is to systematically test our approximation for a simple model rather than a realistic calculation .",
    "each site @xmath1 has a hybridization channel @xmath33 to a metallic lead ( labeled @xmath11 ) . in a typical experiment two sites of the benzene molecule",
    "might be contacted by metallic wires . however , for the sake of simplicity , and to deal with a system where all sites are fully equivalent , we consider each site to be contacted in an equivalent way to its own lead , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "the latter is not the only possibility to achieve the equivalence of all sites , but it represents a suitable configuration where one can study quantum electronic transport through a correlated nanostructure .",
    "a scheme of the nanostructure considered here is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_benzene ] .    , connected between them via nearest neighbor ( @xmath35 ) and longer range ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) tunneling channels , and to metallic leads via hybridization channels ( @xmath38 ) . ]    in the calculations two topologies of the hopping parameters",
    "are considered : ( i ) nearest neighbor hopping @xmath35 only ( nn  t ) and , for studying the effect of a higher connectivity ( number of neighbors ) ( ii ) equivalent hopping amplitude to all sites , i.e. , nearest , next - nearest and next - next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath39 ( all  t ) .",
    "of course the latter is a rather unrealistic configuration since the hopping amplitude in a real molecule will decrease with distance , but it provides interesting insight into the validity of the approximation without introducing too many different hopping parameters .     as a function of @xmath40 , comparing dmft ( lines ) with the exact qmc solution ( symbols ) for both hopping to two nearest neighbors only ( nn  t ) and to all neighbors ( all  t ) configurations , at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , taken from ref . .",

    "[ fig : a0 ] we show non - interacting density of states @xmath49 for the isolated molecule ( @xmath50 ) . in the nn  t case ,",
    "the benzene ring is half - filled and insulating , the spectral function is symmetric with respect to the fermi level and the gap given by the bonding and anti - bonding combination of the kinetic term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the all  t case is also insulating but is not particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the results for @xmath51 as a function of the ratio between the hybridization strength @xmath38 and the absolute value of the hopping amplitude @xmath35 are shown in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] . looking at the nn  t topology",
    ", we observe that the agreement between the exact solution and dmft is very good when the hybridization @xmath38 is large .",
    "in the limit @xmath52 , each atom forms a bound state with its own lead , hence the inter - site ( non - local ) correlations become essentially negligible and dmft works well .",
    "the opposite molecular limit @xmath53 is clearly the most difficult for dmft .",
    "indeed , the spectrum @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] differs from the exact solution , which is gapped , while dmft shows a small finite spectral weight .",
    "one expects that , upon increasing the connectivity , the dmft description improves . in order to check this",
    ", we consider the all  t topology as well .",
    "indeed we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] that as the number of neighbors per atom is increased , no substantial difference to the exact solution can be found even in the intermediate region @xmath54 where deviations from the exact solution in the nn  t case are already visible .",
    "note that below @xmath55 , the exact qmc solution is not available any longer due to the fermionic sign - problem , therefore we can not check the molecular limit for the all  t topology at this value of @xmath56 with such an impurity solver .",
    "the hamiltonian of the isolated molecule can nevertheless still be diagonalized exactly also in the interacting case .",
    "the diagonalization predicts an insulating state also for the all  t configuration , meaning that the approximation , even in the high connectivity case , will break down at low enough hybridization .",
    "similar agreement between dmft and the exact solution is found for the site occupation , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : besetzung ] . in the nn  t topology ,",
    "the effect of the interaction and of the hybridization on the spectrum is to redistribute the spectral weight , with respect to the non - interacting case , in such a way that the system stays half - filled .",
    "however when the band structure is changed , and other hopping channels beyond the nn one are included , the density becomes @xmath35 , @xmath56 , and @xmath38 dependent and the system may move away from half - filling . on the other side , concerning the double occupancy shown in the main panel , we can see that , for high connectivity and high values of @xmath40 , corrections beyond dmft are not important , while approaching the molecular limit the system is more spatially correlated than what dmft suggests , overestimating double occupations .            a very clear explanation of the overall agreement shown above , between dmft and the exact solution , is provided by the comparison of the respective self - energies for both hopping topologies , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : siw_nnt ] and [ fig : siw_allt ] . as usual",
    "let us begin discussing the nn  t case first , referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : siw_nnt ] , where we plot the corresponding self - energy in matsubara representation . in panel",
    "( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) the imaginary part of the local self - energy for different values of @xmath40 is shown ( the real part is zero due to the half - filling condition ) .",
    "one can see that the nano approximation nicely captures the local physics , accurately reproducing the exact self - energy at low frequencies and thus providing a reliable estimate for the quasi - particle residue @xmath57 moreover the amplitude of the local self - energy slightly decreases as @xmath38 is increased , the system becoming less correlated and the agreement even improving .",
    "however the slope of the local self - energy at @xmath58 in some cases is clearly not enough to capture the full picture , and we have to take the non - local self - energy into account .",
    "this becomes evident analysing the molecular limit @xmath50 .",
    "in this limit and at finite @xmath56 , the exact solution evidently predicts an insulating solution , as one can see from the absence of spectral weight at the fermi level in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] .",
    "the gap is controlled by @xmath56 and is due to large non - local contributions of the self - energy , as shown in panels ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : siw_nnt ] . at the same time , in the non - interacting limit @xmath59 , the isolated , half - filled , benzene molecule is a trivial band insulator . in this case , the hamiltonian is made only of the kinetic term and the gap @xmath60 is given by the energy difference between the bonding and anti - bonding eigenstates , @xmath61 .",
    "one can show , on the basis of simple arguments , that , in presence of non - local correlations , a suppression of the spectral weight at the chemical potential can be achieved by a large @xmath62 even in the case of a linearly vanishing @xmath63 as in panel ( a ) @xcite .",
    "another interesting point concerning the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : siw_nnt ] is that , upon increasing @xmath38 , deviations from the exact results due to non - local correlations are quickly suppressed , while the local ones remain sizable . approaching the limit @xmath64 of course also local correlations are gradually suppressed .",
    "these results can be summarized as follows : when the molecule is weakly connected to the contacts , one needs to go beyond dmft , i.e. taking non - local correlations into account , in order to provide a good description of the system . on the other hand , in the region of intermediate hybridization coupling the most important role",
    "is played by the local physics , in a situation where the molecule is still strongly correlated . in many actual cases",
    "this is the interesting region from the experimental point of view .",
    "this suggests that our method provides an accurate tool for describing the physics of correlated nanostructures , already at the dmft approximation level .",
    "when non - local spatial correlations become non - negligible , one needs instead to go beyond dmft .",
    "in addition to this , encouraging results come also from the analysis of the self - energy in the all  t configuration , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : siw_allt ] . in panels ( a ) and ( b )",
    "respectively , we show the comparison for the imaginary and the real part of the local self - energy at @xmath65 , i.e. very close to the lowest value of @xmath40 accessible to the qmc exact solution .",
    "the agreement between the curves is substantially perfect as expected on the basis of the previous analysis .",
    "moreover in this case , where the connectivity is higher with respect to the nn  t hopping topology , any non - local contribution to the self - energy is already negligible with respect to the local ones , namely , almost two order of magnitude smaller ( not shown ) .",
    "this means that the region where only the local physics is important extends to lower values of the hybridization when the connectivity is higher . below this threshold , as discussed before , we can study the evolution of the self - energy toward the molecular limit only with dmft .",
    "the results , in panel ( c ) and ( d ) , show that the system is becoming more correlated upon decreasing @xmath38 , i.e. the imaginary part of the local self - energy is increasing , and most likely also non - local correlations arise . concerning the real part of the self - energy , it displays the formation of a peak - structure at low energy , while the large - frequency tail , determining the filling , tends toward zero as the system gets close to half - filling ( compare also with the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : besetzung ] ) .     with @xmath40 , at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , for both nn  t and all  t hopping configurations , according to the labels in the plots .",
    "]    in order to have a better picture of the behavior of the system , not limited to the fermi level , we present in fig . [",
    "fig : bz_spectra ] the evolution with @xmath40 , for both nn  t and all  t hopping configuration , of the spectral function @xmath66 , obtained via analytic continuation on the real axis of the dmft(qmc ) data using a maximum entropy method .",
    "@xcite already in the case of the isolated molecule , i.e. @xmath50 , the spectral function of the interacting system shows substantial differences from the non - interacting one shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] . in the nn  t topology",
    "@xmath66 retains two low energy peaks , symmetric with respect of the fermi energy , corresponding to the bonding and anti - bonding peaks of the non - interacting spectrum , and some of the spectral weight is shifted to higher energies , forming a lower and an upper hubbard band .",
    "only some spectral weight fills the band gap , which is consistent with the previous finding of @xmath51 ( main panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0 ] ) , and with a linearly vanishing dmft self - energy at @xmath67 ( panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : siw_nnt ] ) , the redistribution of the spectral weight due to the interaction is instead more drastic in the all  t topology .",
    "the five - fold degenerate peak of the non - interacting spectrum disappears , as its degeneracy is lifted , and the resulting spectrum is metallic .",
    "this difference becomes even more important when the system is coupled to the leads .",
    "the hybridization to the metallic leads , on one hand provides an additional broadening of the many - body states , via the so - called lead self - energy ( or hybridization function ) , while on the other it favors the emergence of a kondo - like resonance at the fermi energy in the single particle spectral function of each of the benzene sites .",
    "therefore , in the all  t topology one can observe the formation of a narrow resonant peak at the fermi energy in the spectral function , while in absence of electronic correlation the structure exhibits a fairly large gap at the fermi level in both hopping configurations , and no resonant peak would exist . upon increasing @xmath38",
    "the resonance exhibits a maximum and is then suppressed . in the limit @xmath68 ,",
    "the hybridization becomes the dominating energy scale , the spectral weight is shifted to the hubbard bands , and the spectral functions , in both hopping configurations , loose almost all low - energy features becoming similar to each other .    a very interesting issue deals with the study of electronic transport in correlated nanostructures .",

    "the system is made of two identical structures of correlated atoms with a simple body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice symmetry , narrowed in a double - cone - like junction .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume a single band model which may be suitable for cuprate or cobaltate junctions , though orbital selective tunneling processes will probably also play a role in , e.g. gold or aluminum devices .",
    "hopping processes are allowed to nearest neighbor sites , both intra - layer and inter - layer , with amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively , while the hopping between the tips is defined by the parameter @xmath100 .",

    "[ fig : toyqj ] .    in the previous letter",
    "@xcite we addressed the problem of what is happening at the junction in the mcb process , and we simulated the breaking of the junction by changing the distance @xmath101 between the two structures thought the control parameter @xmath100 , i.e. the overlap of the electrons atomic - like wave functions of the tip - atoms . according to ref . , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the angular momentum quantum numbers associated to the orbitals involved in the tunneling process . in the following",
    "we calculate the distance @xmath105 according to the above formula , where we suppose @xmath106 , i.e. a @xmath107-like orbital character for the correlated atoms bands , however the general physical argument discussed in the following does not depend on the precise dependence of @xmath101 on @xmath108 .",

    "is increased dmft reveals strong deviations from an exponential behavior of @xmath84 , expected in the case of a tunneling process through a barrier .",
    "such a result is associated to a local mott - hubbard crossover , occurring at the tip - atom(s ) .",
    "it can be explained considering that the mcb process effectively removes a neighbor from the already poorly connected tip - atoms .",
    "this further reduces the metallic screening of the local coulomb interaction expected in the bulk , causing the tip to become more insulating - like .",
    "if correlations can so strongly influence the electronic structure of the contacts , this phenomenon could have a huge impact on the interpretation of experimental results , and it is therefore worth being investigated extensively .    the fundamental question to answer is whether the crossover is a generic characteristic of quantum junctions . following ref . , we performed calculations of the 5-layer qpc ( shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : toyqj ] ) but for a slightly different set of parameters , more realistic for the bcc geometry considered here , where the intra- and inter - layer hopping amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the same , and we choose @xmath112  ev . the results for such a structure are shown in fig .",

    "we find that a completely different behavior characterizes the tip - atoms instead . in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : qpc ] we restrict ourselves , for convenience , to the comparison of local quantities of just two representative atoms in the qpc , namely the tip - atom and one of the atoms sitting in the layer directly connected to the tip ( denoted as layer - atom in the following ) . below @xmath120",
    "ev , both @xmath116 and @xmath51 are continuously and monotonically suppressed as @xmath115 decreases , confirming that the tip - atoms undergoes a local mott crossover .",
    "one may further notice that the tips @xmath51 reaches a maximum around @xmath120  ev and decreases again for values of @xmath115 above this threshold .",
    "this phenomenon is not correlation - driven , as the double occupations always increase with increasing @xmath115 , but is caused by the recombination of the tip - atoms states into a bonding and anti - bonding structure .    in order to better understand the physics behind this phenomenon",
    ", we significantly reduce the complexity of the problem .",
    "we consider a junction made of two layers ( shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : toyqj ] ) so that the tip - atom is not connected directly to a bath of free electrons , but to a layer of correlated atoms",
    ". therefore , there are by symmetry only two inequivalent atoms left , tip- and layer - atoms .",
    "this makes the system much simpler , but still allows us to observe a dichotomy between the two kinds of correlated atoms .",
    "nevertheless it is important to stress that even this minimal model for the quantum junction can not be solved exactly with qmc due to a severe fermionic sign problem .    from the evolution of the conductance through the junction for different values of @xmath56 ,",
    "it is clear that some critical value @xmath122 exists , above which @xmath84 exhibits the more - than - exponential behavior associated with the mott - hubbard crossover , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2lj ] .",
    "the non - interacting qpc shows no peculiar feature , it evolves smoothly from the contact ( small @xmath101 ) to the tunneling ( large @xmath101 ) regime . as the value of @xmath56",
    "is increased the conductance is globally suppressed , and above some threshold it develops a much faster transition between the contact and tunneling regimes . in all cases @xmath84 does not reach the limit @xmath123 in the contact regime because of the absence of a completely open transmission channel .",
    "similar observation on mcb junctions @xcite or on the tunneling spectra of co impurities adsorbed on a cu(100 ) surface @xcite support the hypothesis that such effects , which we show to be driven by correlations , can be of importance in experiments . in order to relate the behavior of @xmath84 with a mott - hubbard transition",
    ", we also look at the layer - resolved @xmath51 , in analogy to the five - layer qpc .",
    "one has anyway to be careful here , because below a critical @xmath56 , the spectral weight is affected by strong , @xmath100-dependent , density fluctuations . on the other hand , approaching @xmath122",
    "all atoms occupations tend towards half - filling ( see fig . [",
    "fig : q2lj ] lower panels ) and the analysis of the spectral weight for this porpoise is safe .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2lj2 ] we show the results for the low - energy spectrum @xmath51 and the double occupations @xmath116 at a value of @xmath56 above the critical one ( @xmath124 ) , analogously to the case of the five - layer qpc .",
    "we can observe that below the threshold value @xmath125  ev both @xmath116 and @xmath51 for the tip - atoms decrease continuously with @xmath115 as the tip - atom becomes more insulating - like .",
    "the overall behavior for the tip - atom of the different size qpcs is qualitatively very similar , suggesting the existence of a ( size - independent ) energy scale associated with this phenomenon .",
    "one can notice that in the two - layer qpc the layer - atoms local quantities show some dependence on @xmath115 , and the values of the double occupations and of the low - energy spectrum of the layer - atoms are slightly reduced compared to the corresponding one of the five - layer qpc .",
    "this indicates correlation effects to be further enhanced upon decreasing the system size .",
    "one can indeed check that , considering junctions of intermediate size with respect to the ones shown here , i.e. adding one layer after the other to the two - layer qpc , helps the stabilization of both the local quantities of the layer - atoms , which loose almost any dependence on @xmath115 , while the tip - atoms still display a local mott - hubbard transition .",
    "another clear evidence of the enhancement of electronic correlations in the mcb process is also provided by the evolution with @xmath115 of the dmft self - energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : q2ljsiw ] we show the imaginary and real part of the local self - energy for both inequivalent atoms of the two - layer qpc at @xmath126 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the mcb process confines the tip - atom(s ) at the edge of the structure , and drastically suppressing the hopping channel in one direction further reduces the screening of the coulomb repulsion . consequently , electronic correlations in the tip - atom are strongly enhanced determining a local mott - hubbard crossover in the tip , while the layer - atom self - energy does not show significant dependence on @xmath115 . below the critical @xmath56 instead , one finds a dependence on @xmath115 only in @xmath127 , i.e. , in the renormalization of the chemical potential , responsible for the change in the occupancy ( not shown ) .",
    "the above analysis shows once more that the change in the conductance in the mcb process can be traced back to the strong electronic correlations arising from the spatial confinement of electrons in sharp contact devices .",
    "we have studied electronic correlations in nanoscopic systems within a many - body approach suitable to deal with complex correlated structures .",
    "we show that including local electronic correlations we can reasonably describe nanoscopic systems with many neighbors , long range hopping , or a sufficiently strong hybridization to non - interacting leads .",
    "these conditions are fulfilled in many cases of interest , but there are regimes in which non - local self - energies are observed and it becomes necessary to also include spatial correlations beyond dmft .",
    "we therefore plan to generalize the present method within the framework of d@xmath0a , in order to include spatial correlations at all lenght scales .",
    "this way we expect to be able to recover a reliable description of the nanoscopic system on an even larger parameter range .",
    "the present approach can be viewed as the @xmath128 particle level of a more general nanoscopic d@xmath0a scheme .",
    "it could be an important tool for investigating electronic transport in correlated structures at the nanoscale . in this respect we also studied , as a potential application , the transport through a mcb junction .",
    "going beyond ref . , we investigated the phenomenon of a local mott - hubbard crossover in quantum junctions of different sizes , showing that it is a general feature of sharp nanostructures and that it may be of importance for the interpretation of experiments .",
