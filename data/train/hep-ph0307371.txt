    "the violation of the cp symmetry is now established in the b meson sector and the parameter @xmath3 is measured with precision by babar  @xcite and belle  @xcite . however , the measurement of the other angles of the unitarity triangle are necessary for a more comprehensive study of cp violation .",
    "these measurements suffer from several difficulties related to the uncertainties of the theory , the limited statistics and/or ambibuities in their extraction .",
    "we have recently proposed a new method  @xcite involving three - body b meson decays , which circumvent these problems and allows to determine the angle @xmath4 .    in this paper",
    "we extend this method to the weak phase @xmath5 , which can be identified to the combination @xmath6 of the unitarity triangle angles  @xcite .",
    "important constraints on the theory will be obtained from the measurement of this phase . in the following ,",
    "we describe a new _ time dependent _ method involving the entire area of the dalitz plot of the 3-body decays @xmath7 . +",
    "the method involves no reconstruction into @xmath8 eigenstates and avoids problems with interfering dcsd .",
    "[ sec : method - infinite - stat ] we investigate a way to circumvent the color suppression penalty by using @xmath1 decay modes which potentially offers significantly large branching fractions and cp asymmetries .",
    "the particular decays considered here are of the type .",
    "these three body decays may be obtained by popping a @xmath10 pair in color allowed decays .",
    "although modes where one or more of the three final state particles is a vector can also be used , for clarity and simplicity only the mode @xmath7  is discussed here .    to    the diagrams leading to the final states of interest are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] . as can be seen , the diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams]a and  [ fig : diagrams]c ) are both color - allowed and of order @xmath11 in the wolfenstein parameterization  @xcite , where @xmath12 is the cabibbo mixing angle .",
    "the general formalism describing how the weak angle is extracted from observation of the time - dependent cp violation has been first presented in @xcite . however , in the present analysis additional information is used to resolve the inherent ambiguities related to the method .    selecting a particular point @xmath13 in the dalitz plot ,",

    "[ fig : diagrams]a and b on the one hand and  [ fig : diagrams]c and d on the other hand as @xmath14 and their cp conjugates @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the relative phase of the ckm matrix elements involved in this decay , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) are the real amplitudes and cp - conserving strong interaction phases",

    "we have used the approximation @xmath28 .",
    "+ the pdf of the transition @xmath29 is @xmath30 from the total number of events in each of the four final states ( [ eq : btodm ] ) and ( [ eq : btodp ] ) and a global fit of their time dependence , it is possible to extract the quantities , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "one obtains : @xmath34 hence , in the limit of very high statistics , one would extract @xmath35 for each point @xmath13 of the dalitz plot .",
    "however , for every point of the dalitz plot , @xmath36 is obtained with an eight - fold ambiguity in the range @xmath37 $ ] , because of the invariance of the @xmath38 terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : btodm ] ) and ( [ eq : btodp ] ) under the three symmetry operations @xmath39 when the multiple measurements made in different points of the dalitz plot are combined , some of the ambiguity will be resolved , in the likely case that the strong phase @xmath40 varies from one region of the dalitz plot to the other .",
    "this variation can either be due to the presence of resonances or because of a varying phase in the non - resonant contribution . in this case",
    ", the exchange symmetry @xmath41 is numerically different from one point to the other , which in effect breaks this symmetry and resolves the ambiguity .",
    "similarly , the @xmath42 symmetry is broken if there exists some _ a - priori _ knowledge of the dependence of @xmath40 on the dalitz plot parameters .",
    "this knowledge is provided by the existence of broad resonances , whose breit - wigner phase variation is known and may be assumed to dominate the phase variation over the width of the resonance . to illustrate this , let @xmath13 and @xmath43 be two points in the dalitz plot , corresponding to different values of invariant mass of a particular resonance .",
    "one then measures @xmath44 at point @xmath13 and @xmath45 at point @xmath43 , where @xmath46 is known from the parameters of the resonance .",
    "it is important to note that the sign of @xmath46 is also known , hence it does not change under @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , should one choose the @xmath42-related solution @xmath47 at point @xmath13 , one would get @xmath48 at point @xmath43 .",
    "since this is different from @xmath45 the @xmath42 ambiguity is resolved .",
    "this is illustrated graphically in eq .",

    "since experimental data sets will be finite , extracting @xmath16 will require making use of a limited set of parameters to describe the variation of amplitudes and strong phases over the dalitz plot",
    ". the consistency of this approach can be verified by comparing the results obtained from fits in a few different regions of the dalitz plot , and the systematic error due to the choice of the parameterization of the data may be obtained by using different parameterizations .",
    "a fairly general parameterization assumes the existence of @xmath53 breit - wigner resonances , as well as a non - resonant contribution : @xmath54 where @xmath55 represents the dalitz plot variables , @xmath56 is the breit - wigner amplitude for a particle of spin @xmath57 , normalized such that @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) are the magnitude and cp - conserving phase of the non - resonant @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) amplitude , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) are the magnitudes and cp - conserving phase of the @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) amplitude associated with resonance @xmath43 . the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 may be assumed to vary slowly over the dalitz plot , allowing their description in terms of a small number of parameters .",

    "what follows , we discuss important properties of the method by considering the illustrative case , in which the @xmath63 decay proceeds only via a non - resonant amplitude , and the @xmath64 decay has a non - resonant contribution and a single resonant amplitude .",
    "for concreteness , the resonance is taken to be the @xmath78 .",

    "all the parameters of table  [ tab : reference ] were determined by the fit , and the arrow in these figures indicates the point corresponding to the parameters of table  [ tab : reference ] .",
    "one observes that @xmath84 does not depend strongly on the value @xmath36 . as expected , a strong dependence on @xmath87 is seen .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xmath88 changes very little for all values of @xmath89 above 0.4 .",
    "this suggests that the potential for a significantly sensitive measurement is high over a broad range of parameters .",
    "we have shown how @xmath36 may be measured in the color - allowed decays , focusing on the simplest mode @xmath7 .",
    "the absence of color suppression in the @xmath63 amplitudes is expected to result in relatively large rates and significant cp violation effects , and hence favorable experimental sensitivities .",
    "while the dalitz plot analysis implies some experimental complication , it should reduce the eight - fold ambiguities , which are a serious problem with other methods for measuring @xmath36 . as a result of these advantages ,",
