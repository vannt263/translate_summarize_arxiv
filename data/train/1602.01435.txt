    "the standard model of cosmology ( @xmath7cdm ) is quite successful in accounting for many observations , in part due to its rather large number of free parameters .",
    "these include the spatial curvature constant @xmath8 , the hubble constant @xmath9 and the scaled matter ( @xmath10 ) , radiation ( @xmath11 ) , and dark - energy ( @xmath12 ) densities . in terms of the critical density @xmath13",
    ", one writes @xmath14 , where @xmath15 represents the energy density @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or dark energy @xmath18 , as the case may be . without invoking priors",
    ", one must typically optimize at least five unspecified parameters , all of which can be adjusted to fit the data .",
    "given this wide latitude of possible outcomes for the expansion history of the universe , it is therefore very surprising to see that the optimization of model parameters , especially using anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , reveals a universal expansion with an average acceleration of zero ( within the measurement errors ) over a hubble time @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "another way to characterize this empirical result , in terms of the total pressure @xmath20 and energy density @xmath21 , is to note that averaged over a hubble time , the quantity @xmath22 has the value @xmath23 just at this moment , when we happen to be looking . yet the combination of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "could have produced a wide assortment of epochs with deceleration and acceleration .",
    "this outcome is not merely surprising @xcite . in the context of @xmath7cdm ,",
    "the condition @xmath24 can be achieved only once in the entire ( presumably infinite ) history of the universe , making it astonishingly unlikely .",
    "there is clearly physics behind this zero active mass condition . in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we showed that the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric is in fact valid only for a cosmic fluid with an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 , so the condition @xmath25 is independent of time . in other words ,",
    "no matter how imperfect or incomplete our parametrization of the standard model happens to be , the optimized parameter values must always yield a zero average acceleration , regardless of when we make the measurements .",
    "kim et al .",
    "@xcite have challenged this conclusion by providing what they believe to be a counter argument to the zero active mass condition in frw . in this paper , however , we demonstrate that their claim is based on the conventional mistake of writing the metric from the perspetive of an observer who is _ simultaneously _ in a non - inertial comoving frame , where a time dilation is unavoidable for an accelerated expansion of the spatial coordinates , and in a different , free - falling frame , with no measurable acceleration , thereby  assigning \" without justification a constant value of one to the lapse function @xmath4 .",
    "with the adoption of the cosmological principle , the spacetime metric may be simplified to the frw form @xmath26\\;,\\ ] ] in terms of the cosmic time @xmath27 , the comoving radius @xmath28 , the universal expansion factor @xmath29 , and the angular coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the comoving frame .",
    "the spatial curvature constant @xmath8 takes on the values @xmath32 , for an open , flat , or closed universe , respectively .",
    "two rarely discussed issues with this metric are ( 1 ) that its lapse function @xmath4 is constant , and ( 2 ) that in deriving its coefficients , one never considers whether the selected components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath33 are consistent with the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "in general relativity ( gr ) , a constant lapse function arises only in a free - falling frame , where the observer is not subject to any gravitational influences .",
    "so even before we discuss the formal relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath33 , proponents of the use of equation  ( 1 ) to describe the spacetime of an accelerating universe need to explain why this basic tenet of relativity theory should be violated , i.e. , why in the case of frw an observer in the free - falling frame nonetheless sees a gravitational acceleration without a corresponding time dilation .",
    "the general class of spherically - symmetric spacetime metrics , of which frw is a special case , may be represented as @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are each functions of @xmath28 and @xmath27 , and are to be determined by solving einstein s equations .",
    "it is somewhat tedious , though straightforward , to derive the dependence of @xmath39 on @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the conventional approach , however , @xmath36 is set equal to @xmath44 to arrive at equation  ( 1 ) without following this procedure .",
    "as such , the frw form of the metric does not produce any time dilation relative to the proper time in a local inertial frame , even in cases where the observer sees an accelerated expansion of the spatial coordinates , i.e. , when @xmath45 .",
    "this is critical because , as we shall see shortly , the hubble flow in frw is not inertial when @xmath45 .",
    "but as shown in ref .",
    "[ 8 ] , @xmath4 is in fact not equal to one when @xmath5 , a requirement of @xmath45 . borrowing a result from that paper , we find that @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the hubble constant .",
    "this expression provides the necessary , formal relationship between the lapse function @xmath4 and the active mass @xmath49 as seen by an observer in the comoving frame .",
    "clearly , @xmath36 changes for different values of the active mass and corresponding expansion history encoded into the integral for @xmath50 over cosmic time . in order to achieve a constant @xmath36",
    ", we must have @xmath51 , which is guaranteed only when @xmath52 .",
    "then one can show that @xmath53 is also constant , and we may set @xmath6 with an appropriate choice of the initial condition @xmath54 .",
    "this is where kim , lasenby and hobson @xcite interject with a counter claim that one is free to _ choose _ @xmath55 , in spite of its evident dependence on @xmath49 .",
    "they do so without explaining why they view equation  ( 3 ) as allowing @xmath36 to have different values for the same @xmath49 , and without providing a physical justification for making their particular choice leading to @xmath6 . in this regard , their approach is no different from the conventional procedure of simply forcing @xmath6 in equation  ( 1 ) before the metric is introduced into einstein s equations , thereby removing any possibility of a time dilation .",
    "the answer , of course , is that for the same @xmath49 , different values of @xmath36 correspond to different coordinate systems . and in order to force @xmath55 , while keeping @xmath56 , they must consider the observer to be _ simultaneously _ in the comoving frame where an active mass @xmath5 produces acceleration ( according to the second friedmann equation , in which @xmath57 ) and @xmath58 , and in the free - falling frame where @xmath6 by choice . if the introduction of the spherically - symmetric form of the metric ( equation  2 ) into einstein s equations were to reduce to the frw spacetime shown in equation  ( 1 ) irrespective of how one chooses the active mass , then this should happen automatically and unambiguously , _ without _ the manual intervention by kim et al .",
    "@xcite to force @xmath55 in equation  ( 3 ) .",
    "as we shall see below , this automatic reduction to equation  ( 1 ) does not happen because the comoving frame is not inertial , except in the special case when @xmath3 .",
    "this is also the reason why a gauge transformation can not be used to eliminate the coordinate - dependent @xmath4 after the fact .",
    "often misunderstood and incorrectly used , a gauge transformation in gr is a transformation of the coordinates selected in order to alter the metric coefficients @xmath59 to a desired form .",
    "since @xmath36 is solely a function of @xmath27 , it is straightforward to find the necessary transformation for frw but , as discussed in ref .  [ 8 ] , such a transformation would require the existence of two distinct frames of reference : one ( the comoving ) frame in which the observer sees @xmath45 when @xmath5 , and therefore @xmath60 , and a second ( free - falling ) frame in which the observer sees no time dilation and no acceleration . in other words , an observer can not carry out an actual gauge transformation and stay within the same frame . and",
    "since the comoving frame in frw is generally not inertial , an observer who experiences gravitational effects that lead to a coordinate - dependent lapse function can not simultaneously also be in a free - falling frame where he does not measure a time dilation .",
    "ultimately , the issue we have been discussing here , and in refs .  [ 8,9 ] , has to do with whether or not one can always clearly distinguish between accelerated and inertial frames .",
    "the answer is yes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ 10 ] ,   3.2 ) . in general relativity , acceleration can always be measured absolutely , unlike velocity , which is only measurable in a relative sense . for this reason",
    ", we can always find a local diffeomorphism that reduces the chosen manifold s metric to a minkowski metric in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a given spacetime point when tidal forces are ignored @xcite .",
    "the frw metric is not asymptotically flat and has a non - vanishing spacetime curvature tensor @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in spite of the fact that its weyl tensor is zero , which allows equation  ( 1 ) to be written as a conformally - flat metric , the comoving frame used to write the frw metric is not in free fall .",
    "one seldom sees this property of frw invoked in the interpretation of measurements made by a hubble observer ( however , see , refs .",
    "[ 13,14,15 ] ) , but one can easily demonstrate that the hubble flow in frw is in fact not inertial when @xmath5 .",
    "the metric coefficients @xmath62 and affine connections @xmath63 at @xmath64 contain enough information for us to determine the local inertial coordinates @xmath65 in the neighborhood of @xmath66 .",
    "as shown , e.g. , in ref .  [ 10 ] or [ 13,14 ] , the local inertial coordinates @xmath65 satisfy the equation @xmath67 in their most general form , the non - vanishing affine connections in frw are @xmath68 introducing these into equation  ( 5 ) , we see that the inertial coordinates @xmath69 must satisfy the following expressions : @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74    let us first consider the local inertial frame for an frw cosmology with zero active mass ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) , corresponding to @xmath75 ( normalized such that @xmath76 today ) .",
    "we will place the observer near the origin of his coordinates , so that @xmath77 . for this equation of state",
    ", we also have @xmath55 ( see equation  3 ) . the solution to equations  ( 6 - 10 ) is @xmath78 and @xmath79 ^ 2\\right)\\;,\\ ] ] correct to second order in @xmath80 .",
    "thus , according to these expressions , the local inertial frame in the vicinity of @xmath81 coincides with the hubble flow and , in this situation , one has @xmath82 with @xmath6 .",
    "thus , for this case ( _ and this case only _ ) , it is legitimate to consider the comoving and free - falling frames to be identical , and for the observer to see no acceleration and no time dilation , so that @xmath55 .    when @xmath5 , however , @xmath29 is no longer linear in @xmath27 , and @xmath83 in equation  ( 11 ) no longer satisfies equations  ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , regardless of whether or not one uses @xmath55 .",
    "for example , in order for @xmath84 to be consistent with equation  ( 9 ) , we would need either @xmath82 ( if @xmath55 ) , or @xmath85 ( if @xmath58 ) , both of which occur only when @xcite @xmath3 .",
    "of course , one can still find a local inertial frame when @xmath5 , but it is not coincident with the hubble flow @xcite . in this instance",
    ", the solution may be written as a polynomial to second order in @xmath28 , as demonstrated in   3.2 of ref .",
    "[ 10 ] , or [ 13,14 ] , but we do nt need to reproduce its coefficients here . the fact that the hubble flow in frw is not an inertial frame when @xmath5 is sufficient to prove our argument . therefore ,",
    "setting @xmath55 when @xmath5 in the comoving frame is not consistent with the fact that a time dilation should be measurable as a result of the acceleration seen by the observer .",
    "the confusion about the measurability of a time dilation due to acceleration in frw may be due to the fact that , because of homogeneity , @xmath4 can only be a function of @xmath27 , not @xmath28 , unlike the situation in the schwarzschild spacetime , where it is a function of @xmath28 and not of @xmath27 .",
    "but this difference in coordinates does not change the requirement that an acceleration must always produce a time dilation that is measurable relative to the passage of proper time in an inertial frame .",
    "therefore , regardless of whether @xmath4 is a function of @xmath27 or @xmath28 , the time dilation resulting from an accelerated expansion of the spatial coordinates can not be  hidden \" from the observer .",
    "putting @xmath6 in equation  ( 1 ) , even when @xmath45 , suggests otherwise , and is therefore inconsistent with basic relativity theory . to guarantee that @xmath55 in equation  ( 3 ) , one must have @xmath3",
    ".    concerned by `` gauge ambiguities '' in their first attempt at challenging the zero active mass condition , kim et al .",
    "@xcite extended their argument by attempting to derive the frw solution using a tetrad , which they claim constitutes a superior method that avoids such gauge ambiguities .",
    "they apparently believe that the physics of a problem may be changed merely by altering the calculational technique .",
    "but this is clearly false ; if a gauge amibuity is present with one approach , it is present for all approaches because , as we have emphasized all along , a gauge transformation is not arbitrary  it constitutes a transformation of coordinates from one frame to another .",
    "kim et al .",
    "believe that the sophistication of the tetrad approach somehow selects a unique frame of reference , creating their sought - after merger of a non - inertial comoving frame with a free - falling frame .",
    "this thinking , however , is flawed .",
    "the tetrad and its inverse simply package the metric coefficients and , once a solution is found , they must be unpacked to restore the spacetime coordinates .",
    "one therefore gets out what one puts in . in this",
    "regard , their approach is similar to that of tupper @xcite , who explicitly set @xmath6 in his use of the tetrad field equations to derive a generalized friedmann equation .",
    "kim et al.s use of the tetrad is more subtle , but they too invoked a special choice of coordinates  specifically , a particular choice of time  in order to simplify their tetrad ansatz _ before _ using the field equations to derive a solution .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on kim et al.s attempt to discredit the role of @xmath86 as a true gravitational horizon . in so doing",
    ", they follow the lead of van oirschot et al .",
    "@xcite and lewis et al .",
    "@xcite , who failed to realize that a horizon is observer dependent .",
    "an observer `` sees '' a horizon only in terms of null geodesics that actually reach him .",
    "thus , to correctly interpret the role played by the surface at @xmath86 , one must actually solve the null geodesic equations , as demonstrated by bikwa et al .",
    "@xcite and melia @xcite , not simply rely on how or when @xmath86 changes with time .",
    "a complete formal discussion of how @xmath86 delimits the portion of the universe visible to us today is given in melia @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the counter argument raised by kim , lasenby and hobson @xcite is simply based on the conventional approach of forcing the lapse function of the metric to be constant , without providing a physical justification for this particular  choice , \" even when the formal relationship between @xmath87 and @xmath33 permits a range of possibilities for the same active mass @xmath49 . in reality ,",
    "a specific selection of @xmath36 corresponds to a particular choice of coordinates . in frw ,",
    "the hubble flow is non - inertial when @xmath5 , so the comoving frame can not be identical to the free - falling frame .",
    "therefore one can not measure an acceleration without a corresponding time dilation .",
