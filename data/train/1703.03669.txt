    "in science and common practice , we compare entities in pairs , often without realizing it . for this reason ,",
    "pairwise comparisons might have been one of the first scientific methods .",
    "the first application of pairwise comparisons to elections has been recently attributed to the works of ramon llull , the 12-th century mathematician , logician , philosopher , majorcan writer , and mystic @xcite . however , it is easy to envision the practical use of pairwise comparisons taking place in the stone age .",
    "stones must have been compared to each other in pairs to decide which is better suited to use as a tool .",
    "when we have no unit ( e.g. , for reliability ) , we may consider the construction of a pairwise comparisons matrix ( pc matrix ) to express our assessments based on relative comparisons of attributes ( such as safety or reliability ) .",
    "after all , common sense and an old adage ( commonly attributed to creighton abrams ) calls for `` take one bite at a time '' when it comes to eating an elephant .",
    "our elephant is the processing of subjective data , especially for the decision making where the `` satisfying '' approach is often used .",
    "herbert a. simon , the nobel prize winner , proposed bounded rationality ( `` satisfying '' ) as a vital alternative to the exclusiveness of using mathematical theory for decision making .",
    "pairwise comparisons supports the concept of bounded rationality .    in this study",
    ", we consider special cases of pairwise comparisons matrices ( abbreviated to pc matrix here ) , which are @xmath3 reciprocal matrices @xmath4 with positive entries .",
    "pc matrix @xmath5 is called _ reciprocal _ if @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "obviously , @xmath8 for any @xmath9 , and thus the trace is @xmath10 however , blind wine testing may result not only in the lack of reciprocity but even to the lack of @xmath0s on the main diagonal since comparing the same wine to itself ( especially at the end of the tasting day ) , may not necessarily be correct .",
    "due to the internet , different assessors may compare projects or at least their components in different locations . in such situations , it is even anticipated that some ( if not most ) assessments may not be reciprocal .",
    "a pairwise comparisons matrix @xmath5 is called _ consistent _ ( or _ transitive _ ) if @xmath11 we refer to this as the consistency condition . while every consistent matrix is reciprocal , the converse is false in general .",
    "if the consistency condition does not hold , the matrix is inconsistent ( or intransitive ) .",
    "given a reciprocal @xmath3 matrix @xmath5 which is not consistent , the theory attempts to provide a consistent @xmath3 matrix @xmath12 which differs from @xmath5 `` as little as possible '' .",
    "the challenge of the pairwise comparisons method comes from the lack of consistency of pairwise comparisons matrices which arise in practice .",
    "the quotients @xmath13 express a relative preference of an entity @xmath14 over @xmath15 .",
    "an entity could be any object , attribute of it or a stimulus .",
    "consistent matrices correspond to the ideal situation in which there are exact values @xmath16 for the stimuli , since @xmath13 form a consistent matrix for all ( even random ) positives values @xmath17 .",
    "it is an important observation since the implication of it is that , a problem of approximation is really a  problem of selecting a norm and a distance minimization .",
    "notice that the vector @xmath18 is unique up to a multiplicative constant . for the euclidean norm ,",
    "the vector of geometric means ( which is equal to the principal eigenvector for a consistent pc matrix ) is the one which generates it .",
    "the seminal study @xcite had a profound impact on the pairwise comparisons research .",
    "it has strongly endorsed the use of the eigenvector , corresponding to the principal eigenvalue , for approximation of a  given inconsistent but reciprocal pc matrix .",
    "numerous studies show the lack of evidence for the superiority of the eigenvector solution . it is expressed in the highly cited @xcite and a sizable collaboration ( recently published ) @xcite .    in layman s terms , when we have three entities",
    ": @xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath21 , then @xmath22 must yield the same result as the comparison @xmath23 .",
    "however , more often than not , relation   does not hold when these three comparisons are carried independently . when the comparisons ( e.g. , important , safer , etc . ) or entities ( safety , reliability , etc . ) are subjective , the inconsistency is unavoidable in practice .",
    "in fact , the lack of inconsistency in such cases may be suspicious but it does not mean that inconsistency is desirable or should be tolerated .",
    "the `` gigo rule '' ( gigo stands `` garbage - in , garbage - out '' ) in the field of computer science and information technology refers to the fact that output quality depends on the quality of input data .",
    "at least three studies : @xcite defined and examined inconsistency in pairwise comparisons between 1939 and 1961 .",
    "the importance of inconsistency in pairwise comparisons is undeniable since it is still studied .",
    "pairwise comparisons are used in the decision making process for choosing from two alternatives ( yes / no , left / right , increase / decrease ... ) .",

    "the method used in the previous subsection can be extended to a family @xmath139 of circulant reciprocal matrices with @xmath140 terms @xmath1 and equal number of @xmath2 in each row . here",
    "@xmath141 , because at least one @xmath0 ( diagonal element ) is obvious in each row .    as it was for @xmath124 ,",
    "the family @xmath139 has important invariants : the perron root which is equal to the row sum , the corresponding eigenvector @xmath59 , and the consistency index . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the unique row sum @xmath143 is necessarily a perron root ( see the above cited theorem from @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath42 of each matrix in @xmath139 is : @xmath144 for a fixed @xmath1 , a larger @xmath140 increases @xmath42 .",
    "the maximal inconsistency @xmath145 is reached for @xmath146 hence @xmath25 needs to be odd since @xmath140 is integer .",
    "we remind that this value of @xmath42 was obtained in section  [ sec : lpcodd ] for @xmath147 .",

    "thus has @xmath150 the greatest possible value @xmath151 for a fixed @xmath1 and @xmath152 , this value approaches the maximal inconsistency @xmath145 .",

    "thus are their frobenius norms equal : @xmath158 recall from that the frobenius norm is @xmath159 .",
    "thus , one could expect the same eigenvalues for @xmath155 and @xmath147 .",
    "however , unlike the circulant matrices , a different position of @xmath1 and @xmath2 influences the perron root in @xmath155 matrix and thus affects the consistency index of the matrix .",

    "however , for @xmath99 its rounded limit will be equal to @xmath169 , hence will be ahp acceptable .",
    "moreover , when we consider small @xmath25 , we can obtain the same result even for bigger @xmath1 .",
