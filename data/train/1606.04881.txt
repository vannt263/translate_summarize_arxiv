    "not surprisingly , simulations played an important role in the analysis of the gw150914 and gw151226 events .",
    "specifically , best fits of a waveform to the data were included in the detection paper  @xcite .",
    "the papers on parameter estimation  @xcite and tests of general relativity  @xcite mentioned that results from simulations were involved in the construction of the phenomenological and effective - one - body waveform models used in the analysis .",
    "the same applies to the paper on the burst - type analysis of gw150914  @xcite .    as with gw150914 and gw151226 , our ability to distinguish in future observations whether a signal originated from a , a , or a binary will rely on waveform templates with input from this would be particularly important during the last orbits and coalescence of the binary , where strong dynamical gravity is the most relevant . in this regard , simulations of binary systems with companions have experience a boost in accuracy and sophistication .",
    "these days the simulations routinely include realistic equations of state , magnetic fields , and radiation .",
    "but the predicting power of simulations not only hinges on the multi - physics included . the degree to which the initial data represent an accurate astrophysical setting is also crucial .",
    "another important aspect connected to the initial data is the capability to explore a vast range of scenarios . and",
    "for this to happen , one needs initial data methodologies that are flexible and computationally inexpensive . in simulations , low - cost and efficient methods to construct",

    "a popular method to construct initial data representing a binary system in a quasi - circular orbit is the conformal thin sandwich approach .",
    "the method has been used for by  @xcite , for by  @xcite , and for binaries by  @xcite .",
    "the key in those studies was the identification of a helical killing vector field , so the initial data are approximately time - symmetric , ensuring that the compact objects are in a quasi - circular orbit .",
    "the conformal thin sandwich approach requires solving a set of five elliptic equations for the conformal factor , lapse function and shift vector  @xcite .",
    "many groups have used the code from the meudon group  @xcite for this purpose , and other groups have developed their own infrastructure  @xcite .",
    "this paper introduces a new approach to construct initial data for binary systems with components .",
    "the method is simpler than the thin sandwich one , and it has a computational cost and flexibility similar to that of the puncture method . in the puncture approach  @xcite , one only solves the hamiltonian constraint for the conformal factor .",
    "the solution to the momentum constraint is given by the bowen - york extrinsic curvature  @xcite .",
    "each initial data set is then fully specified by the masses , spins and momenta of the , and their separation .",
    "all of these parameters are obtained from integrating the equations of motion .",
    "the integration starts at large separations and ends at the separation where the initial data are constructed .",
    "this method is known to yield initial data suitable for stitching together and evolutions .",
    "the new initial data proposal in this paper recycles most of the elements of the puncture initial data .",
