    "our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early epochs of the universe has been vastly improved in the past a few years , thanks mainly to new deep surveys in a wide range of wavebands , ranging from the hst s wfpc2 ( uv and optical ) and nicmos ( nir ) surveys in the northern and southern hubble deep fields ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; williams et al . 1998 ; thompson et al .",
    "1999 ) to the scuba submm surveys ( see blain et al .",
    "1999b for a review ) . in particular , several mid - infrared ( mir ) and far - infrared ( fir ) deep surveys ( see elbaz et al . 1998b , puget & lagache 1998 for reviews )",
    "were conducted using the infrared space observatory ( iso ) ( kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) during its 29 months mission ( nov .",
    "1995  april .",
    "the new results from these surveys ( aussel et al . 1999 ; puget et al . 1999 ; dole et al .",
    "1999 ) indicate significant improvements in sensitivity and accuracy over the earlier published results ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ; kawara et al .",
    "strong cosmic evolution in the population of infrared - emitting galaxies is indicated in these results ( rowan - robinson et al .",

    "1998 ; aussel et al .",
    "1999 ; puget et al .",
    "1999 ) , consistent with the results of scuba surveys ( blain et al . 1999a ) and with the scenario hinted at by the newly discovered cosmic ir background ( cib ) ( puget et al . 1996",
    "; hauser et al . 1998 ; dwek et al . 1998 ; fixsen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these results challenge those from the uv / optical surveys ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ; pozzetti et al . 1998 ) in the sense that substantially more ( i.e. a factor of 3  5 ) star formation in the earlier universe with @xmath2 may be hinted at in the ir / submm counts and in the cib ( see , e.g. rowan - robinson et al .",
    "1997 ) compared to that derived from the uv / optical surveys ( madau et al .",
    "1998 ; pozzetti et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is attributed to dust extinction which may hide much of the star formation in the early universe from the uv / optical surveys ( see lonsdale 2000 for a review ) .",
    "the best observed band in these iso surveys is the isocam lw3 ( @xmath3 m ) band , with 14 surveys covering a wide range of flux density from 0.05 mjy to 50 mjy ( elbaz et al .",
    "compared to the longer wavelength isophot surveys ( e.g. 175@xmath0 firback survey , puget et al .",
    "1999 ) , isocam lw3 surveys have the advantage of using large detector arrays ( @xmath4 compared to the @xmath5 array of the isophot - c200 camera ) and having much better angular resolution which allowed the surveys to go very deep ( @xmath6 mjy compared to sensitivity limits of @xmath7 surveys of @xmath8 mjy ) before reaching the confusion limit .",
    "in addition to the indication of the significant cosmic evolution of ir galaxies , two other very interesting results are emerging from these mir surveys :    1 .   the euclidean normalized differential number counts of the 15@xmath0 band have a sharp peak at about 0.4 mjy ( elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ) which , elbaz et al .",
    "( 1998a ) claim , can only be explained by adding to the number count model a new population of objects which emerge ( with increasing z ) rapidly after @xmath9 and start to dominate the counts below 1 mjy , but contribute negligibly in brighter flux range ( fig.10 of elbaz et al .",
    "subject to the substantial uncertainties in their ir seds , the integrated light of the galaxies detected in 15@xmath0 surveys may account for most the ir / submm background ( elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ) .    taken at face values these results may have far - reaching impact on the studies of galaxy evolution , suggesting that the objects most responsible for the cib , which are mostly missed by the uv / optical surveys , are already identified in the 15@xmath0 surveys and , perhaps more interestingly , they are from a new population not seen in the local universe ( i.e. not among the iras sources which in general have @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , scrutiny of these interpretations of the 15@xmath0 counts is imperative because of the following two complications : ( 1 ) the effects of prominent emission features in the wavelength range of 3  13@xmath0 ( puget and leger 1989 ) which can cause very significant k - corrections in mir surveys ( xu et al .",
    "1998 ) ; and ( 2 ) the lack of a local luminosity function ( llf ) in the 15@xmath0 band which is needed for the quantitative determination of the evolution rate from the number counts ( to date , the iras 12@xmath0 luminosity functions have been mostly used in the interpretation of the isocam 15@xmath0 counts , resulting in large uncertainties due to the significant variations of the @xmath11 among galaxies ; see elbaz et al .",

    "the redshift distribution of the sources shows strong clustering ( ashby et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "will these affect the bivariate 15@xmath25 luminosity function ?",
    "the answer to this question depends on whether the 15@xmath0-to-@xmath26 color ratio is a sensitive function of the luminosity .",
    "this is because all the above potential problems with the sample are related to the redshift , and result in uncertainties in the luminosity distribution ( the visibility function ) but not in the @xmath22 ratio distribution . if the color ratio is insensitive to the luminosity , the conditional probability function @xmath27 ( cf .",
    "eq(7 ) of xu et al .",
    "1998 ) , which converts the 60@xmath0 llf to the 15@xmath0 llf , will be rather constant and wo nt be affected significantly by uncertainties associated with the luminosity .",
    "indeed , as plotted in fig.2 , the @xmath22 ratio of sources in the nepr sample appears to be rather insensitive to the luminosity .",
    "this result is similar to that of soifer and neugebauer ( 1991 ) who found that the @xmath28 ratio does not depend on the infrared luminosity . this may not be surprising given that the mechanisms of the 15@xmath0 emission and of the 25@xmath0 emission are nearly the same , namely due dominantly to the emission of small grains undergoing temperature fluctuations in normal galaxies such as the milky way , and to the warm dust emission associated with star formation regions in starburst galaxies such as m82 ( dsert et al .",
    "this dualism in the radiation mechanism of the mir continuum , at the wavelengths not contaminated by the mir emission features , is the major reason for the lack of dependence of the two color ratios ( @xmath22 and @xmath28 ) on luminosity . at the same time",
    ", the very cold @xmath28 ratios of ultraluminouse galaxies ( ulirgs ) , which are due mostly to extinction at @xmath29 ( xu and de zotti 1989 ) , also further weaken any statistical dependence of the @xmath28 ratio on the grain temperature , the latter is a strong function of the luminosity as demonstrated by the @xmath30 v.s . luminosity relation ( soifer and neugebauer 1991 ) .",

    "the very good agreement between the points of the two 15@xmath0 llfs near the knee ( fig.3 ) demonstrates that both normalizations are indeed reliable , eliminating a large uncertainty in the prediction of the local 15@xmath0 counts ( elbaz et al .",

    "note that at the bright end ( @xmath40jy ) the normalized counts of these sources are significantly higher than the counts in the fainter flux density bins .",
    "this excess of counts is very likely due to the overdensity associated with the local supercluster ( lonsdale et al .",
    "1990 ; saunders et al .",
    "1991 ) .      as pointed out by elbaz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the euclidean normalized isocam 15@xmath0 counts have a narrow and prominent peak at about 0.4 mjy .",
    "there have been suggestions that this peak indicates a new population of infrared sources emerging after redshift @xmath9 ( elbaz et al .",
    "1998a ) . on the other hand xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that such a feature can be caused by the broad - band emission features often associated to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules ( pah features , see puget and leger 1989 ) .",

    "( 1998 ) , specified by two galaxy evolution models including one pure luminosity evolution model with evolution rate as @xmath41 and one pure density evolution with @xmath42 , calculated using the number count model which takes into account the effects of these emission features , underestimated the counts when compared with the isocam data ( elbaz et al .",
    "this suggests that the evolution endured by the isocam sources is stronger than that assumed by xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which is based on previous studies of iras counts ( lonsdale et al . 1990 ; saunders et al .",

    "we present new model predictions using the same number count model of xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but with stronger evolution rates , and compare them with the isocam 15@xmath0 data .",

    "the results from the @xmath43 , @xmath46 cosmology are very close to the results presented in fig.4 , while the results from the @xmath45 , @xmath46 model fit the data slightly less well .",
    "the solid line represents the pure luminosity evolution model with l@xmath47 and with a turnover at @xmath48 beyond which the evolution turns flat ( i.e. l = constant for @xmath49 ) .",
    "the short - dashed line gives the counts predicted by another pure luminosity evolution model with l@xmath50 and with a turnover at smaller redshift : z=1 ( i.e. l = constant for @xmath51 ) .",
    "finally the long - dashed line is the prediction for counts by a pure luminosity evolution model without any turnover , and with an evolution rate of l@xmath52 . among the three luminosity evolution models ,",
    "the one with turnover at z=1.5 ( the solid curve ) gives the best fit , closely reproducing the overall shape and the level of the observed counts .",
    "the model with a turnover redshift z=1 predicts a peak which is too flat compared to the data .",
    "this is because , in the framework of the xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) model , the broadband mir features in the wavelength range 6  8.5@xmath0 , which are redshifted into the isocam lw3 bandpass when z=1@xmath53 , are largely responsible for the narrow peak of the counts in fig.4 .",
    "when the turnover occurs at z=1 , a significant number of sources in the redshift range of z=1  1.2 are dropped compared to the models without turnover or with the turnover at 1.5 , resulting in a less prominent peak .",
    "the model without turnover ( the long - dashed line ) predicts a peak at f@xmath54 mjy instead of 0.4 mjy as shown by the data .",
    "the dotted line shows the prediction by a density evolution model with comoving density @xmath55 until z=1.5 , turning flat afterwards ( i.e. @xmath56=constant when @xmath57 ) .",
    "this model gives a reasonable fit to data points brighter than f@xmath54 mjy .",
    "however in the fainter flux levels , instead of turning down , the model prediction keeps rising in the plot until f@xmath58 reaches as low as @xmath59 mjy .",
    "this is very different from the trend shown by the data .",
    "the reason for the difference between the density evolution model and the luminosity evolution models is that for a given redshift , say z=1 which allows the 6  8.5@xmath0 emission features to be included in the lw3 bandpass , galaxies are much fainter in pure density evolution models compared to those in pure luminosity evolution models , therefore the bump caused by the k - correction due to the mir emission features occurs in much fainter flux density levels ( see xu et al .",
    "1998 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "strong constraints on galaxy evolution can be obtained when the redshift information of a flux - limited sample is available .",
    "aussel et al .",

    "the histogram of the redshifts of 17 of these sources with @xmath60 mjy is compared to the model predictions by the three models presented in fig.4 . a sky coverage of 16 acrmin@xmath61 ( aussel et al 1999 ) and a correction factor of 2 for the incompleteness are assumed in these calculations .",
    "all three luminosity evolution models give reasonably good fits to the data in the bins with @xmath62 , and over - predict the counts in bins of @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , both the model with turnover at z=1.5 and the model without turnover predict some sources ( 6 by the former and 10 by the latter ) with z@xmath64 while none are found in the data . for the model with turnover at z=1.5 , the best fitting model in fig.4 , the missing of sources at @xmath65 could be due to small number statistics or to the incompleteness of the data at high redshifts .",
    "this highlights the demand for larger and more complete redshift samples of iso sources .",
    "in fact , when redshifts for a large ( a few hundred ) and complete flux limited sample are available , luminosity functions of iso sources can be calculated for different redshift epochs which will give the most direct information about the evolution of these sources .",
    "the reasonably good fits to both the source counts ( fig.4 ) and the redshift distribution ( fig.5 ) by the three luminosity evolution models ( in particular the model of l@xmath47 with a turnover at @xmath48 ) demonstrate that indeed the narrow peak of the isocam 15@xmath0 counts can be well explained by the effect of broadband mir emission features which is the essential element of the model of xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and there is no need to invoke a new population. at the same time , the evolution rate implied by the model fit is much stronger than those given by previous studies on iras sources ( l@xmath66 , pearson and rowan - robinson 1996 ; lonsdale et al .",

    ".      pure density evolution , which gives a poor fit to the number counts , can be ruled out with high confidence .",
    "given that any density evolution will push the peak in the number counts to fainter flux levels than shown by the data , it is quite certain that , as far as the choice between density and luminosity evolution is concerned , luminosity evolution is the dominant cause of the high number counts .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with that of blain et al .",
    "( 1999a ) which is obtained from a completely different argument , namely that a pure density evolution model which can fit the ir / submm counts will produce too much ir / submm background .",
    "our results show that the narrow peak of the isocam 15@xmath0 counts at about 0.4 mjy may not be used as an evidence for a new population of faint mir sources . on the other hand , a luminosity evolution in the luminosity function of infrared galaxies , as suggested by our best fitting model",
    ", does not necessarily mean that it is the same galaxies that we are seeing in the local universe that are shining tens or even hundreds times brighter in the early epochs of the universe .",
    "indeed , the preliminary results of optical identifications of isocam lw3 sources indicate that beyond @xmath72 most of them are interacting galaxies ( aussel et al .",
    "1999 ; elbaz et al .",
    "1999 ) , while the local mir selected extragalactic sources are mostly single late type galaxies similar to the milky way ( rush et al .",
    "1993 ) . given the high incompleteness of the redshift data , at this stage the major constraint on the evolution of isocam sources is from the counts , which is mostly determined by how the luminosity function evolves around l@xmath73 ( the luminosity distribution of sources in a given f@xmath58 bin peaks strongly around l@xmath73 ) .",
    "therefore , without any extrapolation , what we know now is that whatever the population of ir sources is at redshift @xmath74 , its comoving density is about the same as the ir galaxies in the local universe , while the characteristic 15@xmath0 luminosity of the faint sub - mjy sources is about 20 times the @xmath36 of local ir galaxies , namely at the @xmath75 l@xmath35 level . if these sources are indeed similar to the local gas - rich spiral - spiral galaxy pair systems , which dominate the bright end ( @xmath76l@xmath35 ) of iras luminosity function ( xu and sulentic 1991 ) , the implied density enhancement of these sources at @xmath74 compared to their density in the local universe is more than an order of magnitude .",
    "although the population of these interacting galaxies is not really new ( i.e. they are already important contributors of mir counts in the local universe ) , it is quite possible that this population may evolve much faster than normal late - type galaxies , and even than agns . for the sake of simplicity , we have treated all ir galaxies as a single population in our model and have not considered any differential evolution ( i.e. different evolution rates for galaxies with different luminosities ) .",
    "when more constraints on the nature of 15@xmath0 sources are available from future follow - up observations , a model treating the evolution of different galaxy populations differently ( e.g. separating interacting galaxies from single galaxies and agns ) , such as the model by franceschini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , will be more appropriate .",
    "our results also suggest that the mir emission features are present in the seds of galaxies with redshifts up to @xmath74 . whether this is still true for galaxies with even larger redshifts",
    "will be found out by the future sirtf mission ( cruikshank and werner 1997 ) .",
    "if so , these features will facilitate a powerful new method of obtaining redshifts in infrared for the optically faint , heavily extinguished galaxies .",
    "as for the question of whether galaxy evolution has a turnover at z=12 , our results are not conclusive , though a positive answer is favoured by the model fits ( fig.4 ) . given the significant effect of the mir emission features , which happens to affect the 15@xmath0 counts at redshift just below z=1.5 , the turnover favoured by our model may well be a false signal .",
    "deep surveys at longer wavelengths ( e.g. at 25@xmath0 and 70@xmath0 using the sirtf / mips detector arrays ) where the mir features will be redshifted into the bandpass at larger z , are certainly desirable for the determination of the evolution of ir galaxies beyond z=1.5 ( xu et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "how much do these sources contribute to the cosmic ir / sub - mm background radiation ? to answer this question , a monte carlo simulation based on the source count model of xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was carried out , assuming the galaxy evolution model that gives the best fit to the data in fig.4 ( l@xmath47 with a turnover at @xmath48 ) .",
    "sources with certain @xmath31 and z are generated according to predictions of the number count model , and ir seds taken from the sed sample of 1406 galaxies in xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are assigned to these sources in accordance with their rest frame @xmath31 .",
    "it should be noted that the seds modeled by xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) stop at 120@xmath0 .",
    "in order to estimate the contribution from mir galaxies to the ir background radiation at longer wavelengths , we have assumed that the ir emission at @xmath77 of all sources generated in the simulation has the same spectrum specified by a modified blackbody with @xmath78k and the emissivity index of @xmath79 ( blain et al .",
    "1999 ) . in reality , this submm sed may only apply to the luminous ir starburst galaxies ( lirgs ) while the seds of less active galaxies are likely to be much colder ( eales et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , since the largest contribution to the submm background is from lirgs ( blain et al . 1999 ) , we neglect this complication here .    for",
    "any given wavelength , all the fluxes from these simulated sources are summed up , resulting in the predicted contribution of the population of @xmath19 sources at the wavelength in question .",
    "again we assume that galaxy formation starts at z=5 .",
    "in fig.7 , this prediction ( the solid curve ) is plotted against several measurements / upper - limits of the ir / submm background .",
    "the upper - limits are all from the studies of tev gamma - ray sources ( dwek & slavin 1994 ; stanev & franceschini 1998 )",
    ". the filled circles with error bars are cobe / dirbe results taken from lagache et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and the large crosses are from scuba results ( blain et al .",
    "the two dashed curves outline the range of the submm ir background detected by cobe / firas ( fixen et al .",
    "according to our results , the contribution of the mir galaxies to the background between 1030@xmath80 is at the 4 nw / m@xmath61/sr level , compared to the results reported by elbaz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the 15@xmath0 background due to sources brighter than 50@xmath81jy is 3.3 nw / m@xmath61/sr .",
    "note that this already meets the upper - limits obtained by stanev and franceschini ( 1998 ) from the analysis of tev emission of mrk501 . at longer wavelengths",
    ", the predicted contribution to the background emission agrees very well with the dirbe points , and lies slightly above the upper - boundary of the measured submm background .",
    "compared to the results of previous calculations on the cosmic ir background using ` backward evolution ' models ( hacking and soifer 1991 ; beichman and helou 1991 ; malkan and stecker 1998 ) , the category this work belongs to , our result is about a factor of 2 higher because the evolution rate hinted at by isocam 15@xmath0 surveys is significantly stronger than those used in the previous works .",
    "our result is in agreement with elbaz et al ( 1999 ) , who found that the isocam 15@xmath0 sources may be able to account for the majority of the ir / submm background .",
    "taken at face value , the result in fig.7 indicates that nearly all of the sources contributing significantly to the ir / submm background are already present in the population of 15@xmath0 sources detected by iso , and very little room is left for any missing new population which can be significant energy sources of the ir / submm sky .",
