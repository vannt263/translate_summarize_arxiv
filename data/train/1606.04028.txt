    "the prospect of observing neutrinoless double-@xmath0 ( @xmath6 ) decay is of great current interest , and is considered an essential probe to address outstanding questions concerning the nature of the neutrino  @xcite .",
    "its observation would immediately inform us that the neutrino is majorana in nature and thus , that lepton number is not a conserved quantity , demanding modifications to the standard model . beyond that , a measurement of the half - life of @xmath6 decay would provide access to the effective mass of the neutrino and thus a scale for the absolute mass of the neutrino .",

    "the nuclear matrix elements for @xmath6 decay are based on theoretical calculations using various nuclear - structure models . for any given @xmath6-decay candidate the results vary by a factor of 2 - 3 , which translates to as much as an order of magnitude in the predicted half - lives .",
    "reducing this discrepancy in the nuclear matrix elements is a major challenge .",
    "it is still not clear which theoretical approach is most applicable and what ingredients are most relevant ( see , for example , ref .",

    "there is no simple connection between double-@xmath0 decay with and without neutrinos , as far as the nuclear matrix element is concerned  @xcite .",
    "the change in the ground - state nucleon occupancies _ must _ be important  @xcite .",
    "which neutrons decay and which protons are created in the decay , and how their configurations are rearranged , can be probed in single - nucleon transfer reactions to a level of precision corresponding to a few tenths of a nucleon .",
    "calculations can then be directly compared to the experimentally derived single - nucleon occupancies .",
    "the neutron and proton occupancies of the ground states of @xmath7ge and @xmath7se , and their change in the @xmath7ge  @xmath2  @xmath7se decay , were published in refs .",
    "for that system , theoretical calculations explored the impact on the magnitude of the calculated nuclear matrix elements based on modifications to reproduce the experimental occupancies  @xcite and found almost a factor of 2 reduction in the discrepancy between different models .",

    "this is the same for both the @xmath1te  @xmath2  @xmath1xe and @xmath3xe  @xmath2  @xmath3ba decays , where the change in proton occupancies are , not surprisingly , similar .",
    "this is generally reflected in the calculations where there is , at least , a qualitative agreement . both shell - model calculations , sm1 and sm2 ,",

    "the plots highlight the fact that the calculations differ by @xmath730.5 nucleons ( @xmath7325% ) in some cases , and most importantly this is in the cases of the @xmath74 and @xmath75 orbitals , which are dominant in this process and likely have significant impact on the magnitude of the nuclear matrix element . within the experimental uncertainties ,",
    "it is difficult to draw conclusions about the @xmath76 and @xmath77 strengths ; they play only small roles in the occupancy and thus one would not expect them to play a major role in the magnitude of the nuclear matrix element .",
    "the valence neutrons participating in the decay are just below @xmath18 .",
    "while the valence orbital space is the same for neutrons as that for protons , it is found to be truncated , with the @xmath78 orbital playing no observable role in the change between the @xmath1te and @xmath1xe ground states .",
    "an experimental limit of @xmath430.1 nucleons in the vacancy of the @xmath78 orbital , set in the neutron - adding ( @xmath24,@xmath5he ) reaction at 50 mev which are conditions favorable for the population of @xmath70 strength , has been made in ref .",
    "@xcite . aside from this , the most noticeable feature in the comparison between theory and experiment is the significant underestimation of the change in @xmath79 strength , assumed to be predominantly the @xmath80 strength , in the calculations .",
    "there appears to be quite good agreement for the other orbitals , though this agreement is perhaps augmented by the lack of @xmath78 in the experimental data .",
    "any calculations used to determine nuclear matrix elements should be able to reproduce the nucleon occupancies , and how they change in the decay process , to a reasonable degree of precision ; at present they do not .",
    "the experimental data , within uncertainties , reflect the change in the 0@xmath25 ground - state wave functions .",
    "the occupancy of the valence orbitals is one nuclear - structure property that may help constrain the nuclear matrix element calculations .",
    "other features of the nuclear structure are being explored along with alternative approaches to calculating nuclear - matrix - element calculations .",
    "an important feature probed in two - nucleon transfer reactions is the presence of pairing vibrations .",
    "these are characterized by strong 0@xmath25 excitations which represent a second sea of correlated neutrons or protons .",

    "there is a quantitative disagreement between the experimental data and recent calculations of the same properties .",
    "there is no particular model , at least from comparisons with the results of sm , ibm , and qrpa calculations , that fully describes the experimental occupancy data , and therefore the nuclear structure of the isotopes involved in @xmath6-decay , better than the others .",
