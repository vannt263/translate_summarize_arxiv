    "n49b is an x - ray - bright supernova remnant ( snr ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the presence of a nearby h ii region @xcite and a molecular cloud @xcite suggested a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) explosion of a massive star for the origin of n49b .",
    "the shock expansion in an interstellar cavity was suggested by the _ asca _",
    "data @xcite , which was supportive of its massive progenitor star . based on _ chandra _ data we detected a large variation in the surface brightness of the swept - up interstellar medium ( ism ) , which indicates that the snr is expanding into an ambient medium with an order of magnitude density variation along the outer boundary of the snr , generally consistent with the shock interaction with nearby molecular clouds (",
    "* p03 hereafter ) .",
    "data allowed us to detect the shocked metal - rich ejecta in n49b for the first time ( p03 ) .",
    "the detected metal - rich ejecta gas is enriched only in mg , and the estimated large mass for the mg - rich ejecta gas firmly established a very massive progenitor , and thus a core - collapse origin for n49b ( p03 ) . the putative compact stellar remnant has not been detected , and a 3@xmath5 upper limit on the central source luminosity ( @xmath6 @xmath7 2 @xmath8 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath10 ) was placed based on the _ chandra _ data ( p03 ) .    it is notable that only two snrs , including n49b , ( out of @xmath0500 snrs detected in the galaxy and magellanic clouds ) show this characteristic mg - overabundance ( while _ no other _ metal elements are similarly enhanced ) : the galactic snr g284.31.8 is the other member of this peculiar group @xcite .",
    "the true nature and origin of the _ only - mg - rich _ ejecta in these snrs are unclear .",
    "it might have resulted from a peculiar core - collapse nucleosynthesis , or a particular thermal condition in the ejecta gas might be responsible for the observed mg line enhancement . if the observed mg - rich nature ( without enhancements in o and ne ) represents the true metal abundance structure in these snrs , it may challenge the standard core - collapse nucleosynthesis models in which an invariably larger amount of o and ne ( than mg ) is expected to be created ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "n49b is particularly important to study this rare group of snrs because it appears that the bulk of the shocked mg - rich ejecta gas has been detected ( whereas the mg - rich ejecta in g284.31.8 is detected in a small part of the snr ) .",
    "the detection of the _ entire _ mg - rich ejecta in n49b allows us a unique opportunity to study the overall nature of the ejecta , such as the total shocked ejecta mass and its spatial structure , in this peculiar snr .",
    "we here report the presence of an emission feature in n49b , extending from the central ejecta regions out to the southeastern outer boundary of the snr .",
    "this elongated region is enriched only in mg just like the bulk of the metal - rich ejecta gas in the central region of the snr .",
    "this extended mg - rich emission feature was hinted at by the mg line equivalent width ( ew ) image in the previous _ chandra _ data analysis ( p03 ) , but was not discussed in p03 . in this work we focus on the spectral and morphological properties of this particular feature .",
    "we present the data and data analysis in sections  2 & 3 , respectively . in section  4",
    "we discuss the nature of the elongated mg - rich ejecta .",
    "n49b was observed with the s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board _ chandra _ on 2001 september 15 as part of the guaranteed time observation program ( p03 ) .",
    "we reprocessed these archival _ chandra _ data ( obsid 1041 ) of n49b ( using ciao version 4.2 with caldb version 4.3.0 ) .",
    "we processed the raw event file following the standard data reduction methods which include the correction for the charge transfer inefficiency .",
    "we applied the standard data screening by event status and grade ( _ asca _ grades 02346 ) .",
    "as noted by p03 the overall light curve from the entire s3 chip shows a moderately enhanced particle background ( by a factor of @xmath02 above the average quiescent count rate ) for the last @xmath010% of the exposure .",
    "we excluded this part of the data ( @xmath04-ks time interval ) from our analysis .",
    "after the data reduction the total effective exposure is @xmath030.2 ks .",
    "the broadband acis image of n49b shows a nearly circular overall morphology with several relatively bright filaments located mostly around the outer boundary of the snr ( figure  [ fig : fig1]a ) .",
    "the central regions of n49b , in which x - ray emission is dominated by the shocked mg - rich ejecta ( p03 ) , are generally faint and diffuse without showing any well - organized emission feature ( corresponding to the mg - enhanced regions ) .",
    "the mg - rich ejecta gas was identified aided by a mg k@xmath11 line ( at @xmath12 @xmath0 1.35 kev ) ew image ( p03 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig1]b we reproduce the mg line ew image of n49b as was presented in p03 . to create figure  [ fig :",
    "fig1]b we followed the same methods used by p03 ( and references therein ) .",
    "we used the same photon energy bands for the mg k@xmath11 line ( @xmath12 = 1280  1440 ev ) , and for the adjacent continuum ( @xmath12 = 1140  1240 and 1550  1700 ev , to estimate the underlying continuum flux ) as those selected by p03 .",
    "while the bright mg line ew in the central region of the snr is evident , the enhanced mg line clearly extends to the southeast ( region e in figure  [ fig : fig1]b ) .",
    "this enhanced line ew feature is elongated ( @xmath020@xmath13 in thickness and @xmath065@xmath13 in length ) , extending from the central mg - rich ejecta region out to the outermost southeastern boundary of the snr .",
    "this feature was hinted at in figure  2 of p03 ( although it appeared to be less clear than that in figure  [ fig : fig1]b , probably due to a different smoothing method adopted by p03 ) , but it was not discussed by p03 as they focused on the detection of the central mg - rich ejecta .    to quantitatively assess the apparently mg - enhanced nature of this region we extracted the observed x - ray spectrum from region e ( as shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the x - ray emission in this region contains @xmath07300 counts in the 0.4  5 kev band .",
    "we binned the extracted spectrum to contain at least 20 counts per photon energy channel .",
    "we fit this spectrum with a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plane shock model ( vpshock in xspec , borkowski et al . 2001 ) .",
    "we used nei version 2.0 in xspec , associated with atomdb @xcite which includes inner - shell lines ( from li - like ions ) and updated fe - l shell transition lines ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the plane shock model used by p03 did not include these additional x - ray lines which could affect the estimates of the thermal parameters ( and thus elemental abundances ) for an under - ionized gas . in these spectral model",
    "fits we assumed two components for the foreground absorbing column : one for the galactic absorption toward the lmc ( @xmath14 ) and the other for the lmc column ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we fixed @xmath14 at 6 @xmath8 10@xmath16 @xmath17 @xcite with solar abundances @xcite .",
    "we fitted @xmath15 assuming the lmc abundances @xcite .    for the plane shock component we initially fixed all elemental abundances at the lmc values :",
    "i.e. , he = 0.89 , c = 0.303 , n = 0.123 , ar = 0.537 , ca = 0.339 , ni = 0.618 @xcite , and o = 0.13 , ne = 0.20 , mg = 0.20 , si = 0.28 , s = 0.31 , fe = 0.15 @xcite .",

    "we fixed the redshift parameter at @xmath18 = 9.54 @xmath8 10@xmath19 for the radial velocity of the lmc @xcite .",
    "the electron temperature ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant ) and ionization timescale ( @xmath22 = @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the electron density and @xmath25 is the time since the gas has been shocked ) are varied . the normalization parameter ( a scaled volume emission measure , em = @xmath24@xmath26@xmath27 , where @xmath26 is the h density and @xmath27 is the emission volume ) is also varied .",
    "the fit is statistically unacceptable ( @xmath28 @xmath0 2.4 ) due to large residuals around the mg k line feature ( @xmath12 @xmath0 1.35 kev ) .",
    "also , there is significant excess emission at @xmath12 @xmath4 2 kev above the best - fit model ( @xmath20 @xmath0 0.6 kev ) .",
    "the observed x - ray spectrum in this high energy tail shows negligible ( or very weak ) k - shell line emission features from s ( @xmath12 @xmath0 2.4  2.6 kev ) , ar ( @xmath12 @xmath0 3.1  3.3 kev ) , and ca ( @xmath12 @xmath0 3.9  4.1 kev ) .",
    "varying the mg abundance significantly improves the fit ( @xmath28 @xmath0 1.4 ) , and the best - fit mg abundance is @xmath00.52 , higher than the lmc value by a factor of @xmath02.6 , suggesting the presence of overabundant mg . when we additionally varied abundances for o , ne , si , and fe ( whose k- and/or l - shell transition lines are prominent in our fitted 0.4  5.0 kev band ) , the statistical improvement of the model fit is not significant ( @xmath28 @xmath0 1.3 )",
    ". the best - fit mg abundance does not change ( mg = 0.52 ) , while all other fitted abundances are consistent with the lmc values within uncertainties .",
    "it is notable that , even with varying abundances , the significant excess emission at @xmath12 @xmath4 2 kev is evident for the best - fit electron temperature @xmath20 @xmath0 0.6 kev .",
    "thus , although the best - fit one - temperature model may be considered to be statistically acceptable ( @xmath28 @xmath0 1.3  1.4 ) , we added another nei plane shock component in our spectral model to properly fit the excess emission at @xmath12 @xmath1 2 kev .",
    "for the two - component model fit we initially fixed all metal abundances at the lmc values for both components , while varying other model parameters .",
    "the fit is statistically unacceptable ( @xmath28 @xmath0 2.0 ) .",
    "it is clear that the best - fit model underestimates the strong mg line at @xmath12 @xmath0 1.35 kev .",
    "all other emission line features are adequately fitted .",
    "the bulk of x - ray emission at @xmath12 @xmath29 1 kev is fitted by the k lines from h- and he - like o and ne ions ( and some l - shell transition lines from fe ions ) with the lmc - like abundances .",
    "thus , we fixed all metal abundances at the lmc values for the soft component assuming that this component is dominated by the emission from the shocked lmc ism .",
    "we consider the hard component spectrum to originate primarily from the shocked mg - rich ejecta , and thus varied the mg abundance ( with all other elements being fixed at the lmc abundances ) for the hard component .",
    "the model fit significantly improves ( @xmath28 @xmath0 1.0 ) . the best - fit mg abundance for the hard component ( @xmath30 @xmath0 1.55 kev ) is 0.93 .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ tbl : tab1 ] .",
    "the observed spectrum of region e ( with this best - fit two - component plane shock model overlaid ) is shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] . in these spectral model fits of the region",
    "e spectrum we assumed the recent measurements of the lmc abundances for o , ne , mg , si , and fe ( except for the mg abundance in the ejecta component spectrum ) based on the _ chandra _ data of the lmc snrs @xcite , while we adopted lmc abundance values by russell & dopita ( 1992 ) for other elements .",
    "we note that , for the lmc abundances , several measurements are available in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are some inconsistencies ( up to by a factor of @xmath02 ) among those abundance measurements , whose origins are not fully understood : e.g. , the cross - calibrations over different wavelengths and instruments , the use of different objects ( stars , snrs , hii regions ) , the model dependence of measurements , etc .",
    "we find no considerable effects on our spectral model fits depending on the choice of a specific lmc abundance set .",
    "the fitted parameters are consistent within statistical uncertainties with equally - good fits : e.g. , assuming the higher ( and more traditional ) values of the lmc abundances ( o = 0.26 , ne = 0.33 , si = 0.31 , mg = 0.32 and fe = 0.36 ) measured by russell & dopita ( 1992 ) , we find that the mg abundance for the hard ( ejecta ) component is 1.12@xmath31 with a nearly the same electron temperature ( @xmath20 @xmath0 1.54 kev ) , ionization timescale ( @xmath22 @xmath0 0.7 @xmath8 10@xmath32 @xmath33 s ) , and the volume emission measure ( @xmath00.5 @xmath8 10@xmath34 @xmath33 ) as listed in table  [ tbl : tab1 ] . for all other regional spectral analysis",
    "as presented in section  [ subsec : other ] , we fit the ism abundances for o , ne , mg , si , and fe in our spectral model fits , while fixing other elemental abundances at values by russell & dopita ( 1992 ) .    when we varied abundances for o , ne , si , and fe ( as well as mg ) in the hard component plane shock model fit , the statistical goodness - of - the - fit is nearly the same ( @xmath28 @xmath0 1.0 ) with similar main results : i.e. , mg is overabundant ( @xmath01.5 ) with a high electron temperature ( @xmath20 @xmath0 4 kev ) .",
    "the ne abundance appears to be elevated ( @xmath00.7 ) with a negligible fe abundance ( @xmath70.04 ) .",
    "these ne and fe abundances are somewhat different than those presented in table  [ tbl : tab1 ] , and are potentially interesting to reveal the true nature of the ejecta composition and the sn nucleosynthesis of this snr .",
    "however , the statistical improvement of this model fit is negligible , compared to that with the lmc abundances for those elements .",
    "nonetheless , these ( possibly non - lmc like ) ne and fe abundances do not affect our conclusions on the mg - rich ejecta in region e. finally , we considered a power law ( pl ) spectrum to fit the high energy tail of the region e spectrum .",
    "the model fit ( plane shock + pl ) is statistically good ( @xmath28 @xmath0 0.9 ) .",
    "the mg overabundance is evident ( @xmath00.92 ) with lmc - like abundances for all other fitted elements , but a low temperature ( @xmath20 @xmath0 0.34 kev ) is implied for the mg - rich ejecta gas . the best - fit pl photon index ( @xmath35 @xmath0 2.4 )",
    "is consistent with that for the synchrotron radiation from relativistically - accelerated shocked electrons in the shell - type snr n49b @xcite .",
    "however , the radio data of n49b show the _ lack _ of such non - thermal emission generally in the southern regions of the snr @xcite , particularly in regions corresponding to region e ( see section  4 ) .",
    "we consider that the physical origin of this phenomenologically - motivated pl model component is uncertain , and that the main results of the mg - rich ejecta for region e are persistent . in the following discussion of region e",
    ", we assume the best - fit parameters from our two - component plane shock model fit with the lmc abundances for metal elements other than mg ( as presented in table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) , unless noted otherwise .",
    "we performed a similar spectral analysis of central mg - rich ejecta regions . to characterize thermal condition and metal abundance for the central ejecta region , we extracted x - ray spectra from regions a  d as marked in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we selected these regions to represent _ all _ characteristic subregions showing the strong mg line ew , while achieving significant photon count statistics of @xmath45000 counts per region .",
    "we fit these regional spectra with the nei plane shock model generally following the method described in section  [ subsec : jet ] .",
    "as expected these regional spectra can not be fitted by the lmc abundances ( @xmath28 @xmath0 3  5 ) because of the significant discrepancy between the spectral model and the observed spectrum for the strong mg k emission line feature .",
    "varying the mg abundance results in statistically acceptable fits ( @xmath28 @xmath0 0.9  1.3 ) for all four regional spectra .",
    "we note that , in contrast to region e , there is no excess emission above the best - fit model at @xmath12 @xmath4 2 kev for these central regions . the best - fit mg abundance is significantly higher than the lmc value ( by a factor of @xmath046 ) for all four regions . while the lmc abundances for o , ne , si , and fe can adequately fit the observed spectra of these central regions , for the purposes of statistical comparisons of metal abundances among the central ejecta regions and the shocked ism regions , we fitted abundances for o , ne , si , and fe as well as mg in this work .",
    "as perhaps expected , best - fit abundances for o , ne , si , and fe are consistent with the lmc values within statistical uncertainties , except for the moderately elevated si abundance in region a ( by a factor of @xmath02 above the lmc abundance ) .",

    "[ fig : fig3 ] we show the observed spectra ( with the best - fit nei plane shock model overlaid ) for regions a ",
    "d.    we extract spectra from thirteen regions ( regions 1  13 in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) for which our mg ew image shows no enhancements .",
    "x - ray emission in these regions presumably originates from the shocked ism with lmc - like abundances ( p03 ) .",
    "we selected these regions to characteristically represent bright filaments and faint diffuse regions ( in the broadband image ) _ exterior _ to the enhanced mg ew regions , while achieving significant photon statistics of @xmath44000 counts in the 0.4  5 kev band .",
    "the observed x - ray spectra of these regions show weak atomic emission line features for all metal elements in contrast to regions a  e in which a strong mg line emission feature is evident .",
    "we show four example regional spectra from these shocked ism - dominated regions in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "we performed the nei plane shock model fits to these regional spectra with all metal abundances fixed at the lmc values .",
    "these model fits are acceptable with @xmath28 @xmath0 0.8  1.4 .",
    "when we varied metal abundances for o , ne , mg , si , and fe , fits are nearly the same ( @xmath28 @xmath0 0.8  1.3 ) with similar best - fit values for the fitted parameters .",
    "although these regional spectra can be fitted with metal abundances fixed at the lmc values , for the purposes of statistical comparisons with the ejecta - dominated regions , we use the results based on our spectral model fits with elemental abundances varied in this work .",
    "region 13 contains very faint outermost filaments in which we detect only @xmath0700 counts . our best - fit nei plane shock model fit for this regional spectrum shows generally similar results to those for other ism regions .",
    "however , because of significantly poorer photon count statistics in this regional spectrum , uncertainties on the best - fit values of the model parameters are large , and the measurements are less reliable for this region .",
    "thus , we do not present the quantitative measurements of our fitted spectral model parameters for this region .",
    "regions 5 and 10 also include relatively lower count statistics of @xmath02000 counts .",
    "our spectral model fits for these regions do not allow a unique solution , and result in large uncertainties on the best - fit values .",
    "spectra from these regions can be equally described by a few different nei plane shock model fits after fixing some parameters ( e.g. , @xmath36 and @xmath20 ) at the mean values of the neighboring regions . since results from those model fits",
    "are consistent ( within uncertainties ) , we present average values of the best - fit parameters between these alternative model fits for these two regions .",

    "we summarize these results in tables  [ tbl : tab2 ] & [ tbl : tab3 ] .",
    "our spectral analysis of the observed x - ray spectra for a number of subregions in n49b shows that mg is clearly overabundant in regions a ",
    "e when compared to that in ism - dominated regions ( figure  [ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to mg the estimated abundances for other metal elements ( o , ne , si , and fe ) are consistent with the lmc values throughout the entire snr ( figures  [ fig : fig5 ] & [ fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "this mg - only enhancement is consistently observed for region e in addition to regions a ",
    "d. the electron temperature and ionization timescale show similar ranges between the ejecta and ism regions ( probably except for region e , figure  [ fig : fig7 ] ) , suggesting that the observed enhancements in the mg line ew in n49b are primarily due to the mg overabundance .",
    "it is remarkable that x - ray emission from the shocked mg - rich ejecta gas apparently extends from the central ejecta regions ( regions a ",
    "d ) out to the southeastern outermost boundary of the snr .",
    "this extended mg - rich ejecta gas is confined in an elongated region ( region e in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) , presumably with a cylindrical geometry . the mg abundance in this region",
    "is estimated to be higher than the lmc abundance by a factor of @xmath05 , which is consistent with the mg overabundance detected in the central regions of this snr .",
    "it is interesting to find that the mg - rich ejecta gas in region e shows a significantly higher temperature ( @xmath20 @xmath0 1.6 kev ) than that of the central ejecta gas ( @xmath20 @xmath0 0.6 kev ) ( figure  [ fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "the mg overabundance and high electron temperature in region e are persistent between the northern and southern halves of region e ( although larger uncertainties are implied for the best - fit values due to lower count statistics in these half - regions ) .",

    "nonetheless , to produce such a large amount of mg from a core - collapse explosion of a progenitor star with an lmc - like metallicity , the progenitor masses of @xmath3 @xmath7 20 @xmath2 may be ruled out based on standard sn nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite .",
    "the southeastern elongation of the mg - rich ejecta might have been caused by a significantly non - uniform ambient medium , which might have allowed the ejecta gas to expand into the particular channel in the southeastern direction .",
    "the consistence in the ejecta composition ( i.e. , mg - rich ) between region e and the central ejecta regions ( regions a ",
    "d ) may support this interpretation .",
    "the radio and mid - infrared ( mir ) images of n49b show the _ lack _ of interstellar gas and dust in the south - southeastern regions of n49b @xcite , generally corresponding to region e ( figure  [ fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "this coincidence is more pronounced in the mir image than in the radio map .",
    "the northeastern and western regions of the snr ( roughly corresponding to regions a and b , respectively ) also show a similarly low mir emission with a correspondingly high mg abundance .",
    "this general anti - correlation between the mir intensity and the mg abundance is consistent with this scenario . in this interpretation",
    "the ejecta gas in region e might have been shocked multiple times to a higher temperature than that of the bulk of the ejecta gas , because it is confined within a relatively small , low - density volume surrounded by a high density medium .",
    "x - ray emission from multi - phase hot gas caused by reheating of the low - density gas in inter - cloud regions has been proposed for some other snrs interacting with clumpy clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is unclear whether the particular geometry and the ambient density structure of region e and its surrounding regions would suffice such a condition . a cylindrical geometry for region e would be effective to secure a small volume of the low - density gas , and thus for the reheating .",
    "the origin for the formation of such a cylindrical _ tunnel _ with a large scale ( @xmath05 pc @xmath8 16 pc ) in the ambient medium is unclear .",
    "although it is less pronounced , the northwestern outer boundary of n49b ( roughly corresponding to region 10 ) shows a low mir intensity similar to that in region em _",
    "spitzer _ image as shown in figure  1 of williams et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . ] .",
    "a similar extent of the mg - rich ejecta might be expected in this region , which is not the case . while the density - dependence of the radio flux is more complex than the mir dust emission , the anti - correlation of the radio intensity against the mg abundance is less clear .",
    "thus , while it is a plausible scenario , this interpretation remains speculative .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic simulations would be necessary to test this non - uniform medium interpretation for the observed elongated morphology of the hot mg - rich ejecta in n49b .    considering that a relatively high explosion energy ( @xmath56 @xmath0 4 @xmath8 10@xmath57 erg ) was estimated for n49b @xcite ( albeit this @xmath56 might have been somewhat overestimated as discussed by those authors ) , we entertain an alternative scenario for the origin of the elongated mg - rich ejecta in this snr .",
    "core - collapse sn explosions are considered to be more asymmetric than type ia thermonuclear sn , and such asymmetric explosions may be imprinted in their snrs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models for sn explosions driven by an energetic jet ( powered by accretion onto the central compact remnant , maeda & nomoto 2003 ) is particularly intriguing .",
    "this _ jet - driven _ snr scenario has been argued for to explain the observed elongated x - ray morphology of the metal - rich ejecta in the galactic snr w49b @xcite and the snr 010472.3 in the small magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "the elongated morphology for the southeastern metal - rich ejecta in n49b is generally consistent with the fossil of the jet - like outflow similar to those seen in w49b and 010472.3 .",
    "the estimated ejecta mass fraction ( @xmath010% of the total ejecta ) is also consistent with that predicted by the jet - driven sn models @xcite .",
    "however , the elongated ejecta emission in n49b is enriched in mg in contrast to the fe - rich ejecta found in w49b @xcite and 010472.3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the jet - driven sn models predict fe- and ni - rich ( created in the deepest core of the sn ) outflows , while lighter metals such as o , ne , and mg would show lower expansion velocities , and thus would likely be located near the central regions of the snr @xcite .",
    "formation of an energetic bi - polar outflow from the accretion onto the central compact remnant ( probably a black hole ) is expected in the jet - driven explosion @xcite . if region e in n49b",
    "were the relic of a jet - like ejecta outflow toward the southeast , one may expect a similar structure on the opposite side of the snr .",
    "we find no clear evidence for such a counter ejecta outflow toward the northwestern outer boundary of n49b ( figure  [ fig : fig1]b ) : i.e. , the likely location for such a feature would be region 10 in which metal overabundance is not detected .",
    "thus , alhough it may not be ruled out , the interpretation as a jet - driven sn for the origin of n49b is in question . nonetheless , we note that the central compact remnant has not been detected in n49b ( p03 ) .",
    "the estimated upper limit ( 3@xmath5 ) on the x - ray luminosity ( in the 0.5  5 kev band ) for the putative compact remnant is @xmath58 @xmath0 2 @xmath8 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath10 ( p03 ) .",
    "although this luminosity upper limit is not particularly constraining ( which still allows a non - detection of a normal neutron star due to a long distance to the lmc ) , it is not inconsistent with the creation of a black hole from a jet - driven sn explosion of a very massive star .    with the currently available data the origin of the elongated mg - rich ejecta in snr n49b remains elusive .",
    "further observational and theoretical studies are needed to help answer the fundamental questions related to this peculiar core - collapse snr : why is the metal - rich ejecta in this snr enriched only in mg , and what caused the southeastern elongation of the observed mg - rich ejecta ?",
    "deep high - resolution x - ray observations would be necessary to study the detailed spatial and spectral structures of the mg - rich ejecta in n49b and thus its origin , particularly to reveal the true nature of the hard component emission in region e. deep high - resolution radio and ir observations would be needed to study the detailed ambient structure to help unveil the origin of the southeastern extent of the mg - rich ejecta .",
    "such deep observations would also help to place observational constraints on the nature of the central compact remnant created in n49b , which is essential to understanding of the observational properties of this peculiar core - collapse snr .",
