    "[ fig : dteff15 ] shows , as a function of luminosity and effective temperature , the effective temperature difference between two isochrones at the same luminosity  : the standard one experiences no diffusion and its initial abundances are equal to the observed ones , while the second one is computed using our proposed calibration .",

    "let us cite a few signatures of the microscopic diffusion .",
    "* the predicted shift increases with age and decreases when [ fe / h ] increases ; * the mass - luminosity relationship is modified depending on z as at a given mass and age , as diffused and calibrated models are less luminous than standard ones ; * the slope of isochrones is slightly increased .",

    "a lot of progress is expected from the gaia mission ( perryman et al .",
