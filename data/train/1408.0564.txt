    "the non - commutative geometry ( ncg ) is the underlying geometry of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) . in the lowest landau level ( lll ) ,",
    "the electron coordinates are identified with the center of mass coordinates that satisfy the nc algebra : @xmath0=i{\\ell}^2.\\ ] ] almost a decade ago , the time - reversal symmetric counterpart of qhe , dubbed as quantum spin hall effect , was theoretically proposed @xcite and experimentally confirmed @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the 3d version of the quantum spin hall effect , topological insulator ( ti ) , was also discovered @xcite .",
    "now we understand there exist a variety of topological classes of qhe with different symmetries as summarized in the topological periodic table @xcite .",
    "one may wonder what kind of geometry will describe such tis .",
    "recently two groups , @xcite and @xcite , independently proposed the quantum nambu bracket @xcite for higher dimensional topological insulators . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors considered the quantum nambu 3-bracket for chiral tis ( aiii - class ) .",
    "meanwhile the authors in ref.@xcite adopted the the even dimensional quantum nambu - bracket for a - class tis , and 3-bracket for 3d ti .    inspired by the recent developments , we discuss a - class tis with emphasis on their relation to higher d. qhe and ncg .",
    "the a - class tis live in arbitrary even dimensional spaces and do not respect any symmetries such as time - reversal , particle - hole , and chiral symmetries like qhe . indeed qhe is a 2d entity of a - class tis , and the a - class tis can be regarded as higher d counterparts of the qhe , @xmath1 higher d. qhe . the higher d. qhe was first constructed by zhang and hu in 4d @xcite as a natural generalization of 2d qhe on haldane s sphere @xcite .",
    "their 4d model was soon generalized in even higher dimensions@xcite , such as complex projective spaces and even dimensional spheres . in the modern point of view",
    ", the higher d. qhe can be considered as a realization of the a - class ti with landau levels .",
    "ncg naturally fits in even dimensional space since each commutator needs a pair of nc coordinates , and so all of the even dimensional coordinates of a - class tis are neatly fitted in the commutators and ncg is realized in the whole space .",
    "thus , a - class tis are a good starting point to see what physical implications the higher d. ncg brings .",
    "we will discuss the spherical higher d. a - class tis @xcite on the basis of the former works @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of fuzzy two - sphere , @xmath2 , are defined so as to satisfy the @xmath3 algebra @xcite : = i_ijkx_k , ( i , j , k=1,2,3 ) [ fuzzytwosphere ] where @xmath4 .",
    "( @xmath5 corresponds to the @xmath3 spin magnitude . ) in general , the coordinates of @xmath6d fuzzy sphere @xmath7 satisfy @xcite = ix_ab , ( a , b=1,2 , , 2k+1 ) [ fuzzy2ksphere ] where @xmath8 denote the @xmath9 operators . for 3d ,",
    "the 2rank tensor is equivalent to the vector by the relation @xmath10 , and then ( [ fuzzytwosphere ] ) is realized as a special case of ( [ fuzzy2ksphere ] ) . except for the special 3d case @xmath11 , eq.([fuzzy2ksphere ] )",
    "is not closed only by @xmath12 themselves , but the extra operators @xmath8 are introduced on the right - hand side .",
    "there is another mathematical formulation for @xmath7 by using the nambu bracket @xcite : = i^kc(k , i)^2k-1_a_1 a_2 a_2k+1x_a_2k+1 , [ nambu2ksphere ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14\\equiv x_{[a_1 } , x_{a_2 } , \\cdots , x_{a_{2k}]}$ ] .",
    "eq.([nambu2ksphere ] ) is more elegant than eq.([fuzzy2ksphere ] ) in the sense that the @xmath9 operators do not apparently appear the algebra .",
    "thus , there are two superficially different mathematical formulations for higher d. fuzzy sphere .",
    "a simplest way to see the corresponding monopole set - up is to find the right - hand side of the nc algebra . from @xmath2 ( [ fuzzytwosphere ] ) , we can read off the dirac monopole field strength : f_ix_i .",
    "( i=1,2,3 ) similarly from ( [ fuzzy2ksphere ] ) and ( [ nambu2ksphere ] ) , we obtain the @xmath9 non - abelian monopole field strength @xcite and the @xmath15 tensor monopole field strength @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 denote the @xmath9 matrices .",
    "corresponding to the two different nc formulations , we obtain two different monopole set - ups .",
    "however , since the two nc formulations describe the same nc manifold , @xmath1 @xmath7 , the corresponding two monopole set - ups should be same in some sense .",
    "indeed there exists a simple correspondence : g_2k= ( f^2k ) .",
    "[ localcorrefandg ] for the fully symmetric representation @xmath18 $ ] , the right - hand side of ( [ localcorrefandg ] ) gives ( f^2k)=c_k(i)_a_1 a_2 a_2k+1x_a_2k+1dx_a_1 dx_a_2 dx_a_2k , [ tracef2k ] where @xmath19 denotes the @xmath20th chern - number of the @xmath9 monopole on @xmath21 .",
    "eq.([tracef2k ] ) is actually equivalent to the tensor monopole field strength : g_2k = g_k_a_1 a_2 a_2k+1x_a_2k+1dx_a_1dx_a_2dx_a_2k , with tensor monopole charge @xmath22 the monopole gauge fields are similarly related as c_2k-1=(l_^(2k-1)[a ] ) , [ canda2k-1 ] where @xmath23 $ ] denotes the chern - simons action in @xmath24d : l_^(2k-1)[a]= k_0 ^ 1 dt   ( a(tda+it^2a^2)^k-1 ) .",
    "[ generalexcernsimonsterm ] for instance , @xmath25=\\text{tr}a$ ] , @xmath26=\\text{tr } ( ada + \\frac{2}{3}i a^3)$ ] and @xmath27 = \\text{tr } ( a(da)^2 + \\frac{3}{2}ia^3da-\\frac{3}{5 } a^5)$ ] . by substituting the @xmath9 gauge field to the right - hand side of ( [ canda2k-1 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent a natural generalization of the dirac monopole gauge field @xmath31 . in general , the @xmath24 rank tensor monopole gauge field exhibits the @xmath20th power string - like singularity .    in the lowest landau level ( lll ) ,",
    "the covariant angular momentum vanishes and so the total angular momentum is identified with the field strength : l_ab=_ab+r^2f_ab  ~  r^2 f_ab .",
    "[ labfabident ] according to ( [ localcorrefandg ] ) , we have @xmath32 and with ( [ labfabident ] ) , we find that the coordinates in the lll become to x_a=  _ a a_1 a_2 a_2k(l_a_1 a_2l_a_3 a_4 l_a_2k-1 a_2k ) , [ xafromlas ] which obey the quantum nambu algebra ( [ nambu2ksphere ] ) .",
    "thus , the quantum nambu geometry naturally emergies in the lll of a - class tis .",
    "the non - abelian and tensor monopole correspondence brings important physical implications to the a - class topological insulators . in the original qhe",
    ", the chern - simons ( cs ) flux attachment is introduced to cancel the external @xmath15 magnetic field : a_1-c_1=0 .",
    "this cancellation is rather trivial in the sense both external and chern - simons gauge fields are abelian . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the external magnetic fields are non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "the non - abelian and tensor monopole correspondence tells that the non - abelian magnetic field can be canceled by @xmath33 gauge field : ( l_^(2k-1)[a])-c_2k-1=0 .",
    "for instance @xmath34 , we have @xmath35 due to this notable cancellation , we can generalize exotic ideas cultivated in the qhe to a - class tis , such as topological field theory description of qhe @xcite .",
    "we propose the following tensor - type chern - simons field theory for the a - class tis : s=_4k-1 c_2k-1j_2k+_4k-1c_2k-1g_2k , [ tensorchernsimonsaction ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denotes an odd integer in accordance with the filling factor @xmath38 the membranes described by the tensor chern - simons action ( [ tensorchernsimonsaction ] ) generally obey the fractional statistics related the linking number @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion of the chern - simons field yield j_2k=- g_2k .",
    "[ equationforcp+1 ] for component representation , eq.([equationforcp+1 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath39    [ generalhallflux ]    eqs.([generalhallflux ] ) represent generalized flux attachment and hall effect . the @xmath24-form chern - simons field",
    "is naturally coupled to @xmath40 dimensional membrane - like object , @xmath40-brane .",
    "since @xmath41 is an odd integer , the odd number fluxes are attached to membrane and the membrane becomes a composite object of the original membrane and the fluxes .",
    "since at @xmath42 , membrane corresponds to a fermion , the odd number @xmath43 flux attachment transmutes the statistics of the membrane to bose statistics just like composite boson .",
    "the groundstate of the a - class ti can be regarded as a superfluid state of the composite membranes . the fractionally charged quasi - particle in fractional qhe @xcite is also generalized to @xmath40-brane excitation with a fractional charge : e_2k-2^*=1/m^k .",
    "it turns out that the fractional charged membrane obeys the fractional statistics mediated by the tensor gauge field .",
    "particularly interesting property is the dimensional hierarchy . from the 0-brane picture ,",
    "the total filling factor is expressed as = _ 2_4_6 _",
    "2k=1/m^k(k+1 ) .",
    "[ dimhiernu ] the hierarchical structure of the filling factor may remind the haldane - halperin hierarchy of the fractional qhe @xcite , however notice that the hierarchy ( [ dimhiernu ] ) ranges over different dimensions not in the same dimension . according to the haldane - halperin s idea of the hierarchy ,",
    "the hierarchical structure of the filling fraction implies the condensation of quasi - excitations to form a new generation of incompressible liquid .",
    "the dimensional hierarchy of the filling fraction implies that the low dimensional membrane - like objects condense to make a higher dimensional quantum incompressible liquid of a - class tis .",
    "we exploited the a - class ti with emphasis on its relations to quantum nambu geometry .",
    "the main observations are summarized in fig.[summaryobservation ] .",
    "we showed that the exotic physics of qhe can naturally be generalized in a - class tis based on the non - abelian and tensor monopole correspondence .",
    "while we focused on the a - class tis , similar discussions can be expanded for aiii - class tis that live in arbitrary odd dimensional spaces @xcite .",
