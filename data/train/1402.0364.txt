    "plenty of motivations exist for considering the recently discovered higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) to be a member of a richer scalar structure beyond what is predicted by the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "an exciting possibility is the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite , which receives special attention because the minimal supersymmetric standard model relies on it .",
    "extremely tight experimental constraints on tree level flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) led to the glashow - weinberg - paschos theorem in the multi - higgs context@xcite .",
    "this implies that the absence of tree level fcnc will be ensured if all right - handed fermions of a given charge couple to a single higgs doublet . in 2hdm , this can be achieved by the introduction of discrete or continuous symmetries that act on the scalars and fermions . following the @xmath2 discrete symmetry under which @xmath3 and @xmath4 , four types of 2hdm emerge , based on the fermion transformations under that symmetry .",
    "they are classified as ( i ) type i : all quarks and leptons couple to only one scalar @xmath5 ; ( ii ) type ii : @xmath5 couples to up - type quarks , while @xmath6 couples to down - type quarks and charged leptons ( minimal supersymmetry conforms to this category ) ; ( iii ) type y ( or iii , or flipped ) : @xmath5 couples to up - type quarks and leptons , while @xmath6 couples to down - type quarks ; ( iv ) type x ( or iv , or lepton specific ) : @xmath5 couples to all quarks , while @xmath6 couples to all leptons .",
    "experimental constraint on the charged higgs mass in the type ii and y models is quite strong : @xmath7 gev for any @xmath8 , which is the ratio of the two vacuum expectation values .",
    "this arises mainly from the @xmath9 constraint , but this constraint is considerably weak in type i and x scenarios @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a special category of 2hdm formulated by branco , grimus and lavoura ( hereafter called the bgl scenario ) @xcite , where tree level fcnc exists with appropriate suppression arising from the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . unlike the general 2hdm with tree level fcnc @xcite , the bgl models introduce no new parameters in the yukawa sector , and therefore , are more predictive . in this scenario , instead of the discrete @xmath2 symmetry a global u(1 )",
    "symmetry acts on a particular generation @xmath10 at a time , as follows : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the left - handed quark doublet for the @xmath10-th generation ( @xmath13 ) , while @xmath14 denotes the up - type right - handed quark singlets , all in the weak basis .",
    "the scalar doublet @xmath6 and the other quark fields remain unaffected by this transformation . for this particular choice of the symmetry",
    ", there will be no fcnc in the up sector and the fcnc in the down sector will be controlled by the @xmath10-th row of the ckm matrix .",
    "this will lead to three variants which will be called u- , c- and t - type models according to @xmath15 1 , 2 , and 3 respectively in eq .",
    "( [ bgl symmetry ] ) with @xmath16 ( down - type singlet ) , as a result of which there will be no fcnc in the down sector and the fcnc in the up sector will be controlled by the columns of the ckm matrix .",
    "we do not consider this scenario primarily because the fcnc in the up sector is less restrictive . ] .",
    "a number of low - energy observables severely constrain the u- and c - type models , as we will show later ; so it makes sense to talk about the t - type model only .",
    "we will also show from the same observables that in the t - type model one can entertain charged higgs mass in the ballpark of 150 gev for @xmath17 . in fact , the additional scalars , namely , the cp - even @xmath18 and the cp - odd @xmath19 together with the charged scalar @xmath20 , could all be taken in the 100 - 200 gev mass range .",
    "these light scalars would leave distinct decay signatures in the collider experiments . by comparing their branching ratios in various flavor channels , it is possible to distinguish the bgl scalars from the light ones predicted in type i and x models .",
    "our study assumes special significance in view of the 14 tev run of the lhc , its possible upgrade to higher luminosity , and the possibility of precision studies at the international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the bgl model .",
    "section iii deals with the low - energy constraints on the model . in particular",
    ", we show that the bgl model allows a light charged higgs .",
    "we also point out the differences between bgl and other 2hdms .",
    "the decay patterns and possible signatures of the nonstandard scalars are discussed in section iv .",
    "we summarize and conclude in the last section .",
    "the appendices contain all the relevant formulae that have gone into our calculations .",
    "the scalar potential of the bgl model is identical to the other canonical 2hdms .",
    "this scenario is manifestly cp conserving .",
    "let us denote the cp - even neutral components of @xmath6 and @xmath5 by @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , with @xmath23 .",
    "they are of course weak eigenstates .",
    "the corresponding mass eigenstates @xmath18 and @xmath24 can be obtained by diagonalizing the @xmath25 mass matrix @xmath26 using an orthogonal transformation characterized by an angle @xmath27 , given by @xmath28 by convention , we will take @xmath29 , and @xmath24 to be the 125 gev scalar resonance discovered at the lhc .    to study the yukawa sector of the bgl model , it is helpful to go to another neutral scalar basis @xmath30 .",
    "this is not the mass basis in general , and is obtained from the @xmath31 basis by a rotation through the angle @xmath32 .",
    "the same rotation picks out the physical charged higgs ( @xmath20 ) and charged goldstone ( @xmath33 ) , as well as the physical pseudoscalar ( @xmath19 ) and neutral goldstone ( @xmath34 ) , from their respective weak basis states . in the cp - even neutral sector ,",
