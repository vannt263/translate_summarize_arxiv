    "like other authors of this volume , i am much indebted to gerry brown .",
    "his decision to make me his successor , as a leader of stony brook nuclear theory , was obviously the highest honor of my life .",
    "twenty years of nearly daily discussion with gerry about physics , life and life in physics have not resulted in many common papers . yet those thousands of hours were invaluable , especially for me , after another twenty plus years in a relative solitude in novosibirsk .",
    "layers upon layers of knowledge came from gerry , on science , scientists and life , with good share of his characteristic jokes .",
    "it was not easy to select the topic for this article .",
    "gerry was seriously excited a decade ago , while induced by strongly coupled qgp ",
    "ismail zahed and myself returned to the fate of the coulomb bound states at the coupling approaching or exceeding the critical value : a subject close to his heart from large - z atoms and birmingham days . while progress since then include strongly coupled quarkonia in ads / cft and observations of supercritical resonances in graphene , theoretically this problem remains basically unsolved .",
    "on the other hand , progress in fields i was mostly involved lately ",
    "hydrodynamical description of higher flow harmonics in heavy ion collisions , or of the  explosive \" high multiplicity @xmath7 and even @xmath8  would not be so exciting to gerry .",
    "so i decided to return to the core issues of our science ",
    "chiral symmetry breaking , confinement and gauge topology .",
    "slow but steady progress is there , not much known outside of a narrow circle .",
    "it would interest gerry for sure .",
    "one way to describe this phenomenon  a `` 3-d manybody '' one  goes back to nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) paper based on an analogy to the bcs theory of superconductivity . a 4-fermion attraction at soft momenta @xmath9 , if strong enough , leads to a nonzero quark condensate ant a gap , at the surface of the dirac sea .",
    "another approach  a `` 4-dimensional single body '' one  is simpler to explain and to work with , in euclidean setting .",
    "dirac eigenvalues can be defined for any gauge fields configuration @xmath10 and those may have finite or zero density of states @xmath11 at @xmath12 .",
    "the former case breaks the chiral symmetry , and the condensate is just proportional to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the alternative case @xmath14 is chirally symmetric .",
    "this is reminiscent to the density of states at the fermi surface : if nonzero it definds a conductivity and many other properties of a _",
    ", if zero it makes it an insulator . in fig.[fig_zmz ] we sketch the shapes of such density of states is already taken .",
    "note also that for @xmath15 there exists the so called _ stern - smilga cusp _ @xmath16 in the middle .",
    "] , for @xmath17 ( left ) and @xmath18 ( middle ) .",
    "the right picture corresponds to the critical case , when @xmath19 vanishes and the chiral symmetry is being restored . at @xmath20",
    "there appears a finite gap around @xmath21 , like in an insulator .",
    "the idea that only a tiny subset of states near the fermi surface dominates the physics is one of the pillars of 20-th century condensed matter theory .",
    "similar fundamental concept is the _",
    "zero mode zone _ ( zmz ) introduced in the context of the instanton liquid model ( ilm ) @xcite .",
    "the topological index theorems demand a connection between the topological charge of the gauge fields and the number of _ exactly zero _ eigenvalues .",
    "thus a collection of well - separated instantons and antiinstantons produce many @xmath21 states , if interactions are neglected .",
    "if those are included , those states get _ collectivised _ , creating zmz , of various shapes we showed above .",
    "details about numerical simulations of instanton ensembles and actual zmz can be found in a review @xcite .",
    "lattice studies confirmed those , and show that the zmz states mix little with the  plane wave \"- type states of the perturbation theory .",
    "one crucial prediction of the ilm is the _ surprisingly small width _ of the zmz . in the instanton liquid model an amplitude describing  hopping \" of a quark from one instanton to",
    "the next determines this width , parametrically it is @xmath22 where the last value correspond to the mean instanton size @xmath23 and inter - instanton distance @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this fact is especially important for the validity of chiral perturbation theory , valid only if quark masses are small compared to @xmath25 .",
    "this 30-year old ( but still little known ) observations were supported by numerical studies of instanton ensembles in 1990 s , see review @xcite .",
    "lattice observation of the zmz states and pions  made of them \" followed a bit later and continue till this day @xcite .",
    "so , topological solitons and the zmz states they generate are truly responsible for chiral symmetry breaking in qcd .",
    "the graz group @xcite tried to enforce chiral symmetry by @xmath26 a small strip of near - zero modes from the propagators , making distribution in fig.[fig_zmz ] ( left ) into fig.[fig_zmz ] ( right ) .",
    "although only a tiny fraction @xmath27 of all quark states were affected , drastic changes in hadronic spectroscopy were observed , with the chiral pairs ( @xmath28 ) , ( @xmath29 ) getting near - degenerate .",
    "when the inverse thing is done  only the contribution _ from the strip _ kept in the propagators  graz group found that @xmath30 and @xmath31 bound states remained there , albeit with a bit reduced mass .",
    "the latter directly confirms results from the instanton liquid simulations done 20 years ago .",
    "an `` effective mass '' of a quasiparticle is usually defined as the end of the dispersion curve @xmath32 .",
    "delaying discussion of confinement for later , let us imagine we do the same for light quarks ( leading to masses of hadrons made of them ) .",
    "a hypothetical 4-fermion interaction introduced by nambu - jona - lasinio in 1961 has been identified with the instanton - induced t hooft interactions 20 years later @xcite . for a single quark flavor @xmath33 ( no d ) it is produces a mass .",
    "for @xmath17 it is indeed a 4-fermion vertex , as shown in fig.[fig_f1 ] ( left ) .",
    "however , it is not easy to generate a quark mass . in the chiral limit , left @xmath34 and right @xmath35-handed quarks do not interact directly , so one can not make @xmath36 into a loop and generate a chirally - odd mass term @xmath37 .",
    "adding an anti - instanton ( as in fig.[fig_f1 ] , right ) allows to loop unneeded quarks , but the resulting  mass operator \"  to which we will return below  is in fact chirally - even @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , _ any finite number of instantons and antinstantons _ generates such terms only .",
    "indeed , one needs the so called _ infinite cluster _ ( scaling with volume ) of instantons to break spontaneously the @xmath39 chiral symmetry .",
    "two types of masses are schematically indicated in fig.[fig_f2 ] .",
    "let me add a couple of digressions before proceeding .",
    "the t hooft vertex shown in fig.[fig_f1 ] ( left ) is also strong attraction in ud scalar diquark channel .",
    "this is responsible for most of the nucleon binding ( about 300 mev ) and its quark - diquark structure , as well as robust color superconductivity .",
    "another comment is that as @xmath40 grows , there are more legs and instanton finite clusters gets bound better , as a result , infinite cluster and chiral symmetry breaking disappear .",
    "lattice studies indeed have difficulty finding any trace of it for @xmath41 and more .",
    "the prevailing philosophy in 1990 s was that the  constituent quark mass \" is chirally odd @xmath3 only .",
    "its consequence ",
    "formulated most clearly in the famous brown - rho paper @xcite  is that when chiral symmetry gets restored the quarks ( and thus hadrons ) are expected to become lighter as well . yet",
    "several stubborn observations disagreed .",
    "one was the data on chemical freezeout in heavy ion collisions : while happening near chiral restoration @xmath42 , hadron chemistry works fine _ without _ any shifts in masses .",
    "the second was the na60 dilepton data , revealing the @xmath30 peak hardly shifted from its vacuum place .",
    "the third is the discovery of 2 solar mass pulsars , requiring extra repulsion in eos .",
    "all of those were discussed by others at the meeting .",
    "two more came from the lattice .",
    "higher susceptibilities  derivatives over the baryon chemical potential  allows to single out the contribution of baryons , and their analysis @xcite lead us to a conclusion , that as @xmath43 grows through @xmath1 , the nucleon mass does not go down and even seem to be @xmath44 . the same slowly growing rho and nucleon masses are seen by the graz group already mentioned @xcite : as more and more near - zero dirac eigenstates are removed , eventually enforcing chiral symmetry to become unbroken .",
    "so , what is going on here ?",
    "i think we need to include the chirally - even mass @xmath4 , coming from the quark energy @xmath45 which obtains contributions from the finite topological clusters . near @xmath1 , of the quark condensate ( and infinite cluster ) disappears , basically by breaking into finite ones .",
    "respectively the non - chiral mass @xmath3 partially morphs into the chiral one @xmath4 , while the total @xmath46 perhaps less affected .",
    "to calculate all of it , one however needs to do a lot of work , as we discuss below .",
    "now we jump to @xmath20 and recall few important issues .",
    "the vacuum average of the polyakov line @xmath47 changes from 1 to 0 as @xmath43 decreases through @xmath1 region .",
    "nonzero holonomy \" field gauge theory . ]",
    "@xmath48 changes from zero to  confining value \" the  chiral mass \" we speak about , but an imaginary chemical potential , a phase . ]",
    "@xmath49 at @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , models including @xmath5 such as the pnjl model possess @xmath50 : eliminating quark states from the partition function at @xmath51 . while unable yet to explain the flux tubes or kill all the gluons , those models clearly are important steps toward understanding confinement .    in 1998",
    "it has been discovered @xcite that a non - vanishing @xmath52 has drastic effect on the gauge topology : instantons split into @xmath6 ",
    "instanton dyons \" , topological solitons possessing not only topological charge , but also electric and magnetic ones .",
    "( for a review see @xcite . )",
    "so , the  instanton liquid \" should evolve into a  dyonic plasma \" , in which instantons  neutral clusters ",
    "coexist with their  ionized \" constituents .    even at a qualitative level , discussed in our first paper of this program @xcite the dyons",
    "had explained about a dozen puzzling lattice observations .",
    "an example : already in 1990 s it was observed that  quenched \" ( no quark determinant ) gauge ensembles provide chiral symmetry breaking at @xmath53 for antiperiodic fermions , but not for periodic ones .",
    "the answer : antiperiodic fermions have zero modes with  twisted \" l dyons , and periodic with  untwisted \" m dyons .",
    "their masses are not the same , @xmath34 are heavier than @xmath54 .",
    "so the same gauge configurations contained two quite different densities of relevant topological objects , and the denser one keeps chiral symmetry broken to higher @xmath43 .",
    "another significant benefit is related to the fact that when an instanton measure morphs into a product of @xmath6 ones for dyons , the transition to large @xmath6 becomes much less singular and puzzling .",
    "the gauge interactions between the instanton - dyons has been discussed in @xcite and earlier papers of diakonov et al .",
    "together with coulombic electric and magnetic forces , there are also confinement - like linear potential induced by the debye screening by ambient thermal quarks and gluons .",
    "the fermionic exchanges  related to zero modes  were worked out in @xcite .",
    "the partition function was finally formulated and the first direct numerical simulations of the instanton - dyon ensemble were performed @xcite .",
    "the dirac eigenvalue spectra were calculated and the necessary conditions  basically the dyon density  for the chiral symmetry breaking were identified .",
    "finally , let me mention that  unlike instantons - the instanton - dyons interact directly with the holonomy field @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in @xcite , the effective dyon - antidyon repulsion ( due to perturbative subtraction ) has the sign and the magnitude capable to explain why the holonomy shifts from zero to confinement value , as the dyon density grows .    for the first time",
    "we now see how _ the same _ topological objects are responsible both for chiral symmetry breaking and ( quasi)confinement .",
    "we now see why both phenomena require high enough topological density , albeit maybe different ones at large @xmath40 .",
    "we are now working on more quantitative derivation , of an effective pnjl - type model , in which both inputs  the holonomy potental and the njl term  are generated dynamically by the instanton - dyons .",
    "needless to say , there is a lot to be done .",
    "the instanton - dyons were identified on the lattice , see e.g. @xcite and references therein , but the information about their density at various temperatures remains sketchy .",
    "certain predictions made in @xcite need to be checked .",
    "intriguing generalizations to more fermion types , different fermion boundary conditions or quantum numbers can be worked out rather straightforwardly .",
