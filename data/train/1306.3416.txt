    "network science has attracted much attention in recent years due to its interdisciplinary applications @xcite .",
    "many network results have been obtained by analyzing isolated networks , but most real - world networks do in fact interact with and depend on other networks @xcite .",
    "thus , in analogy to the ideal gas laws that are valid only in the limiting case that molecules do not interact , so the extensive results for the case of non - interacting networks hold only when it is justified to neglect the interactions between networks .",
    "recently several studies have addressed the resilience as well as other properties of interacting networks @xcite .",
    "a framework based on percolation theory has been developed to analyze the cascading failures caused by interdependencies between two networks @xcite . in interdependent networks ,",
    "when nodes in one network fail they usually cause the failure of dependent nodes in other networks , and this in turn can cause further damage to the first network and result in cascading failures , which could lead to abrupt collapse of the system .",
    "later on , two important generalizations of the basic model @xcite have been developed .",
    "because in real - world scenarios the initial failure of important nodes ( `` hubs '' ) may not be random but targeted , a mathematical framework for understanding the robustness of interdependent networks under an initial targeted attack on specific degree of nodes has been studied by huang et al .",
    "@xcite and later extended by dong et al .",
    "also in real - world scenarios , the assumption that each node in network a depends on one and only one node in network b and vice versa may not be valid . to release this assumption , a theoretical framework for understanding the robustness of interdependent networks with a random number of support and dependency relationships has been developed and studied by shao et al.@xcite .",
    "more recently , gao et al . developed an analytical framework to study percolation of a tree - like network formed by @xmath0 interdependent networks @xcite .",
    "gao et al .",
    "found that while for @xmath3 the percolation transition is a second order , for any @xmath4 cascading failures occur and the network collapses as in a first order transition .",
    "indeed cascading failures have caused blackouts in interdependent communication and power grid systems spanning several countries @xcite . to be able to design resilient infrastructures or improve existing infrastructures we need to understand how venerability is affected by such interdependencies @xcite .",
    "here we generalize the theory of interdependent networks @xcite to regular and random regular ( rr ) network of @xmath0 interdependent networks that include loops .",
    "figures  [ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) illustrate such network of networks ( netonet ) , in which each network depends on the same number @xmath1 of other networks .",
    "we develop an exact analytical approach for percolation of a regular and a random regular netonet system composed of @xmath0 partially interdependent networks .",
    "we show that for an rr network with degree @xmath1 of @xmath0 interdependent networks where each network has the same degree distribution , same average degree @xmath5 and the fraction of dependence nodes between a pair of interdependent networks , @xmath2 , is the same for all pairs , the number of networks is irrelevant .",
    "we obtain analytically the fraction of survived nodes in each network after cascading failures , @xmath6 as a function of @xmath7 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",

    "we assume that after an attack or failure only a fraction of nodes @xmath13 in each network @xmath8 remains .",
    "we also assume that only nodes that belong to a giant component in each network @xmath8 will remain functional .",
    "when a cascade of failures occurs , nodes in network @xmath8 that do not belong to the giant component in network @xmath8 fail and cause nodes in other networks that depend on them to also fail .",
    "when those nodes fail , dependent nodes and isolated nodes in the other networks also fail , and the cascade can cause further failures back in network @xmath8 . in order to determine the fraction of nodes @xmath14 in each network that remains functional ( i.e. , the fraction of nodes that constitutes the giant component ) after the cascade of failures as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath15 , we need to analyze the dynamics of the cascading failures .",
    "we assume that all @xmath10 nodes in network @xmath8 are randomly assigned a degree @xmath16 from a probability distribution @xmath17 , they are randomly connected , and the only constraint is that a node with degree @xmath16 has exactly @xmath16 links @xcite .",

    "it is easy to see    @xmath205    and the equal condition is satisfied only when @xmath189 , so @xmath206 .",

    "we find that @xmath142 and @xmath94 exist , where a netonet shows a second - order transition when @xmath95 , a hybrid transition when @xmath101 , and that in all other cases there is no phase transition because all nodes in the netonet spontaneously collapse .",
    "thus the percolation theory of a single network is a limiting case of a more general case of percolation of interdependent networks .",
    "our results show that the percolation threshold and the giant component depend solely on the average degree of the er network and the degree of the rr network , but not on the number of networks .",
    "these findings enable us to study the percolation of different topologies of netonet .",
    "we expect this work to provide insights leading to further analysis of real data on interdependent networks .",
    "the benchmark models we present here can be used to study the structural , functional , and robustness properties of interdependent networks . because , in real netonets , individual networks are not randomly connected and their interdependent nodes are not selected at random , it is crucial that we understand many types of correlations existing in real - world systems and to further develop the theoretical tools studying all of them .",
    "future studies of interdependent networks will need to focus on ( i ) an analysis of real data from many different interdependent systems and ( ii ) the development of mathematical tools for studying the vulnerability of real - world interdependent systems .",
