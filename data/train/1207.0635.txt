    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have become an important complement to experimental and theoretical work across a variety of disciplines",
    ". often , one of the encountered obstacles to further advances are the prohibitive computational resources necessary for a description at the molecular level of systems containing a large number of particles @xcite .",
    "this situation is in general quite common when water is involved as solvent .",
    "one way to overcome this limitation is to reduce the degrees of freedom to the essential for the issues under investigation .",
    "this procedure is referred to as coarse - graining because the system is suitably organized into units identifying groups of atoms . to achieve this , two schemes are basically available @xcite .",
    "the differences mainly reside in the decomposition of the system into building blocks and the selected properties according to which inter - particle interactions are calibrated .",
    "our work is based on the martini force field because allowing to build readily and systematically systems of coarse - grained ( cg ) units in a prescribed way @xcite . within this framework four",
    "heavy atoms are generally mapped into one interaction site .",
    "the resulting beads are classified into four main categories that separate further into subtypes .",
    "lennard - jones ( lj ) interactions are organized into ten levels of strength and evaluated with a function of type @xmath3-@xmath4 . in its original formulation , the martini model does not contemplate solid phases @xcite . following empirical arguments , we treat graphitic surfaces and their wetting properties by surfactant solutions . in that respect ,",
    "the surface tension of water is of course a key property . the polarizable martini model for water @xcite still underestimates the experimental value .",
    "the expected balance of forces at the interface with the graphitic surface is approximately restored by tuning the interaction strength of the relative lj potential . in this way",
    ", we first reproduce in the macroscopic limit the contact angle for pure water from measurements at present carried out under the most ideal conditions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our results correlate well with those using atomistic models for water consistent with the experimental surface tension @xcite .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the martini force field can provide an effective framework for investigating the wetting properties of surfaces .",
    "surfactants are molecules exhibiting opposite behavior toward water at their extremes , namely hydrophilic in the headgroup and hydrophobic in the tail group .",
    "importantly , these competing attributes are responsible for the decrease of the surface tension of the resulting solution @xcite . in practice",
    ", this means that an aqueous solution would wet better a surface with the addition of surfactants . at higher concentrations ,",
    "another important property related to the amphiphilic nature of surfactants is their ability to self - assemble into micelles @xcite .",
    "applications in the industry are innumerable , including printing , detergency , oil recovery , dispersion , emulsification , disinfection , etc .",
    "@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we concentrate on solutions with non - ionic surfactants .",
    "as conveyed by the title , emphasis is put on the wetting properties by measuring the contact angle of droplets .",
    "the identity of the surfactants under investigation is confidential for industrial reasons .",
    "specifically , their use as wetting agents is necessary for the optimal dispersion of reinforcement fillers in polymeric matrices ( low chemical compatibility to each other ) @xcite .",
    "this phase is rather promiment in the manufacturing route of composite materials in order to meet challenging , target properties @xcite .",
    "our work aims at providing useful guidance for planning applications .",
    "so , the basic mechanisms governing wetting phenomena by aqueous surfactant solutions are at the center of our attention .",
    "the strategy consists in simulating six representative surfactants differing in simple attributes such as the length of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups or the topology ( linear and t - shaped ) .",
    "our research develops as follows . in the next section , the martini representation of all the constituents of the systems",
    "is introduced .",

    "the settings used for cylindrical droplets of pure water are maintained .",
    "the effect of the presence of surfactants is to lower the contact angle and this is possible if the tail beads , displaying hydrophobic behavior , interact more strongly with the cg graphene than the head beads p@xmath54 .",

    "fig : drp_surf ] . in this way , the solution is not yet properly equilibrated , but more surfactant molecules are closer to the expected configuration , that is , near the contact line @xcite . at @xmath97 wt@xmath1 , all the systems still do not experience any influence of the presence of surfactants ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : contact_line ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , in similar studies @xcite , low surfactant concentrations resulted in a transient increase of the surface tension for the martini model . on the other hand ,",
    "the concentration around @xmath98 wt@xmath1 provides a basis of comparison among the different systems .",
    "the results for linear surfactants prove that , in first approximation , the dominant factors promoting wetting are the length and apolarity of the hydrophobic tail .",
    "indeed , comparison between surfactants l2 and l3 indicate that one single c@xmath55 bead is sufficient to counteract the effect of ten p@xmath54 beads ( their contact angles differ by a few degrees ) .",
    "we want to highlight the preferred arrangement of surfactant molecules inside the droplets . to this end , it is useful to look at the spatial distributions @xmath99 and @xmath100 for c@xmath55 beads along the @xmath101 and @xmath102 axes , as the notation suggests . here",
    "@xmath103 is the coordinate of the center of mass of cg water . as evidenced by fig .",
    "[ fig : droplet_surf ] , linear surfactant molecules are principally located at the solid - liquid interface .",
    "their organization is not uniform , as indicated by the statistics for micelles of tab .",
    "[ tab : contact_line ] . the weak tendency to form layers , together with the fact that the distribution @xmath104 is strongly peaked around the contact line , give further support to the hypothesis that the number of hydrophobic units is the dominant factor for enhanced wetting . regarding the t - shaped topology , from fig .",
    "[ fig : tshaped ] it is seen that less surfactant molecules accumulate along the contact line .",
    "the fact that the contact angle remains almost unchanged , as compared to the linear counterparts ( see tab .  [ tab : contact_line ] ) , let us conclude that their action is more effective . in macroscopic systems , they should thus wet better than linear surfactants , since the plateau in fig .",
    "[ fig : tshaped ] is already almost at the same height of the peaks near the contact line .",
    "interestingly , a longer hydrophobic tail does not lead to a lower contact angle .",
    "it thus arises that for t - shaped surfactants a shorter hydrophilic headgroup can enhance wetting more than a longer tail .",
    "the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : spreading ] shows that one advantage of the t - shaped topology is faster spreading .",
    "after @xmath105 [ ns ] of dynamics , the contact angles for t - shaped surfactants vary at most of @xmath106 ( surfactant t2 at @xmath107 wt@xmath1 ) . in the same evolution period , with the exception of the surfactant l2 at @xmath107 wt@xmath1 , the variations of the contact angle for linear surfactants are more marked : at least of @xmath108 ( surfactant l1 at @xmath109 wt@xmath1 ) and at most of @xmath110 ( surfactant l2 at @xmath111 wt@xmath1 ) .",
    "the influence of the topology for enhanced spreading was already recognized in the literature @xcite .",
    "small concentrations of surfactants around @xmath97 wt@xmath1 can cause significant reductions of the contact angle . as an example , for the surfactant triton^^ x-100 , the surface tension of water of @xmath112 [ mn / m ] decreases linearly with concentration up to @xmath113 wt@xmath1 , when the minimum of @xmath114 [ mn / m ] is attained ; for higher concentrations the surface tension remains of course constant .",
    "it turns out that the proper treatment of wetting phenomena by aqueous surfactant solutions requires conditions of difficult realization by the present computational capabilities .",
    "coarse - grained models allowed us to move one step further toward a more realistic representation of such systems in terms of surfactant concentrations . at the typical experimental concentration of @xmath97 wt@xmath1 , the coarse - grained martini force field @xcite marks no difference between the surfactants investigated here .",
    "for higher concentrations there appears that it is possible to discriminate the wetting behavior of the various surfactants .",
    "the main instrumental conclusion of our study is that the length and apolarity of the hydrophobic tail determine to a larger extent the wetting behavior for the linear topology .",
    "instead , the length of the hydrophilic headgroup appears to be more relevant for the t - shaped topology . in the framework of our simulations ,",
    "the t - shaped topology does not lead to a substantial decrease of contact angle vis - a - vis linear surfactants .",
    "lennard - jones forces are short range and the reduction of the contact angle is essentially driven by the accumulation of surfactants along the contact line .",
    "micelle statistics demonstrates that linear surfactants pack more tightly , compensating the fact that the hydrophobic tail beads of t - shaped surfactants are on average closer to the graphitic substrate .",
    "it thus follows that the stronger self - assembly behavior of surfactants can also favor wetting . on the other hand",
    ", the weaker micellization of t - shaped surfactants can result in faster spreading .",
    "finally , our parameterization of surfactants while very simple can encompass and provide benchmarks for several commercially available surfactants .",
    "more comparative work remains to be done and our results offer some insight on the complex interplay between micellization , spreading and wetting .",
    "this work was supported by the swiss innovation promotion agency ( kti / cti ) through bipcanp project under grant p.  no .",
    "computations were done with the facilities of cscs and icimsi - supsi .",
