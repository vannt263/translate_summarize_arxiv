    "in the swift era @xcite , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) observation @xcite provides the complete light curves of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in the 0.2 - 10 kev band .",
    "one of the most interesting discoveries is the so - called shallow decay segment : the flux plateau of @xmath0 within @xmath1 second after the trigger @xcite .",
    "recent statistic analyses @xcite have revealed that the phase of shallow decay in the x - ray afterglow might be a common feature of the long grbs .",
    "the shallow decay in the early x - ray light curve is still a mystery , although theoretical explanations have been put forward from several aspects ( see zhang 2007 for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "most of the models are : hydrodynamics of the shock by energy injection @xcite , geometry of the jet @xcite , varying microphysical parameters @xcite , late prompt emission @xcite or up - scattered forward - shock emission @xcite .    from the point of microphysics in the hydrodynamic evolution , the nature of coupling between the electrons , protons and magnetic field is complex @xcite .",
    "usually the simple way is to assume the equipartition between electrons , protons and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "however , in this letter , we propose that the kinetic energy of the relativistic shocks in the plasma has been converted to the internal energy as three parts : ( 1 ) @xmath2 , which is the energy of magnetic field ; ( 2 ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 , it means that the electrons and protons / positrons are accelerated by the shocks , normally , this is the process of first - order fermi acceleration ; ( 3 ) @xmath5 , which presents the turbulent energy , and this energy would sustain a relatively long time ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the last part has not been taken into account by the former research . in our novel scenario ,",
    "the relativistic electrons accelerated by the first - order fermi acceleration emit the gamma - ray by synchrotron radiation , after the decrease of the prompt emission tail which is shown as the deep decay in the early x - ray light curve , indicating that the internal shocks are abated , the follow - up turbulence and its effects might be dominated .",
    "the turbulence could transfer its energy to the electrons via second - order fermi acceleration , which is also called as the stochastic acceleration .",
    "therefore , in this turbulent region , due to the resonant interaction between electrons and plasma waves , the electrons buried in the magnetic field are re - accelerated by the stochastic acceleration .",
    "the emission of these electrons dominates the shallow decay phase , until the turbulent energy dissipates and the external shock sweeps the surround medium thus the deep decay appears again .    in section 2 ,",
    "we review the fokker - planck equation and list the coefficients associated with the turbulent term . in section 3 , the turbulent parameter @xmath5 , as same as @xmath3 and @xmath2 ,",
    "is introduced . due to the turbulence , these microphysical parameters evolved with time are constrained by the process of stochastic acceleration .",
    "finally , we select these relations to reproduce the feature of shallow decay .",
    "the discussions are given in section 4 .",
    "the stochastic acceleration was suggested as an non - neglected mechanism to produce the high energy particles in grbs @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation has confirmed that the stochastic acceleration in the relativistic shocks plays an important role on the particle energy distribution and evolution @xcite .    in general , the charge particles are expected to be accelerated through resonant interactions with the magnetized plasma waves . for this stochastic acceleration",
    ", particle distribution function @xmath6 satisfies the fokker - planck equation , which is the kinetic equation of single electron in the energy space : @xmath7-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\gamma}[a(\\gamma)+ \\dot{e}_l f(\\gamma , t)]- \\frac{f(\\gamma , t)}{t(\\gamma)}+q(\\gamma , t)\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the acceleration rate , @xmath9 the diffusion rate , @xmath10 energy loss rate , @xmath11 the mean escape time of electrons and @xmath12 the source term .",
    "the turbulent spectrum is usually employed by the form of kolmogorov or kraichnan as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "@xcite already explored the various analytic solutions and they illustrated that the coefficients of the equation are related to the microphysics of turbulent plasma . in that paper",
    ", they offered one special example , the so - called hard - sphere approximation , where the index of turbulent spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "this detailed work has been complemented by @xcite , in which the time - dependent green s function was reexamined and the case of @xmath15 was considered .",
    "however , the energy loss , such as synchrotron or inverse compton , was not included in the solution .",
    "@xcite calculated the equation which is applied in the spectral variability of blazars .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the stochastic acceleration in sagittarius a * adopting @xmath14 . under the physical conditions of sagittarius a * , the steady state of @xmath16 was derived @xcite .",
    "@xcite have obtained the time dependent solution of @xmath16 taking into account the cooling via synchrotron and inverse compton radiation . in this letter ,",
    "the calculation is simply on the coefficients and we avoid to give any details about @xmath16 .    in order to explain the shallow decay phase of grb x - ray afterglow , assuming ( i ) the scatter path is much less then the length of the turbulent region , ( ii ) there is no continual injection and the accelerated electrons have the synchrotron cooling thus the steady state exists , we have the simplified fokker - planck equation of @xmath17 and all the coefficients are time - independent . here , we repeat the formulae produced by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the lorentz factor of electron , @xmath24 the wavenumber , @xmath25 the nonrelativistic larmor radius of the electron , @xmath26 the thomson cross section , * p * dimensionless momentum .",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the magnetic energy density , turbulent energy density , and photon field energy density respectively .",
    "suppose the the particles are accelerated by alfvn turbulence , the group speed @xmath30 is equal to alfvn speed .    in the traditional models , two microphysical parameters ,",
    "the ratio of magnetic field energy to the total internal energy @xmath31 and the fraction of the total internal energy that goes into the random motions of electrons @xmath32 , are drawn into the study of grbs @xcite . in our scenario ,",
    "the turbulent energy is included in the total internal energy .",
    "similar to the @xmath3 and @xmath2 , we define the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 to present the turbulent property as : @xmath33    since the dominant emission is synchrotron radiation during the shallow decay phase , the term of photon field @xmath29 which is associated with the inverse compton process can be ignored . of the single electron ,",
    "the stochastic acceleration rate is balanced to the energy loss rate through synchrotron radiation : @xmath34    the energy ratio of accelerated electrons in the turbulent region is equal to the total stochastic acceleration rate : @xmath35    the dissipation timescale of turbulent energy can be estimated by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "the relativistic electrons re - accelerated by stochastic acceleration are assumed to have energy distribution @xmath38 with the limits of @xmath39 $ ] and produce x - ray emission . for @xmath40 , the timescale @xmath41 is given by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath44 is the minimum lorentz factor of the accelerated electron by turbulence and @xmath45 is the number density of shocked medium .",
    "the dissipation timescale of the turbulent energy is coincident with the observational timescale of shallow decay phase .",
    "therefore , in the shocked region with turbulence , the evolution of microphysical parameters @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 can be derived from the coefficients of fokker - planck equation . from equation ( 7 ) and",
    "( 8) , we obtain : @xmath46 and @xmath47    furthermore , in this turbulent region , we assume that these microphysical parameters have the forms of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we insert them into equation ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) and put the constraints on a , b and d by two algebra equations : @xmath51 and @xmath52 we choose the turbulent spectrum of kraichnan with the index @xmath53 .",
    "all of the possible values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are shown in figure 1 , 2 and 3 .    from the standard afterglow model ,",
    "the fluxes in the early x - ray band were written by @xcite .",
    "there are two different limits : adiabatic and radiative case . for explanation of the emission in shallow decay phase",
    ", we obtain the early x - ray light curve under the adiabatic case as : @xmath57 as an example , we adopt the index @xmath53 and @xmath40 .",
    "four evolutionary fluxes are achieved in the table  [ tbl-1 ] , they are corresponding to the minimum and maximum values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 . while for the radiative case",
    ", the x - ray flux is : @xmath58 table  [ tbl-2 ] lists the possible fluxes evolved with the time .",
    "due to the turbulent energy and its dissipation in the shocked region , after the gamma - ray radiation , the electrons are re - accelerated by the stochastic acceleration and emit the early x - ray fluxes .",
    "therefore , the energy injection in the central engine is not required to reproduce the emission in the shallow decay phase .",
    "our results manifest that the temporal feature in the shallow decay phase represents the process of turbulent dissipation .",
    "the microphysical parameters , @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 , are varied with the time in the shocked region .",
    "given the special values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the adiabatic case , our calculation can represent the typical observational flux as @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , it is noted that the same shallow decay phase is also detected in the optical band as well @xcite , our simple interpretation is that the synchrotron emission of x - ray band and optical band may be original from the same shocked region with turbulent energy .",
    "another advantage of our model is that the crisis of radiative efficiency @xcite is therefore dispelled without any additional assumption of ejection / ejecta from the central engine . from this point of view",
    ", we support the internal shock pattern of standard fireball model .    in this work , we assume @xmath38 where @xmath40 as the typical value . the detailed calculation of the energy distribution @xmath16 is not needed , because in our scenario the timescale of acceleration is much smaller than that of turbulent energy dissipation . since the timescale of acceleration is also smaller than that of shock hydrodynamics , therefore , during the phase of shallow decay , the index of spectrum does not change @xcite .    generally , the varied values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 lead to the different hydrodynamic evolution and emissions in the entire afterglow @xcite . in this letter ,",
    "the early x - ray fluxes in the shallow decay phase are estimated either in the adiabatic or radiative case through the turbulent process .",
    "the average slope of radiative case is deeper than that of adiabatic case .",
    "compared with the xrt observation , the hydrodynamic evolution of adiabatic case could be the realized regime during the shallow decay phase .",
    "although it is hard to obtain the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 in our scenario , we put the constraints of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "more observational samples are particularly requested for the further investigations .",
    "we thank the staff of swift group in astronomico di brera ( merate ) , g. ghisellini and z. g. dai for the general discussion .",
