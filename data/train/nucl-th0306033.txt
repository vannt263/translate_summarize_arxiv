    "the recent experiments at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( tjnaf ) @xcite , graal of grenoble @xcite , and leps of spring-8 @xcite are expected to provide new opportunities for studying the electromagnetic production of vector mesons at low energies .",
    "for example , the differential cross section data for @xmath2 photoproduction from the clas collaboration at tjnaf show big differences with the old data of 1970 s @xcite in the large momentum - transfer ( @xmath9 ) region at low energies , where one may learn about the @xmath12 couplings and other production mechanisms @xcite .",
    "much more new data with similar high precisions will soon be available .",
    "the study of vector meson photoproduction is expected to shed light on the resolution of the so - called ` missing resonance ' problem @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that this can be achieved only when the nonresonant mechanisms are well understood @xcite . as a continuation of our effort in this direction @xcite , we explore in this work the nonresonant mechanisms of @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "there exist some investigations of the nonresonant mechanisms for vector meson photoproduction . to account for the diffractive features of the data in small @xmath13 region at high energies , the pomeron exchange model , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1](a ) , was developed .",
    "however , this model fails to describe the experimental observables at low energies .",
    "indeed , meson exchanges ( or secondary reggeon exchanges ) are found to be crucial in understanding the low energy data . in the case of @xmath14 photoproduction",
    ", it is well known that one - pion exchange is the most dominant process at low energies . for @xmath2 photoproduction , however , the situation is not clear . generally , there are two scenarios which are based on either the @xmath0 meson exchange model @xcite or the @xmath1 exchange model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 exchange model was motivated @xcite by the observation that the decay width of @xmath15 is much larger than the other radiative decays of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "it is further assumed that the @xmath16 in the @xmath17 channel can be modeled as a @xmath0 meson so that the @xmath18 vertex can be defined and modeled for calculating the @xmath0 exchange mechanism as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho1](b ) . in practice",
    ", the product of the coupling constants @xmath19 of this tree - diagram is adjusted to fit the cross section data of @xmath2 photoproduction at low energies .",
    "if we use @xmath20 from bonn potential @xcite , we then find that the resulting @xmath21 will yield a decay width of @xmath22 an order of magnitude larger than the value extracted from the recent experimental decay width of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus the dynamical interpretation of the commonly used @xmath0 meson exchange model for @xmath2 meson photoproduction must be further examined theoretically .    in this work",
    ", we would like to take a different approach to account for the exchange of @xmath16 in @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "first , the commonly employed @xmath0-exchange amplitude is _ revised _ by using the coupling constant @xmath24 from bonn potential and @xmath21 from the recent experimental decay width of @xmath25 with the assumption @xcite that @xmath26 in this decay is strongly correlated and can be approximated as a @xmath0 particle .",
    "this is our starting point of developing a new model which is more consistent with the existing meson - exchange models for @xmath27 scattering @xcite , @xmath7 scattering , and pion photoproduction @xcite .",
    "we then consider the consequence of the strong @xmath28 decay which accounts for almost the entire decay width of the @xmath2 meson .",
    "with the empirical value of the @xmath2 meson decay width , one can define the @xmath29 vertex , which then leads naturally to the ` uncorrelated ' two - pion exchange mechanism illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pi ] with @xmath30 in the intermediate state . a more complete calculation of un - correlated @xmath6-exchange contributions to @xmath2 photoproduction should also include other intermediate states such as @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "however , the contributions from these intermediate states involve propagation of two or three pions and must be considered along with other multi - pion exchange mechanisms ( such as the crossed diagrams due to the interchange of @xmath33 and @xmath2 lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pi ] ) . obviously , this is a much more complex task and will not be attempted in this exploratory investigation .",
    "our calculation of @xmath6-exchange will be detailed in section  ii.f .",
    "the @xmath1 exchange model for @xmath2 photoproduction was motivated by the results from the analyses of @xmath34 scattering data at low energies @xcite . in the study of",
    "@xmath34 scattering the dominant secondary regge trajectory is represented by the @xmath5 trajectory , and the idea of pomeron-@xmath5 proportionality had been used to model the pomeron couplings using the @xmath1 couplings until 1970 s @xcite before the advent of the soft pomeron model by donnachie and landshoff @xcite . by considering the role of the @xmath5 trajectory in @xmath34 scattering ,",
    "it is natural to consider the @xmath1 exchange model for vector meson photoproduction .",
    "however , the @xmath1 exchange model developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath2 photoproduction made use of the pomeron-@xmath5 proportionality in the reverse direction .",
    "namely , they assume that the structure of the @xmath1 couplings are the same as that of the soft pomeron exchange model .",
    "thus the @xmath1 tensor meson was treated as a @xmath35 isoscalar photon , i.e. , a vector particle .",
    "in addition , the fit to the data is achieved by introducing an additional adjustable parameter to control the strength of the @xmath1 coupling @xcite .",
    "this is obviously not very satisfactory and leaves a room for improvement .    instead of relying on the pomeron-@xmath5 proportionality assumption",
    ", the @xmath1 meson exchange amplitude is evaluated in this work starting with an effective lagrangian which is constructed from the tensor structure of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "phenomenological information together with tensor meson dominance and vector meson dominance assumptions are used to estimate the @xmath1 coupling constants . with this",
    ", we then explore the extend to which the @xmath2 photoproduction data can be described by a model that includes this newly constructed @xmath1 exchange amplitude together with the revised @xmath0-exchange amplitude and the un - correlated @xmath6-exchange amplitudes discussed above .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we explicitly define the amplitudes for the considered @xmath2 photoproduction mechanisms , including the pomeron exchange , @xmath0 exchange , pseudoscalar meson exchanges , @xmath36- and @xmath37-channel nucleon terms , and the newly constructed @xmath1 exchange .",
    "the @xmath6 exchange amplitudes are then given to complete our model construction .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section iii . for comparison , we consider two models .",
    "both models contain the @xmath36- and @xmath37-channel nucleon terms and the exchanges of pomeron , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , the first model includes the @xmath0 exchange with free parameters to fit the data following refs .",
    "@xcite , while the second model contains the two - pion , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 exchanges , where the parameters of the @xmath0 exchange are fixed by bonn potential and @xmath40 decay .",
    "we explore the extent to which these two rather different models can be distinguished by examining the differential cross sections and spin asymmetries .",
    "section iv contains a summary and discussions .",
    "the details on the @xmath1 interactions with the photon and hadrons are given in appendix for completeness .",

    "[ fig : rho1](a ) . in this process",
    ", the incoming photon first converts into a @xmath53 pair , which interacts with the nucleon by the pomeron exchange before forming the outgoing vector meson .",
    "the quark - pomeron vertex is obtained by the pomeron - photon analogy @xcite , which treats the pomeron as a @xmath35 isoscalar photon , as suggested by a study of nonperturbative two - gluon exchanges @xcite .",

    "for @xmath2 photoproduction , we set @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath0 meson exchange model advocated by friman and soyeur @xcite is based on the observation that @xmath77 is the largest among all @xmath2 meson radiative decays , which leads to the assumption that the @xmath2 photoproduction process at low energies is dominated by the exchange of @xmath6 .",

    "the cutoff parameters of the form factors and the product of coupling constants @xmath19 are adjusted to fit the @xmath2 photoproduction data at low energies .",
    "it was found @xcite that @xmath84 the resulting @xmath0 mass parameter is close to the value @xmath85 gev of bonn potential @xcite .",
    "if we further take the value @xmath86 from bonn potential , we then find that the resulting @xmath21 is close to the values from the qcd sum rules , @xmath87 @xcite or @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "however such a large value of @xmath89 corresponds to the @xmath90 decay width that is much larger than the empirical value of @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "if we accept the empirically estimated , but model - dependent value of snd experiment @xcite , @xmath92 , which gives @xmath93 kev , we get @xmath94 since the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag - sigma ] ) gives @xmath95 this value is smaller than that of eq .",

    "therefore , the @xmath0 exchange model suffers from the big uncertainty of @xmath21 , which is under debate @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is no clear particle identification of a @xmath0 particle and the use of @xmath0 exchange in defining @xmath27 potential has been seriously questioned .",

    "thus we find that model ( b ) is comparable to model ( a ) that is the commonly used @xmath0 exchange model in fitting the differential cross section data of slac and tjnaf .",
    "in particular , the data at small @xmath9 ( @xmath216 gev@xmath11 ) can be equally well described by both models , as more clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdt ] , where the full calculations of two models are compared . on the other hand",
    ", both models can not fit the data at large @xmath9 ( @xmath217 gev@xmath11 ) .",
    "but this is expected since we have not included @xmath218 and @xmath219 excitation mechanisms which were found @xcite to give significant contributions to @xmath14 photoproduction at large @xmath9 .",
    "however , we will not address this rather non - trivial issue here .",
    "the main difficulty here is that most of the resonance parameters associated with isospin @xmath220 @xmath219 resonances , which do not contribute to @xmath14 photoproduction , are not determined by particle data group or well - constrained by theoretical models .",
    "before we use our model to determine a large number of resonance parameters by fitting the existing limited data , it would be more desirable to further test and improve the nonresonant amplitudes such as including more complete calculations of @xmath6-exchanges .",
    "hence , in this paper , we focus on exploring which experimental observables are useful for distinguishing more clearly the model ( b ) from model ( a ) in the small @xmath9 ( @xmath216 gev@xmath11 ) region where both models can describe the differential cross section data to a large extent and the @xmath218 and @xmath219 effects are expected to be not important .",
    "experimental verifications of our prediction in this limited @xmath13 region will be useful for understanding the non - resonant amplitudes of @xmath2 photoproduction at low energies .",
    "we have explored the consequences of the constructed models ( a ) and ( b ) in predicting the spin asymmetries , which are defined , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the results for the single spin asymmetries are shown in fig .",

    "clearly the single spin asymmetries including the target asymmetry @xmath222 , the recoiled proton asymmetry @xmath223 , and the tensor asymmetry @xmath224 of the produced @xmath2 meson would be useful to distinguish the two models and could be measured at the current experimental facilities .",
    "of course our predictions are valid mainly in the small @xmath13 region since the @xmath218 and @xmath219 excitations @xcite or @xmath225-pole contributions @xcite , which are expected to be important at large @xmath13 , are not included in this calculation .",

    "[ fig:3.55-pols ] and [ fig:3.55-pol - dble ] , therefore , will be useful in understanding the non - resonant mechanisms of @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "since both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 exchanges are natural parity exchanges , it would be difficult to test them using parity asymmetry or photon asymmetry that can be measured from the decay distribution of the @xmath2 meson produced by polarized photon beam . for completeness , we give the predictions of the two models on these asymmetries in fig .",
    "[ fig:3.55-pol - decay ] .",
    "as expected , it is very hard to distinguish the two models in the forward scattering angles with these asymmetries .",
    "in this paper we have re - examined the @xmath0-exchange and @xmath1-exchange mechanisms of @xmath2 photoproduction reactions .",
    "it is found that the commonly employed @xmath0-exchange amplitude is weakened greatly if the @xmath0 coupling constants are evaluated by using the recent information about the @xmath3 decay and the @xmath4 coupling constant of bonn potential .",
    "this has led us to introduce the un - correlated @xmath6 exchange amplitude with @xmath7 intermediate state .",
    "this leading - order @xmath6 exchange amplitude can be calculated realistically using the coupling constants determined from the study of pion photoproduction and the empirical width of @xmath8 .    in the investigation of @xmath1-exchange mechanism",
    ", we evaluate its amplitude using an effective lagrangian which is constructed from the tensor structure of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "phenomenological information together with tensor meson dominance and vector meson dominance assumptions are used to estimate the @xmath1 coupling constants .",
    "this approach , which is more consistent with the conventional meson - exchange models , is rather different from the @xmath1-exchange model of laget @xcite , where the @xmath1 interaction structure was borrowed from that of pomeron exchange assuming pomeron-@xmath5 proportionality , i.e. , @xmath1-photon analogy .    in comparing with the existing differential cross section data , we find that a model with the constructed @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 exchanges is comparable to the commonly used @xmath0-exchange model in which the @xmath0 coupling parameters are simply adjusted to fit data .",
    "both models can describe the data equally well in the small @xmath9 ( @xmath226 gev@xmath11 ) region , but fail at large @xmath9 .",
    "we suggest that experimental verifications of the predicted single and double spin asymmetries in the small @xmath9 region will be useful for distinguishing two models and improving our understanding of the non - resonant amplitude of @xmath2 photoproduction .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the present investigation is just a very first step toward obtaining a complete dynamical exchange model of @xmath2 photoproduction at low energies .",
    "the next steps are to examine the additional @xmath6-exchange mechanisms due to , for example , @xmath31 and @xmath32 intermediate states and the crossed diagrams of fig .  [ fig:2pi ] .",
    "the effects due to @xmath218 and @xmath219 effects must be included for a realistic understanding of the interplay between the non - resonant and resonant amplitudes .",

    "<S> the @xmath0-exchange and @xmath1-exchange mechanisms for @xmath2 meson photoproduction are re - examined . </S>",
    "<S> then the commonly employed @xmath0-exchange amplitude is revised by using the recent information from the analyses on the @xmath3 decay and the @xmath4 coupling constant from bonn potential . instead of relying on the pomeron-@xmath5 proportionality assumption , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 meson exchange amplitude is established from an effective lagrangian which is constructed from the tensor structure of the @xmath1 meson . </S>",
    "<S> phenomenological information together with tensor meson dominance and vector meson dominance assumptions are used to estimate the @xmath1 coupling constants . as a first step to improve the current theoretical models , </S>",
    "<S> we have also explored the effects due to the un - correlated @xmath6 exchange amplitude with @xmath7 intermediate state . </S>",
    "<S> this leading - order @xmath6 exchange amplitude can be calculated using the coupling constants determined from the study of pion photoproduction and the empirical width of @xmath8 decay . in comparing with the existing differential cross section data , we find that a model with the constructed @xmath6 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 exchanges is comparable to the commonly used @xmath0 exchange model in which the @xmath0 coupling parameters are simply adjusted to fit the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that experimental verifications of the predicted single and double spin asymmetries in the small @xmath9 ( @xmath10 gev@xmath11 ) region will be useful for distinguishing the two models and improving our understanding of the non - resonant amplitude of @xmath2 photoproduction . </S>",
    "<S> possible further improvements of the model are discussed . </S>"
