    "a broad class of pattern - formation models in one- and multi - dimensional geometries is based on the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equations with the cubic - quintic ( cq ) nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "arguably , these models find the most important realization is lasing media , where the cq terms account for the combination of nonlinear gain and loss ( the cgl equation also includes the linear loss ) @xcite . in terms of actual laser systems , the cq nonlinearity represents configurations incorporating the usual linear amplifiers and saturable nonlinear absorbers . in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting , the cq cgl equation readily gives rise to stable solitary pulses ( dissipative solitons ) .",
    "these solutions and their physical implications have been studied in numerous works @xcite .",
    "a well - known problem is the search for stable dissipative solitons in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) version of cgl equations . in that case , the challenging factors are the possibility of the critical collapse induced by the cubic self - focusing term , and the vulnerability of vortex solitons , which are shaped as vortex rings , to azimuthal perturbations that tend to split them @xcite .",
    "actually , petviashvili and sergeev @xcite had originally introduced the cgl equation with the cq nonlinearity with the purpose to develop a model admitting stable localized 2d patterns .",
    "stable 2d solitary vortices ( alias spiral solitons ) , with topological charge ( vorticity ) @xmath0 and @xmath4 , were first reported in ref .",

    "the physical interpretation of all terms in eq . ( [ model ] ) is straightforward , except for the diffusion .",
    "this term arises in some models of large - aspect - ratio laser cavities , close to the lasing threshold .",
    "actually , such models are based on the complex swift - hohenberg equation  lega , which reduces to the cgl equation for long - wave excitations . in the usual situation ,",

    "the nonlinear finite - difference equations were solved using the picard iteration method , and the resulting linear system was handled by means of the gauss - seidel iterative procedure . to achieve good convergence , ten picard and five gauss - seidel iterations were needed .    in fig .",
    "12 we show an illustrative plot of the 2d periodic potential ( 3 ) with strength @xmath100 .",
    "the numerical simulations demonstrate that _ fully stable _ csvs may be indeed supported by the periodic potential ( 3 ) , see figs .",
    "13 and 14 .",
    "this result is significant , as no example of stable compact vortices , squeezed into a single cell of the supporting lattice , was earlier reported in 2d cgl models .",
    "a set of typical examples of stable craters is displayed in fig .",
    "13 , and the stability of such vortices ( in the form of the self - cleaning against random perturbations ) is illustrated by fig .",
    "further analysis ( not shown here ) demonstrate that the shape of the craters and their self - cleaning after the addition of random perturbations seem essentially the same if the diffusion term with a small coefficient @xmath11 is added ( which means that the grating s potential remains a stronger stabilizing factor than the weak diffusion , if any ) .    in fig .",
    "15 , the csv families with @xmath0 are represented , as before , by the corresponding @xmath146 curves , which are plotted in intervals of values of the cubic gain @xmath42 where the csvs are stable . for the sake of comparison , in fig .",
    "16 we display similar diagrams for the fundamental solitons ( @xmath1 ) in the same model . in figs .",
    "15 and 16 , we additionally display the stability domains found at a small nonzero value of the diffusion parameter , @xmath147 .",
    "the comparison demonstrates that the stability regions for both the fundamental solitons and compact vortices shift to larger values of @xmath42 at @xmath17 , which is natural , as a larger value of the cubic gain is needed to compensate the loss incurred by the diffusion term .",
    "stable csvs with vorticities @xmath2 have not been found in direct simulations of eq .",
    "( 2 ) with the periodic potential ; instead , families of robust compact square - shaped _",
    "quadrupoles _ , into which unstable vortices with @xmath2 are spontaneously transformed , were found at different values of the periodic - potential s strength , @xmath21 .",
    "a typical example of the transformation , for @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , is displayed in fig .",
    "the stability of the quadrupoles against random perturbations was tested in the same way as done above for the vortices with @xmath0 .",
    "the results are again summarized by means of the respective @xmath146 curves , which are displayed , both for @xmath18 and @xmath147 , in fig .",
    "18 . finally , in fig .",
    "19 we show typical examples of the amplitude and phase structure of compact square - shaped quadrupoles for @xmath18 , @xmath151 , and three different values of the strength of the periodic potential , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 .",
    "the major objective of this work was to build stable compact crater - shaped vortices , with topological charge @xmath0 , in the complex ginzburg - landau model which is relevant to modeling laser cavities , as it does not include the artificial diffusion term .",
    "instead , the stabilization of the compact vortices is provided by external potentials , which we took in two different forms : as the axisymmetric parabolic trap ( [ omega ] ) , and the periodic grating s potential ( [ grating ] ) . in the experiment",
    ", the effective axisymmetric potential can be realized by means of a simple focusing lens inserted into the cavity . in both cases , stability regions for the crater - shaped vortices have been identified .",
    "parallel to that , the stability regions of the fundamental solitons ( @xmath1 ) were also found , for the sake of the comparison . in the case of the axisymmetric potential , those crater - shaped vortices which are unstable split into robust _ dipoles_. all the vortices with @xmath2 are unstable , splitting into stable _ tripoles _ , that may freely rotate .",
    "the stability regions for the dipole and tripole modes were identified too . as concerns the periodic potential",
    ", it can not stabilize crater - shaped vortices with @xmath44 .",
    "instead , families of stable compact square - shaped quadrupoles were found to exist at different values of the strength of the periodic potential .",
    "a challenging extension suggested by the present work is to find stable compact solitons with embedded vorticity in the three - dimensional ( spatiotemporal ) version of the complex ginzburg - landau equation with the periodic potential .",
    "this possibility is especially interesting because this model does not support stable compound vortices @xcite .",
