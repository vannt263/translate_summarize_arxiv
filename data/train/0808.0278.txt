    "for many years spin ladder systems have attracted much attention .",
    "the fundamental properties are essentially understood when the open boundary conditions are applied in the rung direction .",
    "one of the overriding properties is that spin-@xmath0 ladders are gapful for an even number of legs and whereas gapless for an odd number of legs ( e.g. , as a review , see ref .",
    "however , it has been recognized that the spin states of odd - leg ladders are drastically changed by applying the periodic boundary conditions in the rung direction ( referred as a spin tube ) . at present , there are some experimental candidates for odd - leg spin tubes  @xcite . theoretically , it was suggested that all the spin excitations of three - leg heisenberg tube are gapped due to a frustration - induced spin - peierls transition  @xcite .",
    "although further several theoretical studies  @xcite have been carried out since then , the basic properties of odd - leg spin tube is a still open issue .",
    "[ lattice ]    in general , the low - energy physics of any odd - leg spin tube may be epitomized by that of the three - leg spin tube .",
    "therefore , we consider the three - leg antiferromagnetic heisenberg tube , the hamiltonian of which is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a spin-@xmath0 operator at rung @xmath3 and leg @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is the exchange interaction in the leg direction and @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) is the exchange interaction between the legs ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we take @xmath8 as the unit of energy hereafter .",
    "in this work we employ the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method which provides very accurate data for ground - state properties of one - dimensional quantum systems ; for a review , see refs .",
    "we use the dmrg method to calculate the spin gap @xmath9 and the dimerization order parameter @xmath10 .",
    "we study ladders with several kinds of length @xmath11 to @xmath12 with open - end boundary conditions in the leg direction .",
    "we keep up to @xmath13 density - matrix eigenstates in the renormalization procedure and extrapolate the calculated quantities to the limit @xmath14 . in this way ,",
    "the maximum truncation error , i.e. , the discarded weight , is less than @xmath15 , while the maximum error in the ground - state energy is less than @xmath16 .",
    "the spin gap is evaluated by an energy difference between the first triplet excited state and the singlet ground state , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the ground - state energy of a system of length @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 ladder , with @xmath21-component of the total spin @xmath22 .",
    "note that the number of system length must be taken as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being an integer to maintain the total spin of the ground state as @xmath25 .",
    "all values of the spin gap shown in this paper are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 .",
    "let us then define the dimerization order parameter . since the translational symmetry is broken due to the friedel oscillation under the application of the open - end boundary conditions , the dimerized state is directly observable .",
    "we are interested in the formation of alternating spin - singlet pairs in the leg direction , so that we calculate the nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlations , @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the ground - state expectation value .",
    "the results for all @xmath4 values are equivalent .",
    "it is generally known that the friedel oscillations at the center of the system decay as a function of the system length . if the amplitude at the center of the system persists for arbitrarily long system length ,",
    "there exists a long - ranged order .",
    "it corresponds to the spin - peierls dimerized ground state in our model .",
    "we thus define the dimerization order parameter as @xmath29 we confirmed that @xmath10 is almost saturated at @xmath30 in our previous paper  @xcite , so that in this paper it is calculated for a system with length @xmath31 .",
    "nonzero value of @xmath10 indicates a long - ranged spin - peierls state with finite spin gap .",
    "[ results ]      in figure 2 ( a ) , we show the dmrg results of the spin gap @xmath9 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain @xmath32 in the limit of @xmath33 .",
    "it is rather smaller than a value estimated in ref .  [ 3 ] because of the different finite - size - scaling analysis . roughly speaking",
    ", the spin gap increases proportionally to @xmath7 in the small @xmath7 ( @xmath34 ) regime and keeps almost constant in the large @xmath7 ( @xmath35 ) regime .",
    "this behavior can be interpreted in terms of different origin of the lowest singlet - triplet excitation for each the @xmath7 regime , although the mechanism of gap opening is invariant for the entire @xmath7 regime .",
    "thing is , the spin gap is approximately scaled by a binding energy of most weakly bounded spin - singlet pair in the system and it switches around @xmath36 . in other words ,",
    "most weakly bounded pairs are transferred from on - leg ones in the small @xmath7 region ( on - leg region ) to on - rung ones in the large @xmath7 region ( on - rung region ) [ in the inset of figure 2 ( a ) , we denote the two regions as i and ii , respectively ] .",
    "a more concrete description is given in the following paragraph .",
    "for @xmath37 , we can easily imagine that the on - rung spin - singlet pairs must be bounded more solidly than the on - leg ones .",
    "the spin gap is therefore scaled by the binding energy of an on - leg pair , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath9 is independent of @xmath7 and it is consistent with the constant behavior of @xmath9 with @xmath7 at @xmath39 . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation is somewhat different for @xmath40 : the bound state of the on - leg pairs is expected to be more solid than that of the on - rung ones .",
    "it is because that the system is strongly dimerized even with infinitesimally small @xmath7 .",
    "the dimerization strength develops abruptly at @xmath41 and increases rather slowly with increasing @xmath7 ( see below ) .",
    "thus , the spin gap is essentially scaled by the binding energy of an on - rung pair .",
    "in addition , we may assume that the binding energy of the on - rung pair is proportional to @xmath7 in the small @xmath7 regime , by analogy with that of the two - leg heisenberg system  @xcite . now therefore , the spin gap is scaled by @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath42 , which is consistent to a linear behavior of @xmath9 with @xmath7 at @xmath43 .",
    "note that the derivative @xmath44 is very small ( @xmath45 ) due to strong spin frustration among the intra - ring spins .",
    "consequently , a crossover between the constant @xmath9 region and the proportional @xmath9 region is seated not at @xmath46 but around @xmath36 .",
    "the existence of this crossover has also be confirmed by studying the @xmath7 dependence of the dynamical spin structure factor  @xcite .",
    "we plot the dmrg results of the dimerization order parameter @xmath10 as a function of @xmath7 in figure 2 ( b ) , where the system size is fixed at @xmath47 .",
    "we expect the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath10 to be similar to that of the spin gap @xmath9 because the binding energy of spin - singlet pairs would be scaled with the dimerization strength .",
    "it is true that the overall behavior seems to be similar to that of the spin gap .",
    "however , surprisingly , the dimerization order parameter is discontinuously enhanced when @xmath7 is switched on as contrasted with the linear increase of the spin gap .",
    "then , the dimerization order parameter goes through a minimum around @xmath48 and increases almost linearly from @xmath49 to @xmath50 . in the limit of @xmath51 , the dimerization order parameter",
    "is saturated to @xmath52 .",
    "we study three - leg antiferromagnetic heisenberg tube with the dmrg method .",
    "the spin gap and the dimerization order parameter are estimated as a function of the rung coupling .",
    "we suggest that the spin gap is scaled by the binding energy of the on - rung spin - singlet pair in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath43 ) ; whereas , it is scaled by the binding energy of the on - leg spin - singlet pair in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath39 ) . furthermore , we find that the dimerization order parameter is approximately proportional to the spin gap except when the rung coupling is very small",
