    "the holographic principle has inspired many ways of exploring different spacetime geometries .",
    "the basic idea of holography , that physics in a region of space can be described by the fundamental degrees of freedom on its boundary , was originally applied to the area of quantum gravity by t hooft @xcite and susskind @xcite , but it was maldacena @xcite who developed it into something more tangible : the ads / cft correspondence @xcite @xcite ( for a comprehensive review , see @xcite ) .",
    "maldacena s conjecture postulated that string theory with @xmath0 boundary conditions is equivalent to @xmath1 super yang - mills theory , and ads - type spacetimes have become the subject of much work over the past decade .",

    "* among others ) have examined how to extract information from behind the horizon of black holes using the boundary correlation functions of the cft . from the spacetime point of view",
    "this involves using geodesics ( both null and spacelike ) travelling from one boundary to another as probes .",
    "however , this focus on singularities leaves open the question as to how much of a non - singular spacetime can be recovered using geodesic probes .    what we aim to explore in this paper is how accurately and completely one can use the data contained within the boundary correlators to recover the bulk metric in a static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "we examine a variety of different scenarios , and rather than merely looking at whether a recovery of the metric is possible , we investigate the factors affecting its recovery in practice .",
    "we make use of the relation between null geodesic endpoints and singularities in the correlation functions of operators inserted on the boundary . in other words ,",
    "that the correlation function between any two points on the boundary which can be connected by a null geodesic path diverges .",
    "thus from the field theory we can identify , say , the set of endpoints of null probes which all originated from the same point on the boundary .",
    "this endpoint data can then be used to recover information about the bulk metric .    in this paper",
    "we develop two methods for extracting this information , and the essence of both is that one can focus on specific radii by systematically using geodesics which penetrate to different depths in the bulk . for null geodesics",
    ", there is only one effective parameter which determines the minimum radius obtained by the geodesic in a given spacetime , namely the ratio of the angular momentum to the energy .",
    "when this ratio is close to one , the geodesic probe travels around the edge of the spacetime ; as it is reduced , the probe travels deeper into the spacetime before returning out to the boundary .",
    "what we discover is that in certain types of metric , the process of using null geodesic probes which penetrate to different depths can be used to recover the entire bulk metric in a remarkably simple manner .",
    "we begin in section 2 by briefly reviewing some background material on geodesics and their behaviour in a five dimensional ads spacetime .",
    "we observe that in this case , null geodesics always travel between antipodal points on the boundary , as shown in fig.[nullfig1 ] .",
    "in section 3 we move on to considering modified spacetimes which are still asymptotically ads . in these metrics ,",
    "null geodesics no longer necessarily terminate at their antipodal points after travelling through the bulk ; we are presented with a spectrum of endpoints , which provides the data we need to recover the metric .",
    "we discover that on a plot of the endpoints ( see fig.[modnullfig1 ] for an example ) , the gradient at any point is related to the ratio of the angular momentum and the energy of the corresponding null geodesic . using this relation together with the endpoint data",
    ", we devise a simple iterative method for extracting the bulk metric , beginning close to the boundary where the spacetime can be taken to be approximately ads . after considering whether this idea can also be applied in a more general scenario , we go on to develop a second method for iteratively recovering the metric .",
    "these two methods are analysed in more detail in section 4 , where we examine a number of issues arising from using them in practice .",
    "we propose several possible resolutions , in each case attempting to strike a balance between the accuracy of the recovered metric information and the computational effort required to do so .",
    "we then describe a modification to the second method which greatly improves the accuracy without a corresponding increase in computational effort .",
    "examples of the methods being used to recover the metric information in two different spacetimes are then given in section 5 , where the superiority of the modified second method becomes apparent ( see figures [ examp1]-[examp22 ] and the corresponding tables ) .    section 6 looks at limitations in the methods which arise not from the numerics but from the geometry of certain spacetimes we would like to consider .",
    "we examine how much of the bulk metric can be recovered in setups where the metric gives a non - monotonic effective potential for the geodesics , and where there is a singularity at the centre of the spacetime .    in section 7",
    "we discuss the results and mention possible extensions of the project , such as using the endpoint data of spacelike geodesics or considering non - static , non - spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "the metric for a five - dimensional anti - de sitter spacetime is often given in the form :    @xmath2    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the ads radius .    to calculate the geodesic paths , we first suppress two of the angular coordinates by setting the geodesics to lie in their equatorial plane . then from the form of the metric we can see the existence of two killing vectors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the remaining angular coordinate , which lead to two constraints on the motion .",

    "we can consider a small modification to the pure ads spacetime described by and , by replacing with :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is an analytic function which behaves as @xmath30 for small @xmath31 and @xmath32 for large @xmath31 , such that the metric is non - singular everywhere .",
    "behaviour of @xmath29 at small r ensures that we avoid a conical singularity at the origin . ]      in this modified spacetime , null geodesic paths do not always end at their antipodal point on the boundary ; their final @xmath33 and @xmath7 coordinates depend on the ratio of the angular momentum ( @xmath34 ) to the energy ( @xmath35 ) . from a physical point of view",
    "this can be thought of as the extra term @xmath29 representing an attractive modification to the centre of the spacetime , such that the geodesics follow a more curved path through the bulk , and thus `` overshoot '' the antipodal point .",

    "we note that for a fixed metric , the final time and angular coordinates will be functions of @xmath43 only , and so we can write :    @xmath44    @xmath45    if we define the function @xmath46 as :    @xmath47    and consider the derivative of and with respect to @xmath43 we have :    @xmath48    and @xmath49    comparing the integral terms in the two equations above , we see that they are identical upto a factor of @xmath43 .",

    "calculations along these lines are also not restricted to null geodesics , see @xcite for similar derivations involving spacelike ones . in the next section",

    "we set the ads radius ( @xmath4 ) to one , and by considering large enough @xmath62 such that the minimum radius , @xmath41 , corresponds to @xmath60 , becomes ( setting the initial time , @xmath63 , to be zero ) :    @xmath64    as we would expect , as geodesics remaining far from the centre of the space would not `` see '' the modification and thus behave as in pure ads . in this case",
    "we can solve the equation for the minimum radius :    @xmath65    to get @xmath60 in terms of @xmath66 , which is determined from the geodesic endpoints .",

    "this gives , to lowest order :    @xmath76    where we have used that @xmath77 and integrated .",
    "this can be simplified further by writing is kept small . ] :    @xmath78    thus we have : @xmath79 which can be used in conjunction with @xmath80 to calculate @xmath75 and @xmath81 , as we know @xmath82 and @xmath83 from the geodesic endpoints , and @xmath60 and @xmath84 have already been calculated .",
    "for general @xmath85 we split the integral into several pieces ; the two `` end '' integrals , which we evaluate as in and , and a series of integrals in the middle which can be evaluated using the trapezium rule or similar ( see fig.[traps1 ] ) .",

    "so far we have restricted ourselves to considering metrics of the form of , however , we can look to extend this further by considering the most general static , spherically symmetric spacetimes , given by metrics of the form :    @xmath91    where the @xmath92 coefficient is allowed to be different to the @xmath93 coefficient .",
    "equations and for the geodesics remain unchanged , and the third is now given by :    @xmath94    where @xmath95 for the null case .",
    "we can combine the equations together as before to give the integral equations :    @xmath96    @xmath97    the question now is whether we can use the two equations above along with the expression @xmath98 relating the parameter @xmath43 to the minimum radius to recover both @xmath55 and @xmath99 and thus reconstruct the bulk metric from the endpoints .",
    "this initially appears possible as we havent explicitly used our expression for @xmath7 , , in our method of the previous section . however",
    ", our observation that the gradient of the endpoints is given by the angular momentum suggests that we do nt have three linearly independent relations . attempting to continue as before , by approximating the spacetime as pure ads at some large radius and working inwards",
    ", the degeneracy soon becomes apparent ( see appendix c ) , and we are unable to recover bulk metric information in these more general spacetimes ( unless we _ a priori _ know the relationship between @xmath99 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "there is an alternative method for reconstructing @xmath55 in a spacetime of the form of which makes the degeneracy of the expressions for @xmath33 and @xmath7 more apparent .",
    "if we start from expression and integrate over @xmath43 we get :    @xmath100    which can be integrated by parts : @xmath101 and then rewritten using the expression for @xmath7 from :    @xmath102    we can now reverse the order of integration , and as the function @xmath55 has no dependence on @xmath43 , integrate over @xmath43 :    @xmath103    taking the initial conditions to be @xmath104 , we can say that for any endpoint @xmath105 on the boundary ,    @xmath106    where we have renamed the minimum @xmath31 as @xmath107 and used our definition for @xmath46 from before .",
    "this , coupled with the equation for the minimum @xmath31 ,    @xmath108    allows the metric function @xmath55 to be fully reconstructed from the plot of the endpoints , using a method of approximating the integral similar to that in section [ sec : method1 ] .",
    "whilst the previous methods both in principle allow the bulk metric to be fully recovered ( from @xmath84 down to @xmath109 , with @xmath60 arbitrarily large ) , there are a number of factors to take into account when performing the reconstruction in practice , in order to obtain a balance between accuracy and computational effort .",
    "consider a setup where we divide the range of @xmath43 into @xmath110 equal segments , with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , so that we have @xmath113 steps in the process of recovering @xmath55 ( note that the first step in the iteration uses @xmath114 rather than @xmath115 , as we want the first minimum radius to be finite ) .",
    "there are a number of issues with recovering @xmath55 in this scenario .",
    "we firstly observe that splitting @xmath43 up into equal segments means that the minimum radii will not be equally separated ; there will be a greater number of low radius points ( due to the shape of @xmath116 ) .",
    "this initially appears helpful , as we expect most of the bulk metric s deviation from pure ads to be localised close to the centre , and so a greater number of data points in this region should improve our estimate of @xmath55 .",
    "however , as both methods for recovering @xmath55 involve approximating integrals over @xmath31 , accuracy is only maintained if the step size is kept relatively small for all @xmath31 ; whilst starting with @xmath114 as close to one as possible allows @xmath55 to be recovered from as large a radius as possible ( as higher @xmath114 means higher @xmath117 ) , this also means the first few steps in @xmath31 will be unacceptably large .",
    "this can be countered by ensuring the number of steps is appropriately large , however , this will then result in a longer computational time .",
    "for example , in the asymptotically ads spacetime with @xmath55 given by    @xmath118    if use a step size in y of @xmath119 and take the initial @xmath114 to be @xmath120 , the corresponding minimum radius @xmath121 .",
    "the minimum radius corresponding to @xmath122 is only @xmath123 however , and such a large jump in the radius causes problems with using our approximation of the form of .",
    "whilst the original laurent expansion of is still fairly accurate over this distance , our approximation of the gradient by    @xmath124    is not .",
    "for the example above , the actual value of @xmath125 at @xmath126 is 44.5 , whereas the value given by is 53.8 ; a large discrepancy .",
    "we can still split the @xmath66 linearly ( in order to keep the majority of the points at low radii ) , however , we choose the initial @xmath114 to be be slightly lower .",
    "this enables our first step in the radius to be kept small . and",
    "@xmath127 for a given choice of initial @xmath114 ; if the difference @xmath128 is too great , either lower @xmath114 or increase @xmath129 until it s acceptable . ] in our example of , if we choose @xmath130 and keep the step size at @xmath119 , we find that @xmath131 which whilst still quite large , is much more acceptable than the value of @xmath132 we had previously .",
    "table [ table0 ] shows how this discrepancy in the gradient affects the extraction of @xmath55 by the method of section [ sec : method1 ] for the example of ; it is worth noting at this stage that even with the lower choice of starting @xmath43 the recovered estimate for @xmath55 is still quite poor with a step size of @xmath119 .",
    "this is important because although we could lower @xmath114 even further , we must keep our initial radius reasonably large ; if we choose @xmath114 to be too low , we risk having @xmath117 being too small , such that our assumption that the spacetime there is approximately that of pure ads is no longer valid . was too low , such that the metric was not approximately pure ads at this point , how would this be apparent from the extracted estimate of @xmath55 ?",
    "a simple solution is to check the behaviour of the estimate at @xmath31 close to @xmath117 ; if the function does not continue as @xmath133 ( i.e. pure ads ) down to say @xmath134 , then the chosen initial radius was too small .",
    "it is also worth noting that in a physical situation , one would naturally expect ordinary matter to remain within a radius of order of @xmath4 from the centre , due to the confining ads potential . ]",
    "we can keep our choice of @xmath114 high by reducing the step size ( as in the lower half of table [ table0 ] ) , but at the expense of additional computational time ( for more details on the numerical extraction see the examples in the next section ) .    .comparing the accuracy of using two different values for @xmath114 to recover the bulk metric information .",
    "the actual values for @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , which correspond to the three numerical factors in ( and are properly defined in ) , are given in brackets .",
    "more details on how these estimates were generated is given in section 5 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      given in table [ table4 ] ( i.e. produced using method ii ) , compared to the actual metric function @xmath55 from .",
    "only the estimates generated using the largest two step sizes are visibly distinguishable from the actual curve , as the the values of @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath11 are all quickly picked out using this alternative method.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=90.0% ] +    once again we see that the second method produces a much better estimate of @xmath55 than the first ; the difference in the accuracy is again significant .",
    "what is also noticeable in this slightly more complicated example is that the presence of a more prominent feature in the metric function ( in this case the small oscillation from the sine term ) can obscure the finer details of the spacetime .",
    "this is most obvious in the results from using method i ( see table [ table3 ] , where we can clearly see that whilst the numerical factors corresponding to the sine term ( @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath11 ) are easily determined even at a large step size , it then requires a smaller step size to pick out the @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 values than it did in the first example .",
    "whilst the second example has shown that the methods can be used for @xmath55 which have a significant deviation from pure ads near the centre , there remain problems in applying the methods in certain circumstances , which are examined in the next section .",
    "there are limitations in recovering @xmath55 all the way down to @xmath140 in the cases where the metric is non - singular but does not give a monotonic effective potential for the null geodesics , and also when there is a curvature singularity at @xmath56 .",
    "there is a problem with the method for reconstructing @xmath55 if the metric is such that for some critical value of the angular momentum , the null geodesics can go into an unstable orbit ( assuming fixed energy ) .",
    "this is indicated on the endpoint plot by the @xmath7 coordinate heading off to infinity , and the presence of a jump in the time taken by the geodesics with @xmath141 compared with those with @xmath142 , see fig.[mend2 ] for an example .",
    "the reason for these unstable orbits is because the effective potential for the metric is nt monotonic ; the orbits occur when the greatest radius ( @xmath143 say ) for which @xmath144 corresponds with that for which @xmath145 , see fig.[mv1 ] .",
    "this non - monotonicity also explains the time delay for those geodesics with angular momentum lower than @xmath146 , indicated by the gap between the asymptotes in fig.[mend2 ] : those with slightly lower @xmath34 have an effective potential of the form shown as the dashed blue curve in fig.[mv1 ] , and travel down to minimum radius @xmath147 , whereas those with @xmath148 have minimum radius greater than or equal to @xmath143 , indicated by the dashed red curve . the extra ( non - negligible ) distance @xmath149 travelled by the geodesics results in the time delay seen in the endpoints .    .",
    "the red lines indicate the limits to which the black curves tend as @xmath150,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "+     ( the solid black curve ) , one with @xmath141 ( the lowest curve , dashed blue ) , and one with @xmath151 ( top curve , dashed red).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ] +    we thus have the situation where we have no geodesics with minimum radius @xmath152 , where @xmath153 , and this is where our iterative methods break down .",
    "although we can begin by using one of the methods from earlier to recover @xmath55 down to @xmath154 , which corresponds to using the endpoints in the `` lower branch '' of fig.[mend2 ] , we can not continue past this point .",
    "using method i , say , the final term of the iteration will be :    @xmath155    with @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 defined as in section [ sec : method1 ] . as the next term would involve an integration over the range @xmath147 to @xmath143 , which can not necessarily be taken to be small , it can not be well approximated by the methods we have used previously .",
    "the gap between the upper and lower branches of fig.[mend2 ] tends to a constant time delay , @xmath159 , as @xmath160 , and it is this which corresponds to the integral we are unable to well approximate :    @xmath161    where we note that in the limit @xmath162 we have that @xmath163 .    we are left with the situation where we do not have enough information to carry on recovering @xmath55 past the rightmost maximum in the effective potential ; there is no approximation we could attempt to make without already knowing more about the form of @xmath116 .",
    "although we have the extra endpoint data ( i.e. the top branch of [ mend2 ] ) , we are unable to use it to extract f(r ) .",
    "having discovered this apparent limitation in the extraction of the bulk metric , we should ask ourselves how often we would expect to find metrics which give non - monotonic effective potentials for the null geodesics . in other words , how often do we find spacetimes which allow stable orbits of light rays ? whilst it is very easy to construct metrics by hand which allow this , in physical systems circular orbits of light rays are a rarity .",
    "indeed , recent work by hubeny _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite , indicates that for metrics corresponding to a gas of radiation in ads , it is impossible for circular null geodesics to occur .    admittedly",
    "our restrictive case of metrics of the form of are unrealistic , as any metric of this form necessarily has opposite sign pressure and energy density components of the stress tensor , and as our methods currently do not work in the more general metrics , , this is merely an observation .",
    "one scenario in which null geodesics can go into circular orbits is around black holes , and we now conclude the current section by considering such an example .",
    "we ask what information can be retrieved if the metric contains a singularity at its centre , for example schwarzschild - ads .",
    "we again can not recover the entirety of @xmath55 , as the geodesics which pass behind the horizon will not return out to the boundary .",
    "thus whilst in the non - monotonic case we had extra information ( the top branch of fig.[mend2 ] ) available but no way to get past the jump in the minimum radii of the geodesics , here we only have a reduced spectrum of endpoints from which to recover @xmath55 .",
    "the endpoints we do obtain are those with angular momentum above some critical value , and so we can use the above iterative method to recover @xmath55 down to a certain critical radius ( which will be greater than the horizon radius ) .",
    "however , any null geodesics which pass behind the horizon will always terminate at the singularity , and so we are unable to obtain any further information using our iterative method .    for an example we consider five dimensional schwarzschild - ads , in which the metric function @xmath55 is given by :    @xmath164    where @xmath4 is again the ads radius , and @xmath165 is the horizon radius .",
    "we set @xmath166 as usual , and note that the effective potential for null geodesics is given by :    @xmath167    for a null geodesic to avoid hitting the singularity at @xmath56 , we require @xmath24 for some @xmath168 .",
    "the lowest @xmath34 for which this will happen will be when the gradient of @xmath116 is also zero .",
    "differentiating with respect to @xmath31 , and setting equal to zero gives    @xmath169    which is equal to zero when @xmath170 .",
    "thus for the case where @xmath171 say , the minimum @xmath31 which can be probed by the null geodesics is @xmath172 , and hence we can obtain information about the metric function @xmath55 from @xmath173 down to @xmath172 .",
    "we have seen that the endpoints of null geodesics can be used to recover information about the bulk in asymptotically ads spacetimes . by varying the ratio of angular momentum to energy of the geodesics we are able to systematically probe to different radii , and this , combined with the appropriate ads boundary conditions , allows us to reconstruct the metric .",
    "what is perhaps quite surprising is that this local , geometric information about the spacetime can be completely recovered in certain scenarios ; in a metric of the form of , as long as the effective potential for the null geodesics is monotonic , we are able to completely recover the function @xmath55 . whilst this is of course due to the fact that we have severely restricted our spacetime in such a scenario , to ensure that the amount of information we require is contained within the bi - local spectrum of endpoints , it is still impressive that the recovery process itself is so simple .",
    "its simplicity lies in the remarkable nature of our expression for the gradient of the endpoints of null geodesics ; to have that the relative angular momentum of the geodesic corresponds to the endpoint in such an accessible fashion is astounding , and forms the basis of our ability to reconstruct the bulk .",
    "focusing on the cases with a monotonic @xmath116 , we developed two different methods for carrying out the recovery of the bulk information , both of which involved iteratively reconstructing @xmath55 from large @xmath31 down to the centre . in the process of actually using these methods to numerically extract the bulk information",
    ", we made several refinements to increase their efficiency , the most important of which involved our approximation of the gradient of @xmath55 . in both our original methods",
    ", we were consistently overestimating @xmath125 , a problem that was significantly affecting their accuracy , unless we kept the iterative step size very small . whilst we suggested a number of ways of resolving this problem , all made the process of recovering @xmath55 considerably more complex to implement , thus requiring a great deal of extra computational effort .",
    "given that one of the main aims in this work was to produce a practical method for the recovery of the metric information , these resolutions were not acceptable . rather than investigating further methods of approximating @xmath125 , we looked at the question of why we needed an approximation to the gradient of @xmath55 at all , as @xmath125 does not appear anywhere in our original geodesic equations .    the solution lay in finding an alternative to the laurent series we were using to approximate the section of the geodesic path close to its minimum radius . whilst this had been the natural approximation to use in our first method",
    ", there was a simpler one we could apply in the second , which stemmed from a crucial difference in the type of curve we were trying to approximate .",
    "in method i , the curve in question is infinite at the minimum radius , because the @xmath46 term ( see ) appears in the numerator of . in method",
    "ii , on the other hand , the @xmath46 term appears in the denominator of the relevant equation , , which results in the curve being zero with an infinite gradient .",
    "this allowed us to approximate the curve geometrically by a vertical parabola , and thus the integral by the corresponding parabolic area formula .",
    "this modification enabled us to estimate @xmath55 far more efficiently , as it removed any reference to @xmath125 .",
    "it also greatly improved the ability of the iterative process to extract what one might consider the important metric information : the numeric values relating to the `` mass '' and `` extent '' of whatever physical phenomenon was causing the deviation from pure ads .",
    "we concluded the project by considering two alternative scenarios : where the effective potential was non - monotonic , and where the metric contained a singularity at the centre . in each case",
    ", we were only able to recover @xmath55 down to a certain critical radius , corresponding to a local maximum of @xmath116 ( see fig.[mv1 ] ) .",
    "we were unable to continue the process of recovering @xmath55 any further as , in the non - singular case , there is a non - negligible `` jump '' in the minimum radii of the geodesics , due to the shape of the effective potential , which we can not well approximate . thus although we have additional endpoint data , we are unable to use it to extract more of the bulk information ; we do , however , note that in physical situations , which is where we would eventually hope to apply these techniques , we do not often encounter such metrics ( i.e. spacetimes in which light rays can enter into circular orbits ) . for those metrics containing a singularity",
    ", we do not have any further endpoints with which to continue recovering @xmath55 , as any null geodesic travelling to lower radii will pass behind the horizon and terminate at the singularity .",
    "a possible extension of this work is in considering less restrictive forms of the metric , such as those where we have relaxed spherical symmetry , or where the metric can evolve with time .",
    "whilst our previous attempt ( in section 3.3 ) at modifying the iterative methods to work in a more general spacetime failed due to the extra unknowns we introduced , this does not mean every modification would be so problematic .",
    "one can envisage , for example , a situation in which the metric function fluctuates over time , in such a way that the effective potential for the null geodesics remains monotonic throughout . in this scenario , whilst the process might be more complicated , we should still be able to extract the entire bulk metric , including the time dependence , from the complete set of null geodesic endpoints .",
    "another natural extension of this project would be to consider the endpoints of spacelike geodesics , and examine whether they can be used to recover more information about the bulk in the various scenarios .",
    "the main issue with producing a method to iteratively recover the metric information as we have done here with the null geodesics is that our equation involving the gradients of the endpoints is significantly more complicated .",
    "for spacelike geodesics we have two independent parameters ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) to consider ; simply using their ratio as we did in the null case is no longer sufficient .",
    "other works have examined this in more detail , e.g. @xcite , and they give encouragement that progress can be made in this direction .",
    "the challenge then would be whether a computationally practical method can also be found .",
    "i would like to thank veronika hubeny for insightful discussions and useful feedback throughout this work , which was supported by an epsrc studentship grant .",
    "for the null geodesic paths we have @xmath174 , and we can solve the following three equations numerically to provide the plots of the geodesics :    @xmath175    @xmath176    @xmath177    it is also useful to calculate the geodesics analytically . this can be done most easily by rewriting the original equation for the metric in a new form . rescaling the radial and time coordinates @xmath178 and",
    "@xmath179 gives :    @xmath180    where we have suppressed two of the angular coordinates as before .",
    "this leads to the modified constraint equations :    @xmath181    @xmath182    @xmath183    combining the three equations , by substituting and into to eliminate @xmath15 and @xmath16 we have :    @xmath184    rearranging , and again using to eliminate the dependence on @xmath11 gives :    @xmath185    and so @xmath186    using the substitution @xmath187 this equation becomes :    @xmath188    which implies @xmath189 and thus that    @xmath190    we can also calculate the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath33 :    @xmath191    thus :    @xmath192    which can be combined with to give :    @xmath193    note that the dependence of the geodesics on the ads radius of curvature has been scaled out in and by the choice of coordinates .",
    "to make sure our expression for the derivative of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath43 is finite , we have to combine the two terms from :    @xmath194    to eliminate the divergence piece .",
    "we need an expression for @xmath195 , obtained using our expression for @xmath43 in terms of the minimum radius , ,    @xmath196    which we then use to rewrite the second term of as an integral from @xmath197 to @xmath198 :    @xmath199    we see that the third term above cancels precisely with the divergent integral in , and after rearranging we are left with    @xmath200    which is finite .",
    "in the more general case of a spacetime described by equation , we have two unknown functions @xmath55 and @xmath99 to recover , along with @xmath31 itself , and hence we need three linearly independent equations .",
    "we appear to have them in equations , and .",
    "we now consider a geodesic with slightly lower @xmath43 and follow the method as before , except that we now use the expressions for @xmath33 and @xmath7 given in and . beginning with the expression for @xmath33 ,",
    "we split it up as in and evaluate the second integral as in .",
    "this leaves              which initially appears to be linearly independent of , as although the first term in is simply the first term in divided by @xmath83 , the two second terms appear different . even rewriting the second and third terms of using        the degeneracy",
    "occurs because we are attempting to use these two equations , along with @xmath77 , to recover @xmath75 , @xmath81 and @xmath208 ; we already have values for the other variables .",
    "thus the only term which is of importance in recovering the unknowns is the first , and the apparent independence of the two equations has arisen from our approximation of the second term . hence equations and effectively both reduce to :        99 g.  t hooft , _",
