    "the most ubiquitous form of order is the one involving the breaking of space translations and rotations leading to the solid form of matter . dealing with the solids of everyday life , but also with the wigner crystals formed in low density electron systems , this is easily understood in terms of minimization of the potential energy associated with the interactions between the constituents .",
    "since the 1950 s it has been well understood that the order can also occur in highly itinerant systems in the form of the peierls mechanism .",
    "this relies on the hartree - fock type mean field theory .",
    "the order parameter turns into a potential diffracting the electron waves of the nearly free system ; the order is stabilized by the energy gain associated with opening a gap at the fermi energy .",
    "the hartree - fock type theory is controlled at zero temperature by the diminishing of the collective quantum fluctuations of the order and it can therefore also be reliable when the interactions become strong . in the late 1980 s",
    "it was discovered that according to the hartree - fock theory the electronic stripes should be formed in strongly coupled doped mott insulators @xcite .",
    "this refers to textures formed from antiferromagnetic mott - insulating domains , separated by lines of charge ( in two dimensions ) which are at the same time domain walls in the spin background .",
    "such insulating stripes turned out to be ubiquitous in generic doped mott insulators ( nickelates , cobaltates , manganites ) . in 1995",
    "a stripe - like ordering phenomenon was discovered in the 214 family of cuprate superconductors @xcite , but it became immediately clear that these were in crucial respects different from the hartree - fock variant : these turned out to be  half - filled \" and associated with metallic and even superconducting states @xcite .",
    "quite recently there has been a resurgence of interest in this subject by the discovery of  stripe like \" order in the 2212 and 123 families of superconductors , which is yet behaving differently from the 214 stripes @xcite . despite the large body of theoretical proposals ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it appears that these are yet far from being completely understood .",
    "the next surprise happened in 1998 , by the discovery of white and scalapino that the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) computations on the @xmath1 model revealed stripes that appear to be quite literally like the ones experimentally observed in the 214 cuprates @xcite .",
    "the very recent results obtained using the fanciful infinite projected entangled - pair state method add further credibility to this claim @xcite .",
    "all along it has been obvious that the differences with the hartree - fock stripes are caused by the strong quantum nature of the spin one - half system .",
    "however , up to the present day an explanation of these numerical results in terms of a general physics principle has been lacking . leaving a detailed analysis of this many - hole problem to future work",
    ", we focus here on this physics principle itself in the simplest possible setting , namely , the @xmath1 model doped with a single hole .",
    "this single hole problem has itself a long history @xcite . in the late 1980 s",
    "it was asserted that this could be solved using the linear spin wave  self - consistent born approximation approach @xcite .",
    "one assumes that the spin system can be parametrized in terms of the spin waves , and the hole - spin wave scattering is treated in the rainbow approximation .",
    "the outcome is an electron - like quasiparticle that propagates facilitated by the quantum spin fluctuations governed by the superexchange interaction .",
    "however , there is a subtlety that is ignored in this approach . upon hopping in the quantum spin background",
    "the hole acquires a phase of @xmath2 whenever it exchanges its position with a down(@xmath3)-spin , the so - called `` phase strings '' @xcite .",
    "these are genuine quantum phases , that can be understood as the  left - overs \" of the fermion signs after mott - projection , becoming alive when mobile holes are present @xcite .",
    "these give rise to interference effects which are very different from the ones familiar from simple quantum mechanics , since they are inherently tied to the quantum many - body nature of the spin system .",
    "it was recently @xcite demonstrated that this goes so far that even in the perfect translationally invariant case the hole is subjected to self - localization @xcite .",
    "in section  [ sec : interference ] we will unveil the nature of the mechanism leading to this self - localization , resting on a general path - integral consideration and a mean - field like approximation .",
    "it turns out to be a close cousin of the usual mechanism leading to anderson localization @xcite ; the crucial difference is that it acts out in the presence of a perfect lattice translational symmetry , while the interference mechanism giving rise to enhanced backscattering can be directly traced to the phase strings .",
    "along the same lines we will also demonstrate that this phase - string interference drives the spontaneous charge modulation in the single hole case , representing a charge ordering mechanism which is uniquely tied to the many - body physics realized in strongly interacting doped mott insulators .",

    ", width=288,height=96 ]        in essence , at small length scales the phase strings give rise to a coherent propagation of the hole through the quantum spin background characterized by sharp single - particle momenta , with the momentum value set by the many - body physics of the quantum spin background .",
    "this coherent propagation is however confined on larger scales by the localization volume that acts like a box .",
    "this has in turn the consequence that the interference between the left- and right - propagating modes of the hole inside this volume can form standing waves corresponding to the charge modulations .    to convince the reader",

    "we identify an analog of the mechanism for the familiar anderson localization , to subsequently unveil the origin of the spontaneous charge modulation in terms of interference of emergent left- and right - movers inside the localization volume .",
    "this analysis reveals the cause of the highly surprising dependence of the modulation period on the rung coupling : it is set by the probability @xmath12 for the hole ( injected by removing a @xmath3-spin electron ) to exchange its position with an up(@xmath13)-spin nearest neighbor , a quantity that measures effectively the density of phase string signs in the spin vacuum . in section  [ sec : discussion ] we will end with an outlook , discussing the potential ramifications of this mechanism for charge modulation in the broader context of the physics of doped mott insulators .",

    "these two models are reduced to the same heisenberg spin ladders with an empty site , and a spin-@xmath87 will distribute around the impurity site with a short - ranged antiferromagnetic oscillation due to the underlying spin - spin correlation .",

    "this also explains why the wavenumbers of these two modulations are approximately the same , in contrast to many conventional systems in which the charge modulation is usually observed to be the second harmonic of a spin modulation .",
    "in the exposition of the numerical results it shimmers through that somehow the hole injected into the @xmath1 model yields to the principles of free - particle quantum mechanics . however , very different from the  simple \" wave interference mechanisms behind anderson localization and the friedel oscillations we are now dealing with a strongly interacting system .",
    "the very origin of the interference phenomena encountered in this context is rooted in many - particle physics of a particularly hairy kind ",

    "the interference may be either constructive or destructive .",
    "before we demonstrate the specific mechanism behind the charge modulations , we can already discern the mechanism of the self - localization from this path integral formulation :    * in the special case of @xmath101 , all paths have the same phase ( modulo @xmath111 ) since they differ in an even number of hoppings .",

    "different from the standard anderson localization mechanism in quenched disordered systems , our numerical simulations reported in the previous section revealed that the phase - string driven self - localization mechanism goes hand in hand with a rather precise quantization of the states in single - hole momentum space , i.e. , the sharp peaks in the single - hole momentum distribution .",
    "the fact that the system retains perfect translational invariance is of course a necessary condition for this to happen .",

    "@xcite we may view such self - localization  within the ring  as free propagation confined by tunneling barriers placed on both ends . because of the aforementioned compactification the hole may circulate in the ring : this is equivalent to the motion in a @xmath148d `` perfect crystal '' with a ( spatial ) period of @xmath29 [ fig .",

    "viewed from a general physics perspective , the considerations in this work have unveiled a new mechanism causing charge modulation associated with strongly interacting fermions at a high density  it is physics associated with the  fermion sign \" problem . from this perspective , it is a cousin of the well - known friedel oscillations of the free fermion gas . in the free case , the  fermion signs \" just translate to the pauli principle having the ramification that the states reacting to an impurity potential or an open boundary are quantum mechanical waves with a short wavelength inversely proportional to the fermi momentum  this period exhibits itself in the conventional  wiggles \" . when mott - ness takes over for sufficiently strong coulomb repulsions the basic rules of the fermion statistics is drastically altered : because of the  stay - at - home \" principle the fermions turn into spins at half filling , and spins are distinguishable particles .",
    "but in the presence of holes , fermion exchanges are restored in the  intermediate vicinity \" of the delocalizing holes : the phase strings just enumerate how fermion signs re - enter the problem @xcite .    in the single - hole case",
    "this boils down to the master rule that world histories in the path - integral formulation acquire an overall sign associated with the number of times that the hole exchanges with a down - spin .",
    "as we demonstrated in section [ sec : interference ] , for a particular path one can adopt the mean - field like approximation of averaging over these  dynamical signs \" . strikingly , with this approximation , a quantum mechanical like dynamics automatically emerges . for this `` emergent quantum mechanics ''",
    "a disordered potential is self - generated by the fluctuating spin background , and the phase arises from phase strings . by fundamental principles of physics of quantum disordered systems one may naturally expect the occurrence of anderson localization like phenomenon .",
    "indeed , we have shown an interference picture for self - localization which is the same as that for familiar anderson localization .",
    "of course , whether the quantitative behavior , such as the single parameter scaling @xcite , exists here calls for more sophisticated investigations .",
    "the charge modulations occur automatically in this self - localized regime .",
    "the averaging of phase strings makes it possible for the hole to propagate in a quantum mechanical fashion , characterized by wave vectors that are determined by the spin fluctuations .",
    "these in turn have in common with the usual friedel oscillations that an effective finite volume is needed for them to form standing waves corresponding to the charge modulations ; otherwise the hole would spread out over the entire system and the charge modulations would diminish .",
    "however , completely different from the canonical quantum mechanics behind the friedel oscillations , the modulation period is not at all set by density via the fermi momentum , but instead by the severity of the quantum spin fluctuations in the vacuum .",
    "we emphasize that the mechanism is anchored in general principle and it should be very robust : by tailoring the right conditions it should be observable in the laboratory .",
    "ideally one would like to depart from an experimental realization of a two - leg ladder system characterized by a rung coupling @xmath9 which is strong enough . by electrolyte",
    "gating one could then force in holes keeping the system very clean .",
    "the interest would be in the regime of very low carrier density , avoiding a metallic like behavior .",
    "the reason is that the long - ranged coulomb interaction should be kept strong enough to prohibit the pairing tendencies .",
    "ideally a wigner crystal would be realized ; in the vicinity of the carriers one would then expect our charge modulations which are in principle measurable by scanning tunneling spectroscopy .",
    "their modulation wavelength could then be related to the properties of the spin system by carefully quantifying the latter by inelastic neutron scattering and so forth .",
    "we have analyzed here specifically the case of a two - leg ladder doped with a single hole .",
    "what are the ramifications in general , considering lattices of higher dimensions or finite hole densities ?",
    "we are exploring these at present , and let us present some preliminary results . for the single - hole doped case , the charge modulation has been found to persist in other even - leg @xmath1 ladders as well , provided that a spin gap is present in the spin system . for an odd - leg ladder ,",
    "we do not find the charge modulation even though the charge remains localized .",
    "this appears to be related to a particular self - averaging of the scattering phase @xmath157 caused by the gapless spin fluctuations , smearing the interference patterns associated with the left- and right - moving propagating modes .",
    "the charge modulation is expected to reemerge in a gapless spin system only at finite doping , when the spin - spin correlation in the background becomes short - ranged due to the doping .",
    "given that we are dealing with a strongly interacting , dense fermion system it is a - priori not obvious whether the physics of a single carrier in isolation has dealings with the physics of the system at any finite density .",
    "one immediate  complication \" is by now well established : two holes in a @xmath1 ladder will immediately bind in a  cooper pair \" , where yet again the phase strings play a crucial role in the binding mechanism @xcite .",
    "turning to the truly finite density case on many - rung ladders ( or the 2d square lattice ) the dmrg computations already showed a long time ago the 214-like stripes @xcite .",
    "these appear to be formed in essence from the preformed pairs and these are not supposed to show the single hole modulations , as we just argued . however , we have preliminary indications that the phase strings also control the truly co - operative translational symmetry breaking in this case , although the precise mechanism appears to be different . upon switching off the phase strings by employing the @xmath42 model , we find that the stripes do disappear .",
    "we leave a precise analysis of this physics to a future publication .",
    "we wish to mention that discussions on the weak coupling two - leg hubbard ladders have been well documented where , notably , a standard quasiparticle picture works well @xcite .",
    "an outstanding problem left by the present work is , i.e. , how to connect such a weak coupling regime with the strong coupling regime , especially in the parameter regime where the half - filled ground state remains fully gapped in both weak and strong coupling .",
    "based on our present results , we expect that the weak and strong coupling limits might be smoothly connected in the strong rung regime , where the quasiparticle behavior is well established at @xmath56 in the @xmath1 ladder .",
    "whereas at @xmath44 , a `` phase transition '' in mott nature is expected so that the quasiparticle behavior for weak coupling could be replaced by the charge localization for strong coupling observed in this work .",
    "this issue is currently under investigations .",
    "after this paper was submitted , a dmrg paper has recently appeared in ref .  , where critical comments on the present work were made .",
    "first of all , the numerical simulations in that work confirm some of the main results reported here and in an earlier work @xcite , namely the charge modulation and the existence of a quantum critical point in the anisotropic @xmath4-@xmath5 ladders .",
    "however , the authors of that paper made a drastically different interpretation about the physics happening at @xmath44 .",
    "they claim that the quasiparticle picture is still valid accompanying the momentum splitting shown in fig .",

    "but we point out that a finite quasiparticle spectral weight should be associated with the quantity @xmath165 , not @xmath166 . for a translationally invariant system ,",
    "these two quantities are indeed equivalent since the ground state has a well - defined bloch momentum .",
    "but in the presence of localization and accompanied charge modulation , the translational symmetry is broken .",
    "hence , one can not validate the quasiparticle picture by a finite @xmath166 because it may be contributed by a spectrum of momenta in the ground state ( recalling @xmath167 ) . as a matter of fact , in fig .",
    "[ fig : edifference ] we have compared the ground - state energy difference between the periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions imposed on the charge sector , and the envelope of this energy deviation ( as a function of ladder length @xmath29 ) decays exponentially with @xmath29 .",
