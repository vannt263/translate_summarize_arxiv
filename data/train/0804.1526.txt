    "jellium is a simple model of metals .",
    "the surface properties of jellium can emulate those of real surfaces . in this popular model the lattice of ions",
    "is replaced by a uniform positive charge density .",
    "lang and kohn  @xcite made the first self - consistent calculation of the surface properties of this model using the local spin density ( lsd ) approximation  @xcite for the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy within the kohn - sham density functional formalism  @xcite .",
    "the results , after a correction for lattice effects , agreed surprisingly well with experiments .",
    "this unexpected success initiated the application of the density functional theory to surfaces .",
    "a restricted variational calculation by mahan  @xcite gave density profiles and surface energies very similar to those of lang and kohn .",
    "perdew and monnier  @xcite performed a series of self - consistent calculations of the surface properties of real and jellium metals within lsd .",
    "kautz and schwartz  @xcite extended the work of lang and kohn to the spin - polarized case and calculated self - consistently several surface properties of jellium polarized by a magnetic field uniform inside and zero outside the edge of the positive background . over the past few decades",
    ", the correct surface energy of jellium has been controversial .",
    "recent work  @xcite resolves most of the controversy , placing this energy close to but probably a little higher than that of lsd ( which benefits from a strong error cancellation between exchange and correlation ) . for a review of this and earlier work , see ref .  .    in density",
    "functional theory  @xcite , everything is treated exactly except the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy , which has to be approximated as a functional of the electron density .",
    "development of better density functional approximations has been the subject of continuing theoretical efforts .",
    "lsd is the simplest approximation and has been successful in condensed matter physics .",
    "however , it tends to overbind molecules .",
    "an efficient way to solve this problem is to introduce the density gradient @xmath0 as an additional local ingredient to construct a gradient - corrected density functional , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite . with the advent of gga ,",
    "density functional theory has become a popular method in quantum chemistry as well .",
    "although ggas have achieved significant improvement over lsd for most properties and for diverse systems  @xcite , they usually underestimate the surface exchange - correlation energy of a spin - unpolarized jellium , for which lsd is much more accurate  @xcite .",
    "further systematic improvement over ggas may be made by imposing additional exact conditions without losing those already satisfied by gga .",
    "this can be done by employing the kinetic energy densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and/or the laplacians of the densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 , as further additional ingredients . here",
    "the kinetic energy density of electrons with spin @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the occupied kohn - sham orbitals , which are implicit functionals of the density @xmath9 .",
    "( atomic units @xmath10 are used throughout unless otherwise explicitly stated . )",
    "this family of density functional approximations is called meta - gga  @xcite .",
    "while the exact form of the universal functional remains unknown , many exact constraints on this exact functional have been uncovered .",
    "thus the more exact constraints a density functional satisfies , the closer it is to the exact universal functional . having this in mind , perdew , kurth ,",
    "zupan , and blaha ( pkzb )  @xcite constructed a meta - gga from first - principles .",
    "this nearly non - empirical functional satisfies two important constraints which can not be satisfied at the gga level : it nearly recovers the known fourth - order gradient expansion  @xcite of the exchange energy in the slowly - varying limit and it is free from self - correlation errors .",
    "pkzb meta - gga has impressively corrected  @xcite the too - low surface exchange - correlation energy of gga functionals , and has successfully improved upon lsd and ggas in thermochemistry for molecular atomization energies  @xcite .",
    "the defect of pkzb is that it contains an empirical parameter in its exchange term , which was fitted to molecular atomization energies .",
    "consequently , pkzb produces too - long bond lengths and some inaccurate properties of hydrogen - bonded complexes  @xcite .",
    "these failures may be attributed to the unbalanced description of pkzb exchange and correlation for slowly - varying densities and one- or two - electron densities , which are the paradigms in condensed matter physics and in quantum chemistry , respectively .    starting with the pbe gga , tao , perdew , staroverov , and scuseria ( tpss )  @xcite",
    "have constructed a nonempirical meta - gga .",
    "while the formula for tpss looks a little more complicated than the pkzb one , the guiding theory is simple .",
    "a sound meta - gga should be able to describe well the paradigm densities of condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry . by imposing correct constraints ,",
    "a meta - gga can be made accurate for diverse systems of interest .",
    "the tpss construction builds many additional correct constraints  @xcite into a meta - gga , while retaining those that the gga has already respected . as a result ,",
    "this meta - gga is uniformly accurate for various properties of diverse systems  @xcite , suggesting the correctness of the tpss philosophy .    for high - density ( exchange dominated ) systems such as atoms ,",
    "the tpss is remarkably accurate  @xcite . in the low - density or strong - interaction limit",
    ", tpss recovers the pkzb correlation , which is accurate for spin - unpolarized densities .",
    "the relative spin polarization is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "since tpss correlation strives to represent a self - correlation correction to pbe , it should not change pbe correlation for a system with delocalized electrons , whether spin - polarized or not .",
    "this requirement is satisfied by tpss through design for a spin - unpolarized jellium  @xcite .",
    "however , we never impose this requirement for a spin - polarized density .",
    "instead we first scale to the low - density limit  @xcite and there require  @xcite the exchange - correlation energy to be correctly independent of spin for a model uniformly spin - polarized one - electron gaussian density with constant relative spin polarization in the range @xmath13 , like lsd and pbe and unlike pkzb .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the spin dependence of tpss correlation and find that it is nearly the same as that of the pbe for spin - polarized jellium generated by magnetic fields , implying that tpss does not alter the pbe correlation energy for a spin - polarized system with delocalized electrons .",
    "since tpss successfully improves on lsd for spin - unpolarized jellium and has the proper spin dependence , we estimate the surface exchange - correlation energy and work function with the tpss meta - gga functional for a spin - polarized jellium in magnetic fields .",
    "an application to the infinite barrier model ( ibm )  @xcite of metal surfaces is a related test but for rapidly - varying densities .",
    "the other tests considered here are jellium spheres ( which sample the surface and curvature energy ) and the linear response of bulk jellium .",
    "density functionals may be ordered by the ",
    "jacob s ladder \"  @xcite of approximations , according to the type of their local ingredients , whether constructed nonempirically or empirically .",
    "here we only focus on the all - purpose nonempirical functionals , lsd , pbe and tpss , and the nearly nonempirical pkzb , but not the ones recently developed for solids and solid surfaces such as am05  @xcite , wu - cohen  @xcite , and pbesol  @xcite .",

    "the largest value of @xmath114 ( for all @xmath113 ) found in that way marks the onset of jellium instability . in this way we confirmed that , for exchange and correlation combined , tpss does not alter much the prediction of lsd for the onset of jellium instability , which occurs for @xmath115 a.u .",

    "in conclusion , we have calculated and compared the jellium surface exchange - correlation energies of the pbe gga and the tpss meta - gga and of these two functionals when uniformly scaled to the high- and low - density limits for the normal bulk valence densities in magnetic fields . in all the cases , the fairly good agreement of the pbe gga with the tpss meta - gga shows that the tpss meta - gga indeed represents the self - correlation correction of the pbe gga .",
    "we have further found that the `` internal '' magnetic field of eq.([kautz ] ) and the external uniform field of eq.([ew ] ) are typically opposite to each other in their effects on the work function and surface exchange - correlation energy of jellium .",
    "we have also calculated the energies of jellium spheres with lsd , pbe gga , and tpss and its predecessor pkzb meta - ggas . typically , while pbe energies are too low for spheres with more than about two electrons , lsd and tpss are accurate there , up to 106 electrons .",
    "curvature energies are reduced substantially as we pass from lsd to pbe to tpss .",
    "finally , we have shown that the linear response of bulk jellium ( to perturbations with wavevectors less than twice the fermi wavevector ) is reasonably described by all the functionals considered here .",
    "as we climb the ladder of nonempirical density functional approximations from lsd to gga to meta - gga , there is a steady and dramatic improvement in atomization energies  @xcite .",
    "surface energies worsen  @xcite from lsd to pbe gga ( and other popular ggas ) , due to an imperfect error cancellation between exchange and correlation , but this can be corrected in any of three ways : ( 1 ) by transferring  @xcite the needed correction from jellium to real systems , ( 2 ) by using ggas designed specifically for solids ( and not for free atoms )  @xcite , or ( 3 ) by climbing up further to the tpss meta - gga .",
    "the third way adds little in computational cost  @xcite , even at full selfconsistency , and seems worthy of further testing and possible refinement .",
    "the jellium model itself remains useful as a testing ground for density functionals .",
    "although some of its properties become unphysical as one moves away from the bulk density at which jellium is stable ( @xmath117 , roughly the valence density of sodium ) , this problem can also be fixed inexpensively via the stabilized jellium model  @xcite .",

    "<S> jellium , a simple model of metals , is a standard testing ground for density functionals , both for bulk and for surface properties . </S>",
    "<S> earlier tests show that the tao - perdew - staroverov - scuseria ( tpss ) nonempirical meta - generalized gradient approximation ( meta - gga ) for the exchange - correlation energy yields more accurate surface energies than the local spin density ( lsd ) approximation for spin - unpolarized jellium . in this study , </S>",
    "<S> work functions and surface energies of a jellium metal in the presence of `` internal '' and external magnetic fields are calculated with lsd , perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) gga , and tpss meta - gga and its predecessor , the nearly nonempirical perdew - kurth - zupan - blaha ( pkzb ) meta - gga , using self - consistent lsd orbitals and densities . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that : ( i ) for normal bulk densities , the surface correlation energy is the same in tpss as in pbe , as it should be since tpss strives to represent a self - correlation correction to pbe ; ( ii ) normal surface density profiles can be scaled uniformly to the low - density or strong - interaction limit , and tpss provides an estimate for that limit that is consistent with ( but probably more accurate than ) other estimates ; ( iii ) for both normal and low densities , tpss provides the same description of surface magnetism as pbe , suggesting that these approximations may be generally equivalent for magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> the energies of jellium spheres with up to 106 electrons are calculated using density functionals and compared to those obtained with diffusion quantum monte carlo data , including our estimate for the fixed - node correction . </S>",
    "<S> typically , while pbe energies are too low for spheres with more than about two electrons , lsd and tpss are accurate there . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that curvature energies are lower in pbe and tpss than in lsd . </S>",
    "<S> finally we calculate the linear response of bulk jellium using these density functionals , and find that not only lsd but also pbe gga and tpss meta - gga yield a linear - response in good agreement with that of the quantum monte carlo method , for wavevectors of the perturbing external potential up to twice the fermi wavevector . </S>"
