    "the present generation of largely parabolic dish - based radio interferometers and data analysis procedures are poorly optimized for discovering transient emission .",
    "consequently , the characteristics of transient radio source populations remain highly undersampled . nevertheless , dedicated programs are revealing novel radio transients with unique emission characteristics , including gcrt j1745@xmath23009 .",
    "discovered in 325 mhz archival vla data taken in september 2002 , this source exhibited @xmath310 minute long , 1 jy peaked bursts with a @xmath377 minute period over the @xmath37 hour baseline available in the discovery data @xcite .",
    "the measured time scales of the bursts implied a brightness temperature exceeding the 10@xmath4 k compton limit for a distance beyond @xmath3100 pc .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , its characteristics did not match any known mechanisms of emission in transient compact sources . as a result",
    ", gcrt j1745@xmath23009 appeared to represent a member of a new class of coherently emitting objects .",
    "search to detect additional bursts from the source in archival data sets were made , resulting in its re - detection for @xmath32 minutes at 325 mhz giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) observation in september 2003 @xcite and in march 2004 @xcite . at the last known epoch of emission detected in 2004 ,",
    "the source exhibited an unusually steep spectrum with alpha = @xmath213@xmath53 ( s ( @xmath6)@xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain the emission from gcrt j1745 - 3009 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these include nulling @xcite , double @xcite , precessing @xcite and a transient white dwarf pulsar @xcite .",
    "also , @xcite suggested a nearby ultracool dwarf as its progenitor .",
    "unfortunately , non - detection of gcrt j1745@xmath23009 at frequencies other than 325 mhz @xcite hindered attempts to discover its progenitor .",
    "its brightness temperature in possible excess of the compton limit suggests coherent processes such as electron cyclotron maser emission or plasma emission .",
    "notably , both of these mechanisms produce circularly polarized emission , motivating us to re - examine earlier detections of gcrt j1745@xmath23009 in search of its signature .",
    "we have reanalyzed the 325 mhz gmrt data from september 2003 , the detection with the highest signal to noise ratio per integration time available .",
    "the subsequent sections are arranged as follows - in sect . 2 and 3",
    "we describe our reanalysis procedure and its results , respectively .",
    "the interpretation of these results are presented in sect . 4 and conclusions in sect . 5",
    "during the observations , the pointing center of the gmrt antennas was 0.5@xmath8 west of gcrt j1745@xmath23009 ( hereafter gcrt ) .",
    "the unpolarized calibrator 3c48 was observed for absolute gain calibration - see hyman et al .",
    "2006 for further details of the observation and total intensity calibration . at the time of these observations ,",
    "the full polarization mode of the gmrt was unavailable and only parallel - hand correlations ( stokes rr and ll ) were recorded .",
    "if the polarization leakage coefficients of antenna ` i ' is denoted by d@xmath9 , then the observed right circularly polarized signal on the @xmath10-@xmath11 baseline is @xmath12 in general , the quantities are complex ; we denote the ` true ' values without primes and the measured quantities with primes ; and a similar equation holds for the left circularly polarized signal @xmath13 . during standard calibration without full polarization information ,",
    "the leakage terms are considered small and discarded .",
    "however , the above equation shows that even for an unpolarized source the last two terms [ @xmath14 lead to amplitude closure errors .",
    "if the source is linearly polarized ( @xmath15 ) , additional errors are added .    to determine magnitudes of these leakage coefficients , the connections for the 2 polarizations of a single antenna",
    "is reversed .",
    "this allows acquiring cross products of opposite handed polarizations of one antenna with the rest of the antennas .",
    "observations of strong unpolarized calibrators have shown that @xmath16 at  325  mhz .",
    "since the leakage terms for different antennas are expected to be uncorrelated , the estimated error in stokes v in the image plane for even a 100% linearly polarized source will be @xmath17 5% of stokes i. moreover , the polarization leakage in antennas can not add coherently in this case , indicating absence of any significant spurious small diameter source in stokes v in the image plane .",
    "however , the above analysis is valid for a source along the axis of the antennas and the gcrt was off - axis by 0.5@xmath8 .",
    "antenna off - axis positions may suffer from correlated patterns among the antennas ( e.g. , different fwhm of the right and left circularly polarized primary beams ) leading to non zero stokes v. therefore , we obtained supplementary polarization calibration observations of the unpolarized calibrator 3c48 at 325 mhz with 20 different angular offsets within the fwhm of the antenna primary beam .",
    "1 shows that the pointing positions sampled a range of primary beam offsets extending beyond the gcrt offset as observed on 2003 sep 28 .",
    "these observations were sufficiently short such that rotation in feed parallactic angle within any particular pointing position were negligible .",
    "for all the off - axis positions after calibration , the maximum value of stokes v was found to be 0.02 times stokes i. hence , the error in stokes v within the fwhm of the antennas is @xmath182% of stokes i for an unpolarized source and @xmath175% for a high linearly polarized source at 325 mhz band of gmrt .    ) and the inner circle is half of that distance .",
    "azimuth is along x - axis , and elevation along y-axis.the location of the gcrt is indicated by an open circle.,title=\"fig : \" ]    a variant of multi - resolution clean was used to better image the non - variable and extended field sources .",
    "after amplitude and phase self - calibration of non - variable sources , all sources except one were subtracted from the _ uv_-data and the inverse of the amplitude self - calibration table applied to avoid changes in the flux density of the gcrt during imaging .",
    "subsequently , the gcrt and the strong compact field source ( g358.917 + 0.073 , located 0.2@xmath8 away from the phase center ) not subtracted in the above step were imaged simultaneously from every time sample in the data to confirm the amplitude stability of non - variable sources .",
    "the rms noise in the maps are @xmath334 mjy.beam@xmath19 in each polarization .",
    "the equivalent stokes i noise @xmath325 mjy.beam@xmath19 is approximately a factor of 2 lower than in hyman et al",
    "we attribute the significant reduction in noise due to better removal of extended sources before imaging gcrt coupled with more aggressive inner _ uv _ cutoffs ( 3.3 k - lambda vs. 2 k - lambda employed by hyman et al .",
    "light curves of the unresolved source , the gcrt , during its active state on september 28 , 2003 along with the unrelated compact field source g358.917 + 0.073 using their peak flux densities are shown in fig . 2 ( top panel ) for both the polarizations .",
    "due to a correction in data timestamps produced by upgraded observatory software , the time used in this paper lags by 7.4 sec relative to @xcite .",
    "the peak flux density of both the sources are smaller for the first data point , which is erroneously reduced by the data acquisition software at the start of data acquisition scans .",
    "the plot shows that while the flux density for both the polarizations of the unrelated field source are equal and steady within the error - bars , the flux density of the gcrt varies systematically with time . at the start of the scan ,",
    "the rr flux density is higher than the ll , but it drops almost exponentially to zero after about 200 seconds and after which the gcrt could not be identified . due to lower rms noise than @xcite , we have been able to detect the source for @xmath31.5 times longer duration than reported earlier .",
    "@xcite searched for circular polarization from this source in a map made using data averaged over the time scale of emission and derived an upper limit of 15% .",
    "however , because the difference between the two polarizations changes sign within the averaging time , their ability to constrain stokes v was smeared out . adopting their approach during our re - analysis yields a stokes v of 12% , consistent with their reported limit .",
    "more recent reanalysis of its 2002 outburst @xcite yields an upper limit of 8% on the fraction of circular polarization averaged over the emission timescale . to study the variation of the circular polarization",
    ", we have also made maps of the gcrt in stokes v , and a light curve made from these maps is shown in fig .",
    "2 ( middle panel ) . in stokes v , the rms noise in the map is @xmath317 mjy.beam@xmath20 , quite close to the expected thermal noise .",
    "+ the figure shows that the sign of stokes v reverses after about 100 sec from the start of the scan and within the data averaging time of @xmath317 sec .",
    "if the fastest variation in the source properties approach the velocity of light , the emission region would be smaller than 8  r@xmath0 .",
    "2 ( bottom panel ) shows the ratio of stokes v to i obtained by dividing the stokes v maps by the stokes i maps of the same timestamps using comb in aips .",
    "it shows the fractional circular polarization is initially low , but increases with time .",
    "after 100 seconds from the start of the scan it reverses sign .",
    "the fraction of circular polarization approaches @xmath3100% about 150 seconds from the start of the scan .",
    "3 shows a gray scale map of the difference of stokes v images made from data integrated between 35 to 103 and 103 to 155 seconds from the start of scan , respectively , during which the sign of stoves v reversed .",
    "this result ( @xmath216 @xmath22 ) represents our highest significance detection of stokes - v from the gcrt .    .",
    "the location of the gcrt is at the center.,scaledwidth=96.0% ]    due to large closure errors on the calibrators with lower side band data from the correlator , the bandwidth of the present analysis was limited to 16 mhz .",
    "the measured stokes i spectral index ( @xmath23 ) is @xmath24 , which is better constrained than in @xcite ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have also reanalyzed the september 2002 and march 2004 gcrt detections .",
    "however , we could not detect any significant circular polarization from those 2 epochs , and our upper limits remain as in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "from the measured flux density and the decay time scale ( @xmath26 min ) of the 2002 bursts , @xcite placed an upper limit of 70 pc , which has been revised to 14 pc @xcite for incoherent emission . adopting the @xmath27 sec time scale for polarization reversal derived from our new analysis of the detected 2003 burst as the fastest variation yields an upper limit of 8 r@xmath0 on its size . assuming the above size of emission region in 2002 emission lowers the distance limit to @xmath28 pc .",
    "given a very low probability of encountering an object within 1 pc and taking this as a distance lower limit still implies a brightness temperature @xmath2110@xmath29 k. such a high brightness temperature and circular polarization fraction reaching @xmath3100% rules out thermal emission and incoherent non - thermal emission like synchrotron and gyro - synchrotron @xcite , and indicates a coherent emission mechanism .",
    "coherent radiation is known to arise from 3 different processes , ( i ) pulsar emission , ( ii ) electron cyclotron maser emission and ( iii ) plasma emission , which are discussed below .",
    "pulsar emission could produce highly circularly polarized emission within a single pulse .",
    "however , the integration time ( 16.8 sec ) used in the data is longer than the pulse period of any known pulsar , and circular polarization fraction of pulsars goes down when averaged over a full pulse and is typically found to be significantly less than 100% near an observing frequency of 325 mhz ( d. mitra , private communication ) .",
    "this argues against any pulsar - based model as an explanation for the observed properties of the gcrt .",
    "+ electron cyclotron maser emission occurs at the electron gyro - frequency and its harmonics and could also produce highly circularly polarized emission @xcite .",
    "if the gcrt emission at 330 mhz was due to cyclotron emission at its fundamental frequency , the required magnetic field is @xmath3120 gauss and @xmath32 lower at the second harmonic .",
    "these are typical values of magnetic field in a stellar corona .",
    "the relative bandwidth of emission is @xmath30 for electrons with speed @xmath31 , and is typically @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the individual spikes of emission could have durations much smaller than our integration time and could have occured from different physical locations .",
    "a significant variation of magnetic fields within these spikes of emission would cause a variation of emitting frequencies causing a broadening of observed bandwidth . this could account for @xmath3330 mhz bandwidth observed in @xcite .",
    "the very steep spectral index reported in @xcite could also be explained if the peak of emission at that time occured at @xmath34310 mhz .",
    "+ plasma emission occurs at the plasma frequency or one of its lower order harmonics .",
    "it involves plasma instabilities and subsequent conversion of a fraction of its energy to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "different mechanisms of generating plasma instabilities are known @xcite .",
    "common characteristics of these are narrow band emission with a high level ( approaching 100% ) of circular polarization and high brightness temperature at meter wavelengths .",
    "the typical bandwidth of plasma emission is @xmath35 .",
    "however , as described above , there could be several spots of emission slightly differing in frequency , which would also explain a bandwidth of @xmath2132 mhz as reported in @xcite .",
    "we note that plasma frequency of 330 mhz corresponds to an ion density of @xmath310@xmath36 ions.@xmath37 , which is less likely but can not be ruled out in the corona of a brown dwarf .",
    "however , untill the magnetic field strengths or ion density could be measured near the object , any electron cyclotron or plasma emission mechanism attributable to the object can not as yet be firmly established .",
    "if the upper limit to the brightness temperature ( @xmath38 ) and the linear size ( @xmath39 ) of the emission region is known , an upper limit to its distance ( d ) can be calculated . for electron cyclotron maser emission",
    ", it is found that @xmath38 could reach 10@xmath40 k as in auroral kilometric radiation @xcite .",
    "this upper limit has also been estimated theoretically @xcite . for plasma emission , @xmath38 is expected to be less than 10@xmath41 k @xcite . however , for a certain type of plasma emission from double layers , @xmath38 could reach 10@xmath42 k @xcite .",
    "therefore , we could easily consider the upper limit on its @xmath38 to be 10@xmath40 k. with l @xmath178 r@xmath0 ( sect .",
    "4 ) , the upper limit on its distance is @xmath43 kpc , which indicates that the emission does not originate from another galaxy .",
    "however , this limit can be much improved by considering known sources of circular polarisation in the galaxy , which are not ruled out already .",
    "most of the known low frequency emitting objects are either synchrotron or thermal sources , from which the circular polarization fraction is less than a few percent",
    ". however , flare stars in the galaxy could emit strong high circularly polarized emission .",
    "these objects are typically dwarfs stars of class g to m ( mostly m ) .",
    "some of them could be of size @xmath30.15 r@xmath0 ( e.g. , uv cet with spectral type m6 ) .",
    "as described in @xcite , more than 50 observations have been carried out in radio bands towards them from the early days of radio astronomy in 1958 to 2001 and cover a frequency range from 20 mhz to several ghz .",
    "the flux densities recorded for these flares at cm wavelengths are typically in millijanskys , and the highest recorded was only a fraction of a jy",
    ". however , at lower frequencies , particularly at decameter wavelengths , flux densities of some of the flares recorded are @xmath3100 jy @xcite to @xmath44 jy @xcite .",
    "the highest luminosity of any flare star(s ) in the metre wave band is @xmath3230 jy at 136 mhz as recorded by @xcite towards the orion nebula located @xmath3400 pc away .",
    "if the luminosity of the gcrt in the 2002 outburst is the same , it would be located at a distance of @xmath34 kpc .",
    "earlier observations of flare stars showed wide variation in the circular polarization fraction with some of the bursts being unpolarized while others having circular polarization fraction reaching up to 100% ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . at meter wavelengths",
    ", @xcite observed 40 to 60% circularly polarized emission in 8 cases from flare stars .",
    "@xcite reported observations of ad leo with circular polarization fraction of about 15% , and the emission properties were explained as electron cyclotron emission .",
    "reversal in the sense of circular polarization was also reported from the above flare star @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , mode coupling could prevent attainment of a high polarization , which could operate for the gcrt when the circular polarization fraction is small and also explain our observed polarization reversal in the data described above .    measured rotation period for stars",
    "show a decrease in rotation period towards lower mass ( 0.1 m@xmath0 ) objects reaching @xmath30.1 day ( e.g. in pleaides ) @xcite .",
    "a few of these ultracool dwarfs produce flares at radio frequencies @xcite . as in @xcite , within one rotation of the object , there could be two pulses of emission . if this is the case during the gcrt 2002 outbursts , its rotation period is @xmath30.1 day , consistent with the above finding .",
    "hence , an ultracool dwarf could be progenitor of the gcrt . @xcite",
    "have considered the object ` c ' as a possible progenitor of the gcrt .",
    "however , emission from an ultracool dwarf ( l4.5v ) do not produce a good fit to the observed multi - band photometry of the object c. we find the goodness of the fit do not change significantly ( rms error @xmath30.3 magnitude ) from @xcite results when the suggested k7v star is replaced by a @xmath30.1 m@xmath0 star @xmath30.1 gyr old @xcite .",
    "this could be a young mid to late m type of star with a@xmath45 @xmath33.5 , indicating it to be at a distance of @xmath34 kpc .",
    "such a distance matches the 10@xmath40k cyclotron brightness temperature limit ( radius @xmath30.15 r@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , considering the uncertainty ( @xmath30.1 magnitude ) in the ir magnitudes @xcite and in the theoretical model , the quality of the fit is marginal and object ` c ' is considered only as a candidate progenitor of the gcrt .",
    "we , however , note that a hithertho undetected ultracool dwarf located @xmath33200 pc @xcite could also be the progenitor of the gcrt .",
    "we have detected time - varying , highly circularly polarised emission from the gcrt j1745 - 3009 based on a re - analysis of its outburst on 28th september 2003 .",
    "the percentage of circular polarization approaching @xmath3100% commensurate with high brightness temperature ( @xmath2110@xmath29k for a source @xmath211 pc away ) significantly strengthens the original suggestion of a coherent emission scenario @xcite , but its properties are inconsistent with a pulsar origin .",
    "the time scale of change in sign of the circular polarization allows us to estimate an upper limit of 8 r@xmath46 on its size .",
    "based on its measured emission characteristics , either electron cyclotron maser or plasma emission processes could be the most plausible origin scenarios .    ascribing the 77 minute periodicity observed in its 2002 outbursts to half the rotation period of its progenitor , observed radio emission of the gcrt",
    "could be explained as outbursts from a highly subsolar flare star .",
    "its distance is estimated to be @xmath14 kpc .",
    "independent verification , would however , be required to confirm its progenitor .",
