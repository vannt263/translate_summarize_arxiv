    "<S> the final state in heavy - ion collisions has a higher degree of strangeness saturation than the one produced in collisions between elementary particles like @xmath0 or @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic analysis of this phenomenon is made for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 collisions at the cern sps collider and for @xmath5 collisions at rhic and at ags energies . </S>",
    "<S> strangeness saturation is shown to increase smoothly with the number of participants at ags , cern and rhic energies .    </S>",
    "<S> statistical - thermal models are able to fit the multiplicities measured in relativistic heavy - ion collisions with remarkable success @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a striking feature is that the freeze - out temperatures observed in @xmath0 , @xmath1 and in relativistic heavy - ion collisions are similar but the strangeness saturation is very different . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this difference and determine the thermal parameters as a function of the number of participants . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the strangeness saturation increases smoothly with the size of the system at all energies  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the the system size is deduced from 4@xmath6-yields measured in central @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions  @xcite , and centrality - binned @xmath4 collisions  @xcite at 158 agev at the cern - sps . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> results from centrality - binned mid - rapidity yields from @xmath5 collisions at @xmath7 gev  @xcite are also shown .    the baryon chemical potential , @xmath8 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cleymans_ps3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that @xmath8 shows no dependence at all on centrality both at sps and at rhic energies . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 and @xmath3 values are consistent with those obtained in @xmath4 at the same energy . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we indicate in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cleymans_ps3 ] the results obtained in a comprehensive analysis of all data at cern - sps  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the freeze - out temperature , @xmath9 , is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ t_syssize ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is again noticeable that @xmath9 shows almost no dependence on centrality both at sps and at rhic energies but the evidence is less pronounced than for @xmath8 . at rhic </S>",
    "<S> the evidence is compatible with a smooth increase in the temperature as the centrality increases . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> we indicate again the results of the comprehensive analysis of reference  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the clearest change in the thermodynamic parameters , as one changes the size of the system , is seen in the strangeness saturation factor  @xcite , @xmath10 , which shows a smooth linear increase with centrality in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 system , except for the two most central bins in @xmath4 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cleymans_ps3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems lie above the trend suggested by the @xmath4 points . </S>",
    "<S> this clearly indicates that peripheral @xmath4 collisions are not equivalent , with respect to strangeness saturation , to central collisions of lighter nuclei with the same participant number .    at this conference </S>",
    "<S> first results were presented by the e895 collaboration @xcite on @xmath11 and @xmath12 yields obtained in @xmath5 collisions at the ags . </S>",
    "<S> these data require both canonical corrections and a strangeness saturation which increases linearly with the number of participants , which was taken as @xmath13 , in rough agreement with the results from sps . </S>",
    "<S> the fit shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ e895la ] , [ e895ksi ] uses the freeze - out temperature and chemical potential obtained from the values as determined from the fit @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , the strangeness saturation factor , @xmath10 , increases with participant number in the @xmath4 system at the cern sps as well as the @xmath5 system at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> central collisions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 at sps energies deviate , with respect to strangeness saturation , from peripheral @xmath4 collisions . </S>"
