    "as a relativistic wave equation , the dirac equation provides naturally a description of an electron @xcite .",
    "following dirac s discovery of the linear equation of the electron , there appears the fundamental idea of nonlinear description of an elementary spin-1/2 particle which makes it possible to take into account its self - interaction @xcite .",
    "heisenberg put forward the idea to use a nonlinear dirac ( nld ) equation as a possible basis model for a unified field theory @xcite .",
    "a key feature of the nld equation is that it allows solitary wave solutions or particle - like solutions  the stable localized solutions with finite energy and charge @xcite .",
    "that is , the particles appear as intense localized regions of field which can be recognized as the basic ingredient in the description of extended objects in quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "different self - interactions give rise to different nld models mainly including the thirring model @xcite , the soler model @xcite , the gross - neveu model @xcite ( equivalent to the massless soler model ) , and the bag model @xcite ( _ _ i.e. _ _  the solitary waves with finite compact support ) , all of which attracted wide interest of physicists and mathematicians around the 1970s and 1980s , especially on looking for the solitary wave solutions and investigating the related physical and mathematical properties @xcite .    for the nld equation in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions ( _ _ i.e. _ _  one time dimension plus one space dimension ) ,",
    "several analytical solitary wave solutions are derived in @xcite for the quadric nonlinearity , @xcite for fractional nonlinearity as well as @xcite for general nonlinearity by using explicitly the constraint resulting from energy - momentum conservation , and summarized by mathieu @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are few explicit solutions in ( 1 + 3 ) dimensions except for some particular cases shown in @xcite in spite of their existence claimed by mathematicians for various situations @xcite ( the readers are referred to an overview @xcite on this topic ) , and most understanding is based on numerical investigations , _ _",
    "e.g. _ _  @xcite . beyond this , the study of the nld equation in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions could be very helpful for that in ( 1 + 3 ) dimensions since the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nld equation correspond to the asymptotic form of the equation in the physically interesting case of ( 1 + 3 ) dimensions as emphasized by kaus @xcite .",
    "that is , some qualitative properties of the nld solitary waves could be similar in such two cases .",
    "an interesting topic for the nld equation is the stability issue , which has been the central topic in works spread out over several decades in an effort that is still ongoing .",
    "analytical studies of the nld solitary wave stability face serious obstacles @xcite , while results of computer simulations are contradictory @xcite .",
    "the stability analysis of the nld solitary waves is still a very challenging mathematical problem to date @xcite .",
    "recent efforts in this direction can be found in @xcite .",
    "another rising mathematical interest related to the nld equation is the analysis of global well - posedness , _ _",
    "e.g. _ _  see @xcite and references therein .    in the case of that theoretical methods were not able to give the satisfactory results , numerical methods were used for obtaining the solitary wave solutions of the nld equation as well as for investigating the stability .",
    "an important step in this direction was made by alvarez and carreras in 1981 @xcite , who simulated the interaction dynamics between the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nld solitary waves of different initial charge for the soler model @xcite by using a second - order accurate crank - nicholson ( cn ) scheme @xcite .",
    "they first saw there : charge and energy interchange except for some particular initial velocities of the solitary waves ; inelastic interaction in binary collisions ; and oscillating state production from binary collisions .",
    "motivated by their work , shao and tang revisited this interaction dynamics problem in 2005 @xcite by employing a fourth - order accurate runge - kutta discontinuous galerkin ( rkdg ) method @xcite .",
    "they not only recovered the phenomena mentioned by alvarez and carreras but also revealed several new ones , _ _",
    "e.g. _ _  collapse in binary and ternary collisions of two - humped nld solitary waves @xcite ; a long - lived oscillating state formed with an approximate constant frequency in collisions of two standing waves @xcite ; full repulsion in binary and ternary collisions of out - of - phase waves @xcite .",
    "their numerical results also inferred that the two - humped profile could undermine the stability during the scattering of the nld solitary waves .",
    "note in passing that the two - humped profile was first pointed out by shao and tang @xcite and later gotten noticed by other researchers @xcite .",
    "besides the often - used cn @xcite and rkdg methods @xcite , there exist many other numerical schemes for solving the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional nld equation : split - step spectral schemes @xcite , the linearized cn scheme @xcite , the semi - implicit scheme @xcite@xcite , legendre rational spectral methods @xcite , multi - symplectic runge - kutta methods @xcite , adaptive mesh methods @xcite _ etc_. the fourth - order accurate rkdg method @xcite is very appropriate for investigating the interaction dynamics of the nld solitary waves due to their ability to capture the discontinuous or strong gradients without producing spurious oscillations , and thus performs better than the second - order accurate cn scheme @xcite . however , the high cost due to the relatively more freedoms used in each cell and the stringent time step constraint reduce its practicality in more realistic simulations where realtime and quantitative results are required .",
    "recently , there has been a remarkable upsurge of the interest in the nld models , as they emerge naturally as practical models in other physical systems , such as the gap solitons in nonlinear optics @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in honeycomb optical lattices @xcite , as well as matter influencing the evolution of the universe in cosmology @xcite . in view of such new trend ,",
    "longtime stable , efficient , conservative and high - order accurate numerical methods for solving the nld equation are highly desirable .",
    "finite difference methods , usually as the first try in practice , enable easy coding and debugging and thus are often used by physicists and engineers .",
    "however , detailed discussion and careful comparison on finite difference solvers for the nld equation are not existed . to this end , the present work as the first step will extendedly propose the finite deference schemes for solving the nld equation with the scalar and vector self - interaction .",
    "a general and precise comparison among them will be presented .",
    "however , all of these finite difference methods are often of the second order accuracy and thus sustain fast error growth with respect to time .",
    "to achieve relatively slow error growth , high - order accurate numerical methods are required . by exploiting the local conservation laws of the nld equation , we present exponential operator splitting ( os ) schemes which are time reversible and",
    "can conserve the discrete charge .",
    "one of the high - order accurate os schemes is afterwards adopted to investigate the interaction dynamics for the nld solitary waves under the general scalar and vector self - interaction .",
    "it should be noted that the experiments carried out in the literatures are all limited to the collisions of the nld solitary waves under the quadric scalar self - interaction . here , the binary collisions of the nld solitary waves under the cubic scalar self - interaction or under the vector self - interaction or under the linear combination of the scalar and vector self - interactions are all studied for the first time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "there is a brief review of the nld equation in section [ sec2:gnld ] and the solitary wave solutions are also derived there for the general scalar and vector self - interaction .",
