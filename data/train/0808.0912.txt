    "three - dimensional chern - simons ( cs ) gauge theories coupled to matter , with @xmath0 supersymmetry or higher , have recently attracted considerable attention , as prominent candidates for field theory duals of ads@xmath3 vacua of string and m - theory @xcite .",
    "the simplest examples of these vacua are freund - rubin ads@xmath8 solutions of eleven - dimensional supergravity , where @xmath9 is a sasaki - einstein seven - manifold ( or orbifold ) .",
    "such backgrounds are expected to be ads / cft dual to the field theory on a large number of m2-branes at a calabi - yau 4-fold singularity .",
    "one would then like to answer the question : what are the field theory duals of such solutions ?",
    "of course this hinges on the open problem of what are the degrees of freedom on the m2-branes .",
    "progress in this direction has been made in the recent work of @xcite ( abjm ) .",
    "the authors of the latter reference have identified the gauge theory duals of a class of ads@xmath10 backgrounds , showing that these are @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) chern - simons quivers with two nodes and chern - simons levels @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , the quiver itself is precisely the same as the 4d @xmath14 model of @xcite .",
    "the corresponding situation in type iib string theory is understood rather better . here",
    "one can construct large classes of @xmath1 ads@xmath15/cft@xmath3 duals by considering @xmath16 d3-branes placed at a conical calabi - yau 3-fold singularity @xmath17 .",
    "in many cases the gauge theory may be constructed from the open string degrees of freedom living on the ( fractional ) branes . in these examples",
    "the dual theory is described by a 4d @xmath14 quiver gauge theory .",
    "the moduli space of vacua of these theories contains a branch ( the mesonic branch ) which is a symmetric product of the calabi - yau singularity @xmath17 one started with . the gravity dual is then expected to be ads@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the sasaki - einstein base of the calabi - yau cone @xmath20 , thus closing the circle .",
    "the key difference with the m - theory set - up described in the paragraph above is that d - branes in string theory are currently understood in much greater detail than m - branes in m - theory .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the classical vacuum moduli spaces ( vms ) of @xmath0 chern - simons quiver gauge theories with arbitrary cs levels",
    ". these spaces in general may be rather complicated , containing several branches ( _ i.e. _ coulomb , higgs , or mixed branches ) .",
    "however , motivated by the situation in 4d and the cs quiver theory of @xcite , we will focus our attention on a particular branch of these theories . if the cs quiver theories we discuss indeed have an interpretation in terms of m2-branes at a cy 4-fold singularity , we believe it is this branch that should reproduce the cy 4-fold as the moduli space of the transverse m2-branes",
    ". for simplicity we will take all ranks of the gauge groups equal to @xmath16 and denote this by @xmath21 , although the results we describe may be easily generalised to the case of arbitrary ranks .",
    "we begin with the abelian theory @xmath22 .",
    "we show that the vms contains a branch that is closely related to the moduli space of a parent 4d @xmath1 quiver theory , in a sense that we shall explain more precisely during the course of the paper",
    ". in particular , when this parent quiver theory arises from a 3-fold singularity , for certain general choices of chern - simons levels the corresponding 3d theory has a branch of the moduli space which is a 4-fold singularity .",
    "the discussion is extended to the non - abelian theories with little modification .",
    "note that , _ a priori _ , it is not clear what are the conditions that a chern - simons quiver should satisfy in order to flow to a superconformal fixed point in the infra - red ( ir ) .",
    "the situation ought to be more subtle than is the case in four dimensions , where anomalies , nsvz beta - functions , and a - maximisation @xcite provide important constraints on the ir dynamics .    the results of this paper are a first key step towards identifying candidate @xmath0 conformal chern - simons quiver gauge theories with ads@xmath8 gravity duals . in particular , they suggest a general method for constructing 3d chern - simons quiver gauge theories arising from m2-branes at a given calabi - yau 4-fold singularity . as an application",
    ", we discuss a family of chern - simons quiver gauge theories that are candidate duals to an infinite family of explicit sasaki - einstein seven - manifolds , constructed in @xcite and further analysed in @xcite .",
    "the plan of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ lagrangians ]",
    "we recall the field content and lagrangian of @xmath0 chern - simons theories , with product gauge group and bifundamental matter , _",

    "we analyse the vms of abelian quivers .",
    "section [ nonabelian ] describes the extension to non - abelian gauge groups . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the relevance of our results for the construction of superconformal chern - simons quivers with ads@xmath3 duals .",
    "section [ examples ] presents an infinite family of chern - simons quiver gauge theories which are candidate ads@xmath3/cft@xmath4 duals to a corresponding family of explicit sasaki - einstein seven - manifolds .",

    "this is simply the dimensional reduction of the usual 4d @xmath1 vector multiplet . in particular",
    ", @xmath25 arises from the zero mode of the component of the vector field in the direction along which we reduce .",

    "in particular , they may be renormalised in the ir .",
    "the resemblance of these theories to @xmath43 @xmath1 theories should be apparent .",
    "notice , however , that there are no kinetic terms for the gauge fields , which are replaced by the cs terms .",
    "the fields in the vector multiplets are therefore auxiliary fields .",
    "recall that a quiver is a directed graph on @xmath44 nodes , with arrow set @xmath45 and head and tail maps @xmath46 .",
    "in general we associate a gauge group factor @xmath35 to node @xmath47 , with the chiral field @xmath29 transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group at node @xmath48 and the anti - fundamental representation of the gauge group at node @xmath49 .",
    "the gauge group is thus given by ( [ gaugegroup ] ) .",
    "the superpotential @xmath41 is constructed as the trace of a sum of closed oriented paths in the quiver .",
    "the coefficients in this sum are the ( classical ) superpotential couplings .",
    "we begin by specialising to the abelian case with @xmath50 for all @xmath37 , so that the gauge group is simply g = u(1)^n  .",

    "the f - term equations are simply = 0  .",
    "this defines an affine algebraic set = \\ { w = 0 } ^m  , where in the abelian case at hand @xmath63 .",
    "this is exactly as for 4d @xmath14 quiver gauge theories .",
    "we next turn to the d - term equations . again , since ( [ vodoo ] ) is a sum of non - negative terms , the potential is minimised at zero .",
    "one set of solutions is clearly given by [ equalvevs ] _",
    "1=_2==_n s  . here",
    "@xmath64 is arbitrary .",
    "as will become clear , this is an interesting branch of the moduli space , since the final result when the corresponding 4d quiver theory is dual to a 3-fold singularity will be a 4-fold singularity .",
    "in general there could be other branches , obtained by instead setting certain @xmath65 and thus allowing for more general @xmath57 .",
    "it is simple to write down examples of quivers which have such branches .",
    "however , we believe that for the quivers relevant for the ads@xmath3/cft@xmath4 correspondence , it is the above branch that should reproduce the cy 4-fold geometry as the moduli space of transverse m2-branes . in any case , we will not consider the other branches of the vms , if indeed there are any , in the present paper .",
    "the conditions ( [ dterms ] ) then become [ vmseqns ] _",
    "note then that ( [ sumcssigma ] ) implies [ sumcs ] _",
    "i=1^n k_i=0  .",
    "this is hence a necessary condition on the chern - simons levels for a chern - simons quiver theory to admit the above vacua with @xmath66 .",
    "if ( [ sumcs ] ) does not hold then @xmath67 is identically zero and note that we reduce to the usual 4d space of d - term equations with zero fi parameters .",
    "this would usually be called the higgs branch .",
    "indeed , the vms equations ( [ vmseqns ] ) may be regarded as promoting a 4d fi parameter to a vev .",
    "the fi parameter is @xmath68 , and thus the direction is determined by the vector of cs levels , while the scale is determined by the vev @xmath67 of the auxiliary scalars .",
    "thus , provided the vector @xmath69 and ( [ sumcs ] ) holds , the 3d space of absolute minima of the potential is always one real dimension higher than the 4d space of minima for the corresponding quiver theory .",
    "we may conveniently rewrite the 3d d - term equations ( [ vmseqns ] ) in a 4d language as follows .",
    "we begin by noting that the @xmath44-vector @xmath70 is , more invariantly , an element of the dual lie algebra @xmath71 of @xmath72 , so k_n^ *  .",
    "there is hence a kernel ( k)_n^n  , given by vectors that contracted with @xmath70 give zero .",
    "provided @xmath73 , this defines a vector subspace of dimension @xmath74",
    ". then the 3d d - term equations ( [ vmseqns ] ) may be written as [ bob ] _",
    "i=1^n v_i _",
    "i=0  , v(k )  .",
    "note that this gives the correct vms even when @xmath75 .",
    "also notice that the vector @xmath76 if ( [ sumcs ] ) holds . since the d - term for this vector , and only for this direction , is identically zero",
    ", we see that ( [ bob ] ) imposes @xmath77 linearly independent equations for @xmath78 satisfying ( [ sumcs ] ) .",
    "in fact from now on we assume the latter conditions to hold .      in vacuum the gauge fields",
    "are set to zero .",
    "constant gauge transformations therefore map vacua to vacua , and to compute the space of gauge - equivalent solutions we must also identify by these gauge transformations .",
    "we have already noted that the overall diagonal @xmath60 acts trivially , and thus naively it seems one should quotient the space of f - term and d - term solutions by the action of @xmath79 to obtain the vms .",
    "however , there is an immediate problem with this : the vms would then be odd - dimensional , which is incompatible with supersymmetry .",
    "the resolution of this apparent puzzle becomes clear on examining the cs action more carefully , precisely as in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we define a = _",
    "i=1^n a_i  , b = _",
    "i=1^n k_i a_i  , where we have introduced h = \\{k_i }  .",
    "the abelian cs action for the gauge fields @xmath80 is s_(a ) = _",
    "i=1^nk_ia_ia_i  .",
    "now consider making the simultaneous variations a_ia_i+  , i=1, ",
    ",n with @xmath81 an arbitrary one - form .",
    "this induces the variations _ a & = & n + _ b & = & 0 where the second equation follows from ( [ sumcs ] ) .",
    "the variation of the cs action is hence _",
    "i=1^n k_ia_i where note there are two terms to vary in each summand , but they give equal contributions after integrating by parts .",
    "we may rewrite this as _",
    "s_(a ) = b  .",
    "we thus conclude that [ bf ] s_(a ) = bf + s  , where we have defined @xmath82 , and by definition _",
    "since the overall @xmath60 decouples from the matter , we see that the first `` @xmath83 '' term in the action ( [ bf ] ) describes completely the action for the gauge field @xmath84 .",
    "we may thus introduce a lagrange multiplier [ lagrange ] s _",
    "= -f and treat @xmath85 , rather than @xmath84 , as the basic variable .",
    "integrating out @xmath85 then imposes b =  .",

    "_ i  , & & _",
    "i=1^n k_i_i= 0  . the gauge transformations ( [ gaugeai ] ) are precisely those that do not act on @xmath86 .",
    "the transformation ( [ gaugeb ] ) of @xmath86 instead arises from [ btrans ] a_ia_i + _",
    "i  , _ i=1^n k_i_i = h  .",
    "consider now the character [ character ] _ k & : & u(1)^nu(1 ) + & ; & ( ^i_1,  ,^i_n)(i_i=1^nk_i_i )  .",
    "the gauge transformation of @xmath86 in ( [ gaugeb ] ) thus maps to @xmath87 .",
    "this lies in the kernel of ( [ character ] ) if and only if [ hquotient ] = where @xmath88 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume for the moment that @xmath89 has period @xmath90 , then gauge fixing @xmath91 leaves a residual gauge symmetry in ( [ gaugeb ] ) that is precisely the same as ( [ hquotient ] ) .",
    "the transformations ( [ gaugeai ] ) also lie in the kernel of ( [ character ] ) of course .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath89 has period @xmath90 , we see that the group of constant gauge transformations acting on the vms is precisely the kernel of ( [ character ] ) .",
    "this defines an abelian group @xmath92 of rank @xmath74 .",
    "note that due to ( [ sumcs ] ) this contains the overall diagonal @xmath60 , which acts trivially .",
    "thus the effectively acting group of gauge symmetries is the quotient [ hgroup ] h_k = _ k / u(1 ) u(1)^n-2_h  .",
    "it thus remains to justify that the period of @xmath89 is indeed @xmath90 .",
    "as is well - known , the periodicity for @xmath89 is related to the flux quantisation condition on @xmath85 via the coupling ( [ lagrange ] ) . in the above vacua",
    "we have set all gauge fields to zero , and thus @xmath93 .",
    "however , since nothing is charged under the overall diagonal @xmath60 gauge group , one may in fact turn on a diagonal gauge field in the above vacua .",
    "to see this , note that with non - zero gauge fields but constant @xmath30 there is an additional term in the expression for energy _ a |_a|^2 ( a_h(a)-a_t(a))^2  .",
    "this comes directly from the kinetic term for the @xmath30 .",
    "thus , in euclidean signature , and on the branch we consider , the total energy of the vacuum vanishes if and only if @xmath94 , which is a diagonal flux . ] .",
    "note this is closely related to ( [ equalvevs ] ) .",
    "the quantisation condition on each @xmath95 is the usual dirac condition _",
    "f_i where @xmath96 is any two - cycle .",
    "if @xmath96 is a two - sphere in @xmath97 , such a flux would signify the presence of magnetic monopoles inside this two - sphere .",
    "since all @xmath95 are equal , we thus see that _ f n  , which then leads to a period of @xmath90 for @xmath89 .",
    "note that this analysis depends on the branch of the vacuum moduli space we are considering . on different branches ,",
    "the periodicity of @xmath89 may _ a priori _ be different .",
    "the 3d vms , or at least the branch satisfying ( [ equalvevs ] ) , is then the khler quotient of the space of f - term solutions @xmath98 by @xmath99 at moment map level zero : [ 3dvms ] _ ( k ) = //",
    "notice this moduli space is acted on by @xmath100 , and that a further khler quotient by this @xmath60 would produce the usual mesonic moduli space of the corresponding 4d theory [ 3to4 ] _ = _",
    "( k)// u(1 )  .",
    "indeed , if one introduces an fi parameter @xmath101 for this @xmath60 quotient , via ( [ 3to4 ] ) one obtains a family of mesonic moduli spaces @xmath102 , labelled by @xmath103 . as reviewed for example in @xcite , in general the space of fi parameters for a khler quotient is a fan , which is a set of convex polyhedral cones glued together along their boundary faces .",
    "inside each cone the quotient spaces are isomorphic as complex manifolds , but have an induced khler class that depends linearly on @xmath103 .",
    "as one moves from one cone to another along a boundary wall , the moduli space undergoes a form of small birational transformation called a flip . in the case at hand , the cs vector @xmath70 picks a particular real line through the origin in the space of fi parameters of the corresponding 4d @xmath14 theory , where we may interpret @xmath104 .",
    "thus the mesonic spaces for @xmath105 are all isomorphic , with a khler class depending linearly on @xmath103",
    ". this will be a ( partial ) resolution of the mesonic moduli space with @xmath106 .",
    "as one passes to @xmath107 the moduli space undergoes a flip , with again the moduli spaces for @xmath107 being all isomorphic and the khler class depending linearly on @xmath103 .",
    "thus the 3d vms ( [ 3dvms ] ) may be obtained by gluing this one - parameter family of 4d mesonic moduli spaces together , with the @xmath100 fibred over each mesonic space in the family .",
    "we also note that ( [ 3dvms ] ) may be viewed as a ( git ) quotient of @xmath98 by the complexified gauge group h_k^= ( ^*)^n-2_h  .",
    "in fact we may define @xmath108 as an affine variety via [ git ] _",
    "h_k^ [ ] ^h_k^  .",
    "the equivalence between the two descriptions is standard ",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "moduli spaces of quivers with relations were first introduced in @xcite . given a quiver with relations , the moduli spaces in @xcite are defined by first picking a character of the gauge group , precisely as in ( [ character ] ) , and then defining the holomorphic ( git ) quotient , with respect to this character @xmath109 , of the set @xmath98 satisfying the relations .",

    "it is straightforward to recover the results of @xcite from the above discussion .",
    "the quiver has @xmath110 nodes with four bifundamental fields , which are grouped into two pairs in conjugate representations of the gauge group @xmath111 .",
    "the vector of cs levels is @xmath13 , in the notation of @xcite , so @xmath112 . in this abelian case",
    "the superpotential is identically zero , and thus the space of f - term solutions is @xmath113 .",
    "moreover , the group ( [ hgroup ] ) is simply @xmath114 , and one obtains @xmath115 as the 3d vms .",
    "note in this example that there are certainly no other branches to the vms . a further quotient of this space . ] by the relative @xmath60 gives the conifold singularity , which is of course the mesonic moduli space of the 4d theory @xcite .",

    "when some of the eigenvalues become equal , note that this symmetry group becomes enhanced to a non - abelian group . by restricting to diagonal bifundamentals ( [ sol2i ] )",

    "note also that this moduli space is @xmath16 complex dimensions higher than the mesonic moduli space , compared to 1 complex dimension higher for the branch discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "it seems reasonable , given the discussion above , that the various branches that generally exist inbetween these two extremes have relative dimensions between 1 and @xmath16 , and thus the branch ( [ nvms ] ) is in fact the highest dimensional branch of the full vms .",

    "the full vms appears to be quite a complicated object in general .",

    "the results we have discussed so far in this paper are rather general : we have discussed the classical vacuum moduli spaces of @xmath0 cs quivers , where the bifundamental matter and superpotential are arbitrary . when the chern - simons quiver arises from a parent 4d quiver gauge theory dual to a 3-fold singularity , namely the matter content and interactions of the 3d theory are formally the same as those of the 4d theory , our results imply that the vms contains ( the symmetric product of ) a complex four - dimensional branch of the corresponding baryonic moduli space .",
    "more precicisely , we have found that a necessary condition for such supersymmetric vacua to exist is that the sum of the cs levels vanishes _",
    "i=1^n k_i = 0  .",
    "[ itsnew ]    the space @xmath143 of f - term solutions is in general a fairly complicated object , with several branches of different dimension . for the class of 4d quiver gauge theories arising from d3-branes at toric calabi - yau singularities ,",
    "this space has recently been studied . ] in @xcite . in the latter reference",
    "it is shown that in these examples , with @xmath22 , @xmath143 is a complex @xmath144-dimensional affine toric variety .",
    "moreover , there exists a particular branch ( the irreducible component ) , that is argued to be itself an affine calabi - yau toric variety .",
    "this may be described as a khler quotient at level zero @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is a number determined from the data of the quiver .",
    "the mesonic moduli space of the theory is obtained by performing a further khler quotient , and results in the calabi - yau 3-fold _ 4d = ^z//u(1)^n-1  . taking the same quiver and replacing the kinetic terms for the gauge fields with chern - simons terms with cs level vector @xmath147 obeying ( [ itsnew ] ) ,",
    "we obtain instead a branch of the 3d vms , namely _",

    "thus , in particular , the subgroup @xmath99 preserves this volume form also .",
    "ultimately , we are interested in conformal field theories . these are candidate gauge theory duals of ads@xmath3 vacua of string or m - theory .",
    "such cfts , however , will generically be strongly coupled . ] , and at present there are no techniques available to perform independent field theory calculations .",
    "note this is different from four dimensions , where a - maximisation @xcite is an important tool for testing the existence of conjectured ir fixed points . using the ads / cft correspondence , the issue of conformal invariance in the ir may be translated into the question of whether the theory has an ads@xmath8 gravity dual , where @xmath9 is a sasaki - einstein seven - manifold .",
    "these backgrounds arise as the near - horizon limit of a large number of m2-branes , placed at the singularity of the calabi - yau cone @xmath151 .",
    "thus , a necessary condition for this situation to hold is that the 3d gauge theory contains this calabi - yau 4-fold as a ( generic ) component of its vms .",
    "this suggests that ( [ itsnew ] ) is in fact a necessary condition for conformal invariance .",
    "however , there may be additional conditions , yet to be discovered , that a chern - simons quiver gauge theory should satisfy in order to flow to a dual conformal fixed point in the ir .",
    "understanding these conditions is clearly an interesting direction for future research .",
    "notice that different theories may lead to the same moduli space @xmath152 .",
    "this may sound surprising at first , but one should bear in mind that this phenomenon already exists in 4d . there , seiberg duality implies that different gauge theories all flow to the same conformal field theory in the ir .",
    "in fact , instead of thinking of gauge theory duals of some ads@xmath15 solution , we should more precisely think of classes of seiberg - dual gauge theories .",
    "similar dualities exist for 3d theories ",
    "see @xcite for a recent discussion . however , we are led to consider the possibility that for appropriate values of the chern - simons levels , ( infinite ) families of 4d quivers ( _ e.g. _ the @xmath153 quivers @xcite ) , may all have the same ads@xmath3 duals , when viewed as 3d chern - simons quivers .",
    "it is unclear to us whether this will actually be the case , or rather further analysis will reveal that these quivers do not flow to conformal field theories in three dimensions .",
    "it will be interesting to analyse this further .",
    "the results discussed here lead to a simple general method for constructing candidate 3d @xmath2 superconformal chern - simons quivers with ads@xmath3 gravity duals , using well - developed 4d techniques .",
    "we illustrate this in the following section .",
    "in this final section we discuss a simple class of examples of the construction described in this paper .",
    "these are candidate gauge theory duals of the explicit sasaki - einstein metrics presented in @xcite .",
    "other examples may be treated in a similar manner ",
    "we briefly comment on various simple extensions at the end of the paper .",
    "recall from @xcite that the @xmath154 metrics enjoy an @xmath155 isometry , and that the corresponding calabi - yau cones are described by a glsm on @xmath156 , with a set of @xmath60 charges characterised by two integers .",
    "these properties motivate considering a quiver gauge theory with 3 nodes and @xmath157 symmetry .",
    "as we shall see , this seemingly naive hypothesis leads to a consistent picture .",
    "we thus begin with the 4d quiver gauge theory that is ads@xmath15/cft@xmath3 dual to the orbifold @xmath158 , where the @xmath159 is embedded along the hopf @xmath60 .",
    "equivalently , this is the theory on @xmath16 d3-branes placed at the singularity of the canonical complex cone over @xmath160 , which is the orbifold @xmath161 .",
    "the quiver has 3 nodes , with a @xmath162 gauge group at each node , and 9 bifundamental fields , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , going from nodes 1 to 2 , 2 to 3 , and 3 to 1 , respectively .",
    "this is shown in figure [ quiverpic ] .",
    "the superpotential takes the @xmath157-invariant form w = _",
    "ijk(x_iy_jz_k )  .",
    "the f - term equations @xmath167 are hence [ fterms ] x_iy_j = x_jy_i  , y_iz_j = y_jz_i  , z_ix_j= z_jx_i  .",
    "notice the equations with @xmath168 are redundant .",
    "henceforth we set @xmath22 , so that the bifundamental vevs are simply coordinates on @xmath169 .",
    "since the equations ( [ fterms ] ) set one monomial equal to another monomial , it is a standard result that the affine variety @xmath170 is a toric variety  see , for example , @xcite .",

    "however , to compute the moduli space of the 3d cs theory we instead quotient by the kernel of the map [ mappy ] ( ^*)^3 ( _ 1,_2,_3 ) _ 1^k_1_2^k_2_3^k_3^ *  .",
    "this kernel , after dividing by the diagonal @xmath172 which acts trivially , is isomorphic to @xmath183 , where @xmath184 . for simplicity",
    "we begin by choosing the cs levels so that @xmath185 .",

    "this determines a @xmath172 action on @xmath98 , which we may lift to an action on @xmath173 by assigning charges @xmath194 to the coordinates @xmath195 on @xmath173 .",
