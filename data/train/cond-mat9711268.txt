    "the effect of tunneling is well studied in the context of quantum mechanics ( see , for example , book @xcite ) .",
    "recently , tunneling of electromagnetic waves has attracted interest owing to experiments with evanescent electromagnetic waves , @xcite which are a direct analog of wave functions of tunneling quantum particles .",
    "these experiments provide an opportunity to experimentally study the time evolution of tunneling wave packets  a subject of long - standing controversy ( see , for example , review articles @xcite ) .",
    "so far , three types of optical barriers have been considered in the context of the tunneling experiments .",
    "historically , the first experiment with evanescent modes was carried out by bose in 1927 , where a prism with a beam incident at an angle larger then the angle of total internal reflection was used as a barrier @xcite .",
    "the same idea was used by yeh @xcite , who considered resonant tunneling of electromagnetic waves in a superlattice composed of alternating layers with indexes of refraction such that the incident angle was greater then the angle of total internal reflection for one layer and smaller for the other one .",
    "the majority of time - of - flight theoretical considerations and experiments have been performed for an undersized wave guide @xcite , and photonic band gaps.@xcite all of the considered optical barriers were artificial structures .",
    "however , there exist natural optical barriers , which are well known , but were never considered in the context of light tunneling .",
    "we are referring to `` restrahlen '' or `` stop '' photonic bands , which exist in many dielectrics and semiconductors in the region of polariton resonances .",
    "it is well known that in the absence of attenuation , the transmission coefficient of light with a frequency within the stop band decreases exponentially with an increase in the width of a slab through which it propagates .",
    "therefore , a simple slab of a dielectric with polariton resonances can serve as a `` naturally made '' photonic barrier .",
    "properties of this polariton barrier , however , might be considerably different from properties of other kinds of barriers because of the different dispersion law of electromagnetic waves tunneling through the polariton barrier .",
    "it is important , therefore , to consider the tunneling properties of polariton barriers .    in this paper",
    "we consider tunneling of electromagnetic radiation through a polariton barrier in a steady state mode .",
    "the point of interest in this situation is the resonance tunneling through a two - barrier system .",
    "resonance tunneling of electromagnetic waves in a superlattice structure was previously discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a tunneling effect in ref.@xcite arose when the angle of incidence for electromagnetic waves exceeded the angle of total internal reflection for one of the layers constituting the superlattice .",
    "the frequency dependence of the imaginary wave number in this case coincides with that of the square - barrier quantum tunneling problem .",
    "the situation considered in this paper is considerably different . the imaginary wave number in a polariton barrier layer depends upon the frequency in a peculiar way , demonstrating a singularity near the lower boundary , @xmath0 , of the polariton gap .",
    "this dependence does not have an analog in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "this leads to a new pattern of resonance tunneling states .    extending our system from two - barrier to a periodic array of alternating transparent and barrier layers , we obtain a new kind of photon band _ inside the initial forbidden band_. these bands arise from the tunneling states and inherit many of their properties .",
    "in particular , we show that the bandwidths of these bands are determined by the widths of the respective resonances .",
    "the band structure of 2-d and 3-d photonic crystals made of materials with frequency dependent dielectric permeability was numerically studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite computed bands of two and three dimensional structures composed of metal rods ( spheres in the 3-d case ) with dielectric permeability of the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency of plasma excitations in the metal .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite dealt with a photonic crystal built of a dielectric with @xmath3 similar to that used in the present paper [ see eq.([epsilon ] ) below ] .",
    "one of the interesting effects observed in both studies was flattening of the photonic bands below the frequency @xmath4 , in the case considered in ref.@xcite , or below @xmath5 for ref.@xcite .",
    "we show analytically that this effect in the case of the dielectric photonic crystal is a direct consequence of the singular behavior of the dielectric function at @xmath0 .",
    "we also discuss the influence of absorption upon tunneling properties of the polariton barriers .",
    "we consider propagation of electromagnetic radiation of frequency @xmath6 in a system that consists of two parallel absorbing dielectric layers , each of thickness @xmath7 , positioned along the @xmath8-axis and separated by a distance @xmath9 .",
    "the dielectric permeability of the dielectric material is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the attenuation , and @xmath12 is the background dielectric permeability .",
    "both layers are considered optically isotropic , so that te and tm waves are not coupled .",
    "this allows us to neglect the vector nature of the electric field .",
    "we consider the case of normal incidence so that the electric field in our system can be presented as follows :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the wave - vector in vacuum , @xmath15 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the complex amplitudes of the plane waves in each of the five different regions .",
    "the wave number @xmath24 in the dielectric layers is determined by the expression following from eq.([epsilon ] ) : @xmath25    taking into account regular boundary conditions at each of the boundaries between different materials , we obtain the following expression for the complex transmission coefficient @xmath23 : @xmath26 ^{-1}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of a lossless dielectric ( @xmath27 ) the expression for the transmissivity of the system , @xmath28 can be obtained as @xmath29 } ,   \\label{t}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is given by    @xmath31 = \\cosh ( \\kappa a)\\cos ( k_{0}b)+\\frac{1}{2}\\left (   \\frac{\\kappa } { k_{0}}-\\frac{k_{0}}{\\kappa } \\right ) \\sinh ( \\kappa a)\\sin ( k_{0}b ) .   \\label{k}\\ ] ]    we assume here that the frequency of the wave falls into the region @xmath32 so that the wave number @xmath33 is imaginary , and propagation of the wave through the dielectric layers is evanescent .",
    "eq.([t ] ) describes optical tunneling through a forbidden `` band . ''",
    "however , for a set of frequencies such that @xmath31 = 0 ,   \\label{resonance}\\ ] ] the transmission coefficient , @xmath34 , is equal to @xmath35 , and tunneling through the system becomes resonant .",
    "though eq.([k ] ) is similar to the respective equations of ref.@xcite and of the quantum mechanics tunneling problem , the different frequency dependence of the wave number @xmath24 causes different behavior of the solutions to this equation .    in order to determine the number of resonance frequencies ,",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eq.([resonance ] ) as @xmath36 if boundary frequencies @xmath37 and @xmath0 satisfy the inequality @xmath38 the respective interval of wave numbers form @xmath39 to @xmath40 can only accommodate less than one period of @xmath41 . in this case eq.([solution ] ) has one solution if @xmath42 if inequality([inequality ] ) does not hold , the number of resonance frequencies is equal to @xmath43 if inequality([onesolution ] ) is satisfied , and it is @xmath44 otherwise .",
    "the transmission , @xmath34 , as a function of frequency is presented in figs.1 for two different values of the widths of the layers @xmath7 and @xmath45 .",
    "one can see that as the ratio of @xmath7 to @xmath45 increases , so does the number of resonant peaks .",
    "both plots in fig.1 show a similar pattern : the separation between resonant peaks remains approximately constant while the half - width @xmath46 of peaks sharply decreases as the frequency approaches @xmath0 .",
    "the resonant half - width , @xmath47 can be found by expanding the denominator of eq.([t ] ) near the resonance frequency @xmath48 up to the term quadratic in @xmath49 .",
    "if a resonance frequency , @xmath50 is close to the lower boundary of the gap , @xmath51 , one can find for @xmath52 @xmath53 , }   \\label{gammaleft}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "( [ gammaleft ] ) describes an extremely sharp non - analytical behavior of the width of the resonance near the low - frequency boundary of the gap .    to take absorption into account",
    ", one can replace the parameter @xmath56 by the following expression @xmath57 if @xmath58 the width of the resonance becomes proportional to @xmath59 and remains small for @xmath60 .",
    "however , the width grows exponentially fast with an increase of the absorption rate , and the height of the peak decreases correspondingly .",
    "therefore , the resonances nearest to @xmath0 are the most vulnerable with respect to absorption .",
    "one can see this in fig.2 , which shows that these resonances disappear first when the absorption becomes larger .",
    "it also follows from this analysis that the width of the resonance peaks close to @xmath0 is determined solely by absorption .",
    "this behavior of the resonances is specific to our particular model and does not take place in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the wave - vector is finite for any @xmath6 in the forbidden band .",
    "when @xmath61 approaches @xmath37 , the wave - vector @xmath62 becomes smaller and @xmath52 increases with frequency , reaching at @xmath63 a certain value , which depends upon all the parameters of the system . for these frequencies ,",
    "absorption , when small enough , does not contribute significantly to the width of the maxima .",
    "in the case of a periodic array of the three - layer sandwiches considered in the previous section of the paper , one has a set of propagating bands instead of single resonance frequencies .",
    "in this situation , eq.([k ] ) presents the dispersion equation of the propagating modes with @xmath64 being the bloch wave number .",
    "the resonant tunneling frequencies discussed in the previous section are the solutions of the dispersion equation at the center of the brillouin band , @xmath65 , where @xmath64 changes between @xmath66 and @xmath67 within the band .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that each of the resonances gives rise to a corresponding band .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the dispersion curves plotted in figs .",
    "3 . one can see from this figure that for each resonant frequency @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the number of a given mode , there is a distinct branch of the dispersion curve .",
    "it is interesting to note that branches corresponding to the resonant frequencies close to @xmath0 , have much smaller dispersion than branches which correspond to @xmath70 .",
    "one can also notice that regular bands , which appear outside of the polariton gap , also become less dispersive for frequencies near @xmath0 .",
    "this observation agrees with the results reported in ref.@xcite for two - dimensional systems .",
    "the advantage of the one - dimensional model is that we can analytically determine the cause for this behavior .",
    "assuming that the width of a band , centered at @xmath68 , is much smaller then the frequency itself , one can expand the right - hand side of the dispersion equation ( [ k ] ) with respect to @xmath71 and obtain the approximate dispersion equation as follows : @xmath72 \\cos \\left [ k(a+b)\\right ] .",
    "\\label{dispersionappr}\\ ] ] if one combines this equation and eq.([gammaleft ] ) for the resonance width @xmath52 , the expression for the band width , @xmath73 , for bands near the lower edge @xmath74 becomes    @xmath75 this expression also holds for frequencies at the pass - band side of @xmath51 and explains , therefore , the flattening of the photon dispersion curves near @xmath0 observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "both the band width @xmath73 and the width of the resonance @xmath52 tend to a certain finite value when @xmath6 approaches @xmath37 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath76 in eq.([dispersionappr ] ) shows that the branches have an alternating sign of the dispersion : positive for the `` even '' branches and negative for the `` odd '' ones .",
    "this feature is clearly seen in fig.3 .",
    "we consider a polariton stop - band ( restrahlen region ) as an optical barrier for tunneling of electromagnetic waves .",
    "we show that the peculiar frequency dependence of the tunneling penetration length of electromagnetic waves results in tunneling properties that are qualitatively different from those of other optical barriers .",
    "we carry out a detailed study of the resonant tunneling of electromagnetic waves through a three - layer sandwich , where a dispersionless ( vacuum ) layer was placed between two identical layers with dielectric permeability allowing for the polariton stop - band .",
    "it was found that the number of resonance frequencies depends upon the frequency width of the stop - band , @xmath77 and the spacial width , @xmath78 of the vacuum layer .",
    "this number increases with an increase of @xmath79 and @xmath45 .",
    "the latter dependence appears paradoxical , since it implies that no matter how far away tunneling layers are from each other , they are capable of providing conditions for resonant tunneling .",
    "the situation becomes clear if one recollects that we deal with the steady state situation , where the flux of energy in the system is fixed by an external source . for a large system ,",
    "a wave has to travel a long distance between the layers before it reaches the steady state condition .",
    "this fact is crucial for an experimental observation of resonance tunneling since one has to have a steady enough source of light and be able to maintain a complete coherency of the wave while it travels between the layers .",
    "let us consider , for example , @xmath80 , for which @xmath81 , and @xmath82@xcite .",
    "the vacuum wavelength in this case changes between @xmath83 and @xmath84 when frequency sweeps over the polariton gap .",
    "if one makes the distance @xmath45 between the layers equal to , say , @xmath85 ( approximately ten wavelengths ) , then the number of observable resonances would be equal to @xmath35 or @xmath86 depending upon the width of the dielectric layers . in order to observe greater number of the resonance one could use materials with wider polariton gaps , for example , @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89@xcite . in this case even for @xmath45 as small as @xmath90 , four resonance peaks could be observed .",
    "the actual number of resonance maxima also depends upon relaxation characteristics of the layers . though these characteristics can vary even for different samples of the same type of material",
    ", one can consider @xmath91 @xcite as a typical value and use it for quantitative estimates .",
    "it is seen from fig.2 that the relaxation of this order of magnitude could reduce the number of observable resonances by at most one maximum if the configuration of the system allows for a maximum near @xmath0 .",
    "more specific conclusions regarding the number of the expected resonances could be drawn from the results of the paper for each particular experimental configuration .",
    "the width of the resonance peaks of the transmission coefficient was found to have a sharp nonanalytical frequency dependence at the lower boundary of the polariton gap , @xmath0 and to saturate at a certain finite value when approaching the upper boundary , @xmath37 .",
    "this fact results in different reactions to absorption for resonances occurring in vicinities of @xmath5 and @xmath37 . in the first situation",
    "even a small absorption completely determines the real width of the resonance , and these resonances are washed out first with an increase of absorption .",
    "the resonances in the latter case survive much stronger rate of absorption , and for a small one they have a width mainly determined by the properties of the barrier itself .",
    "we also consider extension of our system to a periodic arrays of the sandwiches .",
    "we show that each of the resonances of the original system gives rise to a band , with the original resonance frequency at the center of the respective band .",
    "the band widths of the bands ( and correspondingly their degrees of dispersion ) are found to be determined by the frequency width of the respective parent resonances",
    ". this fact explains flattening photonic bands near @xmath0 observed previously in numerical simulations of 2-d systems@xcite .",
