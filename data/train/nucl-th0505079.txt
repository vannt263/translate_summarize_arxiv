    "a study of the elastic @xmath1-scattering is an important source of information about the internal structure of the proton . due to the smallness of the fine structure constant , @xmath2 , the first order perturbation term ( the one - photon exchange )",
    "is assumed to give a main contribution to the electromagnetic transition amplitude . in the one - photon approximation",
    "the elastic @xmath1-scattering is described by two quantities , the electric , @xmath3 , and magnetic , @xmath4 , form factors .",
    "the form factors @xmath5 and @xmath6 are usually extracted from cross section data by the rosenbluth separation method .",
    "the database for @xmath5 and @xmath6 obtained by this method shows that the ratio @xmath7 is approximately constant .",
    "recently new precise measurements of the ratio @xmath7 were done at jefferson lab @xcite by the recoil polarization method @xcite and yield significantly different results than the rosenbluth separation method @xcite .    because both measurements are based on the one - photon exchange approximation it is natural to assume that this discrepancy may be explained by the second order perturbation term in the @xmath8 expansion .",
    "the @xmath9 perturbation term should result in many effects .",
    "its real part contributes to the cross - section and destroys the rosenbluth formula .",
    "the imaginary part appears in one - particle polarization observables of the elastic @xmath1-scattering , the target and beam spin asymmetry , which vanish in the one - photon approximation .",
    "the present experimental technique makes possible to measure such observables and thus to take under control effects beyond the one - photon approximation .",
    "the aim of the present paper is a calculation of the target spin normal asymmetry in the elastic @xmath1-scattering at electron lab .",
    "energy @xmath10 .",
    "the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude , which determines the asymmetry , is simply related ( through the unitarity condition ) to the electroproduction amplitudes of different hadronic states .",
    "the so - called `` elastic '' contribution ( i.e. when the hadronic intermediate state , entering the unitarity condition , is the proton ) to the asymmetry was calculated in @xcite . in",
    "@xcite authors got strict bounds on the `` inelastic '' part of the asymmetry using the schwartz inequality .",
    "but , as the authors noted themselves , those bounds highly overestimate the actual values of the asymmetry , especially at high scattering angles .    in the recent work @xcite the asymmetry",
    "was calculated with @xmath11 and @xmath12 intermediate states .",
    "such approach gives a reasonable approximation at low electron energies , but becomes worse as the energy increases .",
    "contrary to @xcite , we will calculate the contribution of the resonances in the intermediate state , namely , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , using their experimental electroproduction amplitudes .",
    "such approach may be justified at intermediate energy , @xmath182  gev . for",
    "the large momentum transfer region parton model calculations would be more adequate @xcite .",
    "it was noted in @xcite , that the single - spin asymmetry is sensitive to the electroproduction amplitudes in a wide range of photon virtualities , and this may be a new way to access resonance transition form factors .",
    "the results of the present work may be useful in planning of such experiments .",
    "the paper in organized as follows . in section  [ sec : general ] we derive general formalism for the asymmetry , in sections  [ sec : res ]  and  [ sec : fit ] we explain how we describe the resonances and fit their electromagnetic transition amplitudes . numerical results and conclusions",
    "are given section  [ sec : results ] .",

    "( see figure  [ figefs ] ) one has @xmath42 here @xmath43 , @xmath44 - some hadronic state , @xmath45 - its spin and parity , @xmath46 - spin projection onto the vector @xmath47 .",
    "the quantities @xmath48 can be considered as helicity amplitudes of the process @xmath49 .",
    "+    polarization vectors of a virtual ( space - like ) photon @xmath50 are defined according to @xcite . in the coordinate frame of figure  [ figefs ]",
    "they are @xmath51 where the upper index of @xmath52 shows the spin projection onto the @xmath53axis .    if the coordinate system is oriented arbitrarily , so that @xmath54 , then @xmath55 orthogonality relations @xmath56      the name `` target normal asymmetry '' corresponds to the situation when the _ target _ proton is polarized along the _ normal _ to the reaction plane , and other particles are unpolarized . under such condition",
    "the proton spin has two possible directions , say , above and below the reaction plane .",
    "its invariant spin 4-vector should be either collinear or anti - collinear with 4-vector @xmath57 which is orthogonal to all momenta and satisfies @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding cross - sections , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are equal in the one - photon approximation , so the difference between them is due to higher order perturbative terms .",
    "the target normal asymmetry is defined as dimensionless ratio @xmath61 the asymmetry is proportional to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude .",

    "as it was shown in @xcite using ( [ unit2 ] ) and the time - reversal symmetry of the electromagnetic interaction , the asymmetry can be written as @xmath72 in the first non - vanishing order of @xmath8 , where @xmath73 is defined in ( [ jproton ] ) , @xmath74 @xmath75 and the hadronic tensor @xmath76 is defined as @xmath77 here @xmath78 are all possible hadronic states , which we will refer to as `` intermediate states '' .",

    "@xmath81 is the short - hand notation for @xmath82 where @xmath11 is the total number of particles , @xmath83 are their momenta .",
    "now we will express the hadronic tensor @xmath76 through the electroproduction helicity amplitudes @xmath84 .",
    "consider this tensor in the rest frame of the hadronic state @xmath78 , i.e. at @xmath85 .",
    "we choose coordinate system so that both vectors @xmath47 and @xmath86 lie in the @xmath87-plane ( see figure [ figbeta ] ) , and the angle between them is @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the sum @xmath81 can be split into 2 parts : first , the sum over total angular momentum ( = spin ) projections , second , the sum over all remaining quantum numbers , which we denote @xmath90 .",
    "the behaviour of the state @xmath78 with respect to spatial rotations is completely described by its spin and spin projection , and does not depend on any other quantum numbers .",
    "thanks to this fact , the sum over spin projections can be done explicitly : @xmath91 here @xmath92 denotes the state with the spin projection onto vector @xmath93 equal to @xmath46 .",
    "wave functions of these states are related via wigner d - functions @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 are polar angles of the vector @xmath47 and @xmath97 is the spin of the state @xmath78 . using ( [ wf ] ) and properties of d - functions we have @xmath98 using also amplitudes definition ( [ efs ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are polarization vectors of the 1st ( @xmath102 ) and 2nd ( @xmath103 ) photons of eq.([unit2 ] ) , defined according to ( [ polar ] ) .",
    "after that the asymmetry becomes @xmath104 where @xmath105    the quantities @xmath106 can be calculated explicitly ( provided the proton form factors are known ) , and the only unknown in ( [ asy3 ] ) are electromagnetic transition amplitudes @xmath84 .",
    "obviously , it is practically impossible to take into account @xmath107 allowed intermediate states . to proceed further , we need to restrict these states somehow .",
    "the authors of @xcite , for example , included only @xmath11 and @xmath12 states .",
    "although below the @xmath79 threshold ( @xmath108 ) such approach gives an exact result , one can expect that as the energy increases , this approximation becomes worse , since more intermediate states ( e.g. @xmath80 , @xmath109 ) will be possible .",
    "in the present paper we use another way to model the intermediate states .",
    "we treat them as a number of resonances and neglect the non - resonant continuum contribution . at present",
    "we can not estimate the non - resonant contribution well enough , but we can give qualitative arguments that it is small .    at a glance",
    "one may conclude that the relative size of the non - resonant contribution will be approximately the same as in inelastic cross - sections or structure functions .",
    "but actually it is likely to be much smaller for the following reason .",
    "contrary to strictly positive quantities , such as cross - sections , the asymmetry can have either sign .",
    "thus the contributions from different non - resonant states will mostly cancel each other .",
    "this is similar to the fact that the average of many uncorrelated random quantities has much smaller dispersion that each of them .    at @xmath110",
    "the hadronic tensor @xmath111 , which was introduced in previous section , turns into the hadronic tensor of inelastic @xmath1-scattering .",
    "it is natural to assume that the qualitative properties of both tensors are similar , so we should first look what resonances contribute to the inelastic @xmath1-scattering",
    ".    there are three prominent resonant peaks in the inelastic @xmath1 cross - section : the so - called 1-st , 2-nd and 3-rd resonance regions .",
    "the first resonance peak is due to the @xmath112-resonance ( @xmath13 ) , the second peak consists of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "there are many resonances which contribute to the third resonance region , but there are serious arguments ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the dominant contribution comes from @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , it is the only one , for which the transition amplitudes are known .",
    "although the roper resonance @xmath17 does not contribute significantly to the inelastic @xmath1-scattering @xcite , we also included it in our calculations .    for the proton in the intermediate state one",
    "has @xmath113 the resonance , however , has a mass @xmath114 and some finite width @xmath115 , so we `` spread '' @xmath116-function with the relativistic breit - wigner formula : @xmath117 after that the expression @xmath118 , entering the formula for asymmetry , will take the form @xmath119 the first part is the `` elastic '' ( proton ) contribution ; in the second part the sum runs over all resonances taken into account .",
    "the quantities @xmath120 depend only on @xmath121 but not @xmath122 .",
    "they are related to commonly used @xcite @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 as @xmath126 where @xmath127 , while for the proton they are @xmath128 which is easy to derive comparing ( [ jproton ] ) and ( [ efs ] ) .    for our calculation",
    "we use experimental data on @xmath129 ( i.e. @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) given in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are no data on @xmath125 for @xmath14 and @xmath16 , so in our calculations we set it to zero .    to evaluate the asymmetry we need to fit these data somehow .",
    "the fitting procedure is described in the next section .",
    "masses and widths of resonances were taken from pdg @xcite .",
    "the proton form factors were modelled using the well - known dipole fit @xmath130 where @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the proton magnetic moment .",
    "now consider the fit of electroproduction amplitudes . according to quark model prediction",
    "the high @xmath134 behaviour of the transition amplitudes should be like @xmath135 @xcite .    for the proton we have @xmath136 the denominator ( dipole formula )",
    "is entirely due to quark structure , while the numerator is just a kinematical factor .",
    "but the fact that @xmath124 tends to zero as @xmath137 is the specific feature of the proton . for the other hadronic states @xmath138 , so like @xcite and for the same reasons we introduce factor @xmath139 and assume , instead of ( [ egproton ] ) , @xmath140 so , to obtain correct asymptotic behaviour of @xmath124 at @xmath141 and @xmath142 , it is useful to fit the function @xmath143 which has finite values at both @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the same can be stated for @xmath125 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath123 has another asymptotic behaviour ( @xmath146 ) , therefore we would have used @xmath147 instead of @xmath148 in expressions like ( [ asymp ] ) and ( [ atilde ] ) for @xmath123 .",
    "however the @xmath134 values needed for our calculation are not too high . since @xmath149 , where @xmath96 is the c.m .",
    "scattering angle , one gets @xmath150 at @xmath151 .",
    "trying different parameterizations , we found that better agreement with the experimental data in the range @xmath152 , especially for delta , is achieved if we use the same formulae @xmath153 for all amplitudes .",
    "thus we fit the functions @xmath154 to describe high @xmath134 behaviour better , we treat @xmath155 as a function of @xmath156 instead of @xmath134 . at low @xmath134",
    "it does not matter , since @xmath157 , but the advantage is that @xmath158 is finite at @xmath159 , so we can use simple linear or polynomial fit for all @xmath158 values .    in our calculations",
    "we restrict ourselves to the linear least - squares fit of the form @xmath160 results of the fit are summarized in table 1 .",

    "it is quite obvious for the low energy , because the energy is insufficient for resonances to be produced .",

    "as was discussed in introduction , the asymmetry depends on the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "but since the real and imaginary parts are connected ( via the dispersion relations ) , we may expect that the _ real _ part will also be defined mostly by proton contribution .",

    "this quantity gives a direct information about the imaginary part of the reaction scattering amplitude and comes from the second and higher order perturbative terms .    to calculate the imaginary part of the amplitude we used unitarity and saturated the intermediate hadron states by the proton ( the so - called elastic contribution ) and the resonances from the first , second and third resonance regions ( the inelastic contribution ) .",
