    "in the optical continuum , qso 2237 + 0305 is a gravitational mirage that consists of four compact components ( a - d ) round the nucleus of the deflector ( lens galaxy ) .",
    "the light bundles corresponding to the components are passing through the bulge of the lens galaxy , and thus , if the galactic mass at the qso image positions is mainly in stars , the optical depths to microlensing are as high as @xmath5 ( e.g. , schmidt , webster & lewis 1998 ) . in this scenario with large normalized surface mass densities , given a component , microlensing violent events will result from the source either crossing a microcaustic , passing close to a microcusp , or traveling through a network of microcaustics ( e.g. , schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) . on the other hand , a microlensing violent episode in the light curve of a component can be easily distinguished from a intrinsic variation , since the intrinsic variability must be observed in all four components of the system with extremely short time delays ( e.g. , wambsganss & paczy ' nski 1994 ; chae , turnshek & khersonsky 1998 ; schmidt , webster & lewis 1998 ) .",
    "however , when the four brightness records of the qso images have different non - flat shapes , a direct separation between the true microlensing fluctuations and the possible intrinsic variation can not be achieved . in the case of four incoherent and non - flat observational trends , to find the true microlensing behaviours we must do some hypothesis on the intrinsic variability .",
    "irwin et al . (",
    "1989 ) discovered microlensing variability in the quadruple system qso 2237 + 0305 , and that first evidence was confirmed by other observers ( corrigan et al .",
    "1991 ; stensen et al . 1996 ; wo ' zniak et al . 2000a , b ; schmidt et al .",
    "2001 ; alcalde et al .",
    "in very recent years , two gravitational microlensing high - magnification events ( hmes ) were clearly detected by the ogle collaboration ( wo ' zniak et al .",
    "2000b ) and corroborated by the glitp monitoring ( alcalde et al .",
    "2002 ) . as each individual hme",
    "is directly related to the intrinsic surface brightness of the source , the two hmes in the @xmath0 band reported by the ogle team were used to obtain two measurements of both the optical continuum ( @xmath0-band ) source size and the rate of brightness decline ( shalyapin 2001 ) .",
    "shalyapin ( 2001 ) compared the observational data included in each hme with the time evolution expected from an axially symmetric source crossing a single straight fold caustic . to describe the brightness distribution of the @xmath0-band source , he used a power - law model : @xmath6 , which is determined by a typical radius @xmath7 , a typical intensity @xmath8 , and a power - law index @xmath9 .",
    "the expected microlensing light curves depend on five free parameters , and the most relevant ones are @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "we note that a direct measurement of the typical radius @xmath7 is not possible , however , using some upper limit on the quasar velocity perpendicular to the caustic line ( @xmath11 ) , it can be obtained a very interesting constraint on the source size as measured by means of the typical radius of the 2d brightness distribution .",
    "a crossing time of @xmath12 90 days is inferred from the hme observed in the light curve of the component a , whereas a shorter crossing time of about 30 days is consistent with the hme corresponding to the image c. however , the whole hme of image a ( from day 1200 to day 1800 ) seems to be caused by a complex magnification , which is different to the single straight fold caustic magnification law .",
    "in other words , when the main portion of the source is far away from the fold caustic of interest ( before day 1400 and after day 1600 ) , there is evidence for a _ rare _ behaviour , and so , the fit to the whole microlensing event in the brightness record of the component a could give biased estimates of the parameters .",
    "taking into account this perspective , we only take the results based on the hme corresponding to the image c as non - biased parameter estimates .",
    "the value of @xmath12 30 days together with the velocity constraint by wyithe , webster & turner ( 1999 ) give an upper limit on the @xmath0-band typical radius of @xmath13 3 10@xmath14 pc .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained by yonehara ( 2001 ) , who analyzed the same microlensing event but using a different picture and a typical microlens mass of @xmath15 0.1 @xmath16 ( wyithe , webster & turner 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , shalyapin ( 2001 ) found that the value of the power - law index is close to the validity limit of the model ( @xmath17 1 ) and the best - fit reduced @xmath18 is significantly greater than 1 .",
    "apart from the very recent papers by shalyapin ( 2001 ) and yonehara ( 2001 ) , other previous works also discussed the size of the optical continuum source ( e.g. , wambsganss , paczynski & schneider 1990 ; webster et al .",
    "1991 ; wyithe et al .",
    "these first studies are based on a poorly sampled hme which was observed in q2237 + 0305a during late 1988 .",
    "while the continuum mostly arises from a compact source , the line emission comes from a much larger region . from two - dimensional spectroscopy of qso 2237 + 0305 ,",
    "mediavilla et al . (",
    "1998 ) found an arc of extended c iii]@xmath191909 emission that connects the components a , d , and b. the observed arc is consistent with a source radius larger than 100 pc .",
    "the glitp ( gravitational lenses international time project ) collaboration has monitored qso 2237 + 0305 in the period ranging from 1999 october to 2000 february ( alcalde et al .",
    "the glitp / psfphotii photometry in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands ( see fig . 1 in alcalde et al .",
    "2002 ) , showed a peak in the flux of the component a and a relatively important gradient in the flux of the component c. these features are related to the two hmes that were discovered by the ogle team . the glitp light curve for image",
    "a traced the peak of the corresponding hme , i.e. , the maximum and its surroundings , with an unprecedented quality .",
    "for example , the ogle collaboration sampled the @xmath0-band peak at 19 dates , whereas the glitp record included measurements of the @xmath0-flux at 52 dates . moreover , the rest of global behaviours ( components b - d ) were accurately drawn from the glitp photometry ( in this paper",
    ", we will use the psfphotii variant ) .",
    "the @xmath20 light curves of the four components a - d have been also analyzed from a phenomenological point of view , and the global flat shape for the light curve of q2237 + 0305d suggested that the microlensing signal in d and the intrinsic signal are both globally stationary . in consequence of this result",
    ", it seems that the global variabilities in a - c are unambiguously caused by microlensing .",
    "as mentioned here above , the whole hme of q2237 + 0305a seems to be originated by a complex magnification law . however , in principle , the peak of the hme ( just when the main portion of the source crossed a microcaustic ) could be a structure mainly caused by a single straight fold caustic , i.e. , the curvature and other possible close microcaustics do not significantly perturb the simple magnification law .",
    "we adopt this last point of view , and take the glitp light curve for image a , including only data points very close to the maximum of the hme , to be fitted to the microlensing curves resulting from sources crossing a single straight fold caustic .",
    "we remark that the high asymmetry of the peak as well as probabilistic arguments are two strong reasons against an interpretation of the microlensing peak based on a source passing close to a single cusp caustic .",
    "in section 2 we present the expected microlensing light curves when axially symmetric sources cross a single straight fold caustic , and the fitting procedure .",
    "we use a set of axisymmetric sources : brightness distributions enhanced at the centre of the source ( standard physical profile , gaussian profile , and @xmath21 = 3/2 , 5/2 power - law profiles ) and the uniform brightness distribution ( e.g. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; schneider & weiss 1987 ; shalyapin 2001 ) .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the parameter estimation from the comparison between the glitp microlensing peak in the component a and the expected time evolutions for the different source models . a discussion on the v - band and r - band source sizes , the source size ratio ( @xmath22 ) , and the reliability of the source models is also included in section 3 .",
    "in this paper , to obtain information on the dimension of the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band sources , we will use the measurements of the transverse galactic velocity reported by wyithe , webster & turner ( 1999 ) .",
    "finally , in section 4 we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "when a source crosses a single straight fold caustic , a microlensing violent phenomenon occurs .",
    "this is seen as an important fluctuation in the flux of an image of the source .",
    "we are going to describe the properties of a family of axisymmetric sources , present the time evolution of the flux ( microlensing curve ) corresponding to each source model , and finally , introduce the methodology to compare the theoretical curves with observational data .        in a given optical band ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath25 , ... ) , the two simplest surface brightness distributions are a uniform disk and a gaussian disk ( e.g. , schneider & weiss 1987 ) . for the source of uniform intensity ,",
    "one has a well - defined source radius @xmath26 that coincides with the typical radius of the intensity distribution @xmath27 .",
    "both radii contain the total brightness of the source .",
    "however , for the source with gaussian intensity distribution and other sources with distributions enhanced at the central regions , we know a typical radius of the 2d profile ( @xmath27 ) , and assume that @xmath28 .",
    "this last hypothesis permits us to justify the approximation @xmath29 .",
    "for example , in the gaussian case with @xmath30 , the total brightness included in the circle with radius @xmath26 is given by @xmath31\\}$ ] , where @xmath32 is the brightness derived from an integration between @xmath33 = 0 and @xmath33 = @xmath34 . if @xmath28 , we have @xmath35 .",
    "we note that @xmath36 is the intensity at the typical radius @xmath27 ( i.e. , a typical intensity ) , and so , @xmath37 for the gaussian law . as different models have typical radii with different meanings , in a unified scheme",
    ", we define two source sizes : the source radius containing half of the total brightness , @xmath38 , and the source radius containing 90% of the total brightness , @xmath39 . using factors @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which depend on the source model",
    ", the radii @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be expressed in terms of the typical radius @xmath27 [ e.g. , @xmath42 .",
    "for a uniform disk , the factors are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , while for a gaussian disk , we obtain @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "a more interesting set of source models is the family of intensity profiles with behaviours ( @xmath47 1 ) @xmath48 along with the simplicity of the trends , these power - law models allow to calculate the expected microlensing curves in an analytical way ( see shalyapin 2001 , and the next subsection 2.2 . ) .",
    "we shall use two particular values of the power index , @xmath49 = 3/2 , 5/2 , which lead to specially simple laws for the change in flux during a caustic crossing .    for these power - law models ,",
    "the brightness enclosed within the circle with radius @xmath33 will be @xmath50 $ ] , being @xmath51 .",

    "on the other hand , it is easy to show that @xmath54^{1/2}$ ] .      up to now we described models that are not directly related to physical ideas about the quasar central engine , i.e. , we dealt with effective models .",
    "however , we can also consider the standard model of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole .",
    "the standard newtonian model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) is based on the supposition that the released gravitational energy is emitted as a multitemperature blackbody radiation .",

    "the emitted intensity obeys a planck law @xmath61 and taking into account the redshift of the source @xmath62 , the observed intensity @xmath63 is also a planck function at the temperature @xmath64 , @xmath65 at a frequency @xmath66 ( the central frequency of the optical filter ) , from eqs .",

    "the parameter @xmath72 is taken for simplicity to be negligible , i.e. , @xmath72 = 0 ( @xmath73 = 1 ) , in such a way that the final intensity profile leads to a theoretical microlensing variation quite similar to the exact standard variation at @xmath74 1 .",
    "at @xmath75 1 the simplified version of the standard profile is not a useful approach , but as it will be discussed at the end of section 3 , the observed light curves do not show the strong _ break _ predicted by an exact model with @xmath75 1 and the simplified profile ( @xmath72 = 0 ) works reasonably well .",
    "for the standard source , the coefficients @xmath40 and @xmath41 must be estimated in a numerical way .",
    "their values are : @xmath40 = 2.386 , @xmath41 = 7.038 .      the microlensing light curves are basically calculated by convolving intensity distributions with the magnification pattern associated with a single straight fold caustic .",
    "this simple magnification pattern is given by ( e.g. , schneider & weiss 1987 ) : a constant background magnification @xmath76 at points located outside the caustic , and a law @xmath77 at points that are placed inside the caustic .",
    "here , @xmath78 is the caustic strength and @xmath79 is the perpendicular distance to the caustic line .",
    "we take a coordinate frame in which the caustic line is defined by the @xmath80-axis and the centre of the circular source has the coordinates ( @xmath81,0 ) . to obtain the flux from a part of the disk at ( @xmath82,@xmath80 ) , its intrinsic intensity",

    "in particular we estimated the behaviours of @xmath111 corresponding to the five models discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "for the uniform , gaussian and standard disks , @xmath111 was deduced in a numerical way , whereas for the @xmath49 = 3/2 , 5/2 power - law profiles , @xmath111 has an analytical form . in the case",

    "to derive microlensing light curves , the final step will be to use the trajectory of the centre of the source : @xmath114 , where @xmath11 is the quasar velocity perpendicular to the caustic line , and @xmath115 is the time of caustic crossing by the source centre .",

    "( 13 ) will give a good approach to the flux of the involved image as a function of time .",
    "however , the photometric behaviour relatively far from a particular fold caustic could be different to the law ( 13 ) .",
    "firstly , the simple magnification factor @xmath121 may be perturbed as due to the curvature of the fold caustic .",
    "this problem was studied by fluke & webster ( 1999 ) , and more recently , by gaudi & petters ( 2002 ) . secondly , the presence of another caustic ( i.e. , the existence of a network of caustics ) could dramaticly change the magnification pattern @xmath122 and the predicted time evolution of the flux .",
    "thirdly , the background magnification @xmath76 , which is caused by all the point source images not associated with the fold of interest , may actually be a function of the position : @xmath123 .",
    "gaudi & petters ( 2002 ) introduced microlensing curves incorporating a slowly varying background . in practice ,",
    "when one deals with a given observed microlensing peak or event , the trends ( 13 ) must be the first choices to fit it .",
    "of course a family of reasonable source models should be tested . after to do the initial fits ,",
    "if there is evidence for important post - fit residues using all the effective and physical scenarios , then some corrections must be made ( curvature , another caustic , and so on ) . as we will see in section 3",
    ", our dataset does not suggest the need of corrections , and the behaviour ( 13 ) works very well when some source models are considered .",
    "any microlensing peak or event in a component of a lensed quasar can be compared with the theoretical light curves presented here above [ see eq .",
    "( 13 ) ] . given a source model , the light curve during a caustic crossing ( isolated and straight fold caustic ) depends on 4 parameters :    1 .   @xmath108",

    "the most simple test is a comparison of the 1d intensity profiles , i.e. , the integrals of the 2d intensity distributions along the direction defined by the caustic line .",
    "therefore we first simulated a 2d intensity distribution associated with a standard accretion disk ( exact model ) .",
    "then they were derived the standard 1d profile and all the effective 1d profiles fitting the standard one .",
    "the comparison between the standard behaviour and the effective trends appears in fig .",
    "the filled circles represent the standard 1d profile ( including the two typical `` horns '' close to @xmath82 = 0 ) , while the solid lines trace the power - law ( @xmath21 = 3/2 ) 1d profile ( left - hand top panel ) , the power - law ( @xmath21 = 5/2 ) 1d profile ( right - hand top panel ) , the gaussian 1d profile ( left - hand bottom panel ) , and the uniform 1d profile ( right - hand bottom panel ) .",
    "it is now clear that the @xmath21 = 3/2 power - law model very closely mimics the behaviour of the standard scenario , i.e. , it is a rough version of the exact standard model .",
    "we have analyzed the peak of a microlensing high - magnification event which was accurately monitored by the glitp collaboration ( alcalde et al .",
    "the prominent event has occurred in image a of the quadruple system qso 2237 + 0305 ( wo ' zniak et al .",
    "2000b ) , and the glitp team observed its peak in two optical bands ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "as both @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band light curves are characterized by high flux and time resolutions , we attempted to interpret the observational trends in terms of some theoretical microlensing light curves . in principle , the observed microlensing peak could mainly result from the source crossing a microcaustic or passing close to a microcusp .",
    "however , taking into account probabilistic arguments and the important asymmetry around day 1500 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , we have discarded the hypothesis of a source in the vicinity of a single cusp caustic .",
    "thus we only considered the most simple alternative picture : a source crossing a single straight fold caustic .",
    "different axially symmetric source models were used , and consequently , several theoretical microlensing curves were compared with the observed ones . to discuss the reliability / feasibility of different intrinsic intensity profiles ,",
    "all source models were chosen to cause theoretical microlensing curves with the same number of free parameters .",
    "these parameters are two characteristic fluxes , the time of caustic crossing by the source centre , and the typical crossing time .      1 .   from the fits and the upper limits on the transverse galactic velocity claimed by wyithe , webster & turner ( 1999 ) , we inferred constraints on the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band source sizes . for a uniform source model ,",
    "the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band radii should be less than 6.3 10@xmath14 pc = 1.9 10@xmath165 cm , at 1@xmath4 confidence level . for a gaussian disk ,",
    "the typical @xmath0-band radius is @xmath178 7.8 10@xmath14 pc (= 2.4 10@xmath165 cm , at 1@xmath4 cl ) , while the typical @xmath1-band radius can be a little larger ( @xmath178 1.6 10@xmath166 pc = 4.9 10@xmath165 cm , at 1@xmath4 cl ) .",
    "taking the total size of the @xmath1-band source as the source diameter for a uniform disk , or the full - width at one - tenth maximum for a gaussian profile , we found that the 1@xmath4 upper limits on the @xmath1-band source size are 3.9 10@xmath165 cm ( top - hat ) and 1.5 10@xmath3 cm ( gaussian ) .",
    "these bounds agree well with the results by wyithe et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . on the other hand",
    ", for the standard accretion disk , we obtained that 90% of the @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band luminosities are radiated within a radius of 8 10@xmath166 pc (= 2.5 10@xmath3 cm , at 1@xmath4 cl ) , 1.2 10@xmath2 pc (= 3.7 10@xmath3 cm , at 2@xmath4 cl ) .",
    "as the total luminosity of a standard accretion disk around a 10@xmath167 @xmath16 black hole will be probably enclosed in a circle with radial size of @xmath15 10@xmath2 pc , the _ standard _ results are highly consistent with the current paradigm on the central engine in qsos .",
    "however , we remark that other central masses also agree with the constraints .",
    "once upper limits of @xmath179 10@xmath165  10@xmath3 cm are known , we may attempt to test the hypothesis of a negligible caustic curvature ( at @xmath180 7000 km s@xmath156 , the parallel path length during @xmath179 100 days will be also less than 10@xmath165 ",
    "10@xmath3 cm ) .",
    "the typical caustic curvature radius is usually assumed to be the einstein - ring radius on the source plane , i.e. , @xmath181 cm , where @xmath182 is the microlens mass ( @xmath163 = 1 , @xmath183 = 60  70 km s@xmath156 mpc@xmath156 ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath184 , the ratios between the optical radii and the typical caustic curvature radius will be smaller than 0.01  0.1 , and this result supports the straight fold caustic approximation . for a small microlens mass ( @xmath185 ) , we however have a smaller @xmath186 and can not confirm the weakness of the curvature effects",
    "we also studied the source size ratio , i.e. , the ratio between the @xmath0-band radius and the @xmath1-band radius .",
    "the source size ratio values are independent of the transverse quasar velocity . at 1@xmath4 cl ,",
    "only the gaussian source model led to a @xmath0-band source being inside the @xmath1-band one .",
    "for the standard source , one hopes for a ratio of about 0.8 , but this expected value could not be confirmed from our microlensing experiment . the 1@xmath4 confidence interval ( 0.53  1.26 ) is in agreement with the two possible situations : the @xmath0-band source being inside the @xmath1-band source , and both sources having a similar size .",
    "an important issue is the reliability / feasibility of several source models tested by us . with respect to this point , we deduced very interesting conclusions .",
    "the usual top - hat and gaussian profiles are not favored from the data in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "the results are better when power - law profiles are assumed , particularly for the model with a power index of 1.5 , which more closely resembles the one - dimensional intensity profile of the exact standard accretion disk .",
    "for the standard source model , the reduced chi - square values are very close to one .",
    "so , an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole seems a good candidate to be the optical continuum main source in qso 2237 + 0305 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and a measurement of the black hole mass and the mass accretion rate could be made in that system ( e.g. , yonehara et al .",
    "this last topic will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "we also note that a hybrid scenario in which the light in the @xmath0 band is emitted from an accretion disk and the @xmath1-band light comes from the accretion disk and another extended region , is not in contradiction with the observed microlensing peaks .",
    "this result totally agrees with the main conclusion of jaroszyski , wambsganss & paczyski ( 1992 ) , who previously tested the hybrid model from old observational data .",
    "the assumption of a complementary @xmath1-band extended source only modifies the expression of the @xmath1-band background flux @xmath187 in eqs . ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) , and thus , the interpretation of its best - value and uncertainties . exclusively using glitp data",
    ", one can try to analyze the possible existence of a light excess in the @xmath1 band . to do this task",
    ", it is needful an accurate calibration of the flux in both optical bands and small uncertainties in the measurements of the background fluxes .",
    "a detailed study of this topic is however out of the scope of the paper , which is focused on the optical continuum main ( compact ) source . on the other hand , in order to fit the observed spectrum of the quasar , rauch & blandford ( 1991 ) did not consider additional @xmath1 light coming from a large region , but adopted a non - classical accretion disk model .",
    "unfortunately , the disk model by rauch & blandford ( 1991 ) can not account for the old microlensing variations in qso 2237 + 0305 .",
    "we remark that the ogle collaboration also monitored the @xmath0-band event in q2237 + 0305a ( http://www.astro.princeton.edu/@xmath179ogle/ogle2/huchra.html ) .",
    "the glitp @xmath0-band photometry traced the peak of the microlensing event , whereas the ogle @xmath0-band dataset described the behaviour of the whole fluctuation . in comparison with the ogle observational procedure ,",
    "the glitp observations are of higher quality because they were obtained with a larger telescope , using a detector with better resolution , and on nights with better seeing .",
    "therefore , as due to the quality of the observations and the excellent sampling rate , the glitp @xmath0-band peak is probably the best tracer of the underlying signal around the maximum of the whole flux variation . on the other hand , the whole event seems to be caused by a complex magnification , which may include ingredients such as the curvature of the fold caustic ( e.g. , fluke & webster 1999 ) , the presence of another caustic , and a non - constant background magnification ( e.g. , gaudi & peters 2002 ) .",
    "the simple fit to the whole event may thus give a wrong estimation of the parameters .",
    "in any case , we chose two ogle observation periods to infer _ standard _ solutions and compare them with the _ standard _ fit presented in table 1 .",
    "the first period included only the end of 1999 , from day 1450.6 to day 1529.5 .",
    "the dataset is called ogle99 , and it corresponds to the glitp monitoring period .",
    "the second dataset ( ogle99 - 00 ) covers the 1999 - 2000 seasons , more exactly from day 1289.9 to day 1766.7 . in table 4",
    "we can see all at once the fits from the glitp , ogle99 , and ogle99 - 00 light curves . as @xmath188 1 for the ogle best solutions , in the time parameter estimation from the ogle datasets",
    ", we considered the 1@xmath4 bounds associated with @xmath189 rather than @xmath176 = 1 ( e.g. , grogin & narayan 1996 ) .",
    "the glitp and ogle99 fits are not consistent each other , but the amplitudes and the crossing time from the ogle99 - 00 brightness record are close to the values of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath124 from the glitp dataset .",
    "finally , we must emphasize that an important progress can be made from accurate and detailed data of a microlensing peak .",
    "one can discuss on the reliability / feasibility of different source models leading to the same number of free parameters , and thus , to discard some of them and to find the models that agree with the observations . given a good model , which is consistent with the data , it is possible to obtain a robust upper limit on the size of the optical source .",
    "if , for example , the good model is an accretion disk around a massive black hole , then one can try to work out a technique to measure the central mass and the accretion rate .",
    "moreover , as the accurate and well - sampled microlensing peaks seem to be inconsistent with some intensity profiles , it could be very interesting to apply the deconvolution method to these peaks and to derive the best brightness distribution in a more direct way ( grieger , kayser & schramm 1991 ; agol & krolik 1999 ; mineshige & yonehara 1999 ) .",
    "although we had not success in the accurate and robust indirect estimation of the ratio between the @xmath0-band radius and the @xmath1-band radius ( the parameter @xmath170 ) , new multiband monitoring campaigns could also lead to relevant measurements of source size ratios . with regard to this last issue , we note that a direct estimate of @xmath170 from the cross - correlation of our @xmath0-band and @xmath1-band light curves is now in progress , but the expectations are not very promising .",
    "we would like to thank joachim wambsganss for comments on a first version of the paper .",
    "we also acknowledge the anonymous referee for some interesting suggestions .",
    "the glitp observations were made with nordic optical telescope ( not ) , which is operated on the island of la palma jointly by denmark , finland , iceland , norway , and sweden , in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ( iac ) .",
