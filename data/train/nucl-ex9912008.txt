    "over the past fifty years nn@xmath6nn@xmath7 reactions have received considerable interest . of those ,",
    "@xmath8 is probably the one which has been most extensively studied .",
    "this is because it is experimentally much easier to identify a two - particle final state .",
    "most older measurements of this reaction are concentrated at higher energies where production via the @xmath9 resonance dominates . with the advent of storage ring technology and internal targets the energy regime closer to threshold",
    "has become accesible .",
    "the first nn@xmath6nn@xmath7 measurements close to threshold were restricted to cross section and analyzing power measurements [ ref.1 - 8 ] , since polarized internal targets were not yet available .",
    "measurements of spin correlation coefficients close to threshold became feasible only recently with the availability of windowless and pure polarized targets internal to storage rings [ ref .",
    "9 - 11 ] .    at energies well above threshold",
    "a number of measurements of spin correlation coefficients in @xmath8 exist . of these ,",
    "the ones closest to threshold are measurements of @xmath3 at 401 and 425  mev [ ref .",
    "12 ] which have been performed using an external beam and a polarized target .    a parametrization in terms of partial wave amplitudes of the @xmath8 data from threshold to 580",
    "mev was carried out by bugg fifteen years ago [ ref .",
    "a more recent , updated partial - wave analysis is maintained by the virginia group [ ref .",
    "14 ] . with only the cross section and the analyzing power as input , the number of free parameters is usually lowered by theoretical input such as a constraint on the phases of the amplitudes which is provided by watson s theorem [ ref.15 ] . in this respect ,",
    "a measurement of spin correlation parameters represents crucial new information because one can relate these observables to certain combination of amplitudes without any model assumptions .",
    "close to threshold , s and p wave amplitudes in the pion channel with a possible small admixture of d waves , are sufficient to parametrize the data . in the following , we will demonstrate that combinations of the spin correlation observables presented here are directly sensitive to the strength of these d waves .",
    "in this paper we report measurements of spin correlation coefficients in @xmath4 at 350.5 , 375.0 and 400.0  mev at center - of - mass angles between 25@xmath10 and 65@xmath10 .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the indiana cooler with the pintex setup .",
    "pintex is located in the a - region of the indiana cooler . in this location",
    "the dispersion almost vanishes and the horizontal and vertical betatron functions are small , allowing the use of a narrow target cell .",
    "the target setup consists of an atomic beam source[ref.16 ] which injects polarized hydrogen atoms into the storage cell .",
    "vertically polarized protons from the cyclotron were stack - injected into the ring at 197  mev , reaching an orbiting current of several 100  @xmath11a within a few minutes .",
    "the beam was then accelerated .",
    "after typically 10 minutes of data taking , the remaining beam was discarded , and the cycle was repeated .",
    "the target and detector used for this experiment are the same as described in [ ref .",
    "9 ] , and a detailed account of the apparatus can be found in [ ref .",
    "the internal polarized target consisted of an open - ended 25  cm long storage cell of 12  mm diameter and 25  @xmath11 m wall thickness .",
    "the cell is coated with teflon to avoid depolarization of atoms colliding with the wall . during data taking ,",
    "the target polarization @xmath12 is changed every 2  s pointing in sequence , up or down ( @xmath13 y ) , left or right ( @xmath13 x ) , and along or opposite to the beam direction ( @xmath13 z ) .",
    "the magnitude of the polarization was typically @xmath14 0.75 and is the same within @xmath13 0.005 for all orientations",
    "18,19 ] .",
    "the detector arrangement consists of a stack of scintillators and wire chambers , covering a forward cone between polar angles of 5 and 30@xmath10 . from the time of flight and the relative energy deposited in the layers of the detector ,",
    "the outgoing charged particles are identified as pions , protons or deuterons .",
    "the detector system was optimized for an experiment to study the spin dependence in @xmath15 and @xmath16 near threshold [ ref .",
    "9,10 ] the @xmath4 data presented here are a by - product of that experiment .",
    "date were taken with vertical as well as longitudinal beam polarization . to achieve non - vertical beam polarization",
    "the proton spin was precessed by two spin - rotating solenoids located in non - adjacent sections of the six - sided cooler .",
    "the vertical and longitudinal components of the beam polarization @xmath17 at the target are about equal , with a small sideways component , while its magnitude was typically @xmath18 0.6 .",
    "since the solenoid fields are fixed in strength , the exact polarization direction depends on beam energy after acceleration . in alternating measurement cycles ,",
    "the sign of the beam polarization is reversed .",
    "more details on the preparation of non - vertical beam polarization in a storage ring can be found in ref .",
    "for each beam polarization direction , data are acquired for all 12 possible polarization combinations of beam ( @xmath19 ) and target ( @xmath13 x , @xmath13 y , @xmath13 z ) . the event trigger is such that two charged particles are detected in coincidence .",
    "then , a minimum @xmath20 fit to the hits in each of the four wire chamber planes is performed in order to determine how well the event conforms with a physical two - prong event that originates in the target .",
    "events with @xmath21 5 were included in the final data sample .",
    "the information from the @xmath20 fit allows us to determine the polar and azimuthal angles of both charged particles . in the case of a two - particle final state the two particles are coplanar and",
    "the expected difference between the two azimuthal angles is @xmath22=180 @xmath10 .",
    "events between 150@xmath23 210@xmath10 are accepted for the final analysis .",
    "the polar angles of the pion and the deuteron are correlated such that the deuteron , because of its mass , exits at angles close to the beam whereas pion laboratory angles as large as 180@xmath10 are kinematically allowed . at energies below 350.5",
    "mev the limited acceptance of the detector setup is caused by deuterons travelling through the central hole of the detector stack , whereas at higher energies the angular coverage is more and more restricted because of @xmath24 missing the acceptance of 30@xmath10 .",
    "events within 1@xmath10 of the predicted correlation of the @xmath24-d polar scattering angles were included in the final analysis . since there is a kinematically allowed maximum deuteron angle which depends on the beam energy , only those two - prong events",
    "were included in the final data sample for which the deuteron reaction angle was @xmath25 7@xmath10 , 8@xmath10 and 9@xmath10 at 350.5 , 375.0 , 400.0  mev respectively .",
    "the correlation between the polar angles of the pion and the deuteron and the coplanarity condition uniquely determine the @xmath26 reaction channel .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of particle identification gates in the analysis did not change the spin correlation coefficients by more than a fraction of an error bar .",
    "consequently , no particle identification gates were used in the final analysis .    since",
    "an open - ended storage cell is used , the target is distributed along the beam ( z- ) axis .",
    "the resulting target density is roughly triangular extending from @xmath27  cm to @xmath28  cm with z=0 being the location where the polarized atoms are injected .",
    "the angular acceptance of the detector depends on the origin of the event along the z - axis . specifically , the smallest detectable angle increases towards the upstream end of the cell . it was only possible to detect deuterons which originated predominatly from the upstream part of the target",
    "since the kinematically allowed maximum deuteron angle increases with energy , vertex coordinates between z=@xmath2912  cm and 4 , 6 , 8  cm at 350.5 , 375.0 and 400.0  mev , respectively , were accepted into the data sample .",
    "this way , background events originating from the downstream cell walls were suppressed .",
    "the known spin correlation coefficients of proton - proton elastic scattering [ ref .",
    "20 ] are used to monitor beam and target polarization , concurrently with the acquisition of @xmath8 events . to this end",
    ", coincidences between two protons exiting near @xmath30 are detected by two pairs of scintillators placed behind the first wire chamber at azimuthal angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 . from this measurement , the products @xmath33 and @xmath34 of beam and target polarization",
    "are deduced .",
    "values for the products of beam and target polarization can be found in table 1 of ref .",
    "background arises from reactions in the walls of the target cell and from outgassing of the teflon coating [ ref .",
    "the contribution arising from a @xmath35 impurity in the target gas is negligible .",
    "background , which is not rejected by the software cuts described above , manifests itself as a broad distribution underlying the peak at @xmath22=180@xmath10 . a measurement with a nitrogen target matches the shape of the @xmath22 distribution seen with the h target , except for the peak at 180@xmath10 .",
    "this shape is used to subtract the background under the @xmath22 peak . within statistics ,",
    "the background shows no spin dependence and is independent of the polar angle .",
    "the subtracted background ranges from 2@xmath36 to 5@xmath36 .",
    "the analyzing power and spin correlation coefficients were determined using the method of diagonal scaling .",
    "previously , we used diagonal scaling to analyze a series of experiments to measure spin correlation coefficients in pp elastic scattering and a detailed desciption of the formalism can be found in ref . 21 .    since we only measure the _ product _ of beam and target polarization @xmath41",
    ", we can not normalize beam and target analyzing power independently .",
    "because of the identity of the colliding particles , beam and target analyzing power as a function of center - of - mass angle are related such that @xmath42 , in particular @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , for comparison with theory we use the quantity @xmath44 for which the absolute normalization depends on p@xmath45q and therefore is known .",
    "the final data with their statistical errors are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "when one restricts the angular momentum of the pion to l@xmath462 , there are seven partial waves possible , each corresponding to a given initial and final state with all angular momentum quantum numbers given . using the usual nomenclature ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "the p - wave a@xmath49 becomes significant , while the other p - wave ( a@xmath50 ) remains small and is often neglected entirely . among the d - wave amplitudes , at , for instance ,",
    "400  mev , a@xmath51 is the largest , followed by a@xmath52 , a@xmath53 , and a@xmath54 with a factor of  20 between a@xmath54 and a@xmath51 .",
    "this is known indirectly from partial - wave analyses ( ref .",

    "the spin correlation data presented here offer a more direct study of the d - wave strength in @xmath8 . in order to demonstrate this",
    ", we need to express the observables in terms of the seven partial - wave amplitudes ( eq.1 ) .",

    "one sees that the combination @xmath1 vanishes at all angles when there are no d - waves .",

    "it is also easy to see from ( eqs .  2 - 4 ) that for all reaction angles , the following holds    @xmath67    where @xmath68 contains only c@xmath62 terms , i.e. , only d - wave amplitudes .",
    "thus , both quantities , @xmath1 and @xmath69 are a direct measure of d - wave contributions .",
