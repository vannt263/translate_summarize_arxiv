    "in the currently favored model for type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) , a carbon - oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) grows to almost the chandrasekhar mass , then explodes due to a thermonuclear instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the modeling of the explosion itself has reached a high level of sophistication , with multi - dimensional studies being routinely carried out by several groups ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the initial conditions of this process remain largely unknown .",
    "this is unfortunate since the geometry of the flame ignition has a large effect on the explosion strength @xcite .",
    "runaway commences once the wd has accreted sufficient matter from a binary companion to approach a central density @xmath0 g @xmath1 where plasma neutrino losses are exceeded by energy generation from a highly screened carbon fusion reaction .",
    "the stage for flame ignition is set by a century of convective carbon burning in the progenitor wd .",
    "it remains unclear , however , if the first sparks to develop a nearly discontinuous temperature gradient on their perimeters ( the `` flame '' ) are concentrated in the center of the star @xcite or spread around by the convective flow in which they are embedded . since this convective flow may have a dipole character , one natural possibility is lopsided ignition displaced somewhat off - center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is known that , once born , the flame experiences an extended period of subsonic propagation  a `` deflagration '' @xcite .",
    "prompt detonation is excluded on the grounds that it would produce spectroscopy , nucleosynthesis , and a light curve very different from observations ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "it would also require a degree of isothermality in the core that would be very difficult to achieve @xcite .",
    "the deflagration poses a computational challenge since the ashes of the burning are buoyant , and that leads to instabilities and turbulence that can only be followed with any accuracy in a multi - dimensional calculation .",
    "the difficulty is compounded by the large range of spatial scales  sub - millimeter for the flame width and kolmogorov scale to 2,000 km for the wd  and the high reynolds number , @xmath2 .",
    "calculations of the same wd differ in outcome because of the assumptions about ignition , various techniques used to treat flame instabilities , and turbulence .",
    "it is not practical to resolve both the flame and the star , so full - star models , such as the ones presented here , rely upon an effective flame model and a subgrid scale model for the turbulence .",
    "qualitatively , the flame advances radially at a speed given by the flotation of the largest plumes , but the lateral spreading of each plume and the overall efficiency of the explosion can vary , depending upon the way turbulence is handled , and on the dimensionality and resolution of the model .",
    "results of different approaches have been published in a variety of studies with the general conclusion that a pure deflagration can give a viable explosion @xcite , not too different from what is observed @xcite .",
    "it remains controversial , however , if these models can give light curves as bright as some observations indicate , or can explain all of the spectroscopic features @xcite .    moreover , these successful models all have in common the assumption of nearly isotropic central ignition .",
    "it may be that nature provides only anisotropic ignition conditions , or it may be that the the observational constraints on a pure deflagration will ultimately prove too stringent . in these cases , a transition to detonation may need to occur @xcite .",
    "the idea of a delayed detonation has been around for some time @xcite , but the physics of that transition , if it happens , is still uncertain @xcite .",
    "recent two - dimensional calculations have suggested that burned material may quickly ascend to the surface of the still gravitationally bound star , sweep around it and , by collision and compression on the opposite side , trigger a detonation in the unburned material @xcite .",
    "this is called by its proponents `` gravitationally confined detonation '' , or gcd .    here , we follow the evolution of one - sided ignitions for a range of assumptions regarding the initial conditions in two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations .",
    "the results are sensitive to the fuel consumption and energy release during the rising stage of the plume .",
    "therefore a correct description of the turbulent deflagration flame is as crucial here as in other models .",
    "we describe our approach in sect .",
    "[ sect : mod ] . before that",
    ", we give a brief motivation of the ignition scenarios explored here .",
    "although @xcite showed that ignition conditions can not be explored reliably in 2d simulations , we can and do use surveys in cylindrical symmetry to get a feeling for the parameter range to be explored , as well as the dependence of the results on numerical resolution ( sect .",
    "[ sect:2d ] ) .",
    "full - star 3d simulations are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect:3d ] , and the consequences regarding the possibility of triggering a detonation are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sect : sdet ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "[ sect : concl ] .",
    "several studies now suggest ignition with an offset from the center of the wd of order @xmath3 @xcite . it should be acknowledged that none of these studies has yet followed the actual transition from a high temperature fluctuation to a flame in a self - consistent way , including the possibility the perturbation is disrupted by turbulence , and all fall far short of the actual reynolds number in the star . also ,",
    "while arguments based upon a probability density function can offer some guidance as to whether a particular temperature is likely to be realized , they can not , by themselves , say whether the high temperature happens in a contiguous region , or in many disparate points , or even over some interval of time .",
    "still , the calculations of @xcite do suggest that ignition is unlikely to occur as a single spherical bubble either at the center or off - center .",
    "rather the distribution of high temperature may look more like a `` teardrop '' , spreading as it goes out to a large opening angle .",
    "we thus explore here a variety of initial conditions ranging from nearly spherical bubbles far off center , to ignition in multiple points forming complex configurations .",
    "the models are named according to their dimensionality and the ignition characteristics where `` b '' stands for a single bubble ( spherical as much as cartesian coordinates allow ) with an attached number indicating its radius in kilometers , `` p '' is a highly perturbed bubble,``t '' stands for a teardrop distribution of multiple bubbles followed by a `` 1 '' to indicate a strictly one - sided ignition and by a `` 2 '' when the ignition region overshoots to the opposite side .",
    "where appropriate , `` d '' followed by a number gives the distance of the ignition center from the middle of the wd in the bubble case ( and the maximum extent of ignition measured from the wd s center in the teardrop case ) .",
    "for example , model 3b50d200 is a 3d simulation with an ignition in form of a spherical bubble of radius @xmath4 centered 200 km from the middle of the star .",
    "there may also be variations on these names based upon resolution ( a , b , c , etc ) .",
    "the implementation of the deflagration sn  ia  model follows the detailed descriptions given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics is modeled via the piecewise parabolic method @xcite in the prometheus implementation @xcite , in combination with a wd matter equation of state incorporating an electron gas relativistic and degenerate to variable degrees , a boltzmann gas of nuclei , photons and electron - positron pairs .",
    "since the results are sensitive to small perturbations of the initial flame configuration , the directional splitting in the hydrodynamics solver , as well as discretization errors on the cartesian grid may provide seeds for developing instabilities .",
    "this is not necessarily unphysical . in a realistic sn  ia  explosion ,",
    "the background is not expected to be smooth , nor will the initial flame shape be perfectly regular .",
    "but , as discussed below , one sometimes has little control over these effects .",
    "another crucial aspect of the modeling is the prescription for flame propagation .",
    "we strive to implement here a consistent model for burning in the flamelet regime following standard theories of turbulent combustion  such as they are .",
    "the fundamental assumption is the establishment of a turbulent cascade from large - scale eddies produced by shear instabilities at the interfaces of burning bubbles down to the kolmogorov scale , where viscous effects dissipate the turbulent kinetic energy .",
    "the flame interacts with turbulence down to the gibson scale , where the laminar burning speed @xmath5 becomes comparable to the turbulent velocity fluctuations @xmath6 . by definition in the flamelet regime , this gibson scale is large compared to the width of the flame  a condition that holds for most parts of the supernova explosion until quite low densities are reached ( for an approach to modeling stages beyond this regime see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus the internal flame structure remains unaffected by turbulent eddies .",
    "@xcite first pointed out that the turbulent flame front in these circumstances should propagate with an effective velocity that is proportional to the turbulent velocity fluctuations and independent of the burning microphysics .    following this concept ,",
    "the flame is modeled as a sharp interface separating the fuel from the ashes .",
    "its propagation is followed in a level set approach @xcite , where the flame front is associated with the zero level set of a scalar , @xmath7 , defined to be a signed distance function away from the flame .",
    "this front is advanced as described by @xcite .",
    "the speed of flame propagation is a function of the turbulent velocity fluctuations on the scale of the computational grid cells .",
    "its value is determined from a subgrid - scale turbulence model . in the 2d simulations ,",
    "this model is implemented according to @xcite , and the turbulent flame speed , @xmath8 , is set equal to the turbulent velocity fluctuations , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the subgrid - scale turbulent specific kinetic energy .",
    "the 3d simulations employ an improved subgrid - scale model @xcite .",
    "that model , based upon localized closures for the terms of the balance equation of turbulent subgrid - scale energy , does not need to assume a specific scaling behavior of the turbulent cascade , nor isotropy of the turbulence .",
    "the flame propagation speed is implemented as @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 denoting the subgrid - scale turbulence velocity @xcite .",
    "nuclear reactions are implemented in a simple way described by @xcite .",
    "only four species , @xmath14c , @xmath15o , @xmath16 mg , @xmath17ni , and @xmath18-particles , are taken into account .",
    "material traversed by the flame front is converted to a composition represented by a temperature - dependent mixture of @xmath17ni and @xmath18-particles in nuclear statistical equilibrium , or , at fuel densities below @xmath19 , to intermediate mass elements represented by @xmath16 mg . at fuel densities below @xmath20 nuclear reactions",
    "are assumed to cease .    in all simulations",
    "the wd was set up cold and isothermal with a temperature of @xmath21 and a central density of @xmath22 composed of equal parts of carbon and oxygen .",
    "the discretization on the computational grid follows the strategy of two nested moving grids suggested by @xcite , where a fine - resolved uniform inner grid contains the flame while an outer grid with exponentially growing grid cells accommodates the wd star and follows its expansion . due to flame propagation inside the wd , it is possible to subsequently collect adjacent grid cells of the outer grid into the uniform part , as soon as the cell sizes match thereby optimizing the resolution for the given number of computational grid cells .",
    "the parameter space and the dependence of the results on numerical resolution were first explored assuming cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the results obtained in 2d should not be used to draw quantitative conclusions , but are a numerically inexpensive way to explore a broad range of possibilities .    in the cylindrical @xmath23-setups ,",
    "the entire wd was accommodated on the grid , from its center to its radius assuming rotational symmetry about the @xmath24-axis ( see top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo2d ] ) .      as a first numerical experiment ,",
    "the flame was initiated in the simplest conceivable configuration : a single spherical bubble ignited somewhere on the @xmath24-axis .",
    "even this simple configuration has three parameters that potentially impact the evolution of the explosion .",
    "one is the resolution of the flame and the wd star .",
    "two additional parameters  the displacement of the igniting bubble from the center of the wd and its radius  are more physical in nature . as an illustrative model , consider one where ignition took place @xmath25 off - center in a spherical bubble of radius @xmath26 ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : evo2d ] ) .",
    "the resolution for this example study ( model 2b50d200c , table  [ tab : res ] ) was 256 grid cells in @xmath27-direction and 512 grid cells in @xmath24-direction , and the initial setup is shown in the top left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo2d ] . in the top middle panel , a close - up on the flame illustrates the evolution from the initial spherical shape to a more irregular toroidal structure . this is a consequence of the buoyancy - induced flotation of the bubble acting in combination with self - propagation of the flame due to burning .",
    "the flame floats towards the surface of the star , thereby being subject to considerable lateral spread ( cf .",
    "snapshots at @xmath28 and @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : evo2d ] ) . at @xmath30 ,",
    "burning has ceased since the fuel density ahead of the flame has dropped below @xmath31 . the burned material sweeps around the star since it is still gravitationally bound .",
    "although it extends to rather large radii , only about @xmath32 is located outside a radius of @xmath33 at @xmath34 .",
    "only @xmath35 of the wd is burned , inadequate to unbind the star . in the outer layers of the wd",
    "opposite to the flame ignition , burned material collides subsonically with a compressional front moving ahead of the actual ash . in the simulation , the evolution continues by an expansion of the outer layers while the central parts of the wd contract such that the inner parts of the flame eventually reach fuel densities above the threshold of @xmath31 . in our flame description burning resumes at this point , and",
    "the newly processed material is expelled into the ash region ( cf .",
    "[ fig : evo2d ] , snapshot at @xmath36 ) .",
    "this , however , is sensitive to the way burning is implemented in the code ( either completely `` on '' for densities above 10@xmath37 g @xmath1 , or `` off '' for lower densities ) and may not be a realistic occurrence .    as pointed out by @xcite , the collision of the gravitationally bound material sweeping around the surface of the wd marks an interesting point in the evolution . to initiate a spontaneous detonation , high density and temperature are both necessary in the unburned material at the focus of the collision .",
    "the cylindrical - symmetric setup forces the collision of burned material to take place at the negative part of the @xmath24-axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : coll_tem ] shows the temperature of the material in the model described above .",
    "the snapshot was taken at the instant of peak temperature in the compressed fuel in the collision region .",

    "for each simulation , the maximum temperature in the unburned material in the collision region was determined , along with the nuclear energy release prior to reaching this temperature .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tab : res ] .",
    "there is significant scatter in the critical collision temperature with values deviating by up to 43% .",
    "a similar variation is seen in the energy of the burning .",
    "although a clear trend is not apparent in table  [ tab : res ] , it seems that better numerical resolution leads to less energy release in the burning , less expansion , and hence to a stronger collision in the unburned material .",
    "the scatter is larger when starting with bubbles of smaller radius .",
    "previous studies suggest convergent results should be obtained with a resolution of about 256 cells per dimension in one octant @xcite . here",
    "the situation is different .",
    "while previous resolution studies were carried out on the basis of an initial flame setup with well specified perturbations imposed on it , all seeds for growing nonlinear instabilities in the spherical bubble setup applied here are introduced by numerical artifacts , such as discretization errors and noise .",
    "this setup is not a well - posed numerical problem because the evolution of nonlinear features in the flame structure is expected to be strongly resolution dependent and thus numerical convergence is problematic . given that the flame evolution is dominated by strongly nonlinear effects , the variation in table 1 is no big surprise and is illustrative of the uncertainty in our results .",
    "we emphasize though that this is not due to the numerical methods applied here , but due to the variable ( and artificial ) initial setup .",
    "viewed this way , the results of the resolution study can be understood in a straightforward manner .",
    "it should be noted that the resolution affects the answer in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", it affects the temperature in the collision because higher resolution smears out the hot spot less .",
    "but , on the other hand , it also affects the propagation of the flame as it moves outwards in the star , as illustrated by the variable explosion energy .",
    "higher resolution decreases the discretization errors and therefore reduces the seeds for the growth of nonlinear perturbations .",
    "therefore the flame develops less surface , less material is consumed and the lower energy release leads to a weaker expansion of the star .",
    "the material sweeping around at the surface is stronger gravitationally bound and the clash is more vigorous .",
    "smaller initial flame bubbles are more sensitive to the numerical resolution .",
    "this is understandable since here bubble flotation is slower and nonlinear features invoked by discretization errors have more time to develop on the way to the surface of the wd .    an imaginary ideal situation with no discretization errors would suppress the nonlinear growth due to instabilities .",
    "but since the wd star is expected to be perturbed by pre - ignition convection and the flame is likely to ignite in multiple spots or an irregular shape , this seems far from reality .",
    "besides the energy release due to burning , the impact of the colliding material will also be sensitive to the morphology of the ash that is driving the unburned material like a piston .",
    "a well - defined , large leading edge of the colliding ash regions should result in a better focus than a multitude of leading features .",
    "since the flame morphology is determined by nonlinear effects and instabilities , discretization errors in different resolutions amplify the scatter in the results .      the first physical parameter ",
    "the displacement of the initial flame bubble from the center  turned out to have substantial influence on the densities and temperatures reached in the collision .",
    "values from simulations starting with an initial flame bubble of radius @xmath46 and varying distances from the center of the wd are given in table  [ tab : radvar ] . in order to minimize the scatter due to differences in resolution ,",
    "the initial grid spacing of the @xmath47 cells setup was held fixed for all simulations .",
    "note , however , that since two nested grids are used to follow the expansion of the wd and the flame propagation , the resolution evolves according to the energy released in the burning , which is different in the various simulations . nevertheless , a trend of increasing collision temperatures with larger initial flame displacements from the center of the wd is clearly visible ( cf .",
    "[ fig : radvar ] ) . at large displacements",
    "the temperature increases less indicating a saturation of the effect .",
    "a possible explanation is that although here the expansion of the star prior to breakout is decreased , the amount of ashes expelled from the surface also decreases due to less burning taking place .",
    "therefore the momentum of the colliding ash regions is smaller and the reduced impact leads to lower compression temperatures .",
    "flames born closer to the center burn more material and cause more expansion ( cf .  table  [ tab : radvar ] ) . displacing the initial flame bubble from @xmath4 to @xmath48 off - center decreases",
    "the nuclear energy release for 94% and increases the maximum temperature reached in the collision by 250% .",
    "such a large displacement as 600 km is not realistic , but the consequences may be the same as for a bubble ignited closer in , but with a less efficient prescription for burning on the way out .",

    "[ fig : et1 ] ) . whether accomplished through a change in resolution , a displacement of ignition point , or a different morphology for the ignition region , less burning on the way out correlates with a stronger , hotter collision on the far side .",

    "this effect has been seen in previous simulations where 3d- , centrally - ignited setups released significantly more energy than their 2d - counterparts @xcite .",
    "this causes more expansion and weaker collisions .    finally , when the collision geometry is no longer restricted by cylindrical geometry , one expects less focusing , again weakening the collision strength .",
    "in two of the simulations , the flame was again ignited as a single spherical bubble . the subsequent evolution is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : evo3d ] . due to the interplay of burning and buoyancy , the burning bubble alters its shape from a sphere to a torus during the first few tenths of a second ( cf . , upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo3d ] ) .",
    "this evolution is very similar to the results of @xcite who simulated a burning bubble on small scales fully resolving the flame structure .",
    "the developing torus is more regular than the respective flame structures found in the 2d simulations .",
    "nonetheless , it is subject to instabilities , and irregular features grow , mostly on the outward side of the burning region .",
    "the seeds for these features are probably discretization errors .    once the ashes reach the outer parts of the star ( n.b . ,",
    "not necessarily the surface ) , they start to sweep around its core .",
    "interestingly , the leading edge of this sweeping material is defined , even in 3d , by the former torus and therefore only slightly irregular ( cf .",
    "upper right and lower left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo3d ] ) .",
    "consequently , the clash of the burned material still takes place in a well - defined spot on the opposite side of the wd ( cf .",
    "lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : evo3d ] ) . in comparison with 2d simulations ,",
    "this effect partially compensates for the lack of symmetry restrictions and makes the focus of the collision sharper than expected . in the collision , the temperature increases , as shown by the volume rendering of the temperature field in fig .",
    "[ fig : tem3d ] .    in the two simulations presented here , the initial flame bubbles were displaced @xmath52 ( model 3b25d100 ) and @xmath25 ( model 3b25d200 ) from the center of the wd , respectively .",
    "both simulations were carried out on a @xmath70 ^ 3 $ ] cells computational grid . to gain the maximum possible resolution ,",
    "the fine - spaced inner uniform part of the computational grid was extended only slightly beyond the ignition radius , and therefore the initial resolution of the flame was coarser in the model ignited further off - center .",
    "contrary to the 2d study where the initial resolution was kept constant while varying the ignition position , we had to sacrifice comparability between the simulations to better resolution in the model ignited closer to the center . because of the computational expense of 3d simulations , two parameters were changed at the same time , i.e. , the distance of the ignition from the center and the perturbation imposed on the igniting bubble due to discretization errors .    unlike the 2d results ,",
    "the flame ignited at @xmath25 off - center released more energy in 3d than the one ignited at @xmath52 off - center .",
    "the reason , most likely , is the different discretization errors .",
    "the large features that develop at the end of the torus - dominated phase of the evolution were more pronounced in model 3b25d200 .",
    "therefore more material was consumed and the energy release of @xmath71 was even sufficient to unbind the star ( which has a binding energy of @xmath72 ) . in the simulation ignited @xmath54 off - center , the wd remained bound and the ashes breaking out of the surface swept around the core and collided on the opposite side as illustrated in fig .

    "the collision strength , and thus the maximum temperature reached in the compressed fuel correlate inversely with the nuclear energy released on the flame s way to the surface .",
    "the question of whether the compression of unburned material in the collision region is adequate to trigger a detonation was explored in detail , and the necessary criteria were set out . a detonation can only occur if the fuel temperature exceeds approximately @xmath116 at a density above @xmath117 . at lower densities , detonation requires higher temperatures and eventually becomes impossible , for any temperature , for densities less than about @xmath118 .",
    "the conditions for initiating a detonation were met in several 2d calculations in which the flame ignited in a spherical bubble more than @xmath60 off - center .",
    "less efficient prescriptions for the burning might have found similar conditions in simulations that ignited closer in .",
    "for the initial conditions and flame propagation model assumed , the results of @xcite , may be reasonable .",
    "however , since the flame model applied there is not based on a consistent treatment of the flame s interaction with the turbulent cascade , it is difficult to judge its validity .    _ in three dimensions , all simulations fell far short of initiating a detonation_. some even released sufficient energy to unbind the star .",
    "there are several reasons for this difference . lacking the artificial symmetry of 2d simulations , the focusing of the collision in 3d models can be weaker .",
    "indications for this were found in our simulations .",
    "at least two of the 3d simulations gave significantly lower collision temperatures than predicted by 2d models that burned similar amounts of fuel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : et1 ] ) . a second",
    ", probably dominant effect is that 3d models release more energy than their 2d analogs .",
    "this is mostly due to the additional degree of freedom in developing flame surface area due to instabilities .",
    "another contribution to the difference may be the improved subgrid - scale turbulence model applied in the 3d simulations .",
    "however , this effect is expected to be minor @xcite . an asymmetrically ignited 3d model based on a different flame implementation @xcite burned @xmath59@xmath119 of material .",
    "this corresponds to a nuclear energy release of @xmath59@xmath120a value that falls in the range spanned by our parameter study .",
    "therefore , although the calder et al .",
    "model was not followed beyond the breakout of the ashes from the surface , one expects that that model would also have failed to trigger a detonation .",
    "while we found no example of a successful detonation in our 3d simulations , this possibility can not be completely ruled out since the exploration of the parameter space was incomplete .",
    "an interesting possibility is that of double - sided ignitions , which may be possible in a teardrop - shaped ignition overshooting through the wd s center ( or , in a simpler configuration , as two opposed bubbles ) .",
    "such a configuration shortens the way the material has to travel towards the collision spot once ashes break out of the star s surface on both sides .",
    "therefore the expansion of the star may not be as advanced as in the collision on the far side of a single - bubble breakout . in this case , higher temperatures and densities are expected in the compressed fuel . on the other hand , burning on both sides of the star releases more energy while the flames propagate towards the surface .",
    "this increases the expansion prior to collision . in our simulations , the latter effect dominated and the collision was weak in a 2d model .",
    "a similar 3d model became unbound and no detonation was found in either .",
    "thus , if a multiple surface breakout scenario is to work at all , no more than two widely separated ignition kernels are admissible or there will be too much expansion .",
    "an open question is whether a special placement of two or three bubbles spanning a smaller angle than @xmath69 with the wd s center might favor the first effect , increasing the collision strength by shortening the path of the surface material .",
    "however , the bubbles can not be too close or they would merge quickly due to burning , without significantly compressing the unburned material between them , and there can not be very many , or they will prematurely unbind the star .    keeping in mind the uncertainties of the flame model and the incompleteness of the parameter space explored in 3d simulations , we conclude ,",
    "that although a detonation due to the colliding surface material may , in principle , occur for certain  possibly artificial  ignition configurations , it can not serve as a robust model for sne  ia .",
    "the simulations presented here indicate that it may not be realized in nature at all .    for models that remain gravitationally bound",
    ", failure to initiate a detonation will lead to pulsations of the wd star @xcite .",
    "this may be a second chance for triggering a detonation @xcite and this occurrence will be addressed in a follow - up study ."
