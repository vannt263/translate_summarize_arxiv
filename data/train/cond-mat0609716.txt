    "nevertheless , a complete and consistent picture can not be drawn at this point .    in a more general view , the disordered localized states can be called electron glass : in this terminology mott s model describes the fermi glass @xcite of non - interacting particles , whereas the model taking into account coulomb interactions between the states is commonly referred to as the coulomb glass.@xcite with decreasing temperature or decreasing electron density , a transition is expected from a temperature variation of the resistivity corresponding to that suggested for a fermi glass to a behavior as predicted by es for the coulomb glass.@xcite the dc conductivity is influenced by a coulomb gap @xmath1 which opens in the density of states around the fermi edge @xmath2 due to the long - range coulomb interaction . the transition from one behavior to",

    "while mott described the fermi glass behavior of non - interacting particles,@xcite es supplemented this derivation by introducing the interaction between those two states directly involved in the hopping process that is triggered by resonant absorption of a photon.@xcite thus with increasing frequency there is also a transition from the coulomb glass regime to the fermi glass .    within the model of es,@xcite",
    "the coulomb gap can be roughly evaluated from the temperature dependence of the dc conductivity in the two regimes .",
    "a more direct observation of the coulomb correlation gap in the density of states is possible by tunnelling spectroscopy.@xcite quite recently , a controversy arose whether it is really the coulomb gap which determines the crossover energy scale from the fermi- to the coulomb - glass - like behavior in the frequency - dependent transport . according to es , this transition is driven by the coulomb energy of the sites forming the resonant pair . however , lee and stutzmann@xcite claimed instead that the transition occurs when the photon energy equals twice the coulomb gap width .",
    "a subsequent experimental study@xcite and computer simulations@xcite seem to support the former view .",
    "it was recently suggested @xcite that many - particle correlations might be crucial for a quantitative description of the hopping conductivity .",
    "here we try to resolve this issue by providing more accurate data in a wider range of carrier concentration and a broader range of frequency .    a prime example to study the physics of disordered solids is phosphorus - doped silicon which can be tuned in the insulating regime as well as through the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) at a critical concentration @xmath3  @xmath4 by varying the donor concentration @xmath5 in the single - crystalline host.@xcite when going to low enough temperatures and frequencies , the crossover from a fermi glass to a coulomb glass can nicely be investigated in si : p.@xcite other options to tune the system are the application of magnetic field@xcite and pressure@xcite as has also been done for si : b.@xcite for small enough doping concentration @xmath6 , a different effect was inferred by the strong @xmath7 dependence ; the vrh subsides and a simple activated behavior is observed.@xcite due to on - site coulomb repulsion , a hubbard gap @xmath8 splits the impurity band . while a clear distinction between uncompensated si : p and compensated si:(p , b ) is seen in dc transport,@xcite it is not clear how this effects the frequency - dependent transport .",
    "the work presented in the following mainly concentrates on the temperature and frequency variation of the conductivity ; the experimental data are compared with the theory by shklovskii and efros in order to elucidate the influence of electronic correlations on the transport in disordered electron solids .",

    "these results , plotted in fig .",
    "[ figconcdeploc ] , can be well described by a critical exponent of @xmath151 according to eq.([eq : nu ] ) .",
    "our findings are in excellent agreement with similar experiments for which @xmath152 was reported.@xcite they fulfill the harris criterion@xcite @xmath153 , with @xmath52 the spatial dimension , which implies that the disorder does not affect the critical behavior .    scaling behavior of the localization length in si : p .",

    "looking at related systems , like doped germanium , indicates that the observed behavior is a general one , but also that the actual exponents depend on the doping range under consideration and the degree of compensation.@xcite",
    "our investigations of the electrodynamic properties of phosphorus doped silicon in a broad frequency range from microwaves up to the far infrared underline that electronic correlations between the localized states play an important role at low temperatures .",

    "our measurements show that the crossover energy @xmath158 is not solely determined by the interaction energy @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the coulomb gap in the density of electronic states explains the observation of a super - linear frequency dependence in the coulomb glass regime . when approaching the mit with increasing doping concentration , the dielectric constant and the localization length show critical behavior , in good agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "however , there remain open questions to be addressed in the future .",
    "concerning the dielectric constant , there is the unclear origin of the minimum in the temperature dependence .",
    "as far as the conductivity is concerned , our results should be confirmed in comparable systems , like si : b or si : as . of superior importance is a detailed investigation of the influence of compensation : while the theory of shklovskii and efros was done for compensated semiconductors , most experiments ( ours as well ) have been performed on nominally uncompensated samples .",
    "furthermore , studies in even larger parameter ranges are highly desired to close the gap not only in frequency but consequently also in concentration between the ghz results of lee and stutzmann@xcite and the thz results of the present and other recent studies.@xcite here the concentration dependence of the frequency crossover is of particular interest .    finally , it would be of interest to analyze the frequency - dependent conductivity at elevated temperature , i.e.  when the zero - phonon regime is left . for @xmath159 both photon - assisted and phonon - assisted processes are equally important .",
