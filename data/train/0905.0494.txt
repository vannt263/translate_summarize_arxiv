    "jets and plumes are flow structures of considerable interest  @xcite due to their widespread occurrence in industrial and natural systems , from fuel injection  @xcite , to mantle convection  @xcite .",
    "both jets and plumes occur when flow discharges from an isolated , submerged source .",
    "the distinction between jets and plumes is that a pure jet is driven only by momentum flux at the source , while a pure plume is driven only by buoyancy .",
    "if a discharge has a combination of both momentum and buoyancy , there is no sharp distinction between a jet and a plume , and flows span a continuum of possibilities between the two .",
    "such a flow structure may equally well be referred to as a `` buoyant jet '' or a `` forced plume '' ; we adopt the latter terminology in this paper .",
    "we experimentally studied the morphology of laminar forced plumes and establish the general scaling of their ascent velocity over the full range spanning pure jets and plumes .",
    "we also identify a sharp transition in the shape of the plume head as the type of forcing is varied .",
    "this transition can be traced to the onset of a divergent flow structure in the underbelly of the head .",
    "surprisingly , this transition does not interrupt the scaling of the ascent velocity .    the degree to which buoyancy affects flow emerging from a source is usually quantified by the richardson number ri , defined in eq .",
    "[ ri_re_defs ] , which is the ratio of buoyancy forces to inertial effects .",
    "thus , ri can also be viewed as a measure of the extent to which convection is `` forced '' , in the ri  @xmath2 limit where inertial effects dominate , as opposed to `` natural '' or `` free '' convection which occurs in the purely buoyant , ri  @xmath3 limit . in our experiments",
    ", slightly buoyant ( @xmath4 density difference ) fluid was injected into an ambient , quiescent fluid of constant density .",
    "a wide range of richardson numbers were accessed by varying the fluids and the flux of buoyant fluid at the source .",
    "we measured the ascent velocity and morphology of forced plumes across this range .",
    "not only do jets and plumes occur in a wide variety of phenomena at various scales , they are also studied in a vast array of geometric configurations and flow scenarios  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on unconfined flows , not directly interacting with a boundary , and on flows taking place in a quiescent ambient medium of uniform density .",
    "by contrast , other important cases are jets and plumes in a crossflow or in a stratified fluid  @xcite . for a given set of experimental conditions , the most important factor determining jet or",
    "plume behaviour and evolution is whether the flow is laminar or turbulent .",
    "in addition to being either laminar or turbulent , jets and plumes can be a mixture of both types of flow , with near - field laminar flow that gives way to a far - field turbulent flow  @xcite .",
    "we focused on laminar , forced , compositionally buoyant plumes , for which precise control and characterization of morphology is possible .    forced plumes can be positively buoyant , in the sense that buoyancy forces act in the same direction as the injected momentum , as we consider in this paper , or they can be negatively or neutrally buoyant , as in the pure jet limit .",
    "more complex forced plumes can have several sources of buoyancy , such as in double - diffusive salt fingers  @xcite or chemically reacting plumes  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we only consider buoyancy produced by compositional differences .",
    "finally , the state of jet or plume evolution involves one more important distinction : between a steady , well - developed flow and a starting plume , the transient case for which the injected fluid is penetrating the ambient medium and growing in length .",
    "over the course of its evolution , a laminar starting plume develops its most visually striking feature : a well - defined , evolving head .",
    "given the wide variety of types of jets and plumes , and the wide array of scientific contexts in which they are studied , it is no surprise that there is a lack of uniformity in the terminology used for jet and plume anatomy . as shown in fig .",
    "[ plume ] , we adopt the term _ head _ to describe the structure on top of the plume , and _ conduit _ to describe the fluid emanating from the source that connects and provides volume flux to the head . some authors refer to a starting jet or plume head as a _",
    "cap _ , and",
    "the conduit is sometimes called the _ stem _ , or _",
    "corridor _ in the literature .",
    "the conduit starts at the _ outlet _ of a small pipe , through which buoyant fluid is being pushed .",
    "finally , we use the term _ lobe _ to describe the bottom , under - turning part of the head .",
    "the most prominent feature of a laminar starting plume is the vortex ring that often forms in the plume head .",
    "the generation and evolution of vortex rings has been a subject of longstanding interest in fluid dynamics due to their natural beauty , their utility in engineering applications and their rich history as simple solutions of the fluid equations  @xcite .",
    "vortex rings can be produced experimentally by using a cylindrical piston to inject a finite volume of neutrally buoyant fluid into quiescent surroundings  @xcite .",
    "continuously supplied , neutrally buoyant jets have also been used to study the velocity fields of evolving vortex rings  @xcite .",
    "in addition to neutral buoyancy scenarios , vortex ring formation and pinch - off has also been investigated in the context of buoyant starting plumes , where results suggest some universality between free vortex rings produced by pinch - off and vortex rings generated by a piston  @xcite .",
    "buoyant vortex rings may also be created by the pinch - off of accelerating plumes driven by chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "the majority of work on laminar jets and plumes has focused on the steady variety .",
    "nonetheless , starting jets have attracted interest in studies of combustion  @xcite , and starting plumes in the context of geophysical applications  @xcite .",
    "previous work on laminar starting plume heads has focused on ascent velocity  @xcite , temperature and concentration measurements  @xcite , velocity field measurements  @xcite , and scaling laws for the head  @xcite . since plumes in these studies",
    "were driven by a thermal buoyancy flux produced by a localized heater , a relevant dimensionless quantity is the prandtl number pr@xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath7 is the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the dependence of plume flow on pr has been investigated  @xcite . for plumes driven by compositional differences",

    "some thermal plume heads become non - axisymmetric under sufficiently high forcing  @xcite . more recently ,",
    "a numerical model of thermally driven 2d _ line _ plumes found four different dynamical regions of starting plume morphology  @xcite . while a variety of head structures are known , the nature of transitions in the type of head that forms as experimental parameters are varied has not been systematically explored .",
    "moreover , the conditions under which a stable laminar head changes its morphology have received little attention .",
    "similarly , the scaling of the ascent velocity of forced buoyant plumes has not been previously studied .",
    "we address these issues in this paper .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the experimental apparatus and protocols , and in the succeeding section , we present the results for the scaling and head morphologies .",
    "this is followed by a brief conclusion .",
    "the apparatus used for our forced plume experiments was a plexiglass tank with a vertical glass capillary tube built into the centre of the tank floor .",
    "the inner diameter of the capillary tube , which served as the outlet for fluid injected into the tank , was 3.0  mm , and the inner dimensions of the square tank were 13.4  cm between walls that were 50.2  cm high . a second , smaller square tank was also used which had 9.8  cm between its inner walls and a height of 33.7 cm . a syringe pump was connected to the bottom end of the outlet pipe , allowing fluid to be injected at a controlled , steady rate .",
    "the syringe was filled with glycerol - water solutions slightly less dense than the ambient glycerol - water solution into which they were injected .",
    "ambient solutions used in this experiment ranged from a 20% to an 80% volumetric ratio of glycerol / water .",
    "the densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the ambient and injected solutions were measured using an anton - paar densitometer .",
    "density measurements were made at the temperature that had been recorded in the room during the respective experiments .",
    "the room temperature was measured to @xmath22c , implying a possible systematic error in the absolute densities @xmath20 and @xmath21 of less than @xmath23  g  @xmath24 . however , the difference in densities , @xmath25 , is rather insensitive to the temperature , because of the very small difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the two fluids .",
    "since the ambient and injected fluids were nearly identical , the dimensionless ratio of their kinematic viscosities , @xmath26 , was typically close to unity .",
    "the relevant dimensionless density difference @xmath27 , along with other properties of the experimental fluids , are given in table  [ props ] .",
    "two methods of visualization were employed to observe the plumes . in the smaller of the two tanks ,",
    "shadowgraphy was used .",
    "this technique requires a constant light source to be directed horizontally at the tank . by virtue of the difference in the refractive index of the injected and ambient fluids , the less dense ( injected ) fluid projects a dark image onto translucent white tracing paper attached to the tank at the opposite side to the light source .",
    "a ccd camera was used to capture the shadowgram images of the ascending plume .",
    "the sets of experiments for which shadowgraphy was used to observe plume behaviour are specified in table  [ props ] by set names beginning with  s \" . in the larger tank",
    ", blue dye was added to the injected fluid for visualization purposes . as fluid was being injected and a growing plume was formed , a digital ccd camera was used to capture images of its evolution .",
    "these are given in table  [ props ] by set names beginning with  d \" .",
    "for both the dye and the shadowgraphy experiments , the injected flow rate @xmath28 was varied in the range of @xmath29ml / s to @xmath30ml / s .",

    "[ height ] , for the d4 set of experimental runs , the ascent velocity of the plume head , @xmath31 , increases with the injection flow rate @xmath28 .",

    "the fluid in the head circulates around an axisymmetric vortex ring that remains localized near the top of the plume . as shown in the sequence in fig .",
    "[ plume_sequence80 ] , in order to accommodate the influx of new fluid delivered to the head through the conduit over time , a confined plume head grows and its vortex ring increases in size .",
