    "discrete models have a long and successful history in systems biology , beginning with boolean network representations of molecular networks @xcite and their later generalization , so - called logical models @xcite .",
    "they are qualitative , time - discrete models that are particularly suitable for the analysis of steady state behavior of molecular networks . however , as models become larger it is increasingly difficult to analyze them . in order to keep the analysis of such networks tractable ,",
    "many studies have focused on specific classes of networks such as : single - switch , unate , nested canalizing , threshold , and , and - or , and linear networks @xcite . in order to be useful for modeling",
    ", a family of networks has to be `` sufficiently general '' for modeling biological interactions and `` simple enough '' for theoretical analysis . in this paper",
    "we propose the family of and - not networks as such family .",
    "and - not networks are a particular the class of boolean networks that are constructed using only the and ( @xmath0 ) and not ( @xmath1 ) operators .",
    "a biological justification for the use of and - not networks is that there is evidence that for genes that are regulated by more than one other gene , the different binding sites exhibit synergistic effects between the different regulators @xcite .",
    "this fact motivated the study of conjunctive boolean networks , that is , networks whose logical rules are constructed using exclusively the and operator @xcite , where explicit formulas for steady states are given ; also , upper and lower bounds for the number and length of limit cycles are provided .",
    "but conjunctive boolean networks can not account for inhibitory regulation and the resulting negative feedback loops , which are common in gene regulatory networks .",
    "allowing the not operator , in addition to the and operator ( i.e. using and - not networks ) , can make the family of networks sufficiently general to be useful for modeling @xcite .    for a formal argument that the family of and - not networks is general enough for modeling",
    ", we will show that any discrete model ( finite dynamical system , to be precise ) can be represented by an and - not network .",
    "more precisely , we present an algorithm that assigns to a given general discrete model an and - not network which has the same number of steady states , together with an algorithmic correspondence between steady states of the two networks .",
    "this is achieved by adding nodes to the network as needed .",
    "the potential drawback of this algorithm is of course that the network size can potentially get significantly larger , thereby potentially negating any computational advantage gained by the specialized logic .",
    "however , since molecular networks have typically small in - degree , this growth in the number of network nodes to be added is modest in the case of molecular network models .",
    "we demonstrate this through an analysis of several published models and random networks .    to argue that and - not networks are simple enough for theoretical analysis , we will show how using the specialized logic of and - not networks can provide better theoretical results .",
    "for example , in @xcite , it was shown that an upper bound for the number of steady states can easily be computed for and - not networks ( which is not true for arbitrary networks ) .",
    "also , in @xcite , it was shown that the exact number of steady states of and - not networks are encoded in the topological features of the wiring diagram , and that , in some cases , the problem of finding the exact number of steady states can be transformed to the problem of finding maximal independent sets of the wiring diagram , which has been extensively studied @xcite . in this paper we will show how the specialized logic of and - not networks can give us better upper bounds for the number of steady states ; more precisely , we provide an upper bound for and - not networks that improves on previous upper bounds .",
    "furthermore , we show how this upper bound for and - not networks can actually be used for general networks .",
    "we use our results to analyze a boolean model of th - cell differentiation .",
    "another theoretical advantage of and - not networks is that they are in a one - to - one correspondence with their wiring diagrams .",
    "this observation has several implications , one of which is the possibility to relate dynamic network properties with features of the wiring diagram @xcite .",
    "also , from a given signed wiring diagram one can unambiguously construct and and - not network , which implies that all algorithms or results can be stated at the `` wiring diagram level . ''",
    "for a signed directed graph @xmath2 , we denote @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5.that is , @xmath6 is the set of all incoming edges for node @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , resp .",
    "@xmath9 is the subset of positive , resp .",
    "negative , edges .",
    "all graphs in the rest of the paper will be signed directed graphs unless noted otherwise .    in order to simplify the graphical representation ,",
    "we denote two negative ( positive ) edges between @xmath7 and @xmath10 by a bidirectional negative ( positive ) edge , @xmath11 ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) .",
    "if the edges have different signs we denote them by @xmath14@xmath13 .",
    "an _ and - not function _ is a boolean function , @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 can be written in the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 , then @xmath16 is the constant function 1 . if @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , respectively ) we say that @xmath7 or @xmath22 is a _ positive _ ( _ negative _ ) regulator of @xmath16 or that it is an activator ( repressor ) . an _ and - not network _ is a boolean network ( bn ) , @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 is an and - not function for all @xmath25 . and",
    "- not networks are also called _ signed conjunctive networks_.    the _ wiring diagram _ of an and - not network is defined by a graph @xmath2 with vertices @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) and edges @xmath28 given as follows : @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , respectively ) if @xmath22 is a positive ( negative , respectively ) regulator of @xmath31 .",
    "notice that nodes corresponding to constant functions have in - degree zero .",
    "also , the wiring diagram of an and - not network contains all the information about the network ; that is , we only need to specify the wiring diagram in order to define an and - not network .",
    "[ eg : anbn ] consider the boolean network @xmath32 given by + @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath34 is an and - not network .",
    "its wiring diagram is shown in figure [ fig : anbn ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , some other families of networks that have been studied in the past are single - switch , linear , and , and - or , unate and nested canalyzing functions @xcite .",
    "each family has its own advantages ; however , for the purpose of modeling biological systems and for theoretical analysis , it is of interest to have the following properties : first , networks generated using these families should be able to admit a sign assignment ; that is , it should be possible to determine the sign of an interaction .",
    "second , in principle , it should be general enough to model all networks ; that is , it should be possible to model any type of regulation .",
    "third , for theoretical analysis , it would be useful to have a one - to - one correspondence between wiring diagrams and networks .",
    "this property would allow complete encoding of a network in its wiring diagram .",
    "the family of linear functions satisfies the third property but not the first two .",
    "the family of and functions satisfies the first and third property but not the second .",
    "the family of and - or functions satisfies the first property but not the last two .",
    "single - switch , unate , and nested canalyzing functions satisfy the first two properties but not the third .    on the other hand , and - not networks",
    "satisfy all three properties .",
    "the first property is satisfied because the sign of a regulation is given by the presence or absence of the not operator .",
    "the third property follows from the fact that if the positive and negative edges to @xmath7 are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 , resp .",
    ", then the function for node @xmath7 is uniquely given by @xmath37 .",
    "the second property is given by the fact that any finite dynamical system can be expressed as an and - not network .",
    "more precisely , theorem [ thm : main ] guarantees that steady states are preserved if we rewrite a general finite dynamical system as an and - not network .",
    "in this section we show why and - not networks are a good framework for modeling biological systems .",
    "one issue that can potentially arise when only using certain classes of networks is that one can have difficulty in modeling certain processes .",
    "for example , the family of and networks does not allow modeling negative interactions .",
    "another example is that the family of linear networks , does not allow modeling signed interactions . in order for a family of networks to be useful for modeling ,",
    "is has to allow modeling any type of interaction .",
    "here we show that the family of and - not networks is general enough for modeling .",
    "more precisely , we show that for any finite dynamical system , there exists an and - not network ( possibly with more nodes ) such that they share key dynamical properties .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath38 be a finite dynamical system , where @xmath39 and all @xmath40 s are finite .",
    "then , there exists an and - not network @xmath41 such that there is a bijection between the steady states of @xmath16 and @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 and the bijection between steady states is given algorithmically .",
    "we say that @xmath42 is an and - not representation of @xmath16 .",
    "a simple proof uses the facts that any finite dynamical system can be written as a boolean network @xcite , and that any boolean function has a conjunctive normal form .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proved algorithmically that for any finite dynamical system @xmath16 , there exists a boolean network @xmath34 ( possibly with more nodes ) such that @xmath16 and @xmath34 have the same number of steady states .",
    "furthermore , the bijection of steady states is also given algorithmically .",
    "therefore , we only need to show that there exists and and - not network @xmath42 , such that there is a bijection between the steady states of @xmath34 and @xmath42 .",
    "we proceed by induction .",

    "notice that @xmath49 is an and - not function .",
    "then , define the bn @xmath50 in variables @xmath51 by @xmath52 for @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",

    "@xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 .",
    "that is , @xmath71 is a steady state of @xmath34 .",

    "therefore , there is a bijection between the steady states of @xmath16 and @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath42 and the bijection are given algorithmically .",
    "the transformation of finite dynamical systems to boolean networks has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "so , in the rest of the paper we will focus on boolean networks and and - not networks .    [ eg : basic ] consider the bn @xmath74 given by @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "the wiring diagram of @xmath34 is given in figure [ fig : basic ] ( left ) . in order to transform this bn to an and - not network",
    "we introduce the variable @xmath80 with boolean function @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "variables @xmath80 and @xmath83 will be used in @xmath84 and @xmath85 . notice",
    "that since @xmath86 appears again in @xmath87 , we can simply reuse @xmath80 to keep the number of extra variables as small as possible . then",

    "an additional step in the transformation that can keep the number of extra variables small is given by the following proposition .",
    "[ prop : andor ] let @xmath96 be a bn and define @xmath97 by @xmath98 , where @xmath99",
    ". then @xmath34 and @xmath42 are dynamically equivalent .",
    "it is enough to notice that @xmath100 is invertible with inverse @xmath100 .",
    "then , @xmath101 ; that is , evaluating @xmath34 is equivalent to evaluating @xmath42 .",
    "if some functions of a bn are or - not functions , then we can use proposition [ prop : andor ] to transform the bn into a bn in the same number of variables such that the or - not functions become and - not functions .",
    "also , proposition [ prop : andor ] can be used to transform constant functions @xmath102 into constant functions @xmath103 ( if @xmath102 , then the @xmath58-th coordinate function of @xmath104 is the constant function 1 ) .",

    "consider @xmath110 , given by @xmath111 @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 , with wiring diagram shown in figure [ fig : basicor ] ( right ) .",
    "then , @xmath34 is dynamically equivalent to an and - not network .",
    "notice that the effect of this transformation on the wiring diagram is simple , we simply change the signs of the edges around node 2 .    as mentioned in @xcite , an advantage of transforming finite dynamical systems into boolean networks",
    "is that it can provide insight into the role of feedback loops by disentangling them . in this sense , transforming finite dynamical systems into and - not networks can pass all the information of the role of feedback loops to the wiring diagram . in this case , the wiring diagram is not only a rough representation of the network , but it encodes all the information of the network ; in this sense the wiring diagram `` becomes '' the network .",
    "this has the potential to reduce the problem of studying the structure of the state space graph ( which has @xmath115 elements ) to studying the structure of the wiring diagram of the and - not representation ( which has @xmath116 elements ) .",
    "this can help in understanding the precise role of the network topology in the network dynamics .",
    "a similar approach was used successfully to study conjunctive and linear networks @xcite .      for practical purposes",
    "it is important to obtain an estimate of how much the and - not representation can increase the number of variables . for arbitrary boolean networks , the number of extra nodes can be exponential in the number of nodes . however , boolean models of biological systems are not arbitrary and are actually very sparse with very low in - degree ( typically described by a power law distribution @xcite ) .",

    "the bns were taken from @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to study this question , we have applied the procedure to several published models in the literature and studied the question using randomly generated boolean networks .",
    "the first study shows that the increase in the number of variables for published models is modest ( table [ table : num ] ) .",
    "the number of variables was increased by 14% on average with a maximum value of 4 extra nodes . in order to determine the number of extra nodes introduced by our algorithm for more general bns",

    "the edges followed a power law distribution and we considered the maximum in - degree less than or equal to @xmath119 for @xmath120 ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "the results of this second study are shown in table [ table : k ] .",
    "for example , all networks where nodes have in - degree bounded by @xmath121 can be transformed to and - not networks without increasing the number of nodes . for networks where nodes have in - degree bounded by @xmath122 , our method increases the number of nodes by @xmath123 on average ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "it is important to mention that in both tables , the growth in the number of extra nodes is far less than exponential .      as mentioned in the introduction , the specialized logic of and - not networks can be used to obtain better theoretical results .",
    "such results can arise directly ( e.g. @xcite ) or by applying results about general boolean networks to the family of and - not networks .",

    "[ thm : strong ] let @xmath136 be the wiring diagram of an and - not network , and suppose @xmath137 intersects all strong positive feedback loops of @xmath136 .",

    "the only strong positive feedback loops are @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "since @xmath141 intersects them , theorem [ thm : strong ] guarantees that there are at most @xmath142 steady states .    intuitively , theorem [ thm : strong ] is telling us which positive feedback loops contribute to the presence of steady states ; it says that they have to be strong .",
    "we also provide a slight generalization of theorem [ thm : strong ] .",
    "we need the following definition .",
    "a feedback loop @xmath124 of a graph @xmath136 is called _ inconsistent _ if there is a vertex @xmath143 such that there is a positive path of the form @xmath144 from @xmath143 to @xmath145 and a negative path of the form @xmath146 , from @xmath143 to @xmath147 such that @xmath148 , @xmath149 are not edges in @xmath124 and @xmath150 .",
    "when such vertex @xmath143 does not exist , we say that @xmath124 is _",

    "for example , the set @xmath155 dominates the graph @xmath136 in figure [ fig : completion ] .    with these definitions we have the following theorem that gives an upper bound on the number of steady states using topological features of the wiring diagram ( see appendix b for the proof ) .",

    "it is not difficult to see that the bound given by theorem [ thm : strong ] is greater than or equal than the bound given by theorem [ thm : badv ] .",
    "the next example shows that the inequality is in some cases strict .",

    "specifically , there is a one - to - one correspondence between and - not networks and graphs , so that the network can be reconstructed unambiguously from the wiring diagram . in @xcite the authors followed a similar approach to successfully study cascading effects .",
    "second , due to this correspondence , we can state all results about and - not networks using wiring diagrams only .",
    "this means that questions about and - not networks can be reformulated as questions about graphs ; then , one can use tools from graph theory and combinatorics to study them ( e.g. antichains , posets , inclusion - exclusion principle , independent sets @xcite ) .",
    "this deserves further investigation .",

    "this concept was generalized to multi - state models , and it was shown there that the large majority of regulatory rules that appear in published models of biological networks are of this form .",
    "it was shown furthermore that nested canalyzing networks have dynamic properties one would expect to find in biological networks , such as short limit cycles and a small number of attractors .",
    "thus , the results in the present paper imply that in order to study the steady state behavior of general network models , one can focus on the very restrictive class of nested canalyzing networks @xcite , instantiated as and - not networks and make use of their very special properties .",
