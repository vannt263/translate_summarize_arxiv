    "ecological communities consist of complex webs of interacting species , each of which contain phenotypically diverse individuals .",
    "species interactions including competition , predation , and mutualism , generate nonlinear feedbacks that determine community composition and stability .",
    "these feedbacks are the key focus of community ecology theory . within each species",
    ", individuals often differ in many traits including gender , size , behavior , or physiology .",
    "this variation provides the raw material for natural selection and thus is a key focus of evolutionary theory . traditionally , evolutionary biologists and community ecologists developed theory and ran experiments without considering the other discipline  @xcite .",
    "this separation stemmed from the traditional belief that ecological and evolutionary processes occur on vastly different time scales .",
    "however , in @xcite s review of `` the newest synthesis '' , there is growing empirical evidence that feedbacks between ecological and evolutionary processes occur on more commensurate time scales ( e.g. tens to thousands of generations instead of hundreds of thousands of generations ) and the effects of these feedbacks can be substantial . hence , `` [ n]othing in evolution or ecology [ may ] make sense except in the light of the other ''  @xcite .",
    "a major challenge facing this synthesis , `` is whether the persistence of interactions and the stability of communities truly rely upon ongoing rapid evolution or whether such rapid evolution is ecologically trivial ''   @xcite .",
    "here we confront this challenge for the `` apparent competition '' community module in which two prey species share a common predator species .",
    "predators often consume multiple prey . by mutually subsidizing a shared predator",
    ", the prey species may reciprocally harm each other and , thereby appear to be competing  @xcite .",
    "these negatively reciprocal responses have been demonstrated empirically in plant - herbivore systems  @xcite , insect communities  @xcite , and hosts sharing common pathogens  @xcite . when prey are not resource limited or predation pressure is strong , models predict that apparent competition can lead to the exclusion of one of the prey species  dynamic monophagy  @xcite .    from the perspective of the predator ,",
    "attacking multiple prey may ensure greater energetic gains or provide insurance against the loss of a focal prey species  @xcite .",
    "to what extent these benefits exist depends largely on the trade - offs between the abilities of attacking the different prey species .",
    "for example , many predator species optimal attack rate occur at an intermediate ratio of predator to prey body sizes  @xcite .",
    "hence , predators experience a size trade - off between being larger to optimize attack rates on larger prey and being smaller to optimize attack rates on smaller prey .",
    "early work on the evolution of a predator attacking two prey species has focused on the consequences of the ecological and evolutionary feedbacks on the phenotypic distribution of the predator  @xcite .",
    "for example , using a single - locus selection model based on differential utilization of two prey species , @xcite illustrated that there can be selection for polymorphic predators in which , surprisingly , the heterozygous individuals are the least fit .",
    "more recently , @xcite used a quantitative genetics framework to examine how phenotypic variation in a predator affects ecological outcomes .",
    "they found that eco - evo feedbacks can marginalize or even reverse the negative effects of apparent competition and mediate coexistence of the prey species .",
    "furthermore , at sufficiently strong trade - offs , the eco - evolutionary dynamics exhibit alternative stable states .",
    "this study , however , did not examine how trade - offs influence predator persistence or provide mathematically rigorous proofs of their results .    here , we provide a mathematically rigorous verification of the results of @xcite and explore how trade - offs influence predator as well as prey persistence . in section 2 , we introduce the model which couples lotka - volterra dynamics for apparent competition with a quantitative genetics model for the predator trait . in section 3",
    ", we study a strong form of persistence , namely permanence at which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction  @xcite .",
    "we characterize permanence and examine how the strength of trade - offs influences permanence . in section 4 ,",
    "we refine our analysis of the eco - evolutionary dynamics using singular perturbation techniques and provide estimates for the size of the basins of attraction for the stable equilibria of eco - evolutionary dynamics . coupling these results with a graphical approach to the eco - evolutionary dynamics",
    ", we explore the attractor structure of the eco - evolutionary dynamics and identify under what conditions there is conditional coexistence of all three species . in section 5 , we conclude with a discussion of the main implications of our work and highlight future research directions .",
    "the proofs of the main results are presented in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "there exist a variety of ways that modelers have coupled ecological and evolutionary processes .",
    "these approaches differ in whether the traits under selection are discrete or continuous , the underlying genetic architecture and processes ( e.g. clonal evolution of haploid individuals versus diploid individuals with recombination ) , and whether the entire trait distribution is modelled . here",
    ", we use a quantitative genetics framework which assumes a continuous trait and bears some similarities to the adaptive dynamics approach .",
    "we develop the model from  @xcite step by step to illustrate how the quantitative genetics framework can be used to develop models with eco - evo feedbacks , and to highlight the assumptions underlying these models .",
    "we begin by describing the ecological dynamics in the absence of evolution .",
    "these dynamics involve a predator population with density @xmath0 consuming two prey species with densities @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "each prey species @xmath3 exhibits logistic dynamics with intrinsic rate of growth @xmath4 and carrying capacity @xmath5 .",
    "the attack rate of the predator on prey species @xmath3 is @xmath6 .",
    "the conversion efficiency @xmath7 determines how the number of prey @xmath3 eaten by the predator convert to new predator numbers , and @xmath8 is the predator s per - capita death rate .",
    "hence , the ecological dynamics are given by @xmath9 @xcite proved that this lotka - volterra system always has a globally stable equilibrium that either supports all three species ( coexistence ) , both prey species ( predator exclusion ) , or the predator and one prey species ( prey exclusion ) .",
    "these outcomes can be determined by examining the per - capita growth rates of missing species from the boundary equilibria .    to overlay the evolutionary dynamics on top of the ecological dynamics , we take a quantitative genetics approach ,",
    "sometimes playfully called `` lande land ''  @xcite . in lande land , each individual predator s phenotype is determined by a continuous trait @xmath10 .",
    "this trait determines the predator s attack rate @xmath11 on each of the prey species @xmath12 .",
    "the attack rates @xmath11 are maximal at an optimal trait value @xmath13 and decrease away from this optimal trait value in a gaussian manner , i.e. , @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is the maximal attack rate and @xmath16 determines how steeply attack rate declines with distance from the optimal trait value . in effect , @xmath16 determines how phenotypically specialized a predator must be to use prey @xmath3 .",
    "this model of the attack rates mimics the common empirical situation in which quantitative trait variation in a predator influences individuals relative use of alternative resources . for predator - prey interactions ranging from terrestrial predators of arthropods to aquatic predators of zooplankton  @xcite ,",
    "the attack rate of a predator is optimal at intermediate predator - prey body size ratios  @xcite .",
    "when predators attack prey of different sizes , there is an inherent trade - off between being larger to better attack the larger prey species and being smaller to better attack the smaller prey species .",
    "alternatively , individuals of threespine stickleback ( _ gasterosteus aculeatus _ ) preferentially consume either benthic insect larvae or limnetic zooplankton  @xcite .",
    "for these populations , gill raker length or number are approximately normally distributed , and individuals at different ends of this distribution tend to consume different prey types  @xcite .    in lande land , there are two main assumptions .",
    "first , the trait remains normally distributed in the population  @xcite .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the trait being determined by additive contributions of many independent loci .",
    "second , the variance @xmath17 in this trait remains constant over time .",
    "this assumption allows for moment closure : when it holds , the mean trait value determines the entire distribution .",
    "while this assumption is likely to be violated over longer - time scales , it provides an analytically tractable , first approximation to the full distributional dynamics .",
    "while epistasis , linkage disequilibrium or genotype - by - environment interaction can generate substantial deviations from a normal trait distribution , @xcite showed numerically that the normal approximation still gives remarkably accurate predictions for dynamics of the mean and variance of the trait value under a wide variety of assumptions . under weak assumptions",
    ", even frequency - dependent disruptive selection maintains a nearly gaussian trait distribution  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath17 be the mean and variance of this normally distributed trait .",
    "the phenotypic variance @xmath19 has a genetic and an environmental component .",
    "the environmental component @xmath20 corresponds to non - heritable variation in the trait e.g. individuals that developed in different environmental backgrounds .",
    "the phenotypic variation in the trait , whether heritable or not , influences the ecological dynamics due to nonlinear averaging of the attack rate at the scale of the predator population .",
    "specifically , the average attack rate on prey @xmath3 is @xmath21\\,.\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] , is the density of the normal distribution with mean @xmath18 and variance @xmath17 .    under the assumptions of a normally distributed trait with fixed variance , @xcite showed that the rate of change of the mean trait is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the average per - capita growth rate or fitness of the evolving species . here , @xmath25 for the predator . in words , the rate of change of the mean trait is proportional to the genetic variance of the trait and the gradient of the fitness",
    "intuitively , evolution selects for increasing fitness .",
    "however , due to ecological feedbacks , the graph of the fitness function , `` the fitness landscape '' , may change as the trait changes , leading to eco - evo feedbacks .",
    "putting all the pieces together , we get that the ecological and evolutionary dynamics are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27.\\ ] ] the state space for these dynamics are @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "we begin by examining the conditions that ensure that all three species coexist in the sense of permanence , and how the strength of the trade - off affects these conditions .",
    "we say our system is _ permanent _ if there exists @xmath30 such that @xmath31 for all initial positive population densities ( @xmath32 ) and any initial phenotype in @xmath33 .",
    "to evaluate permanence for our eco - evolutionary system , we begin by considering the dynamics in each two - species subsystem . for the predator - prey subsystem @xmath34 , the following proposition implies that the predator evolves to specialize on the present prey and may or may not persist with that prey at that phenotype .",
    "this proposition states the result for @xmath35 , but also applies for @xmath36 .",
    "[ prop : pred - prey ] assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 . if @xmath39 , then @xmath40 alternatively , if @xmath41 , then @xmath42    for the two prey subsystem , we have the following characterization of the eco - evolutionary dynamics .",

    "we prove both propositions in section 6 . by examining the per - capita growth of the absent species in these subsystems , in which either the predator or prey is excluded , we get the following theorem for permanence in our eco - evolutionary system :    [ thm : permanence ] let @xmath50 be the set of fitness extrema when both the prey are at carrying capacity . if    1 .",

    "@xmath53 for all @xmath54    then the system is permanent in @xmath55 .",
    "conversely , if the inequality in condition ( a ) or ( b ) is reversed , then the system is not permanent . in particular ,",
    "if the inequality in ( a ) is reversed for @xmath35 ( @xmath56 , respectively ) , then the equilibrium point @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , respectively ) is stable .",
    "if the inequality in condition ( b ) is reversed for some @xmath59 , then there exists initial positive population densities @xmath60 and phenotype @xmath61 such that    @xmath62    [ [ note ] ] * note : * + + + + + + +    we conjecture that in fact the conditions for permanence ensure robust permanence ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "is the inferior prey species ( i.e. has the lower value of @xmath63 ) . at intermediate trade - offs , the system is always permanent . at weak trade - offs",
    ", permanence is lost due to the inferior prey species being unable to invade . at strong trade - offs",
    ", the predator can only conditionally establish .",
    "the graphs in these regions correspond to fitness landscapes @xmath24 when both prey are at their carrying capacities .",
    "parameters : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we can use this theorem to infer how the trade - off and carrying capacities affect permanence ( fig .  [",
    "fig : permanence ] ) .",
    "the strength of the trade - off , measured as @xmath68 , has two main effects on permanence , that cumulatively result in permanence only occurring at intermediate trade - offs .",
    "first , strong trade - offs affect prey persistence .",
    "let us assume that @xmath69 in which case condition ( a ) is always met for prey @xmath70 i.e. prey @xmath70 always persists , independent of the trade - off .",
    "if the carrying capacity of prey @xmath70 is sufficiently large and there is no trade - off ( i.e. @xmath71 ) , then the equilibrium only supporting prey @xmath70 and the predator is stable and the system is not permanent .",
    "however , increasing the trade - off @xmath68 decreases the attack rate , @xmath72 , on prey @xmath56 when the predator is specialized on prey @xmath70 .",
    "hence , condition ( a ) for prey @xmath56 , is more easily satisfied at stronger trade - offs ( e.g. prey @xmath56 persists provided @xmath73 in fig .  [",
    "fig : permanence ] ) .",
    "second , the strength of the trade - off determines the shape of the fitness landscape and consequently , the set @xmath49 of fitness extrema in condition ( b ) . for @xmath74 , we have shown elsewhere  @xcite that @xmath75 implies that the predator fitness landscape is unimodal with a single fitness maximum ( see fitness curves in fig .  [ fig : permanence ] for @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , for weak trade - offs it suffices to check the growth at this optimal phenotype for when the prey are at carrying capacity .",
    "alternatively , for @xmath77 , the fitness curves can have multiple extrema , typically with two fitness maxima near the specialized phenotypes and one minimum at intermediate phenotypes when the prey are at carrying capacity ( see fitness curves in fig .  [",
    "fig : permanence ] for @xmath78 ) . for sufficiently strong trade - offs",
    ", the predator will not have positive growth at intermediate phenotypes , and specifically at the fitness minimum , as it can not attack either prey efficiently .",
    "hence , the system is not permanent at sufficiently strong trade - offs as there are initial conditions leading to the exclusion of the predator . furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : permanence ] , if one of the prey has a sufficiently low carrying capacity , then there is a stable equilibrium excluding predators experiencing strong trade - offs .",
    "however , coexistence is still possible in a weaker sense as we discuss in the next section .",
    "to refine our understanding of the eco - evolutionary dynamics , we observe that the phenotypic dynamics occur at a slower time scale than the ecological dynamics . hence , as a first approximation",
    ", we consider the limiting case of when the ecological dynamics are much faster than the evolutionary dynamics . to perform this time scale separation in a quantitative genetics framework",
    "requires a bit of care as the genetic variation @xmath79 which scales the rate of change @xmath18 in the phenotypic dynamics also influences the ecological dynamics through the phenotypic variation term @xmath80 . to separate out these effects ,",
    "we consider the heritability of the phenotypic variation @xmath81 which varies between @xmath82 , when none of the phenotypic variation is inherited , and @xmath70 , when all the phenotypic variation is inherited .",
    "for a fixed level of phenotypic variation @xmath83 , varying @xmath84 only influences the speed of the evolutionary dynamic and has no immediate effect on the ecological dynamics .",
    "hence , for our fast - slow approximations , we assume that @xmath83 is fixed and we vary the speed of evolution by varying @xmath84 .    if @xmath85 , then @xmath18 remains constant and the dynamics of correspond to the classical lotka - volterra dynamics of two prey species with a common predator .",
    "@xcite have studied these dynamics in great detail and have shown ( cf .",
    "theorem 6 with @xmath86 ) that all of the positive solutions of these equations converge to a unique stable equilibrium , call it @xmath87 , whenever all species are initially present .",
    "this equilibrium can either support all three species ( i.e. all components are positive ) , only the prey species ( i.e. only the first two components are positive ) , or the predator species and only one of the prey species ( i.e. one of the first two components is zero , the other components are positive ) . the graph of this function , @xmath88\\}$ ] , defines a piecewise smooth , one dimensional manifold homeomorphic to @xmath89 $ ] that is a global attractor for the dynamics of when @xmath90 i.e. , all solutions with all species initially present converge to @xmath91 .    when @xmath84 is positive but small",

    "is excluded as the superior prey species ( species @xmath70 ) has a sufficiently large carrying capacity .",
    "when the carrying capacities of both prey are sufficiently high , the predator always persists at the stable equilibria , but is excluded at an unstable equilibria when trade - offs are sufficiently high ( figure  [ fig : bif]a ) . at these higher trade - offs ,",
    "the system is not permanent .",
    "however , we conjecture that the system is almost - surely permanent i.e. almost every initial conditions converges to an interior attractor  @xcite . theorem  [ thm : fast - slow ] implies there are two attractors at which all species coexist . at one attractor ,",
    "the predator is more specialized on prey @xmath70 and at the other attractor , it is more specialized on prey @xmath56 . in sharp contrast ,",
    "when the carrying capacity of the inferior prey species ( species @xmath56 ) is low and there are sufficiently high trade - offs , one attractor supports coexistence of all species , while the predator is excluded at the other attractor ( figure  [ fig : bif]b ) .",
    "we analyzed a model introduced by @xcite of two prey species sharing an evolving predator .",
    "the trait under selection is continuous and influences the predator s ability to attack the prey species . in particular",
    ", there is a trade - off in which traits best - adapted for attacking one prey species are nt best - adapted for attacking the other prey species .",
    "we show that the strength of this trade - off determines whether one of the prey species is excluded , the system is permanent in which case coexistence occurs for all initial conditions , or there is contingent coexistence or , more generally , multiple attractors .",
    "we prove that permanence requires that ( i ) each prey has a positive per - capita growth rate when the predator is specialized on the other prey and ( ii ) the predator has a positive per - capita growth rate at all the fitness extrema when the prey are at their carrying capacities . when top - down effects of the predator are strong ( e.g. the predator maximal attack rates or prey carrying capacities are high ) , we show that the equilibrium excluding the inferior prey ( i.e. the prey with the smaller value of @xmath63 ) is stable at sufficiently weak trade - offs .",
    "hence , the community may not persist if the predator only experiences weak trade - offs . on the other hand , for sufficiently strong trade - offs",
    ", the predator has a negative per - capita growth rate at a fitness minimum when the prey are at their carrying capacities .",
    "consequently , there are initial conditions leading to the exclusion of the predator . in the presence of these strong top - down effects , permanence only occurs at intermediate trade - offs which provide the correct balance of reducing the negative indirect effect of the superior prey on the inferior prey and the predator phenotypes always having a positive per - capita growth rate when the prey are at their carrying capacities .",
    "these permanence results highlight how eco - evolutionary feedbacks can alter long - term ecological outcomes .",
    "they complement earlier work on eco - evolutionary dynamics of competing species which found eco - evolutionary feedbacks can facilitate or hinder coexistence  @xcite .",
    "when the trait dynamics occur sufficiently slower than the population dynamics , we characterized the stable equilibria for the eco - evolutionary dynamics .",
    "moreover , we proved that these stable equilibria are nearly globally stable with respect to the ecological state .",
    "namely , provided all species densities are not too low and the predator trait is sufficiently close to its equilibrium value , the eco - evolutionary dynamics converge to the stable equilibrium . verifying this characterization using a graphical approach , we refined our understanding of the eco - evolutionary dynamics when top - down predator effects are strong .",
    "most notably , at strong trade - offs there are two attractors corresponding to the predator evolving to specialize on one or the other prey species",
    ". if the carrying capacities of both prey species are sufficiently high , then all species coexist at these attractors .",
    "however , if the carrying capacity of one prey species is low , then one attractor corresponds to extinction of the predator . if the predator population is initially overly specialized on the prey with the lower carrying capacity , the strong trade - off results in selection for continued specialization on this prey species despite it ultimately resulting in extinction .",
    "our analysis highlights the potential importance of eco - evolutionary feedbacks determining long - term community structure",
    ". however , many challenges remain .",
    "we used a quantitative genetics framework to model the evolutionary process .",
    "while this approach provides a useful first pass on understanding the evolution of continuous traits , genetic variances are likely to change overtime and , consequently , it would be valuable to model the full distributional dynamics to determine the robustness of the conclusions drawn here to this added realism .",
    "comparisons to other models with different genetic architectures , such as clonal evolution or sexual reproduction with only a few loci , will help us understand the role of this architecture on coexistence",
    ". we also assumed that only the predator evolves , but it is likely that the prey would coevolve with the predator . understanding the resulting eco - evolutionary feedbacks is likely to be very challenging , but ultimating crucial for understanding what the role of coevolution in stabilizing or destabilizing ecological communities .",
