    "the sun is an intense source of electron neutrinos , produced in the nuclear reactions of the proton - proton chain and of the cno cycle .",
    "solar neutrinos provide a unique probe for studying both the nuclear fusion reactions that power the sun and the fundamental properties of neutrinos .    in particular , neutrino oscillations , described in the large mixing angle ( lma ) mykheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw )  @xcite theory ,",
    "offer a solution to the solar neutrino problem , the long standing discrepancy between the observation of the solar neutrino flux in the pioneer radiochemical and water cherenkov experiments  @xcite and the prediction of the standard solar model  @xcite .",
    "a central feature of the lma - msw solution is the prediction that neutrino oscillations are dominated by vacuum oscillations at low energies ( @xmath02  mev ) and by resonant matter - enhanced oscillations , taking place in the sun s core , at higher energies ( @xmath15  mev ) .",
    "borexino is the first experiment to report a real - time observation of low energy solar neutrinos in the vacuum oscillation regime by the direct measurement of the low energy ( 0.862 mev )  solar neutrino interaction rate .",
    "we report here the results @xcite from an analysis of 192 live days of borexino detector live - time in the period from may 16 , 2007 to april 12 , 2008 , totaling a 41.3 ton yr fiducial exposure to solar neutrinos .",
    "solar neutrinos are detected in borexino through their elastic scattering on electrons in the scintillator .",
    "electron neutrinos ( ) interact through charged and neutral currents and in the energy range of interest have a cross section 5 times larger than and @xmath2 , which interact only via the neutral current .",
    "the electrons scattered by neutrinos are detected by means of the scintillation light retaining the information on the energy , while information on the direction of the scattered electrons is lost .",
    "the basic signature for the mono - energetic 0.862 mev neutrinos is the compton - like edge of the recoil electrons at 665 kev , as shown in figure [ fig : nu ] .",
    "a strong effort has been devoted to the containment and comprehension of the background , since electron - like events induced by solar neutrino interactions can not be distinguished , on an event - by - event basis , from electrons or photons due to radioactive decays .",
    "the main challenge is then to reduce the background in the active mass in order to reach a signal - to - noise ratio equal to 1 .",
    "the detector has been built following a self shielding design by increasing the radiopurity requirements while moving closer to the active mass . in order to reach a signal - to - noise ratio of 1 an intrinsic radiopurity of 4",
    "10@xmath3@xmath4bq / kg is required both for  and  contaminations .",
    "the borexino purification strategy relies on filtration at the level of 0.05 @xmath4 m , multi - stage distillation and high purity nitrogen sparging .",
    "the borexino detector is located at the gran sasso national laboratories ( lngs ) in central italy , at a depth of 3800  m.w.e .. neutrinos are detected via elastic scattering off electrons in liquid scintillator .",
    "the sketch of the detector is shown in figure [ fig : scheme ] .",
    "the active target consists of 278  tons of pseudocumene ( pc , 1,2,4 trimethylbenzene ) , doped with 1.5  g / liter of ppo ( 2,5-diphenyloxazole , a fluorescent dye ) .",
    "the scintillator is contained in a thin ( 125  @xmath4 m ) nylon vessel and is shielded by two concentric pc buffers ( 323 and 567  tons ) doped with 5.0  g / l of a scintillation light quencher ( dimethylphthalate ) .",
    "the two pc buffers are separated by a second thin nylon membrane to prevent diffusion of radon towards the scintillator .",
    "the scintillator and buffers are contained in a stainless steel sphere ( sss ) with a diameter of 13.7  m. the sss is enclosed in a 18.0-m diameter , 16.9-m high domed water tank ( wt ) , containing 2100  tons of ultra - pure water as an additional shield .",
    "the scintillation light is detected via 2212 8 `` photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) uniformly distributed on the inner surface of the sss .",
    "additional 208 8 '' pmts instrument the wt and detect the cherenkov light radiated by muons in the water shield , serving as a muon veto .",
    "a detailed description of the detector can be found in  @xcite .",
    "an _ event _ in borexino is recorded when at least 25 pmt pulses occur within a time window of 99 ns ( the corresponding energy threshold is about 40 kev ) .",
    "when a trigger occurs , a 16 @xmath4s gate is opened and time and charge of each pmt pulse is collected .",
    "the offline software identifies the shape and the length of each scintillation pulse and reconstructs the position of the energy deposit in the scintillator by means of a time of flight technique . pulse shape analysis is performed to identify various classes of events , among which electronic noise , pile up events , muons , @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles .",
    "the analyzed energy range is 250800 kev .",
    "the event selection relies on the following cut criteria :    0.1 in    1 .",
    "the event must have a unique reconstructed cluster of pmt hits , in order to reject pile - up events and fast coincident events in the same acquisition window .",
    "the efficiency of this cut is nearly  100% because the very low triggering rate results in a negligible pile - up .",
    "events with erenkov  light in the water tank detector are identified as cosmic muons and rejected .",
    "all the detector is vetoed for 2  ms after each muon crossing the scintillator . in this way",
    ", muon - induced neutrons ( mean capture time @xmath7 250 @xmath4s ) and spurious events like after - pulses are rejected .",
    "the measured muon rate in borexino ( muons that cross the scintillator and buffer volume ) is 0.055@xmath80.002  s@xmath9 .",
    "the dead time introduced by this cut is negligible .",
    "4 .   decays due to radon daughters occurring before the  delayed coincidences are vetoed .",
    "the fraction surviving the veto is accounted for in the analysis .",
    "the events must be reconstructed within a spherical fiducial volume corresponding nominally to 100  ton in order to reject external  @xmath10  background ( figure [ fig : radial ] ) .",
    "another volumetric cut ( @xmath11@xmath01.8  m ) was applied in order to remove a small background from  @xmath12rn  daughters in the north pole of the inner vessel , resulting in a nominal fiducial mass of 87.9 t.    be energy region .",

    "cuts are described in the text.,width=302 ]        in figure [ fig : cuts ] the measured spectrum in 192 days is shown before and after the cuts .",
    "it can be noticed that an important peak is present in the data after the fiducial volume cut .",
    "this peak is due to a contamination still present in the liquid scintillator after purification and filling .",

    "moreover , the measured decay trend has a mean life compatible with @xmath13po .",
    "even if contamination is high with respect to the expected signal , it can be efficiently identified in the offline analysis with the pulse shape discrimination , shown in figure [ fig : ab ] . a filter based on the time response of the pc - based scintillator @xcite , slower for @xmath5 particles than for @xmath6 s , discriminates the @xmath13po events .",

    "the borexino measured rate can be combined with the other solar neutrino measurements to constrain the flux normalization constants of the other solar neutrino fluxes .",

    ", the high level of radiopurity achieved allows to investigate other solar neutrino sources .",
    "in particular , cno and p - e - p neutrino detections depend on the possibility to tag and reject event by event cosmogenic background .",
    "this goal is at present under investigation , since can be identified by means of the three - fold coincidence with the parent muon and the following neutron emission and capture on hydrogen .    thanks to the excellent scintillator radio - purity , borexino has also the opportunity to measure the @xmath34b neutrino spectrum with the lowest energy threshold so far . a dedicated analysis with the energy threshold at 2.8 mev is in progress",
