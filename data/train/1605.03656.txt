    "the results of recent high - momentum transfer reactions demonstrate that about @xmath4 nucleons form strongly correlated nucleon pairs with large relative momentum and small center - of - mass momentum ( relative to the fermi momentum ) @xcite .",
    "such phenomenon is explained by the short range nucleon - nucleon interactions @xcite . and such short range nucleon - nucleon interaction is strong in neutron - proton pairs but weak in neutron - neutron or proton - proton pairs .",
    "thus in isospin asymmetric nuclei , protons have a larger probability than neutrons to have momenta higher than the fermi momentum @xcite .    nowadays",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of isospin symmetric nuclear matter is relatively well determined but the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , especially the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is still uncertain @xcite . besides being of great importance in nuclear physics ,",
    "the symmetry energy also plays crucial roles in many astrophysical processes .",
    "thus the crucial task is to find experimental observables that are sensitive to the symmetry energy .",
    "a number of potential observables have been identified in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei , such as the free neutron / proton ratio @xcite , the @xmath5 ratio @xcite , the t/@xmath6he @xcite , the nucleon transverse flow @xcite , the eta production @xcite , etc .",
    "more related references can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    because both isospin - sensitive nucleon transverse and elliptic flows depend on nucleon momentum distribution , they are expected to be sensitive to the hmt .",
    "in addition , in heavy - ion collisions the primordial @xmath3 ratio is approximately equal to @xmath7 at certain momentum space and the @xmath1 s are mostly produced from neutron - neutron collisions while @xmath2 s are mostly produced from proton - proton collisions @xcite .",
    "thus the kinetic energy distribution of the @xmath3 ratio is expected to be also sensitive to the hmt .    since the hmt of single - nucleon momentum distribution in nucleus",
    "was confirmed experimentally at jefferson laboratory , it should be considered in the nuclear transport simulations .",
    "unfortunately , most isospin - dependent transport models rarely took the effects of the hmt into account @xcite .",
    "recently , the effects of the hmt have been added into the transport model by modifying the symmetry potential in nuclear mean - field potential @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary to see the hmt effects of nucleon initial momentum distribution of nuclei on some frequently studied isospin - sensitive observables in heavy - ion collisions , such as nucleon collective flow , free neutron to proton ratio @xmath8 as well as the @xmath3 ratio .",
    "we make these studies in @xmath0 collisions at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon with an impact parameter b = 7.2 fm .",
    "the reasons of selecting b = 7.2 fm are that there are fopi - land data for au+au at 400 mev / nucleon with b = 7.2 fm . and also with larger impact parameters",
    ", one can get clear nucleon flow .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section gives a brief description of the applied ibuu model .",
    "the following is the detailed studies of the hmt effects on the collective flow and the free neutron to proton ratio @xmath8 and the @xmath3 ratio .",
    "the conclusion is given in the last section .",
    "au . taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to study the effects of the hmt of nucleon momentum distribution on isospin - sensitive observables , we use the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) transport model @xcite . in this ibuu model ,",
    "nucleon coordinates are given in nucleus with radius r = 1.2 a@xmath9 , where a is the mass number of nucleus .",
    "[ npdis ] shows nucleon initial momentum distribution with high - momentum tail in @xmath10au , which is given by the extended brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach by adopting the av 18 two - body interaction plus a microscopic three - body - force ( tbf ) @xcite .",
    "the instability of initial colliding nuclei including the hmt has negligible effects on our studies here . as comparison ,",
    "we also give nucleon momentum distribution @xmath11    in this model , we use the isospin- and momentum - dependent mean - field single nucleon potential @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 for neutrons ( protons ) , @xmath14 is nuclear saturation density .",
    "@xmath15 is the isospin asymmetry , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote neutron and proton densities , respectively .",
    "the parameter values @xmath18 = 33.037 - 125.34@xmath19 mev , @xmath20 = -166.963 + 125.34@xmath19 mev , b = 141.96 mev , @xmath21 = 18.177 mev , @xmath22 = -178.365 mev , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 mev / c are obtained by fitting empirical constraints of the saturation density , the binding energy , the incompressibility , the isoscalar effective mass , the single - particle potential , the symmetry energy value and the symmetry potential at infinitely large nucleon momentum at saturation density .",
    "@xmath25 is the phase - space distribution function at coordinate @xmath26 and momentum @xmath27 and solved by using the test - particle method numerically .",
    "the symmetry energy s stiffness parameter @xmath19 in the above single nucleon potential is used to mimic different forms of the symmetry energy .",
    "since we do not intend to study the effect of nuclear symmetry energy , here we just let @xmath19 = 0 .",
    "note here that , besides considering the hmt in momentum initialization , the effect of the hmt on the single particle potential is also considered consistently @xcite . for @xmath28 baryon potential , it is divided into nucleon potential by @xcite @xmath29 we use the reduced baryon - baryon ( @xmath30 ) scattering cross section in medium by a factor of @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the reduced masses of the colliding baryon - pair in free space and medium , respectively .",
    "similar with the definition in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective mass of baryon in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is expressed by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes nucleon or @xmath28 potentials .",
    "at incident beam energy of @xmath36 mev / nucleon , with and without the hmt , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    nucleon collective transverse flow is the moving particles deflected away from the beam axis in the reaction plane , which reads @xcite @xmath37 in the above , @xmath38 is the momentum of an emitting nucleon in @xmath19 direction at rapidity @xmath39 , @xmath40 is the number of free nucleons at rapidity @xmath39 . here , free nucleons are identified when their local densities are less than @xmath41 . shown in fig .",
    "[ pxa ] is the effects of the hmt on the nucleon transverse flow as a function of reduced rapidity . from fig .",
    "[ pxa ] , it is seen that the effects of the hmt on the transverse flow are in fact not evident .",
    "this is understandable since the shape of high - momentum tail roughly exhibits a @xmath42 form @xcite , the number of nucleons with momenta larger than the fermi momentum is just a small proportion of the total number of nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , the strength of the nucleon transverse flow becomes somewhat larger with the hmt than that without the hmt .    in the high - momentum tail of nucleon momentum distribution ,",
    "since nucleonic component is strongly isospin - dependent , i.e. , the number of n - p pairs is about 18 times that of the p - p or n - n pairs @xcite , one expects larger effects of the hmt on the isospin - sensitive collective flow .",

    "[ pxnp ] shows the rapidity distribution of the free neutron to proton ratio @xmath8 and the difference of neutron and proton transverse flows . since n - p pairs dominate in the hmt , from fig .",
    "[ pxnp ] , one sees lower value of the @xmath8 ratio at larger rapidities with the hmt . and also with the hmt",
    ", relatively small absolute value of the difference of neutron and proton flows @xmath43 at larger rapidities is seen in the lower panel . from fig . 2 - 3 , one can see that the effects of the hmt on the free neutron to proton ratio @xmath8 and the nucleon transverse flow are clear but not large .",
    "this is really good news for some physical goals such as studying nuclear symmetry energy by these observables in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "nevertheless , one has to see if other isospin - sensitive observables are sensitive to the hmt .",
    "collisions at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon with and without the hmt , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we now turn to study the effects of the hmt on the differential elliptic flow of unbound nucleons .",
    "the elliptic flow corresponds to the second fourier coefficient in the transverse - momentum distribution and can be expressed as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath38 is the nucleon transverse momentum along @xmath19 axis in the reaction plane , @xmath45 is the nucleon transverse momentum along @xmath39 axis perpendicular to the reaction plane .",
    "a negative value of @xmath46 describes the dominant out - of - plane particle emission while a positive value @xmath46 indicates the leading in - plane particle emission . shown in fig .",
    "[ v2ptp ] is the transverse momentum distribution of nucleon elliptic flow at mid - rapidity with or without the hmt .",
    "it is seen that the values of both neutron and proton elliptic flows are negative , which indicating the leading out - of - plane nucleon emission at such incident beam energy .",
    "the strength of proton elliptic flow is larger than that of neutron , which indicating a strong coulomb repulsion to protons .",
    "and one can also see that the effect of the hmt on the proton elliptic flow is larger than that of neutron .",
    "this is because in neutron - rich reaction system , protons have great probabilities than neutrons to be affected by the short - range correlations @xcite .",
    "anyway , the effects of the hmt on nucleon elliptic flow are not large in the low transverse momentum region but somewhat larger in the high transverse momentum region .     at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon with and without the hmt , respectively.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     ( upper panel ) , @xmath2 ( middle panel ) as well as @xmath3 ( bottom panel )",
    "ratio with and without the hmt in the reaction of @xmath0 at incident beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    since the effects of the hmt on nucleon elliptic flow are generally small , we expect the effects of the hmt on the difference of neutron and proton elliptic flows ( @xmath47 ) to be larger . for comparison , the total nucleon elliptic flow @xmath48 is also presented in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ v2ptnp ] . shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ v2ptnp ] , the effects of the hmt on the difference of neutron and proton elliptic flows ( @xmath47 ) is larger than that of the total nucleon elliptic flow . because the proton elliptic flow is negative and stronger than the neutron elliptic flow , the difference of neutron and proton elliptic flows ( @xmath47 ) is positive and becomes smaller due to neutron - proton correlations in the hmt . comparing fig .",
    "[ v2ptnp ] with fig .",
    "[ pxnp ] , it is found that the isospin - sensitive elliptic flow observable ( @xmath47 ) is sensitive to the hmt .",
    "finally , we examine in fig .",
    "[ rpion ] the kinetic energy distributions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 as well as @xmath3 ratio with and without the hmt in the same semi - central reaction @xmath0 at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon ( while simulating central collisions of @xmath0 at the same beam energy , we obtained the same physical results ) .",
    "it is seen that kinetic energy distributions of both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are very sensitive to the hmt .",
    "the ratio of @xmath3 is also very sensitive to the hmt except in the high kinetic energy region .",
    "the neutron - proton short - range corrections increase kinetic energies of a certain proportion of neutrons and protons , thus more pion mesons are produced .",
    "this is the reason why the value of the kinetic energy distribution of pion meson is higher with the hmt than that without the hmt .",
    "because in isospin asymmetric reaction system , protons have a larger probability than neutrons to have larger momenta @xcite and proton - proton collision mainly produces @xmath2 , one sees lower value of the @xmath3 ratio with the hmt than that without the hmt .",
    "the effects of the hmt on the @xmath3 ratio become insensitive in the high kinetic region .",
    "however , in the high - energy tail of @xmath49 spectra , the @xmath3 ratio could be even more sensitive to the symmetry energy at high densities @xcite .",
    "this is surely interesting to those who use the observable @xmath3 ratio to probe the symmetry energy @xcite without including the hmt in their transport models .",
    "in the framework of the isospin - dependent transport model , we studied the effects of the high momentum tail of nucleon momentum distribution in colliding nuclei on some isospin - sensitive observables .",
    "we find that in the same semi - central reaction @xmath0 at a beam energy of 400 mev / nucleon , the isoscalar nucleon flows , including transverse and elliptic flows are less affected by the high momentum tail of nucleon momentum distribution in colliding nuclei .",
    "the isovector nucleon elliptic flow is sensitive to the high - momentum tail of nucleon momentum . except the energetic @xmath3 ratio , the kinetic energy distributions of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and charged pion ratio @xmath3 are all sensitive to the high momentum tail of nucleon momentum distribution .",
    "because the nucleon - nucleon correlation is hard to embed into the transport model , to probe the symmetry energy using isospin - sensitive observables , the hmt - insensitive observable such as the difference of neutron and proton transverse flows @xcite and @xmath3 ratio at higher energies @xcite are recommendable . and also because the hmt itself is isospin - dependent , it is necessary to further study the competitive relation of the hmt and the symmetry energy on frequently used isospin - sensitive observables .",
