    "the idea of a macroscopic state demonstrating quantum mechanical behaviour was introduced by schrdinger in 1935  @xcite .",

    "this possibility of a macroscopic system being simultaneously in two distinct physical states was initially considered to be a flaw in quantum mechanical theory  @xcite .",
    "however , experiments have shown the predictions of quantum mechanics to be correct as superpositions of macroscopically distinct physical states have been produced in a variety of systems .",
    "these are often referred to as ` schrdinger cat states ' .",
    "for example , a group of six beryllium ions has been put into a superposition of two hyperfine states  @xcite , and persistent currents ( of a few @xmath0a ) of opposing circulation in squids have been detected  @xcite .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are attractive candidates for generating macroscopic superpositions due to the large number of atoms that share a single quantum state .",
    "this may provide a useful system in which to further test the validity or boundaries of the assumption of macroscopic realism .",
    "a macroscopic superposition has yet to be demonstrated in a bose - einstein condensate , although there exist numerous proposals for generating either a superposition of relative phase or number states  @xcite . in the following we consider a particular kind of superposition state of a single component bec in a double well , that is , a superposition of the two states where the entire condensate is localised in one of the wells ( sometimes referred to as a ` noon ' state ) .",
    "if realisable , this kind of superposition promises to be useful in quantum information applications and precision interferometry , due to the measurement uncertainty scaling inversely with the number of particles ( the so - called heisenberg limit ) .",
    "a major difficulty in realising macroscopic quantum superpositions is decoherence , which occurs when interactions with the surrounding environment cause the pure superposition state to decay into a statistical mixture . however , this paper is not concerned with avoiding decoherence in the realisation of macroscopic superpositions .",
    "instead , we concentrate on measurements aimed at distinguishing a coherent superposition from a statistical mixture .",
    "we find even in a decoherence - free environment , demonstrating a superposition presents several practical challenges .",
    "once realised , measurements of the purity of the state could be useful in studying , for example , rates of decoherence .",

    "we consider measurements aimed at distinguishing between a coherent superposition and a statistical mixture .",
    "we focus on quadrature - based measurements , analogous to those used in quantum optics , that can be realized with a ramsey - type interference experiment .",

    "we analyse the effects of atomic interactions and discuss atom loss during the interference procedure .",

    "this can be understood by realizing that it is energetically preferable for the condensate to be localized in one well , but that given the symmetry of the double well potential these two localized states are degenerate .",

    "this will allow tests of macroscopic realism , may be an important tool for studying decoherence , and is a prerequisite to building a practical interferometer using noon states .",
    "the obvious measurement to make on such a system is the atom number in each well . for the noon state",
    ", we have equal probability of finding @xmath19 atoms in the left well and none in the right , or vice - versa .",

    "such a procedure is analogous to quantum optics experiments using a 50 - 50 beam splitter to interfere two photonic modes before intensity measurement , and allows access to phase information . unlike common quantum optics experiments",
    ", both modes contain a similar number of atoms and neither mode can be interpreted as a local oscillator .",
    "this explains the difference between the above definition and the standard quadrature arising from homodyne measurement , proportional to @xmath46 .",

    "similar experiments have been proposed for double well condensates ( for example , to detect a weak force  @xcite ) .",
    "the first step , after creating the superposition state , is to set the tunneling rate between the wells @xmath14 and interaction strength @xmath47 to zero and let the system evolve for some time , @xmath48 , during which an energy imbalance exists between the wells ( i.e. @xmath49 is non - zero ) .",

    "highly accurate atom counting is required to observe the interference patterns in the @xmath76 coefficients , and the associated parity oscillations as a function of accumulated phase , unless an alternative measurement scheme could be realised .",
    "the authors wish to acknowledge support from the australian research council .",
    "for a state with precisely @xmath19 atoms , the ( discrete ) quadrature operator can take @xmath94 values .",
    "therefore , it is possible to express any linear combination of the measurement probabilities ( i.e.  the @xmath95 after the ramsey interference ) as a linear sum of the first @xmath19 quadrature moments .",
    "specifically , the parity can be expressed this way , i.e. @xmath96 where @xmath97 are real numbers .",
    "expanding the power results in @xmath98 where @xmath99 represents the symmetric ordering of @xmath39 .",
    "the operator @xmath100 transfers @xmath101 atoms from the right well to the left , and therefore we can say @xmath102 where @xmath103 are appropriately chosen constants .    putting everything together ,",
    "we finally arrive at eq .",
    "( [ frequencies ] ) , where the the constants @xmath87 can be obtained from the above ."
