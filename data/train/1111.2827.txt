    "@xcite established that for many molecular clouds ( mcs ) their internal velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , is well correlated with the cloud size , @xmath3 , and mass , @xmath4 . since the power - law form of the correlation , @xmath5 , and the power index , @xmath6 , were similar to the @xcite law of incompressible turbulence ( k41 ) , he suggested that the observed nonthermal linewidths may originate from a `` common hierarchy of interstellar turbulent motions . ''",
    "larson also noticed that the clouds _ appear _ mostly gravitationally bound and in approximate virial equilibrium , as there was a close positive correlation between the velocity dispersion and mass of the clouds , @xmath7 , but suggested that these structures `` can not have formed by simple gravitational collapse '' and should be at least partly created by supersonic turbulence .",
    "this seminal paper preconceived many important ideas in the field and strongly influenced its development for the past 30 years .",
    "@xcite confirmed larson s study using observations of @xmath8co emission with improved sensitivity for a large uniform sample of 273 nearby clouds .",
    "their linewidth  size relation , @xmath9  km  s@xmath10 , however , had a substantially steeper slope than larson s , reminiscent of that for clouds in virial equilibrium , ; the maximum projected linear extent , @xmath3 ; the radius , @xmath11 , defined for a circle with area , @xmath12 , equivalent to that of cloud ) to emphasize ambiguity and large systematic errors in the cloud size and mass estimates due to possible line - of - sight confusion , ad hoc cloud boundary definitions @xcite , and various x - factors involved in conversion of a tracer surface brightness into the h@xmath13 column density . ]",
    "@xmath14 since the @xcite clouds had approximately constant molecular gas surface density , @xmath15 , independent of their radius .",
    "the surface density  size relation , also known as the third larson s law , can be derived eliminating @xmath16 from his first two relations : @xmath17 .",
    "assuming that @xmath18 for all clouds , @xcite evaluated the `` x - factor '' to convert the luminosity in @xmath8co  @xmath19 line to the mc mass .",
    "the new power index value @xmath20 ruled out larson s hypothesis that the correlation reflects the kolmogorov law @xmath21 . in the absence of robust predictions for the velocity scaling in supersonic turbulence ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) , simple virial equilibrium - based interpretation of linewidth  size relation appealed to many in the 1980s .",
    "since then views on this subject remain polarized , while it is still uncertain whether gravity or turbulence ( or magnetic fields ) govern the dynamics of mcs . for instance , @xcite argue that mcs are in a state of `` hierarchical and chaotic gravitational collapse , '' while @xcite believe that gmcs are `` predominantly gravitationally unbound objects . ''",

    ", numerical simulations of supersonic isothermal turbulence returned very similar inertial range scaling exponents for the first - order velocity sfs ( @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 for longitudinal and transverse sfs , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ s1 ] and kritsuk et al .",
    "the rms sonic mach number , @xmath27 , used in these numerical experiments is characteristic of mc size scale @xmath28  pc , i.e. right in the middle of the observed scaling range .",
    "the simulations indicated that the velocity scaling in supersonic regimes deviates strongly from kolmogorov s predictions for fluid turbulence .",
    "this result removes one of the @xcite arguments against larson s hypothesis of turbulent origin of the linewidth  size relation .",
    "indeed , the scaling exponent of @xmath29 measured by @xcite for whole clouds and a more recent and precise measurement @xmath30 by @xcite that includes cloud substructure both fall right within the range of expected values for supersonic isothermal turbulence at relevant mach numbers .",
    "more recently , @xcite used observations of a lower opacity tracer , @xmath31co , in a sample of 162 mcs with improved angular and spectral resolution to reveal systematic variations of the scaling coefficient , @xmath32 , in equation  ( [ hb04 ] ) with @xmath33 and @xmath15",
    ". motivated by the concept of clouds in self - gravitating equilibrium , they introduced a new scaling coefficient @xmath34 .",
    "this correlation would indicate a departure from `` universality '' for the velocity sf scaling  ( [ hb04 ] ) and compliance with the virial equilibrium condition  ( [ vir ] ) .",
    "an alternative formulation of the original larson s third law , @xmath35 , implied a hierarchical density structure in mcs .",
    "such concept was proposed 60  years ago by von hoerner to describe a complicated statistical mixture of shock waves in highly compressible interstellar turbulence @xcite .",
    "von  hoerner pictured density fluctuations as a hierarchy of interstellar clouds , analogous to eddies in incompressible turbulence .",
    "mc observations indeed reveal a pervasive fractal structure in the interstellar gas that is interpreted as a signature of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the most recent result for a sample of 580 mcs , which includes the @xcite clouds , shows a very tight correlation between cloud radii and masses , @xmath36 for @xmath37 $ ]  pc @xcite .",
    "the power - law exponent in this relation is simply the mass dimension of the clouds , @xmath38 , which corresponds to a `` spongy '' medium organized by turbulence into a multiscale pattern of clustered corrugated shocks @xcite .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath39 in high - resolution three - dimensional simulations of supersonic turbulence give the inertial sub - range values in excellent agreement with observations : @xmath40 ( @xmath41 grid cells , * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 cells , fig .  [ dm ] ) , depending on details of forcing @xcite .",
    "note , that @xmath38 implies @xmath44 , thus the observed mass  size correlation does not support the idea of a universal mass surface density of mcs .",
    "meanwhile , positive correlation of @xmath15 with @xmath33 removes theoretical objections against the third larson s law outlined above .    with @xmath38 , the power - law index in the linewidth ",

    "( [ hb04 ] ) , even if one assumes @xmath47 ( see  3 below ) . thus we can not immediately exclude the possibility of virial equilibrium ( or kinetic / gravitational energy equipartition , see * ? ? ? * ) across the scale range of up to three decades based on the available observations alone . at the same time",
    ", we have seen that the two classes of observed correlations ( e.g. , linewidth  size and mass  size ) are readily reproduced in simulations without self - gravity @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "non - gravitating turbulence is self - sufficient at explaining the observations .",
    "hence , following occam s razor , it is not necessary to invoke gravity .",
    "meanwhile , in turbulence simulations with self - gravity , the velocity power spectra do not show any signature of ongoing core formation , while the density and column density statistics bear a strong gravitational signature on all scales @xcite .",
    "what is the nature of this apparent `` conspiracy '' between turbulence and gravity in mcs ? why do structures in mcs appear gravitationally bound when they might not be ?    in this letter we use a simple conceptual theory of supersonic isothermal turbulence to show that scaling exponents in the linewidth  size and mass  size relations are connected , i.e. one can be derived from the other . in ",
    "2 we briefly introduce the concept of compressible cascade and discuss potentially universal relations . in  3 we derive the surface density  size and @xmath48@xmath15 relations in several different ways and demonstrate consistency with observations and numerical models .  4 deals with the effects of self - gravity on small scales in star - forming clouds , and discusses the origin of the observed mass - size relation for prestellar cores .",
    "finally , in  5 we formulate our conclusions and emphasize the statistical nature of the observed scaling relations .",
    "in turbulence research , _ universality _ is usually defined as independence on the particular mechanism by which the turbulence is generated ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . following this convention , the non - universal nature of scaling relation  ( [ hb04 ] ) can be readily understood . indeed ,",
    "any scaling law for compressible turbulence formulated in terms of the velocity alone would depend on the mach number . at @xmath49 ,",
    "density fluctuations are relatively small and turbulence remains very similar to the incompressible case with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the scaling steepens at higher mach numbers reaching @xmath51 at @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this transition is also accompanied by a change in the dimensionality of the most singular dissipative structures from @xmath53 ( vortex filaments ) to @xmath54 ( shocks , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to get a universal scaling relation , one would usually have to consider ideal quadratic invariants or , more precisely , rugged invariants .",
    "in compressible isothermal flows , however , the situation in more complex .",
    "there are two invariants : the mean total energy density @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the mean density ) and the mean helicity .",
    "since @xmath57 is positive semidefinite , its contribution to @xmath58 dominates at high mach numbers , while the second term is always subdominant .",
    "hence , in the case of mc turbulence , the kinetic energy density is probably the best possible choice ( if any ) , as far as universality is concerned . in mcs , on scales above the sonic scale , @xmath59  pc , is defined by the condition @xmath60 .",
    "] turbulence is highly compressible and any quantity with universal scaling must depend on both mass density and velocity .",
    "an illustration is given in figure  [ inter ] , where filled circles show the absolute scaling exponents , @xmath61 , of the velocity sfs of order @xmath62 $ ] at @xmath27 .",
    "these exponents would be close to the k41 prediction , @xmath63 , at @xmath49 , if we assumed isotropy , homogeneity , and ignored intermittency corrections . at @xmath64 , @xmath65 shows an excess over unity , which systematically increases with the mach number , indicating a non - universal behavior . a better candidate for universal",
    "scaling is the density - weighted velocity , @xmath66 since @xmath67 at all mach numbers @xcite .",
    "we will use the third - order moment of @xmath68 as its linear scaling implies approximately constant kinetic energy flux within the inertial range , @xmath69 with some minor intermittency correction @xcite . here , @xmath70 is the density - weighted energy transfer rate independent of @xmath33 .",
    "lower and higher than @xmath71 moments of @xmath72 would most probably require substantial intermittency corrections that are hard to predict @xcite .",
    "in the following , we exploit the `` universal '' third - order relation  ( [ k07 ] ) to derive several secondary scaling laws involving @xmath73 , assuming that the effective kinetic energy flux across the hierarchy of scales is approximately constant within the inertial sub - range ( and neglecting gravity ) .",
    "dimensionally , the constant spectral energy flux condition , @xmath74 implies @xmath75 substituting @xmath76 , as measured by @xcite , we get @xmath77 . we can also rely on the fractal properties of the density distribution to evaluate the scaling of @xmath73 with @xmath33 : @xmath78 , which in turn implies @xmath79 for @xmath80 from @xcite . note that both independent estimates for the scaling of @xmath73 with @xmath33 agree with each other within one sigma .",
    "new observational data , thus , indicate that mass surface density of mcs indeed positively correlates with their size with a scaling exponent @xmath81 .",
    "this result is consistent with both observed velocity scaling and observed self - similar structure of the mass distribution in mcs .",
    "let us now examine data sets a1 and a2 presented in @xcite for a possible correlation of @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "figure  [ sigma ] shows formal least - square fits for the two data sets with slopes @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "note that both correlations are not as steep as the virial equilibrium condition  ( [ vir ] ) would imply .",
    "when the two data sets are plotted together , however , the apparent shift between a1 and a2 points ( caused by different cloud boundary definitions in a1 and a2 ) creates an impression of virial equilibrium condition ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ sigma ] ) being satisfied , although with an offset that @xcite interpret as a consequence of lte - based cloud mass underestimating real masses of the sampled clouds .",
    "each of the two data sets , however , suggest scaling with a slope around @xmath86 with larger clouds of higher mass surface density being closer to virial equilibrium than smaller structures . the same tendency can be traced in the @xcite sample of extragalactic gmcs (",
    "a similar trend is recovered by @xcite in the l1448 cloud , where a fraction of self - gravitating material obtained from dendrogram analysis shows a clear dependence on scale .",
    "while most of the emission from the l1448 region is contained in large - scale bound structures , only a low fraction of small - scale objects appear self - gravitating .",
    "let us check a different hypothesis , namely whether the observed scaling @xmath87 is compatible with the turbulent cascade phenomenology and with the observed fractal structure of mcs .",
    "the constant spectral energy flux condition , @xmath88 , can be recast in terms of @xmath89 assuming @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 this condition then simply reads as @xmath94 or @xmath95 , which is close to the observed fractal dimension of mcs .    as we have shown above ,",
    "the observed correlation of the scaling coefficient @xmath48 with the coarse - grained mass surface density of mcs is consistent with a purely turbulent nature of their hierarchical structure and does not require any additional assumptions concerning virial equilibrium .",
    "the origin of this correlation is rooted in highly compressible nature of the turbulence that implies density dependence of the lhs of equation  ( [ k07 ] ) .",
    "let us rewrite ( [ k07 ] ) for the first - order sf of the density - weighted velocity : @xmath96 .",
    "due to intermittency , the mean cubic root of the dissipation rate is weakly scale - dependent , @xmath97 , and thus @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the intermittency correction for the dissipation rate . using dimensional arguments",
    ", one can express the scaling coefficient in the @xcite relation , @xmath101 since , as we have shown above , @xmath102 , one gets @xmath103 numerical experiments give @xmath104 for the density - weighted dissipation rate @xcite .",
    "this value implies scaling , @xmath105 , consistent with the @xcite data .",
    "so far , we limited the discussion of larson s linewidth  size and mass  size relations to scales above the sonic scale @xmath1  pc .",
    "theoretically , the linewidth ",
    "size scaling index is expected to approach @xmath50 at @xmath106 in mc sub - structures not affected by self - gravity ( see  2 and * ? ? ?",

    "size relation using a large sample of @xmath8co structures with @xmath107$]pc .",
    "these data approximately follow a power law @xmath108 for @xmath109pc .",
    "although the scatter substantially increases below 1pc , a slope of @xmath86 `` is not inconsistent with the data . ''",

    "size scaling index , @xmath38 , is expected to remain constant for non - self - gravitating structures down to @xmath110 , which is about a few hundred au , assuming the kolmogorov scale @xmath111  cm @xcite .",

    "in star - forming clouds , the presence of strongly self - gravitating clumps of high mass surface density breaks self - similarity imposed by turbulence .",
    "one observational signature of gravity is the build - up of a high - end power - law tail in the column density pdf associated with filamentary structures harboring prestellar cores and ysos @xcite .",
    "the power index of the tail , @xmath116 , is determined by the density profile , @xmath117 , of a stable attractive self - similar collapse solution appropriate to the specific conditions in the turbulent cloud @xcite . in numerical simulations with self - gravity , we independently measured @xmath118 and @xmath119 in agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "this implies @xmath120 for the mass  size relation on scales below @xmath121  pc .",

    "the characteristic scale where gravity takes control over from turbulence can be predicted using the linewidth  size and mass  size relations discussed in previous    .",

    "gravity can nevertheless help accumulate the largest molecular structures ( @xmath148  pc ) that appear gravitationally bound .",
    "high - resolution simulations of cloud formation in the general ionized / atomic / molecular turbulent ism context are needed to demonstrate that molecular structures identified as bound in position - position - velocity space are indeed genuine three - dimensional objects . on small scales , in low - density translucent clouds , self - similarity of turbulence",
    "can be preserved down to @xmath149  pc , where dissipation starts to become important .",
    "in contrast , in overdense regions , the formation of prestellar cores breaks the turbulence - induced scaling and self - gravity assumes control over the slope of the mass  size relation .",
    "we show that the transition from turbulence- to gravity - dominated regime in this case occurs close the sonic scale @xmath1  pc , where structures turn gravitationally unstable first , leading to the formation of prestellar cores .",
    "our approach is essentially based on dimensional analysis and the results are valid in a statistical sense .",
