    "there are many treatment of the quantum gravity , e.g. string theories @xcite and mini - superspace approach @xcite or loop gravity @xcite .",
    "the theory of the quantum gravity has not yet been constructed .",
    "the theory of canonical quantum gravity is based on adm decomposition .",
    "form the adm decomposition @xcite ; we obtain constraint equations i.e. hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraint equations .",
    "to solve these constraint equations is the orthodox way of the canonical quantum gravity .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is the generator of the time translation and the diffeomorphism constraint are the generator of space translations @xcite .",
    "the theory of quantum gravity contains many unsolved problems which contains problem of the time and problem of the norm .",
    "however , most important problem is the difficulty of the constraint equations , i.e. wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "our motivation is simple and that is to find at least one local solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "our work is not motivated from the higher dimensional gravity .",
    "although the wheeler - dewitt equation is difficult to solve , because it is the second order functional differential equation with diffeomorphism constraints , we had created a method to solve it that we call the up - to - down method @xcite .",
    "the introduced method contains many problems which is peculiar to the quantum gravity .",
    "and some long standing problems e.g. the problems of the norm or the problem of the time has not solved yet . in this paper",
    "we show one of the special local solutions of quantum gravity state for general spacetime metrics on the basis of the up - to - down method .",
    "the obtained state is a solution which satisfy hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the main progress of the up - to - down method is the fact that we can find at least one local solution of the hamiltonian constraint equation .    in this paper , we reconstruct a technical method to solve the wheeler - dewitt equation , which we call up - to - down method .",
    "the up - to - down method consists of the following steps .",
    "first we add another dimension as an external time to the usual 4-dimensional metric and create an artificial functional space which has support of the spacetime metrics , and then we reduce this quantum state to the physical 4-dimensional state , we can simply solve the usual 3 + 1 wheeler - dewitt equation . the same method , however does not work for klein - gordon systems .",
    "the work of this method is different from the mini - superspace models , if we treat the wheeler - dewitt in the general sense .",
    "if we treat the mini - superspace models , the additional constraint appears .",
    "the simplification comes from the embedding of the 4-dimensional metric in the arbitrary 5-dimensional metric .",
    "the ideas of the up - to - down method come from the work of dynamical horizon @xcite and the problem of the time .",
    "the problem of the time is inversely used such that if we add an additional dimension and treat it external time , then this dimension or all the components of additional dimension must be vanish .",
    "although we use the up - to - down method as a derivation , the obtained state does not depend on the derivation .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we introduces the local quantum gravity and reconstruct the up - to - down method which is solving technique of the wheeler - dewitt equation . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we derive one local solution of the hamiltonian constraint equation without fixing spacetime metrics . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we summarize the obtained result and comment on the problems of the quantum gravity .",
    "the local quantum gravity introduced in this section is considered to simply treat the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "the method of the local quantum gravity starts from decomposition of the einstein - hilbert action as , @xmath0ds_i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 is the subset of the hypersurface of @xmath2 with constant time . and",
    "@xmath1 is defined such that metric become diagonal by the local coordinate transformation .",
    "the local quantum gravity starts from decomposition of @xmath3 as usual 3 + 1 sense .",
    "then we obtained the hamiltonian constraint and diffeomorphis constraint only in terms of the diagonal metric components .",
    "although the local quantum gravity only uses diagonal components of the metrics , boundary condition appears and this condition is still not well defined .",
    "we introduce what we call the up - to - down method in self - contained way and in more strict way more than the previous paper .",
    "some mistaken are corrected in this section .",
    "we should say some sentence is same as the previous paper .",
    "we start by introducing an additional dimension which is an external euclidean time with positive signature , and thus create an artificial functional space corresponding to this external time .",
    "we write such external dimension as @xmath4 .",
    "we dare to start with artificial 5-dimensional action whose metric is created from the usual 4-dimensional metric components and arbitrary additional dimensional components as , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the 5-dimensional ricci scalar .",
    "although we stat from higher dimensional action , we do not motivated from higher dimensional gravity .",
    "rewriting the action by a 4 + 1 slicing of the 5-dimensional spacetime with lapse functionals given by the @xmath4 direction , we obtain the 4 + 1 hamiltonian constraint and the diffeomorphism constraints as , @xmath7 where a hat means 4-dimensional , e.g. the @xmath8 is extrinsic curvature defined by @xmath9 and @xmath10 is its trace , while @xmath11 is the 4-dimensional ricci scalar , and @xmath12 is the 4-dimensional covariant derivative . +   + _ definition . _",

    "the definition of the canonical momentum @xmath18 is different from the usual one .",
    "note in fact that the above state in @xmath17 is not the usual 5-dimensional quantum gravity state , because the 4 + 1 slicing is along the @xmath4 direction .",
    "it is not defined by @xmath19 but by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the 5-dimensional lagrangian .",
    "although whether this state is the hilbert space or @xmath22 norm space is open question and this problem does not matter below , because what we would like to treat is the physical 4-dimensional quantum gravity state .",
    "in addition , we impose that 4-dimensional quantum gravity must be recovered from the above 5-dimensional action .",
    "the 3 + 1 hamiltonian constraint and diffeomorphism constraint are , @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the usual extrinsic curvature defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is its trace , while @xmath27 is the 3-dimensional ricci scalar , and @xmath28 is the 3-dimensional covariant derivative",
    ". then we can define a subset of the auxiliary hilbert space on which the wave functional satisfies the usual 4-dimensional constraints . in order to relate the 4 and 5 dimensional spaces we should define projections .",
    "+   + _ definition . _",
    "the subset of @xmath17 in which the five dimensional quantum state satisfies the extra constraints @xmath29 is called @xmath30 , where @xmath18 is the projection defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a functional space .",
    "and @xmath33 is the usual four dimensional state with the restriction that @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 stands for the 3-dimensional metric @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 the above definition contains some extra definition such as @xmath39 .",
    "these functional spaces never appear in the following discussion and whether these space is norm space is open question and does not matter .",
    "we concern that some confusion occur by these symbols .",
    "however , @xmath33 should be hilbert space and there are problems of the norm .",
    "this problem can not have been solved yet , even if we use the up - to - down method .    from now on we consider the recovery of the 4-dimensional vacuum quantum gravity from the 5-dimensional functional .",
    "we assume that the constraint , @xmath40 holes . here",
    "@xmath11 is the operator , corresponding to the usual 4-dimensional ricci scalar .",
    "we use this constraint for the recovery of 4-dimensional quantum gravity in the sense of dirac . and as we know in the previous paper physical meaning of this constraint is static restriction .",
    "then artificial 5-dimensional hamiltonian constraint becomes as @xmath41 we call this simplified 4 + 1 hamiltonian constraint as modified hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the simplification comes from the recovery of 4-dimensional quantum gravity i.e. @xmath42 .",
    "finally , the simplified hamiltonian constraint in terms of the canonical representation becomes @xmath43 the magic constant factor @xmath44 for the term @xmath45 is a consequence of the choice of the dimensions for @xmath46 . in the derivation of above formula we use the fact that the dimension of our universe is 4 with signature @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is the canonical momentum of the 4-dimensional metric @xmath49 , that is @xmath50 . and",
    "as we mentioned above , this canonical momentum is defined by the external time and not by the usual time .",
    "we now give a more detailed definition of the auxiliary 5-dimensional hilbert space as follows : +   + _ definition . _ the subset @xmath51 is defined by the constraints , @xmath52 , and we write its elements as @xmath53 .",
    "we also define a projection @xmath54 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a subset of @xmath33 .",
    "there are reason why we choose such projection @xmath54 .",
    "although there are the problem of measure , this definition of the projection does not produce any additional constraint in @xmath33 for the solution of @xmath57 .",
    "so the modified hamiltonian constraint and the 4 + 1 diffeomorphism constraint does not become additional constraint if they are projected by @xmath54 . +   + _ definition .",
    "_ in @xmath56 there is a subset whose state satisfy @xmath58 .",
    "we write such hilbert space as @xmath59 and its elements as @xmath60 .",

    "the @xmath18 and @xmath54 are same operation .",
    "however , projected space is different .",
    "the inverse projection @xmath54 can be defined by one - to - many way .",
    "although it is mathematically not well - defined , if we can find at least one enlargement , this method is correct . ]",
    "we carry on step 1 ) . at first",
    "we choose coordinate such that metric become diagonal because we treat local quantum gravity .",
    "then modified hamiltonian constraint at this limit becomes as , @xmath68 we can easily find the solution of this equation and one of the states is , @xmath69 $ ] for @xmath70 are functional of @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , if we use a 3 + 1 diffeomorphism constraints , we can know that the @xmath72 are only the function of @xmath71 at this point .",
    "however , we do not use this fact now .",
    "in this section we solve the local hamiltonian constraint equation without fixing spacetime metrics , i.e. without treating mini - superspace models .",
    "although this section motivated by the up - to - down method , what we derive in this section independently holeds .",
    "we use the fact that the metric becomes diagonal in the local coordinate .",
    "we start with assumption as , @xmath73=\\delta_{ij}q_{ii , k}f_j[q_{jj } ] \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for } \\ \\ \\ j\\not= i.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter separated solution is the superposition of three local solutions .",
    "the assumption ( 16 ) means that the eigenvalue of the @xmath74 of the state @xmath75 $ ] for @xmath76 is constant .",
    "the local hamiltonian constraint equation can be written as , @xmath77 where @xmath78 . the consistency of the additional constraint and the hamiltonian constraint is clear from the next commutation relation .",

    "this relation is same as the equation ( 16 ) , so the assumption ( 16 ) is consistent .",
    "if we insert the equation ( 15 ) , we obtain the following differential equation as , @xmath81   + \\sum_{j(\\not = i)}\\phi_{i , jj}e^{\\phi_i}f_i[\\phi_i]=0 \\ \\ \\ { \\rm for } \\ \\ \\ i=1,2,3.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] other components are dropped out because of the assumption ( 16 ) .",
    "the important point is the fact that the above equation is algebraically closed for @xmath82 .",
    "because we ignore the operator ordering , we can rewrite the above equation as , @xmath83 here , @xmath84 .",
    "we can find the solution of the above second order ordinal functional differential equation as , @xmath85=e_{1i}\\exp ( 2i\\int ( \\partial^j\\partial_j\\ln a_i)^{1/2}\\delta a_i ) + e_{2i}\\exp ( -2i\\int ( \\partial^j\\partial_j\\ln a_i)^{1/2}\\delta a_i ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath86 and @xmath87 are constants .",
    "then we can obtained the local hamiltonian constraint as , @xmath88 conclusion and discussions --------------------------",
    "we can find at least one local solution of the hamiltonian constraint . before the up - to - down method we do not know any solution of this equation .",
    "the peculiar problem in the quantum gravity is still unsolved .",
    "even if we use this method we can still not solve the problem of the norm and problem of the time @xcite .",
    "we should find all state to solve the problem of norm .",
    "otherwise we obtained one solution it may create other solutions .",
    "we hope such kinds of work succeed .    because our work succeeded the quantization of the inhomogeneous spacetime",
    ", we can enter this state symmetry for example spherical symmetry .",
    "then we may obtain the state of the black holes @xcite .",
    "or we can enter symmetry of the homogeneous and isotropy , as loop gravity @xcite .",
    "simple analysis is carried out by inserting symmetry in @xmath89 such that @xmath90 , where the @xmath91 is the function of only the time @xmath92 .",
    "then we can obtain a simple cosine wave .",
    "such cosine wave does not occur if the cosmological constant is zero .",
    "we can not find such wave from the mini - superspace approach .",
