    "<S> sometime ago , it has been proposed as an essential ingredient governing the driven translocation process  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a view seems to have been well validated in recent studies  @xcite .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we analyzed in detail the translocation dynamics based on two phase formalism , in which the portion of the translocation polymer in _ cis _ side is pictured to be composed of the moving and the yet quiescent equilibrium domains . </S>",
    "<S> the point of the formalism is to focus on the dynamics of the domain boundary , which is a gross variable describing how the driving force at the pore site is transmitted along the chain backbone . </S>",
    "<S> for such a coarse - graining to be meaningful , other degrees of freedom need to be properly eliminated , the effect of which should be reflected in the behaviors of the gross variable . </S>",
    "<S> most naturally , the moving domain is assumed to be in a steady - state with a characteristic velocity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the steady - state dynamical friction / extension laws are coupled to the continuum equation describing the conservation of the mass . in our earlier article  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we set @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents the segment velocity around the rear end of the moving domain . </S>",
    "<S> this steady - state ansatz , however , turned to be not compatible with the mass conservation relation inherent in the translocation process . </S>",
    "<S> this point was shortly mentioned in the appendix of our article  @xcite . to make the point clearer </S>",
    "<S> , we present a detailed account in this article , where our previous result  @xcite is modified by adopting an alternative steady - state ansatz suggested in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then point out that the alternative ansatz is intimately related with the iso - flux model  @xcite .        _ </S>",
    "<S> basic equations_ let us consider the driven translocation process as schematically depicted in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> a polymeric chain is initially dissolved in the solution ( @xmath3 ) , taking a random coil conformation with the overall size @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total segment number , @xmath6 is the segment length , and @xmath7 is the flory exponent . as those in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the length , force and time are made dimensionless by the units @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ( @xmath10 is the thermal energy ; @xmath11 is the viscosity of the solvent ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a thin wall at @xmath12 with a small pore , where the driving force with the constant magnitude @xmath13 is locally exerted in @xmath14-direction from the _ cis _ to the _ trans _ side . </S>",
    "<S> one chain end is sucked at time @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the translocation process , then , proceeds with the tension propagation along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> segments are numbered from the first sucked end to the other end ( @xmath5th segment ) . according to the so - called two phase formalism </S>",
    "<S> , the dynamics of driven translocation is described as the growth process of the moving tensed domain , which is specified by the segment @xmath16 at the end of the moving domain , the segment @xmath17 at the pore , the size @xmath18 and the representative ( or average ) velocity @xmath0 of the moving domain at time @xmath19 ( see fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these can be determined by the following set of equations : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the segment fluxes at the moving domain boundary and at the pore , respectively . as explained in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) is the continuum equation , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2 ] ) and  ( [ eq:3 ] ) are the dynamical equations of state describing the steady - state relation among velocity - extension - force ( eq .  </S>",

    "<S> _ ansatz ( ii)_ an alternative steady - state ansatz is to set @xmath51 as was done in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the tension propagation law and the propagation time in leading order can be expressed in the form of eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:3 ] ) and  ( [ eq:4 ] ) reveals a unique property of the moving domain in the translocation process . </S>",
    "<S> given the average relation eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the unique driving mode inherent in the translocation process is manifested in the iso - flux condition , which is to be contrasted with the mechanical driving by pulling chain end  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the scaling of the propagation time ( thus , the translocation time ) is given by @xmath91 it is somewhat puzzling that the prediction based on the ansatz  ( i ) seem to be better correlated with numerical and real experiments  @xcite . this might be ascribed to finite - size effects and various crossovers detailed in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> these effects may be enhanced in realistic situations due to the wall and/or the _ trans_-side effects , which would be dependent on the size and properties of the pore etc . since the pore flux would be sensitive to such specific pore effects , one </S>",
    "<S> may then be tempted to remove the pore flux ( eq .  </S>",

    "<S> if the outgoing flux @xmath92 is suppressed enough compared to that expected from the iso - flux condition , the description based on the steady - state ansatz  ( i ) may attain its apparent suitability . </S>",
    "<S> a very recent theoretical study based on a more  accurate \" two phase description seems to support such a view  @xcite , where it has been shown that the frictional interaction between the pore and the polymer significantly affects the dynamics for polymers with experimentally relevant , finite chain length . </S>"
