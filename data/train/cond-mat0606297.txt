    "the existence of superconducting states that break symmetries of the normal state beyond gauge symmetry has generated considerable interest .",
    "such unconventional pairing was first discovered in @xmath6he , in which the three superfluid phases all have spin - triplet ( @xmath7 ) atomic cooper pairs with relative orbital angular momentum @xmath8 ( @xmath5-wave).@xcite strong evidence for unconventional superconductivity was subsequently found in heavy - fermion materials.@xcite in the high-@xmath9 cuprates , phase - sensitive experiments have provided convincing evidence for @xmath10 ( @xmath11-wave ) spin - singlet pairing.@xcite the pairing symmetry in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , a non - cuprate perovskite oxide superconductor , has been unambiguously shown to be lower than the symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice , _ i.e. _ , @xmath12.@xcite it is generally believed that sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 is a triplet @xmath5-wave superconductor,@xcite though it has been noted that a @xmath11-wave singlet state is also possible.@xcite it has been suggested that some compounds could be superconductors with @xmath13.@xcite more exotic types of pairing , such as order parameters with odd - frequency dependence and mixed singlet - triplet cooper pairs , have also been considered for real materials.@xcite    by itself , the electron - phonon interaction is always attractive , and hence it maximizes the pairing energy for an order parameter that is positive everywhere on the fermi surface .",
    "conventional wisdom thus suggests that @xmath12 pairing symmetries must be induced by non - phonon mechanisms , such as magnetic or coulomb interactions .",
    "a number of authors have pointed out , however , that while phonons are always more pairing in the @xmath0 channel , they may also be pairing in other channels as well.@xcite if , for example , strong on - site coulomb repulsion suppresses @xmath0-wave pairing because of the large overlap of the wave functions of the paired particles , or if there is an additional pairing contribution in an @xmath14 channel from other ( non - phonon ) mechanisms , unconventional pairing that results mainly from electron - phonon coupling is possible . less well appreciated is the idea that a combination of electron - phonon coupling and another pairing interaction ( _ e.g. _ , spin - fluctuation exchange ) may result in a superconducting state that is not the ground state of either of the two interactions taken separately .    in this paper",
    "we consider a simple model , loosely based on sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , that illustrates this effect .",
    "the model assumes a highly two - dimensional electronic structure , and it includes a two - dimensional spin - fluctuation - induced interaction that favors @xmath11-wave pairing of @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) symmetry,@xcite and a three - dimensional electron - phonon interaction that favors an @xmath0-wave state . the spin interaction is based on the experimentally observed spin - fluctuation spectrum of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , which has negligible dispersion along @xmath17.@xcite while less is known about the electron - phonon coupling in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 , the three - dimensional nature of the crystal structure suggests that the electron - phonon interaction in the material may be much more three dimensional than the electronic structure itself . when the coupling strengths of the two interactions are comparable , we find that the symmetry of the emerging ground state can be changed by tuning the widths of the interactions . among the states that are found to be stable in certain regions of phase space",
    "are two - dimensional ( @xmath17-independent ) @xmath5-wave states and three - dimensional ( @xmath17-dependent ) singlet and triplet states , all of which arise from the interplay between the two interactions .",
    "the spin dependence of the pairing in a superconductor can be taken into account using a @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 to represent the gap function . within this spin matrix formalism ,",
    "the bcs gap equation has the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the matrix element of the effective electron - electron pairing interaction @xmath22 , for which we adopt a convention in which positive @xmath23 corresponds to an attractive interaction , and @xmath24 is a function of the temperature @xmath25 and the quasiparticle energy @xmath26.@xcite in a crystal with inversion symmetry , the pairing potential can be separated into spin - triplet ( + ) and spin - singlet ( - ) channels , @xmath27 where @xmath28 the gap equation decouples into separate equations for the singlet and triplet channels . for singlet pairing ,",
    "the gap matrix has the form @xmath29 , while for triplet pairing , it has the form @xmath30 i\\hat{\\sigma}_y$ ] , where @xmath31 are pauli spin matrices .",
    "since the total wave function must be antisymmetric under interchange of particles , the scalar order parameter @xmath32 for singlet pairing must be even in @xmath33 and the vector order parameter @xmath34 must have odd parity .",
    "near @xmath35 , the gap function is small and the gap equation can be linearized and reformulated as an eigenvalue problem : @xmath36 in the singlet channel , this becomes an eigenvalue problem for @xmath37 , with eigenfunctions given by the scalar order parameter @xmath32 .",
    "for triplet pairing , the eigenvectors of @xmath38 correspond to components of the vector order parameter @xmath34 . among eigenfunctions that have spatial symmetry compatible with the spin pairing",
    ", the one with the largest eigenvalue @xmath39 produces the first superconducting instability that manifests as temperature is lowered , and hence defines the physical @xmath9 .    in our model",
    ", the pairing potential has two contributions : an electron - phonon interaction @xmath40 that is always attractive regardless of the symmetry of the spin pairing , and an interaction @xmath41 that is mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "the latter is attractive in the triplet spin channel but repulsive in the singlet spin channel .",
    "therefore , the total pairing interaction is @xmath42 .",
    "the model system considered here is inspired by sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "a tetragonal , three - dimensional crystal structure with @xmath43 symmetry is assumed , with lattice constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the electronic structure is highly two - dimensional , with a cylindrical fermi surface of radius @xmath46 , similar to the @xmath47 sheet of the fermi surface in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is assumed to be three dimensional in nature while the antiferromagnetic - spin - fluctuation - induced interaction is two dimensional .",
    "both interactions depend only on @xmath48 .",
    "the spin - fluctuation - induced interaction @xmath49 is taken to be an isotropic gaussian in @xmath50 and @xmath51 , centered on @xmath52 and equivalent lines in the brillouin zone [ _ i.e. _ , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , in accordance with both theory@xcite and experiment.@xcite the electron - phonon interaction @xmath56 is a three - dimensional gaussian function centered at @xmath57 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction is allowed to be anisotropic , with a different width in the @xmath17 direction than in the plane .",
    "the anisotropy of the electron - phonon interaction is characterized by the parameter @xmath58 , where the widths are defined in terms of the gaussian form @xmath59 $ ] .    because the fermi surface in the model is perfectly cylindrical and the interaction potentials are separable in cartesian coordinates , the eigenvalue problem separates into @xmath17 and planar parts , with product eigenfunctions .",
    "the in - plane eigenfunctions are of the form @xmath60 and @xmath61 , while the @xmath17 eigenfunctions are of the form @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are integers and @xmath66 . for @xmath67 ,",
    "the two - dimensional spin interaction cancels out since @xmath68 if @xmath41 has no @xmath17 dependence .",
    "this means there are degenerate spin - triplet and spin - singlet states that have the same in - plane eigenfunction .",
    "the symmetry of the in - plane eigenfunction determines which one has the cosine solution and which one has the sine solution in @xmath69 . in a real material ,",
    "this degeneracy between triplet and singlet states would be broken by a variety of effects , including warping of the fermi surface and the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "numerical calculations were carried out using a discrete grid of @xmath33 points on the fermi surface .",
    "the circumference of the fermi surface was sampled with 40 equally spaced grid points , while 20 points were used along @xmath69 .",
    "the grid was selected so that the spacing between grid points was small compared to the the widths of the interactions .",
    "we have also checked convergence by increasing the number of grid points to @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the effective strength of each interaction in coupling electrons on the fermi surface is measured by @xmath72 for fixed ratios of @xmath73 , phase diagrams were mapped out as a function of interaction widths . because of the discrete sampling of * k*-points , results are presented only for interactions with gaussian width greater that @xmath74 in the plane . to construct the phase diagrams , we used a recursive algorithm that takes advantage of the fact that most phases occupy large regions in phase space .",
    "the gap equation is solved for all points along the border of the rectangular phase diagram .",
    "if the ground state is the same at all points on the border , all points in the interior are assumed to have the same ground state . otherwise , the region is divided into two rectangles and the process is repeated recursively . for each phase diagram , phase space was sampled with a range of resolutions , from @xmath75 to @xmath76 points , to mitigate the chance of missing phases that might be stable in only small interior regions of the diagram .",
    "we consider first the case when one of the interactions dominates .",
    "when the spin coupling is much larger than the phonon coupling ( @xmath77 ) , only one phase appears regardless of the widths of the spin and phonon interactions .",
    "this is the singlet @xmath78 state ( commonly denoted @xmath79 ) .",
    "because the spin interaction is repulsive in the singlet channel , to induce pair formation , it must scatter electrons between points * k * and * k@xmath80 * on the fermi surface that have order parameter of opposite sign ( see eq . [ eq : gapeq2 ] ) . for @xmath78 symmetry ,",
    "three of the four lines in the brillouin zone on which the spin interaction is maximal do this ; the fourth couples nodal regions .",
    "hence this @xmath11-wave state is stabilized by the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "when the phonon interaction dominates ( @xmath81 ) , only an @xmath0-wave spin singlet appears in the phase diagram .",
    "this is expected since the attractive electron - phonon interaction is pair forming when the order parameter has the same sign at points * k * and * k@xmath80 * on the fermi surface .     and electron - phonon anisotropy @xmath82 .",
    "see table [ tab : states ] for the symmetry of states that appear in this phase diagram .",
    "[ fig : phase1],width=2 ]    figure [ fig : phase1 ] shows the phase diagram for equal spin and phonon coupling strengths ( @xmath83 ) . in the diagram , the width of the spin - fluctuation - induced interaction increases from left to right , and the width of the electron - phonon interaction increases from top to bottom .",

    "this can be understood from the form of the spin interaction . in the triplet channel , the spin - fluctuation - mediated interaction is attractive , so to induce pairing it must scatter electrons between points on the fermi surface that have order parameters of the same sign .",
