    "the study of interactions between holes ( or gaps ) in dimer systems was established by fisher and stephenson  @xcite in 1963 with their results concerning interactions of holes in dimer systems on the square lattice .",
    "three specific types of interaction were presented : the interaction between a pair of dimer holes ( that is , the interaction of two fixed dimers within a dimer system ) ; the interaction between a pair of non - dimer holes ( that is , the interaction between two fixed monomers in a dimer system ) ; and the interaction of a dimer hole with a constrained boundary .",
    "kenyon  @xcite generalised the first of these results to an arbitrary number of dimer holes in dimer systems on both the square and hexagonal lattices . in  @xcite",
    "kenyon , okounkov and sheffield further extended this work to general planar bipartite lattices .",
    "the interaction of a monomer with a straight line boundary in the square lattice is also due to kenyon  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.5 ) , while the interaction of a family of holes with a constrained straight line boundary on the hexagonal lattice is tackled by ciucu in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2 ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that since the triangular lattice arises as the `` dual '' of the hexagonal lattice , dimer coverings of subgraphs of the hexagonal lattice are often much more easily thought of in terms of unit rhombus tilings of sub - regions of the triangular lattice in the plane ( so monomers correspond to unit triangles and dimers correspond to unit rhombi ) .",
    "a dimer covering of the entire hexagonal lattice then corresponds to a tiling of the entire plane by unit rhombi ( sometimes referred to as a sea of unit rhombi ) .",
    "ciucu has also studied various types of interactions between non - dimer holes in dimer systems on the hexagonal lattice ( equivalently , interactions between triangular holes within a sea of unit rhombi  @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) , thereby establishing close analogies to certain electrostatic phenomena .",
    "ciucu conjectures that interactions between holes in dimer systems on the hexagonal lattice are governed by the laws of two dimensional electrostatics ( that is , coulomb s laws ) .",
    "more specifically , the conjecture states that by taking the exponential of the negative of the electrostatic energy of the two dimensional system of physical charges obtained by considering each hole as a point charge of size and magnitude specified by a statistic on the unit triangular lattice , @xmath3 is defined to be the signed difference between the number of left and right - pointing unit triangles that comprise @xmath4 . ]",
    "@xmath5 , one may recover ( up to a multiplicative constant ) asymptotic expressions for the dimer - mediated interactions of holes on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "this conjecture remains wide open , though it has been shown to hold for two fairly general families of holes .    in light of this , further types of interaction have been studied . recently in  @xcite , ciucu and krattenthaler determined the interaction between a left - pointing triangular hole of side length two and a vertical free boundary that borders a sea of unit rhombi on the left half of the plane .",
    "it would appear that this result ( which inspired the present paper ) is the first treatment of such an interaction in the literature .",
    "theorem  [ thm : vertcor ] below is a direct analogy of the interaction presented in  @xcite in the sense that here the hole has been `` flipped '' and instead points toward the free boundary .",
    "curiously , theorem  [ thm : vertcor ] agrees with that of  @xcite only up to a multiplicative constant .    as well as theorem  [ thm : vertcor ]",
    ", this paper establishes two other types of interaction between a pair of triangular holes of side length two that point towards each other in dimer systems ( that is , a pair of triangles oriented so that one left - pointing triangle lies directly to the right of one right - pointing triangle ) .",
    "these interactions are : the interaction between such a pair of holes that lie within a sea of unit rhombi ( theorem  [ thm : compcorr ] ) ; and the interaction between such a pair of holes that lie on a fixed boundary of a sea of unit rhombi ( theorem  [ thm : horzcor ] ) .",
    "all three of these results agree with the original conjecture of ciucu and so serve as yet more evidence that interactions between holes in dimer systems are governed by the laws of two dimensional electrostatics .",
    "a brief outline of the paper follows .",
    "section  [ sec : setup ] discusses the correspondence between dimer systems on the hexagonal lattice and rhombus tilings of hexagons on the triangular lattice , and also states precisely the family of holey hexagons ( that is , hexagons containing triangular holes ) that are of particular interest .",
    "certain symmetry classes of rhombus tilings of a holey hexagon correspond precisely to rhombus tilings of smaller sub - regions of the same hexagon .",
    "the three different types of interaction that are the focus of this work arise from considering tilings of these sub - regions as they become infinitely large .",
    "these sub - regions are defined in section  [ sec : setup ] , along with the corresponding interactions ( or correlation functions ) .",
    "asymptotic expressions for these interactions are also stated here ( theorem  [ thm : compcorr ] , theorem  [ thm : vertcor ] , and theorem  [ thm : horzcor ] ) , which together comprise the main results .",
    "proposition  [ thm : matchfac] a factorisation result that is frequently used throughout this paper is also stated in this section .",
    "section  [ sec : enumform ] briefly discusses the relationship between rhombus tilings of hexagons and plane partitions .",
    "this is followed by four exact enumeration formulas that count tilings of sub - regions of holey hexagons ( theorem  [ thm : vertexact ] , theorem  [ thm : horzexact ] , theorem  [ thm : horzwexact ] , and theorem  [ thm : hexact ] ) .",
    "proofs of these theorems follow in sections  [ sec : nonint ] and  [ sec : eval ] .    in section  [ sec : nonint ] the well - known bijection between rhombus tilings and non - intersecting lattice paths",
    "is combined with existing results due to stembridge  @xcite and lindstrm - gessel - viennot  @xcite in order to express the number of tilings of different regions as either a pfaffian ( proposition  [ prop : vertmat ] ) or a determinant ( proposition  [ prop : horzmat ] , proposition  [ prop : horzwmat ] ) . in section  [ sec : eval ] the matrices defined in proposition  [ prop : vertmat ] are manipulated using standard row and column operations in such a way that the pfaffian of each matrix may be expressed as a determinant of a much smaller matrix .",
    "the unique @xmath6-decompositions of these smaller matrices , along with those from proposition  [ prop : horzmat ] and proposition  [ prop : horzwmat ] , are then stated and proved ( theorem  [ thm : vertlu ] , lemma  [ thm : horzwlu ] , theorem  [ thm : vertoddlu ] , and theorem  [ thm : horzlu ] ) , from which the exact enumeration formulas in section  [ sec : enumform ] immediately follow .",
    "section  [ sec : asym ] contains proofs of the main results .",
    "these follow from inserting the enumeration formulas from section  [ sec : enumform ] into the correlation functions defined in section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "asymptotic expressions for the three types of interaction are then derived by studying these correlation functions as the distance between the holes ( or the distance between the hole and the free boundary ) becomes very large .",
    "consider the hexagonal lattice @xmath7 in terms of its dual @xmath8 ( that is , the planar triangular lattice consisting of unit equilateral triangles drawn so that one of the sets of lattice lines is vertical ) .",
    "then monomers on @xmath7 correspond to unit triangles on @xmath8 and dimers on @xmath7 correspond to unit rhombi on @xmath8 ( a dimer on @xmath7 is equivalent to joining two unit triangles that share exactly one edge on @xmath8 ) .",
    "it follows that dimer coverings of regions of @xmath7 that contain gaps correspond exactly to rhombus tilings of regions of @xmath8 that contain triangular holes .",
