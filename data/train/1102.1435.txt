    "the manganite family of mn - oxide materials has attracted considerable attention mainly due to the colossal magnetoresistance effect , where a magnetic field hugely enhances the electrical conductivity .",
    "@xcite more recently , multiferroicity has been found in some members of this family , particularly when chemical substitution reduces the bandwidth of the mobile electrons .",
    "magnetic multiferroicity , where a ferroelectric ( fe ) polarization is induced by the magnetic order , has lately been intensively investigated .",
    "@xcite furthermore , manganites provide a fertile ground to study various ordered phases where magnetic , orbital , and charge degrees of freedom interact and compete . as a result of the large number of tendencies simultaneously active on comparable energy scales , phases with very different physical properties",
    "can nevertheless be very close in energy .",
    "@xcite    the competition of all these active degrees of freedom often leads to `` striped '' phases where electron motion is confined to one - dimensional ( 1d ) subspaces . in manganites at large hole doping ,",
    "for example , electrons mainly occupy orbitals that point along either the @xmath4 or the @xmath5 direction .",
    "spins then order ferromagnetically along this direction , because this favors the electronic kinetic energy via the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism . in the other direction , where the electronic motion is suppressed , then de is not active , and antiferromagnetic ( af ) superexchange dominates .",
    "this establishes af spin correlations , leading to the `` spin striped '' @xmath6-type af phase .",
    "@xcite other examples involve the ferromagnetic ( fm ) zigzag chains , which are antiferromagnetically coupled among themselves , that form the well - known ce - af phase at half filling or the @xmath7-af phase in the undoped - limit .",
    "@xcite the ground state of these phases usually have collinear magnetic order , i.e. , alignment between any two spins is either perfectly fm or af . another aspect to note",
    "is that while the electronic kinetic energy is 1d , the magnetic order is fully two dimensional ( 2d ) , with af order between the chains mediated by superexchange ( se ) . in the absence of af se , a completely fm state with 2d electron motion",
    "is energetically favorable .",
    "recently , some of us predicted the existence of a new multiferroic phase , dubbed _ spin - orthogonal stripe _ ( sos ) phase , located in the previously unexplored region of quarter - hole - doping , small jahn - teller electron - lattice coupling , and narrow @xmath8-electrons bandwidth .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the `` striped '' phases mentioned above , the competition between fm de and af se stabilizes _ non - collinear _ magnetic order on some bonds , where the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) @xmath9 spins are orthogonal to one another . as in an analogous half - doped noncollinear phase ,  @xcite this competition",
    "is expected to lead to a relatively high multiferroic critical temperature ( @xmath10  k ) .",
    "these phases can be visualized as composed of `` thick '' stripes , where all magnetic correlations within a stripe are collinear , i.e. , af or fm , while adjacent stripes display non - collinear spins .    in the present publication",
    ", we report that the sos phase described above , as well as similar phases at dopings @xmath11 with integer @xmath12 , have another unexpected property , namely a very highly degenerate ground - state manifold .",
    "we find that the spins of any collinear stripe can be rotated without a significant change in energy , as long as the spins in adjacent stripes remain orthogonal .",
    "spins in next - nearest - neighbor stripes can thus be at arbitrary angles relative to each other , implying that there is no magnetic order in the direction perpendicular to the stripes . analogous _ dimensional reduction _",
    "effects on the magnetic order , where a higher - dimensional ( 2d in our case ) spin system decouples into lower - dimensional ( 1d ) subsystems , have been experimentally observed in other contexts such as near a quantum - critical point .",
    "@xcite three - dimensional spin - ice systems  @xcite also show macroscopic degeneracy , and they can decouple into 2d planes when a magnetic field `` switches off '' some spins connecting the planes .",
    "@xcite    in contrast to spin ice , where a local symmetry allows two states for each tetrahedron , leading to a macroscopic ground - state degeneracy and an extensive entropy proportional to the system size @xmath13 , the near degeneracy reported here is not quite macroscopic .",
    "the degeneracy involves flipping or rotating whole stripes , and the number of stripes in the 2d plane grows with the square root of the system size .",
    "this indicates that the emergent degeneracy of the ground state is intermediate between local and global .",
    "similar intermediate symmetry effects connected to dimensional reduction have been extensively discussed in orbital - only models , as well as in the context of quantum computation .",
    "an example is the so - called `` compass - model '' where the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) components of the orbital pseudo - spins are coupled ising - like in the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) direction .",
    "this model was originally introduced to capture the frustrated hoppings of the @xmath8 orbitals of manganites .",
    "@xcite its low - energy states are ordered along only one dimension ,  @xcite implying a symmetry that , again , is intermediate between local and global .",
    "@xcite    even though the compass model was originally suggested to model the frustration inherent in degenerate @xmath8 orbitals in 2d , the actual ( partially frustrated ) hamiltonian describing these orbitals does not exhibit such a high degeneracy .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the peculiar properties of the compass model are sensitive to even rather slight modifications of the hamiltonian and that a unique ground state with alternating orbital order sets in easily when the model is modified towards a more realistic description of 2d @xmath8 systems .",
    "@xcite in three dimensions , on the other hand , the model with a realistic @xmath8-orbital structure does decouple into _ planes _",
    ",  @xcite as long as the magnetic order is fully fm .",
    "once the magnetic degree of freedom in included , however , the ground state turns out to show af order along the @xmath14 direction .",
    "this changes the relevant orbital hamiltonian and as a consequence three - dimensional spin - orbital order with a non - degenerate ground state is stabilized .",
    "in addition to the @xmath8 orbital degrees of freedom in manganites , heavier elements with a strong relativistic spin - orbit interaction were discussed as a possible realization of compass models .",
    "@xcite however , here an isotropic heisenberg term due to hund s coupling would likely be present as well ,  @xcite again inducing 2d order without @xmath15 degeneracy .",
    "@xcite finally , it was pointed out that the compass model describes properties desired for fault - tolerant qbits ,  @xcite and coupled josephson - junction arrays have been implemented for this purpose .  @xcite    the directional ordering described by the compass model is thus potentially very interesting , but dedicated josephson - junction arrays appear so far the only systems showing such an effect . in the condensed - matter systems",
    "conjectured to display this physics based on particular features of their low - energy hamiltonians , additional - even rather small  @xcite - perturbations , as often present in realistic descriptions of materials , have thus far been found to lift the high degeneracy .",
    "it has been suggested that the _ opposite _ route might work , i.e. that a more complex hamiltonian , which does not itself have the appropriate symmetry intermediate between local and global , might still support a ground - state manifold that _ has _ such symmetries.@xcite as mentioned above , some experimental evidence of such behavior exists ,  @xcite and a similar effect is known in the case of spin - ice .",
    "@xcite however , we are not aware of any model where `` compass - like '' behavior has been shown to emerge effectively for the ground - state manifold .",
    "we present here an unbiased numerical study showing this to happen in a hamiltonian realistic for manganites , in a particular region of parameter space .",

    "[ sec : methods ] , the numerical techniques are presented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we show that the 2d spin system effectively decomposes into uncoupled 1d stripes , while the electronic kinetic energy remains fully 2d .",
    "we also discuss orbital occupation and the relation between the magnetic degeneracy and dispersionless electronic states .",
    "the hamiltonian considered here has been extensively studied in the past decade , and it has been shown to be very helpful to understand the complex behavior of manganites .",
    "in particular , the model reproduces the large variety of phases observed in manganites , e.g. @xmath16-type af , @xmath6-type af , fm , ce - af , or @xmath7-af , and also the colossal - magnetoresistance regime .",
    "@xcite the hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 the first term gives the kinetic energy of electrons in the two @xmath8 orbitals , containing the electronic hopping on nn bonds @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20 along the @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions ( we study a 2d lattice for simplicity ) .",
    "the operator @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath23 and at orbital @xmath24 , where the orbital indices @xmath24 and @xmath25 run over the @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbitals of the mn ions .",

    "@xcite the lattice distortions are thus coupled to the orbital degree of freedom .",

    "[ fig : con_stripes ] .",
    "since it only acts on the directional orbitals , which are not involved in the @xmath126 states , the latter are not affected and remain dispersionless in the sos@xmath61 phase . in the `` sos@xmath92 '' phase ,",
    "@xcite the @xmath7-phase domains are too narrow to support dispersionless states and in the modified phase of fig .",
    "[ sos3](c ) , where the `` arrows '' of the @xmath7-phase point in opposite directions in adjacent domains , the different orbital pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ co3_wrong ] also prevents similar dispersionless states .",
    "such a protection of a large ground - state degeneracy by dispersionless states is reminiscent of spin ice , where flat bands enforce the ice rules .",
    "@xcite the notion that the protection of a degeneracy is caused by the dispersionless states at @xmath128 can be motivated by observing that the lack of dispersion implies that the states are completely localized and do not communicate with other , dispersive , states .",
    "the energy of the occupied subband centered around @xmath129 can then only be affected by processes involving the symmetric unoccupied states at @xmath130 .",
    "treating the hybridization between these two subbands in perturbation theory , valid for large energy differences @xmath131 , the second order contribution can be shown to be independent of the hopping s complex phase and the third order contribution drops out entirely .",
    "if hybridization sensitive to the berry phase then occurs almost exclusively within the occupied subband , the individual one - particle energies seen in the density of states can be changed , but the total energy can not , because all energy gained by one state is lost by another .",
    "the @xmath7-af phase , which provides the stripe building blocks , displays fe polarization due to exchange - striction .",
    "@xcite additionally , the many bonds with non - collinear spins leads to a sizable dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "we found that the fe polarization caused by the latter is larger in some configurations and smaller in others .",
    "this causes an additional energy difference , but as long as it is small compared to the energy separating the sos@xmath61 ground - state manifold from excited states , this should not qualitatively alter the physical behavior that we described here . on the other hand , the different fe properties might provide a handle to manipulate the stripes .",
    "it should finally be noted that the multiferroic properties of a large collection of nearly degenerate states differing by the fe polarization has not been investigated thus far and may be highly non - trivial due to potential interference effects .    to conclude , we have studied a model hamiltonian appropriate for narrow - band manganites at small jahn - teller coupling using unbiased numerical techniques .",
    "we found that the spins of the 2d system spontaneously undergo dimensional reduction into 1d stripes for dopings @xmath76 , @xmath132 , @xmath68 adjacent stripes always have spins at a 90@xmath77 angle , but the spins of stripes at larger distances are not correlated .",
    "the electronic kinetic energy , on the other hand , remains fully 2d .",
    "this indicates that the manganite results described here induce the spins to behave in a way analogous to the ( orbital pseudo- ) spins in the so - called compass model , which is also used to describe protected qbits .",
