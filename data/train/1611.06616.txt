    "more importantly , we find that in the second stage the ion reflections may take place in two different scenarios . in the first scenario , a great number of ions can be reflected at the laser - plasma interface as in the first stage .",
    "these reflected ions will form an ion beam that propagates faster than the laser pulse . during the propagation of this ion beam in the background plasma",

    "it illuminates that in a near critical density plasma the collisionless shock generation is not sensitive to the laser intensity .    if the laser intensity @xmath75 ; however , we find no obvious evidence of the shock generation in our simulations .",

    "as a result , the laser pulse can propagate very fast during the whole laser - plasma interaction , and the ion reflections become very difficult in this case .",
    "on the other hand , if the initial laser intensity is too low , the forward velocity of the laser front will be not so high in comparison with the plasma thermal velocity .",

    "<S> laser - driven collisonless electrostatic shock formation and the subsequent ion acceleration have been studied in near critical density plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> particle - in - cell simulations show that both the speed of laser - driven collisionless electrostatic shock and the energies of shock - accelerated ions can be greatly enhanced due to fast laser propagation in near critical density plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> however , a response time longer than tens of laser wave cycles is required before the shock formation in a near critical density plasma , in contrast to the quick shock formation in a highly overdense target . </S>",
    "<S> more important , we find that some ions can be reflected by the collisionless shock even if the electrostatic potential jump across the shock is smaller than the ion kinetic energy in the shock frame , which seems against the conventional ion - reflection condition . </S>",
    "<S> these anomalous ion reflections are attributed to the strongly time - oscillating electric field accompanying laser - driven collisionless shock in a near critical density plasma . </S>"
