    "because the peak of the thermal dust emission occurs in the far - infrared ( 60 - 200 @xmath3 m ) for galactic interstellar clouds , this wavelength domain is recognized as a very important  window  to study the interstellar medium , both in the milky way and in external galaxies . however , due to the lack of spatial resolution provided by telescopes operating at these wavelengths , the interpretation of the signals measured in external galaxies is still a subject of controversy .",
    "the debate is focussed on the origins of the heating of dust grains and of the @xmath8 c@xmath9 line at 158 @xmath3 m .",
    "this fine structure line of ionized carbon is one of the main cooling lines of neutral atomic gas ( wolfire et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but it is also seen in hii regions , with different excitation mechanisms in these two cases .",

    "the photodissociation of carbon monoxide creates a layer of ionized carbon at the edge of the molecular cloud , which is a source of intense c@xmath9 emission .",
    "the far infrared emission is produced by dust grains heated by star light but the relative contribution of young massive stars on one hand , and of the bulk of the stellar population on the other hand , are still debated ( see e.g. walterbos & greenawalt @xcite , devereux & young @xcite , cox & mezger @xcite , thronson et al .",

    "it is difficult to find spiral galaxies dominated by a single population of heating sources , since the relative contributions of massive stars and of the disk population vary from galaxy to galaxy , and probably from place to place in a given galaxy .",
    "a main problem of these studies is the lack of spatial resolution at far infrared wavelengths .",
    "even when it is possible to use high spatial resolution data at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths , the gap in spatial resolution from the local interstellar clouds to external galaxies is huge : for nearby galaxies located at distances @xmath10 of a few mpc , a one arcmin beam encompasses @xmath11 , much larger than the size of a single molecular complex in the galaxy , whereas structures down to 0.01 pc are commonly observed in local clouds ( falgarone et al .",

    "@xcite ) , the radius of a 10@xmath15 m@xmath17 cloud is then 3 pc .",
    "another constraint on the spatial resolution is provided by the size of ob associations , which is generally larger than 30 pc ( garmany ) and their distance from molecular clouds .",

    "the total dynamical range of the uv radiation field extends over more than 4 orders of magnitude .",

    "we have used an earlier epoch of the simulation , when the distribution of gas clouds is axisymmetric .",
    "we have kept the same value for the other parameters ( number of ob associations , star formation rate , etc . ) . in that case , the clouds occupy a larger fraction volume of the galactic disk , and the mean distance between clouds increases . because of this larger mean distance between clouds , the opacity at 1000   decreases to 0.47 .",

    "we have evaluated the respective contributions of the uv radiation from massive stars and of the radiation field from the old stellar population .",

    "other important parameters are the number of ob associations and the sizes of hii regions , because with a large number of ob associations or with small hii regions , molecular clouds are on average closer to massive stars , and are thus more efficiently heated .    in all the models we ran",

    "<S> the close spatial association of massive stars and molecular clouds has a profound impact on the transfer of uv radiation in the galactic disk and on the dust emission . </S>",
    "<S> the median distance travelled by uv photons is about 120 pc . </S>",
