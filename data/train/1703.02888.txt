    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) from atoms and molecules in intense laser fields has been proved to be an important technique for producing coherent high - energy attosecond pulse trains as well as single isolated attosecond pulses [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "the mechanism of hhg process can be interpreted by a three - step semiclassical model [ 4 - 6 ] : first , under an intense laser field , the bound state electron tunnels through the coulomb barrier into continuum , then the freed electron accelerates in the external laser field and finally it may recombine into the ground state due to the phase change of the electric field followed by attosecond burst of electromagnetic waves emission . in many cycle laser fields this process occurs every half - cycle and generates attosecond pulse trains which due to the interference of these attosecond pulses there is a frequency comb with an interval of twice the driving field photon energy . in recent years , generation of isolated pulses with very short duration has gained enormous interest and much effort has been paid to achieve single attosecond pulses with long pulse lasers as they are easier to access . for example , it has been proposed to manipulate two - color laser fields [ 7 - 11 ] so that a continuum spectrum in the cutoff region of hhg spectra can be generated .",
    "another alternative approach to generate isolated attosecond pulses is using of polarization gating of ultrashort pulses as suggested by corkum and his collaborators [ 12 ] .",
    "the polarization gating is based on the dependence of the high harmonic generation efficiency on the ellipticity of the laser .",
    "the gating is applies with laser pulses whose ellipticity changes from circular to linear and conversely . in this created field",
    ", the electron will be driven away from the nucleus , in the head and tail parts , and in the center portion of the pulse , which is defined as the polarization gate , single attosecond pulses can be generated without spatial filtering .",
    "chang [ 13 ] has investigated polarization gating in atoms via semiclassical theory .",
    "this method mainly takes ground and continuum states into account and both the ionization and recombination processes occur in the ground state .",
    "however , recent studies have shown that not only the ground state but the excited states contribute to the hhg spectrum [ 14 - 15 ] .",
    "on the other hand , hhg from molecules shows some differences compared to that from atomic systems , such as two - center interference and a double - plateau structure [ 16 - 17 ] .",
    "typical molecular hhg spectra exhibit a narrow and a broad plateau at low and high frequencies respectively . in the broad part of the plateau ,",
    "the efficiency exceeds that of the atomic - like one by several orders of magnitude . in molecular high - order harmonic generation ,",
    "the ionized electron can recombine with neighboring ions in the same molecule leading to a much larger cutoff energy depending on the internuclear distance .",
    "this larger cutoff energy comes from longer acceleration distance in the recombination process . with the advantage of the high intensity of the molecular plateau and larger cutoff energy ,",
    "the molecular hhg could be an important topic of research to achieve an isolated attosecond laser pulse .",
    "ge _ at al .",
    "_ [ 18 ] have shown that an isolated attosecond pulse with duration 129 as could be generated from the h@xmath0 molecule in 3-fs , 800-nm laser pulses . also , recent studies proposed that , single circularly and elliptically attosecond pulses , which are potential new tools for investigation of electron dynamics inside atoms and molecules , could be produced by molecules exposed to the intense laser pulses with a time - dependent ellipticity [ 19 - 20 ] .",
    "yuan and bandrauk [ 21 ] have been generated a single circularly polarized 114 as pulse from the interaction of h@xmath0 molecule with an elliptically polarized laser pulse at a wavelength of 400 nm in the presence of a terahertz field .",
