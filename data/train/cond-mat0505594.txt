    "quantum spin chains are in fact three - dimensional magnetic compounds in which the magnetic interaction in one direction dominates over the  two others .",
    "they are not mere academic curiosities since many real - world compounds do have this property .",
    "one such compound is kcuf@xmath3 , a satisfactory realization of the one - dimensional spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model @xcite",
    ". early description of its crystallographic properties  @xcite confirms that it comes in two types , ( a ) and ( d ) @xcite , both with similar spin structures .",
    "the ( antiferromagnetic ) coupling constant along the chain direction is roughly 100 times stronger than the ( ferromagnetic ) interchain coupling constant , a feature confirmed by electron - spin resonance measurements .",
    "this justifies amply a dominant one - dimensional behavior , and additional specific heat measurements are consistent with this interpretation .",
    "also , an ideal strict one - dimensional magnetic chain will not exhibit long - range order at any finite temperature @xmath4 @xcite , but realistic quasi - one - dimensional systems have a characteristic temperature below which there is long - range order .",
    "for example , in kcuf@xmath3 long - range order is manifest below 38k for type ( a ) and 20k for type ( d ) @xcite .",
    "though presumably simpler than higher - dimensional systems , quantum spin chains show strong and rich quantum behavior .",
    "if for example we consider antiferromagnetic systems , we would classically anticipate a nel state traversed by spin - waves , and ( linear ) spin - wave theory is traditionally the usual framework for such a description . in this context , the excitation spectrum for the one - dimensional antiferromagnetic heisenberg model is predicted to be @xcite:@xmath5where @xmath6 is the momentum transfer along the chain direction and here , the magnetic coupling constant is normalized to unity for convenience .",
    "but the true ground state is actually different from the nel state @xcite , and the lowest - lying excited states satisfy the so - called des - cloizeaux - pearson ( dcp ) dispersion relation @xcite:@xmath7at first , these excitations were understood as spin - wave - like states with spin one and early experiments on cpc endoh - shirane - birgeneau - richards - holt , heilmann - shirane - endoh - birgeneau - holt and kcuf@xmath3 hutchings - ikeda - milne , satija - axe - shirane - yoshizawa - hirakawa were interpreted as a confirmation of this .",
    "but it was later shown faddeev - takhtajan , fowler that the natural excitations of the model have spin 1/2 and hence are fermions .",
    "these elementary excitations are called spinons @xcite and come always in pair . furthermore ,",
    "if the spin of the system is an integer , the spinons are bound and lead to well - defined spin - wave - like modes exhibiting a haldane gap @xcite , a feature not seen in the ( linear ) spin - wave theory . if the spin is a half - integer , the spinons are unbound and there is no haldane gap .",
    "spin 1/2 compounds are even more interesting in that the spectrum is not simply given by a definite dispersion relation and indeed , analytic @xcite and finite chain bonner - sutherland - richards calculations showed that it is actually a continuum of excitations confined to first approximation , for a given @xmath6 , between a lower bound @xmath8 and an upper bound @xmath9 such that:@xmath10    the ground state properties and more particularly the excitation spectrum of a magnetic system are analyzed using inelastic neutron scattering , the cross - section of which is a function of the energy and momentum transfers @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively @xcite .",
    "all the above mentioned features regarding the heisenberg model are confirmed by experiments .",
    "for example , inelastic neutron scattering on kcuf@xmath3 shows significant contribution to the scattering from regions consistent with the spin - wave continuum ( [ 2 spinon continuum ] ) and not with linear spin - wave theory , most particularly at high frequencies nagler - tennant - cowley - perring - satija .",
    "this implies the inadequacy of spin - wave theory @xcite at such high energies in the quantum limit @xmath13 , this even if the two - magnon interactions are taken into account beyond the linear approximation holstein - primakoff , tennant - nagler - welz - shirane - yamada .",
    "but there is consistency at low - energies , and one must mention that spin - wave theory works fine for compounds with high spins ( classical limit ) like kfes@xmath14 with @xmath15 where it gives accurate peak positions , line shapes and relative intensities @xcite .",
    "one should also note that inelastic neutron scattering on kcuf@xmath3 showed consistency of the field theory approach @xcite , valid only at long wavelengths , particularly the temperature dependence of the scattering tennant - perring - cowley - nagler , tennant - cowley - nagler - tsvelik .",
    "this is important because it is an additional confirmation of the fermionic nature of the elementary excitations , the spinons .    the inelastic neutron scattering is theoretically analyzed with the help of the two - point dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) @xmath1 , for , in the born approximation which is amply sufficient for the present purposes , the differential cross - section per scattering solid angle @xmath16 and outgoing neutron energy @xmath17 is @xcite:@xmath18@xmath19 is the number of scatterers , @xmath20b a unit for magnetic scattering , @xmath21 the land factor , @xmath22 the magnetic form factor , @xmath23 the outgoing and @xmath24  the incoming neutron momenta respectively",
    ", @xmath25 and @xmath26 the cartesian coordinates .",
    "the dsf @xmath1 is the fourier transform of the two - point spin correlation function:@xmath27 } \\,\\left\\langle s_{l}^{i}\\left ( 0\\right ) s_{m}^{j}\\left ( t\\right ) \\right\\rangle ,   \\label{definition dsf}\\]]where @xmath28 is the position of the spin @xmath29 on the chain .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to the antiferromagnetic isotropic heisenberg model commutes with the total spin operator , which implies that @xmath30 is diagonal in @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath31 is the same for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the averaging in ( [ definition dsf ] ) is generally done at finite temperature , but at low temperatures , only the ground state is retained .",
    "also , for a quasi - one - dimensional system , the cross - section for neutron scattering with momentum transfer @xmath12 depends only on the component @xmath6 of @xmath12 parallel to the chain .",
    "historically , the first attempts to calculate the dsf for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model were made in the context of spin - wave theory which , for the chain lying in the @xmath33-direction , gives the transverse response as @xcite:@xmath34and the longitudinal component @xmath35 with a logarithmic singularity at @xmath36 .",
    "non - isotropy here is a consequence of the assumption of a nel ground state with long - range order .",
    "now the true quantum ground state does not have long - range order , which means isotropy must apply .",
    "the inadequacy of ( swt dsf ) triggered further efforts .",
    "first those of muller - thomas - beck - bonner , where , guided by exact results of the one - dimensional xy model , numerical calculations on finite chains and known sum rules , it is constructed an ansatz for the dsf of the spin @xmath37 chain at zero temperature , the so - called mller ansatz:@xmath38where @xmath39 is the heaviside step function .",
    "this form for the dsf has two main features .",
    "( i ) a square - root singularity at the lower boundary of the spin - wave continuum .",
    "( ii ) a built - in strict restriction to the spin - wave continuum itself , which is not physical at the high - frequency end if the mller ansatz is to represent the total dsf .",
    "indeed , the mller ansatz predicts an abrupt high - energy cutoff while computer calculations @xcite suggest there is contribution of states outside the continuum , particularly from above , but with a scattering weight two orders of magnitude lower than that of neighboring states inside the continuum . within the spinon picture ,",
    "the small contributions outside the continuum are identified with processes in which more than two spinons are created .",
    "there is also a relatively small but systematic underestimation of the relative spectral weight near @xmath40 nagler - tennant - cowley - perring - satija .",
    "but in overall , the mller ansatz gives reasonable results ( to order unity ) for known sum rules , is consistent with quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite and supported by @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it is in good agreement with the inelastic neutron scattering experiments done on kcuf@xmath3 nagler - tennant - cowley - perring - satija , tennant - perring - cowley - nagler , tennant - cowley - nagler - tsvelik .",
    "the second set of efforts was to map the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in the long wavelength limit onto a relativistic quantum field theory and exploit the bosonization method of luther and peschel @xcite to obtain an analytic expression of the dsf at finite temperature schulz .",
    "for integer spins , one finds that the dsf has a single mode with a gap as predicted in @xcite . for half - integer spins ,",
    "the expression of the dsf at zero temperature agrees with the low - momentum limit of the mller ansatz and  at finite temperature , there is good agreement with the measurements on kcuf@xmath3 tennant - perring - cowley - nagler , tennant - cowley - nagler - tsvelik .",
    "but all the above results regarding the dynamic structure function , though useful in their own right , are only approximate .",
    "this is important to note because over the decades , a number of quantum spin chains , most notably the heisenberg model , have been amenable to exact solutions . as to the methods used , first there was the bethe ansatz @xcite which , as already mentioned , gives the exact ground state for the model with characteristics different from the classical nel antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "then techniques were developed in successful attempts to calculate exactly a number of thermodynamic quantities , techniques like the method of ( commuting ) transfer matrices and the yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "these methods culminated in the so - called quantum inverse scattering method @xcite , a milestone towards the recognition of the quantum group symmetry present in the model .",
    "but up to here , all the exact results were for the most part concerned with only the static ( thermodynamic ) properties of the quantum spin chains ; correlation functions that encode the dynamics remained elusive to exact treatment .",
    "one had to wait for advances in two - dimensional conformal field theory to see how the infinite two - dimensional conformal symmetry allows the computation of correlation functions of the so - called vertex operators , using bosonization techniques @xcite .",
    "the same strategy was then applied to quantum spin chains once it became clear how to adapt the bosonization method to deformed commutation relations between creation and annihilation operators frenkel - jing , davies - foda - jimbo - miwa - nakayashiki , abada - bougourzi - gradechi , bougourzi1 . for the heisenberg model ,",
    "actual formal manipulations are made in the context of the equivalent six - vertex model where vertex operators are defined in the framework of the infinite - dimensional representation of the quantum group .",
    "correlation functions are then defined and , when mapped back to local spin operators , compact expressions of form factors are obtained @xcite .",
    "the above treatment , though technically involved , opened the way for a systematic exact treatment of the dynamic structure factor . in an expansion in the ( even ) number of spinons @xcite , it was first obtained an exact expression for the two - spinon contribution @xmath2 @xcite , and a comparison with the mller ansatz showed that it gives a better account of the phenomenology @xcite .",
    "next an exact expression of the four - spinon contribution @xmath0 to the dsf was derived in @xcite and its behavior as a function of the neutron energy and momentum transfers @xmath11 and @xmath6 respectively was studied in @xcite .",
    "the present work aims at furthering the investigation of the properties of the four - spinon dsf @xmath0 . through an estimation of a number of sum rules",
    ", we address the issue of  the spectral weight within @xmath0 in the total @xmath1 .",
    "the sum rules we use are : the static susceptibility , the integrated intensity , the total integrated intensity , the first frequency moment and the nearest - neighbor correlation function .",
    "we reach the conclusion that @xmath41 contributes a weight between 1% and 2.5% , depending on the sum rule used , whereas @xmath2 contributes a weight between 70% and 75% .",
    "this is consistent with the finite chain calculations of muller - thomas - beck - bonner where it is observed that states just up the spin - wave continuum contribute with a scattering weight two orders of magnitude smaller than states within the continuum .",
    "the sum rules we investigate involve multi - dimensional integrations and these are performed using monte carlo algorithms .",
    "the statistical errors are reasonable .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we describe briefly in the next section the @xmath13 antiferromagnetic heisenberg quantum spin chain in the framework of @xcite , give the definition of the dynamic structure factor @xmath1 and decompose it into @xmath42-spinon contributions @xmath43 with @xmath42 even .",
    "then we write the expressions of @xmath2 and @xmath0 and give a brief account of their respective features and behaviors . in section three",
    "we describe the five sum rules we use to estimate the scattering weight of the four - spinon contribution and the results obtained . as already mentioned , the calculations use monte carlo integration methods and a discussion of the errors is given .",
    "section four includes concluding remarks and indicates few directions in which one can carry forward .",
    "the antiferromagnetic @xmath13 xxx heisenberg chain is defined as the isotropic limit of the xxz anisotropic heisenberg model with the following hamiltonian : @xmath44@xmath45 is the anisotropy parameter and the isotropic antiferromagnetic limit is obtained as @xmath46 , or equivalently @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 are the usual pauli matrices acting at the site @xmath42 of the chain .",
    "note that the definition ( [ hamiltonian ] ) and its isotropic limit are totally equivalent to the usual one if we consider @xcite the transformation @xmath49 , which transforms the hamiltonian @xmath50 into @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 . as mentioned already in the introductory section ,",
    "we take the coupling constant @xmath53 as well as @xmath54 and the external magnetic field @xmath55 .",
    "lattice spacing is also taken equal to one .",
    "all this is consistent with the notation and conventions used in @xcite which we follow closely .",
    "the full exploitation of the quantum affine algebra @xmath56 symmetry of the model requires an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian directly in the thermodynamic limit . because of two different boundary conditions on the infinite chain , there are two equivalent vacuum states @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",

    "the ones we consider in this work are : the static susceptibility , the integrated intensity , the total integrated intensity , the first frequency moment and the nearest - neighbor correlation function . in the sequel , for each of these five sum rules , we calculate the corresponding contribution from the two - spinon dsf @xmath2 and then the corresponding contribution from the four - spinon dsf @xmath0",

    "are displayed .",
    "finally , note that all the exact results we refer to are known in the literature hohenberg - brinkman , muller .",
    "the first sum rule we consider is the one giving the _ static susceptibility _ @xmath130 for two local spin operators .",
    "it is related to the dynamic structure factor via the relation @xcite:@xmath131the static susceptibility is known exactly in the limit @xmath132 .",
    "it is found to be : @xmath133we therefore calculate the static susceptibility for both @xmath2 and @xmath0 using ( [ chi - k ] ) for small values of @xmath6 , which we denote @xmath134 and @xmath135 respectively .",
    "our results are displayed in table 1 .",
    "of course , @xmath136 and @xmath135 for the chosen values of small @xmath6 will not compare directly to @xmath137 . note also that it is not possible to take @xmath6 directly equal to zero before integration because we would get zero identically . finally , the behaviors of @xmath134 and @xmath135 themselves  as functions of small @xmath6 are not of interest in this study .",
    "one notes that the @xmath128 factor stays around one but @xmath138 is relatively high with respect to the coming sum rules , around 13% on average .",
    "this can easily be traced to the sensitivity of the integration to the low - energy region as there is the factor @xmath139 .",
    "indeed , better precision is obtained when @xmath73 appears in the numerator and not in the denominator .",
    "for this sum rule , @xmath140 is only compared to @xmath141 and on average , the ratio @xmath142 is around 0.6% .",

    "the next sum rule we consider is the one that defines the _ integrated intensity _ with respect to the neutron energy transfer , namely : @xmath143the behavior of the integrated intensity is not exactly known for all values of @xmath6 , but for small @xmath6 , we know it is linear : @xmath144we will then use ( [ integrated intensity of k ] ) to calculate , for small @xmath145 , the integrated intensity @xmath146 coming the two - spinon dsf @xmath2 and the integrated intensity @xmath147 coming from the four - spinon dsf @xmath0 . the results are displayed in table 2 and plotted in fig 1 .",
    "we notice a clear linear behavior for @xmath146 , with a slope roughly 75% of that of @xmath148 .",
    "the four - spinon integrated intensity presents a somewhat linear behavior too , with a slope roughly 1% of that of @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath128 factor is still of order one and the standard deviation @xmath149 is here too about 13% , as for the static susceptibility .",
    "the explanation lies also in the small @xmath73-region .      the _ total integrated intensity _ with respect to both energy and momentum is defined by : @xmath150it is known to be exactly equal to @xcite : @xmath151table 3 displays our results for this sum rule .",
    "we note a better standard deviation : a relative value of 8% only , compared to the previous 13% .",
    "the @xmath152 factor is of order one .",
    "the two - spinon contribution stays at around 74% whereas the four - spinon contribution is now at about 2.5% .",
    "this trend , namely a better precision and a 2.% contribution , is going to continue in the remaining sum rules .",
    "the next sum rule we look at is related to the _ first frequency moment _ , defined by : @xmath153it is also known exactly , but for all @xmath6 this time .",
    "it reads : @xmath154we have carried out the runs for small values of the momentum transfer and our results for the two - spinon contribution @xmath155 and the four - spinon contribution @xmath156 are displayed in table 4 below .",
    "they are also plotted in fig 2 .    on sees that @xmath155 has the right quadratic behavior from ( [ exact k(k ) ] ) with a relative coefficient of roughly 69% .",
    "but what is remarkable is the fact that also @xmath156 has the same quadratic behavior , with a stable coefficient of about 2.5% .",
    "the @xmath128 factor is of order one and the standard deviation is better , around 6.7% .",
    "the better statistics comes partly from the fact that the neutron energy @xmath11 is present in the numerator and not in the denominator in the integral ( [ first - frequency - moment ] ) , which makes the numerical integration more stable close to @xmath157 .",
    "one may then expect the higher frequency moments @xmath158 with @xmath159 to give even more stable results .",
    "the last sum rule we consider is related to the _ nearest - neighbor correlation function _ defined by the following relations : @xmath160its value is also known exactly @xcite : @xmath161where @xmath162 is the ground - state energy per site which , in the thermodynamic limit , is given by : @xmath163our results for the nearest - neighbor correlation function are displayed in table 5 below .",
    "the two - spinon contribution is about 72%  and the four - spinon contribution is around 2.4% .",
    "the ( relative ) standard deviation @xmath129 is about 12% and the @xmath128 factor is of order one .",
    "in this work , we have calculated five sum rules for the exact four - spinon dynamic structure factor @xmath0 in the spin 1/2 heisenberg antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain .",
    "the calculations were all numerical using monte carlo integration methods .",
    "the statistics is satisfactory : the @xmath152 factor is always around one and the standard deviation @xmath164 range between 7% and 13% of the calculated quantity .",
    "it is better for sum rules in which the neutron momentum transfer @xmath73 appears in the numerator since this make the integration more stable when close to zero .    from this analysis ,",
    "we conclude that the four - spinon dsf @xmath0 contributes to the total dynamic structure factor @xmath1 a factor between 1% and 2.5% , depending on the sum rule used , whereas the two - spinon contribution is between 70% and 75% .",
    "these results are consistent with the expectation from finite chain calculations @xcite that the spectral weight of states outside the two - spinon continuum is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the spectral weight of neighboring states within the continuum .    there are five directions in which one may wish to carry forward .",
    "the first direction is to try to determine an expression for the six - spinon contribution @xmath165 , study its behavior as a function of @xmath73 and @xmath6 and then determine its contribution to the total @xmath166 but one should know that , technically , matters may be more involved .    the second direction to explore is the study of the dynamic structure factor in the anisotropic case .",
    "this is also of physical interest since perfect isotropy is only an ideal limit .",
    "the model is exactly solvable and we do have generic expressions for @xmath79 in the form of contour integrals in the spectral parameters complex planes @xcite .",
    "the difficulty here is that the integrands involve much more complicated functions which are already present in @xmath2 , and one should expect intricate complexities in this more general case .",
    "the third direction to explore is to include a ( small ) external magnetic field .",
    "there are finite - chain calculations in this regard , muller - thomas - beck - bonner and more recently @xcite .",
    "but one has to remember that the model in not exactly solvable in this case .",
    "one will then have to try small perturbations around the zero - field limit solution .",
    "the fourth direction is the finite - temperature case . here",
    "too there are finite - chain @xcite and field - theory results schulz .",
    "it is then certainly interesting to see the temperature effects on @xmath2 and perhaps on @xmath0 .",
    "the fifth direction is to look into the situation of a spin - one chain .",
    "the model is still exactly solvable and , exploiting the quantum group symmetry , compact expressions for the form factors are available idzumi , bougourzi - weston , bougourzi - any - spin .",
    "one key issue in this regard is to try to recover the haldane gap @xcite through these exact manipulations ."
