    "in clinical trials for drugs or medical devices , statistical significance is widely used to infer the treatment effect .",
    "however , there has been growing recognition that statistical significance could be misleading when evaluating treatment effect ( jacobson et al . , 1984 ;",
    "jacobson and truax , 1991 ) .",
    "first , in many trials , the statistical significance of the treatment effect may have little to do with its clinical significance .",
    "it is known that statistical significance only infers the existence of treatment effect , regardless of the effect size .",
    "further , the statistical significance could result from a small sample variability or a huge sample size , and thus provides little information about the clinical meaningfulness of the treatment ( jacobson and truax , 1991 ) .",
    "second , the statistical significance for the treatment group compared to the placebo group ignores the possible heterogeneity among individuals .",
    "for instance , in a pain reduction study , a statistically significant reduction is concluded for a test treatment while many individual patients in the treatment group actually report little improvement regarding the pain reduction ( younger et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "clinical significance is desired in practice as it provides a better assessment of the clinically meaningful improvement .",
    "it is often based on the patients reports in a community according to certain external standards ( jacobson and truax , 1991 ) .",
    "one common approach is to collect patient - reported outcomes ( pro s ; fda , 2009 ) , such as their satisfaction of a treatment .",
    "some earlier practice suggested to replace the statistical significance tests by analyzing the pro s only , which is problematic due to the subjective bias in the pro s or unreliability of a poorly designed questionnaire .",
    "minimum clinically important difference ( mcid ) was discussed in jaeschke et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , which was intuitively defined as a thresholding value in post - treatment change , and a patient is considered experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement if her / his change exceeds the mcid .",
    "copay et al .",
    "( 2007 ) suggested to incorporate both certainty of effective treatment and patients satisfactions for determining mcid .",
    "the concept of mcid provides objective reference for clinicians and health policy makers regarding the effectiveness of the treatment , and has quickly gained its popularity among the practitioners . in 2012 , u.s .",
    "food and drug administration ( fda ) hosted a special conference on the mcid for orthopaedic devices ( http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/newevents/workshops/conferences/ucm327292.htm ) .",
    "although the importance of mcid has been widely recognized , only a few ad - hoc approaches have been proposed for its estimation with little theoretical justification ( bennett , 1985 ; leisenring and alonzo , 2000 ; shiu and gatsonis , 2008 ) .    in this paper ,",
    "the mcid is formulated as the thresholding value in post - treatment change such that the probability of disagreement between the estimated satisfaction based on the mcid and the pro is minimized . with this framework ,",
    "two scenarios are considered : population - based mcid and personalized mcid .",
    "the population - based mcid is the ideal thresholding value for the general population , and the personalized mcid allows different mcid values for individual patients based on their clinical profiles .",
    "both scenarios can be formulated in a large margin classification framework , where the population - based mcid can be estimated via an exhaustive grid search , and the personalized mcid is modeled in a reproducing kernel hilbert space and estimated via some non - convex optimization techniques .",
    "most importantly , the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimation method are established for both population - based and personalized mcid s , and their fast convergence rates to the ideal performance are explicitly quantified .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "a general framework for the population - based mcid is presented , and its estimation algorithm and asymptotic properties are studied .",
    "section 3 extends the framework to the personalized mcid , and discusses the appropriate large margin loss as well as the efficient non - convex optimization technique .",
    "section 4 establishes the asymptotic properties of our proposed method for estimating the personalized mcid .",
    "section 5 conducts numerical experiments of our proposed method in simulated examples , and section 6 applies our proposed method to two phase-3 clinical trial datasets . section 7 contains some discussion , and the appendix is devoted to technical proofs .",
    "suppose that a patient s diagnostic measurement @xmath0 is continuously connected , and the patient - reported outcome ( pro ) @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes a clinically meaningful treatment reported by the patient and @xmath3 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be the joint density of @xmath6 and the marginal density of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the mcid is formulated as the thresholding value @xmath8 such that @xmath9 agrees with @xmath10 as much as possible , where @xmath11 if @xmath12 and @xmath13 otherwise .",
    "mathematically , @xmath8 is defined as a solution of @xmath14 where @xmath15 is taken with respect to both @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "assume that @xmath16 is continuous and increasing in @xmath17 , then the ideal mcid @xmath8 satisfies @xmath18 furthermore , if @xmath19 is strictly increasing in @xmath17 , then @xmath8 is the unique root of ( [ eqn : cmt_sol ] ) .",
    "note that it is reasonable to assume that @xmath19 is increasing in @xmath17 since patients with better diagnostic measurements are expected to be more likely to give positive responses",
    ". if @xmath19 is only non - decreasing , the equation in ( [ eqn : cmt_sol ] ) may have multiple roots and a conservative choice is to set @xmath8 as the largest root .",
    "furthermore , the continuity assumption of @xmath19 can be relaxed to semi - continuity , and then the equation in ( [ eqn : cmt_sol ] ) may have no root at all . in such scenarios ,",
    "it could be proved similarly as lemma 1 that @xmath20 .",
    "it is known that the quality of the pro s is largely affected by patients subjectivity ( frost et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "such subjectivity is accounted in the proposed formulation of the mcid through @xmath19 , which can be interpreted as the probability of patient s telling the truth .",
    "for instance , fang ( 2011 ) considered a special case of semi - continuous @xmath19 , and modeled the subjectivity explicitly as @xmath21 when @xmath22 and @xmath23 otherwise , where @xmath24 measures how trustworthy the pro s are .",
    "more importantly , the ideal mcid in ( [ eqn : cmt_sol ] ) is less affected by the subjectivity in the pro s , as it relies on @xmath19 only when @xmath17 is in the neighborhood of @xmath8 .",
    "this is analogous to the bayes rule in classification , which only relies on whether @xmath25 ( lin , 2002 ) .",
    "in addition , the mcid has an interesting connection with the median lethal dose in toxicology research .",
    "the median lethal dose refers to the smallest dose required to kill half of the animals that receive it after a specified test duration . to describe the interaction between dosage and mortality rate ,",
    "the logistic dose - response curve is popularly used ( williams , 1986 ; alho and valtonen , 1995 ; kelly , 2001 ) .",
    "it assumes that the mortality rate is expected to strictly increase with dose , which coincides with our assumption in lemma 1 .",
    "the primary interest of this paper is to estimate the mcid , which is in sharp contrast to the standard classification that focuses on the classification boundary . in ( [ eqn : cmt_sol ] ) , the ideal mcid @xmath8 is defined based on @xmath19 that is often unavailable in practice , so the mcid needs to be estimated based on the training sample @xmath26 .",
    "naturally , the expectation in ( [ eqn : cmt ] ) can be approximated by its empirical version , and the estimated mcid @xmath27 is defined as a solution of @xmath28 note that ( [ eqn : cmt_est ] ) is a simple 1-dimensional optimization problem , and the objective function remains the same for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the @xmath31-th order statistic .",
    "therefore , an exhaustive grid search scheme can be implemented , and the global minimizer @xmath32 is simply the @xmath33 that yields the smallest objective function value .",
    "the estimated mcid @xmath32 in ( [ eqn : cmt_est ] ) is a consistent estimate of @xmath8 if @xmath19 is continuous and strictly increasing in @xmath17 .",
    "further , if there exist positive constants @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , such that for sufficiently small @xmath38 , @xmath39 then @xmath40 .    theorem 1 establishes the asymptotic convergence rate of @xmath41 , and the finite sample bound for @xmath41 can also be obtained as in appendix a. in theorem 1 , ( [ eqn : low_noise ] ) is similar to the low noise assumption ( polonik , 1995 ; bartlett et al . , 2003 ;",
    "tsybakov , 2004 ) that describes the behavior of @xmath7 in the neighborhood of @xmath8 , and ( [ eqn : lipschitz ] ) is implied by a hlder continuity condition on @xmath19 . for illustration , if @xmath7 is uniformly distributed on @xmath42 $ ] and ( [ eqn : lipschitz ] ) is met with @xmath43 , then ( [ eqn : low_noise ] ) can be verified with @xmath44 for sufficiently small @xmath45 .",
    "theorem 1 then implies that @xmath46 .",
    "it leads to a fast convergence rate when @xmath19 has a steep derivative at @xmath8 with @xmath43 close to 0 , and a rate of @xmath47 when ( [ eqn : lipschitz ] ) holds with order @xmath48 .      in many clinical studies ,",
    "it is a common practice to be conservative when predicting whether the test outcome is clinically meaningful .",
    "it is then less desirable to predict positive for an unsatisfied patient than negative for a satisfied patient . to accommodate the unbalanced severity",
    ", the weighted mcid can be introduced with the weights reflecting the severity of the disagreements .",
    "specifically , the weighted mcid @xmath49 is defined as a solution of @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "similarly as in lemma 1 , it can be shown that @xmath53 where an appropriate choice of @xmath54 leads to a conservative estimation .",
    "the weighted mcid has another useful interpretation in the context of hypothesis testing .",
    "in particular , we denote the type - i error and type - ii error as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "then it is natural to find @xmath57 to solve @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the significance level as in the standard hypothesis testing setup .",
    "this formulation is closely related with the neyman - pearson classification as discussed in scott and nowak ( 2005 ) and rigollet and tong ( 2011 ) .",
    "more interestingly , an one - to - one correspondence between the weighted mcid @xmath49 in ( [ eqn : cmt_w_sol ] ) and the solution @xmath60 in ( [ eqn : neyman ] ) can be easily established .",
    "in many clinical trials , it is commonly believed that patients report could be influenced by various factors such as their expectation of treatment ( wise , 2004 ) .",
    "for instance , in a shoulder pain reduction study , healthy people demonstrate a higher threshold than those with chronic conditions due to their expectation of complete recovery . to allow the mcid to vary according to patients clinical profiles , this section extends the estimation framework to personalized mcid .",
    "let @xmath61 denote patients clinical profiles , and the personalized mcid @xmath62 is formulated as a solution of @xmath63 where @xmath64 is taken with respect to @xmath65 .",
    "similarly as in ( [ eqn : cmt_sol ] ) , we can show that @xmath62 satisfies @xmath66 where @xmath67 is assumed to be a continuous and strictly increasing function in @xmath17 for any value of @xmath61 .",
    "if only semi - continuity is assumed , the mcid can be formulated as @xmath68 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the personalized mcid in ( [ eqn : cmt_z ] ) differs from the bayes rule in classification in that the candidate function in ( [ eqn : cmt_z ] ) has to take the form of @xmath69 in order to estimate @xmath62 , whereas a bayes rule in classification searches for the optimal classification function @xmath70 that may not lead to an explicit estimation of @xmath62 .",
    "the formulation in ( [ eqn : cmt_z ] ) is similar as in ( [ eqn : cmt ] ) with population - based @xmath8 , but the difficulty arises in the estimation part . since the empirical version of ( [ eqn : cmt_z ] ) @xmath71 involves the 0 - 1 loss @xmath72 and needs to be optimized with respect to functional @xmath73 , it can no longer be solved by the exhaustive grid search or any other efficient optimization techniques . therefore , a surrogate loss function needs to be introduced to replace the 0 - 1 loss and facilitate the estimation .",
    "the surrogate loss has been widely studied in machine learning literature .",
    "popularly used surrogate loss functions @xmath74 include the hinge loss @xmath75 ( vapnik , 1998 ) , the logistic loss @xmath76 ( zhu and hastie , 2005 ) , and the @xmath77-loss @xmath78 ( shen et al . , 2003 ; liu and shen , 2006 ) .",
    "however , all these losses are not generally fisher consistent in estimating @xmath62 , as the candidate function in ( [ eqn : cmt_z ] ) is restricted to the form of @xmath69 for estimating mcid .",
    "counter examples can be constructed as in appendix b.    in this paper , we propose a novel surrogate loss , @xmath79-loss , which is defined as @xmath80 the @xmath79-loss extends the @xmath77-loss by introducing a new parameter @xmath81 that controls the difference between the surrogate loss and the 0 - 1 loss .",
    "more importantly , lemma 2 shows that the @xmath79-loss is asymptotically fisher consistent in estimating @xmath62 when @xmath81 converges to 0 .    for",
    "any given @xmath61 , if the conditional density @xmath82 is continuous and @xmath83 is strictly increasing in @xmath17 , then @xmath84 converges to @xmath85 as @xmath86 uniformly over a compact set @xmath87 containing @xmath62 and @xmath88    with the @xmath79-loss , the proposed estimation formulation for the personalized mcid @xmath89 solves @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a tuning parameter , @xmath92 is a penalty term , and @xmath93 is set as a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ; wahba , 1990 ) .",
    "the final estimation formulation then becomes @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the rkhs induced by some pre - specified kernel function @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the associated rkhs norm of @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from the representer theorem ( wahba , 1990 ) that the solution to ( [ eqn : rkhs ] ) is of the form @xmath98 , and thus @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "note that the cost function in ( [ eqn : rkhs ] ) is non - convex , and thus we employ the difference convex algorithm ( dca ; an and tao , 1997 ) to tackle the non - convex optimization . the key idea of the dca is to decompose the non - convex cost function into the difference of two convex functions , and then construct a sequence of subproblems by approximating the second convex function with its affine minorization function .",
    "in particular , the @xmath79-loss is decomposed as @xmath102 then the cost function in ( [ eqn : rkhs ] ) can be decomposed as @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 is the coefficient vector for the rkhs representation of @xmath73 .",
    "next , the dca constructs a sequence of decreasing upper envelop of @xmath106 by approximating @xmath107 with its affine minorization function , @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the estimated @xmath105 at the @xmath110-th iteration , and @xmath111 is the subgradient of @xmath107 at @xmath109 .",
    "the updated @xmath112 is then obtained by solving @xmath113 the updating scheme is iterated until convergence .",
    "although the dca can not guarantee global optimum , it delivers a superior numerical performance as demonstrated in the extensive simulation study in liu et al .",
    "this section quantifies the asymptotic behavior of @xmath89 in estimating the personalized mcid .",
    "denote @xmath114 with @xmath115 , where @xmath81 and @xmath91 are rewritten as @xmath116 and @xmath117 to denote their dependency on @xmath118 .",
    "we make the following four technical assumptions .    _ assumption a. _ for some positive sequence @xmath119 as @xmath120 , there exists @xmath121 , such that for sufficiently small @xmath116 , @xmath122 .",
    "that is , @xmath123 .",
    "assumption a is standard ( shen et al . , 2003 ; li et al . , 2007 ) , and",
    "describes the approximation error of @xmath93 in approximating @xmath62 .",

    "assumption c. _ there exist constants @xmath127 and @xmath128 such that for any given @xmath61 , @xmath129 for sufficiently small @xmath45 .",
    "assumption c is implied by a hlder continuity condition that describes the smoothness of @xmath83 around @xmath62 .    before specifying assumption d , we first define the metric entropy for any give set . for a given class @xmath130 of subsets of @xmath131 and any @xmath132 , @xmath133 forms an @xmath134-bracketing set of @xmath130 if for any @xmath135 there is a @xmath136 such that @xmath137 and @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is a distance for any two subsets in @xmath131 defined as @xmath140 and @xmath141",

    "the convergence rate @xmath160 in corollary 1 depends on the value of @xmath116 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath117 .",
