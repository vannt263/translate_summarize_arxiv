    "the comparative half - lives of superallowed fermi @xmath1 decays between @xmath7 isobaric analogue states have been the focus of intense research activity for many years and presently represents one of the most stringent tests of the standard model of the electroweak interaction  @xcite .",
    "the high precision of both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations of their @xmath2 values set stringent limits on scalar and right - handed currents , verify conservation of the vector current to @xmath8 , and determine the up - down element of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark - mixing matrix , @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath2 value of thirteen cases have been measured to @xmath10 ; this places a demanding requirement on theory to attain similar precision .",
    "although these transitions are intrinsically simpler to describe theoretically than most @xmath1 decays because they are relatively insensitive to nuclear - structure effects , small ( @xmath11 ) corrections must be applied to account for the fact that the decay occurs within the nuclear medium . recently , emphasis has been placed on scrutinizing the nuclear - structure - dependent isospin - symmetry - breaking ( isb ) corrections , @xmath12  @xcite , which characterizes the degree to which the fermi matrix element , @xmath13 , deviates from @xmath14 , its value in the limit of strict isospin symmetry : @xmath15 the 13 most precisely - measured cases mentioned previously are all isospin @xmath16 to @xmath16 transitions in @xmath17 nuclei .",
    "shell - model calculations for these cases yield values of order @xmath18 for @xmath19  @xcite and values of order @xmath20 for @xmath21  @xcite . if attention is switched to @xmath22 nuclei , even larger values of @xmath12 are predicted , which if experimentally extracted , would provide an even more demanding test of such isb calculations .",
    "the reason larger values are expected in @xmath22 nuclei is that the daughter analog state sits among many states of lower isospin , @xmath23 .",
    "some of these states have the same spin as the analog state and sizable isospin mixing can occur .    in this work",
    ", we will expand on a recent letter  @xcite which discusses an extraction of the isospin - symmetry breaking correction in the decay of @xmath24 ^32^cl .",
    "its fermi decay branch feeds a @xmath25 state in ^32^s , whose position in the spectrum at 7001-kev excitation  @xcite is very close to a known @xmath26 state at 7190  kev  @xcite .",
    "as discussed below , a calculation of @xmath12 for this case yields @xmath27 , a significantly larger value than those found in @xmath17 nuclei .",

    "a potentially large source of systematic uncertainty arising from the need to detect @xmath0 rays in this measurement may be minimized using the @xmath0 branches of ^32^cl .",
    "this is because @xmath1 decay of ^32^ar is followed by the @xmath1 decay of ^32^cl @xmath32 of the time  @xcite .",
    "thus , ^32^cl provides an _ in situ _",
    "efficiency calibration which is useful to extract isospin - breaking information from ^32^ar .",
    "the present work opens the possibility for significant improvements in the precision with which @xmath12 can be determined in the decay of ^32^ar .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the cyclotron institute , texas a&m university .",
    "a primary beam of ^32^s was produced by an ecr ion source and injected into the k500 superconducting cyclotron to accelerate it to @xmath33 @xmath34  mev / nucleon .",

    "mars was used to spatially separate the reaction products , resulting in a ^32^cl beam with an intensity of @xmath41  ions / s .",
    "beam contamination was identified using a position - sensitive si - strip ( @xmath42 ) detector followed by a silicon ( @xmath43 ) detector which were placed just downstream of the mars focal plane . for data collection",
    ", the si detectors were removed and the beam exited the mars beamline through a @xmath44m - thick kapton window .",
    "the beam then passed through a 0.3  mm thick bc404 scintillator to count the number of ions .",
    "prior to being implanted into a @xmath45m - thick aluminized - mylar tape which is part of a fast tape - transport system , the beam was passed through a set of al degraders .",
    "the thickness of the degraders was chosen to ensure that the activity was deposited mid - way through the tape .",
    "the different ranges of the contaminants compared to ^32^cl allowed further purification ; however , since we were searching for small branches and wanted to maximize the yields , we allowed greater contamination than usual of the deposited activity , accepting 91% as our final purity of ^32^cl .",
    "the ^32^cl atoms were collected in an @xmath46  cm diameter spot on the tape for 0.8  s , after which the beam was interrupted and the tape - transport system was triggered to move the activity to a shielded counting station @xmath47  cm away .",

    "the data were registered event - by - event by recording all @xmath3 coincidences between a 1-mm - thick bc404 plastic scintillator and a 70% hpge detector .",
    "the @xmath49  inch diameter scintillator @xmath42 detector had a threshold of @xmath50  kev and was placed 5  mm behind the tape subtending @xmath51 of the total solid angle for the @xmath1s .",

    "the @xmath0-ray energy , the @xmath42 of the @xmath1 , the coincidence time between them , and the time of the event relative to the beginning of the cycle were all recorded .",
    "the typical tape cycle , outlined in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , was repeated continuously throughout the experiment .",
    "the total number of @xmath1 singles events and the total number of heavy ions ( his ) from mars ( detected by the first scintillator ) for each cycle were determined from scalers and recorded . the ratio of @xmath1 singles to his was used to veto bad cycles where , for example , the tape transport did not place the activity exactly in the correct location . of the @xmath53 cycles made over the course of the experiment , 92.5% survived the @xmath1/hi ratio cut .",

    "our simulations where the geometry contained only detailed descriptions of the detectors and mylar tape ( _ i.e. _  neglecting the table , the floor , the walls , etc . ) underestimates this summing effect . rather than attempting to include the many potentially important scattering surfaces",

    "in addition to reducing the uncertainties in all of the branches / yields by approximately an order of magnitude , we have observed @xmath361 more @xmath0 branches and three new @xmath1 branches compared to dtraz _",

    "the usual statistical rate function , @xmath377 , as used for example in table  [ table : beta - branches ] to obtain @xmath152 values , puts the shape correction function @xmath369 to unity . taking the fermi strength to be zero for these non - analogue transitions , we obtain an experimental value for the gt strength from @xmath378 and an associated experimental gt matrix element , @xmath379 , defined by : @xmath380 because @xmath381 depends on the gt matrix element via @xmath369 , we use an iterative procedure which is explained below . in eq .",

    "finally , we need an evaluation of the nuclear - structure - dependent piece of the radiative correction , @xmath456 . such a term arises because in a many - body system such as a nucleus , the electromagnetic interaction and the weak interaction that collectively induce a radiative correction do not have to interact with the same nucleon in the nucleus .",

    "<S> background : :    models to calculate small isospin - symmetry - breaking effects in    superallowed fermi decays have been placed under scrutiny in recent    years . </S>",
    "<S> a stringent test of these models is to measure transitions for    which the correction is predicted to be large . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of ^32^cl    decay provides such a test case . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    to improve the @xmath0 yields following the    @xmath1 decay of ^32^cl and to determine the    @xmath2 values of the the @xmath1 branches ,    particularly the one to the isobaric - analogue state in ^32^s . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    reaction - produced and recoil - spectrometer - separated ^32^cl is    collected in tape and transported to a counting location where    @xmath3 coincidences are measured with a    precisely - calibrated hpge detector . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the precision on the @xmath0 yields for most of the known    @xmath1 branches has been improved by about an order of    magnitude , and many new transitions have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> we have    determined ^32^cl - decay transition strengths extending up to    @xmath4  mev .  </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 value for the decay    to the isobaric - analogue state in ^32^s has been measured . </S>",
    "<S> a    comparison to a shell - model calculation shows good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    we have experimentally determined the isospin - symmetry - breaking    correction to the superallowed transition of this decay to be    @xmath5 ,    significantly larger than for any other known superallowed fermi    transition . </S>",
    "<S> this correction agrees with a shell - model calculation ,    which yields @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> . our    results also provide a way to improve the measured @xmath2    values for the @xmath1 decay of ^32^ar . </S>"
