    "the visible spectrum of the nucleus of ngc 3516 was first described by @xcite and includes bright , and unusually broad permitted balmer emission lines of hydrogen ( h ) , narrow [ oiii]@xmath64959,5007 , and absent [ oii]@xmath73727 forbidden emission lines .",
    "collectively , these spectroscopic features have become a defining characteristic of seyfert 1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and much effort has been expended since in trying to understand their origin as reviewed recently by @xcite .",
    "ngc 3516 is of potentially great importance in deciphering the mystery surrounding the origin of broad h emission lines because this low luminosity active galactic nucleus ( llagn ) is also time - variable allowing various independent measures of the broad line region ( blr ) size .",
    "for example , correlated variability between the h@xmath1 emission line and the adjacent continuum lead to a balmer reverberation lag @xmath8 7 l.d .",
    "however , complementary observations of correlated time variability between the visible and near infrared continua point to a 2.2@xmath9 ( @xmath10-band ) dust reverberation radius of @xmath8 50 - 70 l.d @xcite .",
    "thus , the dust sublimation radius is about an order of magnitude larger than the balmer reverberation radius .",
    "this size discrepancy is very significant and is evidently a common feature of reverberating agn @xcite begging the question _ what lies in between ? _ a plausible answer to this question is the model proposed by @xcite , in which the central uv  x - ray source is able to sublimate dust from a sizeable volume of h gas , permitting it to be photoionized .",
    "according to this interpretation the balmer reverberation radius marks just the inner radius of a much larger volume of photoionized gas , an insight articulated previously by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in this context",
    "it is of interest to note that seyfert alikened the visible spectrum of ngc 3516 to that of a planetary nebula which bears some geometrical resemblence to the blr photoionization model of @xcite .",

    "hst _ in the context of the @xcite photoionization model .",
    "an important constraint in any such model is the shape and amplitude of the ionizing continuum .",
    "recent observations with @xmath11 allowed @xcite to constrain the ionizing continuum of the agn in ngc 3516 as the combination of emission from an accretion disk and an x - ray power law . that ionizing continuum is adopted here as an input to the photoionization code cloudy @xcite which can predict the relative intensity of the balmer emission lines for various radial density distributions of photoionized gas .",
    "additionally , since the central black hole ( bh ) mass is known @xcite the shape of the broad balmer emission lines can be used to constrain the balmer emission line emissivity given a kinematic description for the gas . when combined with the x - ray luminosity",
    ", the bh mass implies that the agn in ngc 3516 is radiating at @xmath8 0.6% the eddington luminosity limit @xcite and is therefore unable to sustain a radiatively driven outflow .",
    "thus , the blr gas kinematics are most likely dominated by gravity .",
    "time resolved spectra discussed by @xcite indicate that the blr is actually an inflow of h gas .",
    "paradoxically , the agn in ngc 3516 may also be associated with an outflow ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) driven by two jets ,",
    "the orientation and geometry of which has been discussed previously by @xcite , such jets are comprised of a relativistic plasma producing extended radio continuum and collisionally excited forbidden line emission , but little or no balmer emission .",
    "consequently , the broad balmer emission lines most likely originate in h gas that is photoionized by the central uv  x - ray source .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to test that conjecture .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "a review of the uv and visible spectra of ngc 3516 obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) is presented in section 2 .",
    "these observations are combined with a model for the ionizing continuum presented in section 2.2 .",
    "emission line ratios , corrected for dust extinction , constrain a cloudy photoionization model for the blr in ngc 3516 as described in section 3 .",
    "a discussion follows in section 4 and conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "the _ hst_/stis observations , described in more detail in the following , provide fluxes and relative intensities for the h balmer emission lines along with a measure of their line profile shapes .",
    "these observational results provide key constraints in a photoionization model for the blr in ngc 3516 that is presented in section 3 .",
    "ngc 3516 has been visited twice with stis .",
    "first in 1998 when it was observed intensively for a period of two days using the g430l and g140l gratings , then a second short visit just over two years later , in 2000 , when it was observed again with the g430l grating and also the g750 m grating .",
    "the stis observations for both visits are summarized in table 1 , and the visible spectra are presented in figure 1 .",
    "some details of those observations have been reported previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a thorough analysis of the uv emission line spectrum of ngc 3516 has been presented previously by @xcite .",
    "emission line changed less than the flux in the wings .",
    "the inset shows an expanded region around the h@xmath1 emission line.,width=279 ]    multiple calibrated exposures obtained through each of the g750 m and g430l gratings were shifted and combined for each grating but separately for each visit using the stsdas task occreject .",
    "subsequently , emission line fluxes were measured using the stsdas contributed task specfit . between the years 1998 , and 2000 the visible continuum measured with the g430l grating decreased quite conspicuously by @xmath8 20% as illustrated in figure 2 . the decrease in continuum brightness",
    "may be caused in part by the smaller slit size employed for the year 2000 observation .",
    "however , ngc 3516 is also known to be reverberating @xcite and the @xmath8 5% decrease in the h@xmath1 emission line flux between the two observations is consistent with prior observations . intriguingly , the flux in the core of the h@xmath1 emission line changed less than the flux in the wings , as the inset to figure 2 shows in more detail .    the balmer series of h , and the [ oiii]@xmath64959,5007 forbidden emission lines dominate the visible emission line spectrum .",

    "was constructed that , when removed , did not oversubtract the broad h@xmath0 emission line profile which is otherwise smoothly varying .",
    "although it can not be seen , the fainter vacuum wavelength 6549.85  [ nii ] emission line is constrained by atomic physics to have the same width and one third the flux of the brighter line .",
    "line fluxes are reported in table 2 for all the emission lines seen in the g750 m spectrum including the broad h@xmath0 emission line , the [ nii ] forbidden emission lines , the density sensitive [ sii ] vacuum wavelength 6718.29  , and 6732.67  lines , plus the two [ oi ] vacuum wavelength 6302.04  , and 6365.53  lines .",

    "the fact that the balmer emission line profiles are so similar suggests that the dust extinction in the visible part of the spectrum , internal to the blr , is essentially zero .    using the results provided in table 2 , observed ratios involving the fluxes for the three brightest balmer lines ; h@xmath0/h@xmath1 , and h@xmath1/h@xmath13 , are reported in table 3 along with the canonical case b values expected for an idealized nebula of uniform electron temperature , corresponding to 10@xmath23 k , and a uniform electron density of 10@xmath23 @xmath5 @xcite .",

    "the amplitude of that continuum model , recapitulated in figure 4 , is constrained by a single xmm - om observation obtained at the end of the year 2001 . however , the model continuum agrees with that measured in the g430l spectrum and the mean extinction corrected 1365@xmath24 continuum discussed previously by @xcite .",

    "these results , depicted in figure 5 , represent the model parameters listed in table 4 .",
    "some interesting trends are apparent .",
    "first , the upper panel in figure 5 shows that the h ionization fraction is predicted to be 100% inside the dust reverberation radius measured by @xcite . plus",
    ", a significant ionization gradient is predicted , in the sense that o@xmath35 is inevitably ionized to o@xmath36 , as the central uv - x - ray source is approached .",
    "consequently , the h and o emitting regions are spatially disparate , the h emission being produced in a dust - free shell , surrounded by a potentially dusty o emitting region .",
    "second , the lower panel of figure 5 shows that inside a radius of @xmath8 0.1 pc , the electron density exceeds the critical density of 7 @xmath3 10@xmath37 @xmath38 for collisional de - excitation of the @xmath39 level of o@xmath35 .",
    "third , the lower panel in figure 5 shows a rapid increase in electron temperature inside the region where h is fully ionized .",
    "cloudy predicts that the electron temperature exceeds 10@xmath4 k at the balmer reverberation radius .",
    "such a rapid rise in temperature correlates with an equally rapid decline in the h@xmath0 emission line emissivity .",
    "this phenomenon leads to a central void , visualized in figure 6 , inside of which there is no balmer line emission .",
    "the perimeter of this central void coincides with the balmer reverberation radius .",
    "thus , the balmer reverberation radius appears to be just the inner radius of a larger volume of ionized gas that is producing balmer line emission .",
    "the reverberating gas , identified with the inner ring of points in figure 6 , represents 15% of the total , based on the same percentage of the total balmer emission line flux that is observed to be time variable , according to the _",
    "statistic @xcite .",
    "although labelled variously , that statistic is routinely used to quantify variability amplitude by providing a measure of the fractional excess variance in the emission line flux ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 3516 is the third llagn following ngc 3227 @xcite and ngc 4051 @xcite for which the inner radius of the volume emitting the balmer emission lines coincides with the balmer reverberation lag .",
    "various measures of blr size in ngc 3516 are provided in the next section .",
    "emission line emissivity inside the dust reverberation radius measured by @xcite .",
    "the number density of darker red dots is proportional to the h@xmath0 emission line emissivity .",
    "the inner lighter pink dots represent 15% of the total that are reverberating @xcite .",
    "the central void identifies the region occupied by the @xmath8 10@xmath4 k x - ray emitting plasma.,width=317 ]      knowing both the h@xmath0 emission line emissivity , and the central bh mass allows one to construct a model h@xmath0 emission line profile , an example of which is illustrated in figure 7 .",
    "the line profile fitting method for estimating the size of the region producing broad balmer line emission has been described previously @xcite . briefly , the method employs a monte carlo simulation of a spherically symmetric distribution of @xmath8 10@xmath41 particles of light , the radial distribution of which is described by the h@xmath0 emission line emissivity predicted by cloudy ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "time resolved spectra discussed by @xcite indicate an infall component to the blr in ngc 3516 .",
    "however , since the time variable component of the h@xmath1 emission line represents only about @xmath8 15% of the total line flux , it is difficult to judge whether this observation is representative of the kinematic state of blr as a whole",
    ". nevertheless , for the purposes of computing the model line profile , every particle is assumed to be moving under the influence of gravity , and in free  fall according to the familiar equation v(r ) = @xmath42 , where v is velocity , g is the gravitational constant , m@xmath43 is the bh mass , and r is the distance of each point from the central supermassive bh .",
    "such spherically symmetric free - fall models produce single peak broad balmer emission line profile shapes .",
    "discrete particle models also have the advantage that they reproduce the small - scale structure seen in broad emission line profiles , which is caused by random clumping in radial velocity space , as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "the central mass determines the relationship between velocity and radius for each point of light and the emissivity determines the number of points at each radius . in the context of the inflow model",
    "there are two free parameters available to model the line shape and they are the inner and outer radius of the emitting volume .",
    "the inner radius defines the full velocity width at zero intensity of the model broad emission line , and the outer radius defines the maximum intensity of the model broad emission line at zero velocity .",
    "thus , comparing a normalized version of the observed broad emission line with the model one effectively constrains the inner and outer radii of the emitting volume using chi - squared minimization . for a bh mass of 31.7@xmath44 @xmath3",
    "10@xmath45 m@xmath46 @xcite one finds that the inner radius , r@xmath47 , of the region emitting the balmer emission lines is 4 @xmath48 l.d . which , within the uncertainties , is comparable to the balmer reverberation lag , @xmath49 = 7 @xmath50 l.d .",
    ", measuredby @xcite .",
    "whereas the outer radius , r@xmath51 , of the region emitting the balmer emission lines is 47 @xmath52 l.d . which coincides with the smallest of the dust reverberation radii measured by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 emissivity predicted by cloudy does a reasonably good job at reproducing the overall shape of the observed h@xmath0 emission line as illustrated in figure 7 , although there are some differences in detail . by design",
    "the model h@xmath0 emission line is symmetric about zero velocity , whereas the observed profile is obviously not .",
    "additionally , the model does not explain the high velocity wings seen in the stis spectra , suggesting a less precipitous decrease in the h@xmath0 emissivity at small radii than predicted by cloudy . nevertheless , the success of the cloudy model is that the h@xmath0 emitting region , defined above , can explain both the h@xmath0 emission line profile shape ( see figure 7 ) and the balmer emission line ratios ( see table 3 ) but it underestimates the extinction corrected h@xmath1 luminosity by @xmath8 60% .",
    "since the balmer emission line emissivity is spatially extended ( see figure 5 ) the model emission line luminosity can be increased to the observed value by increasing the outer radius to a _",
    "luminosity _ radius of 112 l.d . ,",
    "although that change causes the model balmer emission line profile shape to deviate more from the observed one , and the model balmer emission line ratios to no longer agree with the extinction corrected values listed in table 4 . in summary , there are several measures of blr size and they include the balmer reverberation radius , the dust reverberation radius , the inner and outer radius of the volume required to explain the shape and relative intensities of the balmer emission lines , and lastly , the balmer luminosity radius . these various size estimates are illustrated in figure 5",
    "collectively the stis observations constrain a cloudy model for the blr in ngc 3516 that consists of @xmath8 500 m@xmath46 of dust - free h gas that is free - falling towards the central bh at a steady - state rate of @xmath8 1 m@xmath46/yr . even assuming radiatively inefficient accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bolometric luminosity measured for this llagn @xcite indicates that no more than 2% of the inflowing material reaches the event horizon of the bh @xcite raising the question _ where does the majority of the inflowing mass go ? _ evidently , the inflow is diverted into an outflow . the mass outflow rate estimated for ngc 3516 by @xcite accounts for only about 5% of the inflowing mass quoted above .",
    "however , this discrepancy could be easily reconciled if the gas density in the outflow were about a factor of 20 higher than @xcite assumed .",
    "then mass would be conserved since the outflow rate would be similar to the inflow rate .",
    "a mechanism that would allow such an efficient redirection of matter most likely involves a magnetohydrodynamic process since thermal energy and bh spin appear to be insufficient ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", width=317 ]      cloudy predicts that inside the balmer reverberation radius the h gas is an 10@xmath4 k plasma producing no h lines at all because the primary source of opacity is electron scattering .",
    "this inner sanctum is where the x - ray emission originates .",
    "thus , according to this model , the x - ray , and balmer emission are mutually exclusive , which would naturally explain the discordance between the time variability of these two types of radiation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , according to this picture , the x - rays would have to pass through the ionized h to reach the observer which could explain the x - ray absorption features at @xmath8 1 kev described by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the properties of the _ warm absorber _ constrained by @xcite ; a thin shell with an electron density @xmath53 2.4 @xmath3 10@xmath54 @xmath5 , an electron temperature @xmath8 3.5 @xmath3 10@xmath23 k , and a radius @xmath2 0.2 pc , almost perfectly describe the physical properties of the blr gas illustrated in figure 5 . the obvious implication being that the blr @xmath55 the x - ray warm absorber .",
    "subsequently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have identified several _",
    "warm absorbers _ covering a range of ionization parameter , _",
    "u(r ) _ , similar to the range predicted by cloudy , as illustrated in figure 5 .",
    "however , @xcite advocate _",
    "u(r ) _ increasing with radius which is completely opposite to the dependence predicted by cloudy ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "furthermore , integrating the neutral h column of the cloudy model over the entire range of radii depicted in figure 5 leads to a h column density @xmath8 2 @xmath310@xmath56 atoms/@xmath57 , which is an order of magnitude larger than estimated for any of the _ warm absorbers _ described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , it is difficult to associate any of the absorbers identified by @xcite with the blr gas .",
    "what is visually striking about the spectra obtained with stis of ngc 3516 is how faint the forbidden emission lines are compared to the h balmer emission lines .",
    "for example , the observed [ oiii]/h@xmath1 , [ oi]/h@xmath0 , [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 emission line ratios are so small that they render ngc 3516 unclassifiable according to the diagnostic diagrams of @xcite . however , when one compares the observed emission line ratios to the intrinsic ones predicted by the photoionization code cloudy , none of the forbidden lines cited above are expected to be very bright except [ oiii ] .",
    "cloudy predicts the forbidden [ oiii ] emission lines to be about one order of magnitude brighter than observed , even though the model electron density exceeds the critical density for collisional de - excitation of the @xmath39 level of o@xmath35 as mentioned previously in section 3.2 .",
    "thus , if the cloudy calculation is to be believed , then something is diminishing the brightness of the [ oiii ] emission lines seen in ngc 3516 .    looking at figure 5 , one possibility is dust obscuration .",
    "according to the results presented in the upper panel of figure 5 , dust could selectively obscure emission lines produced by any of the first four ionization stages of o. furthermore , although not shown in the figure , the ionization gradient for o is similar to that of other ions including c , n , and s , because all these elements have similar ionization potentials .",
    "thus , forbidden lines from those elements may also be obscured . given that the dust extinction is virtually negligible to the h located inside the dust reverberation radius , any dust would have to be distributed in a face - on ring , or annulus , in order to selectively affect just the forbidden lines .",
    "such a geometry envisaged for the dust is reminiscent of a torus which is the basis for a unified model of agn ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "ideally , one would like to use cloudy to model the impact of dust on the forbidden line emission .",
    "unfortunately , cloudy has a serious limitation in that it has not reliably predicted _ emergent emission line intensities _ for all versions of the code including , and predating v13.02 . although not widely publicized , an admission to this effect is documented on the cloudy simulations wiki hosted by yahoo groupsin a series of e - mail exchangesat the end of the year 2014 .",
    "according to the cloudy documentation , the emergent line intensities include the radiative transfer effects involving dust beyond the region where the various emission lines are formed .",
    "thus , the bug is related to the inclusion of dust in the cloudy models .",
    "regretably dust is included in all models by default unless the user specifies _ no grains _ to disable it .",
    "a recent comparison of photoionization codes @xcite did not address the inclusion of dust which is perhaps why this problem has gone unnoticed for so long .",
    "the other half of the standard output generated by cloudy titled _ intrinsic line intensities _ is apparently unaffected by the bug , and it is those results that are used in this paper . however , according to the cloudy documentation , the intrinsic line intensities do not include the radiative transfer effects involving dust beyond the region where the various emission lines are formed .",
    "consequently the intrinsic line intensities are inappropriate for interpreting observed emission line spectra , unless the dust extinction to each region emitting each emission line is known a priori , and corrected for .",
    "of special concern in this regard are several oft cited , and consequently influential papers dealing with spectroscopy of agn that do not employ a dust extinction correction beyond the galactic value .",
    "collectively , several hundred papers utilizing cloudy have been published in the professional literature . however , since it is not customary among the authors of those papers to declare which output they have been using , be it _ intrinsic _ or , _ emergent _ , or whether or not the _ no grains _ command was implemented , the reliability of any of the results presented is difficult to judge .",
    "this all underscores the pitfall associated with a discipline that relies almost entirely on a single photoionization code , in this case cloudy .",
    "having said all this , cloudy intrinsic line intensities @xmath58 be useful for interpreting the visible balmer emission line spectrum of ngc 3516 , because for this particular agn , it has been demonstrated in sections 2.1 and 2.2 , that the visible dust extinction is virtually negligible to the h in the blr .",
    "if dust is not responsible for the weak forbidden [ oiii ] emission lines observed for ngc 3516 , then the only alternative is low metallicity .",
    "a metallicity that is a factor of 10 lower than the ism value causes cloudy to reproduce the observed [ oiii]/h@xmath1 ratio shown in table 3 .",
    "metal poor gas suggests an origin in the circumgalactic medium .",
    "perhaps the inflow , that we perceive as the blr in ngc 3516 , is just the terminus of a much larger inflow that originates from outside the galaxy .",
    "such inflows of metal poor gas appear to be commonplace , observed in our own galaxy and others @xcite , but this is perhaps the first suggestion of an association between the blr of an agn , and a low metallicity accretion flow from the circumgalactic medium .",
    "such inflows could also explain the low duty cycle observed for agn activity in the local universe .",
    "the main feature of the model presented here to explain the _ visible _ emission line spectrum of ngc 3516 is photoionization of _ low _ density gas @xmath19 10@xmath59 @xmath38 which leads to a spatially extended nebula surrounding the central uv  x - ray source .",
    "in contrast , @xcite use cloudy to explain the uv spectrum of ngc 3516 , in terms of photoionization of an ensemble of optically thick _ broad line clouds _ with _ high _ density , 10@xmath60 @xmath38 @xmath19 n@xmath61 @xmath19 10@xmath62 @xmath38 .",
    "these two models are mutually exclusive .",
    "the differences could be reconciled if there are two photoionization mechanisms at work , one in the visible , and one in the uv . in effect",
    ", a uv  visible dichotomy whereby the uv emission lines are produced by the accretion disk , and the visible emission lines from the photoionized nebula surrounding it . as noted previously in section 2.1 the largest variance in the visible balmer emission line flux occurs in the line wings .",
    "however , the converse is true for the ly@xmath0 emission line where the largest variance occurs in the line core @xcite .",
    "this distinction , if confirmed , would establish a basis for further investigation .",
    "cloudy predicts the photoionized nebula will produce ly@xmath0 , and civ @xmath71542 emission lines , in addition to the visible lines already mentioned ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "however , according to this model the nebular civ @xmath71542 emission would occur in the vicinity of the dust reverberation radius , is quite likely attenuated by dust extinction , and is sufficiently distant from the central bh that it is expected to contribute only to the narrow component of civ @xmath71542 discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , the nebula is expected to contribute significantly to the observed broad ly@xmath0 emission , although it is difficult to explore further to what extent the nebula lines contribute in the uv given the shortcomings with cloudy explained previously in section 4.2 .",
    "a model has been presented which explains the relative intensities of the h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath13 , emission lines in terms of a spatially extended , spherically symmetric distribution of neutral h gas that is photoionized by the central uv  x - ray source .",
    "photoionization modeling with cloudy indicates that the h@xmath0/h@xmath1 emission line ratio is a proxy for gas density , and constrains the neutral h density , @xmath33 , to be log@xmath34@xmath33(@xmath5 ) = 7.4 at the balmer reverberation radius .",
    "collectively , the observations support a model , suggested previously by @xcite , in which the central uv  x - ray source is able to sublimate dust from a sizeable volume of h gas , permitting it to be photoionized .",
    "modeling with the photoionization code cloudy yields the following insights .",
    "first , the balmer emission line emissivity is essentially zero inside the balmer reverberation radius .",
    "thus , the balmer reverberation radius marks the perimeter of a central cavity inside of which there is no balmer emission providing a natural explanation for the finite width observed for the balmer emission lines .",
    "second , the h gas is totally ionized between the balmer reverberation radius and the dust reverberation radius .",
    "that same h gas is associated with an h@xmath0 emissivity that reproduces the overall shape of the observed h@xmath0 emission line expected for gas in free - fall .",
    "the cloudy model further predicts forbidden [ oiii ] emission lines that are one order of magnitude brighter than observed .",
    "the discrepancy may indicate that the observed [ oiii ] emission lines are attenuated by dust , or that the photoionized gas is of low metallicity , or both .",
    "a problem with the emergent line intensities computed by the cloudy photoionization code precludes further investigation of this particular observation .",
