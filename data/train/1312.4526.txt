    "the additional mass or kinetic energy due to the turbulence can be approximated by the factor given in subsection  [ dis - core ] , @xmath153 with the turbulent velocity , @xmath109 replaced as @xmath99 .",
    "we obtained the limit on @xmath109 a few times larger than that on the bulk velocity ( table  [ dis - com : summary ] ) .",
    "therefore the uncertainty from the turbulent motion dominates that from the ordered one .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  rgs was used to constrain the gas turbulent motions in hot gas in clusters and galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite analyzed rgs spectra of dozens of sources and found evidence for @xmath154 km s@xmath1 velocity line broadening and limits down to 300 km s@xmath1 for some systems .",
    "the rgs spectra can be used only for centrally - peaked x - ray line emission below 1.5  kev ( dominated by fe - l lines ) and results are coupled with the brightness distribution of the line emission which is not straightforward to model .    as described in subsection [ ana - center - lw ] ,",
    "the limit on @xmath109 is mostly limited by the instrumental energy resolution . therefore to improve the limit significantly high energy resolution instruments such as x - ray calorimeters are necessary .",
    "for example , direct and robust study will be obtained by sxs onboard astro - h  , providing 57  ev ( fwhm ) energy resolution , corresponding to 300 km s@xmath1 at the fe - k line .",
    "a 100 ksec sxs observation of the perseus center provides more than 10,000 counts in the he - like triplet emission and measurements of the turbulent along with those of bulk velocity structure .",
