    "@xmath8 predicts a branching ratio for @xmath0 of @xmath9 with the cut - off @xmath10 , to avoid the region with the pion pole which dominates the total rate @xcite . the amplitude can be calculated precisely as it is non - vanishing in lowest order chiral perturbation theory and expected to be quite insensitive to higher order corrections . with sufficient statistics ,",
    "the chiral structure of weak vertices could be tested experimentally in the high-@xmath6 region from a comparison with the predicted @xmath6-spectrum .",
    "the na48 detector , originally designed to measure the direct cp - violation parameter @xmath11 in neutral kaon decays with simultaneous @xmath12 and @xmath1 beams , was used to collect data for studies on rare @xmath1 decays during a test run in 1999 with a high - intensity @xmath1 beam .",
    "this beam had an intensity about 200 times higher than the one used in the @xmath11 runs .",
    "the present analysis is based on data collected during this 40-hour high - intensity @xmath1 run .",
    "neutral kaons were produced by a primary beam of @xmath13 protons , extracted from the sps accelerator during a 2.4 s spill every 14.4 s and impinging with an angle in the vertical plane of 4.2 mrad on a 2 mm diameter , 400 mm long beryllium target , at an intensity of @xmath14 protons per pulse .",
    "the target was followed by a sweeping magnet and a 0.36 cm diameter collimator to define a narrow beam of neutral kaons and hyperons .",
    "the beginning of the fiducial volume was set 500 cm downstream of the centre of the target , 1 m before the end of the collimator .",
    "the fiducial volume was contained in an 89 m long , evacuated steel cylinder and followed by the main na48 detector .",
    "the neutral particles of the beam were contained in a 156 mm diameter carbon - fibre pipe linked to the evacuated cylinder and passing through the detector , in order to avoid interactions of neutrons and photons from the beam .",
    "a detailed description of the detector and beam lines can be found elsewhere @xcite .    in the present analysis",
    "the following sub - detectors were used : a magnetic spectrometer composed of four drift chambers , two upstream and two downstream of a dipole magnet , for vetoing charged particles ; seven anti - counter rings ( akl ) of iron and plastic scintillator , for vetoing photons outside the acceptance of the main detector ; a quasi - homogeneous electromagnetic liquid - krypton calorimeter ( lkr ) , to measure energy , position and time of electromagnetic showers generated by photons ; a sampling hadron calorimeter composed of 96 steel and scintillator planes .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter is composed of 13212 readout tower cells of @xmath15 cross section and @xmath16 depth each .",
    "the energy resolution is @xcite @xmath17 with e in gev .",
    "the position and time resolutions for a single photon are better than 1 mm and 500 ps , respectively , for energies greater than 25 gev . the overall energy scale was determined by a fit of the position of an anti - counter ( aks ) used during @xmath11 runs .",
    "events satisfying the trigger conditions for @xmath18 or @xmath19 events were selected , since no dedicated trigger for @xmath20 ( and @xmath21 ) decays was set up during the special high - intensity @xmath1 run .",
    "the trigger decisions were based on quantities reconstructed from orthogonal projections of the energy deposit in the electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite .",
    "the trigger for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 decays required :    1 .",
    "the total deposited energy @xmath22 being larger than 50 gev ; 2 .   the centre of gravity of the event , computed from the first moments @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the energy in each projection , @xmath25 being less than 15 cm from the beam axis ; 3 .",
    "the decay vertex of the @xmath26 , computed from the second moments @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 being less than 15 m downstream from the end of the collimator .",

    ", @xmath30 is the @xmath31 coordinate of the electromagnetic calorimeter with respect to the target and @xmath32 is the kaon mass .",
    "the @xmath19 trigger required also at least 4 energy peaks in each projection .",
    "the cuts on the vertex for the @xmath18 trigger and on the maximum number of energy peaks for the @xmath19 trigger were varied during the run , while the downscaling factors were adjusted according to the obtained rate .",

    "the time of each cluster ( @xmath38 ) had to be within @xmath39 of the event time ( @xmath40 ) computed as the average of @xmath38 weighted over the energy ; 2 .   no other cluster ( not belonging to the combination considered ) with an energy greater than 1.5 gev had to be found within @xmath41 of the event time , to reduce the effect of accidental background ; 3 .",

    "@xmath35 events with misreconstructed cluster energy due to non - gaussian tails in the energy resolution were simulated and found to be concentrated in a region with @xmath64 below 300 . therefore a @xmath64 greater than 300 was required for the @xmath20 candidates . in order to compare data and simulation a control region with @xmath65 was defined and the distribution in @xmath64 is shown in fig .",

    "the expected background was then extrapolated from the sidebands to the signal region and compared with the expectation given by the simulation , applying the same selection .",
    "the two results are compatible within the statistical error and the relative difference of 24% is computed as systematic uncertainty .",
    "2 .   the different cut on @xmath64 between signal and normalisation ,",
    "together with a slightly different resolution of the best reconstructed @xmath62 mass between data and simulation , produced a systematic uncertainty of 0.6% on the ratio of acceptances when a window of @xmath63 is used for the cut on the @xmath18 invariant masses ; 3 .   from simulation the relative difference in the trigger efficiency between @xmath0 and @xmath58",
    "was computed to be about 1.7% ; 4 .",
