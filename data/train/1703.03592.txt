    "discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) methods have proved to be effective in the cfd field allowing to simulate complex physics in complex domains while guaranteeing accuracy and robustness . although very popular for compressible fluid flow simulations , their adoption by incompressible fluid flow practitioners is still limited due to difficulties involved in the numerical solution of the incompressible navier - stokes ( ins ) equations . on the one hand explicit and decoupled time integration strategies ( _ e.g._pressure poisson equation segregated methods )",
    "complicate the achievement of high - order pressure accuracy reducing the appeal of high - order accurate spatial discretizations .",
    "on the other hand fully implicit fully coupled velocity - pressure spatial discretisations result in systems of differential algebraic equations ( daes ) that are very expensive to solve due to the indefiniteness of the resulting system matrices , their poor spectral properties , and the saddle point nature of the problem @xcite .    in this work , in order to speed up the numerical solutions of coupled variables dg discretizations of incompressible flow problems , we consider @xmath0-multigrid solution strategies on @xmath0-coarsened mesh sequences generated by recursive agglomeration of a fine grid . @xmath0-multigrid",
    "is very attractive from the efficiency viewpoint in the sense that the number of arithmetic operations needed to solve a discrete problem is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "convergence factors , that is the average residual decrease at each multigrid iteration , can be made @xmath0-independent and small .    in the context of dg discretizations @xmath2-multigrid has been fruitfully applied in practical applications see _ e.g._@xcite , while the theoretical and practical investigation of @xmath0- and @xmath3-multigrid is more recent . in 2003",
    "gopalakrishnan and kanschat @xcite analyzed a v - cycle preconditioner for diffusion and advection - diffusion problems .",
    "multigrid algorithms for dg discretizations of elliptic problems were considered by brenner _",
    "et al._@xcite , who proved uniform convergence with respect to the number of levels for f-,v- and w - cycle on graded meshes , and antonietti _",
    "et al._@xcite , who provided similar results for w - cycle @xmath0-,@xmath2- and @xmath3-multigrid .",
    "while the previous works employed @xmath0-refined mesh sequences , prill _",
    "et al._@xcite considered smoothed aggregation to build coarse problems for @xmath0-multigrid dg solvers .",
    "the issue of developing optimal solvers for composite discontinuous galerkin methods , first developed and analyzed antonietti _",
    "et al._@xcite was considered by antonietti _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "more recently antonietti _",
    "et al._@xcite analysed multigrid strategies for interior penalty dg discretizations over agglomerated elements meshes , while wallraff and leicht @xcite and wallraff _",
    "et al._@xcite applied an agglomeration based @xmath0-multigrid solver to dg discretizations of the compressible reynolds averaged navier - stokes ( rans ) equations .",
    "@xmath0-coarsening by agglomeration leads to unprecedented flexibility in the definition of the coarse meshes .",
    "starting from a fine grid , a coarse mesh can be generated on the fly clustering together a number of mesh elements .",
    "the process can be repeated at will in a recursive manner resulting in a nested mesh sequence .",
    "note that the generation of a sequence of nested grids by recursive refinement of a coarse mesh , _ e.g._by means of element subdivision techniques , might require to improve the rough approximation of the computational domain provided by the coarse mesh .",
    "while coarsening by agglomeration is flexible enough to account for complex 3d domains , physical frame dg discretizations allows to handle polyhedral elements of very general shape @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as a consequence of the lack of efficient quadrature rules for agglomerated elements , numerical integration of bilinear and trilinear forms might lead to excessive matrix assembly costs , see bassi _ et al._@xcite .",
    "the present investigation focuses on efficiency of building coarse grid operators for dg discretizations of incompressible flow problems and effectiveness of the multigrid v - cycle iteration .",
    "in particular , we introduce a strategy for inheriting the br2 dg formulation of @xcite , which provides optimal convergence properties and does not require numerical integration during assembly of coarse grid operators .",
    "besides the br2 formulation , here employed for the discretization of the viscous terms , inherited multigrid can be fruitfully employed for the discrete divergence and the discrete gradient operators , and also for the discretization of the non - linear convective flux terms appearing in the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in section [ sec : agglodgd ]",
    "we introduce agglomeration based dg discretization over @xmath0-coarsened mesh sequences .",
    "section [ sec : dg_flow ] is dedicated to presenting dg discretizations of incompressible flow problems :    the incompressible navier - stokes equations spatial and temporal discretization in section [ sec : dg_ns ] and [ sec : dg_ns_t ] , respectively ;    the discretization of the steady stokes problem in section [ sec : dg_stk ] ;    the br2 dg formulation in section [ sec : lapbr2 ] .",
    "the ingredients of the @xmath0-multigrid iteration are described in section [ sec : multiall ] :    the v - cycle in section [ sec : multivcicle ] ;    intergrid transfer operators in section [ sec : intergrid ] ;    inherited coarse grid operators in section [ sec : coarsegridop ] .",
    "section [ sec : precins ] briefly comments on the use of the @xmath0-multigrid v - cycle iteration as a preconditioner for iterative solvers and introduces block preconditioners for the stokes problem .",
    "performance gain assessment as compared to state - of - the - art iterative and direct solvers is conducted in section [ sec : numres ] .",
    "we consider    elliptic problems in section [ sec : numresbr2 ] ;    linear stokes problems in section [ sec : numresstokes ] ;    non - linear incompressible flow problems in section [ sec : numresns ] .",
    "let @xmath4 be a bounded connected open domain . consider a ( possibly non conforming ) mesh @xmath5 of @xmath4 composed of ( possibly curved ) elements @xmath6 such that    for any @xmath6 , there exists a reference polygon @xmath7 and a polynomial mapping @xmath8 such that @xmath9 .",
    "quadrature rules of arbitrary order are available on the reference polygon @xmath7 .",
    "the set of reference polygons includes but is not limited to triangular and quadrilateral reference elements in 2d , tetrahedral , hexahedral , pyramidal and prismatic reference elements in 3d .",
    "starting from @xmath5 we can define a sequence of coarsened meshes @xmath10 by agglomeration , see figure [ fig : grid_seq ] . for the sake of notation we denote by @xmath11 any element @xmath12",
    "whose diameter is @xmath13 , and we denote the mesh size of @xmath14 , by @xmath15 .",
    "agglomeration generates a hierarchic sequence of nested grids , in particular for any @xmath16 , we suppose that    * @xmath17 is a disjoint partition of @xmath4 obtained clustering together the elements of @xmath18 ; * every @xmath19 is an open bounded connected subset of @xmath4 and there exists @xmath20 such that @xmath21 the @xmath22 cells clustered into the agglomerated element @xmath23 are referred to as sub - elements . * for every @xmath24 there exists @xmath25 such that @xmath26 this can be obtained by applying recursively and formalizes the fact that agglomerated elements on any mesh level @xmath27 can be expressed as a composition of elements belonging to the finer mesh @xmath5 .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     for solving the linearized systems of the be method one iteration of @xmath28 cycle is used as a preconditioner for the fmgres(60 ) solver .",
    "high - order modes of the error are smoothed with a single iteration of an asm preconditioned gmres solver while we require a four order of magnitude residual decrease for the asm preconditioned gmres solver on level @xmath29 .",
    "asm preconditioners employ one level of overlap between sub - domains and an ilu decompositions for each sub - domain matrix .",
    "table [ tab : conv_multasprec_aneu ] reports the maximum and average convergence rates measured over the third cardiac cycle . since the time step is fixed , the gap between maximum and average converge factors is narrower than in the pseudo - transient continuation strategy , _ cf._table [ tab : conv_multasprec_lid3d ] , and reflects the influence of varying the reynolds number . in particular",
    "the maximum convergence factor is recorded during systole where convection is more pronounced as compared to diastole .    even if the average convergence rates reported in table [ tab : conv_multasprec_aneu ] are less satisfactory that in the lid - driven cavity case , the fact that the linear system residual halves at each fgmres iteration is a significant achievement .",
    "hemodynamic computations are considered very challenging from the numerical solution viewpoint , to the point that even segregated pressure corrections strategies might require ad - hoc preconditioners @xcite .",
    "this work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of @xmath0-multigrid preconditioners applied to high - order accurate dg discretizations of incompressible flow problems . in view of efficiency agglomeration",
    "based @xmath0-multigrid strategies with inherited coarse grid operators are attractive because the expensive process of numerically integrating over agglomerated elements can be avoided in all but the preprocessing phase .",
    "indeed , intergrid transfer operators can be computed once prior to the non - linear iteration , and stored for later use . in this work we introduced an effective strategy for improving performance of inherited coarse grid operators which exploits a rescaled galerkin projection of the br2 dg discretization stabilization term . using a single iteration of preconditioned gmres as smoothing strategy",
    ", the multigrid convergence is uniform with respect to the number of levels and the _ typical multigrid efficiency _ is closely approached on model problems .",
    "the ability to beat direct solvers on arbitrarily unstructured low quality grids and the appealing performance obtained on parallel real - life computations might revert the common belief that discontinuous galerkin discretizations are more expensive to solve as compared to standard finite element and finite volume formulations .",
    "we provide implementations details about the matrix - free implementation of the restriction of coarse grid operators . for the sake of brevity we consider inheritance of the br2 bilinear forms , the stokes and navier - stokes",
    "coarse grid operators can be obtained in a similar fashion . note that br2 coarse grid operators involve galerkin projections for consistency terms , see equation and the rescaled galerkin projection for the stabilization term , see equation .",
    "the matrices counterparts @xmath30 of the operators @xmath31 are sparse block matrices of size @xmath32 ( the block size is @xmath33 ) composed of diagonal blocks @xmath34 and off - diagonal blocks @xmath35 .",
    "off - diagonal blocks are responsible of the coupling between neighboring elements @xmath36 sharing a face @xmath37 .",
    "the coarse operators @xmath38 are obtained matrix - free as described in algorithms [ algo : f2ctwo_m ] and [ algo : f2ctwo_m_two ] .",
    "[ algo : f2ctwo_m ]    [ algo : f2ctwo_m_two ]    matrix restriction is performed contextually to fine matrix assembly so that stability term contributions @xmath39 , and consistency - symmetry terms contributions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , see section [ sec : coarsebr2 ] , are restricted separately , before being collected into diagonal and off - diagonal blocks of the fine matrix .",
    "it is interesting to remark that only a subset of the internal faces contributions on level @xmath27 is restricted on level @xmath42 .",
    "in particular we remark that all diagonal and off - diagonal contributions @xmath43 associated to facets @xmath44 that do not belong to the boundary of agglomerated elements on level @xmath42 are ignored in algorithm [ algo : f2ctwo_m_two ] .",
    "this optimization is permitted thanks to the local conservation properties of dg formulations .",
