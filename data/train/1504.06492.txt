    "during the last decades , remarkable progress was made in description of nuclear dynamics within self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) models ( skyrme , gogny , relativistic ) , see e.g. the reviews @xcite . in particular , a variety of quasiparticle random - phase - approximation ( qrpa ) methods was developed for the exploration of small - amplitude excitations in deformed nuclei , @xcite .",
    "so far these methods were mainly used for the description of giant resonances ( gr ) in light @xcite and medium / heavy @xcite nuclei .",
    "however , self - consistent qrpa was still rarely employed for the exploration of the lowest vibrational states ( @xmath6- , @xmath0- , octupole ) in deformed rare - earth and actinide nuclei @xcite ( despite rich available experimental information for these regions @xcite ) .",
    "this is partly due to the huge configuration spaces required for such deformed heavy nuclei .",
    "however , the main problem lies in a high sensitivity of the lowest vibrational states ( lvs ) to various factors . following early calculations within the schematic quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite",
    ", the description of lvs requires a proper treatment of the single - particle ( s - p ) spectra near the fermi level , equilibrium deformation , pairing with the blocking effect , residual interaction ( with both particle - hole and particle - particle channels ) , coupling to complex configurations ( with taking into account the pauli principle ) , and exclusion of the spurious admixtures . besides , the description of lvs should be consistent with the treatment of other collective modes , e.g. multipole gr .",
    "all these factors and requirements make the self - consistent description of lvs very demanding .",
    "so far we are aware of two self - consistent qrpa studies of lvs in rare - earth and actinide regions , one with gogny forces for @xmath7u @xcite and another with skyrme forces for rare - earth nuclei @xcite .",
    "actually only the last study @xcite is systematic .",
    "it covers @xmath0-vibrational @xmath8 and @xmath6-vibrational @xmath9 states in 27 rare - earth nuclei .",
    "the skyrme forces skm@xmath5 @xcite and sly4 @xcite are used and performance of skm@xmath5 is found noticeably better than of sly4 .",
    "it is deduced that skyrme qrpa is a reasonable basis for the investigation of lvs .    in the present paper , we continue the systematic exploration of @xmath4-states in axial deformed nuclei with qrpa using skyrme forces .",
    "the @xmath4-states are chosen as the simplest case where we do not meet the problem of the extraction of the spurious admixtures . as compared to @xcite",
    ", our study has some important new aspects .",
    "first , it is desirable to use for description of @xmath4-states the skyrme forces which simultaneously reproduce the energy of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isgqr ) .",
    "following @xcite , these forces should have a large isoscalar effective mass @xmath10 .",
    "the forces from @xcite have low effective masses , @xmath110.70 for sly4 @xcite and 0.79 for skm@xmath5 @xcite , and so overestimate the isgqr energy , see @xcite and discussion below . to make the description of isgqr and @xmath4-states consistent , we use in our calculations the recent sv - bas force @xcite with @xmath10=0.9 . as shown below",
    ", sv - bas also manages to reproduce systematically well ground state deformations , a feature which is utterly crucial for a correct placing of lvs .",
    "note that very similar results were earlier obtained @xcite with the skyrme force sv - mas10 @xcite ( @xmath10=1.0 ) .",
    "we choose here sv - bas as a more general parametrization which was already used in various studies , see e.g. @xcite . for comparison with @xcite , the force skm@xmath5",
    "is also implemented .",
    "second , we take into account the pairing blocking effect ( pbe ) @xcite which , following qpm studies @xcite , can be important for qrpa description of lvs in axially deformed nuclei .",
    "the pbe weakens the pairing and thus downshifts energies of low - energy two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) states by a few hundreds kev @xcite , which in turn decreases the qrpa energies of @xmath4-states .",
    "this effect can be especially important for slightly collective states ( with one or two dominant 2qp components ) which are often encountered amongst @xmath4-states .",
    "we implement pbe within the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) scheme using volume pairing @xcite . the same volume pairing , though in the framework of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach without pbe , was used in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we are taking from the pbe only one aspect , namely the modification of 2qp energies .",
    "the 2qp states as such ( s.p . wave functions and pairing occupation amplitudes ) remain untouched .",
    "this ad hoc solution to the problem with the energies of @xmath4-states is admittedly not consistent .",
    "however it has a great advantage not to disturb the orthonormality of 2qp basis and thus allows to use the standard qrpa procedure . at the same time , following previous schematic @xcite and our present studies , the pbe for @xmath4-states in medium and heavy deformed nuclei can be strong and certainly deserves the consideration . in this connection , our pbe - qrpa calculations can be viewed as a first step highlighting the problem and calling for further checking within a self - consistent pbe - qrpa prescription , yet to be developed .",
    "the third new aspect is that we provide a detailed analysis of the obtained results , both numerically and analytically ( e.g. in terms of simplified models for schematic rpa ) .",
    "we determine domains of nuclei with low and high collectivity of @xmath4-states and demonstrate that the lowest @xmath1 2qp state plays a key role in formation of these domains .",
    "the study embraces 9 isotopic chains ( nd , sm , gd , dy , er , yb , hf , w , u ) with 41 axially deformed nuclei , as compared to 27 rare - earth nuclei in @xcite .",
    "the calculations are performed within the separable random - phase - approximation ( srpa ) method based on the skyrme functional @xcite .",
    "the method is developed in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) version for spherical nuclei @xcite and a two - dimensional ( 2d ) version @xcite for axial deformed nuclei .",
    "srpa is derived self - consistently : i ) both the mean field and residual interaction are obtained from the same skyrme functional , ii ) the residual interaction includes all terms of the skyrme functional as well as the coulomb ( direct and exchange ) terms .",
    "the self - consistent factorization of the residual interaction dramatically reduces the computational effort for deformed nuclei while keeping high accuracy of the method .",
    "however srpa is not self - consistent in the part of the pairing interaction because i ) ad hoc implementation of pbe into qrpa and ii ) skipping the particle - particle channel in the residual interaction . in earlier studies ,",
    "srpa was successfully applied for the description of various gr in spherical and deformed nuclei : e1(t=1 ) and e2(t=0 ) @xcite , toroidal / compression e1 @xcite , and spin - flip m1 @xcite ) .",
    "however , the success of the model for gr does not mean that it is also robust in description of so fragile excitations as lvs . in this connection",
    ", we compare below some srpa results with those obtained with the exact ( no the separable ansatz ) 2d qrpa code @xcite .",
    "we find a nice agreement which confirms that srpa is accurate enough to pretend for description of @xmath4 states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , method and calculational details are outlined .",
    "the equations for the pairing blocking are given , the srpa scheme is sketched , and srpa results are compared with those from the exact qrpa . it is shown that sv - bas , unlike skm * , nicely reproduces equilibrium quadrupole deformations and the isqgr energy .",

    "the basic srpa equations are outlined . in appendix c ,",
    "a simple two - pole rpa model is presented to be applied for explanation of the domains with low and high collectivity of @xmath4-states . in appendix",
    "d , srpa strength constants of the residual interaction are compared with those of the qpm .",
    "the srpa approach @xcite used in this paper is based on the skyrme functional @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the kinetic energy , @xmath14 is the potential energy according to the skyrme functional , @xmath15 is the coulomb energy , and @xmath16 is the pairing energy . the coulomb exchange term is treated in slater approximation .",
    "the volume pairing corresponds to a zero - range pairing interaction .",
    "the skyrme part @xmath14 depends on the local densities and currents : density @xmath17 , kinetic - energy density @xmath18 , spin - orbit density @xmath19 , current @xmath20 , spin - density @xmath21 , and spin - kinetic - energy density @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian and srpa residual interaction are self - consistently determined through the first and second functional derivatives of ( [ 1 ] ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "further details of the model and calculation scheme are given below .",
    "the stationary 2d mean - field calculations are performed with the skyax code @xcite in cylindrical coordinates using a mesh size of 0.5 fm and a box size of about three nuclear radii .",
    "the single - particle space is chosen to embrace the levels from the bottom of the potential well up to energy 15 - 20 mev .",
    "for sv - bas , the s - p schemes involve 304 proton and 375 neutron levels in @xmath23nd and 379 proton and 485 neutron levels in @xmath7u .",
    "the ground state is obtained by solving the mean - field equations and resides at the minimum of the total energy ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "its axial quadrupole deformation is characterized by the dimensionless deformation parameter @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the quadrupole moment , @xmath26 , a is the mass number .",
    "figure [ fig : deform1 ] compares deformation parameters calculated using sv - bas with available experimental data @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : deform2 ] shows the same comparison for skm@xmath5 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show very nice agreement for sv - bas while skm@xmath5 systematically overestimates @xmath27 , especially in yb , hf , w , and u isotopes .",
    "note that both sv - bas and skm@xmath5 fail to describe the specifically low values of experimental @xmath27 in @xmath28yb and @xmath29hf .",
    "note also the exceptionally large error bars in @xmath28hf .",
    "parameter @xmath27 of the axial quadrupole deformation in rare - earth and actinide nuclei .",
    "the values calculated with sv - bas @xcite ( full symbols ) are compared with the experimental data @xcite ( open symbols with error bars).,width=321 ]    the same as fig .",
    "[ fig : deform1 ] but for skm@xmath5.,width=321 ]      the volume pairing interaction reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 stands for protons or neutrons and @xmath32 are pairing strengths . in the present study pairing",
    "is treated at the bcs level @xcite .",
    "if the pairing - blocking effect ( pbe ) is accounted for , the bcs problem is solved separately for the ground @xmath33 and excited n - quasiparticle @xmath34 states . for the ground state ,",

    ", the bcs equations for axially deformed nuclei ( with doubly degenerate s - p levels ) have a peculiarity : if some states from the set @xmath44 are unpaired , then these states are excluded from the pairing scheme and contribute to the bcs equations as pure single - particle states .",
    "the physics behind is obvious : if some level is occupied by an unpaired nucleon , then it is closed ( = blocked ) for the pairing process which transfers nuclear pairs .",
    "this is why it is called pairing blocking effect @xcite .",
    "the pbe takes place in both bcs and hfb theories as soon as we deal with n - quasiparticle excitations .",
    "most often the pbe is considered for 1qp excitations in odd and odd - odd nuclei , see e.g. @xcite and more references in @xcite .",
    "following qpm studies @xcite , the pbe may play a role in qrpa description of lvs in even - even axially deformed nuclei .",
    "indeed 2qp states constitute the configuration space for qrpa .",
    "the first low - energy 2qp states are the main contributors to the lowest qrpa excitation .",
    "so it is worth to check how pbe for the low - energy 2qp states affects the description of lvs .",
    "the main effect of the pbe is to change the 2qp energies @xcite .",
    "thus we use here in ad - hoc manner only one pbe output , pbe - corrected 2qp energies . only them are implemented to qrpa while the occupation amplitudes ( @xmath45 ) and s.p .",
    "wave functions are kept the same as in the bcs ground state .",
    "this has the advantage that orthonormality of the 2qp configuration space is maintained and the standard qrpa scheme remains applicable .    usually in bcs+qrpa calculations",
    "the 2qp - energies are computed by using the pairing gaps @xmath46 , chemical potentials @xmath47 and bogoliubov coefficients @xmath48 for the ground bcs state , yielding @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the energy of the 1qp state , @xmath51 is the renormalized s - p energy ( see the expression below ) . in hfb+qrpa calculations ,",
    "the 2qp states for the qrpa configuration space are also expressed in terms of ground state values . in particular , their energies are calculated as a sum of two 1qp energies in the canonical basis using the hfb solutions for the ground state , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "both such bcs and hfb schemes do not include the pbe for the 2qp states .",
    "following qpm and our calculations , such a treatment can be insufficient for a correct description of the lvs .    for @xmath1 states",

    "the values @xmath74 in ( [ 30 ] ) are for the ground state .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) , ( [ 35 ] ) , ( [ 38 ] ) show that pbe excludes the states @xmath75 and @xmath41 from the pairing sums .",
    "these blocked states do not contribute to the pairing gap ( [ 34 ] ) and enter ( [ 35 ] ) and ( [ 38 ] ) as single - particle ( not quasi - particle ) states .",
    "the sums in ( [ 34 ] ) , ( [ 35 ] ) , and ( [ 38 ] ) are usually dominated by a few @xmath64-states around the fermi level .",
    "if the states @xmath75 and @xmath41 belong to this group , then their blocking can effectively decrease the level density near the fermi level and thus the pairing gap ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "consequently the energy ( [ 38 ] ) is changed . in such cases ,",
    "the pairing is significantly suppressed and the bcs - pbe value for the 2qp energy([37 ] ) becomes a few hundreds of kev smaller than the bcs energy ( [ eps_ij ] ) @xcite .",
    "this in turn leads to a significant downshift of the energy of the first qrpa solution .    in the present study ,",
    "we block the five lowest @xmath1 2qp states ( proton and neutron altogether ) .",
    "the calculations show that this number of blocked states is optimal .",
    "more blocking would involve the states remote by energy from the fermi level and thus with a negligible pbe . less blocking is likely to miss a part of the pbe corrections .",
    "we substitute the pbe - corrected energies @xmath76 to srpa replacing the @xmath77 .",
    "however we do not use the pbe modified bogoliubov coefficients @xmath78 .",
    "instead we continue to employ in qrpa the ground state set @xmath79 and wave functions .",
    "this leaves the 2qp basis orthonormalized and renders our pbe - srpa scheme easily applicable .",
    "it is also worth to inspect a possible impact of our scheme on the basic features of qrpa , namely stability of the qrpa interaction matrix , elimination of spurious modes , and sum rules : i ) concerning the qrpa matrix , the pbe - induced reduction of the positive diagonal elements ( 2qp energies ) of the matrix indeed can cause instabilities in some cases .",
    "this is checked numerically .",
    "we find that for the @xmath1 states studied here the qrpa remains in the stable regime .",
    "the only exception is @xmath80dy in the calculations with the force skm * , see discussion below .",
    "ii ) spurious modes must be carefully checked when trying to apply the pbe to other quadrupole states , say with @xmath81 and @xmath82 , but not in our case . for @xmath1 states considered in the present study",
    "the spurious modes are absent at all .",
    "iii ) concerning the sum rules , there is some quantitative effect .",
    "but it is extremely small as the main contribution to sum rules comes from higher lying states which are not affected by the pbe .",
    "altogether , the present ad hoc implementation of the pbe looks robust . it still calls for a thorough formal self - consistent development which , however , will be tedious and take time .",
    "we consider the present study as a first step in exploration of the impact of the pbe on low - lying spectra of @xmath1 states .",
    "the pbe should be applied with care in case of a weak pairing because the blocking reduces pairing and may trigger its full break - down . in the worst case , a more involved formalism ( allowing a weak pairing ) should be used , e.g. the method with particle - number projection before variation @xcite .",
    "calculations with this method show that bcs - pbe somewhat underestimates the 2qp energies @xcite .",
    "however , the projection method requires a huge effort and it can not be consistently applied for skyrme energy functional @xcite .",
    "so we use here bcs - pbe , though with staying alert for suspect cases .      the srpa formalism for axial nuclei",
    "is described in detail elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we sketch only the points relevant for the present study . as mentioned above , the srpa formalism starts from the functional ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the residual interaction includes contributions from both time - even and time - odd densities and also takes care of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the coupling between the quadrupole @xmath83=22 and hexadecapole @xmath83=42 modes , pertinent to deformed nuclei , is included . the basic srpa equations and more calculation details can be found in the appendix b.",
    "the present srpa version skips the particle - particle ( hole - hole ) channel for @xmath1 states . in qpm",
    "the pp - channel is used to harmonize description of lvs energies and transition probabilities @xcite but these calculations are not self - consistent .",
    "the self - consistent skyrme bcs - qrpa calculations for spherical nuclei show that the pp - channel tends to decrease the lvs energies @xcite .",
    "if so , then this effect can be partly compensated by the energy upshift gained by using the particle - projection method @xcite .",
    "the skyrme hfb - qrpa studies of lvs in deformed nuclei use the pp - channel only partly @xcite if at all @xcite . in general , the pp - channel , being crucial for @xmath6-vibrational @xmath81 states , seems not to be so important for @xmath0-vibrational @xmath1 states .",

    "the calculations are performed for the skyrme parametrizations sv - bas and skm@xmath5 . as mentioned in the introduction , sv - bas",
    "is chosen because it provides an accurate description of the ground state deformations and isgqr energies .",

    "however , unlike the case of light rare - earth nuclei in figs .",
    "5 - 6 , we also see a significant difference in the results of sv - bas and skm@xmath5 . first , as compared to sv - bas results and experimental data , the skm@xmath5 energies in er and yb isotopes strongly fluctuate with a , closely following variations of 2p energies ( this feature of skm@xmath5 results was also mentioned in @xcite ) .",
    "such fluctuations point to a small collectivity of @xmath4 states and significant contribution of the lowest 2qp state to the structure of @xmath4 state .",
    "furthermore , the 2qp energies are generally smaller for skm@xmath5 than for sv - bas , which results in a better average description of @xmath104 in er and yb with skm@xmath5 .",
    "the pbe gives here larger changes than for nd - sm - gd isotopes .",
    "in particular , it leads to a huge decrease of @xmath4-energy in @xmath80dy ( like in @xcite ) .",
    "this state becomes extremely collective ( see a huge overestimation of experimental b(e2 ) ) .",
    "it is unlikely that it can be described within a familiar qrpa and needs a more involved prescription taking into account large ground state correlations @xcite .",
    "the srpa results agree with hfb - qrpa ones @xcite for er - yb but not for dy , especially in the exceptional case of @xmath80dy .",
    "9 - 10 show the results for heavy rare - earth hf - w and actinide u isotopes .",
    "for both forces , the collectivity of @xmath4 states increases from hf to w and decreases in u. moreover , both forces give rather similar trends of @xmath101 with a , though deviating from the experimental ones .",
    "the pbe considerably downshifts the 2qp and srpa energies and thus in general improves their description . in average , skm@xmath5 energies are closer to @xmath104 than sv - bas ones but give more fuzzy a - dependence , especially with pbe . in u isotopes ,",
    "the description of the spectra with skm@xmath5 is much better than with sv - bas , which again is explained by lower 2qp energies in skm@xmath5 .",
    "the description of b(e2 ) is acceptable in heavy hf isotopes for both sv - bas and skm@xmath5 . with exception of @xmath105w",
    ", the pbe does not affect the description of b(e2 ) .    altogether , the results from figs .",
    "5 - 10 allow to do the following conclusions : i ) in rare - earth and actinide regions , there are pronounced isotopic domains with low and high collectivity of @xmath4 states .",
    "ii ) the best agreement with the experimental data is obtained for dy ( except for @xmath80dy ) and w isotopes , i.e. for the most collective @xmath4 states characterized by large @xmath102 and b(e2 ) values .",
    "iii ) the pbe essentially downshifts 2qp and qrpa energies , thus leading to a better agreement with experiment .",
    "the value of the downshift is comparable with the collective shift @xmath89e of qrpa and much larger than the experimental errors @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the pbe plays a non - negligible role for energies of low lying states . at the same time",
    ", the blocking also can have a small effect on the b(e2 ) values .",
    "note that the results iii ) should be checked within a truly self - consistent pbe - qrpa approach yet to be developed .",
    "the above conclusions are supported by both sv - bas and skm@xmath5 .",
    "these two forces give similar results in light rare - earth nuclei but deviate in heavier nuclei . in sv - bas ,",
    "the @xmath101 vary less with system size @xmath106 but are usually larger than @xmath104 . in skm@xmath5 ,",
    "the variation of @xmath101 is stronger but this force gives lower 2qp and srpa energies and thus better describes @xmath104 , e.g. in u isotopes .",
    "the differences are partly caused by a weaker pairing in skm@xmath5 ( the gaps in skm@xmath5 are in average 30 - 50@xmath95 smaller than in sv - bas ) .",
    "the latter in turn can follow from different level densities of sv - bas and skm@xmath5 s - p spectra .",
    "it is also useful to inspect the r.m.s .",
    "deviations of the calculated results from the experimental data , @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are calculated and experimental values , @xmath110 is the number of involved nuclei .",
    "the deviations for the qrpa energies ( @xmath111 ) and b(e2)-values ( @xmath112 ) are presented in table [ tab : diff ] .",

    "* srpa deviations ( without blocking ) are compared with those of ref .",
    "@xcite ( manually obtained from the figures of @xcite ) .",
    "table [ tab : diff ] confirms that inclusion of pbe significantly improves description of @xmath4-energies but somewhat worsens reproduction of b(e2 ) .",
    "this takes place for both sv - bas and skm*. in agreement with previous findings , the skm * noticeably better describes the energies than sv - bas . as compared to @xcite , srpa demonstrates the better ( similar ) performance for @xmath4-energies for the cases with ( without ) pbe .",
    "however srpa results are generally worse for b(e2 ) .",
    "perhaps the latter is caused by the impact of the pp - channel which is included in @xcite but skipped in srpa .    following table [ tab : diff ] , the performance of both srpa and hfb+qrpa @xcite is generally not good .",
    "the deviations @xmath113 are large .",
    "this calls for further improvement of the description , e.g. for inclusion of the coupling to complex configurations ( ccc ) .",
    "the calculated qrpa energies of @xmath4 states mostly overestimate the experimental values .",
    "thus we still have a window for ccc which , being a sort of additional correlations , can in some cases downshift the energies of the lowest excited states .",
    ".[tab : diff]deviations between the calculated and experimental values of @xmath4-energies ( @xmath111)and b(e2)-strengths ( @xmath112 ) .",

    "the srpa deviations are compared with ones from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in this subsection , we analyze the above results and compare them with earlier studies @xcite .",
    "first of all , it is worth to explore the origin of domains with low and high collectivity of @xmath4 states .",
    "the low - collectivity domains include most of nd , er , yb , hf , and u isotopes .",
    "high collectivity exists in sm , gd , dy , and w isotopes . table [ tab : poles ] shows that the appearance of such domains is determined by the structure of the first 2qp states which , in turn , results in different absolute values of the matrix element @xmath115 for the doorway operator @xmath116 .",
    "these 2qp states are built from the levels close to the the fermi level .",
    "high collectivity ( pertinent to @xmath98sm , @xmath117dy , @xmath118hf , and @xmath119w ) takes place if the state is characterized by a large value of @xmath120 . instead ,",
    "if @xmath120 is small , then we get non - collective @xmath4 states ( @xmath88yb and @xmath121hf ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath120 is determined by nilsson selection rules for e2(k=2 ) transitions in axial nuclei @xcite .",
    "the rules read @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the principle quantum shell number , @xmath124 is the fraction of @xmath123 along the z - axis , @xmath125 is the orbital momentum projection onto z - axis .",
    "all the 2qp states in table [ tab : poles ] fulfill the rules ( [ eq : select ] ) for @xmath126 and @xmath123 but not for @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "table [ tab : poles ] shows that the rule @xmath127 is decisive .",
    "the 2qp states which keep this rule ( @xmath98sm , @xmath117dy , @xmath118hf , @xmath119w ) exhibit @xmath120-values of one order of magnitude larger than states violating the rule ( @xmath88yb and @xmath121hf ) .",
    "this effect is especially spectacular for neighboring isotopes @xmath121hf - @xmath118hf .",
    "the rule @xmath128 is not so crucial .",
    "however , matrix elements are additionally increased if this rule is obeyed ( @xmath118hf , @xmath119w ) .",
    "table [ tab : poles ] obviously suggests that just the strength @xmath120 of the first 2qp state is decisive for the collectivity of the qrpa @xmath4 state and formation of the domains with low and high collectivity .",
    "this finding can be corroborated within a simple two - pole model given in appendix c. following this model , the collectivity of the lowest qrpa states is mainly determined by the ratio between the strengths of the first ( @xmath129 = 1 ) and second ( @xmath129 = 2 ) 2qp states where the second state simulates a cumulative effect of all 2qp states with @xmath1301 .",
    "depending on this ratio , different scenarios can take place : high - collective limit , intermediate case and low - collective limit . in the last case",
    ", the first qrpa energy can lie even a bit above the first 2qp state , which happens , e.g. , in our calculations for yb isotopes .",
    "altogether , we get a simple recipe for predicting the collectivity of the first qrpa state : it suffices to inspect the nilsson selection rules ( [ eq : select ] ) for the lowest 2qp state , first of all @xmath131 .",
    "note that , unlike s - p spectra , the s - p wave functions and thus the values @xmath120 only slightly depend on the skyrme parametrization @xcite , which makes the proposed recipe quite reliable .",
    "as seen from table 1 , sv - bas and skm@xmath5 sometimes give different lowest 2qp states .",
    "nonetheless , the correlation between @xmath127 rule and collectivity of qrpa @xmath4-states applies in all considered cases .",
    "the nucleus @xmath80dy computed with skm@xmath5 shows a remarkable sequence of four strong ( @xmath120=5.8 - 9.2 @xmath132 ) 2qp states which are located with pbe at 0.86 - 1.96 mev .",
    "the cumulative impact of these states delivers a dramatic effect : a break - down of rpa . without pbe , these four 2qp states lie at a higher energy 1.422.15 mev and do not lead to the instability . for comparison ,",
    "sv - bas gives in @xmath80dy only three strong ( @xmath120=5.4 - 6.6 @xmath132 ) 2qp states and they are located at a higher energy 1.35 - 1.65 mev .",
    "this gives a collective @xmath4-state still within qrpa .",
    "altogether , this discussion shows that some qrpa results for low lying states can be quite sensitive to the skyrme force .",
    "table [ tab : poles ] shows that the values of collective shifts @xmath102 ( up to 0.9 mev ) and blocking induced shifts @xmath133 ( up to 0.6 mev ) are comparable . thus the pbe has a non - negligible effect in the present calculations .",
    "the results exhibited in figs . 5 - 10 indicate that the present skyrme qrpa description of @xmath4 states is not yet fully satisfactory .",
    "though we get rather good agreement with experimental data for collective @xmath4 states in gd , dy , and w isotopes , collectivity is generally underestimated in other isotopic chains ( which is seen from too high srpa energies and sizable low b(e2)-values ) .",
    "perhaps the latter cases require a coupling to complex configurations , which might affect both the @xmath4-energies and @xmath3-values . in this respect ,",
    "our calculations indicate regions where ccc is needed . in the previous skyrme qrpa study @xcite , the need for ccc",
    "was also pointed out . in nuclei like @xmath80dy ,",
    "an approach taking into account large ground state correlations is necessary @xcite .    as seen in figs . 5 - 10 ,",
    "the performances of our and previous @xcite systematic skyrme qrpa calculations ( without the pbe ) are rather similar .",
    "although these calculations exploit different prescriptions , hfb + exact qrpa in @xcite and bcs+pbe + separable qrpa in the present study , they provide a remarkably similar description of qrpa energies of @xmath4 states .",
    "the results @xcite are somewhat better for b(e2)-values , though the difference is not crucial .",
    "since srpa operates with the residual interaction in a separable form , it can be directly compared with schematic separable qrpa approaches , e.g. with qpm which is widely and successfully used in nuclear spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the qpm proposes some simple relations for the strength constants of the residual interaction which might be useful for a rough evaluation of the srpa strength constants .",
    "this analysis is done in the appendix c. it is shown that the mixed isoscalar - isovector interaction might be essential in skyrme qrpa .",
    "if this interaction is not properly balanced , it can weaken a general isoscalar effect of the residual interaction and thus make @xmath4 states less collective ( which might be relevant for nd , yb , hf , u isotopes ) .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of the lowest @xmath0-vibrational @xmath1 states in axially deformed even - even rare - earth and actinide nuclei within a self - consistent ( except for the pairing part ) separable random - phase - approximation ( srpa ) @xcite .",
    "nine isotopic chains involving 41 nuclei were explored .",
    "the excitation energies and b(e2)-values of @xmath4 states were computed and analyzed .",
    "the skyrme forces sv - bas @xcite and skm@xmath5 @xcite were used .",
    "the force sv - bas was chosen as providing a good description of ground state deformations and isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance ( isgqr ) .",
    "skm@xmath5 was used as a force with the best performance in the previous systematic study of @xmath4 states @xcite , performed within the exact ( not factorized ) skyrme hfb+qrpa .",
    "the accuracy of srpa was confirmed by comparison with calculations within exact bcs+qrpa @xcite and bcs+qrpa @xcite .",
    "our study undertakes some important steps which were not realized earlier @xcite .",
    "some essential points concerning the pairing contribution , systematics of @xmath4 states and explanation of the results were scrutinized .",
    "first , we have investigated a possible impact of the pairing blocking effect ( pbe ) on the properties of @xmath4 states .",
    "thereby we use in `` ad hoc '' manner from the pbe only the correction of 2qp energies while the 2qp wave functions remain the same as in the bcs ground state .",
    "this scheme has significant advantages : it incorporates the most essential energy correction from pbe but maintains , at the same time , the orthonormality of the 2qp configuration space which , in turn , allows to apply the standard qrpa solution scheme .",
    "this blocking scheme was applied to a few lowest two - quasiparticle ( 2qp ) configurations whose corrected energies were then used in srpa calculations . within this scheme ,",
    "the pbe significantly downshifts the srpa energies of @xmath4 states and thus improves agreement with the experimental spectra . at the same time , pbe rather slightly affects collectivity of the states , expressed in terms of collective shifts and transition probabilities b(e2 ) .",
    "it is to be noted , that our present handling of the pbe is very preliminary and should be further checked in fully developed self - consistent qrpa with pbe . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such methods are still absent .",
    "then our study can be viewed as a first step which highlights the problem and calls for a further self - consistent exploration .",
    "note also that the pbe - qrpa scheme is certainly not the only way to improve the description of @xmath4 states .",
    "various many - body techniques that go beyond the plain qrpa , first of all the coupling to complex configuration , can be decisive here .    as the next novel aspect of our study",
    ", we have singled out domains of nuclei with a low and high collectivity of @xmath4 states .",
    "it was shown that collectivity is mostly determined by the structure of the lowest 2qp state constituting the first srpa 2qp state .",
    "the effect was explained in terms of the nilsson selection rule @xmath134=0 , which delivers a simple recipe to predict the @xmath4-collectivity without performing qrpa calculations . some results and srpa characteristics",
    "were compared with those from the schematic quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite which was successfully used for a long time in nuclear spectroscopy .",
    "it was found that the forces sv - bas and skm@xmath5 perform similarly in the description of @xmath4 states for light rare - earth nuclei but deviate in heavier nuclei .",
    "the latter is mainly explained by the fact that skm@xmath5 delivers a weaker pairing gap and thus lower 2qp energies , than sv - bas .",
    "sv - bas delivers less fuzzy trends of energies and b(e2 ) values and well describes dy isotopes but fails in u isotopes .",
    "skm@xmath5 is better in u isotopes but its results fluctuate more with the mass number .",
    "moreover , sv - bas has an important advantage over skm@xmath5 : it well describes quadrupole equilibrium deformations and energy centroids of isgqr .",
    "thus sv - bas allows to get a consistent description of @xmath4 states and isgqr .",
    "in general our study shows that , despite all the progress , available fully or partly self - consistent qrpa schemes are still not accurate enough for a satisfactory description of @xmath4 states throughout medium and heavy axially deformed nuclei .",
    "this holds for both our results and previous ones @xcite .",
    "some essential factors should be still added or improved .",
    "the proper calculation scheme should fulfill at least the following requirements : a ) accurate description of the s - p spectra and equilibrium deformation , b ) treatment of pairing ( bcs or hfb ) with pbe , c ) self - consistent residual qrpa interaction with both ph- and pp - channels and consistently incorporated pbe , d ) simultaneous description of other quadrupole excitations ( isgqr ) , e ) systematic description involving nuclei from various mass regions and domains with a low and high collectivity , f ) the coupling to complex configuration ( with the proper inclusion of the pauli principle ) .",

    "\\iii ) if the pole strengths are equal ( @xmath208 ) , then @xmath209 and @xmath210 supposing that @xmath211 , we get @xmath212 , \\\\ e^2_+&\\approx & \\epsilon^2_1-\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa f^2 , \\;\\;\\ ; e^2_- \\approx   \\epsilon^2_2 -\\frac{3}{2}\\kappa f^2 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this simple model indicates that collectivity ( collective shift @xmath213 ) of the first rpa state is determined to a large extent by the relative strength of the first pole .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by our numerical results , see discussion of table [ tab : poles ] .",
    "thus we have found a simple way for the prediction of the collectivity ( weak or large ) of the first rpa state . in practice",
    ", it is enough to compare the matrix elements of the first and next poles . or , which is even easier , one should check if the first pole fulfills the @xmath134=0 nilsson selection rule .",
    "since srpa deals with a separable residual interaction , this method can be directly compared with the schematic separable qrpa exploited in qpm @xcite .",
    "the qpm is not self - consistent : it uses the woods - saxon s - p basis and its isoscalar @xmath214 and isovector @xmath215 strength constants of the residual interaction are adjusted to reproduce the experimental energies of lowest vibrational states and giant resonances .",
    "however , just because of the successful combination of the microscopic and phenomenological aspects , the qpm is known to be quite accurate in description of low - energy states .",
    "thus it is instructive to compare the characteristics of self - consistent models , like skyrme qrpa , with the relevant qpm parameters .    in this connection ,",
    "let s briefly discuss the qpm strength constants of the residual interaction and compare them with the srpa ones .",
    "the strength constants in the proton - neutron domain ( nn , pp , np ) can be related to their counterparts in the isoscalar - isovector domain ( 00,11 , 01 ) as @xmath216 the constants @xmath217 represent the mixing between isoscalar ( 00 ) and isovector ( 11 ) excitations .",
    "this mixing can be motivated by both physical ( coulomb interaction , etc ) and technical ( different sizes of neutron and proton s - p basis , etc ) reasons .",
    "since nuclei roughly keep the isospin symmetry , then @xmath218 if to assume @xmath219 and @xmath220 , then we get @xmath221 and the familiar qpm relations @xcite @xmath222 > from ( [ eq : kappa_00_11 ] ) one gets @xmath223 where @xmath224 with @xmath225 .",
    "usually @xmath226=-1.5 is used @xcite , which results in a dominance of the np - interaction , @xmath227=-2.5 with @xmath228 and @xmath229 .    for the comparison ,",
    "the self - consistent srpa calculations give somewhat different picture . as a relevant example",
    ", the strength constants @xmath230 for the dominant first input operator @xmath231 in @xmath232dy are considered .",
    "note that in srpa the relation @xmath233 is kept .",
    "sv - bas10 gives strength constants @xmath234 with the relations @xmath235=2.7 , @xmath227=7.7 and @xmath236=2.9 .",
    "similar results are obtained in other nuclei .",
    "skm@xmath5 gives @xmath237 , @xmath238 and relations @xmath235=-2.0 , @xmath239 , and @xmath236= 2.2 .",
    "in agreement with qpm , both forces provide a dominant np - interaction with the proper sign .",
    "however , in contrast to ( [ knn = kpp ] ) , the weak srpa constants @xmath240 and @xmath241 noticeably deviate from each other , which might be a signature of an large mixing of the isoscalar and isovector interaction . perhaps just this mixing , if not be properly balanced with other parts of the interaction , partly leads to the troubles of skyrme qrpa with the description of @xmath4 states .",
    "a difference in sign of sv - bas and skm@xmath5 constants @xmath240 should be also mentioned as demonstration of the noticeable dependence of the residual interaction on the skyrme force .",
