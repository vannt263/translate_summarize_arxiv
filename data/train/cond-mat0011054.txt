    "in recent years one of the significant advances in the research of high - t@xmath3 superconductors is the detailed experiments on the pseudogap behavior in underdoped high - t@xmath3 superconductors .",
    "the pseudogap phenomena have been recognized as one of the most important issues .",
    "there are enormous studies from both experimental and theoretical point of view .",
    "influence of the pseudogap formation shows up in different experimental probes , such as nmr relaxation time , knight shift , neutron scattering , tunneling , photoemission , specific heat , optical conductivity and d.c .",
    "resistivity@xcite .",
    "the pseudogap phenomena means the suppression of the low frequency spectral weight without any long range order . for cuprate superconductors",
    "the low frequency spectral weight begins to be strongly suppressed below some characteristic temperature t@xmath4 much higher than t@xmath3 .",
    "typically t@xmath4 is several times larger that t@xmath3 in underdoped cuprates and their doping dependence is qualitatively different . while t@xmath3 deceases with underdoping , t@xmath4 increases in contrast .",
    "this suggest that t@xmath4 does not follow the real t@xmath3 line but instead some kind of mean - field critical temperature t@xmath5 .    in reality the origin of pairing interaction should be considered to be the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations .",
    "there are studies dealing with pairing correlations obtained by the spin fluctuations on the basis of the fluctuation - exchange ( flex ) approximation @xcite .",
    "to explain the pseudogap phenomena many theories have been proposed , such as the argument based on bcs - be cross - over @xcite , spin - charge separation induced by stripe order @xcite , rvb theory @xcite , strong superconducting phase fluctuations @xcite , magnetic scenario near the antiferromagnetic instability @xcite and formation of charge density waves ( cdw ) or spin density waves ( sdw ) @xcite .",
    "a feature of the last scenario is that the pseudogap can persist in the superconducting state @xcite .",
    "the effect of the magnetic field on the pseudogap in high - t@xmath3 cuprates has been theoretically investigated by yanase et.al .",
    "@xcite considering the landau quantization for the superconducting fluctuations as the main effect of the magnetic field .",
    "the pseudogap phenomena was studied in the context of non - fermi anderson model in @xcite considering the electron - fluctuation interaction .",
    "recent dimensional crossover study by preosti et.al .",
    "@xcite shows that the pseudogap effect is basically absent in three dimensions .    in this paper",
    "we describe the pairing scenario based on the strong coupling superconductivity .",
    "generally the strong coupling superconductivity indicates the existence of the incoherent cooper pairs as the nozieres and schmitt - rink formalism @xcite .",
    "we think of the pseudogap as the phenomena brought about by the strong superconducting fluctuations .",
    "maly et.al . @xcite",
    "have introduced the idea of  resonances  which means the scattering mechanism by the presence of metastable preformed pairs .    through several years of extensive experimental work general consensus regarding",
    "the superconducting gap symmetry seems to be reach , that the superconducting gap has mainly @xmath6-wave character with possibility of a small mixture of other angular momentum state @xcite .",
    "a remarkable point of the pseudogap is that its structure in momentum space is the same as the superconducting @xmath7 symmetry with continuous evolution through t@xmath3 .",
    "this implies that the pseudogap phenomena has close connection to the superconducting fluctuations @xcite . on the other hand using intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy , krasnov et.al .",
    "@xcite found that the pseudogap is coexisting with the superconducting gap which imply that the two phenomena are different in nature .",
    "the precursor superconductivity scenario can not explain these experimental data and a possible explication might be the formation of cdw or sdw @xcite .",
    "another striking characteristic of cuprate superconductors is the anisotropy of their structure .",
    "the quantity which most evidently displays the anisotropy of a particular material is the optical conductivity @xmath8 and the corresponding d.c .",
    "resistivity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the opening of the pseudogap has drastic effect on the physical properties of the high - t@xmath3 cuprates @xcite .",
    "it is found that associated with the pseudogap the in - plane resistivity deviates from the @xmath10-linear behavior @xcite and the t coefficient of the @xmath1-axis resistivity changes sign , showing semiconducting behavior at low temperature @xcite .",
    "this paper is constructed as follow . in section 2",
    "we give the model hamiltonian and explain the theoretical framework . in section 3 we present the results obtained for the spectral function @xmath11 and the results for the transport properties studied in this paper . in section 4",
    "we summarize the obtained results and give conclusions .",
    "in this section we describe the theoretical framework of this paper .",
    "we consider a microscopic model which incorporates both strong electron - fluctuation interaction in the @xmath12 planes and a weak interlayer coupling . within each layer",
    "we consider the following two - dimensional model hamiltonian which has @xmath7-wave superconducting ground state : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the annihilation operator for an electron with momentum @xmath15 and spin @xmath16 in the layer @xmath17 .",
    "the electron dispersion relation is expressed as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the nearest and next - nearest neighbors hopping amplitudes and @xmath21 is the chemical potential . from now on we will consider @xmath19 equal to unity and @xmath22 . the pair interaction is written as : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the @xmath7-wave form factor . in the previous relation",
    "v is negative .",
    "the hopping between layers is included in : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hopping amplitude between layers and @xmath27 is the annihilation operator for an electron within the planar site @xmath28 , with spin @xmath16 in the layer @xmath17 .",
    "the important character of high - t@xmath3 cuprates is the momentum dependence of the interlayer hopping matrix element @xmath29 .",
    "the band calculations @xcite of these materials have shown that the c - axis tunneling matrix element is larger at @xmath30 and symmetry related points .",
    "the functional form is : @xmath31 on the other side the coupling between layers has little effect on the pseudogap @xcite .",
    "the out of plane resistance is determined mainly by the properties of individuals @xmath12 layers .",
    "the large magnitude of the resistivity anisotropy reflects that the @xmath1-axis mean free path is shorter than the interlayer distance , and the carriers are tightly confined to the @xmath12 planes and also is the evidence of the incoherent charge dynamics in the @xmath1-axis direction .    the interlayer part of the hamiltonian ( [ 5 ] )",
    "will be considered for the calculation of @xmath1-axis charge dynamics and @xmath32 .      in this paper",

    "we also calculated the critical temperature in the first order of perturbation theory and found that in the limit of strong coupling the self - consistent calculation of @xmath76 reach the limit of first order calculation of @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath75 can be viewed as the bcs critical temperature .",
    "the phase diagram corresponds to the underdoped region with the hole concentration @xmath77 . roughly speaking",
    "the pseudogap phenomena occurs in the region between t@xmath3 and t@xmath5 .",
    "this region is extremely wide in the strong coupling case . as we can see from the shape of spectral function @xmath54 the main effect of the electron - fluctuation interaction is the change of shape of @xmath54 which is seen near @xmath78 .",
    "this suggests that the electron - fluctuation interaction shifts the fermi surface to the place far from @xmath78 .",
    "similar with other reported self - consistent treatments of the t - matrix @xcite the pseudogap is not seen clearly in the integrated density of states but only in the @xmath15-dependent spectral function at extreme parameters ranges . in fig .",

    "6b the temperature dependence of the density of states for fixed coupling strength @xmath80 . as we can see from fig .",
    "6a , increasing the coupling strength , the density of states near @xmath73 slowly decreases but the central peak still remain .",
    "the central peak is due to the integration over the direction @xmath81 in the spectral function where no pseudogap appears .",
    "for the same temperature the central peak remain at the same frequency @xmath82 .",
    "decreasing the temperature the central peak start to shifts to lower frequencies and a hump start to appear in the density of states .",
    "the two humps appearing in fig .",
    "6a are due to the pseudogap formation in the spectral function near the @xmath83 and symmetry related points and their intensity increase with lowering the temperature .",
    "we have calculated the in - plane and @xmath1-axis optical conductivity using eqs .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "we also have calculated the resistivity as function of temperature for both in - plane and @xmath1-axis direction .",
    "our approximation assumes the independent electron propagation in each layer and is justified for small interlayer hopping .",

    "resistivity was calculated within @xmath84 model in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "7 we present the obtained results for the in - plane conductivity as function of frequency for two temperatures . the in - plane spectrum of @xmath85 is dominated by drude peak at @xmath73 .",
    "the intensity of the peak grows by increasing the temperature .",
    "8 we present the @xmath1-axis optical conductivity for three temperatures at the doping level @xmath77 .",
    "the electronic contribution to @xmath86 in the normal state of the underdoped cuprates is nearly @xmath87 independent and does nor form a drude peak at @xmath73 , indicating incoherent nature of the charge dynamics along the @xmath1-axis @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasize that the pseudogap appears only in @xmath86 .",
    "actually the development of the pseudogap in @xmath86 is correlated with a rapid narrowing of drude width in @xmath86 .",
    "we observe an anomalous broad peak in @xmath86 at finite frequencies which grows in intensity as the temperature is lowered with no discontinuity at the superconducting transition similar to the experimental results @xcite . in fig .",
    "9 we present the temperature dependence of the in - plane resistivity @xmath88 .",
    "we found a linear behavior for the in - plane resistivity at high temperature and a deviation from linearity below a characteristic temperature @xmath89 @xmath90 may be defined by different methods @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the temperature @xmath90 the characteristic temperature where the resistivity present a downturn , with a linear behavior above it .",
    "the arrows in fig . 9 indicate @xmath90 . increasing the doping concentration @xmath47 , @xmath90 decrease .    in fig .",
    "10 we present the @xmath1-axis resistivity .",
    "we found in this case the same linear behavior of resistivity as function of temperatures , at high temperatures and a upturn at lower temperatures @xmath91 signaling a semiconductor -like behavior .",
    "the semiconducting @xmath10 dependence of the @xmath1-axis resistivity is associated with the deepening of the pseudogap .",
    "therefore the contribution to the conductivity from the quasiparticles near the @xmath30 is suppressed by the pseudogap .",
    "the in - plane conductivity is determined by the contributions from  cold - spots  and the pseudogap is not important for the in - plane conductivity , but has more effect on the @xmath1-axis conductivity .",
    "the @xmath1-axis conductivity is determined from the contributions from the  hot - spots  where the pseudogap is large .",
    "therefore the @xmath1-axis conductivity is remarkably suppressed by the pseudogap .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental results for cuprates @xcite .",
    "our results are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental results obtained for @xmath92 where with @xmath93 doping the number of holes in @xmath94 planes increases @xcite , where @xmath95 stands for @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",

    "thermopower has become a simple and ideal probe for the studies of high @xmath76 superconductors .",
    "the thermopower is one of the several physical quantities which distinctly reveals the unusual normal state properties .",
    "the results obtained for the thermopower are calculated using eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "the thermopower of cuprates @xcite has the propriety that is not a monotonic function of temperature .",
    "several authors have tried to explain the temperature behavior of thermopower in term of phonon drag , metallic diffusion , semiconducting model and others @xcite , but they can not explain the linear behavior at high temperature @xcite without considering the cylindrical fermi surface @xcite .    in fig .",
    "11 we present the temperature dependence of the thermopower .",
    "it can be seen that the normal state thermopower decrease with increasing hole doping @xmath98 to a lower positive value , at a fixed temperature .",
    "the temperature dependence of thermopower is linear with a negative slope at high temperature and present a broad peak , shifted toward the low - temperature as the doping increase @xcite .",
    "the hump of thermopower in the normal state was reported as a kind of universal behavior of @xmath99 , corelated with the opening of the pseudogap in the normal state of a superconductor @xcite .    in fig .",
    "12 we present the doping dependence of the thermopower at the interaction strength @xmath100 and at the temperature @xmath101 . at a fixed temperature much larger than the critical temperature , @xmath102 continuously decreases from underdoped to overdoped regions , changing its sign near optimal doping .",
    "the theoretical work presented in @xcite shows that the doping dependence of the thermopower can be explained by the common band dispersion relation of high - t@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "therefore the thermopower can be a criterium for measuring the hole doping in @xmath12 layers @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the d - wave pairing scenario , based on the strong coupling superconductivity well explains some of the physical properties of the layered cuprates above the critical temperature @xmath74 .",
    "we have considered that the strong coupling superconductivity takes place in underdoped cuprates and the pseudogap phenomena are its precursor .",
    "we considered the t - matrix approximation which is the dominant scattering vertex in the vicinity of the superconducting critical point . in this analysis",
    "we did nt considered the vertex corrections .",
    "anyway our theory appropriately explains the pseudogap phenomena in high - t@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "we did not take care into account the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations which are important for explaining other properties of cuprates such as the nmr spin lattice relaxation @xmath103 .",
    "based on this scenario we studied charge dynamics , in - plane and @xmath1-axis resistivity and thermopower and compared the results with the experimental results . as can be seen from previous section our theory fit well the experimental results from @xmath104 class of layered superconductors . for the calculation of in - plane charge dynamics we obtained a spectrum dominated by a drude term , while for @xmath1-axis dynamics we found an almost frequency independent behavior . for the @xmath1-axis resistivity we found , due to the opening of the pseudogap in the density of states , a semiconductor - like behavior .",
    "for the temperature dependence of thermopower we found a linearly dependence at high temperatures with a negative slope .",
