    "a _ quadratic _ dependence on the ionic charge of the electrostatic free energy of solvation of a simple ion in aqueous solution is about the simplest reasonable possibility for that behavior .",
    "the born model predicts that quadratic dependence.@xcite several computer simulation calculations have shown that it is approximately correct for the simplest monovalent ions in water.@xcite theoretical simplifications have been advanced to take advantage of such behavior.@xcite    if that quadratic behavior were correct with sufficient accuracy , it would indeed permit important simplifications of the difficult task of molecular calculations of solvation free energies owing to electrostatic interactions in complex solutions .",
    "the theoretical simplifications identified on that basis can be viewed either as perturbation theory through second order in the electrostatic interactions , or as a gaussian modeling of certain thermal fluctuations of those interactions .",
    "adopting either view , these methods would have wide applicability and great simplicity .",
    "the question of the accuracy of the quadratic dependence on charge of the free energy owing to electrostatic interactions deserves to be raised for its own sake and given a precise answer as general as possible .",
    "this quadratic behavior is not a universal truth and previous simulation calculations have given helpful information on the circumstances where this quadratic dependence can be expected to fail.@xcite however , previous simulation calculations are sufficiently disparate that a high precision answer to the question of the accuracy of second - order perturbation theory for the free energy owing to electrostatic interactions is not available .",
    "the disparate character of the available simulation results is largely caused by a lack of uniformity with respect to the treatment of finite - system - size effects on electrostatic interactions in aqueous solutions .",
    "it is not atypical for a finite - system - size correction and the electrostatic solvation free energy to be of similar size .",
    "in contrast to the role of computer experiments in answering this question , laboratory experiments have been useful mostly for framing the question.@xcite the difficulty of using laboratory experiments for the present purpose resides in our inability to extract generally an electrostatic contribution from contributions of the other interactions present .",
    "because of these points , this work calculates the free energy owing to electrostatic interactions of simple , spherical ions in water by monte carlo methods and gives particular attention to the methodological issue of correction for finite system size .",
    "the molecular models used are simple but they have been widely tested . because the goal of this work is to address the question of quadratic dependence on charge of the electrostatic solvation free energy , these models are sufficiently realistic for the present purposes .",
    "however , we will compare our computed free energies with experimental results and thus provide information on how these models might be simply improved for prediction of electrostatic free energies .    before proceeding with the technical developments it is worthwhile to give some discussion of the idea for the present treatment of system - size effects on solvation free energies of ions .",
    "there is no generally valid recipe that allows a determination of the effects of a finite system size on the calculated physical quantity in computer simulations .",
    "what must generally be done is to analyze the observed size dependence empirically . if , as is the case for coulomb interactions of long range , different procedures are available , then we should expect consistent thermodynamic limiting ( @xmath3 ) results for different methods of treating the finite - size system .",
    "it is well understood that certain quantities involving integrals over the whole sample , such as the dipole - moment fluctuations , depend intrinsically on exterior conditions or constraints.@xcite those conditions must then be properly understood theoretically .    for the present problem involving the interactions and associated thermodynamics of an ion immersed in a dielectric liquid , a reasonable view is the following : treatment of electrostatic interactions in a truly periodic format , _",
    "e.g. _ , by ewald procedures , is consistent with the periodic boundary conditions that are nearly inevitable for other reasons .",
    "in periodic boundary conditions the interactions at the longest range that _ must _ be taken seriously occur at an appreciable fraction of the distance to the surface of the simulation cell . for typical simulated system sizes , ionic interactions at that longest range",
    "are large .",
    "treatment of electrostatic interactions in a truly periodic format thoroughly tempers those large interactions . but a mathematical price for true periodicity of electrostatic interactions is a `` self - interaction '' associated with interactions with images and a uniform neutralizing charge background . for neutral systems this self - interaction can be sometimes ignored . for non - neutral systems such as those studied here",
    "there may be practical advantages of consistency obtained for explicit consideration of the self - interaction .",
    "we will account for these self - interactions explicitly in the calculations below .",
    "this argument permits treatments of the ionic interactions other than ewald summation .",
    "in fact , the work below tests a generalized reaction - field ( grf ) method and also finds that consistent results can be obtained if self - interactions are treated on a similar basis .",
    "the various methods to compute free energies using computer simulations have been reviewed extensively.@xcite we start here from the potential distribution theorem for the excess chemical potential @xmath4,@xcite @xmath5\\right\\ } } \\right\\rangle_{q_0}~ , \\label{eq : df}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the two charge states and @xmath8 ; @xmath9 denotes a thermal configuration - space average in the charge - state @xmath10 ; and @xmath11 is the configuration - dependent interaction energy of the ion in charge - state @xmath10 with the solution .",
    "apart from finite - size corrections to be discussed later , @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electrostatic potential at the charge position @xmath14 .",
    "we next analyze eq  [ eq : df ] utilizing a cumulant expansion@xcite with respect to @xmath15 , @xmath16~ , \\label{eq : dfc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 .",
    "this defines the cumulants @xmath18 of order @xmath19 as    @xmath20    we can interpret eq  [ eq : dfc ] as a taylor expansion in @xmath21 if we set @xmath22 , where @xmath23 accounts for finite - size effects as a `` self - interaction '' to be discussed further below , @xmath24+\\cdots~ , \\label{eq : dmuc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 .",
    "the mean and the fluctuation of the electrostatic potential at the charge site @xmath10 ( corrected for finite - size effects ) yield the derivatives of the free energy with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the information about the derivatives can therefore be extracted from equilibrium simulations . in principle , higher - order cumulants could be used to obtain information about the other taylor coefficients . however , as was observed by smith and van gunsteren,@xcite higher - order cumulants are increasingly difficult to extract from computer simulations of limited duration",
    ".    therefore , we will evaluate @xmath27 and @xmath28 at few discrete charge states and combine this information about the derivatives , either by constructing an interpolating polynomial or by using a @xmath29 fit to a polynomial expression ( or any other functional form ) for the free energy as a function of @xmath26 .",

    "eq  [ eq : ewaldtot ] can also be used for a non - neutral system since charges are implicitly compensated by a homogeneous background in the ewald formulation .",

    "this is done by adding a constant @xmath74 to the bare coulomb potential,@xcite @xmath75 this corresponds to enforcing eq  [ eq : phinorm ] and adding a self term @xmath76 $ ] for the minimum - image interaction .",

    "monte carlo simulations using @xmath101 water molecules were carried out for charges 0 , @xmath104 , and @xmath167 to calculate the mean @xmath116 and the fluctuation @xmath117 of the electrostatic potential @xmath108 at the ion site . as in the previous calculations ,",

    "the positively charged hydrogen atom can penetrate the lj shell of the ions without a direct energetic penalty .",
    "the interaction with the negative point charge at the center of the ion strongly binds the water molecule , resulting in a large enthalpic contribution to the free energy of hydration .",
    "but also effects of non - additive interactions might play a considerable role.@xcite    also included in table  [ tab : fhyd ] are computer simulation results by straatsma and berendsen.@xcite these authors used thermodynamic integration in conjunction with isothermal - isobaric molecular dynamics simulations to compute hydration free energies of ions .",
    "the interaction potentials used here are identical with those of straatsma and berendsen , except for the treatment of the electrostatic interactions .",
    "we used ewald summation ; whereas straatsma and berendsen used a spherical cutoff and a born - type correction for finite - size effects .",

    "the quantitative agreement is however poor .",
    "our values for the cations na@xmath79 and k@xmath79 are closer to the experimental data of marcus . the cation free energies of straatsma and berendsen ( with born correction ) are consistently more negative than those of our calculations . on the other hand , our anion free energies",
    "are significantly more negative than those of straatsma and berendsen as well as of migliore _",
    "_  the results of straatsma and berendsen for cl@xmath81 and br@xmath81 are somewhat closer to the experimental data of marcus when the born correction is included . without the correction",
    "they are significantly too high .",
    "the most pronounced discrepancies between the anion data of straatsma and berendsen@xcite and ours are those of the fluoride ion , with our @xmath4 values being lower by 83  kj  mol@xmath115 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising since straatsma and berendsen used the same parameters for the water - water and water - ion interactions .",
    "the difference can be a consequence of using different ensembles ( nvt versus quasi - npt ) ; or , more likely , it is caused by the different treatment of the electrostatic interactions ( ewald versus spherical cutoff ) .",
    "the fluoride ion also shows the largest relative deviations from the experimental results . to further investigate these discrepancies ,",
    "we have studied the energetics of clusters of different size formed by a single fluoride ion and water .",
    "we have performed monte carlo simulations using one f@xmath81 ion that nucleates @xmath198 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 water molecules at 298  k , as described in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "we calculated the interaction energy @xmath199 of the fluoride ion with the spc water molecules over 50000 passes .",
    "figure  [ fig : clust ] shows the differences @xmath200 with respect to the bulk simulation using @xmath101 water molecules and ewald summation as a function of @xmath201 .",
    "@xmath202 can be fitted to a third - order polynomial in @xmath201 over the whole range of system sizes .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath3 yields a limit for @xmath202 close to zero .",
    "( however , the nontrivial dependence on @xmath201 limits the accuracy of the extrapolation . )",
    "the result obtained from ewald summation , @xmath203  kj  mol@xmath115 , also agrees with the value @xmath204  kj  mol@xmath115 obtained from integrating the pair correlation functions of the bulk simulation using @xmath130 in eq  [ eq : gint ] , adding the lj contributions , and applying the finite - size correction @xmath205 .",
    "the integration shows that the lj contributions are strongly repulsive ( @xmath206kj  mol@xmath115 ) but compensated by large electrostatic interactions .    the value for the solvation energy reported by straatsma and berendsen",
    ", @xmath207  kj  mol@xmath115 , is however considerably smaller .",
    "the observed differences in @xmath199 of about 150  kj  mol@xmath115 agree in magnitude and sign with those of the free energies ( 83  kj  mol@xmath115 ) .",
    "if we truncate the integration of @xmath100 weighted with the pair correlation functions obtained from ewald summation at @xmath208  nm ( which is the cutoff straatsma and berendsen used ) and do not apply a finite - size correction , we obtain a value of @xmath209  kj  mol@xmath115 in much closer agreement with straatsma and berendsen s .",
    "this indeed indicates that the treatment of the electrostatic interactions ( ewald summation versus spherical cutoff ) is the major source of the discrepancy .",
    "also included in figure  [ fig : clust ] are the results for the mean and the variance of the electrostatic potential at the ion site .",
    "figure  [ fig : clust ] shows differences with respect to the bulk value .",
    "the differences of the mean values @xmath210 closely follow the solvation - energy differences @xmath202 and can also be fitted to a third - order polynomial in @xmath201 .",
    "the differences of the fluctuation @xmath211 depend linearly on @xmath201 for @xmath78 between 8 and 256 .",
    "both fitted curves extrapolate to approximately 0 , indicating that the calculated bulk values are the correct limits for @xmath3 .    from the cluster - size dependence of the solvation energy and the mean and variance of the electrostatic potential , as well as the results for me and na@xmath79 , we conclude that the use of periodic boundary conditions in conjunction with ewald - summation ( or reaction - field ) electrostatics closely approximates the correct bulk behavior of the system ; however , to get correct energetics it is important to include the self - interactions in the coulomb energy .",
    "we have shown that free energies can be accurately calculated from equilibrium simulations by extracting derivative information with respect to a coupling parameter .",
    "we have studied the free energy of charging ions in water , which accounts for most of the free energy of ionic solvation for typical ion sizes . the choice of the ionic charge as coupling parameter results in free - energy expressions involving cumulants of the electrostatic potential @xmath108 at the charge sites .",
    "we find that the statistics of @xmath108 are approximately gaussian .",
    "this means that only the first and second moment of the distribution can be calculated accurately , with higher moments dominated by the poorly sampled tails .",
    "correspondingly , only information about the first and second derivative of the free energy can be calculated accurately for any given charge state .",
    "the information for different charge states ( _ e.g. _ , uncharged and fully charged ) can then be combined using interpolation or polynomial fitting .",
    "we have studied a methane - like lennard - jones particle in spc water .",
    "we observe two almost gaussian regimes separated by @xmath148 with different characteristics .",
    "negative ions are more stably solvated compared to positive ions of equal size , in agreement with the experimental data.@xcite the system shows further asymmetry , since the average electrostatic potential at the position of the uncharged particle is positive .",
    "this means that increasing the ion charge first costs energy .",
    "we relate these asymmetries of the energetics ( lower free energy of negative ions , positive potential ) to the structural asymmetry of the water molecule .",
    "the hydrogen atoms can penetrate the ionic van der waals shell , whereas the oxygen atom is better protected . for the uncharged particle , this results in a net positive potential ; and",
    "the point charge at the center of negative ions exerts strong electrostatic interactions with the tightly bound hydrogen of water .",
    "however , particularly for small anions this effect might by exaggerated by the interaction potentials used",
    ". this potential model does not give a protective van der waals sphere to the charge on the hydrogen atom .",
    "in principle , this is a fundamental difficulty , but in computer simulations , the heights of energetic barriers usually exclude the singularity .",
    "the development of interaction potentials for anion - water interactions nevertheless has to account for these problems .",
    "the strong interactions with the hydrogens `` pull '' the water closer and the first maxima of the ion - oxygen pair correlation function is already in the strongly repulsive region , reducing the effective ion radius .",
    "we have also studied the charging of sodium , potassium , calcium , fluoride , chloride , and bromide ions .",
    "the agreement with the available experimental data for solvation free energies is only qualitative , reproducing the trends with ionic size .",
    "the quantitative data are not in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results , even conceding quite substantial discrepancies between different compilations of the experimental data for certain ions .",
    "we observe typical errors of about 10 to 15 percent for the free energies of ionic solvation compared to the experimental data of marcus.@xcite this clearly indicates the further need to develop quantitatively reliable descriptions of ion - water interactions .",
    "however , to allow for valid comparisons of data obtained from computer simulations with experimental results , it is crucial to eliminate systematic errors in the simulation methods .",
    "an important part of this study was devoted to analyzing the effect of finite system sizes on the free energy of charging .",
    "we could clearly establish that ewald summation ( and , similarly , the generalized reaction - field method ) accounts for finite - size effects by adding a term that corrects for self - interactions .",
    "we showed that even for systems with only @xmath170 water molecules it is possible to obtain accurate estimates of the solvation free energy of the sodium ion . for typical system sizes of a few hundred water molecules ,",
