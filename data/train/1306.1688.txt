    "sliding friction has been a broadly - studied field due to its huge practical relevance as well as its theoretical challenges @xcite .",
    "the regime of validity and the microscopic origin of the amontons - coulomb empirical laws of static and dynamic friction have still open issues @xcite .",
    "the advancements of technology in the last few decades has triggered both theoretical @xcite as well as experimental @xcite investigations in this field .",
    "a broad range of investigations focuses on a simple fundamental model for microscopic tribological system : the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite and its extensions @xcite .",
    "its standard 1d version consists of a chain of harmonically interacting atoms subject to one periodic sinusoidal potential , thereby representing a discretized elastic overlayer deposited on a corrugated surface .",
    "the application of a constant force to the chain allows us to determine a depinning threshold , representative of static friction . for an irrational ratio between the natural atomic spacing and the period of the substrate potential ( incommensurate interface ) , the fk model undergoes a phase transition , called aubry transition , where the ground state `` hull function '' exhibits analyticity breaking @xcite .",
    "when , for a fixed interparticle chain stiffness , the amplitude of the sinusoidal potential is smaller than a certain critical value , the static frictional force vanishes , leading to the onset of free sliding or `` superlubricity '' ; otherwise the chain is pinned until a finite threshold force is overcome .",
    "superlubricity connected with incommensurability is one of the pervasive concepts of modern tribology with a wide area of relevant practical applications as well as fundamental theoretical issues @xcite .",
    "the role of incommensurability has been recently extended @xcite in the framework of a driven 1d confined model inspired by the tribological problem of two sliding interfaces with a thin lubricant layer in between .",
    "the moving interface is thus characterized by three inherent length scales : the periods of the bottom and top substrates , and the period of the embedded solid lubricant structure . in particular , in the presence of a uniform external driving of the top substrate , the interplay between these incommensurate length scales can give rise to intriguing dynamical phase - locking phenomena and surprising velocity `` quantization '' effects , due to the dragging of topological solitons ( `` kinks '' and `` antikinks '' ) , i.e. , nonlinear localized density superstructures arising from geometrical lattice mismatch @xcite .",
    "these results are suggestive but remain rather idealized in several respects .",
    "in particular , the profile of the corrugation potential energy experienced by a lubricant atom interacting with real physical surfaces is likely to deviate considerably from the sinusoids of the two - substrate confined tribological model .",
    "it is therefore useful to investigate what influence the shape of the substrate corrugation may have on the frictional dynamics . in this paper we model the corrugation of the two confining substrates via the remoissenet - peyrard ( rp ) function @xcite",
    ", whose shape can be varied continuously as a function of a parameter .",
    "the rp potential , which retrieves the sine - gordon shape as a special case , has been employed widely and successfully to model the dynamics of atoms adsorbed on crystal surfaces in realistic situations @xcite .",

    "[ model : fig ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 are the wave - vector periodicities associated to the upper ( @xmath16 ) and lower ( @xmath17 ) substrates , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 denote their sliding velocities respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is a viscous - friction damping which takes into account various sources of dissipation in the substrates ( phonons , electronic excitations , etc . ) , which are not explicitly included in the model .",
    "we select a relatively small dissipation constant @xmath21 , producing an underdamped regime . as done in previous work @xcite to simulate an infinite system , periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are applied , implementing , e.g.  via a continued fraction expansion technique @xcite , suitable rational approximations of the system",
    "periodicities @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , mimicking the desired incommensurability .",
    "as found in earlier studies , the general behavior of this model depends crucially on the relative commensurability of the substrates and the chain ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "to make a comparison with previous work in the sine - gordon substrates , we consider here the corresponding ratios of length scales defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 are also expressed in terms of the number of lubricant particles @xmath29 and the numbers of periods @xmath30 of the top / bottom potential oscillations in eq .   within each simulation cell .",
    "for definiteness we take @xmath31 and @xmath32 so that the top substrate has the longest lattice spacing .",
    "we take @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the force @xmath35 as basic units for the model . in the following",
    "we express all physical quantities in terms of suitable combinations of @xmath22 , @xmath4 , @xmath36 .",
    "an adaptive fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm is used to integrate the equations of motion .",
    "we start off with the chain particles at equilibrium ( the local energy minimum obtained by relaxing the immobile ",
    "@xmath37  system from a chain at rest with uniform separation @xmath23 ) . without loss of generality",
    ", we select a reference frame such that the bottom substrate is at rest ( @xmath38 ) , and make the upper substrate slide at constant velocity @xmath39 . after an initial transient ,",
    "the system reaches a dynamical steady state characterized by regular or irregular fluctuations of the drift velocity of the chain particles around an average value , which we indicate by @xmath40 .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the effects , on the tribological behavior of the sliding interface , of ( _ i _ ) the shape of the substrates potentials , represented by the rp parameter @xmath1 , and ( _ ii _ ) the coverage @xmath41 of the upper substrate to the array of kinks or antikinks .",
    "since the mean distance between consecutive kink / antikinks is @xmath42 this coverage @xmath43 can be tuned by modifying @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ gm1:fig ] reports the time - averaged center - of - mass velocity @xmath40 of the chain ( normalized to the top driving velocity @xmath44 ) as a function of its stiffness @xmath5 , for three values of the deformation parameter @xmath1 . in this calculation",
    ", for the length ratios we take a rational approximant to the golden mean @xmath45 .",
    "we adopt @xmath46 , i.e.  as many solitons as oscillation periods of the top substrate , and this , due to eq .  , implies @xmath47 . for @xmath48 , @xmath28 happens to approximate @xmath49 as well . according to eq .",
    ", this choice for @xmath28 produces a coverage @xmath46 , i.e.  as many solitons as oscillation periods of the top substrate .",
    "the velocity of the sliding top substrate is set to a moderate @xmath50 .    within a broad range of stiffness values , the chain moves at the quantized velocity @xmath51 @xcite , with @xmath52 approximately @xmath53 for the adopted value of @xmath27 .",
    "for extremely soft harmonic interparticle couplings ( small chain stiffness @xmath5 ) and for @xmath54 or @xmath55 , the chain center of mass tends to move ahead at the full external velocity @xmath56 . in the opposite limit of a very stiff chain ( large @xmath5 )",
    ", it moves at the symmetric speed @xmath57 .",
    "this is expected in a situation where the chain - corrugation interaction become marginal , and the dominating term in eq .",
    "is the dissipative one , which is minimum when @xmath58 .    in the transitions between the plateau speed and the large-@xmath5 and small-@xmath5 regimes ,",
    "the chain average velocity @xmath40 is generally a nontrivial function of the chain stiffness @xmath5 .",
    "the effect of the shape of the corrugation potential is evident : for both positive and negative @xmath1 , the plateau shrinks in size at the soft - chain side ( small @xmath5 ) , while it tends to expand in the stiff - chain side ( large @xmath5 ) .",
    "while the large-@xmath5 expansion is the same for positive and negative @xmath1 , the small-@xmath5 shrinkage is far more dramatic for positive @xmath1 , i.e.  for broad shallow minima separated by narrow sharp maxima in the corrugation potential .",
    "such a behavior can be qualitatively understood by considering that the plateau mechanism has been interpreted in terms of solitons , formed by the mismatch of the chain periodicity to that of the more commensurate substrate ( here the bottom potential ) , being rigidly driven forward by the ( top ) advancing potential representing the other , more mismatched , sliding surface .",
    "as @xmath5 is decreased , kinks become more and more localized objects : the plateau ends when the peierls - nabarro barrier @xcite for a kink to move forward one lattice parameter approaches the single - particle activation energy to jump a corrugation potential barrier . when the two barriers coincide , no kink motion is granted any more , and the chain advances as a whole ( @xmath59 ) . for positive @xmath1 values , the possibility for the particles to arrange relatively uniformly over the rp substrate at a small energy cost yields poorly localized kink superstructures in the chain , rapidly becoming equivalent to non - interacting particles , which are easily dragged forward , and drag the whole chain along .",
    "this rapidly destroys the quantized velocity plateau .",
    "in contrast , the deep narrow wells for negative values of the shape parameter @xmath1 tend to compress the chain particles in sharper kink structures relatively more easily dragged along by the moving substrate , while leaving the other ( non - soliton ) particles still pinned in the other deep minima , and preserving the quantized motion down to softer @xmath5 .",
    "the potential deformation is beneficial in the rigid - chain regime because , for given corrugation amplitude @xmath12 , the maximum force ( the slope at the inflection point , see fig .  [ model : fig ] ) that the top potential can apply to the chain particles is larger for @xmath60 than for the harmonic chain @xmath61 .",
    "the dragging force acting on the kinks is proportionally larger , allowing dragging to extend to stiffer chains which come with broader and fainter kinks .    to obtain a microscopic view of the quantized phenomena ,",
    "we follow the motion of a particle of the chain and plot its velocity @xmath62 , aside with the cm velocity @xmath40 , as a function of time ( left panels of fig .",
    "[ cmft : fig ] ) .",
    "we compare the usual three values of the deformation parameter considered in simulations .",
    "we adopt relatively rigid stiffness @xmath63 ( @xmath61 ) or @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) selected to remain well inside the quantized plateau in all cases .",
    "the motion of a single particle is a periodic oscillation , representing the passage of a soliton across that specific particle .",
    "this period @xmath66 equals the distance @xmath67 between successive kinks divided by the speed @xmath56 at which they are dragged forward by the advancing top substrate : @xmath68 .",
    "of course , this period is independent of the deformation parameter of the substrates . a fourier analysis ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ cmft : fig ] ) reveals that indeed the single - particle motion is periodic , with the same period @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the fundamental harmonic peak frequency in the fourier spectrum of the present examples .",
    "however , the detailed motion induced by the deformed potential is clearly very different , characterized by a remarkably high harmonic contents , compared to the simple harmonic oscillation of the @xmath61 case . the @xmath71 potential requires a complicated `` dance '' of the individual atoms to accommodate the passage of a soliton .",
    "note also that the concerted oscillation of all particles in the chain makes its center of mass advance at an essentially constant speed ( dashed line ) @xmath72 within numerical error .    to characterize in greater detail the effect of the potential shape on the quantized motion",
    ", we investigate the upper and lower boundary of the quantized plateau , @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "these boundaries are obtained by a sequence of linked calculations carried out with increasing ( for @xmath73 ) or decreasing ( for @xmath74 ) @xmath5 in small steps , until the quantized plateau is abandoned .",
    "for example , the sequence of calculations of fig .",
    "[ gm1:fig ] shows that @xmath75 for @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ kmaxkmin : fig ] reports the dependency of @xmath74 and @xmath73 on the potential shape parameter @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath73 is a symmetric function of the shape parameter @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath74 curve is quite asymmetric . as already remarked above , at the soft - chain side positive @xmath1 is consistently detrimental to the plateau state , leading to a rapid ( approximately exponential ) increase of @xmath74 with @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , the negative-@xmath1 region has a range @xmath76 where the potential shape deformation is beneficial to the quantized plateau even for soft chains",
    ". a further decrease of @xmath1 to more negative values produces an increase of @xmath74 , but a slow one , such that the relative width @xmath77 of the plateau actually increases as @xmath1 decreases .",
    "the @xmath74 and @xmath73 curves delimit the quantized velocity plateau region in the space of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath5 . above this region",
    ", we find a stiff - chain region where the dynamics is dominated by the dissipative term in eq .  , and @xmath40 approaches rapidly @xmath57 , with the two sliders acting symmetrically on the chain .",
    "the soft - chain region below the @xmath74 exhibits occasional pinning to either the top or the bottom slider , or unpinned nonquantized nonperiodic orbits .",
    "the `` dynamical phase diagram '' of fig .",
    "[ kmaxkmin : fig ] is relevant for the specific adopted value of dissipation @xmath20 and of speed @xmath44 . a modification of these two parameters would indeed modify the shape of the diagram , while preserving its overall features .      when @xmath78 , i.e.  when lubricant particles are fewer than the minima in the static substrate ( @xmath79 ) , eq",
    ".   predicts that the lubricant velocity turns negative , i.e.  opposite to @xmath56 . this remarkable leftward motion , produced by rightward moving antikinks",
    "is indeed observed even for the deformed rp potential , as shown in the example of fig .",
    "[ ak1:fig ] .",
    "the resulting `` backward '' plateaus are not so wide as in the case of kink - assisted forward lubricant motion .",
    "this qualitative finding , quite likely to carry forward to experiment is due to the dissipation into the substrate represented by the last term in eq .   which tend to favor a positive `` symmetric '' speed @xmath80 , thus actively disturbing the @xmath81 quantized motion .",
    "like in the @xmath82 case , the plateau width and @xmath5 range depends quite sensitively on the deformation parameter @xmath1 . in particular positive @xmath1",
    "is also especially effective in disrupting the plateau , and indeed for very strong deformation @xmath83 the backward plateau disappears altogether , the top driving substrate being unable to grab and drag the antikink pattern in the confined chain .      the choices of @xmath28 adopted in the calculations of both figs .",
    "[ gm1:fig ] and [ ak1:fig ] produce coverage @xmath46 , i.e.  as many solitons ( or antisolitons ) as periodic oscillations of the top slider . as was pointed out @xcite ,",
    "such perfect matching is the most favorable for kinks ( or antikinks ) dragging , thus for the quantized sliding phenomenon .",
    "to investigate how releasing the @xmath46 matching condition affects the lubricant dynamics , we compare several calculations with the same @xmath27 but with different values of the coverage obtained by changing @xmath28 , i.e.  the top substrate lattice spacing @xmath24 .    to investigate the coverage dependency , we consider fixed @xmath84 and the following values of @xmath28 : @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 corresponding to kink coverage @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "the results of these calculations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ gm6:fig ] for three values of the shape parameter .",
    "it can be seen that , independently on the value of the deformation parameter @xmath1 , the kink coverage largely affects the plateau by reducing its width as soon as the full matching ( unit coverage ) is lost . in general , for the less commensurate the kink coverage @xmath91 the plateau is disrupted quite substantially .",
    "not surprising , for the commensurate @xmath92 this reduction is less significant .",
    "still , for @xmath92 only one kink out of two finds a top corrugation which drags it along : accordingly , a plateau shrinkage is observed nonetheless .",
    "we have carried out similar simulations for other commensurability ratios , e.g.  the value @xmath93 considered in sect .",
    "[ anti : sec ] .",
    "the conclusion is that the quantized plateau always shrinks , often to the point of disappearing , whenever @xmath94 .",
    "in this work , we study the effect of the potential shape on the dynamics of a sliding 2-substrate fk - type model . even though this deformation goes a modest step away from the idealized world of models in the direction of real friction , it provides some useful trends and general understanding . in particular",
    ", we establish that in the rigid - lubricant limit ( large @xmath5 ) the worst possible pinning scheme for the solitons is that granted by a sinusoidal corrugation .",
    "any kind of deformation is beneficial to the quantized state .",
    "this is quite remarkable also in view of the fact that this rigid - lubricant regime is relevant whenever the lubricant - lubricant in - plane forces dominate over the substrate corrugation , e.g.  for noble - gases layers driven over graphite or even over several metallic surfaces @xcite . on the opposite , soft - lubricant limit",
    "instead a sinusoidal surface corrugation tends to be optimal , although a pattern based on narrow ( but not too narrow wells may occasionally provide even more favorable conditions for the quantized lubricant state .",
    "the grabbing of kinks by the more rarefied top slider is best seen when the kink lattice is fully commensurate to the top .",
    "whenever this is not the case ( kink coverage deviating from unity ) the quantization phenomenon becomes less prominent .",
    "however , this observation is to be integrated by a further point . as illustrated in the upper and central panels of fig .",
    "[ gm6:fig ] , secondary plateaus can arise @xmath40 values different from those predicted by the quantized formula .",
    "for example , in the @xmath95 simulations producing the secondary plateau characterized by @xmath96 , individual particles do carry out regular periodic trajectories , like in the standard quantized state .",
    "these secondary plateaus , observed also for the purely sinusoidal corrugation @xcite , are likely to be due to resonances very much akin to shapiro steps @xcite , excited by the simultaneous action of the periodically oscillating force produced by the sliding substrate and the forward - dragging force produced by the dissipative term in eq .  .",
    "further investigation of such secondary plateaus can lead to better insight in their nature , and possibly find realistic configurations where they could arise , e.g.  in colloidal sliding @xcite .",
