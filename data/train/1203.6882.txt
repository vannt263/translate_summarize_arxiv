    "the semi - classical theory considers the back reaction of quantum fields in a classical geometric background .",
    "it began about forty years ago with de witt@xcite , and since then , its consequences and applications are still under research , see for example@xcite .",
    "different from the usual einstein - hilbert action , the one loop effective gravitational action surmounts to quadratic theories in curvature , see for example refs . , .",
    "it is the gravitational version of the heisenberg - euler electromagnetism .",
    "as it is well known , vacuum polarization introduces non linear corrections into maxwell electrodynamics , see schwinger@xcite , first obtained by heisenberg and euler@xcite .",
    "this quadratic gravity was studied in the pioneering works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "starobinsky idea was that the higher order terms describe a slowly decaying dark energy , i.e. to produce slow - roll inflation .",
    "it is of interest for example in the context of the final stages of evaporation of black holes , inflationary theories@xcite , in the approach to the singularity@xcite and also in a more theoretical context@xcite .",
    "the effective gravity was apparently first investigated by tomita @xcite for general bianchi @xmath1 spaces .",
    "they found that the presence of anisotropy contributes to the formation of the singularity . in ref .",
    "it is shown that the equations for the anisotropic part of the bianchi type i metric can be integrated for a general @xmath2 theory including the quadratic @xmath3 gravity .",
    "shows that a quadratic weyl theory is less stable than a quadratic riemann scalar @xmath4 .",
    "homogenous solutions in the context of quadratic gravity was also addressed by@xcite .",
    "schmidt@xcite does a very interesting review of higher order gravity theories in connection to cosmology .",
    "we have previously numerically investigated bianchi @xmath1 type solutions@xcite for the diagonal line element only . soon after this result we also investigated the stability of the this particular bianchi @xmath1 case@xcite , also for the diagonal line element .",
    "we must mention that the question of stability of the de sitter solution in quadratic gravity was previously addressed by @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for zero cosmological constant @xmath5 , minkowski geometry is structurally stable in the sense that there is a basin of attraction to minkowski solution . and for @xmath6 de sitter type geometry is structurally stable , also in the same sense .",
    "thus , soon after the planck era , the effective one loop quadratic gravity predicts for the very particular bianchi i models , that there is a basin of attraction to minkowski space for @xmath5 and a basin of attraction to de sitter space for @xmath7 , see@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to consider more general geometries than the ones considered in@xcite and@xcite , for instance with a non diagonal line element .",
    "bianchi @xmath1 is the anisotropic generalization of the euclidean @xmath8 friedmann  flat \" space .",
    "the time like vector is orthogonal to the group orbit , geodesic and with zero vorticity . for an excelent and recent review in bianchi cosmologies ,",
    "see ref . .",
    "for any spatially homogenous space - time , the dynamical equations of motion , of any metric theory , result in a non linear system of ordinary differential equations . for the particular quadratic gravity ,",
    "the ordinary differential equation is of degree @xmath9 .",
    "the initial conditions chosen are very near to exact solutions of the quadratic theory , and also only classical vacuum source is considered , which we believe is the best description soon after the planck era .",
    "the solutions are obtained numerically and they are understood asymptotically in a certain sense described in the text .",
    "it is shown that depending on the initial conditions and parameters , the de sitter solution , or minkowski solution , or a singularity type solution is obtained asymptotically .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section @xmath10 presents the field equations for the bianchi @xmath1 case , and also the newman - penrose coefficients . in sec @xmath11 ,",
    "three different initial conditions are analyzed : one that converges to de sitter space , one that converges to minkowski space , and one that converges to a singularity .",
    "we believe the index notation should be clear from the text .",
    "the field equations for the semiclassical theory , are obtained performing metric variations in the gravitational lagrangian @xmath12+\\mathcal{l}_{q } , \\label{acao}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the quantum part of lagrangian and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants . for",
    "the spatially homogenous space they are described by the tensor @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19    the counterterms @xmath4 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 in ( [ acao ] ) are precisely the ones necessary in order to obtain a finite vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor , see for example ref . .",
    "a theory without these counterterms is inconsistent from the point of view of the renormalization of the quantum field in @xmath13 .",
    "the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor is set to zero , which emphasizes the effects of a theory that should have been considered from the start .",
    "we are disregarding any classical contribution in this work .",
    "the finite contributions to the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor are known only for very particular situations , for example , split rank spaces , for which the heat kernel can be obtained exactly @xcite , then the point splitting method gives @xmath23 exactly .",
    "these solutions are known as self consistent , @xmath24 and there are very few cases , for example ref . . for",
    "another very interesting example of a self consistent anisotropic solution supported by vacuum polarization see ref . .",
    "as in any other metric theory , the covariant divergence of @xmath25 must be zero @xmath26 from @xmath27 it follows that if @xmath28 and @xmath29 initially , then they will remain zero for any time , and act as constraints on the initial conditions .",
    "consequently , these constraints are checked to test the accuracy of the numerical results , while @xmath30 represent the real dynamical equations of the problem ( see for example ref .",
    ", p. 165 ) .",
    "the homogeneous and anisotropic metric is supposed in the following way,@xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spatial part .",
    "the replacement of the above line element in ( [ eq field equation for semiclassical theory ] ) results in a non - linear fourth - order ordinary differential equation system in the functions @xmath34 , @xmath35 : @xmath36    first let us emphasize that every einstein space , satisfying @xmath37 , is an exact solution of this effective theory given in ( [ eq field equation for semiclassical theory ] ) . note the particular case when the constant @xmath5 : vacuum solutions of einstein s equations are also exact solutions of ( [ eq field equation for semiclassical theory ] ) .",
    "so there is the following exact solution of ( [ eq field equation for semiclassical theory ] ) for bianchi @xmath1 with the diagonal metric @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an integration constant .",
    "the particular case when @xmath41 , is of course minkowski space .",
    "the intention is to characterize the obtained numerical solutions in some way .",
    "the weyl tensor follows from the riemann tensor as @xmath42    a complex null basis can be defined @xmath43 with the corresponding null metric @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the null vectors in ( [ basenula ] ) .",
    "the newman - penrose complex coefficients are in fact the tetrad components of the weyl tensor @xmath47 also the ricci tensor can be projected to the null tetrad , resulting into the independent components , @xmath48 the first @xmath11 and the last one are real , and the remaining ones are arbitrary complex numbers comprising of course 10 independent components .",
    "the newman - penrose coefficients are related to the petrov classification as shown for example in refs . and . when all the @xmath49 s are zero it s a petrov type o , which characterizes a conformal minkowski space and the weyl tensor vanishes .",
    "an exactly conformally flat solution is either a generalized friedmann solution or an interior schwarzschild solution as it can be seen for example in ref .",
    "minkowski and de sitter geometries , are particular cases of conformally flat solutions .    before getting into the numeric result",
    ", we call the attention to the book@xcite , pp . 62- 64 .",
    "as it is well written there , there is not a complete statement as to what constitutes a minimal set for ensuring that a cosmological model is close to friedmann - lemaitre model .",
    "this book is based on an article by stoeger _",
    "et al_. @xcite for which some assumptions are made : i ) einstein s equations are satisfied .",
    "ii ) the source is a mixture of radiation and dust .",
    "we are not concerned if the two above conditions are satisfied in this present work .",
    "so we do not expect that their result , albeit being very interesting , should be verified in the particular context being discussed here .    in the following",
    "we will present a particular example . consider the bianchi @xmath1 metric written in the appropriate coordinate base @xmath50 @xmath51 the time like vector @xmath52 is geodesic and orthogonal to the group orbit . the magnetic part @xmath53 , and the electric @xmath25 part of the weyl tensor is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the above defined newman - penrose coefficient @xmath56 also regarding ( [ cexemplo ] ) , the expansion @xmath57 , @xmath58 is @xmath59 now consider @xmath60 from ( [ fcexemplo ] ) it is easily seen that ( [ cexemplo ] ) as @xmath61 is @xmath62 which is minkowski geometry .    considering ( [ fcexemplo ] ) and ( [ cexemplo ] ) ,",
    "now we can explicitly obtain the asymptotic @xmath61 limits of the newman - penrose coefficient ( [ psi2 ] ) and the expansion ( [ expansao ] ) to be @xmath63    this example shows that definition 2.1 of @xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 is not necessary for the asymptotic approach to a friedmann - lemaitre model . of course the authors of ref .",
    "were aware of this fact as it can be read on pg .",
    "64 where they carefully write that : if definition 2.1 is satisfied , then the metric can be locally written in an almost - rw form .    as a final word we will use a different criteria , namely , inspired in ( [ psi , h , assintoticos ] ) , the asymptotic tetrad components of the weyl and ricci tensor @xmath66 where @xmath67 , and the const .",
    "values do not have to vanish , which is less restrictive than ( [ cellis ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the asymptotic behavior of the tetrad components ( [ criterio ] ) is a weaker criteria than the one given in definition 2.1 of ref . .",
    "for instance , kasner s @xcite exact solution and the exact bianchi @xmath68 gravity wave of ref .",
    "obey ( [ criterio ] ) with @xmath69 : on the other hand these two exact solutions do not satisfy ( [ cellis ] ) .",
    "so in principle our criteria would not distinguish between kasner exact anisotropic solution , and for example , the limit as @xmath61 given in ( [ cexassint ] ) , with ( [ fcexemplo ] ) and ( [ cexemplo ] ) , which is clearly a space for which isotropisation occurs in the strong sense .",
    "we choose the an initial condition near the exact de sitter ( [ soldesitter ] ) solution with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",

    "the quadratic gravity is the result of vacuum polarization counter terms which must be introduced into einstein s theory of gravitation",
    ". it should be the most natural theory just after the planck era .",
    "it must be emphasized that although numeric the solutions are exact in the sense that they depend only on the precision of the machine .",
    "we have previously , numerically investigated bianchi @xmath1 type solutions @xcite .",
    "we found that there is a basin of attraction to minkowski space for @xmath5 and a basin of attraction to de sitter space for @xmath7 , see @xcite . in this sense , minkowski and de",

    "the the solution is chosen near minkowski exact solution .",
    "the solutions are understood asymptotically in the following sense .",
    "the riemann tensor depends on the weyl tensor , ricci tensor and riemann scalar .",
    "the numerical solutions are characterized asymptotically according to the null tetrad components of the above tensors .    in this sense , for the first solution under consideration in section 3.1 , the weyl tensor is zero and the ricci tensor is proportional to the metric @xmath101 asymptotically and we identify this solution with de sitter space . in section 3.2",
    "the solution asymptotes minkowski space in sense that the weyl tenosr and ricci tensor vanish asymptotically .",
    "the convergence to minkowski space is not so fast and we shall not address this question in this present work . in section 3.3 a solution that converges to a singularity is presented .    in all the cases we considered , the numerical behavior described in the text",
    "was checked for much larger times that the ones plotted , and we believe that asymptotical interpretation is the correct one .",
    "so this work is in accordance with previous results obtained by on us for the more particular case of the diagonal bianchi @xmath1 case @xcite . as in the diagonal metric case , note the presence of the singularity , depending on the initial condition : this theory certainly can not be understood as a complete one because an initially reasonable condition evolves to a singular universe . on the other hand , depending on",
    "the initial condition isotropisation occurs in a weak sense , see discussion on pg . 3 of this work .",
    "since the initial conditions are near de sitter and minkowski solutions , we can speculate that also for bianchi @xmath1 solutions , de sitter and minkowski space should be structurally stable according to the effective gravity for the non diagonal metric also , in the sense that there should be basins of attraction to these solutions . we intend to address this stability issue in a future work .",
