    "we adopt @xmath1 as mean reddening value for hodge301 .",
    "the effect of interstellar extinction on a target star depends on the star s spectral energy distribution within a chosen filter . for a detailed description of the temperature dependence of extinction see grebel & roberts ( 1995 ) , whose relations can be used to perform a color - dependent dereddening .",
    "the passbands of the wfpc2 broadband filters deviate from johnson - cousins @xmath34 passbands .",
    "thus one should in principle deredden the wfpc2 magnitudes before applying the transformation to observed _ uvi _ colors .",
    "holtzman et al.s ( 1995 ) table 12 gives extinction in the primary wfpc2 filters as a function of effective temperature .",
    "we carried out the corresponding color - dependent dereddening in the wfpc2 filter system and transformed subsequently to the observed _ uvi _ system .",
    "a comparison of magnitudes resulting from color - dependent dereddening prior to transformation to the ground - based system and after transformation to this system showed only small offsets of the order of @xmath35 . in the following sections we will use photometry obtained by dereddening in the wfpc2 flight system and transforming subsequently to the ground - based _ uvi _ system .",
    "differential reddening may be present across hodge301 .",
    "since the effects of differential reddening are difficult to disentangle from effects of stellar rotation ( collins & smith 1985 ; collins et al .  1991 ) and binarity , no attempt was made to deredden stars individually .",
    "our _ v , ( v  i ) _ color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) shows a main sequence extending over @xmath36 magnitudes in @xmath37 ( figure [ fig_h301_cmd ] , upper panel ) , blue and red supergiants , and a few red giants belonging to the intermediate - age lmc field population ( @xmath38 mag , @xmath39 ) .",

    "spectroscopic spectral classifications ( as opposed to _ uit _ classifications ) of stars contained within the pc chip comprise the supergiants and two bright peculiar b2 stars ( table [ tbl_2 ] ) .",
    "the main sequence shows considerable scatter at its massive end in the _ v , ( v  i ) _ cmd . as we will show in section [ sect_be ] , this is caused mainly by be stars , but may in part also be caused by differential reddening , rotation , and/or binarity .",
    "the cluster is very well resolved in the pc images , and due to its low stellar density crowding should not have much of an effect on the width of the upper main sequence .",
    "we used isochrones from the geneva group ( schaerer et al .",
    "1993 ) and from the padua group ( e.g. , bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) at the mean metallicity of the young lmc population ( z=0.008 ) to estimate the age of hodge301 .",
    "isochrones from the two groups have similar input physics , but differ in the nuclear energy generation rates assumed in particular for the @xmath40c(@xmath41)@xmath42o reaction , which leads to different extensions of the blue loops ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig_h301_cmd ] ) .",
    "since the data were dereddened already ( section [ sect_red ] ) , the remaining ingredients for the isochrone fits are distance and age .",
    "the distance of the magellanic clouds remains under debate .",
    "we adopt here the ` canonical ' value of @xmath43 for the lmc ( e.g. , westerlund 1997 ; van den bergh 1999 ) , and @xmath44 for 30dor ( crotts et al .  1995 ; panagia 1999 ) .",
    "the geneva and padua models were calculated for single , non - rotating stars and should therefore reproduce the blue main sequence envelope in our cmds . as can be seen in figure [ fig_h301_cmd",
    "] this is indeed the case for the upper main sequence .",
    "since the location of the apparent main sequence turnoff can be affected by binaries and rotation ( e.g. , grebel et al .",
    "1996 ) and is best determined in conjunction with spectroscopy ( massey et al .",
    "1995a ) we rely primarily on the blue and red supergiants to age - date hodge301 .",
    "stars only spend about one tenth of their main - sequence lifetime as supergiants .",
    "supergiants thus allow one to constrain ages more accurately .",
    "note , however , that neither set of isochrones can reproduce the color loci of the reddest supergiants , a shortcoming that is also noticed in ground - based data .    when comparing coeval padua and geneva isochrones with ages of the order of @xmath45 years one finds that the main - sequence turnoff and the supergiant locus lie at brighter @xmath37 magnitudes for the padua isochrones , which results in higher age estimates for padua models .",
    "the geneva isochrones indicate an age of 20 myr for hodge301 , while 25 myr is best compatible with the padua isochrones .",
    "we conservatively estimate the uncertainty of both age determinations to be @xmath46 myr .    a comparison of wfpc2 cmds of r136 and hodge301 is shown in figure [ fig_h301_r136 ] . the r136 data from hunter et al .",

    "we derive the magnitude bins corresponding to the appropriate mass intervals from a geneva isochrone with an age of 20 myr and z=0.008 .",
    "this procedure implicitly assumes that each star is a single , non - rotating star , which is certainly an oversimplification .",
    "logarithmic mass intervals with the size of @xmath87 log ( @xmath80 ) = 0.1 were chosen .",
    "the upper limit of each logarithmic mass bin , the absolute magnitudes , and star counts based on stars detected in both @xmath70 and @xmath88 are given in table [ tbl_4 ] .",
    "the uncertainties listed there are the square root of the counts .",
    "a weighted least - squares fit results in a mass function slope of @xmath89 ( figure [ fig_lf ] , solid line ) .",
    "the determination of the slope is based on 819 stars ranging from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , covering 6.6 magnitudes in @xmath37 .",
    "we note that massey & hunter ( 1998 ) found @xmath92 to @xmath93 for stars @xmath94 in r136 in perfect agreement with a salpeter slope .    the lowest mass bin considered here ( 1.26  1 @xmath3 ; @xmath95 ) was not included in the subsequent calculation of the slope of the mass function due to the increasing incompleteness ( see above and figure [ fig_complete ] ) .",
    "also , toward the low - mass end of this mass bin pms stars may begin to play a role . the highest mass bin in figure [ fig_lf ] ( @xmath96 ; not included in table [ tbl_4 ] ) contains stars above the apparent main - sequence turnoff . to avoid uncertainties introduced by supergiant mass loss and incompleteness due to evolutionary effects ,",
    "this bin was not considered in the slope calculation , either , despite its apparently good agreement with the derived mass function .      since",
    "a mass function slope derived from bona - fide main - sequence stars is essentially an imf slope , we can extrapolate to higher masses to estimate the initial number of massive stars in hodge301 .",
    "the resulting value serves as a crude indication only since a sparse cluster such as hodge301 would have had very few very massive stars to begin with , and we have no way of telling up to which mass the imf was originally populated . assuming that hodge301 had initially stars as massive as @xmath97 and a uniformly populated imf , we find that up to @xmath6 stars ranging from @xmath98 may have turned into supernovae since its formation .",
    "the uncertainty of this number was derived from monte - carlo simulations to better evaluate the effects of small - number statistics and the stochastic nature of the upper mass cut - off of imfs ( see , e.g. , elmegreen 1997 ) .",
    "the total mass of hodge301 can be calculated analytically for a chosen mass range and the above derived imf slope .",
    "monte - carlo simulations were used to evaluate stochastic effects on the imf . within the well - observed bona - fide main - sequence mass bins from @xmath91 to @xmath90 we find a total mass of ( @xmath99 ) @xmath3 . if we assume that the cluster continues to follow a salpeter imf down to @xmath100 , this adds additional ( @xmath101 ) @xmath3 .",
    "this value is highly speculative since we have not established that ( 1 ) the slope derived for intermediate - mass stars is valid also for low - mass stars , and ( 2 ) the salpeter law is indeed valid for low - mass stars in hodge301 ( cf .",
    "miller & scalo 1979 ) .",
    "the estimated number of low - mass stars from @xmath100 to @xmath91 is @xmath102 .",
    "inclusion of the mass range from @xmath90 to @xmath103 , which is the highest observed mass bin in hodge301 and consists in part of supergiants , adds another ( @xmath104 ) @xmath3 .",
    "this results in an estimated present - day cluster mass of @xmath105 @xmath3 from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "the true uncertainty is likely larger than this .",
    "extrapolation from @xmath103 to @xmath47 yields ( @xmath108 ) @xmath3 and suggests an initial stellar mass of the cluster of ( @xmath109 ) @xmath3 .",
    "the estimate of the cluster mass from low - mass stars alone exceeds recent estimates of the total stellar mass of galactic open clusters such as the pleiades ( pinfield et al .",
    "1998 : @xmath110 , @xmath111 myr ) or praesepe ( raboud & mermilliod 1998 : 300  1330 @xmath3 , @xmath112 myr ) . on the other hand , hodge301 is a lot less massive than r136 , where some 65 stars with masses around 120 @xmath3 were detected , while the cluster follows a normal , salpeter - like imf ( massey & hunter 1998 ) .      spectroscopy of star wb9=be1 ( walborn & blades 1997 ) indicates that it may have a compact companion ( section [ sect_bss ] ) .",
    "as noted by these authors , the companion may be the stellar remnant of one of the earlier supernova events .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) around hodge301 gives further clues of a violent past .",
    "is located within shell 3 in 30dor ( cox & deharveng 1983 ) .",
    "shell 3 has a diameter of 120 pc , which is comparable to those of typical superbubbles formed by ob associations or clusters in the lmc .",
    "shell 3 nevertheless has two remarkable features : bright diffuse x - ray emission ( wang & helfand 1991 ; wang 1999 , see his figure 3 particularly ) and highly supersonic gas motions ( meaburn 1988 ) .",
    "observations of 30dor s kinematics show that shell 3 hosts multiple expanding substructures and that some of the substructures have the most extreme expansion velocities , approaching 300 km  s@xmath60 , in 30dor ( chu & kennicutt 1994 , see their figures 7c and 7d ) .",
    "both the diffuse x - ray emission and violent motions of shell 3 are characteristic of supernova remnants , and the multiple centers of expansion further indicate multiple supernova explosions .",
    "these physical properties thus fully support a dynamic interaction between hodge301 and the ambient ism in 30dor . to study the details of this interaction ,",
    "we have mapped the velocity structure of the wfpc2 field using long - slit echelle spectra ; these data will be reported in another paper ( chu et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "walborn & blades ( 1997 ) identify four different spatial and temporal structures in the starburst region of 30dor .",
    "the hodge301 cluster is the most prominent representative of the oldest component .",
    "other recognizable members of this oldest population include a few massive m and a supergiants found mainly to the east and south of the central ionizing cluster ( e.g. , westerlund 1961 ; mendoza & gmez 1973 ; hyland et al .",
    "1978 ; mcgregor & hyland 1981 ; parker 1993 ) . in figure [ fig_30dor_age ]",
    "we have marked stars with spectroscopic classifications that trace the different subpopulations in 30dor .",
    "the distribution of k , m , and a stars is representative of the oldest population are shown in the upper left panel of this figure .",
    "recent _ hst _ nicmos observations of 30dor ( walborn et al.1999 ) confirmed embedded protostars ( walborn & blades 1987 ; hyland et al .  1992 ; rubio et al .",
    "1992 ) , and led to the detection of previously unknown small embedded clusters and bok globules with forming stars .",
    "together with the younger components listed by walborn & blades ( 1997 ) , this demonstrates that star formation in the nearest extragalactic starburst region has occurred repeatedly over the past 20  25 myr and is still continuing .",
    "hyland et al .  ( 1992 ) suggested that the massive stars observed today as red supergiants in the vicinity of the r136 cluster may have triggered the star formation in its birth cloud making it commence from many directions .",
    "the multiple hii shells in the 30dor periphery , which show pronounced diffuse x - ray emission ( wang & helfand 1991 ; wang 1999 ; and upper left panel in our figure [ fig_30dor_age ] ) and which are likely the result of repeated supernova explosions seem to give further support to an `` outside - in '' scenario of star formation .",
    "the most recent star formation is occurring in the dense filaments surrounding r136 ( examples are marked in the lower right panel of figure [ fig_30dor_age ] ) .",
    "however , there is no clear evidence of sequentially triggered star formation , and it is conceivable that the repeated star formation events occurred _ sua sponte _ in a clumpy , increasingly turbulent giant molecular cloud .",
    "we have analyzed _ hst _ wfpc2 data of the sparse cluster hodge301 in 30dor , which lies @xmath0 northwest of the massive central ionizing cluster r136 .",
    "the published spectral classifications of the supergiants in hodge301 indicate already that this cluster is not as young as r136 . depending on the evolutionary models used our photometry yields an age of @xmath113 myr ( padua isochrones ) or @xmath114 myr ( geneva isochrones ) , which is @xmath115 10 times as old as the age of r136 as derived from its massive stars .",
    "hodge301 contains be star candidates , which we identified based on their h@xmath57 excess .",
    "the highest be star fraction is found among the earliest b spectral types at the main - sequence turnoff region , as is typical for clusters in this age range ( grebel 1997 ) .",
    "we provide a finding chart and a table with equatorial coordinates and photometry of the be star candidates .",
    "two stars above the apparent main - sequence turnoff but below the locus of the a supergiants may be blue stragglers .",
    "one of them was identified as a possible binary with a compact companion ( walborn & blades 1997 ) and shows h@xmath57 emission in our data .",
    "this star may be a be x - ray binary .",
    "we derive a 3@xmath61 upper limit on the x - ray luminosity of wb9 of @xmath6710@xmath68 erg  s@xmath60 in the _ rosat _ 0.12.4 kev band .",
    "we derive a mass function for the main - sequence stars in hodge301 spanning a mass range from 10 to 1.26 @xmath3 and find a slope of @xmath116 . thus hodge301 has a normal mass function slope in excellent agreement with a salpeter slope and with the results of massey et al .",
    "( 1995a ) and hunter et al .",
    "( 1997b ) for young associations and clusters in the magellanic clouds ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the slope is slightly steeper than what hunter et al.(1995 ; 1996 ) and selman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found for the intermediate - mass stars in r136 ( slopes ranging from @xmath118 to @xmath119 ) , and steeper than the mean slope in the milky way clusters and associations ( @xmath120 ; massey et al .",
    "1995b ) . as discussed by hunter et al .",
    "( 1997b ) and sagar & griffith ( 1998 ) , deviations of this magnitude may be more indicative of the overall uncertainties in the derivation of a mass function and of the corrections applied than of a significant change of slope .",
    "sirianni et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that the imf of r136 shows a clear flattening below @xmath121 . in hodge301",
    "no such flattening is observed down to @xmath122 .",
    "we estimate the total present - day mass of hodge301 to be @xmath105 @xmath3 from @xmath100 to @xmath103 if a salpeter function with a single slope is indeed valid over this entire mass range .    extrapolating hodge301 s mass function to @xmath123 we find that as many as @xmath124 massive stars may have evolved into supernovae since the cluster was formed .",
    "this is consistent with the highly supersonic gas motions and the diffuse x - ray emission in hodge301 s surroundings , which indicate multiple supernova explosions .",
    "30dor is considered a prototypical starburst region .",
    "its complexity illustrates the importance to consider multiple generations of star and cluster formation when interpreting distant , unresolved starburst regions",
    ". their integrated light may be the result of repeated , distinct star formation episodes that may have spanned a few @xmath45 years rather than just one instantaneous star formation event .",
    "their gas kinematics and velocity dispersion depends on their star formation history and the energy feedback from massive stars .",
    "apart from turbulence , thermal broadening and a gravitational component contribute ( e.g. , yang et al .",
    "depending on the evolutionary stage and star formation history of a giant hii region , the proportionality of these three components can be different .",
    "the complex evolutionary history and spatial structure should be taken into account in the modelling of ghrs and starbursts , as thornley et al .",
