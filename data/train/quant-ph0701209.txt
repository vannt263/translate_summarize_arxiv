    "for example , if the temperature of a ghz namr reaches @xmath163 mk , the thermal occupation number will be @xmath164 , which is nearly a ground state .    in conclusion",

    "we have shown that two - mode squeezed states can be generated in a robust fashion by this device , in analogy to the two - mode parametric down - conversion process in quantum optics .",
    "this two - mode down - conversion process offers us a protocol of producing entanglement in two mechanical resonators in a solid state device , while previous proposals , see , e.g. , refs .  ,",
    "were based on entanglement - swapping by the assistance of photons .",
