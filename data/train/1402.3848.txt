    "in the recent papers @xcite , we started a study of self - interaction of static electric and magnetic fields of moderate strength  in the vacuum @xcite or taken against a very strong background formed by a constant and homogeneous magnetic field shagit2012 . by `` moderate '' we mean the fields that are strong enough to make the nonlinearity of qed actual for their self - interaction , but still assumed smaller than the characteristic value @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are electron mass and charge , to enable us to exploit the expansion of the nonlinear maxwell equations in powers of the fields and confine ourselves to the lowest terms in this expansion . on the contrary , the background field is not limited either from below or from above .",
    "it was observed that effects of selfinteraction manifest themselves already within the simplest approximation of local action , valid in the infrared region of momenta , i.e. for fields that do not change any essentially at the time or space interval of @xmath5 among these effects are nonlinear corrections to the coulomb field in the vacuum @xcite , making the field energy of a point charge finite @xcite , electromagnetic nonlinear renormalization of electric and magnetic dipole moments of mesons and baryons @xcite , necessary after the latter are calculated following the theory of strong interaction . in the present paper",
    ", we continue the work @xcite , where it was pointed out that the quadratic response of the strong background magnetic field to an applied moderate electric field is purely magnetic , and the nonlinear current induced by an applied electric field  was calculated based on the third - rank polarization tensor ( a three - photon vertex beyond the mass shell ) in the infrared ( local ) limit .",
    "also , a general expression was given for the magnetic field nonlinearly induced by an electrostatic field .",
    "below we demonstrate that this field is that of a magnetic dipole .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment carried by a static spherical charge of finite extension is calculated .",
    "we estimate the force acting on this magnetic moment by the inhomogeneous magnetic field of a neutron star and a magnetar . if we admit that in the course of the phase transition of the neutron star to a quark star @xcite highly charged domains of strange matter @xcite may exist , then the observed effect may form a mechanism of charge outflow from the star .",
    "the nonlinear response of the magnetized vacuum to applied electrostatic field within the nonlinear maxwell equations truncated at the third power of the field is purely magnetic @xcite , with the vector potential components @xmath6 being given as ( we keep to the rationalized heaviside - lorentz units throughout ) @xmath7where @xmath8 is the fourier - transformed nonlinearly induced current@xmath9and @xmath10 is the third - rank polarization tensor in the coordinate representation defined as the third variational derivative of the effective action @xmath11 with respect to the field potential taken in three space - time points @xmath12 in qed it includes all diagrams with three off - shell outer photons in the external magnetic field . in ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath13 are the three eigenvectors of the second - rank polarization tensor in the background magnetic field , responsible for the linear response in that field , and @xmath14 are the corresponding eigenvalues . out of the three components of the photon propagator that build a field from a ( nonlinear ) current , only two contribute into the sum in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "this means that in the static limit only two eigenmodes are responsible for carrying magnetic field .",

    "simultaneously , the contribution of the first mode @xmath85 disappears from ( [ 1 ] ) .",
