    "rare b decays are induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at loop level in the standard model ( sm ) and they are rich phenomenologically .",
    "they open a window for the determination of free parameters in the sm and also the investigation of the physics beyond , such as , two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc . the experimental work for rare b",
    "decays continue at slac ( babar ) , kek ( belle ) , b - factories , desy ( hera - b ) and this stimulates the theoretical effort on them .",
    "the exclusive @xmath3 process is an important candidate among rare b decays .",
    "since its branching ratio ( @xmath4 ) predicted in the sm is large , there is a strong hope that this physical quantity is measured in the near future .",
    "the inclusive decay which induces @xmath3 process is @xmath5 transition and it is extensively studied in the literature , in the framework of the sm , 2hdm and mssm . in @xcite-@xcite , @xmath5 process is studied for light lepton pairs , namely @xmath6 . in this case , the neutral higgs boson ( nhb ) effects can be neglected since those contributions are proportional to the light lepton masses or corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "however for @xmath7 , the nhb effects give sizable contributions . in @xcite @xmath8 process",
    "was studied in the model i , ii versions the 2hdm and it was shown that nhb effects are important for large values of @xmath9 .",
    "currently the inclusive @xmath5 decay was studied in the model iii version of 2hdm @xcite and it was observed that nhb effects can give considerable contribution if the yukawa interaction between @xmath10 lepton and neutral higgs bosons is large .",
    "the theoretical analysis of exclusive decays is difficult due to the hadronic form factors which contain uncertainities .",
    "however , their experimental investigation is easier compared to the one for the inclusive decays .",
    "the calculation of physical observables in the hadronic level needs non - perturbative methods . in the literature",
    "there are different studies based on different approches , such as relativistic quark model by lightfront formalism @xcite , chiral theory @xcite , three point qcd sum rules method @xcite , effective heavy quark theory @xcite and light cone qcd sum rules @xcite .    with the measured upper limit @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) for the @xmath4 of the decay @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite , the process @xmath15 have reached great interest .",
    "there are various studies on these decays in the sm , sm with fourth generation , multi higgs doublet models , mssm and in a model independent way , in the literature @xcite-@xcite and @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the cp violating effect is an important physical quantity to ensure the information about the free parameters of the model used .",
    "since the cp violation for @xmath15 decay almost vanishes in the sm due to the unitarity of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and smallness of the term @xmath16 , we have a chance to investigate the physics beyond the sm by searching the cp violating effects . in the model iii version of the 2hdm",
    ", there is a new source for cp violation , namely complex yukawa couplings . in @xcite ,",
    "cp violating effects due to new phases in the model iii and three higgs doublet model , @xmath17 , were studied and it was observed that a considerable cp asymmetry was obtained .    in this work , we study the exclusive @xmath18 decay in the general 2hdm , so - called model iii , by including nhb effects .",
    "we use the quark level effective hamiltonian which is calculated in @xcite and investigate the @xmath19 and the forward - backward asymmetry ( @xmath20 ) of the lepton pair for the process underconsideration .",
    "further , we calculate the cp asymmetry in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and observe that it can be measured in the forthcoming experiments .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the leading order ( lo ) qcd corrected effective hamiltonian and the corresponding matrix element for the inclusive @xmath22 decay , including nhb effects .",
    "further , we give the matrix element for the exclusive @xmath18 decay and the explicit expressions for @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the dependencies of @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath23 on the cp parameter @xmath24 , yukawa coupling @xmath25 and the mass ratio @xmath26 and to the discussion of our results . in appendices ,",
    "we give the explicit forms of the operators appearing in the effective hamiltonian , the corresponding wilson coefficients and the form factors existing in the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "in the model iii , the flavour changing neutral currents in the tree level are permitted and various new parameters , such as yukawa couplings , masses of new higgs bosons , exist .",
    "yukawa couplings describe the interaction of fermions with gauge bosons .",
    "our starting point is the inclusive @xmath27 process which induces the exclusive @xmath0 decay and the corresponding yukawa interaction is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are family indices of quarks ( leptons ) , @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote chiral projections @xmath33 , @xmath34 for @xmath35 , are the two scalar doublets , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are quark ( lepton ) doublets , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the corresponding quark ( lepton ) singlets , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the matrices of the yukawa couplings which have complex entries in general . here",

    "further , we take @xmath47 , @xmath48 as the mass eigenstates @xmath49 , @xmath50 respectively .",
    "note that , at tree level , there is no mixing among cp even neutral higgs bosons , namely the sm one , @xmath51 , and beyond , @xmath49 .",

    "the charged couplings are the linear combinations of neutral couplings multiplied by @xmath58 matrix elements ( see @xcite for details ) .    at this stage",
    "we would like to present the calculation of the matrix element for the inclusive @xmath27 decay , briefly .",
    "the procedure is the following :    * the calculation of the full theory including the nhb effects which comes from the interactions of neutral higgs bosons @xmath51 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath10 lepton . * overcoming the logarithmic divergences by using the on - shell renormalization scheme . here",
