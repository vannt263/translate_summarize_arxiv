    "the interaction of antikaon ( @xmath7 ) with nucleon ( @xmath8 ) has drawn attention for decades @xcite since this interaction provides essential elements to understand the strangeness in nuclear hadron physics .",
    "the @xmath9 interaction is strongly attractive in the isospin @xmath10 and also the @xmath11 interaction is attractive at low energies .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath11 are the most important channels for the @xmath3 : these two channels dynamically generate the quasi bound @xmath3 .    to understand the many body kaonic nuclear system , the @xmath12 is the simplest system .",
    "the investigation of this system started in the 60 s @xcite .",
    "more recently , using the variational approach , a @xmath12 state was found bound by 48 mev with width of 60 mev @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath13 three body system was investigated using the variational approach taking the results of @xmath14 interactions from a chiral @xmath15 model , and they get a much less bound @xmath13 state with , b=19 mev and @xmath16=40 - 70 mev . in a further paper ,",
    "the same group quantifies the uncertainties and evaluates the extra width coming from @xmath0 absorption from the pair of nucleons , with the results of b=20 - 40 mev and @xmath16 as large as 100 mev with admitted large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "coupled channel three body calculations of the quasi bound @xmath12 system were investigated in @xcite using faddeev equations , and their results for the binding is 50 - 70 mev and the width around 100 mev .",
    "the work of @xcite studied three body resonances in the @xmath12 system within a framework of the @xmath17 coupled channel faddeev equation . in this work they found the binding energy 79 mev with a width of 74 mev",
    "however , in more recent papers @xcite , where the energy dependence of the potential is taken from chiral dynamics , the same authors find much smaller binding energies , below 20 mev .",
    "we also calculated the @xmath12 system @xcite for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 case , using the fixed center approximation ( fca ) to the faddeev equations taking into account @xmath18 channel explicitly and also including the charge exchange diagrams .",
    "we get a binding of 26 - 35 mev for @xmath5 while around 9 mev for the @xmath6 case .",
    "the widths are in both cases around 50 mev .",
    "a very recent variational calculation @xcite finds that the @xmath5 state is bound by about 16 mev and the @xmath6 by less than 11 mev .",
    "the widths , without including @xmath19 absorption by a pair of nucleons , are around 40 mev .",
    "the fca to the faddeev equations is an efficient and useful method to investigate many body systems .",
    "it relies upon having a pair of particles that interact strongly among themselves and make a cluster that is supposed not to be much disturbed by the interaction of the third particle with it .",
    "then all that is left is the possibility that the third particle interacts with the components of the cluster and this is done non perturbative allowing for multiple scattering of this third particle with any of the components of the cluster .",
    "the cluster is then assumed to have the wave function that it would have without the presence of the third particle .",
    "intuitively , one should expect it to work when the third particle is light compared to those of the cluster , or when it is very bound such that it can not allow excitations of the cluster .",
    "there is substantial work to rely on this model .",
    "for instance , the three body @xmath20 scattering amplitude @xcite was calculated using the fca to the faddeev equations and the results of this work are in good agreement with the other theoretical works @xcite evaluated using variational and faddeev approaches , respectively .",
    "besides , in @xcite , using the same model , the authors give a plausible explanation for the @xmath21 puzzle .",
    "as important as to know the success of the fca , it is to know the limitation of this procedure , and it was found in @xcite that the approximation collapses for the study of resonant states , where there is plenty of phase space for the excitation of intermediate states .",
    "meson nucleus bound systems are good laboratories to investigate the finite density qcd .",
    "the existence of the @xmath22 bound states in nuclear systems , which are called kaonic nuclei , is theoretically expected because of the strong attractive interactions between the @xmath22 and the nucleon .",
    "models range from empirical ones with a depth of around 200 mev at normal nuclear matter density @xcite , to those imposing chiral symmetry constraints that lead to an attraction of around 40 - 50 mev @xcite .",
    "however there is no experimental evidence on this system . in spite of experimental claims , which have been proved to be unfounded ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on the issue ) .",
    "the large width of the predicted states compared to the binding could justify why such states are not being found @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 is the prototype of the @xmath7 nuclei and to observe the kaonic nuclei in experiments , the precise knowledge of the width of this state is important . in this sense , it is important to recall that in all previous works of the @xmath12 system the source of the width is only the @xmath23 conversion channel .",
    "the absorption channels @xmath24 are not considered explicitly , although in some case it is estimated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "early experiments on @xmath25-nucleus absorption at rest were done in the 1970s . a precise measurement of the total two nucleon absorption of stopped @xmath25 mesons in deuterium was reported in @xcite using deuterium bubble chambers .",
    "this is the first detailed measurement of two nucleon absorption branching ratio and these results were compared with the predictions of isospin invariance for strong interaction .",
    "the ratio of the rates @xmath26 and @xmath27 was in good agreement with the results of isospin invariance for strong interaction .",
    "a similar experiment was done using a helium bubble chamber @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 absorption by two nucleons in nuclei , @xmath28 , has been considered before in the selfconsistent evaluation of the @xmath0 nucleon optical potential of @xcite .",
    "more recently it has also been evaluated in a different way in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential evaluated in @xcite has been checked versus kaonic atoms in @xcite with good agreement with experiment .",
    "the discrepancies seen for the @xmath29 atom have been revolved recently with very precise measurement in @xcite which agree with the early predictions of @xcite .",
    "also the study done in @xcite showed that a best fit to the data could be obtained with a potential that differed from the predicted one of @xcite at the level of 20 @xmath30 .",
    "this agreement with data gives us confidence that the input used in @xcite for the @xmath31 absorption is realistic and we use this input here to evaluate the absorption width of the @xmath1 state .",
