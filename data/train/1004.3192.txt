    "[ 12 - 14 ] the interaction of particles @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the matter is described by the potentials @xmath12 ( potential model ) .",
    "@xmath13 is responsible for loss of @xmath11-particle intensity . in particular , this model is used for the processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) [ 4 - 11 ] .    in [ 10,11 ]",
    "it was shown that one - particle ( potential ) model mentioned above does not describe the processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) and thus total neutron - antineutron transition probability .",
    "for instance , the total neutron - antineutron transition probability given by the potential model is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the annihilation width of @xmath16 in the medium ) , whereas the realistic calculation gives @xmath17 ( see sect",
    ". 5 ) . in the potential model",
    "the effect of final state absorption ( annihilation ) acts in the opposite ( wrong ) direction , which tends to the additional suppression of the @xmath0 transition .",
    "so the potential model should be rejected .",
    "the @xmath1-matrix should be _",
    "unitary_.    ( for the oscillations in the external field [ 15,16 ] the hamiltonian is hermitian and so the absorption is described correctly .",
    "the above - given remark holds only for the processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) calculated by means of potential model ( non - hermitian hamiltonian ) .",
    "we also note that the potential model describes correctly the channel with @xmath16 in the final state [ 11 ] . )",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath1-matrix means that new model should be developed . in [ 8,9 ] we have proposed the model of the @xmath0 transition in medium followed by annihilation which does not contain the non - hermitian operators .",
    "it is shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath0 transitions in finite nuclei followed by annihilation ( process ( 1 ) ) are considered .",
    "the process model is shown in fig .",
    "the reason is that the limit is extracted from the nuclear annihilation lifetime and so one should calculate the process ( 1 ) and not ( 2 ) . as we shall see later , the results are the same as for nuclear matter . however , this fact is not obvious since the calculations for the processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are essentially different .",

    "the qualitative process picture is as follows .",
    "the free - space @xmath0 transition comes from the exchange of higgs bosons with the mass @xmath18 gev [ 2 ] and so the subprocess of @xmath0 conversion is scarcely affected by a medium effects . from the dynamical point of view",

    "we deal with two - step process with the characteristic time @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the localization of the neutron incide the nucleus _ does not tend to suppress _ of the @xmath0 conversion .",
    "this can be also understood using the analogy with the nuclear @xmath22 decay and decay of free neutron .",

    "essential drawbacks_. the model as well as possible suppression mechanisms are studied in [ 9,17 ] . in present paper the particular attention was given to the model with bare propagator since the corresponding calculations are non - typical .",
    "it is significant that @xmath134 rises quadratically as @xmath133 .",
    "this circumstance should be clarified ; otherwise the model under study can be rejected .",
    "the calculation in the framework of the model with bare propagator gives the finite result , which justifies our approach from a conceptual point of view and consideration of the model with bare propagator at least as the limiting case .",
    "in fact this model seems quite realistic in itself [ 9,17 ] . in this connection",
    "we recall the reasons owing to which the approach with finite time interval has been used .",
    "since the @xmath1-matrix should be unitary , the calculation should be done beyond the potential model .",
    "however , the @xmath1-matrix amplitude based on hermitian hamiltonian contains unremovable peculiarity .",
    "moreover , for the problem under study the @xmath1-matrix problem formulation @xmath60 is physically incorrect [ 9 ] . for these reasons",

    "if the problem is formulated on the finite time interval , the decay width @xmath15 can not be introduced since @xmath135 , @xmath136 .",
    "this means that the standard calculation scheme should be completely revised .",
    "we point to the important detail of the model which explains the absence of the suppression .",
    "it is seen from eqs .",
    "( 14 ) and ( 27 ) that due to zero momentum transfer both pre- and post-@xmath0 conversion spatial wave functions of the system coincide : @xmath137 recall that the neutron potential is included in @xmath42 ; the @xmath16-nuclear interaction @xmath138 is involved in @xmath139 . since the hamiltonian @xmath138 acts on the antineutron",
    ", it is turned on following the forming of the @xmath16-nucleus and so eq . ( 44 ) takes place .",
    "there is no energy gap @xmath140 which can lead to a very strong suppression of @xmath0 transition .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0 transition changes only the internal quantum numbers of neutron : @xmath141 [ 4 ] .",
    "relation ( 44 ) explains the result ( 29 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we view the results of the model with bare propagator with certain caution since the process is extremely sensitive to the details of the model . indeed , in the models with bare and dressed propagators the interaction hamiltonians @xmath139 and unperturbed hamiltonians are the same .",
    "the sole physical distinction between models is the zero antineutron self - energy in the model with bare propagator .",
    "however , it leads to the fundamentally different results ( see ( 29 ) and ( 38 ) ) .",
    "this is because the amplitude ( 12 ) is in the peculiar point .",
    "due to this the problem is extremely sensitive to the value of antineutron self - energy @xmath118 as well as the description of initial neutron state [ 18 ] and the value of momentum transfered in the @xmath0 transitions vertex [ 17 ] .    in conclusion , new model of @xmath0 transitions in nuclei based on unitary",
    "@xmath1-matrix has been considered .",
    "since the results are the same as for nuclear matter , the conclusions are identical as well ( see sect . 5 of ref . [ 17 ] ) : taking into account the result sensitivity to the details of the model , the values @xmath142 s and @xmath99 yr are interpreted as the estimations from below ( conservative limit ) and from above , respectively .",
    "so the realistic limit @xmath3 can be in the range @xmath143    the estimation from below @xmath144 exceeds the restriction given by potential model by a factor of 5 and the lower limit given by the grenoble reactor experiment [ 3 ] by a factor of 14 . at the same time the range of uncertainty of @xmath3 is too wide .",
