    "a first step for understanding the behavior of type - ii superconducting systems is to determine the equilibrium vortex configurations that occur at temperature zero , or the zero - temperature phase diagram .",
    "although this problem has been under study for many years @xcite , there are many systems , such as artificial structures , constrained geometries and anisotropic superconductors , for which some questions remain open .",
    "the situation of greater interest is that of a superconductor subjected to an external magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the theoretical problem of calculating the zero - temperature phase diagram is then to find the vortex configuration that minimizes the gibbs free - energy for a given @xmath0 .",
    "the analytical method to solve this problem determines , instead , the vortex configurations that minimize the energy for a given magnetic induction , @xmath1 , and then calculates @xmath0 from the derivatives of the energy with respect to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "analytical solutions are difficult to obtain and are known only for a few situations .",
    "numerical methods to solve this problem have been proposed .",
    "these attempt to find the zero - temperature phase diagram of a large number of vortices by minimizing the energy , if @xmath1 is kept constant , or the gibbs free - energy , if @xmath0 s kept constant@xcite .",
    "these methods are severely limited by finite - size effects .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a numerical method to calculate configurations of straight vortex lines that minimize the gibbs free - energy of bulk superconductors in the london approximation for a given @xmath0 .",
    "the essential ingredients of our methods are two .",
    "first , we assume that the vortex lines are straight and restrict the search for the minimum free - energy configurations to periodic vortex - line - lattices ( vll ) with a given number of vortex lines per unit cell .",
    "this restriction greatly reduces the number of parameters that we have to vary to find the minimum .",
    "second , we use a rapidly converging series to calculate the lattice sums entering the vortex - vortex interaction energy in the london approximation @xcite .",
    "these ingredients allow us to create a simulated annealing algorithm , using monte carlo techniques , that is fast and , as a consequence , highly accurate .",
    "a closely related method has been used in ref.@xcite to calculate the zero - temperature phase diagram for films under parallel fields .    to illustrate the accuracy of the method",
    "we apply it to the well known problem of a bulk superconductor under a field @xmath2 to obtain the @xmath3 curve and to compare it with known results at high and low fields @xcite .",
    "we also apply the method to find some equilibrium vortex - line configurations in bulk superconductors and in films with a square lattice of columnar defects .",
    "this system is of experimental interest because there are several studies of vortices in films with a lattice of columnar defects created by lithographic techniques or by bombardment with an electron beam @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec.ldt ] we discuss the details of the theoretical model , numerical method and simulated annealing algorithm . in sec .",
    "[ sec.appl ] we report the results of the above mentioned applications . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec.concl ] we state our conclusions .",
    "we consider a bulk uniaxially anisotropic superconductor with a lattice of columnar defects ( cd ) .",
    "we assume that both the vortex lines and the cd are straight and parallel to the c - axis , and that the vortex lines form a periodic vll .",
    "our problem is then to determine , for a given external field parallel to the c - direction , @xmath2 , the vll @xmath4 unit cell , the number of vortex lines and their positions within this cell , that give the absolute minimum of the gibbs free energy per volume @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vortex line - vortex line _ interaction _ energy , @xmath7 is the vortex - cd - lattice interaction energy , @xmath8 is the magnetic induction , @xmath9 is the lower critical field , and @xmath10 is the vortex line self - energy ( @xmath11 penetration depth for currents parallel to the ab - plane , @xmath12 vortex core radius ) .",
    "we first solve the simpler problem of finding the vll with a _ fixed _ number of vortex lines per unit cell , @xmath13 , that minimizes @xmath14 . to find which one of these gives the absolute minimum of @xmath14 we have to compare the free energies of the vll obtained for the same @xmath2 and different @xmath13 , if these are distinct .",
    "assuming that the vll unit cell is defined by the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.ucel ] , or by the corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath17 , the london approximation expression for @xmath6 is @xmath18 \\ ; ,   \\label{eq.evv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the unit cell area and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) denotes the vortex lines positions within the unit cell . for the vll shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.ucel ] , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the vortex - line cd - lattice interaction energy is assumed to be the sum of the single vortex - single cd interaction energies , namely @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of vortex - lattice unit cells , @xmath26 denotes the cell positions , @xmath27 denotes the cd positions and @xmath28 is the single vortex- single cd interaction energy per unit length . the validity of eq .",
    "( [ eq.evcd ] ) requires that the cd radius @xmath29 be such that @xmath30 , so that only a single vortex line can be trapped by the cd , and that the vortex lines mean separation is large compared to @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "( [ eq.evv ] ) , instead of @xmath36 an effective penetration depth @xmath37 .",
    "this mimics the dominant logarithmic vortex - vortex interactions at distances short compared to the film screening length .",
    "the vortex - cd interaction is assumed to be the same for bulk and films .    to numerically minimize @xmath14 , eq .",
    "( [ eq.gfe ] ) , it is necessary to evaluate @xmath6 , eq .",
    "( [ eq.evv ] ) .",
    "because the lattice sum in this expression converges very slowly , a numerical method based on it requires considerable amount of computer time .",
    "doria @xcite showed that the lattice sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq.evv ] ) can be transformed into a series that converges much faster .",
    "we use this series in our calculation to generate an efficient numerical algorithm .",
    "our minimization procedure , based on standard simulated annealing and monte carlo techniques@xcite , is as follows . for a given @xmath2 and @xmath13 , we start with a chosen unit cell shape and vortex lines located within it . by moving the vortex lines , one at a time , and deforming the unit cell",
    "continuously we generate , using a metropolis algorithm , the equilibrium configurations of the cell shapes and vortex lines positions within it , for a given fictitious temperature @xmath38 .",
    "the changes in @xmath14 caused by vortex line motion or by unit cell deformation are calculated using doria s fast convergent series for @xmath6 , and a direct summation over a large cd - lattice for @xmath7 .",
    "the vll that minimizes @xmath14 is identified with the configuration at very low @xmath38 . in order to reduce trapping in metastable states",
    ", @xmath38 is cycled appropriately .",
    "the vll found by the above described method can be either commensurate or incommensurate with the cd - lattice .",
    "only the commensurate ones correspond to true minima of the gibbs free - energy , since we restrict our search for the @xmath14 minima to periodic vortex - line arrangements .",
    "the incommensurate vll , being periodic , feel only the space average of the vortex - cd - lattice potential , that is , a constant @xcite .",
    "consequently , these are triangular vll that minimize @xmath14 , eq .  ( [ eq.gfe ] ) , in the absence of the vortex - cd- lattice interaction . as discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec.racd ] , we expect that in situations where vortex - vortex interactions are strong , such as the ones considered here , our method is capable of predicting not only the commensurate phases , but also of giving reasonable estimates for the range of @xmath2 values over which they minimize @xmath14 .",
    "in this section we apply the method described above to two physical problems .",
    "to illustrate the accuracy of our method , we first apply it to the well known problem of vortex lines in a defect - free superconductor subjected to an external magnetic field @xmath2 pointing in the c - direction . in this case",
    "@xmath14 is minimized by a triangular vll with a single vortex line in the primitive unit cell .",
    "we minimize @xmath14 for several @xmath2 assuming @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we find the triangular lattice in all cases considered .",
    "for a given @xmath2 , we compare the minima obtained for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we find for @xmath40 a unit cell that has twice the area as that for @xmath39 and a value of @xmath14 that differs from that for @xmath39 by less than 3 parts in @xmath41 .",
    "we also find that @xmath8 , calculated by our method , is very accurate when compared with the known analytic expressions for @xmath42 and for @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.bhc ] for the @xmath44 curve , instead of the @xmath3 because @xmath45 .",
    "the errors seen in this figure indicate that our @xmath8 values differ from the theoretical ones by less than 1% .",
    "now we consider a superconductor with a cd - lattice .",
    "we assume that the cd radius is @xmath46 and that the cd - lattice is square with lattice constant @xmath47 .",
    "for films we assume that @xmath48 .",
    "first we look for the matching phase for which @xmath49 and the vll is square and commensurate with the cd - lattice , with one vortex - line pinned at each cd .",
    "we find that for both bulk and films with @xmath39 the matching phase minimizes @xmath14 in the range of @xmath2 values @xmath50 .",
    "we obtain for bulk @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and for films @xmath53 . when @xmath2 is just outside this range",
    "we find that a vll incommensurate with the cd - lattice minimizes @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath2-range for films is smaller than that for bulk due to the value of @xmath48 .",
    "we recall that by our method @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the boundaries in the @xmath3 phase diagram where the matching state becomes unstable with respect to an incommensurate triangular vll .",
    "we may ask what is the relationship between these boundaries and true ones obtained if @xmath14 were minimized without the restrictions imposed by our method . to answer this question it is necessary to guess the state to which the matching phase would become unstable to at these boundaries .",
    "one possibility is that the matching state becomes unstable with respect to the state obtained from it by the addition of vacancies or interstitials @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that at these boundaries a commensurate - incommensurate ( ci ) transition takes place @xcite .",
    "we believe that the former is possible only if the vortex - cd interaction is stronger than vortex - vortex interactions , which is not the case here . in our calculation the parameters are such that these two interactions are of comparable strength so , we believe , that the true boundaries here correspond to a ci transition .",
    "it is known that for strong vortex - vortex interactions , and not too close to the ci transition point , the incommensurate state differs from the triangular lattice by small incommensurate elastic distortions @xcite .",
    "thus , we believe that our method makes a reasonable approximation for the incommensurate state ( except close to the ci transition ) , and that the estimates obtained from it for the matching state phase boundaries are close to the true ones .    we also apply our method with @xmath40 a value of @xmath2 in the range @xmath50 .",
    "we find that the matching state with a rectangular unit cell twice as large as that for @xmath39 minimizes @xmath14 and that the @xmath14-value differs from that for @xmath39 by less than 1 part in @xmath56 .",
    "next we study vll commensurate with the cd - lattice for @xmath57 .",
    "these can be characterized as follows .",
    "we assume that the cd - lattice primitive unit cell is a square of side @xmath58 with unit vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 oriented along the sides .",
    "we expect that for these vll all vortex lines are pinned by the cd .",
    "thus , the vll primitive unit cell vectors , @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be written as @xmath63 if there are @xmath13 vortices in the unit cell , the magnetic induction in this state is @xmath64 where @xmath13 is restricted by @xmath65 .",
    "thus , when @xmath66 is rational , there are many non - equivalent vll satisfying the above stated conditions .",
    "we apply our numerical method to determine which one of these minimize @xmath14 , and to estimate the range of @xmath2 values over which this minimum is stable .",
    "we study @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 with @xmath39 and @xmath72 with @xmath40 .",
    "we find that for films the commensurate vll shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.vll ] minimize @xmath14 with @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath2 range where these minima are stable is around @xmath73 for which these vll minimize @xmath14 is less than @xmath74 . for bulk",
    "we find that for @xmath75 and @xmath70 the same vll minimize @xmath14 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2-range was not investigated in detail in this case .",
    "our results for @xmath78 and @xmath79 agree with recent lorentz microscopy experiments reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "in conclusion then we develop a numerical method to calculate the zero - temperature phase diagram of a bulk superconductor in the presence of an external field @xmath2 and show that it gives accurate results for the @xmath3 curve of an ideal superconductor and that it can make predictions about the zero - temperature phase diagram of the non - trivial problem of vortex lines in the presence of a cd - lattice .",
    "the method can be extended to study the zero - temperature phase diagram for anisotropic superconductors in tilted fields and to long cylinders of rectangular cross sections in axial fields .",
    "work along these lines is under way and will be reported elsewhere .",
