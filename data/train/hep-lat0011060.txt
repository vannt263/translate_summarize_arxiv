    "there is increasing experimental information on the n * spectrum from jlab and other accelerators , and the associated desire to understand it from first principles . given that state - of - the - art lattice qcd simulations have produced a ground - state spectrum that is very close to the observed values  @xcite , it is important to extend beyond the ground states . the rich structure of the n * spectrum  @xcite provides a fertile ground for exploring how the internal degrees of freedom in the nucleon are excited and how qcd works in a wider context .",
    "one outstanding example is the splitting pattern between the observed @xmath0 spectrum and its parity partner : the @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "the splittings are a direct manifestation of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of qcd , because without it qcd predicts parity doubling in the baryon spectrum .",
    "several lattice studies of the n * spectrum have appeared recently . in  @xcite the @xmath2 spectrum",
    "was first explored with a @xmath3 improved next - nearest - neighbor action . in  @xcite the splitting @xmath4 was examined with the domain - wall fermion action . in  @xcite results",
    "are reported for the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 based on the non - perturbative @xmath7 improved clover action .",
    "all the calculations show a clear splitting of the @xmath8 from the ground - state nucleon . in this work ,",
    "we report further calculations in the @xmath2 sectors using a highly - improved action on a anisotropic lattice .",
    "two independent , local interpolating fields coupling to the nucleon are considered : @xmath9 @xmath10 the interpolating fields for other members of the octet can be found by appropriate substitutions of quark fields  @xcite . despite having explicit positive - parity by construction , these interpolating fields couple to both positive and negative parity states .",
    "a parity projection is needed to separate the two . in the large euclidean time limit",
    ", the correlator with dirichlet boundary condition in the time direction and zero spatial momentum becomes @xmath11 @xmath12 the relative sign in front of @xmath13 provides the solution : taking the trace of g(t ) with @xmath14 respectively .",
    "a method on how to do the projection at finite momentum was also proposed in  @xcite which involves only diagonal elements .",
    "three types of correlators are considered in this work : two diagonal ones @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and the crossed @xmath17 .    the anisotropic gauge action of  @xcite , and the anisotropic d234 quark action of  @xcite are used .",
    "both have tadpole - improved tree - level coefficients .",
    "similar anisotropic actions have been used to study systems with heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "one advantage of anisotropic lattices is that with modest lattice sizes one can access large spatial volumes while having a fine temporal resolution , important when the states are extended and heavy . a @xmath18 lattice with @xmath19 fm and anisotropy @xmath20 is used .",
    "the tadpole factor from the plaquette mean link is @xmath21 while @xmath22 is set to 1 . in all",
    ", 500 configurations are analyzed .",
    "on each configuration 9 quark propagators are computed using a multi - mass solver , with quark masses ranging from approximately 780 to 90 mev .",
    "the corresponding mass ratio @xmath23 is from 0.93 to 0.60 .",
    "the source is located at the 2nd time slice .",
    "a gaussian - shaped , gauge - invariant smearing function  @xcite was applied at both the source and the sink to increase the overlap with the states in question .",
    "statistical errors are derived from a bootstrap procedure .",
    "figure  [ emass_nstar_sl ] shows some sample effective mass plots at quark mass no . 3 and 7 for all three correlators in the source - sink combination of sl which has the best signal among ll , ls , sl , ss .",
    "valid plateaus exist in all cases .",
    "figure  [ qm_n6.ps ] shows the extracted masses as a function of the quark mass .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 give roughly the same mass , while @xmath26 yields a consistently higher mass .",
    "it turns out that @xmath27 has very little overlap with the ground - state nucleon and couples mostly to the first excited state , the roper @xmath28 .",
    "this point will be clarified below .",
    "all three negative - parity correlators give consistent masses .",
    "the ordering of @xmath28 and @xmath29 at the quark masses considered is inverted compared to that from experiment .",
    "these results are consistent with those observed in  @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the ordering is reversed at smaller quark masses where meson cloud becomes more important .",
    "the crossing can be expected even in the quenched approximation where quarks wiggling backward in time provide part of the meson cloud .",
    "of course quenched qcd is sick at small quark masses , so a correct description must include the sea quarks .",
    "there is already evidence of such crossing at very small quark masses in the case of @xmath30 and @xmath31 mesons  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the meson cloud show up as non - analytic behavior in the quark mass .",
    "some curvature is already apparent in the data so a linear extrapolation is undesirable .    in order to make contact with experiment ,",
    "figure  [ ratio_nstar ] presents mass ratios of the @xmath1 states to the nucleon ground state as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "this way of presenting data has minimal dependence on the uncertainties in determining the scale and the quark masses .",
    "these ratios appear headed in the right direction compared to experiment .",
    "the @xmath33 deserves special attention since it requires a larger curvature . at present",
    "it is almost degenerate with @xmath29 while in the physical spectrum its mass is lower despite having a heavier strange quark .",
    "this has been a long - standing puzzle .",
    "the origin of the mass suppression of the @xmath33 lies in strong resonance channels such as the @xmath34 and @xmath35 which would present themselves as nonlinearities in the quark - mass extrapolation .",
    "whether it happens at smaller quark masses remains to be seen .    to extract information on the first excited states in each sector ,",
    "the 2 by 2 correlator matrix from the two interpolating fields is considered , using the variational method originally proposed in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ qm_one_n2 ] shows the results in the nucleon channel .",
    "it confirms that @xmath27 couples mostly to the the @xmath28 .",
    "the splitting of the roper @xmath28 from the nucleon is roughly 5 times that of the @xmath36 from the @xmath29 , consistent with experimental observations .",
    "this may be traced back to the structure of the interpolating fields used to excite the states .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath27 have upper spinor components of the order 1 and @xmath38 respectively , whereas the interpolating fields for 1/2- states , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , both have upper spinor components of the order @xmath41 which also introduce derivatives of the quark field operators . in the quark model ,",
    "the two nearby low - lying @xmath8 states of the physical spectrum are described by coupling three quarks to a spin-1/2 or spin-3/2 spin - flavor wave function coupled in turn to one unit of orbital angular momentum . in a relativistic field theory one does not expect @xmath42 and @xmath43 to isolate individual states .",
    "however , it is expected that @xmath42 will predominantly excite the lower - lying @xmath44 state associated with @xmath45 and @xmath46 while @xmath43 will predominantly excite the higher - lying state associated with @xmath47 .",
    "this expectation is borne out in the variational analysis .",
    "the results should improve with a larger basis of interpolating fields .",
    "an independent method based on maximum entropy  @xcite is being applied to verify the results .",
    "the potential of anisotropic lattices , smeared operators and correlator matrix is demonstrated in probing the low - lying n*s in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 sectors .",
    "the pattern of the splittings is mostly consistent with experiment .",
    "more definite comparisons should address the systematics : finite @xmath48 , finite volume , statistics , and most importantly , the chiral limit .",
    "there are still unresolved issues , such as the inverted ordering of the @xmath28 and the @xmath29 , and the degeneracy of the @xmath33 and the @xmath29 at present quark masses , that depend on this limit .",
    "one way to proceed is to use chpt to extrapolate the lattice data at quark masses where the quenched approximation is benign , like that proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the more desirable way is to be able to simulate directly at or near the physical quark masses . toward this end , good chiral properties are essential , and the domain - wall and the overlap quarks  @xcite",
    "seem to hold the promise .",
