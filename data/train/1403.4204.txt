    "since bender and co - workers seminal work on non - hermitian hamiltonians a decade and a half ago , there has been tremendous progress in the field of parity and time - reversal ( @xmath0- ) symmetric quantum theory  @xcite . for continuum , @xmath0-symmetric , non - hermitian hamiltonians on an infinite line",
    ", they showed that the eigenvalue spectrum is purely real when the strength of the `` non - hermiticity '' is small , and becomes complex when it is large .",
    "traditionally , the region of the parameter space where the eigenvalues of the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian are purely real , @xmath5 , and the eigenfunctions are simultaneous eigenfunctions of the combined @xmath0-operation , @xmath6 , is called the @xmath0-symmetric region . in the early years",
    ", significant theoretical progress was made towards the development of a self - consistent quantum theory via a hamiltonian - dependent inner product , under which the eigenfunctions become orthonormal in the @xmath0-symmetric phase  @xcite .",
    "this progress was accompanied by mathematical advances in the field of pseudohermitian operators - operators that are not hermitian under the standard inner product , but may be self - adjoint under an appropriately defined metric  @xcite .",
    "most of these investigations were focused on continuum hamiltonians on an infinite line .    during the past five years ,",
    "discrete @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians on finite lattices and continuum @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians on a finite line have been extensively studied due to their experimental relevance .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry breaking is a _ non - perturbative phenomenon _ that occurs when the strength of the non - hermitian potential is equal to the relevant hermitian energy scale .",
    "a perturbation - theory characterization of the @xmath0-symmetry breaking criterion was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed that the eigenvalues of a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath7 remain real when the strength @xmath8 of the non - hermitian potential @xmath9 is smaller than the radius of convergence @xmath10 for the perturbation expansion ; this radius is determined by the hermitian piece @xmath11 .",
    "it also demonstrated that coupled optical waveguides with balanced loss and gain provide an ideal candidate to visualize the effects of approaching the @xmath0-breaking transition  @xcite . since then",
    ", it has become clear that @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians naturally arise as `` effective hamiltonians '' for open systems with balanced loss and gain , and @xmath0-symmetry breaking experimentally manifests as a transition from a quasiequilibrium state to a state with broken reciprocity .",
    "experimental demonstrations of @xmath0-symmetry breaking in optics  @xcite , and the natural emergence of @xmath0-symmetric effective potentials in driven condensed matter systems  @xcite have complemented theoretical studies of @xmath0-symmetry breaking in lattice models  @xcite and continuum models on a finite line  @xcite .",
    "special attention has been paid to the number of eigenvalues that become complex  @xcite , their location in the energy spectrum  @xcite , the extended or localized nature of the corresponding eigenstates  @xcite , and the experimental consequences of the spatial extent of the states that break the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "a salient difference between the lattice and continuum models is as follows . in all cases , continuum models on a finite line",
    "have shown a positive @xmath0-symmetry breaking threshold  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , most lattice models have shown a vanishing @xmath0-symmetry breaking threshold that goes to zero as the number of lattice sites @xmath12 diverges  @xcite .",
    "this remarkable discrepancy suggests that understanding the differences between lattice and continuum models is crucial for a detailed understanding of the @xmath0-symmetry breaking phenomenon , particularly because all of its realizations have been in small lattices with @xmath13 sites .    here",
    ", we investigate @xmath0-symmetry breaking in @xmath12-site lattices with extended loss - gain potentials characterized by strength @xmath14 and parameter @xmath15 , and their continuum counterparts on a finite segment . the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present the tight - binding model , and discuss the results for the @xmath0-symmetric threshold @xmath16 on the lattice and their continuum implications .",
    "in particular , we show that some divergent continuum potentials on a finite segment have a positive @xmath0-symmetry breaking threshold . in sec .",
    "[ sec : psi ] we discuss the signatures of @xmath0-symmetry breaking in such lattices , and show that they are consistent with the expectations based on the extended nature of @xmath0-broken eigenstates . in sec .",
    "[ sec : loc ] we show that localized states with complex energies within the lattice energy band emerge at much larger loss - gain strength @xmath17 , and discuss their significance .",
    "we conclude the paper with sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] .",
    "consider an @xmath12-site tight - binding lattice with site - to - site distance @xmath18 and nearest - neighbor tunneling @xmath19 .",
    "its hermitian tunneling hamiltonian is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a state @xmath22 localized at site @xmath23 .",
    "we keep coupled optical waveguides in mind for an experimental realization of this lattice ; thus , @xmath24 represents the creation operator for the single - mode electric field in the waveguide @xmath25 .",
    "the parity operator on an open lattice is given by @xmath26 where site @xmath27 is the parity - symmetric counterpart of site @xmath28 .",
    "the action of the time - reversal ( or motion - reversal ) operator is @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the hamiltonian eq.([eq : tunneling ] ) represents a lattice with open boundaries , and thus its eigenfunctions @xmath30 satisfy the constraint @xmath31 . in the continuum limit , this boundary condition translates into dirichlet boundary condition with a vanishing wave function .",
    "the spectrum of the tight - binding model is given by @xmath32 , and the corresponding extended , normalized eigenfunctions consistent with the open boundary condition are @xmath33 . here",
    "@xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "note that the spectrum is symmetric about zero , @xmath36 , the eigenfunctions have equal weights on parity - symmetric sites , and the eigenstates at energies @xmath37 are related by @xmath38 .",
    "these symmetries of the spectrum and eigenfunctions remain valid in the presence of pure loss - gain potentials in the @xmath0-symmetric region  @xcite .",
    "we consider a class of extended loss - gain potentials parameterized by @xmath15 , @xmath39 here , @xmath14 is the strength of the potential and @xmath40 is the lattice center . with the present convention ,",
    "the first half of the lattice , @xmath41 , is the `` loss region '' and the second half of the lattice , @xmath42 , is the `` gain region '' . in coupled optical waveguides , such a potential",
    "is implemented by a site - dependent complex index of refraction @xmath43 with a symmetric real part , @xmath44 , and an antisymmetric imaginary part , @xmath45 .",
    "at this point , we remind the reader that extended potentials on a lattice , eq.([eq : alpha ] ) , were investigated and deemed unstable due to the vanishing @xmath0-symmetric threshold that is obtained in the limit @xmath46  @xcite .    the continuum limit of this problem is defined by @xmath47 and @xmath48 in such a manner that @xmath49 defines the length of the finite segment and @xmath50 defines the mass of the non - relativistic quantum particle confined in this segment . with this notation",
    ", it follows that the continuum potential becomes @xmath51 where the potential strength @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 note that the continuum potential eq.([eq : calpha ] ) is not analytic at @xmath54 except when @xmath15 is an odd integer .",
    "then , for @xmath55 , @xmath56 reduces to cases considered in earlier investigations  @xcite , although none of those works consider divergent potentials @xmath4 .",
    "the continuum problem corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath57 is given by the schrdinger equation @xmath58 subject to boundary conditions @xmath59 .",
    "at this point , we remind the reader that a positive @xmath0-breaking threshold was found for the spectrum of eq.([eq : schr ] ) when @xmath60  @xcite , @xmath61  @xcite , and @xmath62  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will resolve this apparent discrepancy between the lattice and continuum results .",
    "since the spectrum of the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath63 can not be obtained analytically , we numerically obtain the threshold @xmath16 below which all eigenvalues of the discrete @xmath64 hamiltonian are purely real .",
    "the left - hand panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptphase ] shows the dependence of the threshold on the lattice size . we see that @xmath65 decreases in a power - law fashion as @xmath12 increases , and that the power - law exponent is determined by @xmath2 .",
    "thus , for @xmath2 , the @xmath0-symmetric threshold vanishes with increasing @xmath12 and the resultant @xmath0-symmetric phase is fragile  @xcite , but in a very specific manner , @xmath66 for @xmath46 .",
    "it follows from eqs.([eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : trend ] ) that the dimensionless continuum threshold for @xmath56 is equal to the power - law prefactor , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the continuum energy scale for a particle on a finite segment .",
    "this continuum threshold @xmath69 , obtained from the scaling data , is shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ptphase ] .",
    "it shows that @xmath69 is a positive , monotonically increasing function of @xmath15 that goes to zero as @xmath70 .",
    "these results imply that , surprisingly , _",
    "divergent potentials including @xmath71 have a positive , finite @xmath0- breaking threshold . _    when @xmath3 , we find that the numerically obtained lattice threshold @xmath72 is independent of the lattice size @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding continuum threshold obtained via eq.([eq : cont ] ) vanishes , @xmath73 .    to quantify the applicability of the scaling proposed in eq.([eq : trend ] ) to finite lattices , in table  [ table : alpha ] we list the mean value of @xmath74 and its variance obtained from the size - dependent @xmath16 for lattice sizes varying in steps of 200 from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "we see that for @xmath77 , the variance in @xmath74 is less than 1% of its mean value ; for @xmath78 , the variance is larger , but only due to finite - size effects that become dominant as the exponent @xmath79 when @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the scaling trend postulated in eq.([eq : trend ] ) holds well down to @xmath81 few hundred . the second column in table  [ table : alpha ]",
    "also indicates that when @xmath82 , the mean @xmath74 exactly matches the continuum threshold results obtained in the literature .",
    ".the mean and variance of @xmath74 obtained from vanishing lattice thresholds @xmath65 with @xmath83 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptphase ] and table  [ table : alpha ] reconcile the nonzero @xmath0-threshold , i.e. @xmath84 , in a continuum model with a vanishing @xmath0-threshold , i.e. @xmath85 , in the corresponding lattice model .",
    "the existence of a positive continuum threshold , particularly for @xmath86 , follows from perturbation theory .",
    "the spectrum of the hermitian hamiltonian @xmath11 is given by @xmath87 and has a finite minimum gap .",
    "@xmath0-symmetry breaking is preceded by the closing of the _ finite gap between adjacent eigenvalues _",
    ", which , in turn requires a finite strength of the non - hermitian potential  @xcite .",
    "this finite threshold mandates , via eq.([eq : gamma ] ) , that the corresponding lattice - model threshold @xmath88 must vanish algebraically with increasing lattice size .",
    "these findings are not surprising for @xmath86 , when the continuum potential @xmath56 is bounded over the entire line .",
    "however , our analysis also predicts that divergent @xmath0-potentials , too , have a positive threshold when @xmath89 .",
    "( such potentials have not been investigated in the literature . ) in the following section , we investigate the signatures of @xmath0 symmetry breaking in such potentials .",
    "the lattice hamiltonian @xmath90 can be realized in an array of coupled optical waveguides .",
    "the tunneling @xmath91 is determined by the waveguide cross - section and the distance between adjacent waveguides .",
    "it is easily tuned with present - day technology  @xcite , as is the loss potential in the first half of the lattice , @xmath41 , engineered via the imaginary part of the index of refraction .",
    "the fabrication of an extended , position - dependent gain potential has not yet been experimentally demonstrated , although it may be relatively straightforward to implement in the discrete parity - time synthetic lattices  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we present the signatures of @xmath0-symmetry breaking in the time - evolution of an initially normalized wave packet , and discuss their relationship with the spatial structure of the @xmath0-broken eigenfunctions .",
    "since @xmath90 is a single - particle , time - independent hamiltonian , it is straightforward to obtain the time - evolved state @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the non - unitary time evolution operator .",
    "the site - and time - dependent intensity is then obtained as @xmath94 , and the total intensity @xmath95 is not conserved . note that since the finite - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath96 is diagonalizable for @xmath97 , the net intensity @xmath98 oscillates but remains bounded when @xmath99 and increases exponentially with time at long times when @xmath100 . at the @xmath0-breaking point ,",
    "the hamiltonian is defective , and can be reduced to a jordan canonical form with at least one non - trivial jordan block .",
    "therefore , at long times , the net intensity scales as a power - law , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the dimension of the nontrivial jordan block corresponding to the @xmath0-breaking , degenerate eigenvalue ; at shorter times , the intensity @xmath98 is a polynomial of order @xmath103 whose exact form is determined by the hamiltonian at the exceptional point @xmath104 .",
    "thus , for any finite lattice , at the @xmath0-breaking threshold , _ the net intensity at long times scales as an even power of time _ or , equivalently , the distance along the waveguide .",
    "we will see in the next section that the relevant time - scale that codifies `` long time '' is crucially determined by the extended vs. localized nature of eigenfunctions with complex energies .",
    "we use an initial state centered at lattice site @xmath105 , @xmath106 where @xmath107 $ ] ensures that the state is normalized .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : psitime ] are for @xmath108 and @xmath109 , but one obtains _ qualitatively similar results _ for broad wave packets centered at arbitrary locations . the left - hand column in fig .",
    "[ fig : psitime ] shows the site- and time - dependent intensity for @xmath110 ( top panel ) , @xmath60 ( center panel ) , and @xmath111 ( bottom panel ) . in each case , the @xmath0-potential strength is just below the threshold , @xmath112 , the unit of time is given by @xmath113 where the average level spacing is @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "we have chosen the time - range @xmath116 to cover one bounded intensity oscillation .",
    "the top panel shows that when @xmath110 , the wave packet undergoes amplification near the center of the lattice .",
    "the region of maximal intensity is spread out broadly for @xmath60 ( center panel ) , whereas when @xmath111 , the maximum amplification does not occur near the center of the lattice . in each case",
    "maximum site - intensity in the loss region , @xmath41 , lags the maximum site - intensity in the gain region , @xmath42 .",
    "the right - hand column shows that just above the threshold , @xmath117 , the intensity profile monotonically increases with time , but retains an identical @xmath15-dependence .",
    "these intensity profiles have two surprising features .",
    "the first is that the amplification in the gain region is faithfully transferred to the loss region .",
    "thus , the lag between the intensity maxima is the primary distinguisher between gain and loss regions .",
    "the second is that the maximum site intensity _ does not occur in the region of maximum gain potential .",
    "_ when @xmath55 , the loss - gain potential maxima occur at the two ends of the lattice and the intensity maxima from the non - unitary time evolution are concentrated near the center .",
    "when @xmath4 , the loss - gain maxima occur at the center of the lattice , whereas the intensity maxima are displaced outward .",
    "this counterintuitive behavior is understood by focusing on the eigenfunctions that break the @xmath0-symmetry and dominate the non - unitary time evolution . at @xmath118 , the ground state wave function @xmath119 , and the excited state wave function @xmath120 are orthogonal . as @xmath121 ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath8-dependent eigenfunctions become degenerate , and show a maximum at the center of the lattice for @xmath55 and a dip at the center of the lattice for @xmath4 . indeed , at long times , the intensity profile @xmath122 is determined by the intensity profile of these eigenfunctions and is therefore ( mostly ) independent of the choice of the initial state @xmath123 .    for all potentials",
    "@xmath124 considered in this paper , the @xmath0-symmetry is first broken via the ground - state and first - excited - state eigenfunctions that are extended over the entire lattice .",
    "when the potential strength exceeds the fragile threshold @xmath125 and continues to increase , generically , the fraction of eigenvalues that become degenerate and then complex increases , and the corresponding extended eigenfunctions become @xmath0 asymmetric  @xcite . in the following section , we will investigate the emergence of _ localized states with complex energies _ at loss - gain potential strengths comparable to the lattice bandwidth , @xmath126 .",
    "the discrete spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath11 is bounded by @xmath127 and becomes a continuous band when the lattice is infinite .",
    "a remarkable property of the hamiltonian @xmath90 is that , no matter how `` strong '' the loss - gain potential is , the real part of the energy spectrum of @xmath90 remains confined to this band while the imaginary part of complex energies increases with the loss - gain strength for @xmath128 . just as bound states occur in the presence of a hermitian potential , they do in the presence of a non - hermitian , @xmath0-symmetric potential when its strength @xmath8 exceeds a threshold @xmath129 . the crucial difference in the latter case , though , is that the ( real part of ) energy of such localized states lies in the band @xmath127 .",
    "it is possible to analytically obtain the threshold @xmath129 for a single pair of @xmath0 impurities in an infinite lattice  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case with extended potentials @xmath130 , we locate this threshold numerically .     for an infinite lattice , obtained from lattice sizes @xmath12=100 - 4000 .",
    "there are no localized states for a positive @xmath15 .",

    "the inset shows the emergence of a localized eigenstate for @xmath111 with @xmath133 .",
    "an extended eigenstate at @xmath134 ( red solid or dashed line ) becomes localized past the threshold , @xmath135 ( blue solid or dashed line ) .",
    "the vertical axis in the inset is the eigenstate site intensity . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : loc ] shows the bound - state threshold @xmath136 for an infinite lattice , obtained from the data for lattice sizes ranging from @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",
    "when @xmath55 , the potential does not have any bound states .",
    "as @xmath15 decreases , the potential deepens near the center and bound states localized near the lattice - center emerge .",
    "we find that the requisite threshold @xmath136 decreases monotonically with decreasing @xmath139 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that for large , negative @xmath15 , the potential is concentrated near the lattice center , and therefore the threshold strength necessary to support a bound state is lowered .",
    "when @xmath140 , the cumulative gain @xmath141 diverges as @xmath142 for any value of @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the threshold strength @xmath143 required for a bound state vanishes in this limit .",
    "we emphasize that the bound - state threshold value is much larger than the @xmath0-symmetry breaking threshold for the same lattice , @xmath144 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : loc ] shows the emergence of a bound state at @xmath111 , when the bound - state threshold is @xmath145 .",
    "the horizontal axis represents fractional location along the lattice , and the vertical axis denotes the site intensity ; the solid lines represent results for @xmath75 and the dashed lines correspond to the @xmath146 case . when @xmath134 , the eigenstate site - intensity is nonzero over the entire gain region .",
    "( the eigenstate with the complex - conjugate energy has site - intensity that is nonzero over the entire loss region . )",
    "as is expected for an extended state , when the lattice size is doubled from @xmath75 ( red solid line ) to @xmath146 ( red dashed line ) the site intensity is reduced by a factor of two .",
    "this changes dramatically as @xmath8 crosses the bound - state threshold . at @xmath135 ,",
    "the corresponding eigenstate now becomes localized near the lattice center in the gain region .",
    "we note that in contrast to the extended state , the localized state site - intensity profiles for @xmath75 ( blue solid line ) and @xmath146 ( blue dashed line ) have the same height , and the fractional width of the profile is halved as @xmath12 is doubled .",

    "lastly , we demonstrate the dramatic effect of the emergence of a localized state with complex energy on the time - scale that determines the `` long - time '' behavior of net intensity @xmath98 in the @xmath0-symmetry broken phase .",
