    "one of the observational facts that needs new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) @xcite , @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the baryon number ( entropy ) density .",
    "although many mechanisms that can explain the observed value exist in the literature , electroweak baryogenesis ( ewbg ) @xcite is the only scenario that is ripe for verification by collider experiments , such as the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , and by low energy experiments , such as the electric dipole moments of the neutron , atoms and molecules . since ewbg is intimately connected to higgs physics , the establishment of the higgs sector plays an essential role in testing it , and the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc in 2012 @xcite is the first step toward the collider probe of ewbg . indeed , since the higgs boson mass that is one of the relevant parameters for the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) has been measured with 0.2% accuracy , @xmath5 gev  @xcite , the feasible regions of ewbg have been narrowed down in various models  @xcite . in upcoming experiments , such as the lhc run - ii and the high - luminosity lhc  @xcite , the higgs boson couplings to the sm particles would be measured with better precision , and the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite has the great capability of measuring the triple higgs boson coupling , which may yield a decisive clue to the ewbg hypothesis .    in order for ewbg to be successful , the ewpt has to be strongly first order .",
    "the properties of the ewpt are related not only to the higgs boson mass and model parameters but also to electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms .",
    "an interesting possibility is the so - called coleman - weinberg ( cw ) mechanism  @xcite in which quantum effects induce the symmetry breaking .",
    "the scale invariant two higgs doublet model ( si-2hdm )  @xcite is one of such examples , and the previous work @xcite shows that the si-2hdm can have the strong first - order ewpt . at the time of their analysis",
    ", however , the masses of the higgs boson and top quark were not known . moreover , on the theoretical front , neither a thermal resummation for the effective potential nor the evaluation of a baryon number preservation condition ( also called a sphaleron decoupling condition ) were conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this letter",
    ", we update the analysis of the ewpt including the evaluation of bubble wall profiles , and obtain the sphaleron decoupling condition by taking the recent lhc data into account . in our study , we use the finite - temperature one - loop effective potential with daisy resummation .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of the sphaleron decoupling condition is also briefly discussed .",
    "as studied in the previous works  @xcite , we evaluate the deviations of the higgs boson couplings from their sm values in the region where the strong first - order ewpt is achieved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we give a quick review of the si-2hdm in section  [ sec : model ] , and the higgs boson couplings are presented in section [ sec : higgs ] .",
    "the sphaleron decoupling condition and the critical bubbles are discussed in section [ sec : sph_cb ] .",
    "we show our results in section [ sec : results ] , and conclusions and discussions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the si-2hdm is a minimal scale invariant extension of the sm by adding another higgs doublet field .",
    "the most general higgs potential at the renormalizable level is given by @xmath6 after two higgs doublets get vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , they are cast into the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 gev . in order to avoid higgs - mediated flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes at the tree level , we impose a @xmath12 symmetry ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , which leads to @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the phase of @xmath16 is removed by an appropriate field redefinition of the higgs doublets , so that cp is conserved .    following a method by gildener and weinberg  @xcite",
    ", we consider the ew symmetry breaking in a flat direction .",
    "the tree - level effective potential takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the constant background fields of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the tadpole conditions that are defined as the first derivatives of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath21 give the following conditions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "with these conditions , it follows that @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , since the mass matrix of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is written as @xmath27 one finds @xmath28 using eq .",
    "( [ tadpole ] ) .",
    "the appearance of the massless particle is the consequence of the classical scale invariance .",
    "we define @xmath29 and @xmath30 as the mass eigenstates of the cp - even higgs bosons , which are obtained by @xmath31 where @xmath32 . in the following discussion",
    ", @xmath29 is the sm - like higgs boson whose mass is zero at the tree level and is generated by the quantum corrections .",
    "it can be proved that @xmath33 at the tree level , and consequently , the higgs boson couplings to the gauge bosons and fermions are the same as those in the sm .    as mentioned above , @xmath29 becomes massive as the result of the radiative ew symmetry breaking .",
    "the one - loop effective potential is  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 for scalars and fermions ( gauge bosons ) and @xmath38 denotes a renormalization scale . @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the physical cp - odd and charged higgs bosons , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 are the degrees of freedom and the statistics of the particle @xmath42 : @xmath43 the field - dependent masses can be written as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 are the corresponding masses in the vacuum , so that @xmath46 is reduced to @xmath47 with @xmath48 as can be seen from the tadpole condition of @xmath46 , we have a relationship between the scale of @xmath49 and the renormalization scale @xmath38 , i.e. , @xmath50 , as the consequence of dimensional transmutation . from eqs .",
    "( [ v1 ] ) and ( [ a_b ] ) , it is easily checked that the vacuum energy becomes @xmath51 , which implies that the electroweak symmetry is broken unless @xmath52 is negative .",
    "it should be noted that since @xmath39 and @xmath52 are the same order in the coupling , i.e. , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 collectively denotes the coupling constants in this model , @xmath55 should be @xmath56 , so the @xmath57 . in other directions , however , @xmath39 may be @xmath58 and thus @xmath59 , which may invalidate the perturbative calculation , as advocated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the mass of @xmath29 is obtained by taking the second derivative of @xmath46 and evaluating it at @xmath60 , @xmath61 we remark that thanks to the loop contributions from @xmath62 and @xmath40 , @xmath52 can be positive in contrast to the sm case , rendering @xmath63 positive .",
    "interestingly , once @xmath64 is fixed , the possible ranges of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are restricted . in this letter",
    ", we consider a case that @xmath67 in order to satisfy the constraint coming from the @xmath68 parameter  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the heavy higgs mass scales are specified by only two parameters . in what follows ,",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are chosen .",
    "the higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons and fermions normalized to the sm values are , respectively , given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 as discussed in section ii , @xmath73 due to @xmath33 at the tree level .",
    "even in such a situation , the so - called nondecoupling effects may appear in the loop processes .",
    "for instance , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath74 mode may be significantly modified by the charged higgs boson loop .",
    "the higgs signal strength of @xmath74 is defined as @xmath75 where @xmath76  @xcite and @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is a loop function defined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the another nondecoupling effect may appear in the triple higgs boson coupling .",
    "the deviation of the triple higgs boson coupling from its sm value is defined as @xmath80 in this analysis , we use the following expression as the sm prediction  @xcite @xmath81 . \\ ] ] note that the dominant one - loop contribution comes from the top quark loop , which renders @xmath82 smaller compared to the leading result . in the si-2hdm , the triple higgs boson coupling to leading order is simply expressed in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath49  @xcite @xmath84 unlike the ordinary 2hdm , the leading result in the si-2hdm does not same as the leading one in the sm even in the case that @xmath85 , which reflects the different origins of the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "in ewbg , in order to preserve the generated bau until today , the sphaleron process must be decoupled right after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "this condition ( the so - called sphaleron decoupling condition ) is given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the baryon number changing rate in the broken phase , and @xmath88 is the hubble constant .",

    "only bubble that has some critical size , which is called the critical bubble , can grow .",
    "the ewpt proceeds to develop if the bubble nucleation rate is larger than a certain value , and then the universe is finally filled with the broken phase .",

    "let us briefly make a comparison between the si-2hdm and the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) . unlike the si-2hdm ,",
    "the supercooling in the mssm case is rather small , e.g. , @xmath157 @xcite , and the bubble wall width in the si-2hdm is thinner than that in the mssm , which is due to the stronger first - order ewpt compared to the mssm case .",
    "since a cp violating source term may be proportional to the gradient of the bubble wall  @xcite , the baryon number generation may be more efficient than the mssm case .",

    "it was found that even though the higgs boson couplings to the gauge bosons and fermions are sm like , the significant deviations may appear in the @xmath74 mode and the triple higgs boson coupling due to the nondecoupling effects of the heavy higgs boson loops . in our benchmark point ,",

    "<S> it is found that the 125 gev higgs boson inevitably leads to the strong first - order electroweak phase transition , and the strength of which is always large enough to satisfy the sphaleron decoupling condition , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes a nucleation temperature and @xmath2 is the higgs vacuum expectation value at @xmath1 . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> even if the higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons and fermions are similar to the standard model values , the signal strength of the higgs decay to two photons is reduced by 10% and the triple higgs boson coupling is enhanced by 82% compared to the standard model prediction . </S>"
