    "the einstein - scalar field system , whose rigorous study was initiated in  @xcite , is of course a special case , where the maxwell part vanishes .",
    "the results of this paper also apply in the case where the wave equation is decoupled from the einstein equations . for more on the relationship between these two problems ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "recall that the quotient manifold @xmath7 inherits a @xmath8-dimensional lorentzian metric , which in null coordinates takes the form @xmath9 .",
    "the metric of @xmath10 can then be written @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the standard metric on @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the area radius function @xmath15 defined by @xmath16 .",
    "we recall the hawking mass @xmath17 , and the mass aspect function @xmath18 . under spherical symmetry , the maxwell equations decouple , contributing a @xmath19 term to the energy momentum tensor , where @xmath20 is a constant . defining the `` renormalized '' hawking mass @xmath21 , the evolution of the metric and scalar field",

    "we will assume the existence of a spacetime bounded by an ingoing null curve , a timelike curve , and an outgoing null curve , which we will call the _ event horizon_. at @xmath32 , even though @xmath33 is part of the spacetime . ] certain conditions will be imposed on the initial ingoing null curve and the timelike boundary . in this paper , we will not concern ourselves with the explicit _ construction _ of solutions satisfying the conditions described here , although this can be accomplished easily enough using the methods of  @xcite .",
    "we consider a spacetime @xmath34 with penrose diagram depicted below , where @xmath35 is a timelike boundary : @xmath36 here , @xmath37 , but @xmath38 .",
    "the point of intersection of the initial ingoing ray and @xmath35 will be @xmath39",
    ". the ingoing ray will then be the curve @xmath40 .",
    "the equations @xmath41@xmath42 are assumed to hold pointwise . on @xmath35 , @xmath43 , @xmath6 for some constant @xmath4 , and @xmath44 will be non - increasing as a function of @xmath1 , such that @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath1 ranges in all of @xmath46 . on the ingoing null segment @xmath40 ,",
    "we assume @xmath47 , @xmath48 bounded , @xmath49 .",
    "this makes @xmath50 for some @xmath51 .",

    "we first show    under the above assumptions , @xmath54 in @xmath34 , and @xmath55 in @xmath56 .",

    ", @xmath57 is an open subset of @xmath34 . in @xmath64 , we clearly have @xmath65 , and @xmath66 in @xmath67 .",

    ", if @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , then @xmath71 for all @xmath72 , and thus the curve @xmath73 can not intersect @xmath35 .. see  @xcite ] thus , by @xmath74 , we have @xmath75 in @xmath76 , and so , denoting @xmath77}\\varpi(u,1)$ ] we have @xmath78 in @xmath79 . integrating @xmath80 from @xmath40 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath81 . from @xmath82",
    ", we have @xmath83 integrating @xmath60 , it follows that @xmath84 on @xmath79 .",
    "thus @xmath85 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we note now that from the above proposition and the results of  @xcite , it follows that @xmath87 , @xmath88 in @xmath34 , and thus , since @xmath89 , we have @xmath52 throughout @xmath34 .",
    "this immediately yields @xmath90 where we use the fact that @xmath91 and @xmath92 have the same sign to obtain the lower bound .",
    "we will show the following                the above two propositions and the archimedean property of the real numbers immediately yield the theorem .",
    "_ proof of proposition 2_. we note that proposition 1 gives all the information necessary to apply section 5 of  @xcite .",

    "_ proof of proposition 3_. consider a dyadic decomposition of the event horizon , with respect to the @xmath1 coordinate , as in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath103 in each dyadic interval , we can select , again as in  @xcite , a subinterval @xmath104 , split into two pieces as shown below , each of length @xmath105 , @xmath106 such that @xmath107 here @xmath1 denotes the @xmath1-value of any point in the dyadic interval .",
    "( recall that these values are all comparable to the length of the dyadic interval . ) we note that the assumptions of propositions of section 6 of  @xcite hold .",
    "we thus obtain the bound @xmath108 on the interval @xmath109 .",
    "it follows immediately , in view of the bounds @xmath110 , and @xmath111 that , @xmath112 now , by the inequalities @xmath75 , @xmath113 , the fact that @xmath44 is nonincreasing to the future along @xmath35 , and the equation @xmath74 , this implies immediately @xmath114 along the event horizon . by the dyadic nature of the decomposition",
    ", @xmath115 holds for all values of @xmath1 , and not just for the @xmath1-values of the future endpoints of @xmath104 .",
    "finally , by @xmath116 , this proves immediately @xmath117 . applying again the results of section 6 of  @xcite ,",
    "now with _ any _ subinterval of the event horizon of length @xmath118 , in view of @xmath117 , we obtain that the inequality @xmath119 holds throughout @xmath34 , in particular , on @xmath35 .",
    "the boundary conditions , namely @xmath43 , @xmath120 , @xmath44 is non - increasing on @xmath35 , yield that @xmath121 on @xmath35 , and thus by @xmath122 we have @xmath123 on @xmath35 .",
    "integrating now the equation @xmath124 from @xmath35 , in view of the bounds @xmath111 , @xmath116 , and @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath125 throughout @xmath34 .",
