    "about twenty years have passed since the first discovery of exoplanets using the radial velocity method @xcite .",
    "now the radial velocity surveys reach long - period exoplanets around and beyond the snow line , including jupiter - analogues around sun - like stars . how do we further characterize those cool gas and ice giants ?",
    "while direct imaging is a promising approach to characterize them in near future ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , transiting long - period giant planets ( lpgs ) , on which the present paper focuses , are also important for probing the planetary system architecture beyond the snow line . indeed , detailed information on the system architecture , including the statistical properties of resonance and the mutual orbital inclination , has already been obtained for the compact multi - transiting systems ( orbital periods @xmath4 ) discovered by the _ kepler",
    "_ spacecraft .",
    "transiting lpgs will also provide the opportunity to characterize both the interior structure and atmospheric compositions of the cool giant planets with transmission spectroscopy , as already demonstrated for the solar - system planets .",
    "for example , the observed transmission spectra of jupiter @xcite and saturn @xcite exhibit clear features of atmospheric molecules such as methane .    despite their importance , it is extremely challenging to find the transiting lpgs at all .",
    "since the transit probability of lpgs is quite low ( @xmath5 ) , it is hopeless to search for them in the sample of lpgs characterized with radial velocities ( rvs ) . even utilizing the space - mission data as obtained by _ kepler _ , transiting lpgs can hardly be detected with the usual periodicity analysis because their orbital periods are typically beyond the mission lifetime .",
    "nevertheless , they can still be detected through the single transit events ( stes ) , which occur only once in the @xmath6-year observational span and thus may have been missed by the pipeline .    in this paper , we perform a uniform search for the stes in the _ kepler _ data by visual inspection and report on the discovery of seven candidates of transiting lpgs .",
    "we focus on the targets with already known transit signals ( i.e. _ kepler _ objects of interest , kois ) mainly for the two reasons .",
    "first , it is more likely to find transiting lpgs for those systems because the orbital planes of lpgs are presumably aligned with those of the inner planets , at least , to some extent .",
    "second , we can estimate the orbital periods of those transiting lpgs even from the single transit , if found , by fitting their light curves simultaneously with those of the inner planets .",
    "we will demonstrate that such an estimate is indeed possible and also useful for discussing the system architecture .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . ",
    "[ sec : ste ] presents the methods for finding the stes and the analysis for estimating their geometric parameters , especially the orbital period .",
    " [ sec : individual ] describes the features of the individual stes in more detail , and classifies them based on the likelihood to be genuine planets .",
    "implications of our finding for the statistical property of lpgs are also briefly discussed in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "let us first summarize the stes we identified before the detailed description of the analysis .",
    "table [ tab : list ] reports 28 stes we identified in 24 kois .",
    "we analyzed 16 ste light curves in 14 of those systems that are not the clear false positives and estimated the parameters including the orbital period and radius ratio ( table [ tab : list_fit ] ) .",
    "as a result , we found seven systems exhibiting stes consistent with the planetary transit (  3 in detail ) ; their orbital architectures are illustrated in figure [ fig : sum ] . in this section , we describe the details of the ste identification (  2.1 ) and light - curve analyses (  2.2 ) .",
    "we analyzed the long cadence fluxes of the pre - search data conditioning component of the _ kepler _ pipeline ( pdcsap ) of 7557 kois , which were available on the nasa exoplanet archive at the time of june 4th , 2015 .",
    "we searched for stes by visual inspection of all those pdcsap fluxes and identified 28 stes in 24 kois as shown in table [ tab : list ] . here the fading events that are not observed in the sap data but only seen in the pdcsap data are excluded because we find that the correction by the pdc pipeline sometimes leads to artificial dips in the light curves .",
    ", which does not exist in the sap data . ]",
    "although it is admittedly difficult to quantify the detection limit of our visual inspection , we believe that transits deeper than @xmath5 and lasting longer than @xmath7 hours have been detected .",
    "among the 28 stes in table [ tab : list ] , 14 have never been reported in the literature ; they are marked with ",
    "new \" in the parentheses .",
    "koi numbers designated by the _ kepler _",
    "team are listed for the other seven events . when more than one stes are found in one system ,",
    "they are reported separately ( two in koi-847 , koi-1168 , and koi-6378 ; three in koi-1032 ) .      to further characterize the planet candidates causing stes ( hereafter  ste candidates \" ) , we fit the ste light curves assuming that ste candidates are not due to contamination but orbiting the kois for which we found stes on circular orbits .",
    "as discussed below , this assumption allows us to estimate orbital periods of the ste candidates even from only one transit .",
    "here we exclude the systems designated as false positives in the koi catalog and koi-1032 exhibiting signatures of the ccd cross talk because the above assumption is less sound for them .",
    "we also examined the target pixel files of the remaining targets visually and excluded the ste of koi-3145 , whose depths are different in neighboring pixels and thus likely to be due to contamination from a nearby star ( see also * ? ?",
    "these criteria leave us with 16 stes in 14 systems , which are listed in table [ tab : list_fit ] along with their estimated parameters .",
    "while we use the markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to determine the system parameters , here we analytically show how the orbital period of the ste candidate is derived with the information on the mean stellar density either from the light curves of inner transiting planets with known orbital periods or from the follow - up observations of the host star .    assuming a circular orbit , the total and full transit durations ( denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respecitvely ) are given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 indicates the ratio of the planetary radius to the stellar radius , @xmath12 is the orbital inclination , and @xmath13 is the impact parameter . neglecting the terms of @xmath14 and higher , we obtain @xmath15 combined wtih kepler s third law , equation ( [ eq : ra ] ) yields the orbital period of an ste candidate in terms of its transit shape and the mean stellar density @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the stellar mass and radius .",
    "we also defined @xmath20 and @xmath21 and assumed @xmath22 .",
    "if the inner transiting planet(s ) is known in the system , equation ( [ eq : pk ] ) can be used to constrain @xmath16 from its transit shape because @xmath23 is already determined for the planet(s ) . in this case , the orbital period of the ste candidate @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where the subscripts @xmath26 and @xmath12 denote the quantities for the ste candidate and inner planet , respectively .",
    "this is the case for the 10 systems except for koi-1421 , 1208 , 1174 , and 1096 in table [ tab : list_fit ] .",
    "we checked that the analytic estimate in equation ( [ eq : ps_analytic ] ) is indeed consistent with the mcmc results for these systems .",
    "even if inner transiting planets are not known , the prior knowledge on @xmath16 from the color photometry can also be used to constrain @xmath24 , although it may be less reliable than the dynamical value as obtained in the previous case ; this method is adopted for koi-1421 , 1208 , 1174 , and 1096 .      for the 10 systems except for koi-1421 , 1208 , 1174 , and 1096 , we fit the ste light curves simultaneously with the phase - folded transit light curves of the other planet candidates in the system",
    ". we basically analyzed the long - cadence pdcsap fluxes except for the inner transits of koi-671 and koi-435 , for which short - cadence fluxes were used .",
    "we used pytransit package @xcite to generate the transit light curve based on @xcite model for the quadratic limb - darkening law .",
    "the effect of binning was taken into account by supersampling for the long - cadence data sampled at 30 minutes .",
    "constraints on the parameters were obtained by the mcmc sampling using emcee package @xcite following the standard @xmath27 minimization using the levenberg - marquardt method ( mpfit by * ? ? ?",
    "the likelihood for the mcmc sampling @xmath28 was computed as @xmath29 , where @xmath27 is a sum of the standard chi - squared for each planet s transit , and we adopt non - informative priors unless otherwise noted .",
    "transits of the inner planets were processed as follows .",
    "we first detrended the light curves from each quarter using the second - order spline interpolation , after masking the known transits based on the ephemeris and duration in the koi catalog .",
    "baseline fluxes during the transit were determined by the linear interpolation between the two ends of the masked region .",
    "the detrended transits were folded at the orbital period given in the koi catalog and averaged into one - minute bins .",
    "the value and error of the binned flux are given by the mean and its standard deviation of the values in each bin .",
    "the smoothing parameter of the spline was chosen so that the depth of the phase - folded transit be consistent with the catalog value .",
    "the ste light curves were deterened in a similar manner except that the smoothing parameter was chosen to be @xmath30 and that the endpoints of the linear interpolation were adjusted so that the resulting detrend light curve be not too asymmetric .",
    "the fitting parameters in this case are the sum of two coefficients for the quadratic limb - darkening law @xmath31 and @xmath32 as the parameters common to all the planets in the same system ; time of transit center @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and normalization of the flux @xmath36 for each of the inner transiting planets ; and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and orbital period @xmath24 for ste candidates .",
    "the difference of the limb - darkening coefficients @xmath37 were fixed to be the linearly interpolated values based on , and the orbital periods of the inner planets were fixed at the values given in the koi catalog . in mcmc fitting , we adopt the prior distributions uniform in @xmath31 , @xmath38 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath39 , @xmath36 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we assumed circular orbits for both inner candidates and ste candidates .    for koi-1421 , 1208 , 1174 , and 1096 ,",
    "we fit the ste light curve alone , imposing the gaussian prior on @xmath32 based on the value at cfop .",
    "the fitting parameters in this case are the two stellar parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath24 of the ste candidate .     in the analyses above",
    ", we neglect the effect of possible stellar multiplicity .",
    "if the target star has an unidentified companion star , for instance , the planetary radii can be underestimated due to the dilution .",
    "we note , however , that this possibility is essentially ruled out for most of our main candidates discussed in section 3.1 .",
    "the best - fit models and constraints on the parameters of ste candidates are summarized in figure [ fig : fit_all ] and table [ tab : list_fit ] .",
    "all the transits of the inner candidates simultaneously fitted with stes are listed in appendix . on the basis of the inferred orbital period and radius of ste candidates",
    ", we found that stes in seven systems are consistent with the planetary transit , as will be detailed in  [ sec : individual ] .",
    "architectures of these seven systems are illustrated in figure [ fig : sum ] .",

    "the size of the circles are proportional to the estimated planet radius .",

    "note that the orbital period determined from the interval of the two stes is adopted for koi-847 .",
    "our solar system is shown at the top for reference .",
    "the orbital period of the ste candidate in koi-1421 ( marked with an asterisk ) is based on the stellar density provided by cfop and may be less reliable than the others . ]",
    "on the basis of the fitting results , we classify the ste candidates in table [ tab : list_fit ] into three categories :    1 .",
    "candidates consistent with transiting lpgs , 2 .",
    "candidates exhibiting anomalous orbital periods , which we call  misfit \" singles , and 3 .   candidates likely to be eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) .    in the following ,",
    "we describe the details of the classification and comment on the properties of individual systems .",
    "seven systems illustrated in figure [ fig : sum ] exhibit stes consistent with the planetary transit .",
    "namely , ( 1 ) their transit light curves are consistently explained with those of the inner transiting planets or stellar density @xmath32 in the kic catalog , ( 2 ) their inferred radii are less than about the jupiter radius , and ( 3 ) their inferred orbital periods are consistent with the absence of other transits in the exiting _ kepler _ data ( i.e. inferred @xmath24 is longer than @xmath42 in table [ tab : list ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the candidates in this category except for koi-1421 are in multi - planetary systems and thus likely to be genuine planets in the same systems @xcite .      a neptune - sized planet candidate with the period of 80.9 days ( koi-847.01 )",
    "is already known in this system .",
    "we found additional two transit at @xmath43 and @xmath44 . if these two transits originate from the same object , its orbital period @xmath24 is @xmath45 .",
    "we individually fit each of the two events with the inner transit light curves and found the periods consistent with the above interval , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the other transit parameters were also consistent with each other .",
    "the two stes are therefore likely to be attributed to the same neptune - sized planet with @xmath48 .",
    "koi-671 is known as a compact multi - transiting system hosting four transiting planet candidates inside the orbit of mercury ( koi-671.0104 ) .",
    "we found an ste at @xmath49 consistent with a neptune - sized planet of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this @xmath24 is the longest among our ste candidates we found and is between those of jupiter and saturn .",
    "this system has one super - earth candidate ( koi-2525.01 ) .",
    "we found an ste at @xmath52 , for which we found @xmath53 and @xmath54 from the mcmc analysis .",
    "koi-1108 has a compact multi - transiting system with three super - earth candidates within @xmath55 ( koi-1108.0103 ) .",
    "we found an ste by a neptune - sized object ( @xmath56 ) with @xmath57 .",
    "this system harbors two confirmed super earths kepler-214b and c. we found one ste corresponding to a neptune - sized object with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the system hosts two confirmed super - earths / sub - neptunes ( kepler-154a and b ) and three planet candidates of similar radii .",
    "we found an ste due to a saturn - sized object at @xmath60 , which is listed as koi-435.02 in the koi catalog .",
    "our estimated radius and period are consistent with those in the catalog .",
    "the orbital period is best constrained for this ste candidate ( except for koi-847 exhibiting two stes ) due to the presence of multiple inner transiting planets and high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the ste we found is also listed in the koi catalog as koi-1421.01 .",
    "since this is the only transit signal known for the system , we fit the single ste light curve with a gaussian prior on the mean stellar density @xmath61 , which is based on the cfop value . as a result",
    ", we obtained @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the orbital period is consistent with the value given in the koi catalog .",
    "as mentioned at the beginning of this subsection , this candidate has a higher false positive probability than the others because this system has no inner companion .",
    "however , we ruled out the companion identified at @xmath64 away as a source of the fading event from inspection of the target pixel file .      for the stes in these systems , the orbital periods inferred from our fitting are shorter than @xmath42 in table [ tab : list ] , which is the minimum orbital period required for the ste candidate to be consistent with the absence of other transit signals in the existing _ kepler _ data .",
    "while the discrepancy may imply that they are false positives , it is also possible that the orbits of these ste candidates are eccentric , as shown below . for this reason",
    ", we still consider these  misfit \" singles as planet candidates , though less promising than those listed in the previous subsection .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where only the ste candidates have non - zero eccentricities , while the inner transiting objects are all on circular orbits . for eccentric orbits , the right - hand sides of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in equations ( [ eq : totald ] ) and ( [ eq : totalf ] )",
    "are multiplied by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the eccentricity and @xmath67 is the argument of periastron ( measured from the sky plane ) of the ste candidate ( e.g. equation ( 16 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the orbital period of the ste candidate with non - zero eccentricity differs from the circular case by the factor of @xmath68 assuming the same @xmath32 .",
    "as well , we neglect such rather small effects for the rough estimate here . ]",
    "since @xmath69 is larger than the ratio of @xmath42 to @xmath24 obtained from the circular fit ( table [ tab : list_fit ] ) , i.e. , @xmath70 , equation ( [ eq : p_ratio ] ) yields the minimum value of eccentricity required to explain the observation : @xmath71 the values of @xmath72 and @xmath42 for each of the  misfit \" candidates are listed in table [ tab : list_misfit ] , along with their values computed for the most conservative case ( see the note in the table ) .",
    "if ( some of ) these candidates are confirmed to be eccentric lpgs by follow - up observations , they can be interesting targets to understand the origin of hot jupiters , as in the case of hd 80606 @xcite .",
    "in this regard , the most promising target is koi-1208 with the _ kepler _ magnitude of 13.6 ( table [ tab : list ] ) , for which a possible nearby companion has been detected and the eccentricity is estimated to be @xmath73 .",
    "the inferred radius of this ste candidate suggests that it is a stellar object rather than a planet .",
    "the good agreement between the parameters of the two stes strongly implies that they are due to the same object .",
    "if this is indeed the case , this objects has @xmath74 . this system is also discussed in @xcite , who also classified it as a likely false positive .",
    "in figure [ fig : sum ] , the systems with multiple inner planets ( koi-671 , 1108 , 693 , and 435 ) exhibit a gap - like signature between the inner and ste candidates , as seen between the terrestrial and giant planets in the solar system ( top row ) .",
    "while we can not completely exclude the existence of such a gap in our sample , we suspect that it is due to the decrease in the transit probability with increasing orbital periods . because of the low transit probability of a distant planet , transiting objects on wide orbits ( say @xmath75 ) tend to be rare .",
    "this means that the system with one long - period transiting object detected , as in our sample , is unlikely to have another transiting object close to the detected one and exhibits a gap around the detected transiting object .    to demonstrate the above geometric effect",
    ", we performed a simple simulation of the transit detection of the multi - planetary system .",
    "we put 12 planets at a constant log - interval as in the first row of figure [ fig : sim ] .",
    "the semi - major axis over the host star radius , @xmath76 , of the outermost planet was chosen to be @xmath77 , which corresponds to @xmath78 or @xmath79 in the solar system .",
    "we simulated the transit observation of this system from many different directions uniformly distributed in @xmath34 , sampling the mutual inclinations of the inner planets with respect to the outermost one from the rayleigh distribution with @xmath80 @xcite in each run . from the resulting sample of transiting systems",
    ", we chose the systems where the transit of the outermost planet was detected and plotted their apparent architecture below the horizontal dashed line in figure [ fig : sim ] .",
    "one can actually see the gap - like structure between the outermost planets ( red circles ) and the inner planets ( blue circles ) in many cases .        as summarized in table [",
    "tab : occurrence_lpgs ] , the sample of 7557 kois we surveyed includes 695 systems with more than one inner transiting planet candidates , among which we detected four lpg candidates ( see also figure [ fig : sum ] ) . these numbers can be used to estimate the occurrence rate of lpgs in compact multi - transiting systems on the premise that lpg orbits are likely to be well aligned with those of the inner multiple planets .",
    "the premise is based on the following argument .",
    "the planets in a compact multi - transiting system presumably have well - aligned orbits @xcite , indicating that their orbital planes trace the original protoplanetary disk . since an lpg in the same system formed in the same disk , its orbit is likely to be aligned with the inner ones as well .",
    "the expected number of transiting lpgs , @xmath81 , in @xmath82 compact multi - transiting systems is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the average number of lpgs per system and @xmath85 is the transit probability of a given lpg , both under the existence of the inner compact multi - transiting system .",
    "the factor @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the observing duration of _ kepler _ and @xmath88 is the orbital period of a given lpg , takes into account the probability that the single transit of the lpg falls into the mission life time of _",
    "kepler_. since @xmath85 depends on the mutual inclination of the lpg and the inner planets , the mutual inclination and occurrence rate @xmath89 are usually degenerate @xcite .",
    "as far as the mutual inclination between the lpg and inner - planet orbits is as small as @xmath90 , we approximately have @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the typical semi - major axes of the lpg and inner multi - transiting planets , respectively ( see  2.3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . adopting @xmath94 ( corresponding to @xmath95 ) and @xmath96 ( median of koi candidates in multi - transiting systems ) , we obtain @xmath97 , which yields @xmath98 for @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 ( average of the seven systems in figure [ fig : sum ] ) in equation ( [ eq : occurrence ] ) .",
    "if the lpg has actually larger mutual inclination relative to the inner planets than assumed here ( @xmath103 ) , the above estimate underpredicts the true occurrence rate . for @xmath94 and @xmath104 , which results in @xmath105 . ]",
    "in addition , the above discussion assumes that the transiting lpg is @xmath106 detected as long as it transits the host star during the _ kepler _ observation .",
    "for these reasons , we conclude that @xmath98 estimated above is a rough lower limit , and that about @xmath107 or more of the compact multi - transiting systems host lpgs with @xmath75 .",

    "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    table [ tab : occurrence_lpgs ] also shows that the fraction of transiting lpgs in kois with only one inner transiting candidate is smaller than the above multiple - candidate case by an order of magnitude . while we suffer from the small statistics",
