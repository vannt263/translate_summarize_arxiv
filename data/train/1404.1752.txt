    "in recent years , majorana fermions have attracted immense attention due to their possible applications in quantum computation.@xcite they are proposed to exist in various systems@xcite and many experimental attempts have been devoted to identify them.@xcite among these attempts , the zero - bias conductance peak@xcite is a characteristic property from the majorana modes which is often detected .",
    "this conductance measurement is easy to perform and the zero - bias conductance peak has already been observed.@xcite nevertheless , these experimental results can not serve as decisive evidence since the zero - bias conductance peak can appear due to many other mechanisms.@xcite hence , to further identify the majorana fermions , the comprehension and detection of more transport properties at different majorana configurations are needed .    among the works investigating majorana nanostructures , the system of two connected nanostructures with different order parameter phases is often investigated .",
    "it is found in various materials@xcite that when this phase difference is @xmath0 , two majorana modes can appear around the contacting point .",

    "we find that when the difference of phases in the wires is @xmath0 , two majorana modes indeed appear around the ring .",
    "however , when the phase difference is zero , the states around the ring have finite energies . when the ring radius is small , the properties of the differential conductance from leads 1 to 3 in these two cases are different . for the case with the majorana modes ,",
    "the interference of the andreev reflections through these two majorana modes leads to two differential conductance peaks very close to the zero bias in the bias dependence . for the case without the majorana modes , the localized states around the ring lead to resonant peaks far away from the zero bias .",
    "the different behaviors in the two cases under small ring radius are easy to be distinguished from each other . moreover , since the phase difference changes discontinuously from zero to @xmath0 , the differential conductance peaks also change _ discontinuously _ from the case without the majorana modes to those with them .",
    "this is a unique property which can be used to identify the existence of the majorana modes from the other mechanisms leading to the zero - bias peak .",
    "nevertheless , this detection is necessary to be carried out under small ring radius .",
    "this is because that the energies of the states around the ring under zero phase difference can be close to zero at a large ring radius , which makes the peaks difficult to distinguish from each other .",

    "these behaviors indicate the existence of the majorana modes around the ring .",
    "these majorana modes interact with those at the ends of the nanostructure ( @xmath95 and @xmath93 ) which leads to the small nonzero eigenvalues ( i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "since the interaction between them decreases exponentially with the increase of their distance , we also calculate the case with @xmath100 , which leads to much lower @xmath91 ( @xmath101 ) and @xmath97 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this behavior confirms the existence of the majorana fermions around the ring .",

    "thus , the differential conductance through each lead is mainly determined by the states around the lead which helps to show their influence clearer .",
    "it is noted that the property of the differential conductance between leads 1 and 2 , i.e. , @xmath106 , is mainly determined by the majorana modes at the ends of the nanostructure ( @xmath95 and @xmath93 shown in fig .",
    "[ figsw1 ] ) , which is similar to previous works in the literature.@xcite hence , it is not shown in the figure . in this work we only concentrate on the differential conductance between leads 1 and 3 , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "we first focus on the case with a short ring radius ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) . for the case with @xmath98 where the phase difference of the order parameters in the two wires is @xmath0 ( i.e. , with the majorana modes around the ring ) , two conductance peaks appear in the bias voltage @xmath108 dependence which are very close to the zero bias ( i.e. , @xmath109 ) and hence lead to a sharp valley between them as shown in fig .  [",
    "figsw3](a ) . with the increase of @xmath1 to @xmath110 , where the phase difference is still @xmath0 ,",
    "the valley is shown to become milder . nevertheless , the corresponding peaks are still close to the zero bias .",
    "on contrast , for the case with zero phase difference ( i.e. , without any majorana modes around the ring ) , e.g. , @xmath85 and @xmath111 , the peaks appearing in the bias dependence become close to the energies of the second lowest states ( marked as arrows ) which are far away from zero .",
    "this behavior is quite different from that with the majorana modes and hence can be used to distinguish the two cases .",
    "moreover , since the phase difference varies discontinuously from zero to @xmath0 , the conductance peaks without the majorana modes also change to the ones with them _",
    "discontinuously_. this is a unique property of the majorana modes which helps to exclude the other mechanisms leading to the zero - bias peaks .    here , we give an analytical investigation on the properties of the differential conductance peaks in the cases with and without the majorana modes around the ring .",
    "the differential conductance @xmath107 is determined by the andreev reflections through leads 1 and 3 under the constraint of current conservation ( which determines @xmath112 and @xmath113 incorporating with @xmath69 ) . for the andreev reflection through lead 1 ,",
    "it is strong due to the majorana mode near lead 1 ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) and the corresponding @xmath114 is almost 1 in our parameter range . on the contrary ,",
    "the andreev reflection through lead 3 varies largely and the corresponding @xmath115 is found to be zero around the zero bias .",

    "( [ g13 ] ) ] . with this understanding ,",
    "the conductance peaks close to the zero bias in the case with @xmath0 phase difference are understood to come from the andreev reflection through the majorana modes around the ring . and",
    "the peaks close to the energies of the second lowest states in the case with zero phase difference are understood to come from the resonance andreev reflection through these subgap states [ which are also localized around the ring , see fig .",
    "[ figsw2 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "it is noted that both the contributions of the majorana modes ( with @xmath0 phase difference ) and the second lowest states ( with zero phase difference ) can be studied formally by investigating the andreev reflection through states @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 due to the partial - hole symmetry . here , by setting @xmath120 being the fermion mode composed by the majorana modes @xmath123 and @xmath124 around the ring [ i.e. , @xmath125 and setting the corresponding energies @xmath126 , the result describes the tunneling through the two majorana modes .",
    "meanwhile , by setting @xmath120 being the second lowest state ( i.e. , @xmath127 ) and using @xmath128 , it describes the tunneling through the second lowest states .",
    "since the lead 3 is connected to the nanostructure at one point , the couplings between these two states @xmath120 and @xmath121 to the lead 3 are determined by their wave functions at the connecting point which are described by @xmath129 and @xmath130 in the nambu spinors .",

    "the variation of the ring radius changes the couplings between the states in different wires . as a result",

    "[ figsw3](c ) and ( d ) . since the properties of the energy spectra for these two magnetic field directions are similar ( see fig .",

    "figsw3](c ) ] and large [ @xmath104 shown in fig .  [ figsw3](d ) ] ring radii .",
    "nevertheless , if the magnetic flux is not applied ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) , it is shown in figs .  [ figsw3](c ) and ( d ) that the corresponding differential conductances keep zero in our parameter range .",
    "this special property comes from the mirror inversion symmetry of the nanostructure which is understood as follows .    with the magnetic field along the @xmath10-axis applied to the nanostructure ,",

    "then , the andreev reflection is understood to be proportional to @xmath148 ( see also appendix ) . for our nanostructure without the magnetic flux , the hamiltonian is invariant under the mirror inversion with the inversion axis along the lead 3 ( the corresponding operator is @xmath149 , with @xmath150 ) .",

    "we further investigate the transport property of the nanostructure by connecting two normal leads to the wires and a third one directly to the ring .",
    "the low bias differential conductance between one of the leads connected at the wire and the one at the ring is mainly limited by the small andreev reflection through the lead connected at the ring , due to the current conversation .",
    "hence , in both cases , i.e. , with and without the majorana modes around the ring , this differential conductance can show very distinct features . in the case with the majorana modes ( i.e. , with @xmath0 phase difference ) , the bias dependence of the differential conductance exhibits two peaks very close to the zero bias due to the interference of the andreev reflections through these two majorana modes .",
    "on contrast , in the case without the majorana modes ( i.e. , with zero phase difference ) , it shows peaks far away from the zero bias if the ring radius is small .",
    "this is due to the resonant andreev reflections through the localized states with finite energies .",
    "the behaviors in these two cases under small ring radius can be easily distinguished from each other .",
    "this is a unique property of the majorana modes which helps to exclude the other mechanisms leading to the zero - bias peak .",
    "nevertheless , we also point out that if the ring radius becomes large , the energies of the states in the case with the zero phase difference can be very close to zero , which makes the corresponding peaks difficult to be distinguished from those due to the majorana modes in the case with @xmath0 phase difference .",
    "hence , to identify the majorana modes , small ring radius is a must .",
    "in addition , we also find that due to the mirror symmetry of the nanostructure , the andreev reflection through the lead connected at the ring ( which is along the inversion axis ) is forbidden around the zero bias if the magnetic field is parallel to the wires and the magnetic flux is absent .",

    "<S> moreover , a magnetic flux is applied through the center of the ring , which makes the phase difference of the superconducting order parameters in the two wires being zero or @xmath0 due to the fluxoid quantization and the thermodynamic equilibrium of the supercurrent in the superconducting ring . </S>",
    "<S> if the phase difference is @xmath0 , two majorana modes are shown to appear around the ring without interacting with each other . </S>",
    "<S> on contrast , if the phase difference is zero , these majorana modes disappear and the states localized around the ring have finite energies . </S>",
    "<S> these states can be detected via the conductance measurement by connecting two normal leads to the wires and a third one directly to the ring . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown in the bias dependence of the differential conductance from one of the leads connected to the wire to the one connected directly to the ring that the tunnelings through the majorana modes ( i.e. , in the case with @xmath0 phase difference ) leads to two peaks very close to the zero bias , while the tunneling through the states with finite energies ( i.e. , in the case with zero phase difference ) leads to peaks far away from the zero bias if the ring radius is small . </S>",
    "<S> this difference for the cases with and without the majorana modes in small ring radius is distinct and hence can be used to identify the majorana modes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also find that , because of the mirror inversion symmetry of the nanostructure , the andreev reflection through the lead connected at the ring ( which is along the inversion axis ) is forbidden around the zero bias if the magnetic flux is zero and the magnetic field is parallel to the wires . </S>"
