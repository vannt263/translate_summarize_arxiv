    "measurements of the deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons and nucleons , @xmath0 , allow the extraction of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) which describe the longitudinal momentum carried by the quarks , anti - quarks and gluons that make up the fast - moving nucleons .",
    "these functions have been measured over a wide kinematic range in the bjorken scaling variable @xmath1 and the photon virtuality @xmath2 .",
    "while pdfs provide crucial input to perturbative quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) calculations of processes involving hadrons , they do not provide a complete picture of the partonic structure of nucleons .",
    "in particular , pdfs contain neither information on the correlations between partons nor on their transverse motion , then a vital knowledge about the three dimensional structure of the nucleon is lost .",
    "hard exclusive processes , in which the nucleon remains intact , have emerged in recent years as prime candidates to complement this essentially one dimentional picture @xcite .",
    "the simplest exclusive process is the deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) or exclusive production of real photon , @xmath3 .",
    "this process is of particular interest as it has both a clear experimental signature and is calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "the dvcs reaction can be regarded as the elastic scattering of the virtual photon off the proton via a colourless exchange , producing a real photon in the final state @xcite . in the bjorken scaling regime , qcd calculations assume that the exchange involves two partons , having different longitudinal and transverse momenta , in a colourless configuration . these unequal momenta or skewing",
    "are a consequence of the mass difference between the incoming virtual photon and the outgoing real photon .",
    "this skewedness effect can be interpreted in the context of generalised parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite .",
    "these functions carry information on both the longitudinal and the transverse distribution of partons .",
    "the dvcs cross section depends , therefore , on gpds @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we examine the most recent data recorded from the desy @xmath4 collider at hera and their implication on the quarks / gluons imaging of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the first measurements of dvcs cross section have been realised at hera within the h1 and zeus experiments @xcite .",
    "these results are given in the specific kinematic domain of both experiments , at low @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) but they take advantage of the large range in @xmath2 , offered by the hera kinematics , which covers more than 2 orders of magnitude , from @xmath6 to @xmath7 gev@xmath8 .",
    "it makes possible to study the transition from the low @xmath2 non - perturbative region ( around @xmath6 gev@xmath8 ) towards higher values of @xmath2 where the higher twists effects are lowered ( above @xmath9 gev@xmath8 ) .",
    "the last dvcs cross sections as a functon of @xmath10 are presented on figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "a major experimental achievement of h1 @xcite has been the measurement of dvcs cross sections , differential in @xmath11 , the momentum transfer ( squared ) at the proton vertex .",
    "some results are presente on figure [ fig1b ] : we observe the good description of @xmath12 by a fit of the form @xmath13 .",
    "hence , an extraction of the @xmath14-slope parameter @xmath15 is accessible for different values of @xmath2 and @xmath16 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .    .",

    "measurements of the @xmath14-slope parameters @xmath15 are key measurements for almost all exclusive processes , in particular dvcs .",
    "indeed , a fourier transform from momentum to impact parameter space readily shows that the @xmath14-slope @xmath15 is related to the typical transverse distance between the colliding objects @xcite . at high scale , the @xmath19 dipole is almost point - like , and the @xmath14 dependence of the cross section is given by the transverse extension of the gluons ( or sea quarks ) in the proton for a given @xmath1 range .",
    "more precisely , from the generalised parton distribution @xmath20 defined in the introduction , we can compute a parton density which also depends on a spatial degree of freedom , the transverse size ( or impact parameter ) , labeled @xmath21 , in the proton .",
    "both functions are related by a fourier transform @xmath22 thus , the transverse extension @xmath23 of gluons ( or sea quarks ) in the proton can be written as @xmath24_{t = 0 } = 2 b\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the exponential @xmath14-slope .",
    "measurements of @xmath15 presented in figure [ fig2 ] corresponds to @xmath25  fm at large scale @xmath2 for @xmath26 . this value is smaller that the size of a single proton , and , in contrast to hadron - hadron scattering",
    ", it does not expand as energy @xmath16 increases .",
    "this result is consistent with perturbative qcd calculations in terms of a radiation cloud of gluons and quarks emitted around the incoming virtual photon .",
    "the complete parton imaging in the nucleon would need to get measurements of @xmath15 for several values of @xmath1 , from the low @xmath5 till @xmath27 .",
    "experimentally , it appears to be impossible .",
    "is it the breakout of quark and gluon imaging in the proton ?",
    "in fact , there is one way to recover @xmath1 and @xmath14 correlations over the whole @xmath1 domain : we need to measure a beam charge asymmetry ( bca ) @xcite .",
    "the determination of a cross section asymmetry with respect to the beam charge is realised by measuring the ratio @xmath28 as a function of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the lattest experimental result from h1 is presented in figure [ fig3 ] with a fit in @xmath30 . after applying a deconvolution method to account for the resolution on @xmath29 ,",
    "the coefficient of the @xmath30 dependence is found to be @xmath31 .",
    "the relative large positve value ( more than two standard deviations from zero ) is favoring a non - factorised approach between @xmath1 and @xmath14 variables , which means that on a wide range of @xmath1 , the @xmath14-slope @xmath15 is certainly dependent on @xmath1 .",
    "this result represents obviously a major progress in the understanding of the very recent field of the parton imaging in the proton .",
