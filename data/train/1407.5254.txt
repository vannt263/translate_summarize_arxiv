    "in the middle of sixties , the algorithmic complexity theory was independently developed by kolmogorov @xcite and chaitin @xcite .",
    "to parameterize complexity in deterministic or random dynamical systems , the most important quantity which may be used is entropy .",
    "there are different ways to count the diversity of any pattern generated by a data source : shannon entropy , metric entropy , topological entropy , etc .",
    "after the seminal works of shannon @xcite , in 1949 the word entropy came to the fore in the new context of information theory , coding theory , and cryptography . recently the concept of entropy is also used in econophysics ( see @xcite and references therein ) and sociodynamics @xcite .",
    "the concept of entropy has been evolved along different ways : renyi entropy @xcite , topological entropy @xcite , tsallis entropy @xcite , directional entropy @xcite , permutation entropy @xcite , epsilon - tau entropy @xcite , etc .",
    "permutation entropy was introduced by bandt , keller , and pompe in @xcite .",
    "entropies are basic observables for dynamical systems . in @xcite",
    "a piecewise monotone map @xmath6 from an interval @xmath7 into itself is defined , and it is shown that for piecewise monotone interval maps the kolmogorov - sinai entropy can be obtained from order statistics of the values in a generic orbit . it has been shown that it is possible to use the permutation entropy to detect dynamical changes in a complex time series @xcite .",
    "recently , permutation entropy has been used to study dynamical changes of eeg data @xcite ; and based on permutation entropy , mutual information of two oscillators has been calculated @xcite .    in this article variety of micro patterns in financial time series have been studied .",
    "variety of patterns in financial time series is an important measure . in a completely random series",
    "all different patterns may occur with equal weight .",
    "if some patterns in a time series are much less than the others , the time series contains dominant patterns .",
    "these dominant patterns represent some characteristics of the system , which needs to be revealed .",
    "this information also could be used for prediction of future changes , which for financial time series represent inefficiency in the target market .",
    "there are several definition for the efficient market hypothesis ( emh ) @xcite . according to the emh hypothesis , asset prices move as random walks over time , and",
    "technical analysis should provide no useful information to predict future changes @xcite .",
    "this means that asset prices in an efficient market fluctuate randomly in response to the unanticipated component of news @xcite .",
    "some people take emh as a core assumption in finance theory @xcite .",
    "but many physicists consider it only an approximation @xcite .",
    "according to emh , in an efficient market variety of patterns for increments of the price in different scales should be at maximum level .",
    "it is now known that most markets behave efficiently in macro scale , and there are no dominate patterns in their financial time series .",
    "but it seems that the investigation of micro patterns , and searching for dominant patterns by participants in markets , in recent years , have faded those patterns .",
    "permutation entropy is taken as a criteria for measuring the variety of micro patterns which may be seen in financial time series .",
    "tick to tick exchange rate time series are considered as an example .",
    "consider a set of @xmath8 distinct real numbers , @xmath9 .",
    "one may define a map from these numbers to the set @xmath10 in such a way that the ordering of the second set is the same as the first one .",
    "the range of this map will be @xmath11 permutations .",
    "the permutation corresponding to @xmath12 is called the _ pattern _ , and is denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "1 , for the case @xmath14 . consider a time series @xmath15 . by a window of length @xmath8 ,",
    "we mean any subsequence of the form @xmath16 .",
    "there are @xmath17 windows of length @xmath8 , to each of them there corresponds a pattern @xmath13 . if @xmath18 is a given pattern , we define @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of @xmath8 consecutive numbers with pattern @xmath18 . for large @xmath21",
    ", @xmath22 tends to the probability of occurring the pattern @xmath18 .",
    "permutation entropy of order @xmath8 of a time series , @xmath23 , is defined as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath24 it can be shown that @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "upper bound occurs when all @xmath22 s have the same value , _",
    "i.e. _ when the time series is a completely random series ; and the lower bound occurs when only one of @xmath22 s is nonzero , which happens when the time series is a decreasing or increasing sequence .    ]",
    "permutations @xmath26 , for @xmath14    in some cases a linear function @xmath27 is a good approximation .",
    "this means that for these time series , in the view of permutation entropy , there are just two degrees of freedom for the time series , for large @xmath8 , which is not a linear function of @xmath8 . ] .    for large @xmath8",
    ", @xmath28 determines the behavior of @xmath29 . to quantize the variety of patterns in this type of time series",
    "one may use the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "it is useful to define a new parameter , @xmath30 which is the permutations entropy of order @xmath8 of a time series per symbol : @xmath31 the denominator is @xmath32 , because calculating a change means @xmath33 . for large @xmath8",
    ", @xmath30 converges to @xmath28 . therefore to calculate @xmath28 one can find the slope of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "if the information embodied in a time series can not be compressed , the time series is called unpredictable .",
    "as it is stated in @xcite , no difference can be detected between a time series carrying a large amount of non - redundant economic information and a pure random process , and it is well - known that the financial time series carries a large amount of non - redundant information .",
    "therefore , the complexity of time series can be measured by assigning a measure to the variety of patterns which are embedded in time series .",
    "we have analyzed the exchange rates as a time series .",
    "the data we have used , are tick to tick exchange rates of usd / jpy , eur / gbp and gbp / chf for 2003 which are time series of about 5000,000 data points , denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "let us calculate @xmath29 for @xmath35 . as it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , @xmath29 is a linear function of @xmath32 .",
    "so it is more useful to work with @xmath30 . to calculate @xmath28 we need @xmath30 for large @xmath8 .",
    "the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is less than 5% . from now on by large @xmath8 , we mean @xmath38 , and we take @xmath37 as an approximation of @xmath28 .    ]",
    "the plot of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 as a function of @xmath32 . in some cases , such as a completely random time series , @xmath41 for large @xmath8 does not behave as a linear function of @xmath8 , for example in this special case",

    "@xmath47 is calculated for windows of length 10000 . to obtain the time dependence of parameter , in each time step the window",

    "the dynamics of the parameter @xmath28 may represent the dynamics of complexity of the financial time series over time .",
    "it could also be used as a measure of complexity of financial time series .",
    "one may take a completely random series as a reference series , and compare the complexity of a financial time series with that of a completely random one .",
    "since @xmath28 is not a proper parameter for a completely random series , we should take @xmath29 instead of @xmath28 . to compare the complexity of a time series with the complexity of completely random series",

    "the result for the exchange rate time series is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that tick to tick exchange rates time series show much less variety of micro patterns when compared with completely random series .",
    "this means that some patterns occur more than other patterns in these time series .",
    "so in micro scale some patterns can be seen more than the others .",
    "recently technology development leads to quick news release , improving the quality of data analysis , better information sharing , and increasing the number of participants in financial markets . in 2009",
    "high frequency trading accounts for over 60% of the financial exchanges trading volume @xcite .",
    "high frequency trading strategies are characterized by a higher number of trades and a lower average gain per trade .",
    "currently , there are categories of high - frequency trading strategies .",
    "some of them are based on the investigation of micro patterns .",
    "typically the holding period of these strategies are less than 1 minute .",
    "the micro patterns observed in the financial time series have been affected by these technology developments .",
    "we believe that the recent investigations of the micro patterns , and searching for the dominant patterns by participants in the markets , have faded those patterns .",
    "we now present our reasoning .    in an efficient market , the future price",
    "is determined entirely by the information which is not contained in the price series .",
    "this means that price changes are random , and the variety of patterns are at the maximum level .",
    "financial time series may behave differently on different time scales @xcite .",
    "we investigate the variety of patterns in a financial time series on different time scales .",
    "if we enlarge the sampling interval time from tick to tick to higher intervals , the sampling rate would decrease , and as a result high frequency contributions in the original time series will be removed . by high frequencies we mean",
    "those with time change less than the new sampling interval time .",
    "finally , we compute the contributions of high frequencies in the complexity , for @xmath38 , see fig .",
    "it is seen that removing high frequencies leads to increasing the complexity in the time period .",
    "this means that in larger scales , by the variety of patterns , these time series behave more similar to a complete random series , which is already known .",
    "but it is important to notice that in 2003 , for 16 ticks period , there is still a large difference between these time series and a completely random series .",
    "it should be stated that for the time series we have used , the bid ask bounce effect appears only on 1 tick scale",
    ". therefore , this market behaves inefficiently in both the micro and the macro scales ; however , in the micro scale the market is more inefficient .    to test the accuracy of the theory of fading dominant patterns , and to investigate how the variety of patterns evolve in time ,",
    "data for usd / jpy , eur / gbp and gbp / chf for 2003 , 2009 and 2012 have been also analyzed .",
    "normalized complexity of permutation patterns , @xmath37 , for first difference of exchange rates are computed and shown in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] ( -270,0)@xmath50(-270,10)@xmath43(-30,0)@xmath51(-30,10)@xmath43    normalized complexity of usd / jpy as a function of time for different sampling rate , e.g. for 16 ticks plot , the first data point is taken and the other 15 data points are discarded .",
    "the sizes of data used in the tables are different .",
    "consider the data with minimum size .",
    "using monte carlo method , we have seen that the parameter @xmath37 , for a sample realizations of random walk with that minimum size , in 99% of cases is more than 0.98 .",
    "so the number 0.98 could be taken as a critical value for rejection / acceptance ratio of the _ efficient market hypothesis_.    as it is seen from the figures , in 2012 the variety of patterns evolve through time , and for 4 ticks scale there are no dominant patterns _ i.e. _ , the scale over which the target markets have no dominant patterns , decreases steadily over time with the emergence of higher frequency trading .",
