    "gravitational microlensing is the technique of detecting exoplanets using gravitational lensing .",
    "microlensing is unique in its ability to detect planets @xcite just outside of the snow line @xcite down to an earth mass @xcite , which is difficult or impossible with other methods .",
    "according to the core accretion theory , the snow line @xcite plays a very crucial role in the planet formation process . beyond the snow line ,",
    "ices condense , increasing the density of the solid materials .",
    "higher density of solids speeds the planet formation process in the protoplanetary disk , hence forming cold planets quickly beyond the snow line .",
    "the planets , discovered by microlensing , provide the statistics needed to understand the architecture of cold planets beyond the snow line @xcite . since this method does not rely on the light from the host stars , it can detect planets , even when the host stars can not be detected @xcite .",
    "most of the planets discovered so far using microlensing are @xmath7-@xmath8kpc away .",
    "thus , microlensing is able to detect planets in the inner galactic disk and bulge , where it is difficult to detect planets with other methods .",
    "thus , microlensing has the potential to measure how the properties of exoplanets depend on the galactic environment .    for most planetary microlensing events , the angular einstein radius",
    ", @xmath9 is measured from the finite source effect . in events where the lens star brightness @xcite or the parallax effect is measured @xcite , the planetary mass and distance to the planetary system can be determined .",
    "hence this technique can be used to build statistics of planetary mass as a function of the host star mass . since the planets detected by microlensing are @xmath7-@xmath8kpc away",
    ", the distance to the planetary system will also allow the determination of the planetary mass function as a function of the distance towards the galactic center .",
    "in this paper we present the discovery of a gas giant planet orbiting the lens stars for microlensing event ogle-2014-blg-1760 .",
    "the mass ratio of this planet is @xmath10 , which is slightly less than that of jupiter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec - lc_data ] describes the light curve data collected for the event ogle-2014-blg-1760 .",
    "the next section ( section [ sec - lc ] ) is divided in four parts : [ sec - data - reduction ] summarizes data reduction procedures for the different data sets ; section [ sec - best - fit ] shows the best fit model and procedures that are used to obtain it ; section [ sec - limb - darkening ] describes how the limb darkening of the source is modeled ; and section [ sec - parallax ] presents our attempt to detect the microlensing parallax effect in the light curve . in section [ sec - radius ] , we discuss source brightness and angular radius measurement and derive the lens - source relative proper motion .",
    "section [ sec - lens ] discusses an estimate of the lens properties and the future possible investigations .",
    "the _ ogle _ ( optical gravitational lensing experiment ) collaboration operates a microlensing survey towards the galactic bulge , with the 1.3 meter warsaw telescope from las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "most of the ogle - iv ( phase 4 ) observations were taken in the cousins @xmath11-band , with occasional observations in johnson @xmath12-band @xcite . in the year 2014 , ogle early warning system ( ews ) @xcite has alerted 2049 microlensing candidates of which this event ogle-2014-blg-1760 was the 1760th one .",
    "the _ moa _ ( microlensing observation in astrophysics ) @xcite collaboration also operates a microlensing survey towards the galactic bulge with the 1.8 meter moa - ii telescope from mount john observatory at lake tekapo , new zealand .",
    "the observations are mostly taken in moa - red wide band filter which covers the wavelengths of the standard cousins @xmath13 bands . for year 2014 , moa has reported about @xmath1433 microlensing anomalies out of which ogle-2014-blg-1760 planetary event is one of them .    both of these telescopes have relatively large fields - of - view , 2.2 deg@xmath15 for moa - ii , and 1.4 deg@xmath15 for ogle - iv .",
    "these enable survey observations with cadences as high as one observation every 15 minutes , and this allows the surveys to detect the sharp light curve features of planetary light curve features , when they are only smoothed by the finite source effects of a main sequence source star .",
    "it is the high cadence observation of microlensing events of moa - ii and ogle - iv survey that helps in detecting microlensing anomalies , including the microlensing planetary signatures .",
    "the microlensing event ogle-2014-blg-1760 was discovered at ( ra , decl.)(2000 ) = ( @xmath16)[(l , b)=(@xmath17 ) ] , by the ogle ews on august 22 , 2014 around 7.25 a.m. edt .",
    "the same event was alerted by moa on august 31 , 2014 as moa-2014-blg-547 .",
    "later , on september 10 , 2014 , the moa collaboration detected the planetary cusp crossing and announced the anomaly in the light curve ( around hjd = 2456911 in figure 1 ) .",
    "in response to moa anomaly alert , the follow up groups robonet and @xmath18fun started collecting data on this event .",
    "the high cadence observation of moa - ii survey covered most of the cusp crossing , and the trough after the cusp crossing was well covered by follow up groups , robonet and @xmath18fun .",
    "the robonet group observed the event with 1 m robotic telescopes at cape town , south africa and at siding springs , australia , in the sloan @xmath11-band .",
    "the @xmath18fun group also observed the event with the 1.3 m smarts ctio telescopes in both the @xmath12 and @xmath11-bands .",
    "all these observations are shown in figure 1 .",
    "although the @xmath18fun data is pretty flat because the trough is followed by the normal single lens decrease ( see figure 1 ) , the @xmath18fun data do help to exclude the wide model with s = 1.27 and contribute in constraining the planetary model ( discussed in section [ sec - best - fit ] ) .",
    "it is true that the constraint from the robonet and ogle data is stronger because of better robonet coverage and ogle observations over a wider range of magnifications .",

    "all the images were reduced to photometry using the difference image method @xcite .",
    "the moa images were reduced using moa difference image analysis pipeline ( @xcite ) .",
    "the data was then detrended using the non-2014 data to minimize the error due to the effects of differential refraction , seeing and airmass . to avoid systematic errors due to flat field changes and changes in detector sensitivity",
    ", we removed data prior to 2011 and only use the data after hjd@xmath19 ( february , 2011 ) for modeling .",
    "ogle data were reduced using ogle difference image analysis software and optimal centroid method ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath18fun photometry was produced using a modified version of the pysis package @xcite .",
    "robonet data were reduced using the dandia package @xcite .",
    "the error bar estimates obtained from the photometry codes are sufficient to find the best fit model .",
    "these error bar estimates are good measures of the relative uncertainties for measurements with the same telescope , but they are often wrong by a factor of @xmath142 . to determine the uncertainties for the model parameters , it is necessary to have accurate error bars which will give @xmath20 for each passband .",
    "we used method of @xcite to normalize the error bars using @xmath21 . here",

    "there are three non - linear model parameters for a single lens event : @xmath31 - the time of peak magnification , @xmath32 - the minimum separation between source and lens in einstein radius units , and @xmath33 - the einstein radius crossing time .",
    "there are also two linear parameters for each passband : the source flux @xmath34 , and the blend flux , @xmath35 .",
    "we find the best single lens parameters as the starting point for a systematic search through parameter space to find the best binary lens solution .",
    "because the light curve follows a single lens shape for most of its history , except in the vicinity of the planetary feature at @xmath36 , we can use the best fit single lens parameters as the starting point for an initial condition grid search , following @xcite .    to describe a binary lens ,",
    "we need three additional parameters : the lens mass ratio , @xmath37 , the projected separation between the lens masses , @xmath38 , measured in einstein radius units , and the angle between the source trajectory and the lens axis , @xmath39 .",
    "also , binary events often have caustic or cusp crossings , which resolve the angular size of the source , so we need an additional parameter , the source radius crossing time , @xmath40 , to model finite source effects . with the single lens parameters fixed to the best fit values , we using the initial condition grid search method to search over the parameter ranges @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , with @xmath40 fixed at @xmath44 .",
    "we then select @xmath45 of the best fit values from the initial condition grid search ( with very different values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) to use as initial conditions for full , non - linear modeling runs using the @xcite @xmath46 minimization recipe , which is a modification of markov chain monte carlo algorithm @xcite .",

    "this is usually not the case for low magnification planetary events because the caustic structure for the major and minor image caustics is quite different .",
    "however , the major and minor image caustics with @xmath49 are encountered at the same single lens magnification , and with specific source trajectories , it is possible to produce similar light curves with both @xmath50 and @xmath51 , particularly if the light curves are nt very well sampled .",
    "therefore , we have searched for models with @xmath52 .",
    "we found a best fit @xmath50 model with @xmath53 , but this is a worse fit than the best fit model ( with @xmath54 ) by @xmath55 .",
    "this is because the ogle-2014-blg-1760 is well sampled , so the @xmath53 model is excluded , and the @xmath56 is the only viable solution .",

    "these corresponds to the temperature of @xmath60 k and a surface gravity of @xmath61 .",
    "the parameters of the best fit model are insensitive to the precise limit darkening parameters .",
    "the microlensing parallax effect has been detected in a number of planetary microlensing events @xcite where it has allowed the lens system masses to be measured . due to the earth s orbital motion about the sun",

    "when both the microlensing parallax effect and the angular einstein radius ( as described in section [ sec - radius ] ) are measured , we can determine the lens system mass and distance from the following equations : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 is the total mass of host star and planet and @xmath70 and @xmath71kpc are the distances to the lens system and source stars , respectively .",
    "the host star mass , @xmath72 , is given by @xmath73 .    in order to include the microlensing parallax effect , we must add two new model parameters @xmath65 and @xmath74 , the magnitude and direction angle of the parallax vector .",

    "the statistical analysis of @xcite shows that the planet detection efficiency weighted median @xmath33 value is @xmath145 days .",
    "this effect occurs for high magnification events @xcite because high magnification is much easier to predict when @xmath33 is large , and for low magnification events @xcite because the planetary signal duration ( for fixed @xmath37 ) is proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "this effect can be accounted for with accurate detection efficiency calculations , but @xcite use a detection efficiency calculation for an advance ground - based survey , that is much more sensitive than any ground - based survey undertaken to date .",
    "one of us @xcite has previously studied a variety of ground - based microlensing surveys with a wide range of telescope options , and these simulations show that this detection efficiency bias with @xmath33 is much stronger with the less capable surveys that can approximate the sensitivity of the observing programs that have discovered the published events .",
    "it should also be noted that the color of the source star @xmath0 implies that this star is bluer than and only marginally consistent with bulge main sequence shown in figure  [ fig - cmd ] . this source star could be a `` blue straggler '' which is an old , bright blue star that probably formed from a merger of two smaller stars , but these stars are rare , or it could be that this field has a larger fraction of bluer , metal poor stars than the hst baade s window stars plotted in figure  [ fig - cmd ] .",
    "but this also seems unlikely .",
    "another possibility is that this star is a relatively young blue star that resides in the galactic disk on the far side of the bulge with minimal additional extinction between the bulge and this source star .",
    "if so , hst observations taken separated by 2 years could reveal the characteristic source star proper motion of a far side disk star .",
    "since the galactic coordinates of the source , @xmath146 are pretty close to the nominal wfirst exoplanet microlensing survey fields @xcite field , so understanding the source distance distribution in this area of the bulge is important for wfirst .",
    "the probability distribution for the brightness of the lens star in @xmath11 and @xmath139-bands is shown in figure 6 .",
    "the blend magnitude from best fit is found @xmath147 which is brighter than the lens star magnitude predicted in table [ tab - params - histogram ] and figure 6 . since the lens - source relative proper motion is @xmath148 , the source and lens will be separated by @xmath7 hst pixel ( @xmath149 ) by 2020 . if the lens system is observed directly in high resolution images , then the brightness measurement of lens leads to the precise calculation of the mass and distance to the lens system @xcite .",

    "the uncertainty in the source brightness is measured from the markov chain links .",
    "we also include the uncertainty in the source color and magnitude .",
    "there is @xmath124 uncertainty in the color conversion from the extinction corrected @xmath152 to @xmath151 .",
    "the red lines in figure 6 is such that if lens is at least as bright as the red lines ( _ i.e. _ it lies in the red - shaded region ) then lens+source brightness is brighter than the 3-@xmath107 upper limit on the source brightness .",
    "this would mean that the lens could be detected when it is still unresolved from the source .",
    "since most of the lens flux histogram lies to the right of the red - shaded region , the lens is likely to be too faint to be detected in high resolution images unless lens and source are partially resolved . since the relative lens - source proper motion , @xmath158mas / yr , the lens and source are expected to be resolvable by jwst , hst or adaptive optics imaging some in 6 - 8 years after peak magnification , in 2020 - 2022 .",
    "@xcite derived a mass ratio function from planets detected in moa - ii survey data , and discovered a break in the mass ratio function at @xmath159 .",
    "the ogle-2014-blg-1760 lb planetary mass ratio of @xmath160 is above the mass ratio break @xmath161 .",
    "this is close to jupiter s mass ratio , but the host star probably has a mass of @xmath162 , so this planet is probably a low - mass gas giant , like saturn .",
    "follow up observations with jwst , hst or adaptive optics in 2020 - 2022 should be able to measure the lens brightness and determine the planetary mass and distance using the methods of @xcite and @xcite . later with wfirst @xcite , a similar kind of study will provide the statistics needed to determine the planetary mass function as a function of the host star mass and distance .",

    "<S> we present the analysis of the planetary microlensing event ogle-2014-blg-1760 , which shows a strong light curve signal due to the presence of a jupiter mass - ratio planet . </S>",
    "<S> one unusual feature of this event is that the source star is quite blue , with @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this is marginally consistent with source star in the galactic bulge , but it could possibly indicate a young source star in the far side of the disk . assuming a bulge source , we perform a bayesian analysis assuming a standard galactic model , and this indicates that the planetary system resides in or near the galactic bulge at @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . it also indicates a host star mass of @xmath2 , a planet mass of @xmath3 , and a projected star - planet separation of @xmath4au . </S>",
    "<S> the lens - source relative proper motion is @xmath5 mas / yr . the lens ( and stellar host star ) is predicted to be very faint , so it is most likely that it can detected only when the lens and source stars are partially resolved . due to the relatively high relative proper motion , </S>",
    "<S> the lens and source will be resolved to about @xmath6mas in 6 - 8 years after the peak magnification . </S>",
    "<S> so , by 2020 - 2022 , we can hope to detect the lens star with deep , high resolution images . </S>"
