    "the optical to x - ray continuum of 034 is highly unusual for a seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "the optical / uv continua of most agn rise towards the blue with a slope @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the spectral index , defined such that @xmath9 ) , while the soft x - ray spectrum falls towards high energies with spectral index @xmath10 ( e.g.  laor et al .",
    "the spectrum seems to peak in the unobservable euv and this continuous , optical to soft x - ray feature , known as the `` big blue bump '' , is believed to represent the emission from a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk .    in 034",
    ", however , the optical / uv continuum is flat ( @xmath11 ) , with no sign of the big blue bump down to ly@xmath8 . at @xmath12 kev , the soft x - ray spectrum is very strong above the extrapolated level of the optical / uv continuum , peaking at @xmath13 kev then falls steeply towards higher energies ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "puchnarewicz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that the accretion disk component in 034 is one of the hottest observed in agn , so that its high - energy turnover is measurable in the soft x - rays rather than the uv band .",
    "they inferred a high accretion rate ( @xmath14@xmath15 @xmath16 ) , a small black hole ( bh ) mass @xmath17 and an inclination angle @xmath18@xmath19 .",

    "( 2001 ) with an underlying power - law component extending from the optical to hard x - rays , in addition to the optically thick disk spectrum .",
    "however , they could find no satisfactory physical explanation for this feature .",
    "breeveld & puchnarewicz ( 1998 ) detected no significant polarization in the optical , making a synchrotron origin unlikely .    in this letter",
    ", we suggest a different interpretation of the continuum spectrum : we show that the flat optical spectrum is consistent with the continuum emission of an irradiated disk , with no need to invoke an additional power - law component .",
    "we also revise the estimate for the central mass , and note that low inclination viewing angles can not be ruled out .",
    "optical spectra of 034 were obtained on 1996 march 24 with the isis spectrograph mounted on the william herschel telescope at la palma ( in service observing mode ) .",
    "the spectrum , which covered the range 38007000  , is clearly contaminated by light from the host galaxy , particularly in the red . in order to remove the extended galactic emission ,",

    "in puchnarewicz et al .  ( 2001 ) , lecs and mecs spectra were fitted with a number of models ( see their table 4 ) including power - law and single - temperature blackbody components .",
    "the best fit to the soft spectrum was obtained with two blackbody components and a power law , with a column density fixed at the galactic value ( @xmath42 @xmath22 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we want to test our hypothesis that the optical - to - x - ray continuum spectrum is dominated by an optically thick accretion disk . this would be analogous to galactic bh candidates in the soft spectral state .",
    "therefore , we fitted the _ beppo - sax _ spectra with a multi - temperature disk blackbody plus a power law , using xspec version 11.0.1 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "this phenomenological model can be taken as an approximation of the spectrum produced by an accretion disk plus a hot comptonising region .",
    "the disk is responsible for the soft emission ; part of the soft photons are inverse - compton scattered to the hard x - ray band as they cross the hot corona .",
    "we also fitted the data with the more physical comptonisation model of titarchuk ( 1994 ) ( comptt in xspec ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the two models are listed in table 1 , and the spectrum fitted with disk blackbody plus power law is shown in figure 1 ( top ) .",
    "we fitted the lecs and mecs data simultaneously ( using 0.1310 kev for lecs , and 0.910 kev for mecs ) , and we applied a constant factor of 0.9 in the relative normalisation of the two instruments ( fiore et al .",
    "for both the models presented here , the best - fit intrinsic column density converged to 0 ; we have therefore fixed the column density to the galactic value . for the disk plus power - law model ,",
    "the power - law spectral index @xmath43 ( photon index @xmath44 ) is softer than for typical agn ( as previously suggested by pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) .",
    "puchnarewicz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) claimed that there is firm evidence of a hardening in the spectrum at energies @xmath45 kev ; they suggested that a harder power - law component dominates at higher energies , and that the same power - law component may explain the optical spectrum if it extends to those lower energies .",
    "a hint of an upturn in the spectrum for @xmath46 kev is indeed visible in figure 1 .",
    "however , given the low signal - to - noise ratio in the higher energy channels , and the fact that the upturn is evident only in the lecs data ( less reliable at those energies ) , we prefer not to speculate on the physical reasons for the possible existence of a hard component .",
    "we also used the best - fit parameters inferred from the _ beppo - sax _ data ( table 1 ) to re - fit the _ asca_/gis data from 1994 november , previously discussed in pounds et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and puchnarewicz et al .",
    "the result is shown in figure 1 ( bottom ) ; we obtain @xmath47 ( 117 d.o.f . ) for the disk blackbody plus power - law model . again , although there may be marginal evidence for a hardening of the spectrum at @xmath48 kev , the signal - to - noise ratio is too low to allow a meaningful interpretation .",
    "a significant result from both models is the strong constraint on the temperature at the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "we obtain @xmath49 kev .",
    "this is also in agreement with earlier _ rosat _ ( puchnarewicz et al .  1998 ) and _ asca _ ( pounds et al .",

    "2001 ) observations .",
    "we shall use this firm result as we model the disk spectrum in the optical band .",
    "the effective temperature of an accretion disk photosphere at each radius is determined by the thermal energy generated by local viscous dissipation near the disk mid - plane ( viscous heating ) , as well as by the energy intercepted from the central x - ray source , thermalised and re - emitted ( irradiative heating ) .    in the absence of irradiation , the effective temperature of a geometrically thin ,",
    "optically thick disk is ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; see also , e.g. , frank , king & raine 1992 )    @xmath50^{1/4},\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is a critical radius ( @xmath52 ) beyond which we assume no further viscous dissipation in the accretion flow , and @xmath53 is the mass accretion rate at radius @xmath54 .",
    "the contribution of the irradiation to the effective temperature is ( e.g. , king 1998 ) :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the efficiency of conversion of accreted mass into energy , @xmath57 is the central mass accretion rate ( @xmath58 if some mass is lost in a disk wind ) , @xmath59 is the albedo of the disk surface , @xmath60 is the disk scale - height at radius @xmath54 .",
    "the index @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) depends on the geometry of accretion ( vrtilek et al .",
    "1990 ; van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "the last two factors on the right hand side of equation ( 2 ) depend on the disk thickness and the amount of disk flaring ( a more concave disk intercepts a larger fraction of radiation ) .",
    "they vary only slowly with @xmath54 ; following king ( 1998 ) , we approximate them with a constant factor @xmath63 , with @xmath64 for a thin disk . hence , @xmath65 while @xmath66 ; this implies that irradiative heating dominates at large radii , and viscous heating at small radii .",
    "henceforth , we shall also assume that @xmath67 , and re - write the mass accretion rate in terms of the emitted luminosity : @xmath68 @xmath69 , with @xmath70 erg s@xmath71 .",

    "equation ( 7 ) is sometimes modified with the introduction of a spectral hardening factor @xmath88 ( ebisuzaki , hanawa & sugimoto 1984 ; shimura & takahara 1995 ) , to take into account compton scattering in the disk .",
    "we can write the `` diluted disk blackbody '' specific flux as :    @xmath89    with @xmath90 ( shimura & takahara 1995 )    our goal is to check if a disk blackbody or a diluted disk blackbody spectrum can explain the observed optical / uv / soft x - ray continuum .",
    "we have compared the observed fluxes @xmath91 with the values predicted by equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) , for various values of the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath82 . using the results of our x - ray spectral fitting",

    "we show in figure 2 that the continuum spectrum at energies @xmath95 kev can be well fitted by a diluted disk blackbody spectrum ( thick solid line ) with @xmath96 , and best - fit parameters listed in table 2 . for @xmath97 kev ,",
    "the thick solid line plotted in figure 2 represents the best fit to the _ beppo - sax _ x - ray data , discussed in section 3 .",
    "the model parameters in table 2 imply @xmath98 kev . for @xmath99 , it is @xmath100 , while for @xmath101 , @xmath102 . therefore , unlike what was claimed in puchnarewicz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we can not rule out that the system is seen face - on ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "this would explain why the molecular torus does not block out the x - ray emission from the central source .",
    "it has been suggested ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ; boller et al .",
    "1997 ) that narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies are generally seen face - on .    if we assume a simple disk blackbody spectrum instead ( @xmath104 ) , it is clear from equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) that the same fit can be obtained with @xmath105 k , @xmath106 ( @xmath107 for @xmath99 ) , with the other parameters fixed as above .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath108 kev .",
    "in fact , we can obtain good fits for @xmath109 kev by varying @xmath88 between 1.5 and 1 .",
    "given the uncertainty in the distance and in the hardening factor , we can not constrain the inclination angle more strongly .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 provides the size of the disk region dominated by irradiative heating . in our best fit ,",
    "the disk is irradiatively dominated for @xmath110 .",
    "small changes in the parameter @xmath76 have large effects on the predicted optical spectrum . in figure 2",
    ", we also plot the spectrum obtained with @xmath111 ( marked with `` b '' ; irradiation dominating for @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 ( marked with `` c '' ; irradiation dominating for @xmath114 ) . using equation ( 5 )",
    ", we see that the best - fit value of @xmath76 is consistent with @xmath115 , as expected .    we can obtain a stronger constraint on the central mass by inserting our best - fit value of @xmath75 into equation ( 4 ) :    @xmath116    for the high accretion rates observed in this system ( @xmath117 , see e.g. puchnarewicz et al .",
    "2001 ) , and for @xmath118 , we can constrain the mass of the central object to be @xmath119 .    a simple physical interpretation of @xmath120",
    "is that it corresponds to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit around the central bh .",
    "however , the standard disk model is probably not applicable near the inner disk radius , and in any case it has to be modified with relativistic terms ( e.g. , novikov & thorne 1973 ; riffert & herold 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , our spectral fit near the peak of the blackbody component ( at @xmath121@xmath122 kev ) can only be a general approximation .",
    "a more exact modelling is left to further work , and will require more precise observational data in the soft x - ray band .",
    "nevertheless , we can check that our best - fit value of @xmath123 cm is consistent with the range of values for @xmath124 derived before . if @xmath125 , @xmath120 is consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit of a schwarzschild bh , while if @xmath126 we require a kerr bh with angular parameter @xmath127 .",
    "the outer disk radius is also constrained by our fit : we require @xmath128 cm @xmath129 @xmath130 . if we keep all other parameters in table 2 fixed , but assume a disk truncated at @xmath131 cm , we can not reproduce the flat optical spectrum ( curve marked `` a '' in figure 2 ) .",
    "a large accretion disk heated by soft x - rays intercepted from the central source is likely to have a temperature - inversion layer at its surface ( wu et al .",
    "therefore , we expect strong emission - line formation at large radii . in particular , in the case of 034 , the largest contribution to low - ionisation lines such as h@xmath8 and h@xmath59 would come from radii @xmath132 cm , where the keplerian rotational velocities are @xmath133 km s@xmath71 . if the balmer lines are indeed produced near the disk surface , we expect full widths at half maximum @xmath134 km s@xmath71 .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed values of 1500 and 1800 km s@xmath71 for h@xmath59 and h@xmath8 respectively ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "moreover , if the x - ray luminosity from the central source is @xmath135 @xmath16 , we may expect the formation of a radiatively - driven accretion disk wind .",
    "accurate modelling of the emission - line profiles may help us ascertain if higher - ionisation lines are formed in the wind , and determine the ionisation parameter of the emission regions .",
    "the narrow , single - peaked uv lines seen by puchnarewicz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) appear qualitatively consistent with the disk - wind model of murray & chiang ( 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of broad and narrow components in the uv lines may be explained with a broad component emitted near the irradiated disk surface at smaller radii , and a narrow component emitted in the photoionised wind .",
    "a full investigation of this issue is beyond the scope of this letter and is left to further work .",
    "we have fitted the optical to x - ray continuum spectrum of the narrow - line seyfert 1 034 with an irradiated disk blackbody component ( temperature @xmath136 kev at the inner disk radius ) , and a power - law - like comptonised component at higher energies .",
    "the disk component is much stronger and found at higher energies than in the average agn ; the spectral index of the power - law component is @xmath137 ( steeper than the average value for an agn ) ; the observed luminosity is close to the eddington limit .",
    "we infer a central mass of @xmath119 .",
    "the observed flat optical / uv spectrum is explained by our model as emission from the radiatively - heated outer part of the disk , at @xmath110 , where @xmath138 .",
    "strong emission lines are likely to be formed near the irradiated surface of the outer disk , and in a radiatively - driven wind .",
    "our model requires the disk to extend to @xmath139 cm .",
    "the observed flux and inner - disk temperature do not rule out the hypothesis of a face - on system , which would be in agreement with the low line - of - sight absorption seen in the x - ray spectra .",
