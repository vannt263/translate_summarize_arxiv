    "the detection of air showers induced by ultra - high energy neutrinos may help to solve many important problems , such as propagation of cosmic neutrinos to the earth and their interactions with the nucleons at energies around tens ( hundreds ) of tev . in this energy region , neutrino - nucleon interactions may be strong due to a new physics",
    ". there is a large class of models in a space - time with extra spacial dimensions which result in a new tev phenomenology . in the present paper",
    "we will consider an approach with non - factorizable metric proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and study a scattering of the sm fields in this scenario .",
    "the rs model  @xcite is a model of gravity in a slice of a 5-dimensional anti - de - sitter space ( ads@xmath1 ) with a single extra dimension compactified to the orbifold @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath16    by using a linear expansion of the metric , one can derive the interaction lagrangian : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a physical scale on the tev brane .",
    "it can be chosen as small as 1 tev for a thick slice of the ads@xmath1 , @xmath19 .",
    "we see from that couplings of all massive states are only suppressed by @xmath20 , while the zero mode couples with usual strength defined by the reduced planck mass @xmath21 .",
    "the main phenomenological parameters of the model are the scale @xmath22 and the ratio @xmath23 the present experimental data together with theoretical bounds on the curvature of the ads@xmath1 restrict an allowed region for the variable @xmath24 ( see , for instance , fig .",

    "thus , the lightest masses of the kk graviton modes , @xmath26 , are of the order of 1 tev .",
    "our paper has the following structure . in the next section",
    "we consider interactions of the sm fields on the brane in the rs model induced by an exchange of massive gravitons . the eikonal amplitude is calculated and an elastic cross section for different sets of the rs parameters and/or invariant energy is estimated . in sec .",
    "3 we use these results to study the scattering of ultra - high energy cosmic neutrino off the atmospheric nucleons . the neutrino - nucleon cross section is calculated and an event rate of quasi - horizontal neutrino events expected at the auger observatory is presented .",
    "our conclusions and discussions is a topic of sect .  4 .",
    "in what follows , we will employ the zero width approximation for the graviton kk resonances .",
    "the born amplitude corresponding to @xmath0-channel exchange looks like ( both the massless mode and kk gravitons contribute ) : @xmath27 the sum in converges very rapidly in @xmath28 , since @xmath29  @xcite .",
