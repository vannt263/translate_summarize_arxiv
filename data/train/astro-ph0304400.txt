    "as low- and intermediate - mass stars enter the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) of evolution , they enshroud themselves in dusty cocoons created by heavy mass loss in the form of stellar winds .",
    "such winds gradually deplete the hydrogen envelopes of the stars , exposing their hot cores and causing the stars to increase in temperature . as the envelopes continue to thin as the result of nuclear burning and mass loss",
    ", the stellar temperature eventually increases to the extent that significant ultraviolet photons are emitted .",
    "the onset of photoionization leads to strong line emission from the circumstellar material , producing a planetary nebula ( pn ) .    in the past 25 years",
    ", significant progress has been made in the understanding of both the evolution of the central star and the dynamical evolution of the nebula .",
    "it is now believed that , in most cases , the pn central star is powered by hydrogen shell burning , and that the dynamics and the morphology of the nebula are driven by an interacting winds process ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "while the one - dimensional structures ( including shells , crowns , haloes , etc . ) can be understood by the coupled stellar and nebular evolution models @xcite , the origin of the variety of two - dimensional structures is still an unresolved mystery .",
    "the observed morphologies of pn range from round to elliptical to bipolar to point symmetric , whereas their progenitors , the agb stars , show spherical symmetry in their envelopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although it is certain that the interacting winds process plays a role in the shaping of the nebula @xcite , the exact details on how and when such shaping occurs remain unknown .",
    "the study of proto - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) , the transitional objects between the agb and pn phases , is crucial to an understanding of the processes that shape pns .",
    "pn morphologies must be created or enhanced during this transitional phase .",
    "ppns have recently been imaged in visible light with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and found to display many of the same shapes as the pns @xcite .",
    "many show bipolar reflection nebulae , some with concentric arcs and `` searchlight beams '' @xcite . in these",
    ", there appears to be a higher density of material in the equatorial region forming an optically - thick dust cocoon , with low - density lobes in the polar directions .",
    "the bipolarity observed in ppns suggests that the shaping of pns is established early in the transitional phase .",
    "in this paper we present a high spatial resolution , near - infrared _ hst _ imaging and polarization study of four ppns , each of which has recently been studied with high spatial resolution visible imaging .",
    "three of these display a dark lane in the visible images that obscures the central star . in the near - infrared",
    ", one can probe the structure of the circumstellar shell closer to the central star than can be done in visible light .",
    "one of our observational goals was to detect the central stars and determine their precise locations . with the polarization observations we wanted to investigate the scattering geometry ,",
    "locate the position of the central star from the polarization vectors , learn about the properties of the dust grains , and see if there was evidence to support the model of a circumstellar torus in the systems .",
    "the only ppn for which a detailed high - resolution near - infrared imaging and polarization study has been published is afgl 2688 ( egg nebula ) , and in this case the central star was not seen in the near - infrared @xcite . as part of our program of high - resolution near - infrared imaging and polarimetry of ppns , we have also presented preliminary results for three other ppns @xcite . with an increased sample ,",
    "we hope to better understand the properties of the circumstellar material of ppns and the cause of the development of asymmetry in pns .",
    "high - resolution near - infrared observations of these four ppns were obtained in 1998 with the near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer ( nicmos ) on board the _ hst _ under general observer program i d no .",
    "7840 ( pi : kwok ) .",
    "nicmos camera 2 ( nic2 ) was used , which has a very high resolution ( @xmath2 ) and a 195 @xmath3 193 field of view @xcite .",
    "observations were made with a broad - band _ h _ filter ( f160w ) , a medium - band _ k _ filter ( f222 m ) , and three 2 @xmath4  ( 1.9 - 2.1 @xmath4  ) polarizers ( pol0l , pol120l , pol240l ) . the data were read out using the multiple non - destructive mode ( multiaccum ) to obtain a high dynamic range without saturating the detector . an observing log , including total exposure times in the individual bandpasses , is given in table [ obslog ] .",
    "each target was imaged three successive times in each filter at different positions on the nic2 array , using a predefined spiral dither pattern .",
    "the data from the bad pixels and columns and the area blocked by the coronographic mask were compensated by the three - step dither mode .",
    "the data were processed with the standard nicmos  calnica pipeline program , which includes bias subtraction , dark subtraction , flat - field correction , cosmic - ray removal , and flux calibration .",
    "an additional effect that needed to be corrected is the so - called `` pedestal effect '' due to residual charge present in certain images @xcite . through use of the `` unpedestal '' program developed by roeland van der marel of the space telescope science institute ,",
    "most of this effect was removed .",
    "the dithered images were shifted and coadded manually using median combining . in order to combine the dithered images accurately , we first subgridded each data set by a subsample factor of two so that the peak position of field stars can be measured more precisely .",
    "the offsets between dithered images were determined by comparing the peak positions of a number of field stars and obtaining an average offset .",
    "the precision in this method of registering the dithered images can be seen from the typical rms values of the offsets in the peak positions of the field stars in an image , which are 0.040 and 0.034 pixels in the x and y directions , respectively .",
    "the distortion of the nicmos  dewar due to cryogen expansion affected its optical path .",
    "this caused the effective focal length , and hence the pixel scale , to change somewhat as a function of time during the initial active lifetime of the instrument .",
    "the plate scales were measured every two weeks during the active lifetime ; therefore , we adopted a plate scale for each observation using the measurement that was closest to the date of the observation .",
    "the nicmos  detector arrays were slightly tilted relative to the focal plane ; therefore , when projected onto the sky , the pixels are actually rectangular , not square .",
    "the x and y pixel scale differences need to be corrected to carry out precision astrometry or to accurately register nicmos images to images taken with other instruments such as the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board _",
    "hst_. these scale differences",
    "must also be accounted for when analyzing the orientation of the polarization vectors .",
    "the images were thus rescaled spatially when necessary .",
    "to remove ( or at least reduce ) extended point - spread function ( psf ) features of the nicmos , we have deconvolved the images using an iterative poisson maximum - likelihood algorithm ( task `` lucy '' in iraf ) .",
    "the psfs used in the deconvolution were generated by the tinytim program v.4.4 @xcite .",
    "the deconvolved images were only used for display purposes .",
    "all scientific measurements were done based on the original images . specific reduction and analysis of the polarimetric data",
    "are discussed separately in sec .",
    "[ polar ] .",
    "photometric measurements were made on the f160w and f222 m images of the four ppns using the calibration values listed in table [ ph_header ] .",
    "the magnitudes determined from the fits image headers ( photfnu and photflam ) are in the _ hst _ stmag system . because the nicmos  filter bandpasses do not match those of ground - based filters , it is not straightforward to derive standard infrared magnitudes .",
    "since there are no direct spectrophotometric observations of vega or other a0v standards through the nicmos  filter system , we used the flux values for a 0.0 magnitude star ( vega ) as derived by the nicmos  instrument definition team ( idt ; see table [ ph_header ] ) .",
    "standard aperture photometry was carried out on the four objects using elliptical apertures that approximately matched the size of the nebulae .",
    "apertures were chosen that were similar in size to the nebular halos measured on the visible wfpc2 images .",
    "the several bright field stars inside the apertures were excluded in calculating the total integrated counts .",
    "table [ ph_result ] lists the results of the photometric measurements and includes the aperture sizes .",
    "these magnitudes on the vega system , m@xmath5(f160w ) and m@xmath5(f222 m ) , are all close ( @xmath6 0.2 mag ) to the ground - based _ h _ and _ k _ measurements , respectively , for these objects .",
    "the brightness of each of the central stars was also measured .",
    "we used a small aperture ( 2 @xmath3 fwhm ) and applied an aperture correction based upon the measurement of a bright star in the field of iras 17150@xmath13224 .",
    "these approximate values are also listed in table [ ph_result ] ; we estimate the accuracy to be @xmath70.3 to @xmath70.4 mag , the main uncertainty being the contribution of the nebular flux .",
    "the published wfpc2 f606w ( @xmath8 0.58 @xmath0 m ) images of iras 17150@xmath13224 @xcite , iras 17441@xmath12411 @xcite , and iras 17245@xmath13951 @xcite show a prominent bipolarity in their nebulae , with a dark lane separating two opposite lobes in each .",
    "similar bipolarity is also seen in these new near - infrared images .",
    "this indicates that there exists an asymmetry in their circumstellar dust shells , with stellar light escaping from lower density regions to give rise to this bipolar nebulosity . to investigate further the presence of an asymmetry around each of these ppns , flux - ratio or color maps were computed . for these we included the previous wfpc2 f606w images .",
    "these were shifted and rotated in order to align with the f160w and f222 m images .",
    "this process was done with the iraf / immatch package , which uses three field stars that appear in all of the images as the reference points to perform geometrical transformations .",
    "since the resolutions at different wavelengths and with different filter widths are not the same , the higher - resolution wfpc2 f606w and nic2 f160w images were convolved with an extended gaussian profile to match the resolution in the nic2 f222 m image before computing the flux - ratio maps .",
    "these images and flux - ratio maps are presented and discussed for each object in the following subsections .",
    "figures 1a and 1b display the deconvolved f160w and f222 m images of iras 17150@xmath13224 ( cotton candy nebula ) .",
    "the object consists of two bipolar reflection lobes that have similar sizes in all three bandpasses ( f606w , f160w , and f222 m ) .",
    "bright `` caps '' appear at the ends of the lobes .",
    "the presence of these sharp caps strongly suggests that there exists a definite boundary to the material distribution in the polar directions rather than open - ended cavities .",
    "the bipolar lobes look like limb - brightened bubbles in the near - infrared images .",
    "thus the density inside the lobes must be very low ; they are essentially closed - end cavities .",
    "superimposed on the bipolar lobes and the surrounding halo is a series of concentric , circular arcs .",
    "six arcs are detected in the f160w image , and these correspond to the inner six arcs previously detected in the wfpc2 f606w image .",
    "this correspondence is clearly seen in the radial intensity profiles shown in figure [ 150arc ] .",
    "an average separation of 051 was obtained between the six arcs in the f160w image ; this value agrees with the separation measured in the f606w image using a similar method .",
    "these arcs appear to be portions of incomplete circles .",
    "the central star can clearly be seen in both near - infrared images , in contrast to the visible image in which the lobes were separated by a dark lane with the star obscured .",
    "the position of the central star is similar in both , with an average value of r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath9 , decl.(j2000 ) = @xmath10 .",
    "this agrees with the position of the crossing point of the searchlight beams seen in the f606w image , r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath11 and decl.(j2000 ) = @xmath12 @xcite , and confirms that the cavity which produces the beams is centered on the central star .",
    "the inner boundries of the lobes in the near - infrared and visible images appear not to be parallel or axially - symmetric but rather open widely to the sw side ( the right side in figure 1a and 1b ) .",
    "the inner bounderies appear to be brighter than the caps or the rest of the lobes in these near - infrared images .",
    "a faint loop extending from the central region toward the ene and wsw directions is found in each of the near - infrared images ; this loop is not seen in the visible image .",
    "the loop has an approximately elliptical shape centered at the central star , with a size of 111@xmath3059 ( semi - major axis@xmath3 semi - minor axis ) and a position angle ( p.a . ) of 63 .",
    "note that the major axis of the loop is not perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the bipolar lobes ( p.a .",
    "this kind of loop structure has also been seen in some young ppns ( e.g. , hubble 5 ) in visible light .",
    "figures 1c and 1d display the color or flux - ratio maps for f160w / f606w ( logarithmic scale ) and f222m / f160w ( linear scale ) . the bipolar reflection lobes and",
    "the faint arcs have bluer colors than the equatorial regions and the central star .",
    "the flux ratios in different parts of the nebula are summarized in table [ fr150 ] .",
    "the bluer colors in the bipolar lobes and the arcs are consistent with the idea that these regions are viewed in light scattered off the dust grains .",
    "the fact that the se cap is redder than the nw cap suggests that the se lobe is pointed away from us ; thus its light is further reddened by passing through more of the halo .",
    "this is consistent with the visible image in which the se lobe is fainter than the nw lobe .",
    "the reflected light from the bipolar lobes is mostly singly scattered , as deduced from the high percentage polarization seen at 2 @xmath0 m ( see section [ pol_dis ] ) .",
    "this condition can be used to set constraints on the radial extinction of starlight and the line - of - sight scattering optical depth as a function of radius from the central star .",
    "the scattering optical depth at any radius can be estimated by comparing the observed scattered light intensity to the incident stellar radiation ( e.g. , sahai et al .",
    "the observed brightness for the brighter nw lobe at 2.22 @xmath0 m is 3.5@xmath13 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath15 arcsec@xmath16 at the projected radius of 27 .",
    "the incident stellar radiation at 2.22 @xmath0 m ( 2.85 @xmath17 ergs s@xmath15 @xmath14 @xmath0m@xmath15 ) can be estimated using the bolometric flux of 5.71 @xmath18 ergs @xmath14 s@xmath15 @xcite and @xmath19 5500 k. assuming a 1/r@xmath20 density distribution , eqn ( 1 ) from @xcite gives a line - of - sight optical depth of @xmath212.2@xmath22 , which is about 200 times smaller than we observed ( @xmath23 = 4.2 ) based on the flux ratio of the whole nebula ( see the calculation below ) .",
    "this suggests that the integrated light from the nebula is mostly reddened due to the radial extinction from the star to the point where it gets scattered , and then slightly blue - ed by the scattering process .",
    "the central star is extremely red , with approximate color indices of ( _ v@xmath1h _ ) @xmath24 9 and ( _ h@xmath1k _ ) @xmath25 2.0 .",
    "the spectral type of the central star , based upon observations of scattered light from the lobes , is g2  i @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic color for an unreddened g2  i star is @xmath26=1.5 and @xmath27=0.1 ; thus the central star is highly reddened .",
    "the central star shows a f222m / f160w flux ratio of 1.2 , which is significantly larger than that expected ( 0.46 ) from its g2  i spectral type and estimated interstellar extinction ( @xmath28 1.0 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "this additional reddening can be attributed to circumstellar material , particularly in the dense equatorial region . by comparing the expected value of the f222m / f160w flux ratio ( 0.36 ) from an unreddened g2  i star ( @xmath29 ) to our observed value ( 1.2 ) , ( assuming the standard interstellar extinction curve @xcite for the nebular dust )",
    ", we find an extinction optical depth at 2.2 @xmath4  of @xmath30 and at 1.6 @xmath4  of @xmath31 toward the central star .",
    "however , the total observed flux from the object gives a f222m / f160w flux ratio of 6.3 , which gives @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath34 ratio from the central star ( 1.6 ) is smaller than that derived from the whole object , suggesting that the extinction curve between 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath4  for dust grains along the equatorial direction is flatter than the interstellar one .",
    "this flatter wavelength dependency on the extinction curve is likely due to larger grain sizes in the equatorial dense region than the typical value ( 0.1 @xmath4  ) for interstellar grains .",
    "other ppns , like the egg nebula @xcite and iras 04296 + 3429 @xcite , also show evidence for large grains in their dense equatorial regions .",
    "the flux - ratio maps reveal non - axially symmetric patterns , with the region between the lobes appearing as a red wedge opening to the sw ( right side of figure 1c and 1d ) .",
    "this suggests that the dense equatorial region ( torus ) is larger in vertical extent on this side .",
    "the f222m / f160w flux - ratio map shows a red source at the location of the central star , with additional red regions nearby on each side . to better illustrate the structures in the central part ,",
    "three intensity cuts ( 0@xmath355 wide ) through the central red source were made near the x - axis of the f222m / f160w flux - ratio map ( fig .",
    "[ 150disk ] ) .",
    "the nearby red regions appear as peaks in these cuts , with two pairs of peaks ( radii @xmath25@xmath36 and @xmath25@xmath37 ) and perhaps a third ( @xmath25@xmath38 ) seen , in addition to the central peak .",
    "the pair of peaks at radius @xmath251   is associated with the extended loop seen in the near - infrared images .",
    "the red color presumably arises from the scattering of the extremely reddened light of the central star .",
    "the possible outermost pair of peaks located at r@xmath2516 is seen primarily along one cut .",
    "these peaks arise from regions where the s / n is low in both the f160w and f222 m images .",
    "it is possible that they represent a second , outer loop , but at present we consider the physical reality of the outermost peaks to be uncertain .",
    "the inner pair of peaks may represent a cross - section of the torus .",
    "however , they have different angular separations from the central star ( @xmath25034 for ne and @xmath25052 for sw ) .",
    "if the inner pair represents the dusty torus , the non - equal separations imply that either the star is not at the center of the torus or the torus is not axially symmetric .",
    "the former of these can arise if the post - agb central star is in orbit with a binary companion .",
    "( such a companion would likely be a main - sequence or white dwarf star and therefore much fainter and not visible . )",
    "the average separation of the inner peaks translates to 6.4@xmath39 cm ( d/1 kpc ) .",
    "figures 4a and 4b show the deconvolved nic2 f160w and f222 m images of iras 17441@xmath12411 ( silkworm nebula ) .",
    "this object showed a pronounced s - shaped nebula in the visible f606w image @xcite , and this s - shaped morphology is seen in both of the near - infrared images .",
    "this morphology suggests point - symmetry in the nebula .",
    "the central star , which was not seen in the visible , is clearly resolved in both of the near - infrared images , with a position of r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath40 , decl.(j2000 ) = @xmath41 .",
    "this position agrees with the center position of the two pairs of concentric arcs seen in the f606w image , r.a.(j2000 ) = @xmath42 , decl.(j2000 ) = @xmath43 .",
    "the nebula has a similar size in all three bands ; this is to be expected when one is seeing scattering from the dense - walled lobes .",
    "figures 4c and 4d show the flux - ratio maps .",
    "the reflection lobes are bluer than the equatorial region , as is the case in iras 17150@xmath13224 .",
    "the southern lobe is redder and fainter in visible light than the northern lobe ; both of these characteristics suggests that the southern lobe is tipped away .",
    "the detailed flux ratios in different regions are listed in table [ fr441 ] .",
    "the central star is very bright in the near - infrared images , resulting in a complex psf ; hence the flux - ratio map of f222m / f160w is complicated and full of psf features ( wings and spikes ) . in an inset in figure 4c ,",
    "the intensity contours around the central star in the f160w / f606w flux - ratio map are shown .",
    "these contours appear to show an axisymmetric torus perpendicular to the lobes .",
    "thus , similar to iras 17150@xmath13224 , the color distribution in iras 17441@xmath12411 supports the model of a circumstellar torus .",
    "the central star appears extremely red ( presumably as a result of circumstellar extinction ) , with approximate values of ( _ v@xmath1h _ ) @xmath24 9 and ( _ h@xmath1k _ ) @xmath25 2.5 .      near - infrared images of iras 17245@xmath13951 ( walnut nebula ) are shown in figure [ 245hk ] .",
    "the central star , which was not seen in the visible , is clearly resolved in both of the near - infrared images , with a position of r.a.(j2000)=@xmath44 , decl.(j2000)=@xmath45 .",
    "the nebula is small and has a size in the f160w image similar to that seen in the f606w image .",
    "however , the nebula is not seen in the f222 m image ; this may be due to the fact that the image does not go as deep as the other two and partly perhaps to the relatively large effect of the complicated psf of the bright central star in the f222 m image .",
    "a jet - like structure seen in the southern lobe in the f606w image @xcite does not appear in the f160w image .",
    "figure [ 245hk]c shows the f160w / f606w flux - ratio map .",
    "the bluest colors are associated with the lobes and the reddest colors with a torus perpendicular to the lobes .",

    "the central star is seen in the f606w image , and it has been assigned a spectral type of b7 @xcite .",
    "it is reddened , with ( _ v@xmath1h _ ) @xmath25 4.2 and ( _ h@xmath1k _ ) @xmath25 0.3 .",
    "no dark lane is visible .",
    "near - infrared images of iras 16594@xmath14656 are shown in figure [ 594hk ] .",
    "the nebulosity in the f160w image bears a general resemblance to the one seen in the visible image , but does not show as much faint detail . in the f606w image , included for comparison ( fig .",
    "6c ) , the main lobes are along the ese and wnw directions with some extended structures ( `` petals '' ) along the ne and sw directions .",
    "the nebulosity seen in f160w is also elongated along the ese and wnw directions , and the petals appear very faintly .",
    "very little nebulosity is detected in the f222 m image ; this is due in part to the fact that the psf of the bright central star masks , to some extent , the light of the nebula . in the f160w / f606w flux - ratio map ,",
    "the faint petals stand out as having a bluer color than the rest of the nebula .",
    "the nicmos  polarization data of the four ppns were analyzed using the algorithm developed by @xcite to derive the stokes images ( _ i_,_q_,_u _ ) and the maps of percentage polarizations ( _ p _ ) and position angles ( @xmath46 ) . before constructing the final stokes images and percentage polarization and position angle maps , there were several additional steps in the data reduction .",
    "any sky background was removed , since this would produce a small dc offset that would introduce some artificial polarization .",
    "the sky values in each image were determined by examining several blank sky areas and an average sky value was subtracted from the image .",
    "the x and y pixel scale differences were adjusted to produce square pixels ; otherwise , a systematic offset in polarization position angle would have been introduced @xcite . in order to transform the data to square pixels",
    ", the flux of each data set was redistributed with a bicubic spline interpolation function using a task called `` imlintran '' in iraf .",
    "since the percentage polarization and position angle maps are formed by dividing one image by another image , one must be careful to avoid a run - away error , which can occur when dividing by a very small number with a relatively large uncertainty .",
    "therefore , before calculating the result maps , the three data sets were rebinned by 2x2 pixels to smooth out small fluctuations .",
    "then the threshold value for a real signal was defined as 10 @xmath47 ; any signal below 10 @xmath47 was considered as noise with zero percentage polarization",
    ".    the actual uncertainties in the polarization will be larger than the poisson errors .",
    "additional sources in the form of systematic errors include the background subtraction and the image alignment . in order to reduce possible errors in the final percentage polarization and position angle maps ,",
    "a threshold of s / n = 10 was also set in the final stokes images . as the following estimations show , with this conservative threshold , the estimated uncertainties are not important .",
    "we first added 1 @xmath47 noise to the sky - subtracted images ( pol0l , pol120l , pol240l ) and found the percentage polarization to differ only within @xmath73% .",
    "we also computed a new set of polarization maps using un - shifted data and found that the percentage polarization differs by less than 3% within the the s / n=10 threshold region , although it can increase up to 24% outside that boundry . according to the on - orbit calibration of the nicmos polarimetric capability , a total instrumental polarization of @xmath48 1%",
    "was found @xcite .",
    "since these four objects are all in the general direction of the center of the galaxy ( @xmath49 : 340@xmath50 to 4@xmath50 , @xmath51 : @xmath13.3@xmath50 to + 3.0@xmath50 ) , a small amount of polarization ( @xmath65% ) may be of interstellar origin .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , after correcting for the projection effect , rebinning , and setting the above thresholds , the uncertainty in the polarization is @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 ( the later taken from @xcite ) .      the polarization pattern for a simple reflection nebula with a central illuminating source , such as a ppn , is expected to be centrosymmetric about the illuminating star .",
    "even for a slightly more complicated system composed of a mixture of reflected central starlight and line emission from the extended nebulosity , such as is found in a young pn , one still expects to observe this centrosymmetric pattern .",
    "this is because the line - emission radiation will be unpolarized and its effect will only be to dilute the polarized scattered light @xcite .",
    "the most likely near - infrared emission line in the ppn phase is from @xmath56 , and the nic2 polarizer bandpass may admit as much as 10 % of any @xmath57emission present at 2.12 @xmath0 m . among these four ppns , only iras 17150@xmath13224 is known to have @xmath57emission .",
    "this dilution effect will be discussed in [ pol_dis ] .",
    "figure [ pol ] shows the 2 @xmath4  polarization maps for the four ppns . in this figure ,",
    "the polarization vectors are plotted as straight lines whose lengths represent the strength of the polarization ; these are superimposed on the contour images of the total flux of the light through the three polarizers ( stokes _ i _ image ) .",
    "the distribution of the polarization vectors shows a general centrosymmetric pattern around the central source in each of these ppns .",
    "this is consistent with what one would expect from a reflection nebulosity with a central illuminating source .",
    "some departure from a centrosymmetry pattern is found in the equatorial regions .",
    "this is commonly seen in the equatorial regions of bipolar reflection nebulae @xcite . in these equatorial regions ,",
    "the polarization is low ( @xmath48 10 % ) , as will be discussed below .",
    "this suggests that multiple scattering has reduced the strength of the polarization and provides further evidence for the presence of a dense circumstellar torus in these ppns .",
    "in addition to the centrosymmetry , the polarization vectors also show a strong point symmetry in the distribution of polarization strengths around the central star .",
    "this can be seen in plots of the polarization vectors within different ranges of percentage polarization .",
    "iras 17150@xmath13224 shows remarkable point symmetry , as seen in figure [ pflowa ] .",
    "the lobes and the two caps are highly polarized , with @xmath58 .",
    "the maximum percentage polarization is found at the edge of the se lobe ( the fainter lobe in the optical image ) , with @xmath59 . in general , the light from the lobes is polarized with @xmath60 ( see the combination of fig . 8a and 8b ) .",
    "lower polarization is found along the edges of the lobes .",
    "the areas with @xmath61 are located in the equatorial region . for iras",
    "17441@xmath12411 ( figure [ pflowb ] ) , the reflection lobes typically possess @xmath62 polarization .",
    "the maximum polarization is found at the bend of the s - shape in the southern lobe ( the fainter lobe in the optical image ) , with @xmath63 .",
    "similar to iras 17150@xmath13224 , lower polarization is found along the edges of the lobes and the areas associated with the lowest polarization ( @xmath61 ) are located in the equatorial region .    for iras",
    "17245@xmath13951 ( figure [ pflowc ] ) , the higher polarization ( @xmath64 ) is found near the ends of the nebular lobes .",
    "again , the low polarization ( @xmath61 ) region is associated with the equatorial direction . for iras",
    "16594@xmath14656 ( figure [ pflowd ] ) , the higher polarization region ( @xmath65 ) is found to be associated with the edges of the nebula and the maximum polarization is found in the eastern lobe",
    ". the vectors also show a general centrosymmetric pattern .",
    "since the nebula is oriented at an intermediate inclination @xcite , the torus is no longer edge - on and the low polarization ( @xmath61 ) region is distributed around the central star .      in figure [ p_percent ] are shown the percentage polarization maps for the iras 17150@xmath13224 and iras 17441@xmath12411 .",
    "one can clearly see the highly polarized regions at the ends and the edges of the lobes in iras 17150@xmath13224 .",
    "note that @xmath57emission is observed in iras 17150@xmath13224 @xcite .",
    "the strongest @xmath57emission is seen from the polar caps , which are among the regions with the largest polarization strength ( @xmath25 60@xmath176 % ) .",
    "however , the total flux contributed by the @xmath57emission is low compared to the total flux through three polarizers ( @xmath252.3 % )",
    ". the undiluted percentage polarization should be higher by only @xmath251 % .",
    "comparison of our _ hst _ imaging polarimetry with that obtained from the ground shows the advantages of the high _ hst _ spatial resolution when observing small nebulae such as ppns .",
    "@xcite carried out ground - based near - infrared ( _ j_-band ) imaging polarimetry for three of these ppns .",
    "they found the polarization vectors distributed in an elliptical pattern aligned orthogonal to the polar axis of each nebula , rather than in the general centrosymmetric pattern found in these _ hst _ nicmos observations .",
    "this can be quite easily understood as the result of the lower spatial resolution ( by a factor of five ) of their observations , which results in spatial smearing of the vectors ( see @xcite , fig .",
    "similarly , their values ( at 1.25 @xmath0 m ) for the maximum observed polarization are less than these _ hst _ values ( at 2.0 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "this is also likely due to spatial smearing of the polarization values and to the greater effect of dilution on the polarization values by the unpolarized light of the central stars in their lower - resolution images .",
    "these effects will be greatest for the small nebula of iras 17245@xmath13951 .",
    "( this difference in the maximum observed polarization values is not due to the difference in wavelengths observed , since these authors also observed some ppns in both _",
    "j _ and _ k _ ( 2.2 @xmath0 m ) and found the maximum observed polarization at _ k _ to be comparable to or less than that at _ j _ ) .",
    "the polarization maps depend on the dust grain properties , in additional to the density structure of the nebulae .",
    "we therefore use the monte carlo multiple - scattering models developed for bipolar nebulae @xcite around young stellar objects ( ysos ) , since these are morphologically rather similar to ppns for which such models are not available . with these",
    "we analyze our polarimetric images and infer rough constraints on the dust properties of our ppns .",
    "first , one can get some constraints on the grain albedo .",
    "@xcite simulated k - band images for low albedo ( @xmath66 = 0.22 ) and high albedo ( @xmath66 = 0.8 ) dust grains ( see their fig .",
    "the low albedo image shows pinched - in , bipolar - like intensity contours in the equatorial plane for a near edge - on system , while the high albedo image shows more elliptical - like contours .",
    "since iras 17150@xmath13224 and iras 17441@xmath12411 appear bipolar , low albedo grains are likely to be dominant in these two .",
    "furthermore , a lower albedo in the k band is consistent with single scattering of the photons , since a high albedo would lead to multiple scattering and a lower value for the maximum observed percentage polarization .",
    "the values of the observed percentage polarization are very high for these ppns .",
    "both the high values of the observed percentage polarization and the pinched - in morphologies infer that low albedo grains are dominant in these ppns .",
    "a similar result was also found in another ppn , roberts 22 @xcite .",
    "the value of the maximum linear percentage polarization ( @xmath67 ) is a function of the grain size and thus can be used to constrain the size of the grains present .",
    "the value of @xmath67 is the highest percentage level of polarization that can be produced by single scattering , and the maximum observed value of the percentage polarization provides a lower limit to @xmath67 . in table",
    "[ pmax ] are listed the observed maximum values of the polarization ( @xmath67(obs ) ) for these four ppns and the egg nebula ( for comparison ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the percentage polarization produced by scattering though 90  using particles of different radii @xmath68 ( see their fig .",
    "they found that for spherical silicate grains ( with refractive index m = 1.7 @xmath1 0.03_i _ ) , @xmath67 is 100 % for grains with radii @xmath69 0.3 @xmath0 m but then drops off rapidly for larger grains .",
    "( for a metallic dust mixture ( m = 1.7 @xmath1 0.6_i _ ) this size constraint is removed since they maintain high polarization for a wide range of sizes . )",
    "thus , if we assume silicate grains ( silicate absorption at 9.7 @xmath0 m is observed in iras 17150@xmath13224 ; @xcite ) , then these high observed maximum polarization values indicate that the dust must be dominated by small grains in the scattering envelope ( the bipolar lobes and halo ) .",
    "table [ pmax ] also includes the location in the bipolar nebulae where the observed maximum polarization is found and the nebular size in visible light . except for iras 17245@xmath13951 ,",
    "the observed maximum polarization is found associated with the fainter lobe for each of these bipolar nebulae . in an axisymmetric distribution of dust illuminated by a central source and",
    "inclined to our line of sight ,",
    "if the fainter lobe is more polarized than the brighter lobe , the most likely explanation is that the grains are forward scattering .",
    "this is because with forward scattering , the scattered flux is weighted toward small scattered angles @xcite .",
    "thus the comparison of these near - infrared images and polarization maps with models developed for ysos suggests that the dust in the scattering envelope is dominated by small , forward - scattering grains ( radii @xmath69 0.3 @xmath0 m for silicates ) with low albedos .",
    "a high - resolution near - infrared imaging and polarization study of four bipolar ppns has been carried out using nicmos on the _ hst_. in the three nearly edge - on nebulae , the central stars are seen for the first time in these near - infrared images .",
    "( this is in contrast to the egg nebula , which appears similar in visible light but in which the central star is not seen in the near - infrared . )",
    "all four show a general centrosymmetric pattern in their polarization vectors , indicating that one is seeing light from the central star that has been singly - scattered from the dust grains .",
    "the nebular size is the same in the near - infrared images as in the previous visible _ hst _ images , consistent with scattering from dense - walled lobes .",
    "color maps show that the light from the lobes is bluer than from the central region , and the polarization images show that the lobes are highly polarized ( @xmath2440% for iras 17150@xmath13224 and iras 17441@xmath12411 ) .",
    "these all indicate that the lobes are seen almost entirely in scattered light and that any emission sources in the lobes are faint .",
    "the dark region between the lobes is very red in the color maps and the polarization there is weak and deviates from the centrosymmetric pattern ; these are consistent with the presence of a dense torus that lies perpendicular to the bipolar lobes and causes multiple scattering in the emergent light .",
    "the limb - brightening of the lobes seen in iras 17150@xmath13224 suggests that they possess low density and are viewed primarily in light scattered from the cavity walls .",
    "furthermore , the cap structures indicate that these cavities are not open - ended cones .",
    "an extended loop was discovered along the equatorial direction in this object .",
    "in addition to the centrosymmetric polarization patterns , point - symmetric patterns are also seen among the polarization vectors for these four ppns .",
    "this is particularly striking for iras 17150@xmath13224 , the largest of the edge - on nebulae , and was seen previously in the egg nebula @xcite .",
    "such point - symmetric structures resemble the bret ( bipolar , rotating , episodic jets ) phenomenon observed in pns @xcite , and suggest that the mechanism responsible for producing such structures is already operating in ppns .",
    "although it is unclear at this time whether the bret phenomenon is related to the multipolar lobes observed in pn 2440 @xcite and in low - excitation ( and young ) pns @xcite , our present data suggest that colliminated bipolar outflows commence early in the post - agb evolution .",
    "the results in this paper increase the number of detailed high - resolution near - infrared imaging and polarization studies carried out with the _ hst _ from one ( the egg nebula , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to five .",
    "our observations confirm the basic model of ppns in which an equatorial region of enhanced density ( torus ) obscures the central star in visible light and in which light escaping in the polar directions scatters from the walls of polar cavities carved out by a fast wind .",
    "these results agree with other recent observations that show that the morphological shaping of pn occurs early , before the onset of photoionization .",
    "this model can be further tested by comparing the high - resolution mid - infrared images of pn and ppns that are starting to be obtained with the new 8@xmath110 m telescopes .",
