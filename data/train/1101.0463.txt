    "transiting exoplanets are unique targets for which we can measure the planetary radius by high accuracy photometry when the planet passes in front of its host star and its mass and orbital characteristics ( eccentricity , alignment with the spin of the star ) by doppler measurements of the host star .",
    "thus it is possible to compute the mean density of the planet and to model its internal structure or to explore the composition and characteristics of its atmosphere ( albedo , temperature , and atmospheric composition ) by photometry or spectroscopy observations during the transit or the eclipse .",
    "+ _ corot _ ( baglin et al .",
    "2006 ; deleuil et al . , this book )",
    "is the first space - based photometric survey dedicated to finding transiting exoplanets . _",
    "corot _ finds about 250 objects per run whose light curves show transit - like events .",
    "most of them are clear eclipsing binaries ( eb ) , but when a target shows periodic single transits ( i.e. no secondary transits ) , no ellipsoidal variations and a shape , duration , and depth compatible with a transiting exoplanet , we consider it as a transiting exoplanet candidate . but",
    "these planetary candidates could still be mimicked by a transiting low - mass star , a grazing eb , a main sequence star eclipsing a giant star , or by an eb diluted by a third star .",
    "these eb scenarii ( about 50% of candidates ) could be resolved by high - resolution spectroscopy observations in order to discard all binary scenarii ( sb1 , sb2 , sb3 , ... ) .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ transitscenarii ] shows the result of the ccf of a transiting candidate followed - up with sophie . when eb scenarii are discarded ,",
    "precise rv observations are required to measure the mass of the transiting object and characterize its orbit .",
    "[ transitscenarii ]",
    "precise rv follow - up observations are obtained using a network of 3 spectrographs that share candidates in a optimized way depending on the brightness of the host star and the shallowness of the candidate :      sophie ( bouchy et al 2009a ) is a high - accuracy fiber - fed echelle spectrograph mounted on the 1.93-m telescope in haute - provence observatory , france .",
    "sophie has a resolution of @xmath0 ( in high - resolution mode ) or @xmath1 ( in high - efficiency mode ) at 550 nm . due to the faintness of the _ corot _ targets",
    ", we used only the high - efficiency mode of sophie which has an intrinsic stability of about @xmath2 .",
    "we observe with sophie all transiting planetary candidates up to v - magnitude of 15 .",
    "about 13 nights per semester since 2007 are dedicated to the _ corot _ follow - up and permit to confirm and characterize some of the _ corot _ exoplanets discovered so far ( e.g. fig .",

    "harps ( mayor et al .",
    "2003 ) is a high - accuracy fiber - fed echelle spectrograph mounted on the eso 3.6-m telescope in la silla observatory , chile .",
    "harps has a resolution of @xmath3 ( in high - accuracy mode ) or @xmath4 ( in eggs mode ) at 550 nm .",
    "we can follow targets up to v - magnitude of 16 but we focus on the shallowest candidates or on candidates with the longest period around the brightest targets . a large program of 16 nights per semester is dedicated to this program on harps and permitted to establish or confirm the planetary nature of most of the _ corot _ exoplanets discovered so far ( e.g. fig . [ harps - hires ] )      the keck / hires observations were obtained as part of nasa s key science project to support the _ corot _ mission .",
    "hires is a high - resolution , optical spectrograph ( vogt et al . 1994 ) mounted on the 10 m keck 1 telescope on the summit of mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we use hires in combination with an iodine cell to obtain highly precise rv measurements .",
    "we use hires with the 0.86 arcsec slit that yields a resolving power of @xmath5 at 550 nm .",
    "the 10-m aperture of keck permits us to follow - up some candidates that are too faint for harps ( v - magnitude @xmath6 ) . in some cases ,",
    "keck / hires could observe rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) anomaly with a better time resolution than harps or to obtain a high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) spectrum of the host star needed to characterize the star parameters .",
    "about 5 nights per semester are allocated on keck for _ corot _ targets permit to confirm and characterize some of the _ corot _ exoplanets discovered so far ( e.g. fig . [ harps - hires ] on right ) .      due to the large _ corot _ psf ,",
    "the first step of follow - up process is to re - observe the transit with a higher spatial resolution in order to discard all background eclipsing binaries ( beb ) that could cause the transit ( deeg et al .",
    "then , two high - resolution rv observations are scheduled at the extrema phase of the planetary orbit ( assuming a circular orbit ) , corresponding to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the period and the epoch of the transit determined from the _ corot _ lc analysis and @xmath11 is the number of orbits since @xmath10 .",
    "these two rv measurements are sufficient in most cases to estimate the nature of the transiting object : large rv variations of several @xmath12 in phase with the _ corot _ ephemeris indicate an eb ( sb1 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ transitscenarii ] .",
    "small rv variations of less than a few @xmath12 are compatible with a planetary nature and require more observations to be confirmed .",
    "mass characterization of low - mass planets strongly depends on the star brightness and its rotational velocity .",
    "table [ photonoise ] indicates photon noise uncertainties on sophie and harps in one hour exposure time for 3 different @xmath13 and different v - magnitudes .",
    "transiting super - earths ( @xmath14 ) can only be characterized around low - rotating stars brighter than mv=13 , while transiting hot - neptune ( @xmath15 ) can be characterized with harps on stars up to mv=14 . for stars fainter than mv=14 , or fast - rotating stars , only giant planets and brown dwarves can be characterized .",
    ".sophie and harps photon noise in 1 hour exposure time in @xmath16 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      due to the faintness of the _ corot _ target , observations are mostly scheduled in dark time ( i.e. , when the moon is set ) .",
    "the moon background light ( mbl ) that is blended the target spectrum can affect the rv measurement of up to several @xmath12 as one can see in fig .",
    "[ corot10 ] .",
    "the correction consists in subtracting the ccf of the sky observed simultaneously to the ccf of the target ( for more details , see bonomo et al 2010 ) .      in the case of a triple system or an unresolved beb",
    ", the spectrum of the main star could be blended with the spectrum of the eclipsing binary and it can affect the rv measurements of the main star ( bouchy et al 2009b ) . this kind of scenario can mimic the rv signature of a planetary companion , but produces asymmetries in the ccf in phase with the orbital period ( see fig .",
    "[ beb ] ) , or different rv amplitudes when computing the ccf with masks from different spectral types which can detect blending stars with different @xmath17 ( see fig .",

    "corot_. this is mostly caused by blended binaries : a contaminating eb at the _ corot _ period and a binary with a different period .",
    "[ murphy ] shows two of these cases where the transit is explained by a beb .",
    "for the first one ( left panel ) , the background binary is separated by a few arcsec ( within the _ corot _ photometric mask ) and for the second , the two binaries are located inside the seeing disk ( tal - or et al . , in prep ) .",
    "corot-7 is an active star which hosts at least 2 super - earths .",
    "stellar activity induces rv signatures ( see fig .",
    "[ corot7 ] ) at the level of a few @xmath18 . to dissociate stellar activity from planetary signature ,",
