    "localized and labyrinth structures in excitable media are considered to be used as carriers of binary information for specific applications @xcite .",
    "such structures appear in monostable and bistable regimes of magnetic , electrical , chemical , and optical systems .",
    "in particular , different realizations of memory and logic elements with bubble - forming bistable media seem to be technologically promising because of a high stability of the bubble structures .",
    "prototype bubble - forming systems are 2d ferromagnets including ferrofluids @xcite , and 2d ferroelectrics including electrically active liquid crystals @xcite . in critical parameter ranges , these systems create pattern structures ( lamellae , labyrinths ) which are not periodic @xcite . to be precise",
    ", i mention that experimental observation of bubbles and lamellar patterns in solid ferroelectric films does not manage ( unlike in liquid crystals where electro - elastic coupling is weaker ) @xcite , although a 2d bubble like structure has been seen in a system of a finite - size geometry @xcite . unlike patterns in oscillatory critical systems ,",
    "the above structures are built of domain walls ( dws ) connecting stable states of opposite orientation of an order parameter .",
    "similar patterns and bubbles are observed in excitable ( reaction - diffusion ) chemical systems below the critical ( bifurcation ) point @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that difficulties of early magnetic and dipolar bubble technologies reviewed in @xcite can , nowadays , be overcome thanks to the advance of miniaturization .",
    "one observes increased interest in studies of dw complexes with relevance to data storage and processing devices which are based on ferromagnetic and ferroelectric nanoelements . in particular , nanowire structures are under intense investigation because of the possibility of the most dense information packing @xcite .",
    "the importance of critical effects in nanosystems grows with decreasing in their diameters because of a significant decrease of the critical ( neel ) temperature @xcite .",
    "generic critical properties of the magnetic and electric media are described with the time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation which enables qualitative analysis of dw behaviors in all bistable systems .",
    "the dw solutions to the 1d ginzburg - landau equation are of ising ( named neel dws also ) or bloch type . under external stimulation the dws move and their collision properties determine morphology of resulting pattern structures . in the present paper , external - field - induced dw collisions in 1d ginzburg - landau systems are studied with reference to bubble formation .",
    "i show similarities of the process to the bubble formation in ferromagnetic ( or ferroelectric ) wire far from the criticality ( a system described with the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ) , referring to my previous study of the problem @xcite as i throughout the text @xcite .",
    "the creation of bubbles and dw patterns is described with connection to the property of elastic reflection of dws observed in excitable media .",
    "however , i emphasize that the present study is not related to widely investigated pulses in monostable regimes of excitable systems @xcite .    in sections ii and iii ,",
    "the field - induced collisions of dws and phase - fronts , respectively , are studied . in section iv ,",
    "the relevance of predictions on dw and front collisions to pattern formation is discussed .",
    "let us consider 1d ginzburg - landau equation for the ferromagnetic ( ferroelectric ) wire in a ( longitudinal ) external field directed along the spontaneous magnetization ( polarization ) @xmath0 here @xmath1 denotes a complex order parameter ( a two - component magnetization or polarization ) , @xmath2 determines the distance from the criticality ( @xmath3 at the phase - transition point ) , @xmath4 denotes an external ( magnetic or electric ) field intensity ( it can take positive or negative real values ) . basing on arguments related to the time - reversal symmetry ,",
    "i show that the described with ( [ gl ] ) dws have to reflect upon their collision in the parameter region where they form magnetic bubbles . under the assumption @xmath5",
    ", the domains of the stable phase of the system correspond to @xmath6 , and the single - dw solutions to ( [ gl ] ) take the form @xmath7 where    @xmath8    and @xmath9    these equations describe the bloch dw and the ising dw , respectively . only in the limiting case @xmath10 , the above solution is strict while , for @xmath11 , it neglects a small field - induced deformation of the dw profile ( an space asymmetry arising with respect to the dw center ; details are given in appendix a ) .",
    "the dws move under the condition @xmath11 in the direction dependent on the sign of @xmath12 .",
    "it is seen from ( [ dw]),([blochdw ] ) that the bloch dws can exist only in the regime @xmath13 ; therefore , at @xmath14 , the bloch dws transform into the ising dws which are the only known stationary front solutions in the regime @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "stationary two - dw solutions to ( [ gl ] ) are given in @xcite .",
    "in absence of the external field @xmath10 , the double - wall solutions describe localized static bubbles built of pairs of different type ( ising and bloch ) dws .",
    "the size of the bubble can be changed by the application of a field @xmath11 because of inducing the motion of its fronts ( dws ) and , eventually , their collisions . the collision result ( dw reflection or annihilation ) determines final spatial structure created by dws , similar to whose of 1d ferromagnets far from the critical regime ( i ) . in the present work ,",
    "i omit the discussion of the formation of bubbles built of two bloch dws or two ising dws mentioning previous studies of refs @xcite .",
    "such objects are unstable for @xmath10 ( initially stationary dws repeal or attract each other ) , thus , they are less important for potential applications than ising - bloch bubbles ( although , the stability of the ising - bloch bubbles against temporal external perturbations is a separate question discussed in @xcite ) .    obviously , eq . ( [ gl ] ) is not time - reversal invariant , while the reversibility of a dynamical system is a crucial property in terms of the stability of any localized structure ( e.g. a bubble ) @xcite . due to this irreversibility , solitary - wave solutions to ( [ gl ] )",
    "are , in the general case , relevant only to the limit of large positive values of time ( @xmath16 ) , while they are irrelevant to the opposite limit ( @xmath17 ) , in particular , because of infinite growth of the energy with @xmath17 which is indicated by nonzero values of the dissipative function ( i ) . with relevance to studying the dw collisions , and",
    "thus to investigating the stability of dw complexes , i analyze the dynamics of the bubble in the limit of large negative values of time ( in this limit , the colliding dws are noninteracting objects ) , modifying the evolution equation ( [ gl ] ) by reversing the arrow of time .",
    "the inverse - evolution equation takes the form @xmath18 let me mention an analogy to the necessity of doubling the number of degrees of freedom when formulating the dynamics of dissipative ( classical or quantum ) systems within formalisms relevant to the whole length of the time axis @xcite , ( see also i ) , in particular , the dynamics of essentially dissipative ( reaction - diffusion ) systems whose excitations are overdamped @xcite . applying the hirota s bilinearization method , following the substitutions @xmath19 , @xmath20 in ( [ gl ] ) and ( [ tilde - gl ] ) , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 take real values , one arrives at the secondary equations of motion    @xmath23    here , @xmath24 the above breaking of ( [ gl ] ) , ( [ tilde - gl ] ) into the pairs the secondary equations ( [ secondary_gla ] ) , ( [ secondary_glb ] ) , respectively , is nonunique but it leads to the equations of the lowest possible order in @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( bilinear ones ) . upon the inversion of the arrow of time ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the secondary dynamical variables transform following @xmath28 , @xmath29 while ( [ secondary_gla ] ) transform into ( [ secondary_glb ] ) and vice versa .    for @xmath30 and @xmath5 ,",
    "( the field is much weaker then the coercivity value ; thus , @xmath6 inside the domains and a deformation of the dws induced by @xmath4 is negligible ) , following appendix a , i find a two - dw ( bubble ) solutions in the form    @xmath31    where @xmath32 in the limit @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and both the fields @xmath1 and @xmath36 coincide with the static bubble solution to ( [ gl ] ) written in @xcite .    studying the dw collision ,",
    "i analyze the limit @xmath16 of the double dw solutions to ( [ gl ] ) , the formula ( [ doubledw_ia ] ) , and the @xmath17 limit of the solution to ( [ tilde - gl ] ) , the formula ( [ doubledw_ib ] ) , in the closest vicinity of the @xmath37-th dw center , noticing that @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath40 . note that ( [ initial ] ) coincides with the ising - dw profile ( [ dw]),([isingdw ] ) for @xmath43 and with the bloch - dw profile ( [ dw]),([blochdw ] ) for @xmath44 . in order to establish the magnetization dynamics in the limit of large negative values of time , i invert the motion of @xmath45 utilizing the property @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , and find @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath40 . comparing ( [ initial ] ) and ( [ final ] ) , one sees that the result of the collision is a change of the sign of the real part of @xmath50 .",
    "thus , one can think of the colliding dws that they pass through each other with constant velocity and change their character from the head - to - head into the tail - to - tail structure and vice versa .",
    "in fact , the result of the dw collision is their elastic reflection accompanied by change of the bloch dw into neel dw and vice versa , similarly to the result of field - driven or spontaneous collision of magnetic dws of the 1d landau - lifshitz equation ( i ) .",
    "let me emphasize that taking the @xmath17 limit of @xmath51 at @xmath52 leads to @xmath1 differing from ( [ final ] ) by the sign of its imaginary part , which confirms the irrelevance of ( [ gl ] ) in this limit .",
    "above , i analyzed an infinite 1d medium .",
    "finite length of the domains leads to additional consequences of the dw collision because of the natural tendency of finite systems toward energy minimization ( the energy can not be defined for infinite systems ) .",
    "the preferred direction of the dw motion before the collision ( the growth or decrease of the bubbles ) corresponds to the decrease of the zeeman energy while the collision - induced motion in the reversed direction finishes when the decrease of the interaction energy of the ( repulsing ) dws equals the zeeman - energy increase .",
    "thus , i predict the appearance of localized bubbles due to an external - field application in the parameter range @xmath13 .",
    "their diameter is determined by the strength of the driving field .",
    "approaching the bloch - ising transition point with @xmath2 results in a decrease of @xmath53 , ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "then , the imaginary parts of @xmath1 , @xmath55 decrease and , eventually , vanish at @xmath56 . simultaneously , the centers of both the dws move away from each other due to the shift of the parameters ( [ doubledw_ii ] ) of ( [ doubledw_ia ] ) and ( [ doubledw_ib ] ) , ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "the shifts of the dw centers are equal to @xmath60 .",
    "finally , at @xmath56 , ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) the centers of both the dws diverge .",
    "a domain pattern is expected to appear due to finite density of the mutually interacting bubbles .",
    "further decrease of @xmath2 ( down to @xmath63 ) results in divergence of the widths of the ( ising ) dws and , thus , in the divergence of the length of the dw interaction .",
    "an adiabatic approaching with @xmath64 is impossible in practice due to the instant widening of the dw . because of the rapid increase of the overlap of dws , one anticipates the appearance of domains of an unstable phase in our bistable medium in the regime @xmath15 ( above the bloch - ising transition and below the bifurcation point )",
    "then , an energy excess is being removed from the system via the propagation of fronts connecting domains of a stable phase with domains of an unstable phase ( e.g. fronts between ferromagnetic and paramagnetic domains ) .",
    "they always propagate into unstable state and below i call them phase fronts @xcite .",
    "we can gain insight into the pattern formation near the criticality by considering the collision of fronts propagating into unstable states .",
    "let us study front solutions to ( [ gl ] ) assuming @xmath65 or , alternatively , to a simplified version of ( [ gl ] ) , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , ( the real solutions to both the equations are the same ) . equation ( [ simplified - gl ] ) is relevant to the closest vicinity of the critical point @xmath68 , where the order parameter takes real values .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath69 vanishes when crossing the bloch - ising transition point @xmath56 ; thus , real solutions are expected to qualitatively describe the phase - front motion for the parameter range @xmath15 . since @xmath70 with @xmath71 ,",
    "i introduce a renormalized field @xmath72 in order to determine dynamical properties of the phase fronts in the vicinity of the critical point . substituting @xmath73 by @xmath74 ,",
    "one arrives at a trilinear ( hirota ) form of ( [ simplified - gl ] ) ; @xmath75 & & \\nonumber\\\\ + g\\left[(-jd_{x}^{2}+\\theta)f\\cdot f-\\mu\\theta g^{2}\\right]&=&0 .",

    "i mention that these authors have considered a generalization of ( [ simplified - gl ] ) exchanging @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 into complex coefficients ( and allowing complex @xmath1 ) , however , the real parts of these coefficients were found to determine generic dynamical properties of the phase fronts whereas the imaginary parts are responsible mainly for additional periodic structure of the phase domains @xcite , ( 1d spiral waves @xcite ) .",
    "the solution ( [ nozaki - bekki ] ) describes a collision of the phase fronts at the borders of oppositely - oriented domains of the stable phase . upon the collision both the fronts",
    "create the so called nozaki - bekki hole , a localized object which is similar to the ising dw .    for @xmath10 , following the derivation in appendix b , we find an approximate double - front solution to ( [ simplified - gl - ii ] ) of the form @xmath82 it describes two phase fronts at the borders of similarly - oriented domains of the stable phase since , contrary to the nozaki - bekki hole , all terms of @xmath83 are of the same sign .",
    "they counterpropagate into an unstable area . according to ( [ front_ii ] ) , since @xmath84 ,",
    "these fronts annihilate upon the collision . above",
    "i have neglected the external field because it introduces a big complexity to the solution ( appendix b ) . however , the asymmetry of the ginzburg - landau function due to @xmath11 plays a role in the collision - induced formation of a dissipative structure since it determines the choice of the preferred stable state @xcite , [ though , the strength of the field is limited by the condition @xmath85 ensuring that two stable homogeneous solutions to ( [ simplified - gl ] ) are of the opposite signs ] .",
    "( 175,29 ) ( 0,-3 )",
    "direct observation of the front motion in ferromagnetic and ferroelectric media is difficult because relevant time scales are very narrow .",
    "thus , i refer to an experiment on a ( bistable ) ferrocyanide - iodate - sulfite chemical reaction performed in a continuous - flow stirred tank reactor @xcite .",
    "when the ferrocyanide concentration is decreased , the morphology of the 2d chemical structure changes . at a relatively - low concentration , irregular stationary patterns of dws ( lamellae ) appear and change into bubble structures with a further concentration decrease .",
    "the lamellae formation is accompanied by the property of the dw reflection upon their externally - driven collision ( which is enforced by an intense irradiation ) .",
    "on increasing the critical parameter ( the ferrocyanide concentration ) , the lamellae dissapear while domains become inhomogeneous ( spiral structure of the domains appears ) and their fronts annihilate upon the collision .",
    "i identify the transition between structures analogous to visualized in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) with the decrease of the critical parameter @xmath2 , and the transition between structures in figs .",
    "1(b ) and 1(c ) with crossing the bloch - ising point @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the predicted dynamical behavior of dws of a generic ( ginzburg - landau ) model of bistable systems coincides with that observed in a chemical reaction below the critical point .",
    "further increase of the ferrocyanide concentration leads to the appearance of wave - front reflection and self - replication of phase spots .",
    "these effects are related to differences in the diffusion coefficients of the chemical species ; therefore , they can not be predicted within the ginzburg - landau model . according to calculations using a two - species ( gray - scott ) model of a chemical reaction",
    ", the self - replication regime relates to the monostability of the system @xcite .",
    "i conclude that the coexistence of subcritical effects of front reflection and annihilation ( accompanied by the creation of dissipative structures ) can be explained by the appearance of domains of the unstable phase above the bloch - ising transition point .",
