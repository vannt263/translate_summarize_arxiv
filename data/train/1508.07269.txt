    "recent advances in wireless communications and microelectronic devices are leading the trend of research toward cognitive radios ( crs ) @xcite .",
    "the main feature of crs is the opportunistic usage of spectrum .",
    "cr systems try to improve the spectrum efficiency by using the spectrum holes in frequency , time , and space domains @xcite .",
    "this means that secondary users ( sus ) are allowed to utilize the spectrum , provided that their transmissions do not interfere with the communication of primary users ( pus ) @xcite .",
    "the fundamental components of cr systems that allow them to avoid interference are spectrum sensing and resource allocation .",
    "however , in a practical cr network , spectrum occupancy measurements for all the frequency channels at all times are not available .",
    "this is partially because of energy limitations and network failures .",
    "another highly important and very common reason for occurrence of missing entries in the data set is the hardware limitation .",
    "each su may want to use different frequency channels , but it may not be capable of sensing all the channels simultaneously @xcite . on the other hand , a complete and reliable spectrum sensing data set is needed for a reliable resource allocation .",
    "therefore , we need to develop a method to estimate the missing spectrum sensing measurements . this task is especially more challenging in dynamic environments .",
    "there are different approaches toward the problem of data analysis in the cr networks . in @xcite ,",
    "a learning approach is introduced based on support vector machine ( svm ) for spectrum sensing in multi - antenna cognitive radios .",
    "svm classification techniques are applied to detect the presence of pus .",
    "several algorithms have been been proposed using dictionary learning framework @xcite .",
    "these approaches try to find the principal components of data using dictionary learning and exploit the components to extract information .",
    "the goal of this paper is to estimate the missing spectrum sensing data as accurate as possible in the time varying environments .",
    "an approach is introduced based on nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf ) @xcite to represent the spectrum measurements as additive , not subtractive , combination of several components .",
    "each component reflects signature of one pu , therefore the data can be factorized as the product of signatures matrix times an activation matrix .",
    "dimension reduction is an inevitable pre - processing step for high dimensional data analysis @xcite .",
    "nmf is a dimension reduction technique that has been employed in diverse fields @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of nmf , which makes it distinguished from other component analysis methods , is the non - negativity constraint .",
    "thus the original data can be represented as additive combination of its parts .    in our proposed method ,",
    "a new framework is introduced to decompose the spectrum measurements in cr networks using a piecewise constant nmf algorithm in presence of missing data .",
    "piecewise constant nmf and its application in video structuring is introduced in @xcite . in the proposed method",
    ", we try to handle the missing entries in the data and also take a different approach to solve the corresponding optimization problem using an iterative reweighed technique .    in the context of cr networks",
    ", nmf is utilized in @xcite to estimate the power spectra of the sources in a cr network by factorizing the fourier transform of the correlation matrix of the received signals .",
    "our proposed method estimates the missing entries in power spectral density measurements by enforcing a temporal structure on the activity of the pus and can be used in scenarios when the number of the pus is not known .",
    "the introduced method takes advantage of a prior information about the activity of the pus and exploits piecewise constant constraint to improve the performance of the factorization .",
    "moreover , a solution for the introduced minimization problem is suggested using the majorization - minimization ( mm ) framework .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following order . in section  [ model ] , the system model and the problem statement are introduced .",
    "section  [ pcnmf ] describes the proposed new nmf problem . in section  [ mm ]",
    ", a method is presented to solve the piecewise constant nmf problem in mm framework with missing data .",
    "section  [ results ] presents the simulation results and finally section  [ conclusions ] draws conclusions .",
    "due to the nature of wireless environments , trustworthy information can not be extracted from measurements of a single su . to find the spectrum holes in frequency , time , and space , there exists a fusion center that collects and combines the measurements from all the sus @xcite .",
    "cooperative spectrum sensing makes the missing data estimation algorithm more robust .",
    "fusion center predicts the missing entries by using the collected measurements.however , since each su is not able to sense the whole spectrum all the time , the data set collected from the sus contains missing entries .",
    "network failures , energy limitations , and shadowing can also cause loss of data .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we want to reconstruct the power map in a single frequency band .",
    "the network consists of @xmath0 primary transmitters and @xmath1 spectrum sensors that are randomly spread over the entire area of interest .",
    "figure  [ powermap ] illustrates an example of a network with @xmath2 pus and @xmath3 sus in a @xmath4 area .",
    "the received power of the @xmath5 sensor at time @xmath6 can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the transmit - power of the @xmath9 pu at time @xmath6 , @xmath10 is the channel gain from the @xmath9 pu to the @xmath5 su , and @xmath11 is the zero - mean gaussian measurement noise at the @xmath5 sensor with variance @xmath12 . considering a rayleigh fading model ,",
    "the channel gain coefficient can be modeled as : @xmath13 where the channel constant @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the carrier frequency , @xmath16 is the speed of light , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the transmitter and receiver antenna gains .",
    "@xmath19 is the path loss exponent which determines the rate at which power decays with the separation distance @xmath20 between the @xmath5 su and the @xmath9 pu and @xmath21 models the fading effect .    at time",
    "slot @xmath6 , measurements from sus can be stacked in a vector @xmath22 , given as @xmath23 where @xmath24^t}$ ] , @xmath25^t}$ ] , and @xmath26^t}$ ] . at each time slot ,",
    "only a few sus observe the power levels and report them to the fusion center .",
    "therefore the vector @xmath22 contains some _ missing _ entries .",
    "furthermore , each pu can be active or inactive in each time slot .",
    "some of the characteristics of the environment can be exploited to simplify the problem .",
    "it is assumed that channel gains are slowly time varying such that they can be considered as constant in a time window .",
    "therefore , matrix representation of ( [ multiple_su ] ) can be written as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an @xmath29 matrix , which includes measurements from sensors in @xmath30 time slots , @xmath31 $ ] is a @xmath32 matrix , which consists of @xmath0 channel gain vectors in the @xmath1-dimensional space of data , and @xmath33 is an @xmath34 matrix that indicates the power levels of pus in each time slot ( @xmath35 if the @xmath9 pu is inactive at time @xmath6 ) .    here , the goal is to estimate the missing data using the partial observations . to achieve this goal ,",
    "the data is decomposed using piecewise constant nmf .",
    "then the components of data and the activation matrix are used to estimate the missing data .",
    "promoted by ( [ compact_form ] ) , it is easy to see that the measurements of each time slot can be represented as an additive , not subtractive , combination of few vectors .",
    "this algebraic representation has a geometric interpretation .",
    "figure  [ pyramid ] helps us to visualize the structure of data in a @xmath36-dimensional space of data . in this figure",
    ", @xmath36 sus are measuring power levels in an area with @xmath36 pus .",
    "it is easy to notice that measurement vectors lie within a pyramid in the positive orthant with @xmath37 edges proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to fact that all the points in the pyramid can be written as an additive combination of the edges .",
    "although it is assumed that the channel gains are stationary for a time window of length @xmath30 , pus can become activated / deactivated in this time window any number of times and can change their transmission power in each activation .",
    "hence , the power levels of pus tend to be piecewise constant .",
    "nmf is a widely - used technique to decompose data to its nonnegative components . here",
    ", the structure of the power level matrix @xmath33 is exploited while handling the missing entries . as a result ,",
    "the general objective function is presented as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a weighted measure of fit and @xmath41 is a penalty , which favors piecewise constant solutions .",
    "@xmath42 is a nonnegative scalar weighting the penalty .",
    "the constraints denote that all the entries of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are nonnegative .",
    "@xmath45 is an @xmath29 weight matrix that is used to estimate the weighted distance between @xmath28 and @xmath46 .",
    "the coefficients of the weight matrix denote the presence of data ( @xmath47 if the measurement of the @xmath5 su at time slot @xmath6 is unavailable / available ) .",
    "nmf algorithms utilize different measures of fit such as euclidean distance , generalized kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence , and the itakura - saito divergence . in all the cases ,",
    "the distance can be calculated as the sum of the distances between different coefficients @xcite .",
    "@xmath48    in our case , euclidean distance is used as the measure of fit .",
    "this objective function is commonly used for problems with gaussian noise model , a common noise model in communication systems , hence : @xmath49    since there exist sharp transitions in power level of pus and power level of each pu is constant in each transmission period , rows of @xmath50 tend to be piecewise constant . in order to favor the piecewise constant solutions ,",
    "the penalty function is defined as : @xmath51    when @xmath52 tends to @xmath53 , this penalty function represents the sum of @xmath54 norm of the transition vectors , i.e. @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is an @xmath57 vector containing power levels of pus in time @xmath6 .",
    "this penalty favors the solutions with a lower number of transitions .",
    "however , since it is not differentiable , it can be replaced with a differentiable approximation : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a small positive constant and is much less than all the non - zero elements of @xmath60 @xmath61 to avoid division by zero .    in section [ mm ] , an algorithm is derived to find the minimizer of the following problem : @xmath62    after estimating @xmath33 and @xmath43 , the missing entries of @xmath28 can be approximated using the equation @xmath63 .",
    "in this section , an iterative algorithm is described to find the solution of the optimization problem proposed in ( [ scale_objective ] ) .",
    "for that , majorization - minimization ( mm ) framework is employed @xcite .",
    "mm algorithm and its variants have been used in various applications such as parameter learning and image processing @xcite .",
    "the update rules are derived to calculate the entries of @xmath33 given the entries of @xmath43 and then the entries of @xmath43 given the entries of @xmath33 , using an iterative reweighed algorithm .",
    "first , the update rules for @xmath33 given @xmath43 are derived .",
    "then , the update rules for @xmath43 will be derived in a similar manner .    as it is clear in ( [ seperable_measure ] ) , we can write the distance measure as a sum of different time slots : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the weighted euclidean distance between @xmath66 and @xmath67 , given @xmath66 and @xmath43 . in mm framework , the update rules are derived by minimizing an auxiliary function @xcite . by definition",
    ", @xmath68 is an auxiliary function of @xmath65 if and only if @xmath69 and @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath68 is chosen such that it is easier to minimize , the optimization of @xmath65 can be replaced with iterative minimization of @xmath68 over @xmath72 .",
    "thus , in the literature , convex functions are frequently used as the auxiliary functions @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that @xmath65 is non - increasing under the update @xmath73    this is due to the fact that in the @xmath74 iteration we have @xmath75 .    following a similar approach as @xcite ,",
    "the auxiliary function for the weighted euclidean distance can be formulated as : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is an @xmath78 diagonal matrix with @xmath79 and @xmath80 is the @xmath9 diagonal entry of @xmath81 and @xmath82 is element - wise multiplication .    to solve the problem presented in ( [ scale_objective ] )",
    ", the contribution of @xmath83 should be considered in the auxiliary function .",
    "for that , a convex version of @xmath83 is employed : @xmath84 now the update rules can be obtained using the iterative version of ( [ reweighted_penalty ] ) .",
    "this means that @xmath85 is updated in each iteration using the values of @xmath33 in the previous iteration .    to form the penalized auxiliary function , @xmath86 , we add up @xmath87 with the contribution of @xmath72 to @xmath41 .",
    "thus , @xmath86 can be written as : @xmath88.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    it is worthwhile to mention that @xmath89 @xmath90 . since @xmath86 is convex , it can be easily minimized over @xmath72 by setting the gradient to zero .",
    "hence the update rule is attained as : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the @xmath9 element of the gradient @xmath93 .    finding the update rule for @xmath43 is simple .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath41 is not a function of @xmath43 .",
    "hence , the update rule for @xmath43 is similar to the update rule for standard nmf , except the missing entries must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the update rules can be written in matrix form as : @xmath94 where @xmath82 is the element - wise multiplication and the division is also performed in an element - wise manner .",
    "the obtained update rules in ( [ p_update_rule ] ) and ( [ gamma_update_rule ] ) are exploited alternatively to estimate @xmath43 and @xmath33 . then the missing entries of @xmath28 are predicted by @xmath95 .",
    "however , by using the objective function in ( [ scale_objective ] ) , the optimization problem results in solutions with entries of @xmath33 tend toward @xmath53 and @xmath96 tends toward @xmath97 .",
    "we take advantage of the scale ambiguity between @xmath43 and @xmath33 to avoid this issue .",
    "let @xmath98 be a diagonal @xmath78 matrix with its @xmath9 diagonal entry equal to @xmath99 . in each iteration",
    ", the rescaled matrix pair @xmath100 is used instead of the original matrix pair @xmath101 .    as a practical scenario",
    ", we should also consider the case when the secondary network has no information about the number of the pus , i.e. @xmath0 . in this case , the common dimension of matrices @xmath43 and @xmath33 is not known .",
    "there have been some efforts in model order selection in nmf @xcite . in the numerical experiments ,",
    "@xmath102 is used as the common dimension to factorize the data in such conditions .",
    "this is only possible if the secondary network has some information about the upper bound of @xmath0 .",
    "for the numerical experiments , one frequency channel is considered with @xmath103 active pus in the area .",
    "figure [ topol ] illustrates the topology of the network .",
    "incomplete measurements are collected from @xmath104 sus .",
    "we use the same simulation environment and the same network topology as in @xcite .",
    "the simulation parameters are set as follows , unless otherwise is stated .",
    "the path loss is computed as @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the distance , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "@xmath10 is computed by multiplying the pathloss by the fading coefficient @xmath109 where    @xmath110    @xmath111 , and @xmath112 is circulary symmetric zero mean complex gaussian noise with variance @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "pus activity is modeled by a first order markov model .",
    "all the pus utilize the spectrum @xmath114 of the time slots .",
    "transition matrix of the @xmath9 pu is @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath117 is the probability that the @xmath9 pu stops transmitting from time @xmath118 to @xmath6 and @xmath119 is the probability that the pu activates transmitting .",
    "the parameter @xmath117 is uniformly distributed over @xmath120 $ ] .    each time a pu becomes activated , it chooses the transmission power from a uniform distribution with support @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "each su makes a measurement with @xmath122 of chance .",
    "the measurements are contaminated by additive white gaussian noise .",
    "the noise variance is @xmath123 for all the sus .",
    "partial measurements are generated for @xmath124 time slots .",
    "to reduce the computational burden , the first @xmath125 time slots are used to estimate @xmath43 .",
    "next , by using the obtained @xmath43 and the update rule ( [ p_update_rule ] ) , @xmath33 is estimated for all @xmath126 time slots .",
    "the regularization factor @xmath42 is set to @xmath127 and @xmath128 factors are used to factorize the data .    figure [ truevspredicted ] shows the true power levels and the reconstructed one at a randomly selected su versus time for the time window of @xmath129 samples .",
    "it can be seen that the missing entries are accurately recovered through the proposed method , and it is evident that the proposed algorithm can easily track abrupt changes in power level .",

    "the batch version of ss - dl is employed and the parameters are set to their optimal values .",
    "furthermore , to emphasize the effect of the piecewise constant penalty , the results are also compared with the weighted nmf , i.e. wnmf @xcite .",

    "this figure illustrates the fact that the proposed method produces a more accurate factorization by taking advantage of piecewise constant constraint as a prior information .",
    "as it was expected , power levels estimated by pc - nmf are piecewise constant , while the results generated by wnmf are noisy .",
    "in fact , the piecewise constant penalty decreases the effect of noise and fading .",
