    "the couplings are mainly repulsive and then only the numerous chain structures without contact are relevant .",

    "the equilibrium probability of occurrence of the native structure equals 1/2 at @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , it may be seen on the example of fig.[ftot ] , that , for @xmath67 , the temperatures of transition are @xmath68 and @xmath69 and the effective hamiltonian of the native structure for these temperatures are @xmath70 and @xmath71 leading to @xmath72 as , @xmath73 } { z(t_c ) }   =    \\frac{\\exp[-{\\cal h}_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm nat}(t_w)/t_w ] } { z(t_w)}\\ ] ] one deduces the equality of the partition functions , @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the probability of occurrence of each extended structure , having a zero effective hamiltonian , is simply one over the partition function and is the same at @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "rationally , to satisfy to the equality of the partition functions , one supposes that the conformational effective hamiltonians satisfy to @xmath75 whatever the structure @xmath6 .",
    "the configurational spaces where the effective hamiltonians are roughly linearly scaled by the temperatures may thus be expected for these temperatures .",
    "this result holds whatever the solvent quality . to be more precise ,",
    "the equilibrium probabilities of each structure remains almost constant at the temperatures of denaturation when the solvent quality is varied . as a consequence ,",
    "the transition rates between two conformations @xmath6 and @xmath76 , @xmath77 $ ] , are almost constant at the denaturations temperatures for all @xmath78 , leading to this ( quasi ) equality of the folding times at @xmath1 and @xmath0    for @xmath79 , the temperature of cold denaturation tends toward 0 .",
    "the conformational landscape still exhibits a well pronounced effective hamiltonian minimum for the native structure , but as the temperature becomes very small the transition rates becomes either quasi null or huge .",
    "it takes huge amount of time to overcome some local energetic barriers .",
    "thus the folding time tends to infinity at @xmath1 because the kinetics is then frozen .",
    "then , folding time at @xmath1 increases rapidly as @xmath4 decreases from -6.4 to -7.0 .",
    "0.3 cm    for each value of @xmath4 , the folding time goes through a maximum value at a temperature noted @xmath80 .",
    "the region of the curves where @xmath81 , simply confirms that the time needed for a random conformation to reach the native structure increases as the temperature is decreased . however , the behavior of the curves for @xmath82 is less usual .",
    "it corresponds to an increasing of the speed of the kinetics with respect to a decrease of the temperature .",
    "this result is not in accordance with standard monte carlo simulations and its explanation is given below .",

    "main : free energy of the native ( square ) , the trap ( filled circle ) conformations and the transition state ( + ) versus temperature for @xmath84 .",
    "the arrows show some free energy barriers @xmath85 .",
    ", width=288 ]    it is observed that the trap do not depend on the temperature .",
    "the trap present a great similarity with the native structure .",
    "six contacts among the nine contacts of nat are observed in trap .",
    "thus , its effective hamiltonian is very close from that of nat showing that this structure could be a good candidate for the trap of the system .",
    "second , there is no physical pathway from trap to nat keeping unbroken the whole set of contacts .",
    "that is to say , in a typical trajectory from the trap to nat , each contact of the trap has to be broken and some of them created again in an other global arrangement . obviously , they are not simultaneously broken .",
    "if it were the case , the trajectories would contain some extended structures without contacts which would have a very great difference of effective hamiltonian with the trap .",
    "consequently , even step by step , the transition rate for such sub - pathway would be quasi - null .",
    "thus , in more favorable pathways , some contacts are broken while some others are created and the chain walks through local rearrangements toward nat without reaching any extended conformation .",
    "a particular structure of the sequence is the transition state .",
    "it is determined by performing a new simulation of 1000 trajectories where the trap is always the first conformation . for each trajectory ,",
    "the conformation of highest value of the effective hamiltonian is considered as a possible transition state .",
    "the transition state ( ts ) is the structure with the lowest value of effective hamiltonian among the sampling of possible transition states collected over the 1000 trajectories ( see inset of fig.[ftot ] ) . among all the possible pathways from trap to nat , those passing through ts are the less energetically costly .",
    "one must note that this is not the usual definition of the transition state adopted in the theory of protein folding where the ts is not a unique structure but an ensemble of configurations of highest free energy along the path or paths between unfolded macrostates and the native structure @xcite .",
    "here , the defintion of the ts is that used in the theory of the simple gaz chemical reactions .",
    "moreover , as explained above , it can be seen that ts has a weak similarity with nat or with the trap .",
    "the key role of the trap in the folding process is explained as follow .",
    "some trajectories , starting by a random conformations , fall in the trap valley . to leave this structure the chain has to overcome the largest barrier of the system . on the other hand , the trajectories which do not reach the trap valley ,",
    "walk down the native structure , passing quickly over smaller barriers .",
    "thus , only the trap activation barrier is considered in the folding analysis .    for @xmath86 , the values of the effective hamiltonian for nat , the trap and",
    "ts are reported on fig.[ftot ] .",
    "the activation barrier between the trap and nat structures , @xmath87 , shown on fig.[ftot ] , obviously depends on the temperature . for @xmath88",
    ", @xmath89 is almost constant whereas it decreases very quickly with the temperature for @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the kinetic theory indicates that the time needed to escape from the trap valley is in proportion to @xmath91 .",
    "figure [ arrh ] showed the very sharp decreasing of @xmath92 with respect to a decrease of the temperature for @xmath93 .",
    "one must noted the quasi equality of this last quantity at the temperatures of denaturation .",
    "0.8 cm     logarithm of the folding time ( filled square ) and @xmath94 ( filled circle ) versus the temperature for @xmath84 . ,",

    ", the folding time is in proportion to @xmath100 , this result permits to elucidate why the lower the temperature , the faster is the kinetics at low temperature and the higher the temperature , the faster also is the kinetics at high temperature .",

    "the difference of effective hamiltonian between two conformations decreases faster than the temperature .",
