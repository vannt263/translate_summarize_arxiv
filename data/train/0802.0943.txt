    "early generations of stars affect the subsequent evolution of the universe in diverse ways , such as the cosmic reionization and metal - enrichment of the intergalactic medium .",
    "in contrast to a number of theoretical attempts to understand their nature in the last decade ( e.g. , bromm & larson 2004 ; ciardi & ferrara 2005 ) , their observational confirmations are thus far extremely limited . among them , surveys of metal - poor stars in the galactic halo provide unique tools to catch a glimpse of star formation in very low - metallicity environments in early galaxies ( e.g. , beers & christlieb 2005 ) .    in recent years",
    ", hundreds of extremely metal - poor ( emp ) stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath6 ) have been found in the halo .",
    "a high fraction of them is noticeably enhanced with surface carbon abundance .",
    "such carbon - enhanced extremely metal - poor ( cemp ) stars have attracted particular attention in constraining the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in metal - poor environments . especially , those with @xmath7-process element enhancement , cemp-@xmath7 stars , are considered to originate from secondary stars in binary systems .",
    "they acquired the surface carbon during the agb phase of intermediate - mass ( several @xmath8 ) primary stars through the binary - mass transfer .",
    "although such carbon enhanced stars are present among population i stars as well ( about 1 % ) , the cemp-@xmath7 stars make up far higher fraction ( about 20 % ) of the emp stars ( e.g. , lucatello et al . 2005 ) .",
    "since such a high fraction can not be accounted for under the same imf as in the solar vicinity , lucatello et al .",
    "( 2005 ) concluded that the imf is biased toward higher mass in the early galaxy . by using more sophisticated stellar evolution models , komiya et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reached similar conclusion .",
    "although there is apparent scarcity of stars in the ultra - metal poor ( ump ) range ( @xmath9[fe / h]@xmath10 ) thus far ( e.g. , salvadori et al .",
    "2007 ) , three stars has been discovered with [ fe / h]@xmath11 and all of them are carbon - enhanced ( christlieb et al . 2002 ; frebel et al . 2005 ; norris et al .",
    "suda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that their carbon enhancement can be explained by the binary - transfer hypothesis similar to that for the cemp stars . extending",
    "the above argument to lower metallicity range , tumlinson ( 2007 ) concluded that the imf is even more skewed toward massive ones .",
    "it is quite natural to conceive that this trend persists also in the ump range .",
    "moreover , the current lacking of ump stars might suggest that even less low - mass stars are formed in this range .",
    "is there any possible mechanism that favors the formation of intermediate - mass stars in these metallicity ranges ? in metal - free gas ,",
    "the first stars are expected to be very massive , more than @xmath12 , owing to inefficient fragmentation of dense cores whose mass scale is @xmath13 formed at @xmath14 ( bromm , coppi , & larson 1999 ) . on the other hand , a slight amount of dust",
    "enables fragmentation at higher densities and then low - mass ( @xmath15 ) core formation owing to the cooling by dust thermal emission ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 , 2006 ; omukai et al . 2005 ; tsuribe & omukai 2006 ( paper i ) ) . in this case , although the upper limit of stellar mass is not known , there is no particular reason favoring the formation of intermediate - mass stars .    here",
    ", we propose a physical mechanism that prohibits low - mass star formation in the metallicity range @xmath16}_{0 } \\la -4 $ ] despite being above the critical metallicity @xmath17}_{\\rm cr}$ ] for dust - induced fragmentation.}_{0 } \\equiv { \\rm log}(z / z_{\\sun})$ ] .",
    "] this allows transition from intermediate - mass to low - mass star formation mode around the ump to emp range provided that a significant fraction of metals are already locked into dust by the time metallicity reaches this value .",
    "fragmentation properties of star - forming cores are largely determined by their thermal evolution . in figure 1",
    ", we show the temperature per unit hydrogen nuclei @xmath18 @xmath19 for metallicities @xmath17_{0}}=-5.5 , -4.5 $ ] , and -3.5 ( solid lines ) .",
    "also those with @xmath20_{0 } } \\le -3.8 $ ] are shown by dotted lines with an increment of 0.1 .",
    "these are calculated using a one - zone model as in omukai et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , except for the dust model , for which we use that produced in the pair - instability supernova of a metal - free @xmath21 star ( schneider et al .",
    "dust from type ii sn gives a similar result ( see schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the case of metallicity",
    "[ m / h]@xmath22 -4.5 , a sudden jump in @xmath18 is present around @xmath23 , which is caused by heat injection due to three - body h@xmath2 formation ( palla , salpeter , & stahler 1983 ) . this temperature jump is observed only in the range @xmath24_{0 } } \\la -4.0 $ ] ( see dotted lines ) . for lower metallicities ( e.g. , [ m / h]@xmath25 ) , the temperature is already high at the density where the three - body reaction begins and the consequence of heat injection is just a gradual increase in temperature . on the other hand , for higher metallicities ( e.g. , [ m / h]@xmath26 ) ,",
    "h@xmath2 formation is almost complete , owing to dust surface reactions .",
    "thus , the three - body reaction plays minor role and the heat injection is small . only around [ m / h]@xmath27 does heat injection by three - body reaction result in a dramatic temperature increase .",
    "we expect that when the equation of state becomes stiff owing to the h@xmath2 formation heating , a hydrostatic core forms and that it becomes spherical to a high degree .",
    "since an initial elongation of the core of @xmath28 is required for fragmentation in the dust - cooling phase ( paper i ) , this heating is expected to prevent the subsequent fragmentation . in the following section ,",
    "we demonstrate that this is indeed the case by way of hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "we study the evolution of cloud cores at high densities where the effects of the heating by three - body h@xmath2 formation and cooling by dust are important by performing hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "we use a barotropic equation of state ( eos ) in figure 1 for thermal evolution . as in paper",
    "i , we choose the self - similar solution with @xmath29 as an unperturbed initial state , to which both non - spherical density / velocity and random - velocity perturbations are added in the same manner as in paper i. the initial amplitude of elongation @xmath30 is taken to be unity , where @xmath31 is the short ( long , respectively ) core axis length . in paper",
    "i , we started calculation just before the onset of the dust cooling without rotation . here to see the effect of h@xmath2 formation heating , we start calculation at lower initial number density of @xmath32 at the center . as well as non - rotating cores , in this paper the cores with initial rigid rotation are considered .",
    "total mass of the cloud is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 depends on metallicity ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) based on the godunov - type scheme ( tsuribe & inutsuka 1999 ; inutsuka 2002 ) as in paper i , but with implementation of particle splitting by the condition that smoothing length is to be smaller than @xmath35 of the jeans length . in particle",
    "splitting , eight daughter particles are created on the vertices of a cube ( martel et al .",
    "2006 ) in high density regions .",
    "the initial number of sph particles is @xmath36 .",
    "we remark that our method meets the resolution condition for physical fragmentation ( e.g. , klein et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "the evolution of the core with metallicity @xmath17_{0}}=-4.5 $ ] is shown in figure 2 ( a1-a4 ) .",
    "the initial core has angular velocity of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the initial density at the center . as a result of the prominent h@xmath2 formation heating at @xmath39 , the pressure force exceeds gravity .",
    "the collapse is almost halted along the short axis of the core while it continues along the long axis .",
    "consequently , the elongation of the core diminishes as can be seen in figure 3 . at this time",
    ", the core becomes almost hydrostatic and the accretion shock appears on the surface ( figure 2 ( a2 ) ) .",
    "the core continues to contract owing to accretion of the ambient medium .",
    "although the core becomes elongated during the dust - cooling phase ( @xmath40 ) , for @xmath41 the eos becomes adiabatic and the growth of elongation slows down ( see figure 3 ) . during the dust - cooling phase , elongation grows at the disk formation epoch ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "however , with a small value of elongation at the onset of dust cooling , the maximum elongation reaches at most @xmath43 ( figure 2 ( a3 ) ; figure 3 ) .",
    "we calculated the cases with other values of initial angular velocity ( @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) and found that the maximum value of elongation does not exceed @xmath46 in any case .",
    "since this falls below the critical value for fragmentation @xmath47 ( paper i ) , fragmentation does not occur .",
    "we followed the evolution of the core until the early accretion stage and confirmed that it does not fragment ( see figure 2 ( a4 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the minimum fragmentation mass is set by the jeans mass before the h@xmath2 formation heating , which is @xmath48 .      here",
    "we show that both the cores with @xmath17_{0}}=-5.5 $ ] and -3.5 fragment in the dust - cooling phase .",
    "we illustrate the case of @xmath17_{0}}=-5.5 $ ] with initial angular velocity @xmath37 in figure 2 ( b1-b4 ) .",
    "for @xmath40 the temperature drops rapidly due to the dust cooling ( figure 1 ) , and the core becomes elongated to a filament ( figure 2 ( b2,b3 ) ; figure 3 ) .",
    "although the temperature evolution becomes adiabatic after the core becomes optically thick , for @xmath49 , the elongation continues to increase owing to inertia . at @xmath50 ,",
    "the elongation attains its maximum of @xmath51 , which is enough for the filament to fragment ( paper i ) . as seen in figure 2 ( b4 )",
    ", the filament fragments into five pieces and an additional five density peaks are still developing . in the non - rotating case ,",
    "the maximum elongation is @xmath52 ( figure 3 ) , and two fragments are observed along with additional five growing density peaks .",
    "that is , rotation enhances the elongation and promote the fragmentation of the cores .",
    "this is because the elongation has longer time to grow during the collapse delayed by rotation .",
    "we also calculated the case of higher metallicity @xmath17_{0}}=-3.5 $ ] , and found similar evolutionary features , although with larger maximum elongation of @xmath53 ( figure 3 ) even without rotation . the core fragmented into at least seven pieces .",
    "the dust cooling produces low - mass fragments of star - forming cores with metallicity as low as [ m / h]@xmath54 , consistent with previous studies .",
    "however , there is a pocket in the metallicity range @xmath16_{0 } } \\la -4 $ ] , where the low - mass fragmentation is prohibited by sudden heat injection due to the three - body h@xmath2 formation . in this range ,",
    "the fragmentation mass is @xmath55 .",
    "no low - mass ( @xmath56 ) core is formed , although fragmentation of this intermediate - mass core into a binary is not rejected .",
    "once the metallicity exceeds @xmath17_{0 } } \\sim -4 $ ] , low - mass star formation becomes possible by the dust cooling without hindrance by the three - body h@xmath2 formation heating .",
    "this provides a physical mechanism for the high characteristic mass ( @xmath57 several @xmath8 ; tumlison 2007 ) of low - metallicity stars , which is suspected from the observed high frequency of low - metallicity carbon - enhanced stars . in addition , the observed scarcity of ultra metal - poor stars , if confirmed , can be explained .",
    "this also means that we need to modify the simplest scenario for the transition in star formation modes in the metal - poor gas ; i.e. , below a critical metallicity @xmath17_{\\rm cr } } ( \\simeq -6 ... -5)$ ] only massive stars are formed while low - mass stars are always formed in gas with metallicities above it ( e.g. , salvadori et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we showed that h@xmath2 formation on dust grains quenches the sudden heat injection by three - body h@xmath2 formation at a metallicity [ m / h]@xmath58 and enables low - mass star formation above this metallicity .",
    "the range of metallicity @xmath24_{0 } } \\la -4.0 $ ] , where the sudden temperature jump appears , is slightly wider , but similar to the width of the observed gap in the mdf .",
    "although this coincidence is encouraging , it should not be taken at the face value since our calculation still contains uncertain parameters .",
    "in particular , the nature of dust , e.g. , gas - dust ratio , composition , and size distribution , in the early universe is very uncertain . in the early universe",
    ", the dust is assumed to be produced in supernova events and indeed a signature of dust has been observed in the extinction of high - z quasars and grbs ( maiolino et al . 2004 ; stratta et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "in the nearby universe , there is no firm evidence for the dust production in supernova remnants ( e.g. , bouchet et al .",
    "even if the dust production is efficient , a significant fraction of it might be destroyed by a reverse shock on the spot ( bianchi & schneider 2007 ; nozawa et al .",
    "in addition , the rate coefficient of three - body reaction rate is still uncertain , in particular , at low temperatures ( flower & harris 2007 ; glover 2007 ) . considering those uncertainties , we should admit that although our prediction that the heating by three - body reaction prevents low - mass fragmentation in some metallicity range somewhere around [ m / h]@xmath27 remains valid qualitatively , the exact metallicity range where this mechanism works would be altered .    finally , we discuss effects of rotation .",
    "our result shows that the rotation accelerates the growth of elongation , thereby promoting the fragmentation .",
    "this is consistent with the result by clark , glover , & klessen ( 2007 ) , who showed that , even in the primordial gas , where no fragmentation is observed without rotation , rotating cores can fragment after the formation of rotation supported disks although fragmentation is far less frequent than other cases . in our cases ,",
    "the core does not fragment in the metallicity range @xmath16}_{0 } \\la -4 $ ] even with rotation .",
    "since parameters of the initial cores are not thoroughly surveyed here , some cores might result in fragmentation in this metallicity range .",
    "even so , we expect that the number of such low - mass fragments is smaller than in other range .",
    "more studies on the effects of rotation on low - metallicity star formation are awaited .",
