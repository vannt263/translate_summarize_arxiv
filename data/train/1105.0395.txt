    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the connections between volume growth , uniqueness of bounded solutions for the heat equation , and spectral properties for infinite weighted graphs .",
    "to do so , we proceed in two steps .",
    "we first establish these connections on a class of graphs with a very weak spherical symmetry .",
    "we then give some comparison results for general graphs by using a notion of curvature .    a very general framework for studying operators on discrete measure spaces",
    "was recently established in @xcite .",
    "we use this set up throughout with the additional assumption that the underlying weighted graphs are locally finite .",
    "we first introduce the class of weakly spherically symmetric graphs which , compared with spherically symmetric graphs , can have very little symmetry .",
    "still , these graphs turn out to be accessible to a detailed analysis much as those with a full spherical symmetry .",
    "more precisely , we can characterize them by the fact that :    * their heat kernels are spherically symmetric ( theorem  [ t : hk_wsp ] in section  [ s : hk ] ) .",
    "moreover , for operators arising on these graphs we prove :    * an explicit estimate for the bottom of their spectrum and a criterion for the discreteness of the spectrum in terms of volume growth and the boundary of balls ( theorem  [ t : spectrum ] in section  [ s : spectrum ] ) . * a characterization of stochastic completeness in terms of volume growth and the boundary of balls ( theorem  [ t : stochastic ] in section  [ s : stochastic ] ) .",
    "both the estimate for the bottom of the spectrum and the condition for stochastic completeness involve the ratio of a generalized volume of a ball to its weighted boundary . in this sense ,",
    "our estimates complement the classic lower bound on the bottom of the spectrum of the ordinary graph laplacian in terms of cheeger s constant given by dodziuk in @xcite in the case of unbounded geometry .",
    "these results give rise to examples of graphs of polynomial volume growth which have positive bottom of the spectrum and are stochastically incomplete .",
    "therefore , as a surprising consequence , in the standard graph metric there are no direct analogues to the theorems of grigoryan , relating volume growth and stochastic completeness @xcite , and of brooks , relating volume growth and the bottom of the essential spectrum @xcite , from the manifold setting . for stochastic completeness this was already observed in @xcite .",
    "these examples are studied at the end of the paper , in section  [ s : application ] .",
    "we now turn to the second step of our investigation , i.e. , the comparison of general weighted graphs to weakly spherically symmetric ones . in this context , we provide :    * heat kernel comparisons ( theorem  [ t : hk_comparison ] in section  [ s : hk ] ) * comparisons for the bottom of the spectrum ( theorem  [ t : spectral_comparison ] in section  [ s : spectrum ] ) * comparisons for stochastic completeness ( theorem  [ t : sc_comparison ] in section  [ s : stochastic ] ) .",
    "the heat kernel comparison , theorem  [ t : hk_comparison ] , is given in the spirit of results of cheeger and yau @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to other works done for graphs in this area , e.g. @xcite , as we use weakly spherically symmetric graphs , we require very little symmetry for our comparison spaces .",
    "the comparisons are then done with respect to a certain curvature ( and , in the case of stochastic completeness , also to potential ) growth .",
    "we combine these inequalities with an analogue to a theorem of li @xcite , which was recently proven in our setting in @xcite , to obtain comparisons for the bottom of the spectrum , theorem  [ t : spectral_comparison ] .",
    "the spectral comparisons give some analogues to results of cheng @xcite and extend inequalities found for graphs in @xcite .",
    "the comparison results for stochastic completeness , theorem  [ t : sc_comparison ] , are inspired by work of ichihara @xcite and are found in section  [ s : stochastic ] .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce the set up .",
    "this is followed by the heat kernel theorems , theorem  [ t : hk_wsp ] and theorem  [ t : hk_comparison ] , in section  [ s : hk ] , the spectral estimates , theorem  [ t : spectrum ] and theorem  [ t : spectral_comparison ] , in section  [ s : spectrum ] and the considerations about stochastic completeness , theorem  [ t : stochastic ] and theorem  [ t : sc_comparison ] , in section  [ s : stochastic ] .",
    "the proofs are given within each section . in section  [",
    "s : application ] , we discuss the applications to unweighted graph laplacians and give the examples of polynomial volume growth announced above . finally , in appendix [ s : appendix ] , we prove some general facts concerning commuting operators which are used in the proof of theorem  [ t : hk_wsp ] .",

    "the map @xmath4 , which characterizes the edges , is symmetric and has zero diagonal . if @xmath5 , then we say that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are _ neighbors _ , writing @xmath8 , and think of @xmath9 as the weight of the edge connecting @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". moreover , let @xmath10 be a map which we call the _ potential _ or _ killing term_. if @xmath11 , then we think of @xmath6 as being connected to an imaginary vertex at infinity with weight @xmath12 .",
    "we call the quadruple @xmath13 a _ weighted graph_. whenever @xmath14 , we denote the weighted graph @xmath15 as the triple @xmath16 .",

    "we * assume * that all weighted graphs @xmath13 in question are connected and locally finite .    in this setting , weighted graph laplacians and dirichlet forms on discrete measure spaces were recently studied in @xcite ,",
