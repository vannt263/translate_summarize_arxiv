    "the distinctive band structure of two - dimensional electrons in a magnetic field has proved to be a rich setting for new and exciting physical phenomena . in particular , in the absence of interactions or disorder , the spectrum of single particle eigenstates breaks into degenerate bands called landau levels ( lls ) ; fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) physics@xcite occurs when interactions between electrons break the degeneracy of partially filled landau bands , leading to an incompressible fluid ground - state .",
    "quantum hall systems are typically characterized by a filling factor @xmath4 , which quantifies the ratio of the number of electrons in the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) to the number of flux quanta through the sample or , alternatively , the filling factor quantifies the number of filled lls in the system .",
    "naively , one might expect that the high magnetic field characteristic of the fractional quantum hall regime might remove any spin degree of freedom entirely .",
    "however in conventional gaas systems , owing to the small @xmath5 factor , even in fairly high fields , unpolarized or partially polarized quantum hall states may occur .",
    "the favorability of spin non - polarized states is generally determined by the ratio of the zeeman energy per electron , @xmath6 the energy associated with flipping a spin in magnetic field strength @xmath7 , to the coulomb energy per electron @xmath8 , the energy associated with the spatial configuration of electrons in the quantum hall system . for many quantum hall states ( particularly composite fermion states ) due to the pauli exclusion principle , the coulomb energy ( or , equivalently , the effective composite fermion kinetic energy ) can be lower if spins are not fully polarized . as a result , if the zeeman energy is not too large",
    ", quantum hall ground - states may not be fully spin polarized .    in a number of recent experiments",
    "the degree of spin polarization of quantum hall fluid has been explicitly measured as a function of the ratio of zeeman to coulomb energy for a variety of fixed filling factors .",

    "a non - trivial net spin polarization is observed at the following filling factors in the lowest landau level ( lll ) : @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in these experiments",
    "the aim is to keep the filling factor fixed while varying the ratio of the zeeman to the coulomb energy .",
    "this is achieved by varying both the applied field strength and the density of electrons in the sample , keeping their ratio ( hence @xmath4 ) fixed . for each filling factor , as the field strength",
    "is varied , the experiments report a set of plateau with constant spin polarization , punctuated by a series of relatively sharp transitions .",
    "similar conclusions can be inferred from data presented in ref .   at filling factors @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "for high field and high electron density , the spin is polarized , but as the field strength and electron density are reduced , there are transitions to fqh states of successively smaller net spin polarization until , finally , some lower bound of spin polarization is reached , with the particular lower bound depending on the filling factor .",
    "these transitions are observed to occur at some critical values of the applied field @xmath13 and there is , therefore , a corresponding critical zeeman energy per electron , @xmath14 .    from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "an exceptional phenomenological understanding of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) has been acquired via the concept of the composite fermion ( cf ) .",
    "@xcite the key notion of cf theory is that the problem of strongly interacting electrons in a perpendicular magnetic field can be mapped onto the problem of non - interacting cfs in an effective magnetic field .",
    "the direction of the effective magnetic field can be either parallel or antiparallel to the physical magnetic field .",
    "the cfs can be pictured as electrons bound to a certain number , @xmath15 , of magnetic flux quanta . in the effective magnetic field , there exist effective landau levels  these are completely analogous to the lls that occur for noninteracting electrons in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the fqhe of electrons can be interpreted as the integer quantum hall effect of cfs with @xmath15 fluxes attached and occupying a certain number @xmath16 of the effective lls ; this idea has proved to be very successful ( see , for example , j. k. jain s book , ref .  ) .",
    "the principal set of filling factors encompassed by cf theory are given by @xmath17 where the sign here indicates the direction of the effective field relative to the real magnetic field .",
    "taking into account the two spin species , particle - hole conjugate versions of these states occur at filling factors @xmath18 .    in cf theory , trial",
    "quantum hall states with a spin degree of freedom can be constructed by simply associating a spin degree of freedom with the cfs themselves .",

    "we choose to write wavefunctions in this geometry using a pair of complex spinor co - ordinates @xmath140 such that @xmath141    a magnetic field @xmath7 perpendicular to the surface of the sphere can be realized by placing a magnetic monopole at the center of the sphere : the total magnetic flux is @xmath142 ( here @xmath143 is the flux quantum @xmath144 ) . the radius of the sphere is then @xmath145 , in units of the magnetic length @xmath146 the flux is related to the filling factor by @xmath147 , where @xmath50 is the number of electrons and @xmath148 is called the shift . for spin - polarized cf states we have already derived ( in sec . [ wavefunctions ] )",

    "( [ effectiveflux ] ) , along with the definition @xmath150 , to find an expression for @xmath45 in terms of @xmath50 , @xmath151 the total flux is then again given by @xmath53 .",
    "in each case , in the thermodynamic limit , the sphere radius tends to infinity and so we recover a 2d plane geometry but without edge effects .",
    "the length scale set by the magnetic length @xmath152 is generally much smaller than the sphere radius , and so we argue that the physics remains independent of the system size and , therefore , taking the thermodynamic limit is valid .",
    "in this appendix we shall derive two results used in the paper : the degree of spin polarization @xmath153 and the proportion of spins @xmath154 which must flip when a spin transition takes place .",
    "the degree of spin polarization is defined by @xmath155 using eq .",
    "( [ effectiveflux ] ) and the fact that @xmath150 we can deduce for example that @xmath156 and so we have @xmath157 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath158 ) we recover eq .  [ degreeofspin ] .",
    "the proportion of electrons , @xmath154 , occupying the effective ll labelled by index @xmath159 and with @xmath44 effective flux , is given by @xmath160 substituting the expression for @xmath45 given in eq .",

    "in this work we apply the metropolis monte carlo algorithm @xcite to evaluate the ground - state energy of various trial wavefunctions .",
    "we wish to evaluate expectation values of operators @xmath163 with respect to the co - ordinate wavefunctions @xmath164 : @xmath165 the metropolis monte carlo procedure works by statistically sampling configurations of the co - ordinates @xmath166 drawn from the probability distribution @xmath167 the expectation value of the operator is then estimated using @xmath168 sets of co - ordinate samples : @xmath169 it can be shown that the standard deviation behaves as @xmath170 . in our simulations",
    "we typically used @xmath171 .",
    "composite fermion wavefunctions have been intensely scrutinized using mc methods .",
    "@xcite the principle difficulty for cf wavefunctions is the procedure for lll projection .",
    "the method for doing this projection for cf states in negative effective field was introduced in ref .  , and the resulting form of the generalized spherical harmonics is repeated here in eq .",
    "( [ cffinal ] ) . once written in this form ,",
    "the key difficulty lies in the evaluation of the multiple derivatives of the jastrow factor , @xmath172,\\ ] ] with @xmath65 a procedure for evaluating these derivatives is given in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  ) , and this method is also used in ref .  .",
    "briefly , the method is as follows : first , we pull the jastrow factor through the derivatives and write @xmath173,\\ ] ] where @xmath174 we then introduce @xmath175 from which one can deduce the recursion relations @xmath176 using these results , one can calculate a series of relations , for example , @xmath177    for cf wavefunctions in negative effective field we must take up to @xmath178 derivatives with respect to both @xmath179 and @xmath180 . as we take more derivatives ,",
    "the results of this method become increasingly complicated , particularly for smaller values of @xmath16 .",
    "we have determined an alternative method to evaluate the derivatives , which is at its most effective in precisely the regime where the current method runs into difficulties .",
    "we shall present our result for the case of @xmath22 only ; however , higher @xmath15 cases could be constructed along the same lines .",
    "let us re - state exactly what we need to evaluate , leaving out the un - important constant factors as they can be absorbed into the normalization  for each element of a n - by - n slater matrix we need to evaluate      it is insightful to expand out the @xmath83 product into a sum as follows : @xmath182 where @xmath183 denotes the degree @xmath184 elementary symmetric polynomial in the @xmath185 variables @xmath186 for @xmath187 , @xmath188 for @xmath187 .",
    "the elementary symmetric polynomials are defined by @xmath189 with this form for @xmath83 we now evaluate all of the necessary derivatives , which leaves us with : @xmath190    the expression in eq .",
    "( [ newform ] ) appears complicated at first sight , but notice that the sum over @xmath184 contains at most @xmath191 terms .",
    "if the cf state only fills a small number of effective lls ( i.e. , @xmath192 ) , then the number of terms in the sum is actually quite small .",
    "a key result is that the elementary symmetric polynomials can be calculated recursively using one of newton s identities , @xcite @xmath193 where @xmath194 are the power - sum polynomials .",
    "also , note the following recursive identity : @xmath195    wielding these two identities it is possible to build an efficient algorithm to generate the full set of @xmath196 for @xmath197 that is required to calculate the elements of the form @xmath198 for the @xmath199 slater matrix .",
    "once the slater matrix is populated , the remainder of the work is involved in calculating its determinant .",
    "the full algorithm evaluates the probability density of a given cf state for a given set of co - ordinates .",
    "based on the times recorded when running the program , our full algorithm evaluation time scales roughly as @xmath200@xmath201 , the better figure occurring for @xmath202 and the worse figure for @xmath132 , which confirms our assertion that our algorithm is more efficient for smaller values of @xmath16 .",
    "we note that the evaluation of the cf wavefunctions tends to suffer from a numerical precision issue , particularly for large @xmath50 . to overcome the issue we simply store all numerical values to a higher precision ",
    "although this slows down the algorithm considerably , we are able to obtain accurate results up to around @xmath203 , which is high enough for our purposes .",
    "note that the wavefunction of the form @xmath204 given in eq .",
    "( [ cfspinfinal ] ) is not quite complete : in fact wavefunctions @xmath205 describing @xmath50 fermions must be fully antisymmetric under any exchange of particle labels , but @xmath204 in eq .",
    "( [ cfspinfinal ] ) is only antisymmetric under exchange of labels 1 to @xmath33 and in labels @xmath82 to @xmath34 .",
    "the correct expression for the full wavefunction would be obtained by including a spin part to the wavefunction , @xmath206 , and then fully antisymmetrizing by applying the antisymmetrizing operator @xmath207 i.e. , we must construct @xmath208 . in practice , when calculating matrix elements of the form @xmath209 , as long as the operator @xmath210 does not depend on the spin state the matrix element reduces to @xmath211 because the spin wavefunctions are orthonormal .",
    "thus the version of the wavefunction given in eq .",
    "( [ cfspinfinal ] ) is sufficient .",
    "the differences between the disc geometry case and the sphere geometry case are the values of the coefficients @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ effectivepotential ] ) : in the disc geometry version of the potential the coefficients are derived using the disc geometry versions of the haldane pseudopotentials , whereas in the sphere geometry the coefficients are derived using the sphere geometry versions of the pseudopotentials ( see , for example , ref . ) . in the disc geometry",
    "the values of the coefficients are independent of the flux ; however , this is no longer true in the sphere geometry and a different set of coefficients ( and therefore a different effective potential ) must be calculated for each value of the flux .",
    "we have checked that in the thermodynamic limit the values of the sphere geometry coefficients tend toward the same fixed values given in table [ valuesofcoefficients ] , and thus it is sufficient to only consider the disc geometry version of the potential .      in principle , tilting the magnetic field can alter the effective interaction between the electrons by modifying the form of the wavefunction in the direction perpendicular to the electron layer .",
    "we have not accounted for this effect .",
    "however , we note that the in - plane magnetic length is never much less than the well width so this effect is not expected to be substantial ( see table [ valuesofd ] ) ."
