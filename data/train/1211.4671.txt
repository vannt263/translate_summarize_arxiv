    "improving the thermoelectric ( te ) energy conversion efficiency relies on increasing the thermoelectric response ( seebeck coefficient ) and reducing the thermal conductance of the device @xcite .",
    "metal - single molecule - metal junctions ( molecular junctions ) seem promising in both aspects : their thermal conductance is small due to the mismatch between the vibrations of the electrodes and the molecule , and their te response should be large due to the well - defined resonant structure of the electron transport ( via the molecular homo or lumo levels ) @xcite .",
    "this observation , along with the notion that te response can shed light on transport mechanisms in molecular junctions @xcite , have initiated in large number of experimental @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite on te effects in molecular junctions .",
    "most notable are a series of impressive experiments in which te conversion using a single - molecule junction was demonstrated @xcite . in these experiments , a single molecule ( usually benzene rings with various end groups ) is trapped between an au substrate and an au scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip , which are held at a constant temperature difference @xmath0 . a voltage bias @xmath1 ( here called thermo - voltage ) is then applied between the tip and substrate to reach a state of zero current flowing through the molecule .",
    "the seebeck coefficient is defined as ( minus ) the slope of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath0 in the linear response regime ( i.e. @xmath3 ) . in the experiments the value of @xmath4 is strongly fluctuating , and repeating the experiment many times results in a broad distribution of @xmath1 , as can be seen in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( and inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) here ) . using the typical @xmath1 ( where the voltage distribution displays a maximum ) , the authors of ref.@xcite find typical seebeck coefficients of the order of @xmath5v / k for single molecule junctions .",
    "the observed variations in the thermoelectric response do not seem to be simple ( gaussian ) noise , and the distributions of the thermo - voltage @xmath1 may have a well - defined double - peak structure @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .   concluded that the fluctuations ( also reported in thermoelectric measurements of metal - fullerene - metal junctions @xcite ) are caused by variations of the position of the homo level , which are translated into variations in the energy offset between the homo level and the fermi energy of the contacts , @xmath6 , as the junction reconstructs . assuming that the transport is dominated by a single resonant level and using the landauer formalism ( or green s function method ) for thermoelectric transport ( see , e.g. refs . )",
    "they quantified the variations @xmath7 in @xmath8 and found them to be @xmath9 , of the order of the average offset @xmath8 itself .    in this paper",
    "we argue that besides the variations in the offset energy between the homo level and the fermi energy , there is an additional contribution to the fluctuations in the thermopower , which is the strong variations of the ldos ( as a function of energy ) at the point of contact between the molecule and the electrodes .",
    "we use a toy model to verify this effect .",
    "the main results are ( i ) within the landauer or green s function formalism for thermoelectric transport , any variations in the transmission function which are smaller than the self - energy ( or level broadening ) are suppressed .",
    "the result is a smooth transmission function and a smooth thermopower ( as a function of energy).(ii ) the thermopower is extremely sensitive to small fluctuations of in the transmission function . as a result ,",
    "the suppression of fluctuations in the transmission function , inherent to the green s function method , strongly affects on the calculated thermopower , and results in an over - estimation for the fluctuations in the homo level - fermi level energy offset fluctuations .",
    "( iii ) the thermo - voltage histogram obtained using the green s function method is qualitatively different from the histograms obtained experimentally , and ( iv ) all of the above draw - backs of the green s function formalism can be overcome by using the open quantum system approach to calculating the thermo - electric response in molecular junctions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we derive the estimation for the fluctuations in the homo - fermi level energy offset from the experimental values of thermopower for typical molecular junctions , using a simple description of the molecular junction as a resonant level and using the landauer formula . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present the open quantum systems approach , and using a simple model for the molecular junction we show that this approach for calculation of thermopower yields results which are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we show that , _ for the same model _ , the green s function approach gives very different results , due to the inherent suppression of fluctuations built in to the method ( due to the presence of a self - energy of level broadening ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the thermopower is very sensitive to fluctuations , and thus the suppression of ( small ) fluctuations in the transmission strongly affects the calculation of thermo - power .",
    "[ sec4 ] is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "as a starting point , we consider the data presented in fig .  3 of ref .   ( also inset of fig .  [ fig2 ] here ) , where the thermo - voltage histograms of a 2,5-dimethyl-4,4-tribenzenedithiol ( dmtbdt ) molecular junction are presented .",
    "we observe several notable features : ( i ) noise is present in the measurement : even at @xmath10 there is a finite thermo - voltage distribution , with an average signal offset of a few tens of microvolts , ( ii ) the typical form of the thermo - voltage distribution seems gaussian , ( iii ) a double - peak structure of the distribution emerges , indicating two dominant values of the seebeck coefficient , @xmath11v / k and @xmath12v / k .    in order to estimate the variation in the molecular homo required to obtain these values , we use the standard landauer formalism . within this formalism",
    ", the conductance is given by @xmath13 , and the seebeck coefficient can be approximated as s- .",
    "|_=e_f  , [ landauers ] where @xmath14 is the electron energy , @xmath15 is the electron transmission function , @xmath16 is the proton charge , @xmath17 the boltzmann constant and @xmath18 is the average temperature .",
    "we proceed by assuming that the transport through molecule is characterized by a transmission through a resonant level . to justify this , as well as the toy model considered in the next section , we briefly review the literature on theoretical calculations of thermopower in molecular junctions .",
    "the most common theoretical tool to calculate the transmission ( and from it the thermopower ) is the combination of non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) and density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , where the transmission function is evaluated using the green s function as obtained from dft . within this approach",
    ", the transmission function is calculated as a function of gate voltage , and from it the thermopower is calculated , also as a function of gate voltage ( see , e.g. refs . ) . while in transport experiments gating of a molecule can be achieved @xcite , such a dependence of the thermopower on the gate voltage was never studied experimentally , and experiments always carry a statistical nature as discussed above .",
    "however , to our knowledge the statistical nature of thermopower in molecular junctions has never been addressed ( although it has been addressed in the context of transmission @xcite or thermopower of atomic wires @xcite ) . nevertheless , to justify our model we observe that in the theoretical calculations , the transmission function seems always to resemble a resonant level , at least close to the homo or lumo levels .",
    "thus , considering a resonant level model is a common description even of realistic molecules with electron interactions .    for a given resonant molecular level with energy @xmath19 and contact fermi energy @xmath20 ,",
    "the typical form of the transmission function is a resonant lorentzian , @xmath21 , where @xmath6 is the energy offset and  @xmath22 is the contact - induced effective level broadening .",
    "the resulting seebeck coefficient is of the form s-  .",
    "[ seebeck ]    noting the double - peak structure of the voltage distribution , we thus consider that there is a typical shift in the homo level @xmath23 .",
    "taking the conductance value to be @xmath24 , one needs to solve simultaneously @xmath25 these equations yield ( at ambient temperature ) @xmath26 ev , @xmath27ev and @xmath28 ev , such that @xmath29 , similar to the value obtained in ref .  .",
    "this means that the molecular level alignment with the contact fermi level is changing by @xmath30 electron - volts at every reconstruction of the junction .",
    "this large variation ( of the order of @xmath31 itself ) was attributed to variations in the junction contact geometry and intermolecular interactions . however , a recent study of transition voltage spectroscopy in molecular junctions ( see ref .   for description of the method )",
    "demonstrated that the variation of @xmath31 are of the order of @xmath32ev , @xcite much smaller than the variation required to generate the value above .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that there is an additional factor contributing to the variations in thermopower .",
    "the discrepancy describes above hints that there is a flaw in the analysis of the thermopower fluctuations using the landauer formula with the resonant level model . as we will show in the following sections ,",
    "the flaw is that the landauer formula inherently suppresses any variations in the transmission function ( as a function of molecular level energy @xmath8 ) which are on an energy scale smaller than the level broadening ( or electron self - energy ) , and since the thermopower is very sensitive to variations in the transmission , this suppression strongly affects the thermopower .",
    "thus , fluctuations in @xmath8 sample a thermopower function @xmath33 which is `` too smooth '' , resulting in the over - estimate of @xmath7 .",
    "in order to identify the origin of variations in the thermopower , we study a toy model of a molecular junction .",
    "we use the method of open quantum systems ( oqs ) ( which was described in detail in previous publications @xcite ) to show that the thermopower @xmath33 exhibits variations as a function of @xmath8 which are on the same energy scale as the variations in the ldos at the molecule - lead point of contact , and show that the thermo - voltage histogram resulting in fluctuations in @xmath8 is qualitatively similar to the experimental ones . in the next section we will compare the result",
    "ontained from the oqs method to those obtained by using negf method .",
    "our toy model consists of two finite electrodes with a molecular bridge between them ( upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , attached to reservoirs with different temperatures @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the left and right edges respectively .",
    "the molecule is described by a simple chain with four atomic orbitals .",
    "the oqs method enables one to calculate the electronic density in this non - equilibrium situation ( a finite temperature difference between the electrodes ) . from the electronic density",
    ", one can calculate ( via the poisson equation ) the voltage difference @xmath1 between the electrodes as a function of the temperature difference @xmath36 . repeating the calculation for different values of @xmath37",
    "we then find a curve @xmath38 , and the linear slope is the thermopower ( or seebeck coefficient ) @xmath39 .",
    "essentially , oqs theory is a mapping of the system hamiltonian @xmath40 ( which in general includes all electronic degrees of freedom , electron interactions , junction geometry etc . ) onto a master equation for the single - particle density matrix of the lindblad form @xcite , = -i[,]+[lindblad ]  .we consider a non - interacting tight - binding hamiltonian of the form @xmath41 , where _",

    "the external environment(s ) are accounted for in eq .",

    "an appropriate form for the @xmath50-operators is @xcite v^(l , r)_kk= | k k | [ opeq ]  , where @xmath51 are the fermi distributions of the left and right leads ( with the corresponding temperature ) , @xmath44 the chemical potential , and @xmath52 are the overlap integrals between the @xmath53 and @xmath54 states on the left ( l ) and right ( r ) edges of the electrodes .",
    "this form for the @xmath50-operators guarantees that at equilibrium ( i.e. @xmath55 ) the diagonal elements of the density matrix are described by a fermi function .",
    "we note that the lindblad equation assumes a markov approximation for the environment , which is reasonable since we are considering a system at room temperature ( where quantum memory effect of the environment should not be important ) , and since we are interested in the steady state ( and not the dynamics ) .",
    "the numerical calculation is performed in the following way : ( i ) from the tight - binding hamiltonian the single - particle states and energies are calculated , and the @xmath50-operators are constructed according to eq .",

    "( iii ) from the diagonal elements steady - state solution for @xmath57 and the wave functions , the electron density is calculated .",
    "( iv ) by solving the poisson equation , the voltage at the center of the electrodes is calculated .",
    "the voltage difference between the electrodes is the thermo - voltage , as it is induced by the temperature difference .",
    "the slope of the thermo - voltage as a function of the temperature difference is the thermopower .    0.5truecm   ( solid blue line ) and electron occupation of the molecular chain ( dashed orange line ) as a function energy @xmath8 ( see text for numerical parameters ) .",
    "as the molecular levels cross the electrode fermi energy ( which is set as the zero energy ) the occupancy of the dot change , and correspondingly the seebeck coefficient changes sign .",

    "( c ) temperature dependence of the seebeck coefficient ( at @xmath60 ) for various molecular chain lengths , exhibiting a non - monotonic temperature dependence . [ fig1 ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the the seebeck coefficient ( solid blue line ) and the electron occupation of the molecular chain ( dashed orange line ) of a model molecular junction as a function of a gate potential applied to the junction , i.e. as a function of the molecular energy level with respect to the fermi level ( which is set as the zero energy ) .",
    "the junction is composed of a series of four atomic orbitals connected to square two dimensional electrodes ( upper panel ) .",
    "numerical parameters are : electrode size @xmath61 , tight - binding hopping integral @xmath43ev ( corresponding to a band - width of @xmath62ev ) , electrode - molecule coupling is @xmath63ev , temperature is room temperature , @xmath64 and the electrodes are kept at half filling .    the first thing to be noted is that whenever a molecular orbital crosses the fermi energy , the molecular occupation changes by one , and the thermopower changes sign .",
    "this is in accord with the known results from the landauer formula for thermopower , and is due to the change from electron - dominated to hole - dominated transport every time the fermi level is crossed ( which also corresponds to a transmission resonance ) .",
    "the second important feature is that , in contrast to the result expected from the regular landauer formula @xcite , the seebeck coefficient exhibits strong variations with gate voltage .",
    "before we proceed to discussing the origin of these variations , it is useful to compare the properties of the seebeck coefficient as obtained from the oqs method to those known from the landauer formalism . in fig .",

    "an inhomogeneous temperature dependence is found , originating from a crossover from coherent to incoherent transport , again in agreement with results obtained from the landauer formalism ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that the main physical features of the thermopower which are present in the landauer formalism , also appear within the framework of the oqs theory .",

    "to mimic the experiment , we also apply a small variation ( two degrees kelvin ) to the electrode temperatures ( note that in the experiments , a finite thermo - voltage distibution was observed even at @xmath10,see inset of fig .",

    "note that these variations are a surface effect , and are not due to the electrode level spacing ( the average level spacing is @xmath73 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that it is the variations in the ldos ( which are on an energy scale much smaller than the energy difference between the molecular levels ) that give rise to the sensitivity of @xmath71 ( we note that the total dos of the electrodes is a much smoother function with no observed variations on these energy scales ) .",
    "we point that the ldos variations are not a finite - size effect , but rather are a surface effect . calculating the ldos to systems as large as @xmath74 ( where the level spacing is @xmath75ev )",
