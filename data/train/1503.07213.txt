    "coherent chains of interacting quantum systems represent a wide class of physical objects that define the behavior of matter under different physical conditions .",
    "study of theoretical models for these objects , which was started by the epoch - making works by hubbard @xcite and ising @xcite , covers both new forms of matter and new types of interactions @xcite .",
    "one can coherently chain cooled atoms in optical lattices @xcite , josephson qubits in microwave transmission lines @xcite , semiconductor quantum dots , etc .",
    "interactions between systems can be of quite different physical nature : spin - exchange interactions or pseudospin interactions corresponding to the dipole optical transitions @xcite , tunneling @xcite , dipole - dipole interactions @xcite , photonic interactions ( jaynes - cummings - hubbard model @xcite ) and many others .",
    "recent applications of these models led to a number of new fundamental results .",
    "for example , 1d - chain of tunnel - coupled systems with two ends connected to heat reservoirs served as a model to justify the fourier heat conduction law from the first principles and to provide microscopic definition of temperature @xcite .",
    "other results to be mentioned are the directivity of collective spontaneous emission @xcite ) , possibility to transfer quantum states @xcite , the spatial propagation of rabi oscillations ( rabi - waves ) @xcite , and quantum optical nonreciprocity of the medium in timed dicke state @xcite .",
    "it is of particular importance to study new types of interactions that determine the coherent behavior of coupled systems .",
    "here we suggest to couple them in a chain by connecting them pair - wisely to common dissipative reservoirs .",
    "it is already well - known that coupling several quantum systems to the same dissipative reservoir allows to obtain a number of highly non - trivial effects .",
    "first of all , such a coupling can create a decoherence - free subspace @xcite . an arbitrary initial state is eventually transferred into this subspace .",
    "thus , it is possible to produce non - classical and entangled states via dissipative dynamics even without any direct interaction between quantum systems @xcite .",
    "this effect has many potential applications .",
    "for example , it was recently used in practice to protect the highly - entangled initial polarization states of photons from dephasing in optical fibers @xcite . moreover , combining coupling to the same reservoir with the nonlinear interaction between quantum systems , it is possible to produce nonlinear loss generating robustly a wide variety of non - classical states @xcite . by adding external driving ,",
    "a generated non - classical state can be preserved in the presence of an arbitrarily large linear loss @xcite .    ) .",
    "( below ) a scheme of dissipatively coupled tight - binding spin chain described by eq .",
    "( [ chain1 ] ) . ]    here we show that by coupling a set of quantum systems through common markovian reservoirs and forming one - dimensional tight - binding chain , it is possible to produce highly non - trivial dynamics . such a dissipatively coupled set of just a few two - level system renders a possibility to reproduce dynamics of far more complex systems , such as classical heat reservoirs and multidimensional random networks .",
    "this dynamics can be `` tuned '' by choice of the initial state of the system .",
    "we demonstrate that even for a few systems in the chain certain groups of matrix elements of the chain density matrix evolve according to equations formally coinciding with the equations describing classical random walks . for no more than one initial excitation in the chain ,",
    "matrix elements of the single - excitation subspace evolve according to the equation describing two - dimensional classical random walk .",
    "simultaneously , matrix elements describing coherences between the single - excitation and zero - excitation subspaces evolve according to the equation describing one - dimensional random walk . taking more than one initial excitation in the chain ,",
    "one is able to obtain dynamics governed by equations describing multi - dimensional classical random walks .",
    "this fact leads to a number of quite - counterintuitive consequences .",
    "notwithstanding the markovianity of reservoirs , a decay of excitation in any system of the chain is polynomial with the same power . by choosing the initial states",
    ", it is possible to obtain a population decay law @xmath0 , for an arbitrary @xmath1 , provided that the chain is long enough .",
    "the sum of density matrix elements described by the random walk equation is conserved .",
    "so , one can observe rather peculiar thermodynamics - like behaviour of the chain . despite seemingly classical character , this `` thermodynamics '' is quite anomalous .",
    "the stationary state of the chain can be entangled .",
    "moreover , energy flow through the chain is not described by the fourier law , whereas the flow of coherences is governed by it .",
    "the outline of paper is as follows . in the section [ secchain ]",
    "we introduce the concept of tight - binding dissipatively coupled quantum chain .",
    "also , we show how this `` quantum gadget '' can be built in practice from usual tight - binding unitary chain by selectively applying strong dissipation to certain systems in the chain . in the section [ single ]",
    "we derive equations for the simplest case of the chain dynamics corresponding to an initial state with no more than just one excitation .",
    "already in this case the chain exhibits a rich variety of highly unusual phenomena .",
    "we highlight the thermodynamical analogies in the section [ therm ] . in the section [ polynomial ]",
    "we analyze in more details possibilities of having different polynomial decay for specific choices of initial states of the chain .",
    "then , in the section [ multidy ] we discuss the dynamics of the chain in the case of multiple initial excitations demonstrating how conservation of coherences might arise in this case , too .",
    "here we are discussing dynamics of a set of quantum objects coupled only through common dissipative reservoirs .",
    "we are interested in dynamics arising for the case when our set is rather large ( with the number of objects , @xmath2 ) . in this paper",
    "we consider one of the simplest cases of such a set , namely , a tight - binding one - dimensional chain of identical two - level systems ( tls ) , e.  g. , spins or pseudo - spins . the general scheme of such an arrangement is as follows .",
    "each spin is supposed to be coupled to common markovian reservoirs with one of two neighbors : @xmath3th tls and @xmath4th tls are coupled to common @xmath3th reservoir , @xmath5th tls and @xmath3th tls are coupled to @xmath5th reservoir , etc .",
    "reservoirs are supposed to be independent ( see fig.[fig1 ] ( below ) ) .",
    "thus , we are considering here dynamics of the compound object described by the following generic effective master equation : @xmath6 where linbdlad operators are @xmath7 and @xmath8 are rasing / lowering operators for the @xmath3th tls .",
    "vectors @xmath9 describe excited / ground states of the @xmath3th tls .",
    "quantities @xmath10 are relaxation rates into corresponding reservoirs . for simplicity sake , we consider the finite - size homogeneous chain , thus we take @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a given constant and @xmath13 is the total number of tls in the chain , whereas @xmath14 is the total number of reservoirs .",
    "the definition ( [ defgamma ] ) corresponds to the total insulation of the chain from the outside areas of space , i.e. , the absence of quantum flux over the chain boundaries .",
    "notice that eq.([chain1 ] ) is the quite general and describes a 1d set of pairwise dissipatively coupled systems .",
    "a number of different physical models can lead to such an equation .",
    "for example , similar band structure of dissipators can arise in a graphenelike models based on a honeycomb lattice with nearest - neighbor and next nearest- neighbor couplings ( haldane model ) @xcite .",
    "now let us discuss some simple cases as to demonstrate feasibility of dissipatively coupled chain and possibility to realize it in practice .",
    "first of all , let us point out that the dissipatively coupled chain can be produced just by subjecting some elements of a usual tight - binding chain with exchange interaction ( like dipole - dipole or spin - spin interactions ) to strong markovian loss .",
    "such a lattice with the regular pattern of dissipative sites ( the every second one ) were considered recently in the context of quantum walks and was shown to exhibit such non - trivial effects as topological transitions @xcite .",
    "so , let us consider a simple example of a tight - binding 1d chain of tls with every second tls coupled to the separate bosonic reservoir ( see fig.[fig1](above ) ) .",
    "such a system is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath15 where the hamiltonian @xmath16 describes non - interacting chain systems with the transition frequency @xmath17 ( we are using the system units with @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 and the hamiltonian of direct spin - spin ( or dipole - dipole ) interaction is @xmath20 the hamiltonian , @xmath21 , describes modes of independent bosonic reservoirs coupled to the corresponding tls of the chain @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the frequency of the bosonic mode described by the annihilation operator , @xmath24 , and the creation operator @xmath25 .",
    "the operator @xmath26 describes coupling of the chain systems to dissipative reservoirs , and can be represented as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the interaction constant for coupling of the @xmath29-th chain systems with the mode @xmath24 .    in the interaction picture with respect to the bosonic reservoirs hamiltonian , @xmath21 , and",
    "the chain hamiltonian , @xmath30 , the total hamiltonian ( [ ham0 ] ) becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 and reservoir operators are @xmath33    we assume that our bosonic reservoirs are markovian , mutually independent , and initially in the vacuum state .",
    "so , the following relations hold @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the decay rate into @xmath29-th reservoir , @xmath36 is the dirac delta - function and the averaging denoted by @xmath37 is carried over the states of reservoirs .    now let us suggest that only the every second system of the reservoir is subjected to loss , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "also , we assume that losses are occurring on the time - scale much shorter than the dynamics of the excitation exchange described by the hamiltonian ( [ exchange ] ) .",
    "then , taking for simplicity equal decay rates , @xmath39 , in the basis rotating with the frequency @xmath17 , one arrives at the following master equation @xmath40 + \\sum\\limits_{l}\\gamma\\left(2\\sigma_{2l}^-\\bar{\\rho } \\sigma_{2l}^+-\\bar{\\rho } \\sigma_{2l}^+\\sigma_{2l}^--\\sigma_{2l}^+\\sigma_{2l}^-\\bar{\\rho}\\right ) ,   \\label{chain0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us assume that tls corresponding to dissipative sites are initially in the ground states . if the dissipation rate , @xmath41 , is high enough in comparison with the strengths of direct interaction between neighboring spins , @xmath42 , variables corresponding to tls with even numbers can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "indeed , in this case for the dissipative sites we have @xmath43 then , taking tls in dissipative sites as reservoirs and deriving the master equation up to the second order with respect to the ratio @xmath44 ( see , for example , @xcite ) , one can obtain from the master equation ( [ chain0 ] ) the master equation eq.([chain1 ] ) describing dissipatively coupled tight - binding chain with the dissipative rate @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated one of the ways to obtain the dissipatively coupled chain .",
    "one can get it as the limiting case of a usual tight - binding chain with some sites subjected to losses .",
    "such a bipartite dissipative lattice shown in fig.[fig1](b ) can be realized in practice in a lot of different ways .",
    "for example , it can be build using a chain of color - center defects in diamond microcrystallites @xcite .",
    "for color - center defects in diamond microcrystallites it is typical to have very low decoherence rates even at room temperature .",
    "such objects can be manipulated with high precision and addressed individually by applied external electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "also , chains of individually manipulated atoms deposited on the metallic surface can be used for the purpose @xcite . among possible perspective candidates",
    "one can mentions schemes with trapped ions in optical lattices @xcite , photonic structures described by jaynes - cummings - hubbard model @xcite , coupled system of optical waveguides @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in multiple - well potentials @xcite , or even networks of pigments in light - harvesting molecules @xcite .    to realize the chain it is not necessary to manipulate `` chain links '' with high precision and address them individually .",
    "in our example , one can avoid coupling strongly dissipative reservoirs to the every second tls in the chain .",
    "restrictions imposed on precision of individual addressing can be significantly relaxed , if one considers a strongly coupled sufficiently long sub - chain instead of just one tls as a lossy system to be adiabatically eliminated ( an example of realistic consideration of such a dissipative sub - chain one can see , for example , in ref .",

    "( [ heat1 ] ) and also manifests an algebraic law of population decay , @xmath93 @xcite .",

    "the reason for it is the formal equivalence of eq.([wave function4 ] ) to the master equation with nonlocal lindblad operators .",
    "this nonlocality arises from non - conservation of the excitation number and from accounting for quantum states corresponding to two excited atoms and one virtual photon with `` negative '' energy @xcite .",

    "tell us that elements of the density matrix in the energy eigenstates basis evolve according to classical equations .",
    "however , despite this fact , the energy flow through the 1d chain can not be described by the 1d classical fourier law even in the limit of the large number of tls in the chain .",

    "( [ chain2 ] ) , for example , for the initial state being just one completely excited tls , the total population behaves in the following way : @xmath95 a physical reason for breaking the classical fourier heat conductivity law is rather simple . besides the energy transport occurring in one dimension ( along the chain ) , there is an additional motion .",
    "fourier law is always breaking down in presence of additional motions ( the simplest example is the convection in liquids @xcite ) . in our case",
    "this additional motion is a flow of quantum coherence .",
    "indeed , in the continuous approximation the energy flux along the chain reads as @xmath96 the right - hand part of this equation can not be represented in the form of the gradient of a scalar function satisfying the 1d heat - transfer equation .",
    "thus , the right - hand part of eq.([tr ] ) , or the energy per tls , @xmath97 , can not be associated with classical temperature @xcite . since in our chain not only energy is transported , but also quantum coherences , it is possible to introduce the concept of the effective 2d `` quantum temperature '' and 2d quantum flux as , correspondingly , @xmath98 the value of the real energy flux corresponds to the @xmath99-component of quantum flux , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the unit vector along the chain , while the @xmath102-component describes the coherences transfer .",
    "this additional motion produces a second dimension in the heat transfer equation and leads to the anomalous thermodynamics .",
    "a number of examples of an anomalous thermodynamical behavior for quantum structures is known ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "but the dissipatively coupled chain differs starkly by the nature of anomaly .",

    "the dissipatively coupled chain offers unique possibility of controlling the quantum state dynamics . just by choosing different initial state",
    ", one can manipulate the law of spontaneous decay .",
    "also , dependence of the decay law on the type of initial state gives one an opportunity of identifying initial states of the chain by measuring the population of just one tls .",

    "if one has initially several uncorrelated excited tls being far from another , the whole chain behaves like a set of unconnected chains with just one excitation per chain till the excitation spreads to neighbouring tls .",

    "let us demonstrate an appearance of such a `` conservation law of a sorts '' with the example of two initially non - interacting chains with no more that one excitation in each .",
    "so , we take that there are chains of @xmath147 and @xmath14 tls with both @xmath148",
    ". also , corresponding sums of coherences ( [ conservation ] ) , denoted as @xmath149 and @xmath150 are supposed to be much less than number of tls , @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "we assume that the chains are initially in the stationary states , @xmath153 where @xmath152 , the vectors @xmath154 are given by eq.([stationary ] ) and vectors @xmath155 describe the lowest energy state of corresponding chains .",
    "now let us assume that the chains are coupled by the common dissipative reservoir connecting the last tls of the first chain and the first tls of the second chain ( the rate of decay to this reservoir we take to be the same @xmath12 as the rates for all other reservoirs ) .",
    "then , the stationary state of compound chain will be obviously given also by eq.([spreader2 ] ) with @xmath156 .",
    "it is easy to get from eqs.([chain4 ] ) and ( [ chain5 ] ) that the sum of coherences for the new stationary state is @xmath157 notice that the expression ( [ wmn ] ) becomes exact in the limit @xmath158 .",
    "so , the sum of coherences for the stationary state of the compound chain is indeed approximately equal to the same of coherences of parts .",
    "moreover , if one disconnects chains and they settle into stationary states again , the value of matrix elements of single - excitation density matrix ( the `` quantum temperature '' as introduced in the section [ therm ] ) for both part will remain to be equal , @xmath159 .",
    "we have suggested and discussed a tight - binding dissipatively coupled quantum chain .",
    "it consists of two - level systems pairwise coupled to the same markovian reservoirs .",
    "we have shown that despite being composed of a comparatively few systems forming the simplest one - dimensional chain , such a chain can model a multi - dimensional random walk , or model a solution of multi - dimensional heat - transfer equation . in difference to the classical `` original '' , it is possible to model heat flow from initial distributions with regions of positive and negative temperatures .",
    "such possibility of quantum stimulations in many - body physics corresponds to the long - standing idea first proposed by r. feinman and recently cited by c. cohen - tannoudji and d. guery - odelin as a conclusive remark to their book @xcite .",
    "this model exhibits anomalous thermodynamics behavior , such as non - fourier heat conductivity and non - existence of temperature in the classical meaning .",
    "the population dynamics of all tls in the chain is always non - exponential and exhibit polynomial character . by the choice of the initial state ,",
    "different power laws of decay , @xmath0 , for an arbitrary @xmath1 can be achieved .",
    "the suggested chain can be used as an efficient simulator of classically hard problems , such as multi - dimensional quantum walks or heat - transfer equations .",
    "note , that the considered chain is not unique .",
    "one can build a number of different dissipatively coupled chains , for example , by changing phases in the system - system interaction terms in the chain .",
