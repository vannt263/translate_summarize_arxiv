    "dilute solutions of long polymers show a fascinating variety of unusal flow phenomena @xcite .",
    "recent effects include the formation of vortex pairs in viscoelastic taylor - couette flow @xcite and a phenomenon called elastic turbulence @xcite .",
    "while many phenomena in the laminar regime can be understood within simple constitutive equations @xcite , the interplay with turbulence has remained less clear . in particular , the drag reduction by minute amounts of long polymers in turbulent flows @xcite awaits explanation .",
    "various experiments have established that drag reduction comes about when the relaxation time of the polymers is comparable to the fluctuation times in the velocity field @xcite . and it is known that a long polymer undergoes a transition to an uncoiled state when exposed to sufficient strain @xcite .",
    "our aim here is to study the interaction of a polymer with a turbulently fluctuating flow , in particular the transition from the coiled to the stretched state as the internal relaxation rate becomes comparable to the velocity gradients , and to compare to the theoretical predictions of balkovsky _ et al .",
    "specifically , they predict an algebraic distribution for the trace of the configuration tensor with an exponent that depends linearly on the deborah number and an internal stretching rate of the flow .",
    "moreover , if the strain is so strong as to uncoil the flow , this process comes to a stop through its effect on small - scale fluctuations of the flow .",
    "we model the polymer by an upper convected maxwell fluid with a single relaxation time @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the polymer is characterized by the conformation tensor @xmath4 . within a dumb - bell model",
    "@xcite this tensor can be formed from the end - to - end distance vector @xmath5 as @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes a thermal average . in the coiled state",
    "the polymers are spherical and @xmath8 can be normalized so that @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the maxwell model the relaxation of the polymers is assumed to be linear , so that the dynamical equations become @xmath11 with @xmath3 as the time constant and @xmath12 as the convective derivative .",
    "the polymers are assumed to be diluted in a newtonian solvent so that for the flow properties also the newtonian shear viscosity has to be included .",
    "this then defines an oldroyd - b model @xcite .",
    "the oldroyd - b model is able to describe two main features of viscoelasticity , namely normal stress differences and stress relaxation , and has been succesfully applied in the study of vortex pairs in couette - taylor flow @xcite .",
    "the main caveat of this model , the divergence of the conformation tensor when the shear rate of the flow exceeds @xmath13 is usually overcome with the fene model @xcite .",
    "however , as predicted by balkovsky et  al . @xcite and demonstrated below the extension of the polymer is stabilized through the feedback on the flow once it begins to expand .",
    "we want to study the turbulence of a flow bounded by two surfaces and driven by a volume force that maintains a constant mean shear gradient @xmath14 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this gives an external length scale @xmath15 ( distance between surfaces ) and a velocity scale @xmath16 ( twice the velocity difference across the gap ) .",
    "used in the code . ] the reynolds number then is @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the kinematic viscosity , and the deborah number ( characterizing the polymer relaxation ) is @xmath19 .",
    "the dimensionless navier - stokes and oldroyd - b equations become @xmath20    the relation of stress and conformation tensor is given by @xmath21 the parameter @xmath22 in ( [ eq.m.tc ] ) models the strength of the feedback of the polymers on the turbulent flow . together with the condition of incompressibility , @xmath23 and a prescribed external force @xmath24 , the set of equations  form a closed system for the variables @xmath25 , @xmath4 and @xmath26 .",
    "the advantage of writing the oldroyd - b equation in terms of the conformation tensor @xmath27 instead of the polymer stress tensor @xmath28 is that even for @xmath29 , when the polymer has no influence on the velocity field and @xmath30 , it is still possible to monitor @xmath27 and thus the stretching and rotation of the polymer by the flow .",
    "the model geometry ( see fig .  [ fig.m.geom ] ) resembles planar couette flow , i.e.  flow between infinite , parallel plates , but with free - slip ( or stress - free ) boundary conditions along the planes instead of no - slip boundary conditions . with these boundary conditions all fields",
    "can be expanded in fourier series and efficient algorithms can be used . in our dimensionless units",
    "the box has dimensions @xmath31\\times[0,l_y]\\times[0,l_z]$ ] .",
    "model geometry : the flow is restricted to the volume between the shaded planes , with no - flux , free - slip boundary conditions at the planes . it is periodically continued in the @xmath32- and @xmath33-direction . ]    while any quantity is taken to be periodic in the @xmath32- and @xmath33-direction , boundary conditions in the @xmath34-direction are somewhat more complicated and must be formulated for each quantity separately . for the velocity ,",
    "they are @xmath35 this translates for the solvent stress tensor @xmath36 into @xmath37 the boundary conditions on @xmath38 and @xmath4 must be the same as on @xmath36 , @xmath39    instead of considering the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath4 over @xmath40 and with boundary conditions and , one can extend them to @xmath41\\times[0,l_y]\\times[0,l_y]$ ] by reflection at the @xmath42-plane .",
    "the equations of motion and are invariant under this transformation . along the boundary of @xmath43 ,",
    "any quantity then obeys periodic boundary conditions and can be expanded in a three - dimensional fourier series .",
    "mirror symmetry and boundary conditions restrict modes in the @xmath34-direction to either sines or cosines .",
    "the simulation code is actually written for mixed fourier ( @xmath44 ) and sine / cosine ( @xmath34 ) expansion coefficients .",
    "the reality condition , relations between coefficients resulting from incompressibility and de - aliasing by the 2/3 rule @xcite lead to a further reduction in the number of independent variables . in the end one",
    "is left with @xmath45 independent coefficients , where @xmath46 for a spatial grid of @xmath47 points .",
    "the numerical algorithm employed for time integration is a 5(4)-dormand - prince scheme @xcite with fixed step size .",
    "this scheme uses five evaluations of the right hand side to calculate an approximation for @xmath48 , @xmath49 with coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 chosen to minimize the error accumulated over @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "then , using the derivative @xmath53 ( which can be kept for the next integration step ) , a second approximation @xmath54 of lower order can be obtained .",
    "the difference @xmath55 is used as an estimate for the integration error . in standard applications",
    "this error is then used to adapt the step size . however , in a turbulent flow with its ever present fluctuations , variations in this step size are small .",
    "so instead we monitor this error estimate by calculating a combination of relative and absolute error , @xmath56 with @xmath57 an accuracy of @xmath58 was maintained throughout the integration .",
    "the volume force @xmath24 was chosen so as to maintain the mean shear profile ( dimensionless form ) @xmath59 as an approximation to a linear profile @xmath60 . in the simulations , @xmath61 , and the fourier components contained in this mean profile",
    "were kept fixed .",
    "thus the force is dynamically adjusted to maintain the prescribed mean shear profile .    one way to initialize",
    "the program is to use a random velocity perturbation on the laminar profile and the conformation tensor for the laminar profile . in order to obtain a turbulent state",
    "the perturbation has to be about as large as the laminar profile . in",
    "turns out , however , that even for moderate deborah numbers @xmath62 this leads to an extreme overshooting of the conformation tensor and a breakdown of the integration routine .",
    "as a remedy to this we used initial conditions from a turbulent newtonian flow with equilibrium configuration tensor , @xmath63 .",
    "the system was then allowed to relax to a statistically stationary turbulent state for a small value of the deborah number .",
    "one of these states was then taken as initial condition for a simulation at a higher @xmath2 . proceeding in this manner at each change of @xmath2",
    "the system relaxed to a statistically stationary state within a few time steps and no further numerical integration problems were encountered .    another numerical problem for oldroyd - b simulations",
    "is connected with the fact that the conformation tensor @xmath4 is by definition positive definite , and that this property is preserved by the oldroyd - b equations @xcite but not in the numerical representation . through the various fourier transforms and truncations , this positivity can be lost .",
    "if that happens the oldroyd - b model can develop hadamard instabilities , and lose its evolutionary character @xcite .",
    "thus , if regions with negative @xmath8 appear , numerical instabilities can arise and the integration can blow up @xcite .",
    "[ fig.r.positrace ] shows that such regions indeed do accur , but remain limited to a small fraction of the whole domain , provided @xmath2 is not too large .",
    "probability density functions ( pdfs ) of @xmath64 in a turbulent flow at different @xmath2 .",
    "there are hardly any regions with negative @xmath65 for @xmath66 ( open triangles ) and a significant fraction for @xmath67 ( open circles ) . adding an artifical diffusivity of @xmath68 removes the negative values and leaves the positive distribution essentially unchanged ( filled circles ) .",

    "although for the small values of @xmath2 in fig .  [ fig.r.positrace ] no numerical instability seems to occur , the introduction of a small @xmath78 does reduce the probability for negative @xmath64 , while the impact on positive values is much less significant . in the following ,",
    "calculations for @xmath79 are without artificial stress diffusivity ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the number of points with @xmath81 is then negligible . for @xmath82 ,",
    "a small @xmath68 is employed to reduce negative tails of pdfs , and for @xmath83 it is actually necessary to set @xmath84 to avoid numerical instability . in both cases , a certain probability for negative",
    "@xmath64 is still unavoidable .",
    "the simulation code is written in fortran 90 ( except the special fft routines for cray t90 hardware ) .",
    "it is based on the code used previously @xcite for the same model without polymer .",
    "most simulations were done on a cray t90 vector machine at the john von neumann institute for computing at the research centre jlich . a typical run with a resolution of @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 over @xmath85 time units",

    "@xcite discuss the behaviour of the pdf for the polymer extension @xmath87 . for a passive polymer ,",
    "they predict a power law decay of the tails ( @xmath88 ) , as long as the ( dimensionless ) relaxation time of the polymer @xmath2 is smaller than the inverse shear rate @xmath89 of the underlying turbulent flow , @xmath90 the exponent @xmath91 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath1 . for relaxation times near the inverse lyapunov exponent , @xmath91 is given in linear approximation by @xmath92 for deborah numbers smaller than @xmath93 the exponent @xmath91 is positive and actually describes an algebraic decay .",
    "this corresponds to the majority of the polymer molecules being near their equilibrium elongation .",
    "however , for values above the critical deborah number @xmath93 the exponent @xmath91 becomes negative and the probability density function for @xmath94 is no longer normalizable . at this point",
    "the assumption of a passive polymer becomes unphysical .",
    "@xcite then argue that the feedback from the polymer to the flow field limits the extension , such that @xmath95 decays again for large @xmath94 .",

    "the contribution of the polymer stress @xmath96 to the right hand side of the navier - stokes equation should then be of the same order of magnitude as the advective term @xmath97 .",
