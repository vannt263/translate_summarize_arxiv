    "large extra dimensions have been introduced as a way of solving the hierarchy problem , related to the hierarchy between the planck and the weak scales . in flat extra dimensions ,",
    "this can be achieved by assuming that the standard model ( sm ) fields are localized on a four dimensional brane , while gravity propagates in the extra dimensional bulk @xcite . under such conditions ,",
    "the fundamental planck scale may be of order of the weak scale .",
    "the weakness of the gravitational interactions is explained by the large volume suppression of the zero mode graviton interactions with the localized sm fields . for this mechanism to work , the size of the extra dimensions must be several orders of magnitude larger than the fundamental scale of the model .",
    "an interesting alternative is achieved in the case of warped extra dimensions proposed by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite . in this case",
    ", one can obtain a solution to the hierarchy problem by assuming that the gravity field propagates in the bulk of a slice of 5-dimensional anti de sitter space ( ads@xmath0 ) bounded by 4-dimensional  branes \" , while the higgs field is localized on the brane where the warp factor is small ( the tev or ir brane ) . in this case , all mass parameters , the fundamental planck scale , the curvature and the size of the extra dimensions , as well as the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , are of the same order . due to the nontrivial warp factor , however , the observable higgs vev is red - shifted to values much smaller than the fundamental planck scale .    in the minimal model of warped extra dimensions",
    "only gravity propagates in the bulk , while the sm gauge and fermion fields are localized on the same brane as the higgs field .",
    "the solution to the hierarchy problem , however , demands only the localization of the higgs field , and there is strong motivation to consider the propagation of the gauge fields in the bulk of the extra dimension .",
    "in particular , at scales below the ads curvature @xmath1 , the gauge couplings evolve logarithmically @xcite , and unification of couplings in these scenarios may be naturally achieved whenever the gauge fields propagate in the bulk @xcite ( for a related discussion in a supersymmetric context , see @xcite ) .",
    "bulk gauge fields are , however , phenomenologically challenging since they tend to induce large corrections to the precision electroweak observables .",
    "these corrections are induced by a combination of two effects : for one , the presence of a localized higgs vev induces a repulsion of the zero mode of the gauge fields from the brane location , implying a modification of the weak gauge boson couplings to the brane fields and of the relation between the tree - level weak gauge boson masses and the higgs vev .",
    "since these higgs localization effects are absent for the photon field , and are different for the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 gauge bosons , this induces important tree - level corrections to the precision electroweak observables @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the gauge fields couple to the brane fields with a coupling which is @xmath4 times larger than the zero mode gauge coupling , where @xmath5 is the proper size of the extra dimension .",
    "the dimensionless factor @xmath6 has to be about 30 so that the higgs vev is red - shifted from the planck to the tev scale .",
    "therefore , the kk modes couple strongly to the brane quark and lepton fields and can induce large effects on the precision electroweak observables .",
    "the above effects imply a lower bound on the mass of the lightest kk mode of the gauge fields of the order of @xmath7 tev @xcite .",
    "such a large bound excludes the possibility of direct detection of these kk modes at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "it also reintroduces to some extent the hierarchy problem that the rs scenario intended to solve .",
    "however , in refs .  @xcite it was shown that these bounds may be relaxed by considering the possible effect of brane localized kinetic terms for the gauge fields @xcite .",
    "large brane kinetic terms have the effect of enhancing the four dimensional properties of the gauge fields as seen by brane observers .",
    "in particular , the presence of gauge kinetic terms on the ir brane , where the higgs and fermion fields are localized , translates into a reduction of the higgs localization effects , as well as of the effective coupling of the heavy kk modes with respect to the one of the zero modes .",
    "in addition , the kk masses depend strongly on the ir brane kinetic term and can decrease by up to a factor of ten when these terms are large ( and positive ) . as a result ,",
    "the bound on the mass of the lightest gauge kk mode mass may be relaxed down to a few tev . moreover ,",
    "if the heavy flavor z - pole observables are excluded from the data , it was found that , for certain values of the weak gauge boson kk masses and of the local gauge kinetic terms , the fit to the precision electroweak observables improves with respect to the one obtained within the standard model with no extra dimensions .    in this work",
    "we are interested in considering the scenario of warped extra dimensions in the light of grand unification .",
    "the above described scenario , with the lightest kk modes in the few tev range , requires large brane kinetic terms on the ir brane",
    ". however , we will find that it is necessary to assume that the gut symmetry is broken on the ir brane , which implies that the local kinetic terms need not be unified . indeed , generically the brane kinetic terms include bare contributions , which encode the physics at or above the cutoff scale , as well as radiative contributions that are calculable within the effective 5-dimensional theory . on the ir brane , the latter effects are small since the local cutoff is not much above the tev scale and there is no room for a large logarithmic enhancement .",
    "hence , a large ir brane kinetic term would have to arise from the unknown uv physics and it becomes necessary to assume that this physics respects the gut symmetry .",
    "the situation is different for the uv brane kinetic terms since there the local cutoff is of the order of the planck scale and the loop contributions are logarithmically enhanced at low energies .",
    "in fact , the large gut violating logarithms that are found in the calculation of the low - energy gauge couplings @xcite can be understood as arising from the rg flow of the uv brane kinetic terms , from the planck to the tev scale @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", most models of warped unification seem to require orbifold breaking of the gauge symmetry . thus , to retain the predictivity of these grand unified scenarios ( e.g. for the weinberg angle )",
    ", it is necessary to argue that the bare contributions to the brane kinetic terms are small .",
    "one such argument is furnished by naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) @xcite , which assumes strong coupling at the cut - off scale and demands brane terms to be small .",
    "nevertheless , it should be kept in mind that the ir kinetic terms could be larger than what naive considerations would suggest , and have important effects for the spectrum of lowest lying kk modes .",
    "a further complication comes from the fact that the rs unified model has tev mass kk gauge bosons which can mediate proton decay .",
    "in fact , since the effective cut - off on the ir brane is tev , even non - renormalizable operators can lead to unacceptably short proton lifetimes .",
    "these problems may be alleviated by assuming that the quarks and leptons come from different multiplets , and their partners are projected out by particular boundary conditions .",
    "clearly , this idea can only work if fermions also propagate in the bulk . in principle , fermions propagating in the bulk tend to improve the two phenomenological challenges associated with bulk gauge fields , since these are mostly related to the localization of the fermion fields in the same brane as the higgs field .",
    "however , it has been suggested that bulk fermions do not lead to a dramatic relaxation of these constraints @xcite .",
    "moreover , the bulk fermions induce new contributions to the precision electroweak observables  @xcite , which can only be suppressed if at least some of the third generation fermions are localized close to the infrared brane .    in this article",
    ", we shall analyze all these problems in detail and we shall demonstrate that kk mode masses of the order of several tev can be achieved by assuming either a non - vanishing ir gauge kinetic term for the gauge fields , or a large higgs mass , together with a particular geography of the fermion fields in the extra dimensional bulk . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the model and introduce the question of unification . in section 3",
    "we present a formalism to study the experimental implications in a simple and straightforward way . in section 4",
    ", we analyze the novel effects to precision electroweak observables due to the higgs localization effects and the contribution of the kk tower of gauge bosons and fermions in the bulk . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the fit to the precision electroweak data .",
    "we reserve section 6 for our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the important features of grand unification in rs . while we envision the non - supersymmetric model of ref .",
    "@xcite , our framework is quite general , defined by the low energy theory , and thus we expect our conclusions to hold more generally for the rs unified framework .",
    "the background metric is defined by the line element , [ lineelement ] ds^2 = g_mn dx^m dx^n = e^-2 _ dx^dx^+ dy^2 , where @xmath8 denote the 5-dimensional coordinates , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the gauge bosons are assumed to propagate in the bulk , while the standard model higgs is localized on the ir brane at @xmath12 .",
    "we will also assume that the fermions propagate in the bulk since in this case the question of proton decay can be more naturally addressed , as we discuss below .",
    "an important issue is how the grand unification group is broken to the standard model group . in the higher dimensional context",
    "there are various possibilities .",
    "these include dynamical symmetry breaking through the higgs mechanism ( as in 4-dimensional models ) , as well as intrinsically higher dimensional mechanisms where the gauge symmetry is broken by nontrivial boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "orbifold breaking seems to be a powerfull ingredient in the building of realistic models .",
    "when the symmetry is broken by orbifold boundary conditions , the gut symmetry is not an exact symmetry of the theory since there are special points in spacetime where the symmetry is reduced to a smaller group .",
    "operators living on the special points are generally not gut - symmetric , and can spoil the gut predictions .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to make further assumptions about the size of the localized terms that need not respect the gut symmetry .",
    "one way to proceed is based on nda , which assumes that all couplings get strong at the cut - off scale of the effective 5-dimensional theory .",
    "this provides a well defined framework in which the symmetry violating terms are sufficiently suppressed to be able to discuss unification quantitatively .",
    "let us emphasize that in order to achieve unification in the non - supersymmetric case , relevant threshold corrections at the grand unification scale must be present .",
    "in warped extra dimensions , these corrections arise naturally if the gauge symmetry is broken by bulk higgs vev s  @xcite .",
    "as we will discuss below , for light kk boson masses to be compatible with present phenomenological constraints , the gut symmetry also needs to be broken by orbifold boundary conditions on the ir brane .",
    "thus , in this work , we shall assume that the gut symmetry is broken by a bulk higgs vev , as well as by orbifold boundary conditions on the ir brane .",
    "the dependence of the 3 - 2 - 1 gauge couplings measured by low energy observers ( at energy scales @xmath13 ) on the gut scale in this type of compactifications has been studied in previous articles @xcite , and it was found that , contrary to what happens in flat extra dimensions , the differences between low - energy couplings depend logarithmically on the fundamental scales of the theory and are given by : [ running ] - = ( - ) + ( - ) + + ( _ i -_j ) kl + ( 1 )  . here",
    "the first two terms can be thought of as the `` bare '' values of the localized couplings , while the @xmath14 term arises from loop effects and is identical to the contribution that is found in purely 4-dimensional theories .",
    "the bulk couplings get renormalized in a universal manner and , apart from threshold corrections , cancel in the differences .",
    "the @xmath15 terms correspond to possible threshold corrections arising from the gut breaking vev s of bulk higgs fields , and have the important property of being enhanced by @xmath6 @xcite . finally , the @xmath16 represents further subdominant contributions . the leading , gut violating , logarithmic effects in eq .",
    "( [ running ] ) can be understood as arising from the rg evolution of the uv brane kinetic terms .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , for @xmath17 , [ uvbraneterm ] = + + gut  symmetric  , which exhibits precisely the large logs found in the low - energy calculation .",
    "the precise @xmath18-function coefficients depend on which fields propagate in the bulk and most importantly on whether those fields have a significant overlap with the uv brane . in fact , in the rs scenario the heavy kk modes of all fields are localized towards the ir brane and therefore each kk mode gives only a tiny contribution to the low - energy gauge coupling .",
    "although the sum of all of them can give a contribution as large as the @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ uvbraneterm ] ) , when including the full gut field content the heavy kk modes give a universal contribution that cancels in the differential  running \" .",
    "thus , the difference in the 3 - 2 - 1 low - energy gauge couplings is effectively determined by the zero modes alone .",
    "this is one way to understand the effective four dimensional behavior .",
    "the gauge zero modes always contribute with full strength to @xmath19 since their wavefunctions are flat .",
    "for the fermions , however , it is possible to add a bulk mass term , @xmath20 , whose effect is to control the localization of the zero mode .",
    "when @xmath21 , the zero mode is localized towards the uv brane and fully contributes to the gauge coupling running . however , when @xmath22 the zero mode is exponentially suppressed at the uv brane and effectively decouples from the running above the tev scale . there is also an intermediate region in which the fermions contribute only partially to the renormalization of the gauge coupling",
    ". then , splitting the gauge and fermion contributions , the @xmath18-function coefficients are given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the @xmath26 terms are associated with the fermions .",
    "note that if the fermions come in complete multiplets , then they contribute universally : @xmath27 .",
    "however , we have seen that considerations related to proton decay forces us to split them into different multiplets , which can then have different bulk masses . in practice",
    ", we will assume universal fermion bulk masses and , as a result , the fermions do not have an impact on whether the gauge couplings unify or not .",
    "it is important to emphasize that within the framework of grand unification in warped extra dimensions , there is always a tower of @xmath28 gauge bosons with masses of order @xmath29 , where in general @xmath28 denote the non - standard gauge bosons arising as a remnant of the broken grand unified symmetry .",
    "in fact , this is an essential feature which allows one to express the differences in the zero mode couplings , eq .",
    "( [ running ] ) , in terms of large @xmath14s of only the four dimensional beta functions .",
    "the key point is that the higher kk modes always come in complete gut multiplets ( the heavy kk modes of the broken and unbroken gauge bosons are approximately degenerate in mass ) and do not influence the coupling differences in a large way  @xcite .",
    "however , this remarkable feature , a clear distinction of the rs - style grand unification from the more conventional 4-dimensional unification scenario , is also a potential problem phenomenologically .",
    "if the quarks and leptons are unified in gut multiplets , these gauge bosons will induce proton decay at an unacceptable rate .",
    "one way of avoiding this problem is to invoke boundary conditions that break the gut symmetry , which implies that some of the components within a given multiplet will get tev masses . to accommodate the sm spectrum it is then necessary to double the number of bulk matter multiplets , with the result that quarks and leptons reside in different multiplets .",
    "for example , for an @xmath30 symmetry the zero mode @xmath31 and lepton doublet of a given family arise from _ different _ @xmath32 s .",
    "thus , these models do not have a true unification of sm quarks and leptons . on the other hand the dangerous couplings of broken gauge bosons to pairs of zero mode fermions are absent and can not mediate proton decay .",
    "one still has to worry about higher dimension operators .",
    "for example , if baryon violating operators are present on the ir brane , they will only be suppressed by the tev scale .",
    "thus , it is necessary to forbid such operators up to a very high order .",
    "one possibility is to impose some sort of gauged baryon symmetry , which is broken only on the uv brane @xcite .",
    "all the generated baryon violating operators will then be suppressed by the planck scale .    for the analysis of the electroweak constraints , we will concentrate on an effective theory valid just above the tev scale , and use the previous considerations to motivate certain relations among the effective parameters .",
    "we can then match to an effective 4-dimensional theory and use the well measured low - energy data to fix these parameters .",
    "we are interested in determining the bounds on the effective compactification scale , @xmath33 , in the class of models described in the previous section .",
    "these arise both from deviations from the standard model in the zero - mode sector of the theory , as well as from the effects mediated by the kaluza - klein towers of the various bulk fields .",
    "the former are associated with deformations of the zero - mode wavefunctions due to the electroweak breaking higgs vev , which is localized on the ir brane .",
    "the latter arise from exchange of kk mode gauge bosons or fermions between zero mode fields .",
    "the gauge kk towers induce four - fermion operators that can be important in some regions of parameter space .",
    "since these are tree - level effects , they can potentially impose the strongest constraints on the model .",
    "in addition , due to the large top yukawa coupling , the top kk tower can induce important contributions to the @xmath34 parameter , even though these arise at loop level .",
    "similarly dangerous contributions can arise from the kk modes of the broken gauge bosons .",
    "the simplest way to analyze these effects is to first obtain the effective 4-dimensional theory . in this section ,",
    "we derive the general form of the low - energy theory and determine a region in parameter space where the top loop effects can be neglected .    in order to study the low - energy constraints , as well as the properties of the lowest lying kk modes , we can consider an effective 5-dimensional theory with renormalized parameters at the matching scale @xmath35 . the effective action describing the standard model sector ( i.e. the standard model fields together with their corresponding kk towers ) is then given by [ fullgaugeaction ] s & = & _ 0^d^4x dy \\ { - w_mn^+ w^mn_- - w_mn^3 w^mn_3 .",

    "these couplings can be considerably large if @xmath135 is close to @xmath151 ( but still @xmath158 ) , thus imposing some further constraints on the allowed region of parameter space .",
    "in fact , even if these factors are small enough that we can treat these effects in the mass insertion approximation , there can still be sizable contributions to the @xmath34 parameter due to loops of the top kk modes .",
    "we estimate these contributions in the next section .",
    "as described above , there are two main contributions affecting the precision electroweak observables in this theory . the first type",
    "are the higgs localization effects that are associated with a deformation of the zero - mode weak gauge boson wavefunctions and masses .",
    "these effects are related to the functions @xmath159 and @xmath160 introduced in the previous section . when all fermions have a common value of the bulk mass parameter @xmath135 , these affect the couplings of the gauge bosons to quarks and leptons in a universal way",
    ". they are therefore associated with oblique corrections .",
    "also in this class are loop - level corrections to the gauge boson self - energies due to the kk modes of bulk fields .",
    "the second type of contributions arise from exchange of the kk modes of the gauge bosons at tree - level , leading to non - oblique corrections proportional to the functions @xmath161 introduced in the previous section .",
    "since the higgs localization effects are associated with oblique corrections , their impact on all experimental observables can be described in terms of parameters @xmath162 , @xmath34 and @xmath163 , defined in ref .",
    "these parameters provide an excellent description of all precision electroweak data in the case that the non - oblique corrections , parametrized by @xmath164 , are much smaller than the oblique ones , namely @xmath165 .    whenever the non - oblique corrections are non - negligible , the above procedure can not be applied",
    ". however , there are certain cases in which effective parameters @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 may be defined in order to describe only a subset of the experimental data , which , due to its precision , leads to the most stringent experimental tests on the theory .",
    "this is the case , for instance , whenever the heavy kk modes of the neutral gauge fields are sufficiently heavy , the only impact of non - oblique corrections on @xmath169 and the z - pole observables comes indirectly from the fermi constant @xmath170 . using @xmath170 as an input value to the precision electroweak data ,",
    "the non - oblique corrections induced by the heavy kk modes data can be easily absorbed into the definition of new , effective parameters @xmath167 and @xmath168  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this procedure is that the functional dependence of @xmath169 and the @xmath3-pole observables on the new effective parameters is the same as the functional dependence of these observables on @xmath162 , @xmath34 and @xmath163 in the case in which only oblique corrections are present , and thus , one can use the fits of @xmath162 , @xmath34 , and @xmath163 derived from such observables to understand the physical picture and constraint the parameters of the model .",
    "we start by considering the effects of the heavy kk modes in the theory .",
    "first , due to the large top yukawa coupling , the top kk modes can induce potentially large contributions to the @xmath34 parameter .",
    "in fact , we saw in eq .",
    "( [ topyukawa ] ) that the localized higgs vev induces large mixings between the top - quark left and right zero modes and their even kk towers .",
    "furthermore , the heavy kk modes receive electroweak breaking contributions to their masses that are enhanced by factors of @xmath171 .",
    "the largest contributions to @xmath34 are dominated by graphs with the heavy kk modes running in the loop .",
    "these may be estimated in the mass insertion approximation .",
    "the contribution induced by the mixing of the first kk modes of the left- and right - handed top quark is of order [ deltattop ] t_t^1_l , t^1_r ~()^4 ( ) ^2  , where @xmath172 is the mass of the heaviest of these two kk modes , @xmath173 and @xmath174 were defined in eq .",
    "( [ af ] ) , @xmath175 is the sine of the weak mixing angle , and the term in square brackets is the sm top contribution , which is of order one .",
    "note that , due to the brane localized yukawa interactions and the consequent mixing among kk modes exhibited in eq .",
    "( [ topyukawa ] ) , summing up the kk tower leads to a quadratic sensitivity on the cutoff @xmath176 .",
    "note , however , that in our case the compactification scale is about an order of magnitude higher . ]",
    "this quadratic sensitivity depends strongly on the assumption that the couplings of the heavy kk modes are well described by eq .",
    "( [ topyukawa ] ) .",
    "for example , the presence of ir brane localized kinetic terms for the top and bottom quark fields can suppress the couplings between the higgs and the higher top kk modes @xcite and lead to a milder sensitivity to the cutoff scale . since we expect that the contribution of the lightest kk mode remains approximately unaffected by these effects , eq .",
    "( [ deltattop ] ) provides a lower bound on the total effect of integrating out the heavy kk modes .",
    "an upper bound on the order of magnitude of the contribution of the kk tower on @xmath34 may be obtained by a naive extrapolation of the sum over all kk modes up to the cutoff scale , which at the end of subsection  [ subsec : fermions ] was estimated as @xmath177 .",
    "for @xmath178 it reads @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , this contribution may be strongly suppressed for values of @xmath180 .    however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , when the fermions are localized towards the ir brane , @xmath180 , there are important non - oblique corrections and , in the absence of local gauge kinetic terms the bounds on the kk scale become tight  @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to take the bulk mass parameters of the first and second generation larger than the one associated with the third generation .",
    "however , choosing different bulk masses for the fermions can potentially lead to large fcnc effects  @xcite .",
    "in particular , taking the third generation @xmath129 very different from the first two generation @xmath135 s can lead to dangerous contributions to @xmath181  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to keep non - oblique corrections small , while suppressing the dangerous contributions to the @xmath182 decay width and flavor changing neutral currents we are led to take equal @xmath135 s for the left - handed top and the first two generations of fermions .",
    "the constraints on @xmath50 are much weaker and it is possible to render the above contributions to @xmath34 negligible by taking @xmath150 sufficiently negative .",
    "there are also contributions that are sensitive only to @xmath149 , which are induced by the @xmath183@xmath184 mixing .",
    "the effect of the first kk level is given by [ deltattop2 ] t_t^1_l , t^0_r ~ ( ) ^2  , and , as before , one can estimate the kk contribution to @xmath34 , which scales like @xmath185 , by summing up the effects of the kk modes lighter than @xmath186 . for @xmath187 ,",
    "these type of contributions give @xmath188  @xmath189 .",
    "the kk tower effects computed above can be considered as a conservative estimate of the total contribution to the @xmath34 parameter .",
    "such effects can be rendered small by taking appropriate values of @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "for instance , considering @xmath190 and @xmath191 , and using @xmath192 , these contributions are smaller than about 1/10 of the dominant contribution induced by the oblique corrections to the gauge boson masses and wave functions , that will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "therefore , for @xmath193 , @xmath191 , where @xmath135 stands for the rest of the fermions , the above corrections have a negligible impact on the fit to the experimental data .",
    "let us remark that the effects of the physics above @xmath186 can be parametrized in the effective theory by local operators such as @xmath194 even when the unknown coefficient attains its strong coupling value , @xmath195 , their contribution to @xmath34 is negligible for @xmath187 and @xmath33 above a few tev .",
    "there are possible additional effects induced by the presence of the gut theory .",
    "the kk modes of the heavy @xmath196 and @xmath78 bosons of the theory are essential for the question of unification of couplings , but can also induce important contributions to the precision electroweak observables .",
    "this is due to the fact that these gauge bosons form a doublet under @xmath38 and , if coupled to the higgs , can lead to large contributions to the @xmath34 parameter , because the splitting in masses squared will be of order @xmath98 , while their masses are of order tev .",
    "in fact , if these gauge bosons are even about the ir brane , so that the ir brane respects the gut symmetry , they give a contribution to @xmath34 of order [ deltatxy ] t_xy ~ ( ) ^2  , which is of order one when @xmath197 , the mass of the first kk mode of the gauge bosons @xmath196 and @xmath78 is of order of a few tev . a straightforward way of cancelling these effects is by demanding the @xmath196 and @xmath78 gauge bosons to be odd under the @xmath121 orbifold associated with the ir brane . in this case ,",
    "their couplings to the higgs vanish and these additional contributions to the electroweak precision observables become negligible , because the @xmath28 masses are highly degenerate .      having established that the possible effects from the heavy kk modes of the fermions and the gut sector of the theory can be made negligible , we turn to the effects associated with the zero - mode sector and the non - oblique contributions to @xmath170 . from the expression of the effective action for the charged gauge currents and @xmath169 , eqs .",

    "may be needed in order to avoid large contributions to the @xmath34 parameter induced by kk fermion loops . in order to minimize the contribution of the kk fermion modes to the @xmath34 parameter",
    ", one can proceed with the localization of the third family in the infrared brane , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . alternatively , choosing the value of @xmath248 , while keeping all other fermion bulk mass parameters @xmath249 , is sufficient to suppress the most important loop - induced contributions to the precision electroweak parameters .    in this work , we shall choose @xmath191 , while for all other fermions @xmath250 .",
    "this procedure keeps all light fermions at the same location in the bulk .",
    "this choice of bulk mass parameters @xmath135 has the advantage , compared to the case in which all the third generation fermions are localized on the ir brane , that flavor changing neutral current contributions are suppressed , with the largest fcnc effects in the right - handed up - type sector , inducing a @xmath3-@xmath50-@xmath251 interaction-@xmath252-@xmath253 coupling strength of @xmath254 .",
    "this is well below existing low energy bounds and is too small to affect single top production at the lhc @xcite . ] .",
    "furthermore , large additional contributions to @xmath255 arising from the mismatch of the @xmath3 coupling to bottom quarks compared to other fermions are avoided .",
    "finally , for these values of the parameters , the description of the @xmath3-pole observables and @xmath169 in terms of the oblique parameters @xmath162 , @xmath34 and @xmath163 remains valid , and should be computed by universally taking @xmath250 .",
    "for @xmath250 the value of @xmath160 is much larger than @xmath159 and @xmath199 . from eq .",
    "( [ stu ] ) , and the results presented in figure  [ fig : gfoverg0 ] , one immediately observes that the theory tends to induce relatively large values of the @xmath34 parameter and small contributions to the parameter @xmath162 .",
    "these extra dimensional contributions to @xmath162 and @xmath34 must be combined with the more standard contributions from the higgs . compared to some reference higgs mass @xmath256 ( which must be specified when performing the fit ) ,",
    "the higgs contributions are @xcite , s_h & & ( ) + t_h & & - ( ) + u_h & & 0 .",
    "thus , we observe that the large positive corrections to the @xmath34 parameter from the extra dimensions may be cancelled by the large negative corrections associated with a massive higgs boson in the standard conspiracy scenario familliar when there are weak scale vector - like quarks which mix with top @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that in this case the bounds on the kk gauge boson masses may be relaxed by taking large values of @xmath257 . on the other hand",
    ", a large higgs boson mass also induces positive corrections to the parameter @xmath162 .",
    "however , for @xmath258 , this contribution is also cancelled by the one coming from kk modes , which turns out to be negative and comparable to the one coming from the higgs , for approximately the same values of the kk masses as the ones needed to cancel the @xmath34 contribution .",
    "= 10.0cm=10.0 cm    = 10.0cm=10.0 cm = 10.0cm=10.0 cm    in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated that , in the case of light kk modes , the fit to the precision electroweak data is greatly improved by the presence of brane gauge kinetic terms .",
    "the main reason for this improvement is associated with the fact that for the same values of @xmath1 and @xmath5 , the mass of the first gauge boson kk mode becomes significantly lower for large values of @xmath259 , than in the case of vanishing brane kinetic terms . however , since we are interested in the question of unification of couplings , we can not set @xmath259 to arbitrarily large values . of course , if the @xmath259 are unified , they will not disrupt the unification of the gauge couplings .",
    "however , since we must impose orbifold breaking of the gut symmetry on the ir brane to suppress the contributions from loops of the broken gauge bosons to @xmath34 , there is no reason to expect that the various @xmath259 would be unified , and thus the prediction of unified gauge couplings could be lost .",
    "therefore , we shall only concentrate on small values of @xmath260 , assuming that they are the same for both electroweak gauge fields , and thus do not disrupt unification .",
    "note that even should they not be unified , @xmath226 of order 2 will change the unification conditions by roughly the same order of magnitude as the threshold corrections needed for rs unification anyway .",
    "thus , our results may be taken as indicitive of the picture for small but non - unified ir brane terms as well .",
    "our framework has @xmath261 , and thus we choose to compare the rs model with the lep electroweak working group fit to @xmath162 and @xmath34 which imposes @xmath262 in the fit @xcite . in figures  [ fig : massesc],[fig : massesrir ] we present the results for the upper bound on the first weak gauge boson kk mass @xmath263 as a function of the higgs mass for @xmath250 ( for all fermions except the top right , as explained above ) , and for ( small ) different values of @xmath244 .",
    "as anticipated , the fit to the data is significantly improved by large values of the higgs mass @xmath264 gev , relaxing this constraint . ] . however ,",
    "the bound on the first weak gauge boson kk mode mass is still about 11 tev and therefore difficult to detect at the lhc .",
    "however , even the addition of small kinetic terms in the infrared brane may have dramatic effects in the spectrum .",
    "indeed , in the case of @xmath265 ( @xmath266 ) a bound of about 4  tev ( 5  tev ) may be obtained for values of the higgs mass larger than 400 gev . even in the case of a light higgs boson , @xmath267 gev",
    ", one can accomodate values of the gauge boson kk masses of about 5 tev in a way consistent with precision electroweak data .",
    "observe that even for large values of the higgs mass , of about 1  tev , a good fit to the precision electroweak data can be obtained , due to the simultaneous cancellation of the @xmath34 and @xmath162 contributions coming from the higgs and extra dimensional effects discussed at the end of the last section .",
    "given the above conclusions , it seems possible that the lhc can study the prospect of rs unification .",
    "the electroweak data requires the masses of the first kk gauge bosons to be around 11 tev ( a few tev if the @xmath268 are allowed to be as large as 2 and the higgs mass @xmath269 gev ) .",
    "given that this over - all scale is large compared to @xmath245 , one thus expects quasi - degenerate @xmath270 , @xmath38 , @xmath74 , and @xmath28 gauge bosons . even at 8 tev , it may be possible to see signs of the kk gluons indirectly , e.g. as @xmath271 operators one might search for as a sign of quark compositeness . for masses in the range of a few tev",
    ", there is the hope that the gut sector could be produced and studied , providing clear experimental evidence of an rs unified theory .",
    "warped extra dimensional scenarios have the remarkable property of leading to a logarithmic dependence on the fundamental scale @xmath1 in the difference between the low energy couplings of the model . since the logarithmic dependence is controlled by the 4-dimensional beta functions of the theory , this implies that the question of unification may be studied at a similar level of precision as in the four dimensional case .    in this work we studied a particular realization of these scenarios that is consistent with unification of couplings , and leads to the sm as the low energy effective theory .",
    "while the higgs field is localized in the ir brane , in a way consistent with the randall - sundrum solution to the hierarchy problem , the gauge bosons and the fermions fields propagate in the bulk .",
    "we introduce a formalism that allows to study the main corrections to the precision electroweak data in warped extra dimensions in the case in which the gauge fields propagate in the bulk .",
    "these corrections are parametrized by three set of functions @xmath199 , @xmath229 and @xmath272 , associated with effects induced by the heavy kk modes as well as the gauge boson zero mode wavefunction and mass corrections respectively .",
    "these functions also depend on the localization of the fermions in the bulk .    in the case of bulk fermions which couple to the higgs in a relevant way",
    ", there may be other important loop corrections to the @xmath34 parameter .",
    "these originate from the breakdown of the custodial symmetry associated with the large top - quark yukawa coupling and constrain the right - handed top - quark mass parameter to be negative , @xmath273 , while the value of the left - handed top - quark mass parameter must be smaller than the conformal case value , @xmath274 . in our work",
    "we have chosen values of the fermion mass parameters @xmath135 such that the contributions to flavor changing neutral currents and to @xmath275 are suppressed , while the fermion induced contributions to the precision electroweak observables become subdominant .",
    "the result of our analysis shows that , with small but non - vanishing local brane kinetic terms for the gauge fields , one can obtain a model consistent with unfication of couplings and with precision electroweak data with gauge boson kk masses of the order of a few tev .",
    "the bound on the gauge boson kk masses is correlated with the value of the higgs mass , and a light kk spectrum demands higgs masses larger than 300 gev .",
    "thus , the rs unified framework provides a scenario which is a novel alternative to 4-dimensional susy grand unification , with potentially interesting experimental signatures at the lhc .",
