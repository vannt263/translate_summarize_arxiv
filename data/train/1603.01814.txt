    "<S> * graphene / h - bn has emerged as a model van der waals heterostructure @xcite , and the band structure engineering by the superlattice potential has led to various novel quantum phenomena including the self - similar hofstadter butterfly states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although newly generated second generation dirac cones ( sdcs ) are believed to be crucial for understanding such intriguing phenomena , so far fundamental knowledge of sdcs in such heterostructure , e.g. locations and dispersion of sdcs , the effect of inversion symmetry breaking on the gap opening , still remains highly debated due to the lack of direct experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> here we report first direct experimental results on the dispersion of sdcs in 0@xmath0 aligned graphene / h - bn heterostructure using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> our data reveal unambiguously sdcs at the corners of the superlattice brillouin zone , and at only one of the two superlattice valleys . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , gaps of @xmath1 100 mev and @xmath1 160 mev are observed at the sdcs and the original graphene dirac cone respectively . </S>",
    "<S> our work highlights the important role of a strong inversion symmetry breaking perturbation potential in the physics of graphene / h - bn , and fills critical knowledge gaps in the band structure engineering of dirac fermions by a superlattice potential . *    hexagonal boron nitride ( h - bn ) shares similar honeycomb lattice structure to graphene , yet </S>",
    "<S> its lattice is stretched by 1.8@xmath2 . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the breaking of the inversion symmetry by distinct boron and nitrogen sublattices leads to a large band gap ( 5.97 ev ) in the @xmath3 band , which is in sharp contrast to the gapless dirac cones in graphene . by stacking graphene atop h - bn to form a van der waals heterostructure @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , graphene / h - bn not only exhibits greatly improved properties for device applications , such as reduced ripples , suppressed charge inhomogeneities and higher mobility @xcite , but also provides unique opportunities for band structure engineering of dirac fermions by a periodic potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the superlattice potential induced by the lattice mismatch and crystal orientation can significantly modify the electronic properties of graphene and lead to various novel quantum phenomena , e.g. emergence of second generation dirac cones ( sdcs ) which are crucial for the realization of hofstadter butterfly states under applied magnetic field @xcite , renormalization of the fermi velocity @xcite , gap opening at the dirac point @xcite , topological currents @xcite and gate - dependent pseudospin mixing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , understanding the effects of superlattice potential on the band structure of graphene is crucial for advancing its device applications , and for gaining new knowledge about the fundamental physics of dirac fermions in a periodic potential .    </S>",
    "<S> previously , the existence of sdcs has been deduced from scanning tunneling spectroscopy , resistivity and capacitance measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , such measurements are not capable of mapping out the electronic dispersion with momentum - resolved information , and the lack of direct experimental results has led to ambiguous and even conflicting results about the electronic spectra of sdcs and the existence of gaps . although various theoretical models have been proposed @xcite , the locations and dispersions of sdcs strongly depend on the parameters used to describe the inversion - symmetric and inversion - asymmetric superlattice potential modulation @xcite . different choices of inversion - symmetric perturbation could result in either isolated or overlapping sdcs @xcite , and the locations of sdcs could change from the edges of the superlattice brillouin zone ( sbz ) @xcite to the corners @xcite . the inversion - asymmetric perturbation potential can strongly affect the gap opening at the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> the gap opening in graphene / h - bn is a highly debated issue , with some theoretical and experimental studies arguing for its existence @xcite while others ruling it out @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such knowledge gaps in understanding the fundamental electronic structure of graphene / h - bn call for a careful examination of the electronic structure by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) which can map out the dispersions of original dirac cone and sdcs with both energy- and momentum- resolution and detect the gap opening directly if there is any .    </S>",
    "<S> arpes studies of graphene / h - bn heterostructure had been challenging for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the size of the heterostructure prepared by transferring graphene atop the h - bn substrate was typically a few micrometers ( @xmath4 m ) , much smaller than the typical arpes beam size of 50 - 100 @xmath4 m . secondly , because of the large moir@xmath5 periodicity ( @xmath1 14 nm , 56 times of graphene s lattice constant for 0@xmath0 aligned graphene / h - bn ) , the separation between the original dirac cone of graphene and the cloned dirac cones is extremely small , on the order of the reciprocal superlattice vector @xmath6 0.05 @xmath7 . resolving band dispersions within such a small momentum space requires extremely high quality samples with sharp spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> recently , high quality 0@xmath0 aligned graphene / h - bn heterostructures with large size extending a few hundred @xmath4 m have been successfully grown directly by remote plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( r - pecvd ) @xcite , and this has made our arpes studies possible .        </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure : lattice](a , b ) shows the optical and atomic force microscopic images of a typical graphene / h - bn sample that we have measured @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> palladium ( pd ) or gold ( au ) electrode was deposited to ground the sample in order to avoid charging during arpes measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the height profile shows that graphene exhibits significant out - of - plane height variation @xmath8  . </S>",
    "<S> the moir@xmath5 pattern period is extracted to be @xmath9 nm , which is larger than 14 nm derived from the 1.8% lattice mismatch between graphene and h - bn ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the graphene is stretched by @xmath10 0.2% by the h - bn substrate , and the reduced lattice match leads to an expanded moir@xmath5 pattern . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure : lattice](d ) shows arpes data measured along the @xmath11-k direction . </S>",
    "<S> dispersions from the @xmath3 and @xmath12 bands of both graphene and h - bn are observed , and they overlap in most regions except the @xmath3 band near the k point . here , characteristic linear dispersion from the dirac cone of graphene is observed , while the top of the @xmath3 band from h - bn lies at -2.2 ev , in agreement with the large band gap of h - bn . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of graphene @xmath3 band splitting confirms that the sample is dominated by monolayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> an expected result of the moir@xmath5 potential is the replicas of graphene dirac cone at the same energy while translated by @xmath13 from the graphene k point ( first generation dirac cones , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(e ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the duplicated dirac cones are obvious in both the fermi surface map ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(f ) ) and the dispersion images through the nearest sbz centers ( fig .  1(g - i ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average separation between the original dirac band and its replicas is @xmath14 @xmath15 , which is consistent with the observation of expanded moir@xmath5 pattern .        </S>",
    "<S> we focus on data taken near the sbz to search for signatures of sdcs away from e@xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure : map](a1-a5 ) displays intensity maps taken at constant energies between -200 to -400 mev . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding curvature plots @xcite are used to highlight dispersive bands in arpes data ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b1-b5 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> at -250 mev , a small pocket is visible at the upper right and lower right corners of the sbz ( red dots , labeled as @xmath17 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a1 ) ) , and is especially clear at -350 mev and -400 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the pockets grows when decreasing the energy , which is consistent with conical dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> dispersion images ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(d1-d5 ) ) taken near these corners further support the existence of conical dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> when approaching the second generation dirac points ( sdps ) at @xmath17 ( cuts d1 through d3 ) , the dispersion relations exhibit a rounded m - shape , with the top of these bands moving toward higher energies and reaching -0.21 ev at sdps ( cut d3 ) . after passing the sdps , </S>",
    "<S> the top of the valence bands move to lower energies ( cuts d3 through d5 ) , again in agreement with conical dispersion . we note that around the right corner of sbz ( labeled as @xmath18 ) , no conical dispersion is observed , suggesting that the two superlattice valleys @xmath17 and @xmath18 are inequivalent . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , both the constant energy maps and the dispersion images presented above reveal directly that sdcs exist at the sbz corners and only at one of the two superlattice valleys @xcite , which is in agreement with the landau level degeneracy implied from previous quantum hall effect measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such direct information is critical for determining the parameters used for describing the generic band structure of sdcs @xcite , and for further understanding other experimental results which probe the electronic structure indirectly .        </S>",
    "<S> to better resolve the detailed dispersions of the sdcs , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure : gap1](a ) arpes data taken near the @xmath17 point of the sbz . the conduction bands and valence bands show a rounded w- and m - shape respectively with a large energy separation and a suppression of intensity between them . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the gap opening at the sdcs . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energy distribution curves ( edcs ) are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to peaks from the conduction and valence bands , there are also non - dispersive peaks ( marked by blue ticks ) at the band extrema , suggesting that there are significant impurity scatterings at the gap edges . from the extracted dispersions and the peak separation at the sdc ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure : gap1](g ) ) , the gap at the sdcs is @xmath1 100 mev . </S>",
    "<S> direct observation of gapped sdc around the left corner of the sbz ( equivalent to the two @xmath17 points discussed above ) in the constant energy maps is difficult , since the intensity around this momentum region is dominated by the original graphene dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> however , the intensity suppression in edcs ( figs .  [ </S>",
    "<S> figure : gap1](e , f ) ) from data taken along two high symmetry directions @xmath11-k and @xmath11-m ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure : gap1](b , c ) ) prove its existence with a similar gap ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure : gap1](h , i ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of gapped sdcs at only one of the superlattice valleys @xmath17 suggest that the inversion - asymmetric perturbation potential from the h - bn substrate plays an important role in the electronic structure of graphene / h - bn .        </S>",
    "<S> to check whether there is a gap at the original dirac cone , we dope the graphene / h - bn sample by depositing rubidium to shift the dirac point below e@xmath16 so that it can be measured by arpes . by shifting the dirac point to -0.2 ev , the conduction band becomes detectable . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure : gap2](a1-a5 ) shows a few cuts around the k point of graphene ( see schematic drawing in ( g ) ) . because photoemitted electrons from higher binding energy have lower kinetic energy and smaller in - plane momentum component , the cutting planes are slightly tilted . </S>",
    "<S> the extracted dispersions from momentum distribution curves ( mdcs , b1-b5 ) and edcs ( c1-c5 ) are overplotted as blue dotted and black solid curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a1-a5 ) . figure 4(h ) focuses on the zoom - in dispersions near the dirac point . </S>",
    "<S> the conduction and valence bands obviously do not touch each other when the cutting plane crosses the k point . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is an anambigous signature of an excitation gap . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ figure : gap2](d - f ) shows the data through the k point from sample 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion is consistent with sample 1 while the intensity suppression from the gap at the sdcs is still clearly visible , likely because of the higher sample quality . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 ( i ) summarizes the energy separation between the conduction and valence bands . from the minimum separation at the k point , </S>",
    "<S> the gap is extracted to be @xmath19 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the raw data for multiple samples at all doping levels can be found in the supplementary information .    </S>",
    "<S> the extracted gap size at the original dirac cone from arpes measurements is much large compared to previous measurements , e.g. 15@xmath2030 mev from transport measurements in transferred graphene / h - bn @xcite and @xmath1 40 mev from magneto - optical spectroscopy on similar r - pecvd samples @xcite , as well as theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> here we discuss a few reasons and the implications . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , since the gap is extracted from the band edges in arpes and from the density of states in other measurements , gaps probed by other techniques can be much smaller than by arpes since the density of states rarely drops to zero abruptly at the band edges . </S>",
    "<S> impurities can also contribute to in - gap states and lead to a smaller gap size . </S>",
    "<S> in bilayer graphene , it has been suggested that the gap extracted from transport or stm measurements can be underestimated due to additional conductive channels by defects and charge impurities @xcite , and this may also affect the gap size measured in graphene / h - bn . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , although the maximum gap at the equilibrium layer separation for perfectly lattice matched heterostructure is predicted to be @xmath1 50 mev @xcite , the gap size increases sharply upon reducing the separation between graphene and h - bn layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a band gap opening at the graphene dirac cone and sdcs can be induced by an inversion asymmetric mass term in the perturbation potential @xcite , and the mass term can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the assumptions used @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> shortening of the layer separation between graphene and h - bn by 0.2   around the equilibrium distance can result in almost a threefold increase of the local mass term @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the substantial out - of - plane height variation of 0.6@xmath21 and 0.2@xmath2 in - plane strain revealed by afm measurements suggest large enough variations in the local mass term and can produce a large average gap @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the large gap size suggests that our epitaxial grown graphene / h - bn samples have much stronger short - range interlayer interaction than weak van der waals interaction as commonly believed in ideally flat structures . </S>",
    "<S> although a definitive explanation of the gap opening still requires more theoretical and experimental investigations , our work reports the intriguing electronic structure in a model van der waals heterostructure and highlights the important role of the inversion symmetry breaking perturbation potential and interfacial atomic structure in the physics of graphene / h - bn heterostructure .    * methods *    * sample preparation . </S>",
    "<S> * graphene samples were directly grown on h - bn substrates by the epitaxial method as specified in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as - grown samples were characterized by tapping mode afm ( multimode iiid , veeco instruments ) at room temperature in ambient atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we used freshly cleaved mica as shadow masks for metal electrode deposition . using the micromanipulator mounted on an optical microscope , </S>",
    "<S> the freshly cleaved mica flakes were accurately transferred on the substrates , covering one side of the substrates with most area of target graphene / h - bn samples . </S>",
    "<S> the contact metal ( @xmath1 40 nm pd or au ) was deposited on the non - mica - covered area with a small part of target graphene / h - bn samples . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were then annealed at 200@xmath0c , after removing the mica flakes .    </S>",
    "<S> * arpes measurement . * </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements have been performed using arpes instruments based at the synchrotron - radiation light source at beamline 12.0.1 of the advanced light source at lawrence berkeley national laboratory ( lbnl ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data were recorded by scienta r3000 at bl 12.0.1 with 50 and 60 ev photon energy . </S>",
    "<S> the energy and angle resolution is better than 30 mev and 0.2@xmath0 respectively . before measurement </S>",
    "<S> , the samples were annealed at 200@xmath0c for 2 - 3 hours until clean surfaces were exposed . </S>",
