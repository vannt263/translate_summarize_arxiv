    "<S> the mid - infrared spectral range ( @xmath0 m to @xmath1 m ) is of particular importance for chemistry , biology and physics as many molecules exhibit strong ro - vibrational fingerprints . </S>",
    "<S> frequency combs @xcite - broad spectral bandwidth coherent light sources consisting of equally spaced sharp lines - are creating new opportunities for advanced spectroscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mid - infrared frequency comb sources have recently emerged @xcite but are still facing technological challenges , like achieving high power per comb line and tens of ghz line spacing as required for e.g. direct comb spectroscopy @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a novel approach to create such a frequency comb via four - wave mixing in a continuous - wave pumped ultra - high q crystalline microresonator made of magnesium fluoride . </S>",
    "<S> careful choice of the resonator material and design made it possible to generate a broad comb of narrow lines in the mid - infrared : a vast cascade of about 100 lines spaced by 100 ghz spanning 200  nm ( @xmath2  thz ) at @xmath3 m . with its distinguishing features of compactness , efficient conversion , large mode spacing and high power per comb line </S>",
    "<S> , this novel frequency comb source holds promise for new approaches to molecular spectroscopy even deeper in the mid - infrared .    </S>",
    "<S> due to its scientific and technological significance , laser technology in the mid - infrared is an active area of research and development . </S>",
    "<S> the advent of a compact and versatile coherent light source in this region came after the invention of quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) in 1994 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , qcls are intrinsically difficult to be passively mode - locked @xcite and only active mode - locking has been unequivocally demonstrated creating a limited `` comb '' of ca </S>",
    "<S> . 0.3 thz bandwidth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> today , the most common approach to create frequency combs in the mid - infrared is to frequency down - convert a near - infrared comb through nonlinear processes , such as optical parametric oscillation @xcite or difference frequency generation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> here we demonstrate a novel route to frequency comb generation in the mid - infrared based on ultra high - q crystalline optical microresonators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the particular advantages of microresonator - based frequency combs are the compact form factor , direct fibre optical coupling , high repetition rate and high power per comb line . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been shown that dispersion engineered microresonators enable the generation of spectra that cover more than one full octave @xcite , as required for @xmath4 phase stabilization . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying mechanism is cascaded four - wave mixing ( fwm ) caused by the third - order kerr nonlinearity in high - q whispering - gallery mode ( wgm ) microresonators , which was first demonstrated in silica microtoroids in the near - infrared @xcite . in this energy conserving process , two pump photons ( frequency @xmath5 ) </S>",
    "<S> are annihilated to give rise to a pair of signal and idler photons , whose frequencies are up - shifted ( @xmath6 ) and down - shifted ( @xmath7 ) such that ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process can cascade and thereby lead to the formation of an equidistant optical frequency comb ( `` kerr '' comb ) , whose spectral properties ( offset frequency and mode spacing ) can be stabilized @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several microresonator platforms based on this mechanism have demonstrated kerr frequency comb generation in the near - infrared region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , to move kerr combs into the mid - infrared , one has to carefully consider many material properties such as transparency and dispersion , and most of the existing platforms can not be used in the mid - infrared .     </S>",
    "<S> crystalline whispering - gallery mode microresonator . * ( a ) optical microscope image of the @xmath9-@xmath10 m diameter resonator used in this work , fabricated by polishing and shaping a uv grade @xmath11 cylinder blank ( b ) finite element simulation of the optical intensity profile of a whispering - gallery mode superimposed on a scanning electron microscope image of the resonator at wavelength @xmath12 m . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of curvature of the resonator protrusion , which confines the whispering - gallery mode in the azimuthal direction , is @xmath13 m . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) the figure shows the simulated free spectral range for fundamental modes with mode number m ( @xmath14 , blue curve ) and the difference of the free spectral range between adjacent modes ( @xmath15 , red curve ) as a function of the wavelength for the resonator in ( a ) , exhibiting an anomalous group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) above @xmath16m.,width=302 ]    for mid - infrared frequency comb generation , we developed ultra - high q resonators made of crystalline magnesium fluoride ( @xmath11 ) as shown in figure 1a , b following the approach first introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for choosing @xmath11 is threefold : first , the transparency window of crystalline materials ( such as @xmath17 and @xmath11 ) extends from the uv ( ca . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18  nm ) to the mid - infrared ( ca .  </S>",
    "<S> 7  @xmath10 m ) , enabling to achieve ultra - high q ( @xmath19 ) in the mid - infrared - in stark contrast to fused silica or quartz , which always contain water and suffer from strong absorption above 2.2 @xmath10 m . </S>",
    "<S> second , the ability to generate optical frequency combs via cascaded fwm in the presence of self- and cross - phase modulation of the pump requires the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) in the spectral region of interest to be anomalous @xcite , i.e. a free spectral range ( fsr ) of the cavity that reduces with increasing wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , recent work @xcite shows that a certain minimal amount of anomalous dispersion is critical for the primary oscillating comb modes to be close to the pump thereby achieving low phase noise operation . </S>",
    "<S> we assess the dispersion properties by carrying out fully vectorial finite - element simulations @xcite including material and geometrical effects . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1c shows the dispersion properties of a @xmath9-@xmath10m - diameter @xmath11 crystalline resonator , revealing a gvd that is anomalous over the full mid - infrared transparency range . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion requirement renders other materials , such as @xmath20 microring resonators which are used successfully at shorter wavelength for kerr - comb generation , unfavourable as their gvd is normal in the mid - infrared despite being transparent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> third , the sign of the temperature coefficient of the refractive index @xmath21 and the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath22 are both positive in @xmath11 ( for temperatures close to room temperature ) which allows the cavity mode to be thermally self - locked to the pump laser frequency @xcite and , in principle , enables the stabilization of the repetition rate and offset frequency of microresonator - based frequency combs @xcite . on the contrary , materials with opposite signs of @xmath23 and @xmath22 such as @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> do not allow for thermal self - locking , which results in large thermal oscillatory instabilities and the requirement for active locking scheme ( or injection locking scheme ) .        to fabricate the resonators , single - crystal excimer - grade @xmath11 was first cut into cylinder blanks with several millimetre dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the resonators were then shaped and polished on an air - bearing spindle by diamond abrasives to achieve a smooth protrusion which provides an azimuthal wgm confinement , following the methods described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a scanning electron microscope was used to measure the transverse radius of curvature of the resonator to be @xmath13 m ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting mode area of the wgm was determined in a fully vectorial finite element simulation . </S>",
    "<S> superimposed on figure 1 b is the intensity profile of the fundamental mode at @xmath24 m . from these simulations we obtained an effective mode area @xmath25 and determined the effective nonlinearity of the resonator @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the kerr nonlinearity of @xmath11 ( @xmath28 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diameter of the resonators typically ranges from @xmath29 m to @xmath30  mm , corresponding to a native resonator mode spacing in the range of 10 - 110 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> tapered optical fibres made of silica were used to characterize the optical properties of the resonators at @xmath31  nm . </S>",
    "<S> this method @xcite is particularly suitable as the refractive index of @xmath11 ( @xmath32 ) is close to that of silica , and critical coupling can be achieved . for pre - characterization , </S>",
    "<S> the quality factor of the resonances was measured with a tuneable , narrow - linewidth ( @xmath33khz ) single - mode fibre laser at @xmath34  nm , yielding intrinsic q - factors exceeding @xmath35 , corresponding to an optical cavity finesse of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this quality factor is still far lower than the material limit of the ultra - pure crystalline magnesium fluoride . </S>",
    "<S> additional polishing and cleaning steps of the resonators can reduce the scattering loss and even further increase the q factors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we pumped the resonators by a continuous - wave ( cw ) mid - infrared laser based on an optical parametric oscillator that is tuneable between @xmath37 and @xmath38 m with short term linewidth @xmath39 khz . </S>",
    "<S> details of the laser source and the experimental setup can be found in the methods section and in figure 2a . </S>",
    "<S> optical power levels of @xmath40mw to @xmath41w were coupled into the resonators by employing a tapered fibre made of low - oh fused silica ( @xmath42 at @xmath43 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resonator and tapered fibre are embedded in a dry nitrogen purged environment , as water vapour is highly absorptive in the mid - infrared ( prior exposure to air however does not result in accumulation of water layers as @xmath11 crystals are hydrophobic ) . </S>",
    "<S> the output spectra were recorded by an optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) with cut - off wavelength at @xmath44 m . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2b shows the optical frequency comb spectrum derived from the @xmath45m - diameter resonator pumped with ca . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46mw of laser power at @xmath47 m . we observed more than 100 modes spaced by 107  ghz ( corresponding to a span of over 200  nm ) , which corresponds to the free spectral range of the resonator ( @xmath48 , where r is the cavity radius , c is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath49 is the effective refractive index . due to the high optical finesse ( @xmath50 ) the circulating power in the resonator is approximately @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> as the resonator has a third order nonlinearity , sidebands can be generated once the parametric threshold is exceeded . neglecting cavity dispersion the threshold for parametric oscillation </S>",
    "<S> is reached @xcite when the kerr nonlinearity induced frequency shift @xmath52 equals half the cavity decay rate ( the bi - stability point ) , i.e. when @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the refractive index , @xmath27 the kerr nonlinearity , @xmath55 the power coupled into the resonator , @xmath56 the effective modal area , @xmath57 the cavity finesse , @xmath58 the cavity decay rate and @xmath59 the optical angular frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated threshold for sideband generation is @xmath60  mw , which matches the experimental observation . </S>",
    "<S> the power per comb line ranges from micro - watts up to several milli - watts , significantly higher than the current state - of - the - art down - converted mid - infrared combs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> frequency combs have recently demonstrated potential for advances in molecular spectroscopy @xcite . to demonstrate that the high power per comb line and the wide mode spacing is well suited for the recording of broadband vibrational spectra in the liquid or solid phase </S>",
    "<S> , we performed a proof - of - concept absorption spectroscopy of @xmath61 mm - thick layer of liquid acetone using the comb in figure 2b as light source and recording the attenuated spectra with the osa . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in figure 2c and validated by an independent measurement of the same acetone sample employing a conventional white light source and a fourier transform spectrometer . in future experiments employing a mid - infrared disperser and detector array , we expect microresonator - based combs to be suitable light sources for direct molecular fingerprinting @xcite which would vastly improve the acquisition time and sensitivity . therefore , new opportunities for real - time spectroscopic investigation and optimization of chemical reactions may come into reach , including industrial real - time process control of e.g. pharmaceutical products .        a key requirement of an optical frequency comb is low phase noise . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated the comb phase noise by detecting the beat notes between comb lines and an additional narrow - linewidth cw laser similar to the pump source . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup and results of the beat note measurement are shown in figure 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the comb spectrum ( derived from a @xmath62-mm - diameter resonator ) is shown in figure 3b . </S>",
    "<S> after measuring the beat of the cw laser with the narrow - linewidth pump ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) , the beat notes between the cw laser and different comb modes are recorded ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d , e ) . </S>",
    "<S> all beat notes exhibit the same fwhm corresponding to the employed resolution bandwidth of @xmath63khz . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , neither additional linewidth broadening of the comb modes relative to the pump nor multiple beat notes ( in contrast to measurements on near - infrared crystalline , silicon nitride @xcite and fused quartz @xcite resonators , and in toroids generating broadband spectra @xcite ) are observed in this measurement , indicating that the comb lines exhibit a similar levels of phase noise as the cw pump laser .    </S>",
    "<S> while parametric sidebands can be generated with the pump laser being close to the zero dispersion wavelength , a certain amount of anomalous dispersion is required to achieve low phase noise in kerr combs , due to different possible four - wave mixing pathways as detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for low phase noise operation </S>",
    "<S> it is important to achieve a low ratio of @xmath64 , where @xmath58 denotes the cavity decay rate and @xmath65 the variation of free - spectral range in the anomalous dispersion regime . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous work in crystalline resonators , the present experiments operate in the strongly anomalous dispersion regime . </S>",
    "<S> this can be evidenced in the simulation in figure 1c , which shows that the magnitude of @xmath66 is increasing with wavelength monotonically above ca . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 m in @xmath11 resonators ( anomalous dispersion ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the observation that kerr combs with low phase noise at @xmath12 m can be generated ( while phase noise appears by pumping the same resonators at @xmath67 m ) agrees with the theoretical prediction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , low phase noise kerr combs can therefore be expected across the entire mid - infrared region . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> , the choice of pump wavelength of @xmath68 m originates from the current limitation of the available optical spectrum analyzer and the strongly increasing coupling fibre absorption beyond @xmath44 m . </S>",
    "<S> while the first reason is not a limiting factor of the system itself , the fibre absorption may be circumvented by employing e.g. a coupling prism @xcite or tapered chalcogenide fibres @xcite instead .    </S>",
    "<S> pertaining to the advantages of crystalline microresonator based mid - infrared frequency comb generators , it is noted that the native mode spacing in the range of @xmath69 ghz is a unique feature . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the comb repetition rate and carrier envelope offset frequencies are accessible with fast photodetectors , electronics and digital signal processing ; on the other hand , the comb modes may be individually accessed and even controlled . indeed , a growing number of emerging applications require combs with large line spacing , such as astronomical spectrograph calibration , arbitrary optical waveform synthesis and spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> line - by - line pulse shaping of individual comb lines @xcite may prove beneficial to coherent control of chemical reactions .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> a crystalline microresonator - based optical frequency comb in the mid - infrared `` molecular fingerprint '' region is demonstrated for the first time . the high power per comb line and </S>",
    "<S> the potential to extend the comb to longer wavelengths make it a promising candidate for spectroscopic applications . </S>",
    "<S> future integration of the microresonators with mid - infrared qcls could open the path to novel simple and compact mid - infrared comb generators . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the choice of the microresonator material is not limited to dielectric crystals . </S>",
    "<S> as many semiconductors such as silicon ( si ) , germanium ( ge ) and indium phosphide ( inp ) also exhibit wide transparency windows in the mid - infrared and third - order nonlinearity , a whole class of on - chip molecular spectrometers based on this approach is conceivable . </S>"
