    "previous results of the epos and orange collaborations at the unilac accelerator of gsi have revealed unexpected lines in the sum - energy spectra obtained in heavy - ion collisions at bombarding energies near the coulomb barrier  @xcite .",
    "no viable explanation could be found for these experimental results . at the beginning it was tempting to interpret these lines as being due to the decay of a previously unknown neutral particle with a mass around 1.8 mev / c@xmath2 , a conjecture which was ruled out by subsequent conclusive bhabha - scattering experiments  @xcite . after this time it became clear that internal pair conversion ( ipc ) from excited nuclear transitions , which can in principle lead to narrow lines in the sum - energy spectra , was not sufficiently investigated and also theoretically less well understood , such that some of the reported weak lines might be due to this process .",
    "only very recently , combined experimental and theoretical efforts have provided a better understanding of this fundamental decay channel of excited nuclear transitions in heavy nuclei at rest  @xcite , and the method of how to observe weak lines from a moving emitter was developed systematically .",
    "the motivation of the present work was indeed a search for discrete ipc transitions , excited in heavy - ion collisions at energies close to the coulomb barrier , as possible candidates for previously observed weak -sum - energy lines with cross sections of the order of a few @xmath3b for the system and some tenth of @xmath3b for @xmath4u + @xmath5pb collisions  @xcite . particularly for the last system , two sum - energy lines at ( 575 @xmath6 6 )",
    "kev and at ( 787 @xmath6 8) kev have been observed at a beam energy of 5.9 mev / u  @xcite .",
    "the 787 kev line appeared in both quasielastic central ( r@xmath7 20 fm ) and rather peripheral ( r@xmath8 2026 fm ) collisions , whereas the 575 kev line occurred only in coincidence with central collisions .",
    "both lines were seen without a doppler - shift correction and only in the opening - angle region @xmath9= @xmath10 , for which doppler broadening is expected to be small for similar energies of both leptons .",
    "the underlying energy - difference range was @xmath11100 kev @xmath12 @xmath13 + 34 kev , which also reflects the sweeping procedure of the orange spectrometers .",
    "it is centered around @xmath14 @xmath1140 kev for the above observations .    in order to test the response and sensitivity of our experimental setup to ipc pairs from a moving emitter and to learn the observation methods for weak lines we investigated first a known transition in @xmath15pb populated via coulomb excitation , using a @xmath4u beam and a @xmath15pb target . on the other hand ,",
    "since the number of combined nuclear charge ( z@xmath16174 ) is the same for the collision systems and , the lines seen previously in the latter system  @xcite should also appear in the present experiment , if their origin is closely connected with the strong electromagnetic fields available in the collision .",
    "in addition , the collision system was investigated with the objective to search for ipc sum - energy lines .    here",
    "we report the first results from these improved investigations , being performed at the unilac accelerator of gsi .",
    "a dedicated doppler - shift technique is exploited at the double - orange setup  @xcite , which allows to reveal narrow lines in the corrected sum - energy and @xmath0-ray spectra from a moving emitter in an environment being dominated by continuous spectral distributions . in addition",
    "180@xmath17 observation scenarios and data analysis were also exploited for the observation of narrow lines .",
    "it should be underlined here that the investigations and data analysis of this work are more far reaching with respect to internal pair conversion as possible source of lines than the experimental results reported most recently by the apex collaboration  @xcite at anl and the epos ii  @xcite and orange  @xcite collaborations at gsi , who have presented sum - energy spectra without a doppler - shift correction , and have all failed to observe previously reported narrow lines .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "1 , leptons emitted from a target placed between two toroidal magnetic field spectrometers with their axis parallel to the beam direction were momentum analyzed by the toroidal magnetic field and detected with two arrays of high - resolution si detectors .",
    "the toroidal @xmath18)-field is generated by 60 iron - free coils .",
    "electrons with emission angles @xmath19 and positrons with @xmath20 relative to the beam axis are accepted by the spectrometers .",
    "the lepton detectors consist each of 72 si pin diodes ( chips ) of trapezoidal shape ( base : 24 mm , top : 16 mm , height : 16 mm , thickness : 1 mm ) arranged in a pagoda - like form  @xcite .",
    "each chip is subdivided into three segments .",
    "a pagoda roof consists of six pin diodes , i.e. 18 segments .",
    "one detector array is composed of 12 such roofs .",
    "thus , we get a position sensitive detector with 216 segments read out in a matrix mode . at a given field setting only particles with a certain sign of charge are focused onto the corresponding detector arrays .",
    "thus , a very clean separation of electrons and positrons is achieved .    for further lepton identification the lepton",
    "energy and momentum is determined simultaneously .",
    "the deposited energy is measured by the pin diodes , and the lepton momentum is calculated from the deflection and the field setting .",
    "only events for which the energy - momentum relation is fulfilled are accepted , with the result that the remaining e@xmath21 misidentification is small and can be determined reliably .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig . 2 for the case of the positron identification .",
    "as can be seen a clear signature for the focussed positrons is achieved .",
    "in such a spectrum background processes like scattered electrons and @xmath0 rays as well as positrons backscattered from the detectors result in a broad continuous distribution which can be determined quantitatively . in the case of the electron identification due to the higher electron production probabilities",
    "the corresponding spectrum is practically background - free ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the spectrometer accepts lepton pairs with opening angles , @xmath22 , from 40@xmath17 to @xmath23 in the laboratory system .",
    "this range can be subdivided into 10 bins of width @xmath24 . for reconstruction of the reaction kinematics",
    "both scattered heavy ions are detected by 19 parallel plate avalanche counters ( ppacs ) which accept ions scattered under polar angles of @xmath25 and @xmath26 with a resolution of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the azimuthal - angle resolution of all ( ion and lepton ) detectors is @xmath29 .",
    "+ for the detection of @xmath0 rays we used a high resolution 70%-ge(i ) detector placed at @xmath30 relative to the beam axis at a distance of 40 cm from the target .",
    "an ionization chamber installed at @xmath31 ( not shown in fig .",
    "1 ) measures the energy of scattered particles and thus controls the effective target thickness .",
    "it is also used for current normalization .",
    "extensive measurements carried out with radioactive @xmath32sr and @xmath33bi sources proved that our setup is capable of detecting ipc pairs and of determining their opening - angle distribution from an emitter at rest  @xcite .",
    "the measured fwhm of these sum - energy lines is @xmath3416 kev , consistent with the sum - energy resolution of the lepton detectors .",
    "in the case that the leptons are emitted from a moving source , i.e. from an outgoing ion which moves with a reduced velocity @xmath35 ) , their energy measured in the laboratory is affected by a doppler shift .",
    "the kinetic energy of the leptons in the rest frame of the ion @xmath36 and their corresponding energy @xmath37 in the laboratory system are connected by a lorentz transformation    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 being the relative angle between the lepton and the emitting ion which depends on their polar and azimuthal angles as follows .",
    "@xmath41    the reduced velocities of the outgoing ions after the collision are given below :    @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the mass numbers of the projectile and target ion , respectively , @xmath46 is the heavy - ion scattering angle in the c.m .",
    "system , and @xmath47 is the reduced velocity of the incident ion , with @xmath48 being the bombarding energy per nucleon in units [ mev / u ] .    from the above relations it is obvious that the correction of the energy ( doppler shift ) ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) and its uncertainty ( doppler broadening ) depends mainly on the experimental polar and azimuthal angular determination and resolution of the detected leptons and heavy ions . in our setup , the dominant contribution to the doppler broadening is due to the lepton polar angles which can not be determined within the angular range accepted by the spectrometers , and only weighted mean values of @xmath4955@xmath50 and @xmath49125@xmath50 are used , for the forward and backward spectrometer , respectively .",
    "the response and sensitivity of our setup to reveal narrow lines emitted from a moving ion after applying an event - by - event doppler - shift correction to the measured energies has been carefully investigated by monte carlo simulations . in such calculations",
    "lepton pairs from an ipc transition are generated in the rest frame of the emitting ion with energy distributions taken from theoretical calculations  @xcite and assuming an isotropic opening - angle distribution .",
    "the energies of the leptons are transformed into the laboratory system using the inverse transformation of eq .",
    "the simulated events are then analyzed with the same analysis program used to analyze the experimental data . in a second step , the laboratory energies of the leptons are corrected event by event using eq .",
    "( 1 ) and taking into account the angular resolution of our setup by a monte carlo procedure .    an illustrative example of such calculations",
    "is shown in fig . 3 for the 822 kev ipc ( e1 ) transition in @xmath15pb , populated by coulomb excitation in collisions at a beam energy of 5.93 mev / u .",
    "the solid broad distribution shows the sum - energy spectrum expected in the laboratory system if an emitter velocity of @xmath51 0.04c @xmath11 0.08c is considered , as it is the case for peripheral collisions with @xmath52 .",
    "it is centered around 815 kev and has a fwhm of about 90 kev .",
    "the dashed narrow peak represents the same events after an event - by - event doppler - shift correction is applied to the laboratory energies .",
    "the peak is centered at the expected position ( @xmath34822 kev ) and has a fwhm of @xmath3416 kev .",
    "the latter is mainly due to the uncertainty of the lepton polar angles , discussed above .",
    "for central collisions , a velocity of @xmath51 0.1c for the recoiling ion is expected which leads to sum - energy distributions with widths of about 100 kev in the laboratory system and of nearly 40 kev after doppler - shift correction .",
    "it should be pointed out here that the detection of ipc sum - energy lines in the real experiment is rather difficult because they are produced with weak intensities , superimposed on a continuous spectral distribution ( see below ) mainly caused by pair creation in the time - changing high coulomb field of the high - z collision partners ( dynamic creation ) .",
    "it is particularly difficult to detect ipc lines from projectile - like nuclei in grazing collisions , because the doppler shifts and their resulting corrections are rather large . in such cases",
    "the sensitivity can be improved by restricting the analysis to events with opening angles of about @xmath23 or by eliminating the most peripheral scattering events with r@xmath53 25 fm .",
    "data were taken for the collision system @xmath4u + @xmath15pb using @xmath4u beams and 800 @xmath3g / cm@xmath2 thick @xmath15pb targets mounted on a rotating target wheel . the projectile energy ( 5.93 mev / u ) is slightly below the coulomb barrier ( 6.06 mev / u ) .",
    "the @xmath55-level at 2.65 mev in @xmath15pb is populated via coulomb excitation and deexcites for the most part into the lower lying @xmath56-level with a @xmath0-transition energy of  @xcite .",
    "following an event - by - event doppler - shift correction to the pb - like recoiling ion , a pronounced @xmath0 line with a total excitation cross section of @xmath57 appears at ( 1844 @xmath6 1 ) kev in the measured energy spectrum ( fig .",
    "its fwhm is 22 kev , mainly caused by uncertainties in the doppler - shift correction introduced by the finite angular resolution of the heavy - ion detectors .",
    "the excitation probability , p@xmath58(r@xmath1 ) , was determined as a function of distance of closest approach , r@xmath1 , by normalizing the @xmath0 yield in certain r@xmath1 intervals with the corresponding number of elastically scattered ions .",
    "r@xmath1 was determined from the measured scattering angle @xmath59 assuming rutherford trajectories . at large r@xmath1 values",
    ", p@xmath58 shows an exponential decrease , whereas at small r@xmath1 values p@xmath58 is cut off abruptly at r@xmath60 17 fm , where the nuclei come into contact .",
    "such a behaviour is typical for coulomb excitation ( fig .",
    "the results are in accordance with measurements of the epos collaboration who investigated the same collision system at a bombarding energy of 5.82 mev / u and @xmath34400 @xmath3g / cm@xmath2 thick targets . they reported recently a measured cross section of @xmath57 ( 44 @xmath6 7 ) mb  @xcite .    from the 1844 kev transition we expect ipc pairs with a sum energy of multiplying the measured @xmath0",
    "cross section with the theoretically predicted ipc coefficient of @xmath61 , for an electromagnetic transition with multipolarity e1 , z=82 and 1850 kev energy  @xcite , we expect a total cross section for ipc of @xmath62(22 @xmath6 2 ) @xmath3b . in order to optimize the peak - to - continuum ratio in the e@xmath21e@xmath63-sum - energy spectra , we eliminated large positive energy differences @xmath64e = e@xmath65 e@xmath66 175 kev , and accepted only rather peripheral collisions with r@xmath53 23 fm",
    ". thus , we could reduce the contribution of the continuum pairs produced by the large time - changing coulomb field and combinatorial background from coincidences of @xmath67 electrons emitted in the same collision with positrons .",
    "particularly , negative energy differences ( e@xmath65 e@xmath68 ) select the combination of low e@xmath21 energies and high e@xmath63 energies , thus reducing significantly the contribution of the exponentially increasing @xmath67-electron rate at low energies .",
    "the event - by - event doppler - shift corrected sum - energy spectrum obtained under these conditions is shown in fig .",
    "the spectrum is integrated over the whole range of lepton opening angles covered experimentally .",
    "as shown , the continuous part of the measured spectrum is well reproduced by a reference distribution ( smooth solid curve ) , being gained by an event - mixing procedure .    from the ipc cross section",
    "quoted above , a total of about 35 ipc pairs is then expected in the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "4c , using an ipc detection efficiency of @xmath69 ( 1.6 @xmath6 0.2 ) @xmath70 .",
    "they should result in a line at an energy of @xmath34820 kev with a fwhm of @xmath34 20 kev , superimposed on the continuum .",
    "the ipc detection efficiency has been obtained by a monte carlo simulation , which assumes isotropically emitted e@xmath21e@xmath63 pairs and theoretically - calculated lepton energy distributions for z @xmath71 82 and e1 multipolarity  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that in this case the assumption of isotropically emitted pairs is a good approximation , as shown by the analysis of the measured ipc line .",
    "the sweep for these measurements was performed such that lepton pairs with rather positive energy differences e@xmath65 e@xmath72 200 kev were detected with a maximum efficiency .",
    "the total ipc pair detection efficiency was ( 2.9 @xmath6 0.4 ) @xmath70 for this sweep mode .",
    "the elimination of pairs with energy differences @xmath64e @xmath73 175 kev leads to the reduced detection efficiency quoted above . note also here that previous measurements were differently performed , such that pairs with e@xmath65 e@xmath72 @xmath1140 kev were detected with the maximum efficiency , resulting in a total detection efficiency of 3 @xmath70 and a better signal to continuum ratio for the detection of ipc lines .",
    "the width of the doppler - shift corrected line depends on the emitter velocity and on the angular resolution of the detectors . as pointed out in sect .  3 , for the case of a rather slow emitter ( i.e. , @xmath51 0.05c ) , as obtained from peripheral collisions and looking at the target - like excited nucleus , we expect line widths near the limit given by the detector sum - energy resolution , i.e. , fwhm @xmath34 16 kev  @xcite .",
    "figure 4c shows an excess , relative to the continuous distribution determined by event mixing , of ( 40 @xmath6 12 ) counts in the energy window 805 kev to 825 kev and ( 57 @xmath6 14 ) counts in the energy window between 805 kev and 835 kev .",
    "this corresponds to differential cross sections of ( d@xmath74/d@xmath75 ( 3.1 @xmath6 1.0 ) @xmath3b / sr and ( d@xmath74/d@xmath75 ( 4.4 @xmath6 1.1 ) @xmath3b / sr , respectively , for @xmath76 ( r@xmath77 23 @xmath1132 fm ) .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "it peaks within a narrow r@xmath1 interval , typical for transfer reactions , for which the transfer probability is expected to become large when the nuclei come into contact .",
    "this also means that the excitation function should exhibit a rather narrow structure at energies close to the coulomb barrier with a width of about 0.3 mev / u .",
    "similar narrow structures in the r@xmath1 dependence were observed for a two - neutron transfer reaction , leading to the known 3.71 mev @xmath82 level in @xmath5pb  @xcite .",
    "the line at 1770 kev is assigned to a known m1 transition in @xmath33pb from the @xmath83 ( 2.34 mev ) to @xmath84 ( 0.57 mev ) state  @xcite , populated by neutron transfer from @xmath4u to @xmath15pb , with a total cross section of @xmath57(1.1 @xmath6 0.3 ) mb .",
    "the corresponding ipc production cross section is expected to be @xmath62(0.3 @xmath6 0.1 ) @xmath3b with @xmath85  @xcite , which should lead to a weak -sum - energy line at @xmath34750 kev with a fwhm of @xmath34 40 kev , and an intensity of about 10 counts . in the corresponding doppler - shift",
    "corrected sum - energy spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "6c , no surplus can be found in the energy window between 728 kev and 768 kev and one can not distinguish the appearance of the line from the expected statistical fluctuations , which are of the same order .",

    "this is mainly due to our limited angular resolution for and emission angles , discussed in sect .",
    "3 . the broadening of the lines worsens the peak - to - continuum ratio in the corrected sum - energy spectra , thus making ipc lines of small production yield unobservable .",

    "obviously , our experimental sensitivity has reached the detection limit in this case . in collisions studied in earlier experiments ,",
    "the u - like recoil has a low velocity which allows easier detection of ipc transitions , particularly in 180@xmath17 geometry , without need of doppler - shift corrections , and only negative energy differences were accepted which increases the signal - to - background ratio for ipc transitions .      with the collision system data were taken using a @xmath4u beam at a bombarding energy of 6.3 mev / u ( slightly above the coulomb barrier ) and 1000 @xmath3g / cm@xmath2 thick @xmath91ta targets .",

    "one notes particularly the nearly constant behaviour in the r@xmath1 range between 20 and 25 fm . what is more surprising in this context is the fact that some of the observed @xmath0 lines have energies which could be attributed within 12 kev to known transitions in @xmath93w @xcite .",

    "we should be able to observe the corresponding sum - energy lines after appropriate doppler - shift correction , as shown in the case of the collision system .",
    "however , because the energies of the ipc lines from the strongest @xmath0 transitions are expected at sum energies below 500 kev , their detection efficiency is strongly reduced by our particular choice of the momentum acceptance of both spectrometers .",

    "in contrast to collisions with quasielastic r@xmath1-dependance , which are governed by two - body kinematics , the u - ta collisions , leading to excited nuclear states above 1 mev , show a more complex r@xmath1-dependance accompanied by a loss of events by a factor of 2.5 in the two - body final channel .",
    "therefore we show in fig .",
    "9a only the spectra in coincidence with one scattered ion ( ta - like ) , in order to obtain better statistics . in fig .",
    "9a the energies are corrected for doppler shifts , assuming a ta - like ion as the emitter of the observed pairs . in order to suppress the contribution of the continuum pairs from the strong time - changing coulomb field of both collision partners ,",
    "very positive energy differences between the positrons and electrons were cut out , and we accepted only events which fall in an energy - difference window between @xmath11150 and @xmath98100 kev .",
    "furthermore , only rather peripheral collisions with r@xmath99 22 fm are accepted . in order to reduce the magnitude of doppler shifts to be corrected , the acceptance is restricted to low velocity ta - like recoils .",
    "this ensures a narrow ipc line width and thus improves the signal - to - background ratio . in the sum - energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "9a , a line structure with fwhm @xmath71 30 kev at an energy of ( 558 @xmath6 10 ) kev with a surplus of ( 64 @xmath6 21 ) counts in the energy range between 543 kev and 573 kev appears above the continuum , which is constructed by event mixing .",
    "as already pointed out above , the line shape is well reproduced by a monte carlo simulation shown in fig .",
    "9b . on the basis of the measured @xmath0ray spectrum",
    ", one would expect at an energy of @xmath34560 kev a line structure of about 8 counts only , as expected by an ipc detection efficiency of @xmath100 .",
    "this value was obtained by a monte carlo simulation assuming an isotropic angular distribution and multipolarity e1 .",
    "the 64 counts observed correspond to a differential cross section of ( d@xmath74/d@xmath101 ) @xmath3b / sr in the scattering angle range @xmath102 , which is a factor of 8 larger than expected from the corresponding @xmath0-ray yield .",
    "this discrepancy is surprising and not yet understood . a possible explanation for the high line intensity might be due to an admixture of an e0 to an e2 transition between rotational states of an excited vibrational band to a state with the same spin i @xmath103 2 of the ground state rotational band .    very interesting to note here is the fact that the line at 558 kev appears also in the uncorrected sum - energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "10 , where the opening - angles are restricted to the range @xmath80 and only energy differences @xmath12 100 kev are accepted .",
    "the corresponding r@xmath1 range is 22.4 to 30 fm like in fig .",
    "9a . the line at ( 558 @xmath6 10 ) with a fwhm of ( 20 @xmath6 2 ) kev has an intensity of ( 31 @xmath6 11 ) counts in the energy region between 548 kev and 568 kev above the continuum .",
    "the line position and width are in good accordance with our expectations from monte carlo simulations , but the intensity of the line is nearly a factor of 2 larger than expected from the experimental results in fig .",
    "9a which is also not well understood .    from the collision system",
    "one should also expect ipc pairs from the coulomb - excited 1778 kev transition , discussed at the end of the previous chapter .",
    "but two criteria make this system less favourable for detecting ipc lines : the total cross section of the excited 1778 kev @xmath0 transition is with 2 mb a factor of 3 reduced compared to the cross section obtained from the collision system .",
    "moreover , the pair - detection efficiency at sum - energies around 760 kev is strongly reduced because of a different choice of the momentum acceptance of our spectrometers as compared to the measurements .",
    "in summary , we reported the observation of @xmath0-transitions which could contribute to observable ipc lines in collisions of @xmath4u with @xmath15pb and @xmath91ta nuclei at bombarding energies close to the respective coulomb barrier .",
    "the @xmath0 lines were observed after a doppler - shift correction of the spectra with cross sections of several 10 mb in the case of coulomb excitation and in the order of 1 mb for transfer reactions .",
    "we succeeded also to observe for most of the stronger nuclear transitions weak ipc lines in doppler - shift corrected sum energy spectra with the expected cross sections of typical several @xmath3b , in accordance with theoretically predicted ipc coefficients in the case that the transition multipolarity was known .    the transitions from coulomb excitation",
    "show an expected dependance on the minimum distance of closest approach ( r@xmath1 ) , with a sharp drop of the excitation probabilities at smaller r@xmath1 values , caused by nuclear contact , and an exponential decrease for larger r@xmath1 values .",
    "the nuclear excitation probabilities following transfer reactions at bombarding energies close to the coulomb barrier show a quite different r@xmath1 dependance which is sharply peaked around a typical interaction distance .",
    "this reflects also a very strong threshold energy dependance at the coulomb barrier .",
    "the r@xmath1 dependance of high excitations observed in @xmath4u @xmath98 @xmath91ta collisions is less well understood .",
    "this may reflect a not yet studied behaviour of multi - nucleon transfer reactions at bombarding energies close to the barrier .",
    "some weak sum - energy lines , previously observed in and @xmath4u @xmath98 @xmath5pb collisions by the orange collaboration  @xcite , show characteristics of ipc lines observed in our present work . according to the present experience , they may have well been caused by nuclear transitions accompanied by @xmath0 transitions observable only in high - resolution doppler - shift corrected @xmath0-ray spectra , doppler - shift corrected sum - energy spectra and 180@xmath17 sum - energy spectra , like those presented here .",
    "unfortunately , for the previously investigated collision system @xmath4u @xmath98 @xmath5pb at a bombarding energy of 5.9 mev / u , for which we have observed at selected @xmath23 emission angles , sum - energy lines at 575 kev and 787 kev  @xcite , the corresponding @xmath0ray spectra were measured with a low energy resolution detector  @xcite and thus the observation of weak @xmath0 lines was not possible .",
    "therefore these lines might have been accounted for by ipc transitions because for a @xmath23 observation geometry in the orange setup , the doppler shifts nearly cancel in case of comparable and energies as has been shown in fig .",
    "5b . note also that the 575 kev and 787 kev lines , observed previously in @xmath4u @xmath98 @xmath5pb collisions , were not found in our present investigations of the collision system @xmath4u @xmath98 @xmath15pb .",
    "this clearly means that strong field effects can not be the origin of these lines .",
    "there is still the unresolved problem of @xmath104 monopole transitions in pair spectroscopy . until now no e0 transition in the interesting energy region",
    "could be identified uniquely in @xmath4u induced heavy - ion collisions . recently a search for @xmath104 monopole transitions in collisions at a beam energy of 6.0 mev / u was conducted at gsi using conversion electron spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "a limit of 0.3 mb for the production cross section of a k - conversion line in @xmath91ta at an energy around 1.8 mev is derived .",
    "this cross section limit can be transformed into an upper limit for monopole pair production of @xmath105b , assuming an ipc coefficient of @xmath106 0.03 for @xmath91ta and a transition energy of 1.8 mev .",
    "this limit is unfortunately not sensitive enough to exclude e0 transitions from our measured sum - energy spectra definitely .    the observed sum - energy line centered at an energy of @xmath34558 kev originates actually from several close - lying transitions in the ta - like nucleus with energies between 1500 and 1580 kev , as suggested by the @xmath0-ray spectrum shown in fig .",
    "assuming that the remaining intensity excess of the observed @xmath34558 kev sum - energy line is due to several close - lying e0 transitions , the corresponding k - conversion lines are expected to be spread out over a width of @xmath3480 kev , centered around 1470 kev with a total cross section of ( 0.7 @xmath6 0.2 )  mb .",
    "the cross section limit of 0.3 mb for ta - like nuclei and e@xmath107 1.8 mev given by ditzel et al .",
    "@xcite , however , refers to a line width of 20 kev . even if one assumes that this cross section limit is also valid for e@xmath107 1500 kev , k - conversion lines with a total cross section of @xmath340.7  mb , spread out over an energy range of about 80 kev ,",
    "could not be excluded by the measurements of ditzel et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another open problem remains by considering ipc transitions in @xmath4u , which has been used as a heavy - ion beam in all our previous experiments to study pair creation in heavy collision systems . in collisions",
    "an sum - energy line has been observed at an energy of @xmath34815 kev  @xcite .",
    "for this observation two selection criteria were applied : the line was observed only at emission angles nearly @xmath23 and was enhanced by selecting negative energy differences .",
    "both criteria resemble conspicuously those applied to the spectrum shown in fig",
    ". 5b , and might therefore indicate ipc transitions in @xmath4u or in u - like nuclei .",
    "unfortunately , this collision system was also investigated with the low resolution @xmath0ray detector , which does not allow to reveal weak @xmath0 lines in the measured spectra . on the other hand",
    "we have not observed a corresponding 1835 kev line in the @xmath0-ray spectra after doppler - shift correction to the u - like ions in and collisions studied in this work .",
    "consequently , only a monopole transition in @xmath4u could explain the previous observation in collisions provided that these lines were due to ipc transitions .",
    "the observed 1780 kev @xmath0 line could be the @xmath0 transition from the excited @xmath108 state to the 45 kev @xmath56 excited state of @xmath4u adding up to a @xmath108 excitation energy of about 1825 kev , which could give rise to a 805 kev @xmath108 - @xmath108 monopole transition in close resemblance to the previous observation of a line at about 815 kev in collisions .    finally it should be emphasized that the conjectured possibility of the appearance of weak sum - energy lines due to discrete nuclear transitions has been addressed for the first time in the orange experiments ( see e.g. ref .",
    "extensive monte carlo studies have revealed that ipc transitions from a moving heavy nucleus can lead to narrow lines in the measured sum - energy spectra , even without a doppler - shift correction , when restricting the opening angles to the region around 180@xmath50 ( see fig . 7 in ref .",
    "our failure to identify such weak ipc transitions in the previous experiments is not yet well understood .",
    "it might be due to the limited experimental resolution of the doppler - shift technique , most noticeably in the determination of the azimuthal angles for the leptons and heavy ions ( @xmath109 compared to @xmath29 in the new measurements ) , applied at that time to the measured @xmath0-ray and sum - energy spectra .",
    "for instance , in the case of our previous setup with an overall angular resolution of @xmath110 , the fwhm of the doppler - shift corrected lines is increased by about 10 kev .    in conclusion ,",
    "the main progress of this work is the observation of weak ipc lines together with the accompanying @xmath0 transitions .",
    "furthermore we may state that the weak lines , reported in previous experiments by the orange collaboration  @xcite , could have been caused most likely by weak ipc transitions , selected by the nearly doppler - shift - free @xmath23 measurements of the orange setup and the negative energy differences .",
    "the only exception seems to be the observation of a strong line at @xmath34630 kev found previously in collisions  @xcite which , however , could not be reproduced by our improved experiments  @xcite .                                              *",
