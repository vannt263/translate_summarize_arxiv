    "mcmc algorithms sample @xmath0 by constructing a markov chain admitting @xmath0 as unique invariant distribution .",
    "a canonical example is the the metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite : given the current value @xmath1 of the chain @xmath2 , it consists in proposing a move @xmath3 under a proposal distribution @xmath4 .",
    "this move is then accepted with probability @xmath5 \\eqsp,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 stands for @xmath7 ; otherwise , @xmath8 .",
    "it is known that the efficiency of mcmc methods depends upon the choice of the proposal distribution @xcite .",
    "for example , when sampling multi - modal distributions , a metropolis - hastings algorithm with @xmath4 equal to a gaussian distribution centered in @xmath1 tends to be stuck in one of the modes .",
    "so the convergence of such an algorithm will be slow , and the target distribution will not be correctly approximated unless a huge number of points is sampled .",
    "efficient implementations of mcmc rely on a strong expertise of the user in order to choose a proposal kernel and , more generally , design parameters adapted to the target @xmath0 .",
    "this is the reason why _ adaptive _ and _ interacting _ mcmc methods have been introduced .",
    "adaptive mcmc methods consist in choosing , at each iteration , a transition kernel @xmath9 among a family @xmath10 of kernels with invariant distribution @xmath0 : the conditional distribution of @xmath11 given the past is @xmath12 where the parameter @xmath13 is chosen according to the past values of the chain @xmath14 . from the pioneering adaptive metropolis algorithm of @xcite , many adaptive mcmc have been proposed and successfully applied ( see the survey papers by  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for example ) .",
    "interacting mcmc methods rely on the ( parallel ) construction of a family of processes with distinct stationary distributions ; the key behind these techniques is to allow interactions when sampling these different processes .",
    "at least one of these processes has @xmath0 as stationary distribution .",
    "the stationary distributions of the auxiliary processes are chosen in such a way that they have nice convergence properties , hoping that the process under study will inherit them .",
    "for example , in order to sample multi - modal distributions , a solution is to draw auxiliary processes with target distributions equal - up to the normalizing constant - to tempered versions @xmath15 ,",
    "this solution is the basis of the parallel _ tempering algorithm _",
    "@xcite , where the states of two parallel chains are allowed to swap . following this tempering idea ,",
    "different interacting mcmc algorithms have been proposed and studied so far  @xcite .",
    "the _ equi - energy sampler _ of kou , zhou and wong @xcite is an example of such interacting mcmc algorithms .",
    "@xmath17 processes are sampled in parallel , with target distributions ( proportional to ) @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the first chain @xmath20 is usually a markov chain ; then @xmath21 is built from @xmath22 as follows : with a fixed probability @xmath23 , the current state @xmath24 is allowed to jump onto a past state of the auxiliary chain @xmath25 , and with probability @xmath26 , @xmath24 is obtained using a  local \" mcmc move ( such as a random walk metropolis step or a metropolis - adjusted langevin step ) .",
    "this mechanism includes the computation of an acceptance ratio so that the chain @xmath21 will have @xmath27 as target density .",
    "as the acceptance probability of such a jump could be very low , only jumps toward selected past values of @xmath22 , namely those with an _ energy _",
    "close to that of the current state @xmath24 , are allowed .",
    "this selection step allows higher acceptance rates of the jump , and a faster convergence of the algorithm is expected .",
    "the equi - energy sampler has many design parameters : the interacting probability @xmath23 , the number @xmath17 of parallel chains , the temperatures @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the selection function .",
    "it is known that all of these design parameters play a role on the efficiency of the algorithm . @xcite",
    "suggest some values for all these parameters , designed for practical implementation and based on empirical results on some simple models . @xcite",
    "discuss the choice of the interacting probability @xmath23 in similar contexts ; @xcite discuss the choice of the temperatures @xmath30 of the chains for the parallel tempering algorithm .",
    "recently , an algorithm combining parallel tempering with equi - energy moves have been proposed by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the choice of the energy rings and the selection function , when the jump probability @xmath23 , the number @xmath17 of auxiliary processes and the temperatures are fixed .",
    "we introduce a new algorithm , called _ adaptive equi - energy sampler _ in which the selection function is defined adaptively based on the past history of the sampler .",
    "we also address the convergence properties of this new sampler .",
    "different kinds of convergence of adaptive mcmc methods have been addressed in the literature : convergence of the marginals , the law of large numbers ( lln ) and central limit theorems ( clt ) for additive functionals ( see e.g. @xcite for convergence of the marginals and weak lln of general adaptive mcmc , @xcite or @xcite for lln and clt for adaptive metropolis algorithms , @xcite and @xcite for convergence of the marginals , lln and clt for general adaptive mcmc algorithms - see also the survey paper by @xcite ) .",
    "there are quite few analysis of the convergence of interacting mcmc samplers .",
    "the original proof of the convergence of the equi - energy sampler in @xcite ( resp .",
    "@xcite ) contains a serious gap , mentioned in @xcite ( resp .",
    "@xcite ) . @xcite established a strong lln of a simplified version of the equi - energy sampler , in which the number of levels is set to @xmath31 and the proposal during the interaction step are drawn uniformly at random in the past of the auxiliary process .",
    "finally , fort , moulines and priouret @xcite established the convergence of the marginals and a strong lln for the same simplified version of the equi - energy sampler ( with no selection ) but have removed the limitations on the number of parallel chains .",
    "the paper addresses the convergence of an interacting mcmc sampler in which the proposal are selected from energy rings which are constructed adaptively at each levels .",
    "in this paper , we obtain the convergence of the marginals and a strong lln of a smooth version of the equi - energy sampler and its adaptive variant .",
    "we illustrate our results in several difficult scenarios such as sampling mixture models with ",
    "well - separated \" modes and motif sampling in biological sequences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ presentation ] , we derive our algorithm and set the notations that are used throughout the paper .",

    "the choice of the energy rings is most often a difficult task .",

    "<S> this algorithm runs several chains at different temperatures in parallel , and allow lower - tempered chains to jump to a state from a higher - tempered chain having an energy ` close ' to that of the current state . </S>",
    "<S> a major drawback of this algorithm is that it depends on many design parameters and thus , requires a significant effort to tune these parameters .    in this paper , we introduce an adaptive equi - energy ( aee ) sampler which automates the choice of the selection mecanism when jumping onto a state of the higher - temperature chain . </S>",
    "<S> we prove the ergodicity and a strong law of large numbers for aee , and for the original equi - energy sampler as well . </S>",
