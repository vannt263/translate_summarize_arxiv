    "we consider the inverse problem of reconstructing an inhomogenuous isotropic electrical conductivity @xmath0 in a domain @xmath1 , @xmath2 , from interior knowledge of the magnitude @xmath3 of one current density field and of corresponding boundary data .",
    "most of the existing results on this problem ( see a brief survey of previous work at the end of this introduction ) consider dirichlet boundary conditions . in this paper",
    "we study boundary conditions which model what can actually be measured in practical experiments .",
    "we work with the beautiful complete electrode model ( cem ) originally introduced in @xcite and shown to best describe the physical data : for @xmath4 , let @xmath5 denote the surface electrode of constant impedance @xmath6 through which one injects a net current @xmath7 .",
    "the cem assumes the voltage potential @xmath8 inside and the constant voltages @xmath9 s on the surface of the electrodes distribute according to the boundary value problem @xmath10where @xmath11 is the outer unit normal .",
    "if a solution exists , an integration of over @xmath12 together with and show that @xmath13 is necessary .",
    "physically , the zero sum of the boundary currents account for the absence of sources / sinks of charges .",
    "the constants @xmath9 appearing in represent _ unknown _ voltages on the surface of the electrodes , and the difference from the traces @xmath14 of the interior voltage potential governs the flux of the current through the skin to the electrode .",
    "we refer to the problem , , , and as the _ forward problem_.    under the assumptions that @xmath12 is a lipschitz domain , the conductivity is essentially bounded with real part bounded away from zero , the electrodes @xmath15 are ( relatively ) open connected subsets of @xmath16 whose closure are disjoint , the impedances @xmath6 have positive real part , and the injected currents @xmath7 satisfy , the forward problem has a unique solution @xmath17 up to an additive constant , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we normalize this constant by imposing the electrode voltages @xmath18 to lie in the hyperplane @xmath19 the net input currents @xmath7 , @xmath4 as in , generate a current density field @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the solution of the forward problem .    in this paper we consider the inverse problem of determining @xmath0 , given the magnitude @xmath22 of the current density field inside @xmath12 .",
    "the conductivity @xmath0 is _ unknown _ but assumed real valued and satisfying @xmath23    each electrode @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a known lipschitz domain subset of the boundary .",
    "the surface impedances @xmath6 are assumed real valued . in general",
    "we allow them to be inhomogenous functions on the electrodes satisfying @xmath26 further smoothness conditions will be assumed for some of the results in this paper .",
    "we note that , in practice , interior measurements of all three components of the current density @xmath27 can be obtained from three magnetic resonance scans involving two rotations of the object @xcite .",
    "however recent engineering advances in ultra - low field magnetic resonance may be used to recover @xmath27 without rotating the object @xcite .",
    "we hope that the results presented here may lead to further experimental progress on easier ways to measure directly just the magnitude of the current .",
    "we start by remarking that there is non - uniqueness in the inverse problem stated above , as can be seen in the following example : let @xmath28 be the unit square .",
    "we inject the current @xmath29 through the top electrode @xmath30 of impedance @xmath31 , `` extract '' the current @xmath32 through the bottom electrode @xmath33 of impedance @xmath34 , and measure the magnitude @xmath35 of the current density field in @xmath12 .",
    "then , for every @xmath36\\to [ \\varphi(0),\\varphi(1)]$ ] an increasing lipschitz continuous function , satisfying @xmath37 , the function @xmath38 solves the forward problem , , , and corresponding to a conductivity @xmath39 , yet the magnitudes of the corresponding current densities yield the same interior measurements @xmath40 .    more generally , if @xmath41 is the solution of the forward problem for some @xmath0 , let @xmath42 be any lipschitz - continuous increasing function of one variable , such that @xmath43 whenever @xmath44 , for each @xmath45 , and constants @xmath46 satisfying @xmath47 .",
    "one can easily verify that the function @xmath48solves the forward problem with the conductivity @xmath49while @xmath50 .    for hlder - continuous conductivities , in theorem [ main ]",
    "we prove that , must hold in a neighborhood of any non - critical point .",
    "the following example shows that , need not hold in the whole domain @xmath12 for a single function @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the curvilinear octagon with hyperbolic sides obtained from the unit disc , by carving out the peripheral regions along the branches of the hyperbolas @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the electrodes @xmath55 are defined respectively by each connected component of @xmath56 inside the disc , whereas @xmath57 are defined respectively by the connected components of @xmath58 .",
    "thus defined , all the electrodes have equal length , denoted by @xmath59 .",
    "we assume constant impedances @xmath60 . through @xmath61 and",
    "@xmath62 one inputs the net currents @xmath63 , and extracts @xmath64 through @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in @xmath12 one measures @xmath67 .",
    "it is easy to check that the constant conductivity @xmath68 is a possible solution to the inverse problem , with the corresponding voltage @xmath69 .",
    "however , this is not the only possibility : let @xmath70 and @xmath71 be any two increasing lipschitz continuous functions with @xmath72 in @xmath73 , for some @xmath74 sufficiently small . define a new conductivity by @xmath75 as in the previous examples , one can check that @xmath76 is also a solution of the inverse problem for the same @xmath67 , with corresponding potential @xmath77 equal to @xmath8 on @xmath78 , and equal to @xmath79 on @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "similar to the approach in @xcite , we formulate the inverse problem in terms of a weighted minimum gradient problem . here",
    "we need a functional which is appropriate for the boundary conditions coming from the complete electrode model and is entirely defined in terms of the data in the inverse problem .",
    "to obtain such a functional , we found it necessary to revisit the forward problem and recast it as a minimization problem , see appendix a. we are then able to show that the solution @xmath41 of the forward problem is a global minimizer of the functional @xmath81over @xmath82 , with @xmath83 as in .",
    "using @xmath84 , we found the surprising fact that , given the positions and impedances of the electrodes , knowledge of the magnitude of one current density field and of the corresponding average applied currents ( just one number in the case of two electrodes ! ) is still sufficient to determine the geometry of the connected components of the equipotential sets .",
    "furthermore , we remark that , since we recover the direction @xmath85 ( including orientation ) of the electric field @xmath86 , we also obtain an interesting phase retrieval result : the full current density vector field @xmath87 is recovered from its magnitude @xmath3 , and knowledge of the input currents @xmath7 on the surface electrodes , even though the conductivity is not uniquely determined .",
    "uniqueness of the conductivity can be restored by additional measurement of the voltage potential on a curve @xmath88 connecting the electrodes ; see theorem [ unique_determination ] .",
    "the additional measurement involves only a one dimensional subset of boundary measurements , much less than required in the existing results for the dirichlet problem .    for the unique determination result",
    "we assume that the curve @xmath88 and the set of electrodes satisfy a topological assumption , see .",
    "to illustrate the theoretical results , we propose an iterative algorithm and perform a numerical experiment , see section [ algorithm ] .",
    "similar to the algorithm in @xcite we decrease the functional @xmath84 on a sequence of solutions of forward problems for updated conductivities .",
    "conductivity imaging using the interior knowledge of the magnitude of current densities was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the examples of non - existence and non - uniqueness for the ensuing neumann problem lead the authors of @xcite to consider the magnitudes of two currents . the possibility of conductivity imaging via the magnitude of just one current density field was shown in @xcite via the cauchy problem , and in @xcite via a minimum gradient problem with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "existence and uniqueness of such weighted gradient problems was studied in @xcite .",
    "extensions to the case of inclusions with zero or infinite conductivity were obtained in @xcite . a structural stability result for the minimization problem can be found in @xcite .",
    "reconstruction algorithms based on the minimization problem were proposed in @xcite and @xcite , and based on level set methods in @xcite .",
    "a local hlder- continuous dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath89 ( for unperturbed dirichlet data ) has been recently established in @xcite .",
    "for further references on determining the isotropic conductivity based on measurements of current densities see @xcite , and for some results on anisotropic conductivities see @xcite .",
