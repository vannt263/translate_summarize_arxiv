    "for the study of the galaxy formation in the framework of the structure formation of the universe , it is important to investigate the various properties of galaxies as a function of their mass . unlike color or morphology ,",
    "since the dynamical or stellar mass is relatively unaffected by recent star formation activities or the morphological transformation processes such as interactions or mergers , which increase mass at most factor of two , it can be conveniently used as independent variable for the investigation of the star formation history or the evolution of the morphology distribution of galaxies .",
    "while the dynamical mass is more directly connected to the prediction of the structure formation theory , the stellar mass can be more easily measured using the nir luminosity with optical - nir colors or spectral stellar population indices ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "since the stellar mass of galaxies reflects the past history of star formation , its evolution is closely related to the time when the majority of stars in those galaxies built up .",
    "thus the investigations of the distribution of various properties of galaxies as a function of stellar mass at various epochs help our understanding of the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .    for local universe",
    ", @xcite investigated the stellar mass dependence of the star formation history , sizes , and structural parameter of galaxies with the sloan digital sky survey data , and found that galaxies divide into two distinct families at a stellar mass of 3@xmath22m@xmath5 .",
    "these families are found to have different star formation activities , morphologies , surface mass densities , and so on .    at intermediate redshifts , @xcite estimated the stellar mass of galaxies with @xmath23 in the field of the @xmath24 quasar br 1202 - 0725 using the @xmath25 imaging data .",
    "they found that the distribution of the stellar mass of galaxies at @xmath26 - 0.8 has a median value of @xmath27m@xmath5 , but the blue galaxies with @xmath28 show a narrower and peaky stellar mass distribution at @xmath29m@xmath5 , and the all galaxies with m@xmath30m@xmath5 have @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite derived the stellar mass of @xmath32 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the cfrs and ldss surveys using the optical ",
    "nir photometries , and investigated their relation with morphology or star formation rate .",
    "they found that in the range of @xmath33 , the comoving stellar mass density in irregular galaxies increases rapidly from @xmath34 to @xmath35 , and this is complemented by the modest decrease of the mass density in spheroidal galaxies .",
    "they also pointed out that at @xmath36 , the more massive galaxies tend to have lower specific star formation rate r@xmath37sfr / m@xmath38 .    for galaxies at @xmath17 , @xcite investigated the broad - band optical ",
    "nir sed of lyman break galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the hubble deep field north ( hdf - n ) , and found that their stellar masses are about 1/15 of a present - day l@xmath39 galaxy and that these galaxies are dominated by very young ( @xmath40gyr ) stellar population .",
    "@xcite also investigated the spectral stellar population properties of those galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the hdf - n , using the optical  nir hst imaging data .",
    "they found that the lyman break galaxies with `` l@xmath41 '' uv luminosity have the stellar mass of roughly 1/10 of a present - day l@xmath39 galaxy ( @xmath42m@xmath5 ) , and they are well fitted by the model with population ages that range from 30 myr to 1 gyr .",
    "@xcite estimated the stellar mass of @xmath17 galaxies with @xmath43 using the hdf - s optical ",
    "nir imaging data .",
    "in addition to the star forming galaxies , they found that there are a few red galaxies at @xmath44 , and that the fraction of older objects seems to increase at large stellar mass , although the biases against old / passive objects exist near the detection limit .",
    "@xcite investigated the stellar mass of relatively bright @xmath45 lyman break galaxies at @xmath1 , using @xmath46-bands photometries .",
    "they found that their @xmath47 color distribution is wide - spread , and their uv luminosity ( both dust - corrected and uncorrected ) is uncorrelated with the estimated stellar mass .    on the other hand ,",
    "several studies indicate that the morphological sequence of galaxies seen in the present universe seems to be formed between @xmath48 and @xmath1 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the possible rapid evolution of cosmological stellar mass density at @xmath49 is also reported ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate the evolution of the mass dependence of these properties of galaxies back to such an important epoch for galaxy formation .    in this paper , in order to understand the formation and evolution of field galaxies , we investigate the rest - frame color and morphological distribution of galaxies in the hubble deep field north as a function of stellar mass back to @xmath1 , using the archival hst wfpc2/nicmos data and the very deep subaru / cisco @xmath0-band imaging .",
    "deep @xmath50-to-@xmath51 band images allow us to investigate these properties of galaxies at the rest - frame @xmath52-band toward @xmath1 , and estimate the rest @xmath2 color without extrapolation .",
    "the @xmath2 color is relatively sensitive to the average age of their stars because it covers the wavelength region where the largest features in galaxy continuum spectra at near - uv to optical wavelengths , namely , a 4000 break and/or the balmer discontinuity exist .",
    "the wide wavelength coverage also help us to constrain the stellar mass of galaxies with relatively high accuracy . in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the data reduction and the sample selection , and the way to estimate the stellar mass , rest - frame color , and morphology of our sample .",
    "we investigate the evolution of the rest - frame @xmath2 color and morphological distribution of galaxies as a function of stellar mass in section 3 .",
    "a discussion of these results is presented in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize the results obtained from our analysis .",

    "the hdf - n field was observed at the @xmath0-band with the subaru telescope equipped with the cooled infrared spectrograph and camera for ohs ( cisco , @xcite ) on 2001 april 3 and 4 .",
    "the detector used was a 1024 @xmath7 1024 hgcdte array with a pixel scale of 0.111 arcsec for the optical nasmyth secondary , which provides a field of view of @xmath59 .",
    "a number of dis - registered images with short exposures ( 20 s for each frame ) were taken in a circular dither pattern with a @xmath60 arcsec diameter .",
    "a series of twelve frames were taken at each place and the telescope was then moved to the next position .",
    "the position of each cycle ( 12 @xmath7 10 frames ) was randomly dithered with about @xmath60 arcsec offset .",
    "the total exposure time was 36740 sec , about 10 hours .",
    "the weather condition was stable during the observations , and seeing was between 0.3 and 0.7 arcsec , typically @xmath61 0.5 arcsec .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf software package .",
    "there was a variation in the dark level of cisco , which depends on the sky background level .",
    "at first , we thus performed flat - fielding using the superflat frame for cisco @xmath0-band data @xcite , and measured the background level of each frame .",
    "then , `` sky background @xmath62 dark '' frame for each image was produced from the sample of frames with nearly same background level , and the sky @xmath62 dark subtraction was performed .",
    "further we subtracted the residual background by fitting the frames with 5th - order surface function .",
    "then source detection was done for each frame and the offsets between frames were measured .",
    "these frames were co - registered and combined .",
    "we then performed tentative source detection for this combined frame to make the mask image . using this mask image , we masked objects in each raw frame , and remade `` sky background @xmath62 dark '' frame , which is less affected by the fluctuation due to bright objects than the first version , for each raw frame .",
    "thereafter the same procedures were done to make the second - version combined image . from second - version combined image , the mask image was made again .",
    "three iterations of these procedures were performed to make final combined image .",
    "figure [ hdfcisco ] shows the combined cisco @xmath0-band image of the hdf - n .",
    "the fwhm of the point sources in the final combined image is about 0.55 arcsec .",
    "since the field of view of the final image is about @xmath63 , this @xmath0-band image is not completely covered the whole hdf - n area ( figure [ fovcisco ] ) .",
    "flux calibration to the mauna kea system @xmath51-band was carried out by observing the united kingdon infrared telescope ( ukirt ) faint standard stars @xcite taken before and after the hdf - n observation .",

    "dickinson ; pid 7817 ) .",
    "the complete hdf - n was mosaiced with eight sub fields in the @xmath57 and @xmath58-bands .",
    "we analyzed the calibrated data of these observations downloaded from the archival site of the space telescope science institute .",
    "each sub field was observed through nine dithered pointings , with a net exposure of 12600s in each band , except for a few pointings that could not be used due to a guidance error of hst @xcite .",
    "we combined these data into a single mosaiced image registered to the wfpc2 image of the hdf - n , using the `` drizzling '' method with the @xmath64 @xmath65 package .",
    "for optical data , we analyzed the public `` version 2 '' @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56-band wfpc2 images of hdf - n produced by the stsci team .",
    "these optical and near infrared hst images were convolved with the gaussian kernel to match the cisco @xmath0-band point - spread function for the aperture photometry .",
    "first , we performed source detection in the cisco @xmath0-band image using the sextractor image analysis package @xcite . a detection threshold of @xmath66 mag arcsec@xmath67 , which corresponds to about 1.5 times pixel - to - pixel variation of the background , over 15 connected pixels was used .",
    "we adopted mag_best from sextractor as the total magnitude of each detected object . of the sources extracted by sextractor",
    ", objects located at the edge of wfpc2 frames and those which we identified by eye as noise peaks ( mostly near the bright objects ) were rejected and removed from the final catalog .",

    "we cataloged the objects with @xmath69 ( nearly all objects ) .",
    "to measure their color and sed , we selected the aperture size at which s / n ratio at @xmath0-band is 0.75 times that at the maximum s / n aperture .",
    "this is compromise between the highest s / n and measuring over the total lights of objects .",
    "the minimum aperture size is set to 1.1 arcsec diameter , which is about two times larger than the seeing size of the images , to avoid the seeing effect .",
    "the adopted aperture size was between 1.1 and 2.3 arcsec in diameter , typically @xmath611.5 arcsec ( figure [ ncap ] ) . with these apertures , we performed photometry for all seven @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath0-band images .",
    "the background sky was estimated with the annulus , which has 5 arcsec inner diameter and 1 arcsec width . the aperture position for each object",
    "was fixed in order to measure the colors or broad - band sed at the same physical region of the galaxy .",
    "247 objects were cataloged and their magnitudes were measured .",
    "@xcite compiled the hdf - n galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts known by the time .",
    "we identified the corresponding objects in our @xmath0-selected catalogue by comparing the coordinates of the objects in cohen et al.s catalogue and ours .",
    "a few additional spectroscopic redshifts from the team keck treasury redshift survey @xcite also could be identified in our catalogue . for 103 out of 247 objects , the spectroscopic redshifts from the literature could be used .",
    "cohen et al.s sample was selected mainly by the standard @xmath70 mag , and limited to @xmath71 , except for the lyman break galaxies at @xmath17 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "tkrs has the similar selection criterion with slightly deeper magnitude limit .    for those objects with no spectroscopic redshift , we estimated their redshifts by using the photometric redshift technique with the photometric data of the seven optical ",
    "nir bands mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "we computed the photometric redshifts of those objects using the public code of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the photometric redshift was calculated by @xmath73 minimization , comparing the observed magnitudes with the values expected from a set of model spectral energy distribution .",
    "the free parameters involved in the fitting are the redshift , spectral type ( star formation history ) , age , and color excess ( dust extinction ) .",
    "we chose to use the sed model of bruzual & charlot synthetic library ( galaxev ; @xcite ) and the calzetti extinction law @xcite .",
    "for those objects with spectroscopic redshifts , we also computed the photometric redshifts in order to test the accuracy of the photometric redshift estimate for our filter set .",
    "figure [ testz ] shows a comparison between the spectroscopic redshifts and photometric redshifts for those objects in our catalogue .",
    "the spectroscopic and the photometric redshifts agree well within @xmath74 over a wide redshift range , except for several outliers .",
    "figure [ ncz ] shows the redshift distribution of our @xmath0-band selected galaxies .",
    "we used the spectroscopic redshifts whenever possible , and adopted the photometric redshifts for the remainder .",
    "we excluded those stars that were confirmed by spectroscopy from our sample , and did not perform any further star / galaxy discrimination for fainter objects .",
    "we use galaxies at @xmath75 in the following analysis .",
    "in addition to photometric redshift estimation , using the seven optical  nir bands photometry , we performed the detailed sed fitting to estimate the stellar mass and rest - frame color of our sample . like an above photometric redshift estimation",
    ", we used the galaxev synthetic library as the sed model .",
    "the free parameters involved in the fitting are metallicity , star formation timescale ( see below ) , age , and color excess .",
    "the reason for varying many parameters such as metallicity in this sed fitting procedure is to investigate possible range of the stellar mass of galaxies rather than to determine each free parameter precisely .",
    "we assumed the exponentially decaying star formation rate with time ( sfr @xmath76 ) , and varied the characteristic timescale @xmath77 from 0.01 gyr to 30 gyr as a free parameter .",
    "metallicity is changed from 0.02 solar metallicity to 2.5 solar metallicity .",
    "we assumed the @xcite s initial mass function ( imf ) with upper and lower mass cutoffs m@xmath78m@xmath5 and m@xmath79m@xmath5 , and the calzetti extinction law .",
    "the @xmath73 value for each galaxev template was calculated , and the minimum @xmath73 value for each observed galaxy was found .",
    "galaxev code outputs the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) for each template , and therefore we can estimate the stellar mass of objects from the total absolute magnitude and m / l .",
    "we calculated the ( aperture ) absolute @xmath52-band magnitude m@xmath80 , using the best - fit sed template and the redshift adopted above .",
    "the @xmath50-to-@xmath51 bands photometries allow us to measure the rest - frame @xmath52-band magnitude without extrapolation ( use only interpolation ) for galaxies at @xmath81 .",
    "for the objects only with photometric redshifts , we further varied redshift as a free parameter , and calculated the @xmath73 value for each galaxev template at various redshifts in order to investigate the effect of the photometric redshift uncertainty on the stellar mass estimate .",
    "we performed the conversion from the aperture magnitude to the total absolute magnitude by using the differences between the aperture magnitude and the mag_best value at the observed @xmath51-band .",
    "then the dust - extinction corrected absolute magnitude was used to calculate the stellar mass .",
    "the cosmology of @xmath82 km s@xmath83 mpc@xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 is assumed .    as well as absolute magnitude",
    ", the rest - frame color can be estimated from the best - fit sed template .",
    "for analysis , we use the rest @xmath2 color , which is sensitive to the existence / absence of the largest features in the galaxy continuum spectra at near - uv to optical wavelengths , namely , a 4000    break or the balmer discontinuity .",
    "since these features are sensitive to the average age of stars especially at relatively young stage , we can infer the evolution of the average age of their stars even at the region where the photometric uncertainty is relatively large .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath2 color can be estimated without extrapolation for objects at @xmath81 .",
    "we performed a quantitative morphological classification for the @xmath0-selected galaxies using the hst wfpc2/nicmos images , as described by @xcite .",
    "the classification method used is based on the central concentration index , @xmath86 , and the asymmetry index , @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the bands used for the classification were selected so that the classification was made on the rest - frame @xmath88 to @xmath52-band image for each object ( @xmath56-band for @xmath89 , @xmath57-band for @xmath90 , @xmath58-band for @xmath91 ) , where various morphological studies of local galaxies have been done .",
    "since the @xmath86 and @xmath87 indices depend on the brightness of the object , even if the intrinsic light profiles were identical , we evaluated the morphology by comparing the indices of the observed galaxy with those of a set of simulated artificial ones that have similar photometric parameters as each observed galaxy .",
    "the detail processes of the classification are described in @xcite .",
    "+ although some scatter exists , our quantitative @xmath86/@xmath87 classification is confirmed to correlate well with an eyeball classification by @xcite ( @xcite , figure 8) .",
    "the number of galaxies which are classified into each morphological category is 40 in bulge - dominated , 23 in intermediate , 92 in disk - dominated , 65 in irregular , respectively .",
    "the other 20 objects were can not be classified because of their faintness .",
    "we prefer to use a quantitative morphological classification , because it is not only more objective , but can also take into account the effect of the magnitude / surface brightness bias for classification .",
    "using the very deep @xmath50-to-@xmath51 band images of the hubble deep field north , we can estimate the rest - frame optical properties of galaxies to @xmath92 , and investigate the distribution of the stellar mass , @xmath2 color , morphology .",
    "figure [ ms_z ] shows our estimate of the stellar mass of the sample as a function of redshift .",
    "error bars indicate the range of 90% confidence level , which is estimated from the @xmath73 value at each position in the parameter space in the sed fitting .",
    "circles show the objects with spectroscopic redshifts and squares represent the phot - z sample . for the phot - z sample",
    ", we took account of the uncertainty of the photometric redshift in the error estimate .    because our sample is limited to @xmath69 , only the more massive galaxies tend to be selected at the higher redshift .",
    "while we can sample galaxies to the stellar mass of @xmath93m@xmath5 at @xmath48 , only galaxies with the stellar mass larger than @xmath20m@xmath5 can be detected at @xmath14 .",
    "less massive , higher redshift galaxies have fainter apparent magnitude , and therefore the constraint on the stellar mass of the galaxies tends to be weak .",
    "furthermore , the photometries only at shorter rest - frame wavelength can be used for galaxies at higher redshift , which weakens the constraint on the stellar mass .",
    "for example , the typical 1@xmath94 error of the mass estimate for the galaxies with stellar mass of @xmath95m@xmath5 is @xmath96 dex at @xmath48 , and becomes @xmath97 dex at @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite estimated the stellar mass of h@xmath98-selected galaxies in the hdf - n , using the hst wfpc2/nicmos images and the ground - based @xmath51-band data with irim on the kpno 4 m. our result about the stellar mass distribution is similar with that in dickinson et al . , although the selection and the field of view are slightly different .",

    "these discrepancies may be explained by the following factors which could affect our estimation of the star formation rate and the mass growth rate .",
    "+ so far , several studies of lyman break galaxies at @xmath44 suggested that they are shrouded in some amount of dust , typically e(b - v)@xmath200 with relatively large scatter ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "if we consider such an amount of dust extinction for these low - mass galaxies , the estimated star formation rates could become several times to an order of magnitude larger .",
    "+ several studies also suggested that the star formation in lyman break galaxies is recurrent with relatively short timescale @xcite .",
    "@xcite also pointed out that the h@xmath201 and uv luminosity of star forming galaxies at @xmath48 indicates their star formation occurs in episodic bursts .",
    "since most low - mass galaxies in our sample have rather blue rest @xmath2 color at any redshifts between @xmath13 and @xmath183 as mentioned above , the duty cycle of star formation should have relatively short timescale ( e.g. , @xmath202 - 1gyr ) if we assume those recurrent star formation activities . in this case , the expected stellar mass growth of these galaxies depends on the period of the duty cycle .",
    "therefore , the formation epoch calculated from the stellar mass and the star formation rate at the observed time under the assumption of the constant sfr may not necessarily corresponds to that inferred from the color evolution .    with regard to morphological distribution , while disk - dominated galaxies dominate this low - mass population at @xmath15 , the fraction of irregular galaxies increases at @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath2 color distribution of irregular galaxies at @xmath203 is similar to , or slightly bluer than that of disk - dominated galaxies . if we assume that most of these irregular galaxies are merger origin ( or interactions ) , these processes do not seem to change their colors .",
    "namely , such processes may not ceases the star formation activities in these low - mass galaxies .",
    "third , we found that the correlation between the stellar mass and the rest @xmath2 color of galaxies with m@xmath204m@xmath5 does not show significant evolution between @xmath179 .",
    "these high - mass galaxies have redder color , and earlier type morphology than the low - mass sample . for galaxies at @xmath36",

    "what kind of the galaxy evolution scenario can explain this trend ?",
    "if we consider the pure passive evolution for these galaxies , the @xmath2 color is expected to be bluer at higher redshift with nearly constant stellar mass .",
    "this seems to disagree with our result .",
    "for example , in figure [ ms_uvmodel ] , we show the track of such a model in the rest @xmath2 color vs stellar mass plane , using the single 1gyr burst model with 10@xmath211m@xmath5 at 1gyr old ( dashed line ) . as seen from the model ,",
    "if observed high - mass galaxies follow passive evolution , the correlation between the @xmath2 color and the stellar mass shifts blue - ward with redshift especially at low mass side unless the degree of dust extinction is regulated with the stellar mass and the stellar age . in order to make the relation between the stellar mass and the rest @xmath2 color nearly constant over relatively long timescale , galaxies will have to increase their stellar mass as their stars become older .",
    "furthermore , since the comoving volumes of @xmath111 bin and @xmath112 bin are more than three times larger than that of @xmath110 bin , the number density of galaxies with m@xmath212m@xmath5 seems to decrease between @xmath48 and @xmath1 , although small number statistics prevents the conclusive result .",
    "for relatively bright ( probably massive ) early - type galaxies , several previous studies also found that the number density of these galaxies seems to decrease at @xmath158 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . + the merging without active star formation may be possible solution to increase the stellar mass of these galaxies . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed relation corresponds that the stellar mass increases through mergers from @xmath135m@xmath5 to @xmath213m@xmath5 during the time when the @xmath2 color evolves from @xmath97 to @xmath104 .",
    "for example , in figure [ ms_uvmodel ] , we assume the model where the star formation rate is constant by the time the stellar mass reaches 5@xmath214m@xmath5 , and then star formation rate decreases exponentially with characteristic time scale @xmath2151gyr ( solid line ) .",
    "we consider the case that the period for which star formation rate is constant is 3gyr .",
    "star formation rate is adjusted such that the stellar mass becomes 5@xmath214m@xmath5 at 3gyr old , ( figure [ ms_uvmodel](a ) ) . in the model , after 3gyr old , the star formation rate decreases and the stellar mass does not grow . comparing this ( no merger ) model with the observed correlation between the rest @xmath2 and stellar mass , we found that in order to form the observed correlation , galaxies have to increase their stellar mass after star formation activities decrease at the rate of 23 times per about 2gyr through the processes such as mergers for the assumed star formation history .",
    "using the hst wfpc2/nicmos archival data and very deep subaru / cisco @xmath0-band image of the hubble deep field north , we estimated the stellar mass , the rest @xmath2 color , the morphology at rest - frame optical band of @xmath0-selected galaxies , and investigated the distribution of the rest @xmath2 and morphology as a function of stellar mass back to @xmath1 .",
    "following results were obtained .",
    "* in the rest @xmath2 color vs stellar mass diagram , galaxies can be divided into two populations at m@xmath216m@xmath5 .",
    "galaxies with m@xmath217m@xmath5 have relatively blue rest @xmath2 color and their color does not correlate strongly with stellar mass , while at m@xmath218m@xmath5 , there is the trend that galaxies with higher stellar mass have redder @xmath2 color .",
    "this feature seems to hold back to @xmath14 .",
    "* we could not find the significant evolution of the characteristic stellar mass at which the change of the mass dependence of the rest @xmath2 color occurs , at @xmath219 . *",
    "the @xmath2 color of the low - mass sample become bluer gradually with redshift , from @xmath180 at @xmath181 , to @xmath182 at @xmath14 .",
    "such a color evolution is roughly consistent with that expected from the constant sfr model with a formation redshift of @xmath220 .",
    "* on the other hand , the strong correlation between the rest @xmath2 color and the stellar mass seen in the high - mass sample does not show significant evolution at @xmath179 , although the number density of high - mass galaxies may decrease at @xmath102 .",
    "* at @xmath15 , disk galaxies dominate the low - mass population , while the fraction of early - type morphology is larger in the high - mass population .",
    "although the fraction of irregular galaxies increases , the same trend as @xmath15 is seen at @xmath102 .",
    "* at @xmath17 , although we can only sample the galaxies with m@xmath221m@xmath5 , it is seen that galaxies with higher stellar mass tend to have redder rest @xmath2 color over the mass range of @xmath161@xmath222m@xmath5 .    finally , these results about galaxy evolution are based on the hdf - n data , which is at most 4 arcmin@xmath223 .",
    "the field - to - field variance for such a small volume analysis is inferred to be relatively large .",
    "although the @xmath224 vs @xmath51 color - magnitude diagram of several other fields suggests that the close connection between the star formation activities and the stellar mass found in our analysis could be applied to other general fields as mentioned in section [ chrms ] , the investigation / confirmation by the larger - volume survey is clearly important , especially to reveal the evolution of high - mass galaxies , which are relatively rare and maybe strongly clustering .",
