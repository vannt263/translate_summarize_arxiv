    "the principles of quantum mechanics supplied many interesting applications in the field of information in the last decade , such as quantum computer , quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation , quantum secret sharing , and so on .",
    "the quantum teleportation process allows the two remote parties , the sender alice and the receiver bob , to utilize the nonlocal correlations of the quantum channel , einstin - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) @xcite pair shared initially , to teleport an unknown quantum state @xmath2 ; alice makes a bell - basis measurement on her epr particle and the unknown quantum system @xmath3 , and bob reconstructs the state @xmath4 with a local unitary operation on his epr particle according to the classical information published by alice @xcite .",
    "quantum teleportation has been demonstrated by some groups @xcite since bennett et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the theoretical protocol for teleporting an unknown single qubit in 1993 .",
    "subsequently , the protocols for teleporting an entangled state are proposed with some pure entangled states or maximal multiparticle entangled states @xcite . for example , lu and guo @xcite introduced some ways for teleporting an entangled state @xmath5 with entanglement swapping @xcite by using epr pairs or pure entangled states as the quantum channels in 2000 .",
    "lee proposed a protocol @xcite for teleporting an entangled state @xmath6 with the four - particle greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath7 .",
    "recently , rigolin @xcite showed a way to teleport an arbitrary two - qubit entangled state with a four - particle entangled state @xmath8 and four - particle joint measurements .",
    "quantum secret sharing ( qss ) is an important branch of quantum communication and is used to complete the task of classical secret sharing with the principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "the basic idea of secret sharing @xcite in a simple case ( there are three parties of communication , say alice , bob , and charlie ) is that a secret is divided into two pieces which will be distributed to two parties , respectively , and they can recover the secret if and only if both act in concert .",
    "a pioneering qss scheme was proposed by hillery , buek , and berthiaume @xcite in 1999 by using the three - particle and four - particle entangled ghz states for sharing classical information .",
    "now , there are a lot of works focused on qss in both the theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite aspects . different from classical secret sharing",
    ", qss can be used to sharing both classical and quantum information .",
    "for instance , the qss protocols in refs .",
    "@xcite are used to split a quantum secret .",
    "recently , controlled teleporation for a single - qubit @xmath2 @xcite or m - qubit message @xmath9 @xcite have been studied . in those teleportation protocols ,",
    "the qubits can be regenerated by one of the receivers with the help of the others .",
    "those principles can be used to split a quantum secret in qss @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will present a symmetric protocol for multiparty - controlled teleportation of an arbitrary two - particle entangled state with two ghz states and bell - basis measurements .",
    "it can be used to share a classical information and an entangled quantum secret .",
    "different from the protocols for teleportation of a two - particle entangled state with a ghz state in which the unknown state should be an epr - class entangled state @xcite , i.e. , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ) , the unknown quantum system in this protocol is in an arbitrary two - particle state .",
    "moreover , the receiver is an arbitrary one in the @xmath0 agents via the control of the others in the network .",
    "as the whole quantum source is used to carry the useful quantum information , the efficiency for the qubits approaches the maximal value and the procedure for controlled teleportation is an optimal one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present a way for the symmetric controlled teleportation of an arbitrary two - particle entangled state with two three - particle ghz states .",
    "that is , there is one controller who controls the process of quantum teleportation .",
    "we generalize it to the case with @xmath0 agents in which one is the receiver and the other @xmath1 agents are the controllers in the network in sec .",
    "iii , and discuss the difference between the two cases where the number of controllers is even or odd . in sec .",
    "iv , we apply the method for the controlled teleportation to share classical and quantum information . a brief discussion and summary are given in sec .",
    "an epr pair is in one of the four bell states shown as follows @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the eigenvectors of the operator @xmath16 .",
    "the four unitary operations @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) can transfer each one of the four bell states into another , @xmath19    suppose the unknown two - particle state teleported is @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the three - particle ghz state prepared by alice is @xmath22 with a hadamard ( h ) operation on each particle , @xmath23 the state becomes @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the two eigenvectors of the operator @xmath27 .    .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ fig1 ]    the basic idea of this symmetric controlled teleportation of an arbitrary two - particle entangled state is shown in fig.1 .",
    "suppose that alice wants to send the state @xmath28 to one of the two agents randomly and the receiver can reconstruct the state only when he / she obtains the help of the other agent , i.e. , bob reconstructs it with the control of charlie s , or vice versa . to this end , alice prepares two three - particle ghz states @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and she sends the particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 to charlie , and @xmath34 and @xmath35 to bob .",
    "the state of the composite quantum system composed of the eight particles @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath39 , @xmath33 , and @xmath35 can be written as @xmath40 alice performs bell - basis measurements on the particles @xmath36 and @xmath38 , and @xmath37 and @xmath39 , respectively , and then publishes the outcomes .",
    "if bob wants to reconstruct the state @xmath41 , charlie does the bell - basis measurement on her particles @xmath32 and @xmath33 , or vice versa . without loss of generalization",
    ", we assume that bob will obtain the original state with the help of charlie , shown in fig.1 .",
    "in fact , bob can only get an epr - class entangled state , i.e. , @xmath42 ( @xmath11 and @xmath43 ) , similar to those in refs .",
    "@xcite if alice and charlie perform bell - basis measurements on the composite quantum system @xmath44 directly . for example , if the results of the bell - basis measurements are @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then the particles @xmath34 and @xmath35 are in the state @xmath48 it is just a superposition of the two product states @xmath49 and @xmath50 . fortunately , the case will be changed with just a little of modification . instead of sending the three particles in the state @xmath51 directly , alice transfers it into @xmath52 with a h operation on each particle .",
    "then the joint state of the composite quantum system is transferred to be @xmath53 using the decomposition into bell states , we can get the relation between the measurement results ( i.e. , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) and the final state of the two particles @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath57 , shown in table i.    [ table1 ]",
    ".the relation between the unitary operations and the results @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 in the case that each of alice , bob , and charlie keeps one of the three particles in each ghz state .",
    "@xmath58 is the state of the two particles held by bob after all the bell - basis measurements are done by the sender alice and the controller charlie . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the relation between the final state @xmath59 of bob s particles and the original entangled state @xmath60 is shown in tables iv and v for the cases that the number of controllers is even and odd , respectively .",
    "when the @xmath1 controllers and bob want to reconstruct the classical secret , they collaborate to decode the message with the information published by alice , according to tables iv and v.    the difference between this qss protocol for a classical secret and the symmetric multiparty- controlled teleportation discussed above is that the input states are orthogonal and all the agents take the measurements on their particles in the former .",
    "a piece of quantum information can be an arbitrary state of a quantum system .",
    "for a two - particle quantum state , an arbitrary state can be an entangled state in the general formal shown in eq .",
    "( [ unknownstate ] ) . with the symmetric multiparty - controlled teleportation discussed above , quantum secret sharing for an entangled state",
    "is easily implemented in principle in the same way . moreover , each of the @xmath0 agents can act as the person who will reconstruct the quantum information with the help of the others in the network .",
    "in the symmetric multiparty - controlled teleportation , the second ghz state is prepared along the @xmath36 direction .",
    "it can also be prepared along the @xmath61 direction , like the first ghz state , i.e. , @xmath62 at this time , alice and @xmath63 controllers do the bell - basis measurements directly on their particles , and the last controller , say charlie@xmath64 first takes a h operation on her second particle @xmath65 and then performs the bell - basis measurement on her two particles . similar to the case above , bob can also recover the original entangled state with the unitary operations . as for sharing of a classical secret",
    ", alice can also prepare the two ghz states along the @xmath61 direction , and all the persons in the communication perform bell - basis measurements on their particles without the @xmath66 operation .    in summary",
    ", we present a method for symmetric multiparty - controlled teleportation of an arbitrary two - particle entangled state with two ghz states and bell - basis measurements .",
    "any one in the @xmath0 agents can reconstruct the original entangled state with the help of the other @xmath1 agents in the network and the information published by the sender , alice . to this end alice",
    "prepares two @xmath67-particle ghz states along the @xmath61 direction and the @xmath36 direction , respectively . when the number of the controllers is even , the receiver , say bob , need only perform two local unitary operations on his particles to obtain the original entangled state with the help of the @xmath1 controllers in the network ; otherwise , he has to do a cnot operation on his particles in addition to the local unitary operations .",
    "this method for a symmetric multiparty - controlled teleportation can also be used to share classical information and an arbitrary two - particle state with just a little modification . as the whole quantum source is used to carry the useful quantum information , the efficiency for qubits approaches the maximal value and the procedure for controlled teleportation is an optimal one .",
