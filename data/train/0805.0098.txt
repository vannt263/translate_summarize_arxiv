    "the enhancement of relative ( to u , d quarks ) strange quark production in high energy heavy ion collisions with respect to elementary collisions has been predicted long time ago to be a signature of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation @xcite .",
    "the idea was that chiral symmetry restoration favours strange quark production because of the reduced mass compared to its zero temperature constituent value .",
    "this abundant strangeness production could be observed provided that it survives hadronization , i.e. if the early produced strange quarks coalesce into hadrons without reannihilating .",
    "a specific prediction of such a mechanism is the enhancement of multiply strange particles , especially hyperons .",
    "these phenomena have been indeed observed : the ratio of newly produced strange to u , d quarks ( the so - called wroblewski ratio @xmath0 shows about a factor 2 increase going from elementary to heavy ion collisions , ( see fig .  [ ls ] ) as first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the hyperons shows a clear hyerarchical enhancement in central pb - pb collisions with respect to peripheral pb - pb and p - pb collisions at top sps energy ( @xmath1 gev ) , as observed by the wa97-na57 collaboration @xcite . also , it seems that this ratio increases quickly in heavy ion collisions as a function of centre - of - mass energy going from 1 to few gevs and stay constant thereafter .    .",
    "]    [ ls ]    the big question is what is the origin of this observed strangeness enhancement .",
    "is the original prediction of generation in the plasma and subsequent coalescence still viable ? or , rather , are the excess strange quarks produced essentially at hadronization ? or , finally , is strangeness produced during an intense hadronic re - scattering stage , according to transport models _ ansatz _ ? before trying to answer these questions , it is necessary to address a preliminary very important issue , i.e. whether we have produced a completely equilibrated hadron gas or not . if we have a completely equilibrated hadron gas , strangeness content is completely determined and gives information on freeze - out state , but it is not a probe of earlier stage of the process .",
    "solving this problem may have a considerable impact on our understanding of strangeness production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the main tool to probe the formation of an equilibrated hadron gas are the fits of the measured particle multiplicities or ratios to the statistical model , that is the ideal hadron - resonance gas .",
    "many authors have performed such analyses trying to pinpoint the thermodynamical parameters of the hadron emitting source at the chemical freeze - out and their conclusions are vastly different in this respect .",
    "some @xcite conclude that a completely equilibrated hadron gas has been produced throughout the examined centre - of - mass energy range ( from low ags to rhic ) , others @xcite that this never occurs .",
    "the reason of such a dramatic difference in physical conclusions resides on one hand on data selection and , on the other hand , on parameter choice in fitting procedure .     as a function of centre - of - mass energy in central heavy ion collisions ( from ref .",
    "right panel : @xmath2 as a function of centrality in au - au collisions at @xmath3 gev in central heavy ion collisions @xcite . ]     as a function of centre - of - mass energy in central heavy ion collisions ( from ref .",
    "right panel : @xmath2 as a function of centrality in au - au collisions at @xmath3 gev in central heavy ion collisions @xcite . ]",
    "the conclusion that a completely equilibrated hadron gas is found relies on the use of midrapidity densities as experimental input compared with integrated yields of a single fireball at full hadrochemical equilibrium as theoretical model .",
    "the underlying idea is that , being the qgp fireball expected at midrapidity , its properties can be probed by using midrapidity densities .",
    "however , such an approach requires the existence of a region around midrapidity ( a plateau ) where the thermodynamical parameters do not vary much .",
    "conversely , if the observed particle rapidity distributions are not sufficiently wider than that of a single fireball at the thermal freeze - out temperature , the use of midrapidity densities instead of integrated multiplicities artificially enhances heavier particles which have , in general , narrower rapidity width than lighter particles .",
    "this has two biasing effects : increasing the estimated temperature and enhancing the yield of particles carrying strange quarks which are generally heavier than non - strange ones @xcite so that the strangeness undersaturation parameter @xmath2 turns out to be approximately 1 in these fits and essentially unnecessary",
    ".    in fact , up to sps energies , the rapidity distributions are not wide enough to allow the use of midrapidity densities .",
    "for instance , the pion rapidity distribution at @xmath1 gev has a dispersion width of 1.3 , while that of a single fireball at rest with @xmath4 mev ( the thermal freeze - out temperature ) is about 0.8 , hence not much smaller .",
    "conversely , the measured width at rhic at @xmath3 gev is 2.1 , which is reasonably larger than 0.8 .",
    "thus , the use of midrapidity densities allows to determine the thermodynamical parameters of the average fireball at midrapidity at rhic energies onwards ( roughly from 100 gev ) , but not at sps and lower energies .",
    "therein , fits to full phase space yields provide a more appropriate , though amendable , estimate of the chemical freeze - out parameters . for recent studies including rapidity- dependent chemical potentials see refs .",
    "@xcite .    as a consequence",
    ", a strangeness undersaturation parameter @xmath5 is needed to describe particle multiplicities in central heavy ion collisions .",
    "this parameter shows an increasing trend from ags to rhic , where it attains its maximal value 1 ( see fig .",
    "moreover , a @xmath6 is also needed in peripheral collisions at rhic for midrapidity densities , as shown in fig .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the observed strangeness undersaturation ( i.e. @xmath5 ) at energies lower than sps is owing to the so - called canonical suppression effect .",
    "namely , strange particles are further suppressed in pp collisions and peripheral relativistic heavy ion collisions with respect to their expected yield in a grand - canonical ensemble ( or thermodynamic limit ) because strangeness is exactly vanishing within a small volume , called strangeness correlation volume ( scv ) , not necessarily coinciding with the global volume .",
    "therefore , going from pp collisions to central heavy ion collisions through peripheral ones , one expects to observe a relative enhancement of strange particles due to approaching the thermodynamic limit , which is hyerarchical : @xmath7 yield increases faster than @xmath8 which increases faster than @xmath9 s or kaons . yet , although this hyerarchy of enhancements is observed ( see fig .",
    "[ phi ] ) , neither sps nor rhic have observed the saturation which should be there if the scv attains a sufficiently large value .",
    "in fact , this means that the scv only reaches its saturation value ( the one sufficient for the system to be essentially grand - canonical ) at rhic precisely in central collisions , where @xmath10 .",
    "this would be quite a striking coincidence .",
    "therefore , we think that canonical suppression is quite an unnatural explanation of the data , as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the best probe to investigate the phenomenon of strangeness undersaturation is indeed the @xmath11 meson .",
    "this is not an open strange particle , thus it is not canonically suppressed , yet , being a @xmath12 state , it must be @xmath13 suppressed .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 meson has almost no feeding from heavier light - flavoured species and its production is entirely direct .",
    "it was pointed out quite early @xcite that a statistical model with canonical suppression mechanism , i.e. with scv as additional parameter , would have not been able to explain the deviation of the @xmath11 meson yield from its grand - canonical value and this has been demonstrated in fits to na49 multiplicities @xcite .",
    "recently , the star collaboration has measured the midrapidity densities of @xmath11 meson very accurately and the observed pattern as a function of centrality clearly shows ( see fig .",
    "[ phi ] ) that these do not scale linearly with the number of participants , rather the ratio to pp value increases rapidly at very peripheral collisions slowly saturating thereafter .",
    "this non - linear increase can not be attributed to a variation of the chemical freeze - out temperature because this is astonishingly constant as a function of @xmath14 as shown in fig .",
    "[ temp ] and proves that a genuine extra suppression related to the strange quark is needed , as also reflected in the @xmath2 fitted value ( see fig .",
    "[ gs ] ) .",
    "gev @xcite . ]",
    "can we explain @xmath2 in relativistic heavy ion collisions in more fundamantal terms ?",
    "some years ago @xcite r. stock proposed that @xmath15 in global fits could be the effect of superposing a completely equilibrated hadron gas ( @xmath16 ) originated from the core of the nuclear collision ( i.e. the hadronization of the plasma ) to a corona of single nn collisions where particle readily escape the interaction region . since strangeness is largely suppressed in nn collisions with respect to the grand - canonical value while the temperature is almost the same as we know from pp statistical model analysis @xcite , if the number of such single nn collisions accounts for a significant fraction of total particle production , a global fit to one hadron - resonance gas would actually find @xmath2 significantly less than 1",
    "indeed , this idea proved to be able to satisfactorily reproduce particle multiplicities in central c - c , si - si and pb - pb collisions at top sps energy .    ) . ]",
    "[ ns ]    this core - corona superposition mechanism has been invoked by bozek few years ago @xcite to reproduce the @xmath17 ratio as a function of centrality in au - au collisions and has been recently advocated in a paper by werner @xcite to be capable of explaining some more otherwise  mysterious \" effects .",
    "a sharp superposition of a completely equilibrated hadron gas with nn collisions is indeed a zero - order approximation as the actual process is certainly more complex with those two extremes continuously linked through intermediate steps and indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite a more general concept of corona has been used , defined as a  dilute \" peripheral region distinguished from the  dense \" region in the core . yet",
    ", this simple superposition scheme can be a very useful one to understand the physics of particle production .",
    "accordingly , the rapidity density at midrapidity of any particle species is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mean number of single nn collisions , @xmath20 is the initial volume of the initial nuclear overlapping region , @xmath21 is its thin outer shell where these single nn collisions occur , @xmath22 is the growth factor ( i.e. how much this volume expands up to chemical freeze - out ) and @xmath23 is the particle density per unit rapidity in the core relevant to a completely equilibrated hadron gas , i.e. with @xmath16 . dividing by the number of wounded nucleons @xmath24 and the rapidity density in pp , we obtain a simple expression from ( [ phi1 ] ) : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is an unknown constant .",
    "this expression fulfills the constraint that both the left and right hand side ought to be @xmath27 when @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "remarkably , for the @xmath11 meson the constant @xmath26 is independent of @xmath24 because @xmath30 is in fact independent of centrality ( see fig .  [ temp ] ) and @xmath11 does not suffer possible canonical suppression .",
    "indeed , @xmath26 is the asymptotic value of the normalized yield , when the number of participants becomes very large ; hence , it is normally larger than 1/2 and the second term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ phi2 ] ) is negative .",
    "the problem now is how to define and estimate the number @xmath19 of single nn collisions .",
    "ideally , we would like them to be those independent collisions where produced particles do not reinteract at all with the surrounding environment . in perfectly central collisions",
    ", they supposedly are single nn collisions where both nucleons undergo exactly one collision occurring at the edge of the overlap region . on the other hand , in extreme peripheral nuclear collisions",
    ", they should reduce to one nn collision . in all other cases ,",
    "they are tightly related to the nn collisions occurring at the edge of the overlap region where only one nucleon from either nucleus is involved , but their number can not be defined in a clearcut way without a full dynamical model of the collision . however , we can resort to a definition interpolating the perfectly central and the extreme peripheral case and relying on the glauber model .",
    "such a definition might be : @xmath31\\ ] ] where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the number of nucleons colliding once according to the glauber model .",
    "we estimated the thus defined @xmath19 as a function of centrality by means of a glauber monte - carlo calculation .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 ratio can be reasonably fitted for @xmath35 by ( see fig .",
    "[ ns ] ) : @xmath36 plugging ( [ glauber ] ) into ( [ phi2 ] ) we have an expression of the normalized yield as a function of the number of wounded nucleons , that is centrality , depending on one unknown parameter @xmath26 .",
    "this can be determined by matching the model to the measured value in the most central bin and then the centrality evolution is completely determined .",
    "the obtained curve is in impressive agreement with the data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phi ] ; the formula matches the experimental points to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "this is a clear evidence that the envisaged core - corona superposition is able to account for the strangeness undersaturation phenomenon .",
    "( left panel ) and hyperons ( right panel ) rapidity density per wounded nucleon as a function of participants normalized to pp collisions .",

    "( left panel ) and hyperons ( right panel ) rapidity density per wounded nucleon as a function of participants normalized to pp collisions .",
    "data points from star @xcite ; solid lines are the predictions from core - corona superposition ( see text ) . ]",
    "the same exercise can be repeated for open strange particles , the result being shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the curves match the data in the most central bins , while they overestimate the measured points in most peripheral bins : this is likely due to the canonical suppression effect in the core which is not taken into account in the formula ( [ phi2 ] ) but should indeed show up for peripheral collisions .",
    "finally , we observe that other definitions of @xmath19 are possible ( e.g. @xmath37 ) but they lead to similar results .",
    "if our interpretation of @xmath11 production as a function of centrality is correct , several remarkable consequences are implied .",
    "first of all , the enhancement of relative strange particle production going from peripheral to central collisions is mainly due to a geometrical effect of core - corona superposition .",
    "canonical suppression plays a role only in the most peripheral collisions and it is possible that the scv simply coincides with the core volume , what would be a nice fact itself .",
    "secondly , the @xmath11 data supports evidence for a completely equilibrated hadron gas in the core throughout all centralities at rhic , whose temperature is constant and equal to 165 mev .",
    "the same conclusion is likely to apply to sps too .",
    "the fact that there @xmath38 in central collisions @xcite , significantly lower than at rhic , is related to the lower weight of the core compared to the corona . indeed , as energy decreases , so does the freeze - out volume of the core and the multiplicity of particles stemming from it , while the the number of single nn collisions decreases only slightly , the nn cross section being slowly varying .",
    "this would nicely explain the mild increase of @xmath2 as a function of centre - of- mass energy ( see fig .",
    "[ gs ] ) , nevertheless a complete reanalysis of the data is compelling .",
    "as has been mentioned , early analyses of central collisions at top sps energy based on this picture were fairly succesful @xcite , but peripheral collisions are indespensable to confirm this idea . in this respect , na49 is going to update preliminary measurements @xcite which were used to determine @xmath2 in peripheral pb - pb collisions @xcite .",
    "the constancy of @xmath30 as a function of centrality ( see fig .  [ temp ] ) which was first observed by the star collaboration @xcite is confirmed in our analysis of rhic data @xcite to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "this stunning independence of centrality is hard to reconcile with collisional thermalization , as pointed out in ref .  @xcite as it would require a dramatic dependence of hadronic reaction rates on temperature .",
    "also , the @xmath7 yield is very difficult to reproduce in such an approach @xcite unless invoking the existing of massive resonant degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we are greatly indebted with h. caines and j. h. chen for providing us with preliminary star measurements of particle production in peripheral au - au collisions .",
    "we warmly thank star collaboration for allowing us to use this data .",
