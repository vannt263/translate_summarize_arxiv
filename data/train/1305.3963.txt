    "however , figure [ fig : nmr ] indicates that there is a correlation between the absolute values of @xmath94 and @xmath102 , and they group together in certain sets of molecules , i.e. those which contain no hydrogen , those which contain fluorine and hydrogen and the remaining three containing hydrogen but no fluorine .",
    "we observe the strongest pv energy difference for nwhcli , but we mention here that the results could be quite sensitive to the dft approximation applied.@xcite nevertheless , the order of magnitude of the pv energy differences @xmath102 is comparable to those reported for pbhbrclf,@xcite and as expected much larger compared to the chiral polyhalomethanes ( chxyz)@xcite or polyhalocubanes,@xcite if one omits the hypothetical astatine derivative chatfi .    w nmr frequency splitting @xmath94 against the pv energy difference @xmath105 ( absolute values only ) ]    in the first series of compounds containing no hydrogen and showing rather small pv effects , the relative ordering of the absolute values of the pv frequency splittings @xmath94 and energy differences @xmath102 is the same , i.e. @xmath106 . here , the most significant effect seems to be an order of magnitude increase in @xmath102 and an even stronger increase in @xmath94 upon introducing fluorine as a ligand .",
    "the large impact of fluorine substitution is most probably due to its large electronegativity which seems to cause a stronger `` chiral field '' around the tungsten atom . for pv energy shifts",
    "this has been observed before.@xcite the paramagnetic and spin - orbit coupling contributions to the frequency splitting , are of opposite sign , with the negative spin - orbit coupling contribution being larger by an order of magnitude with respect to the paramagnetic one in compounds * 1 * , * 3 * and * 2 * and of roughly the same size in * 4*. the total frequency splitting is thus negative for compounds * 1 * , * 3 * and * 2 * and positive for compound * 4 * , where the spin - orbit coupling paramagnetic contributions almost cancel each other out .    in the second and third",
    "set of compounds , molecules * 5 * to * 10 * , which show large pv frequency splittings compared to the first set , the relative ordering of the absolute values of the pv nmr frequency splittings is @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "if we regard them as two distinct sets as shown in figure [ fig : nmr ] , the same is true for the pv energy differences . for both properties , however , the three molecules containing iodine display larger absolute values than the other three , and nwhfi shows the largest absolute value with @xmath109hz",
    "this comes also from the fact that the paramagnetic and spin - orbit coupling contributions to the pv frequency splitting are of the same sign for molecules of the second and third set , which enhances the increase in frequency splittings .",
    "all of the predicted @xmath90w pv nmr frequency splittings for members of the second and third series of molecules , * 5 * to * 10 * , are significantly larger than the values predicted for molecules * 1 * to * 4 * , and substituting any of the halogens in the first series by hydrogen almost always leads to at least an order of magnitude increase in the pv nmr frequency splittings .",
    "the only exception to this is the substitution of iodine by hydrogen in nwclfi , where there is an increase by a factor 4 `` only '' .",
    "a possible reason for this trend is the larger asymmetry ( chirality ) of the electronic environment of the tungsten nucleus , introduced by substituting atoms of different size and electronegativity .",
    "it is also possible to analyze the impact of atomic substitution with respect to the different electronegativities ( @xmath110 ) of the substituents , which is largest for fluorine and smallest for hydrogen : the relative sequence of electronegativities ( @xmath110 ) of the substituents is @xmath111 with @xmath112 . as mentioned earlier , this could explain , why in the first series of molecules there is a pronounced increase in the absolute values of both @xmath105 and @xmath94 upon fluorine substitution .",
    "it could also explain an increase in pv properties upon substitution of hydrogen for one of the three heavier halogens , but it is less clear , why there should be such a pronounced increase even when hydrogen is substituted for fluorine .",
    "regarding pv nmr frequency splittings , a comparison with @xmath113c nmr shielding tensors in chbrclf and chbrfi presented in ref",
    ". shows , that like the pv energy difference , the isotropic @xmath90w nmr shielding constants are of opposite sign in this series and the relative ordering of the resulting frequency splittings is also changed : in ref .",
    "the @xmath113c nmr shieldings in chbrclf and chbrfi are similar in size with the ordering depending on the choice of density functional . in the present study ,",
    "the isotropic @xmath90w pv nmr shielding constant in nwbrfi is almost twice as large as that in nwbrclf .",
    "however , for the values of @xmath102 reported in refs .",
    ", the increase from chbrclf to chbrfi is even more pronounced than the one reported herein for the @xmath90w shieldings in nwbrclf and nwbrfi .",
    "we have studied pv effects for the nmr shielding tensor in chiral tungsten compounds within the zora approach .",
    "we found that pv nmr frequency splittings seem to be even more sensitive to atomic substitution than pv energies , with an increase of @xmath94 by three orders of magnitude from nwbrcli to nwhfi !",
    "this sensitivity offers excellent prospects for the design of thermodynamically stable compounds suited for a nmr experiment aiming at molecular pv , where it would seem prudent to surround a heavy , nmr active nucleus in the chiral center of a molecule with ligands providing a strongly heterogeneous electronic environment .    financial support by the volkswagen foundation and computer time provided by the center of scientific computing ( csc ) frankfurt are gratefully acknowledged .",
