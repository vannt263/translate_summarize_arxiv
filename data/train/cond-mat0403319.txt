    "re - entrant `` laser - induced '' freezing@xcite ( rlif ) has received considerable attention@xcite in recent times .",
    "a static interference pattern obtained by two crossed laser beams provides an external potential periodic in one dimension ( 1-d ) which induces a system of dielectric colloidal particles , confined in two dimensions ( 2-d ) , to freeze .",
    "surprisingly , a further increase in potential strength causes a _",
    "reentrant melting_@xcite transition .",
    "qualitatively , starting from a liquid phase , the external periodic potential immediately induces a density modulation , reducing fluctuations which leads to solidification .",
    "further increase in potential confines the system to decoupled 1-d strips .",
    "the dimensional reduction now _",
    "increases _ fluctuations remelting the system .",
    "the early mean field theories , namely , landau theory@xcite and density functional theory@xcite predicted a change from a first order to continuous transition with increase in potential strength and failed to describe the reentrant behavior , a conclusion seemingly confirmed by early simulations@xcite . quite generally however , in 2-d",
    ", the effect of thermal fluctuations is substantial and mean field theory may obtain qualitatively wrong results especially for fluctuation driven transitions .",
    "following the defect mediated disordering approach of kosterlitz and thouless @xcite(kt ) , frey , nelson and radzihovsky@xcite(fnr ) proposed a detailed theory for the reentrant transition based on the unbinding of dislocations with burger s vector parallel to the line of potential minima .",
    "more accurate simulation studies@xcite on systems of hard disks@xcite , soft disks@xcite , dlvo@xcite etc . confirmed the reentrant freezing - melting transition in agreement with experiments@xcite and fnr theory . a systematic finite size scaling analysis@xcite of simulation results for the 2-d hard disk system in a 1-d modulating potential showed , in fact , several universal features consistent with the predictions of fnr theory . non universal predictions , namely the phase diagram , on the other hand , are difficult to compare because the fnr approach ( like kt theory ) is expressed in terms of the appropriate elastic moduli which are notoriously time - consuming to compute near a continuous phase transition . diverging correlation lengths and times near the phase transition point further complicate an accurate evaluation of the non universal predictions of the theory .",
    ".2 cm    in this letter , we calculate the phase diagram of a 2-d hard disk system with a modulating potential ( see fig",
    ".  [ phdia ] ) following a monte carlo renormalization approach proposed recently@xcite for the xy - model .",
    "the twin problems of diverging length and time scales are eliminated by simulating a constrained system which _ does not _",
    "undergo a phase transition !",
    "this is achieved by rejecting all monte carlo moves which tend to distort an unit cell in a way which changes the local connectivity@xcite .",
    "the percentage of moves thus rejected is a measure of the dislocation fugacity@xcite .",
    "this , together with the elastic constants of the dislocation free lattice obtained separately , are our inputs ( bare values ) to the renormalization flow equations@xcite to find out the melting points and hence the phase diagram . our results ( fig .",
    "[ phdia ] ) clearly show a modulated liquid ( ml ) @xmath0 locked floating solid ( lfs ) @xmath0 ml re - entrant transition with increase in the amplitude ( @xmath1 ) of the potential . in general , we find , the predictions of fnr theory to be valid .",
    "the location of the phase transition as evaluated within this theory with our inputs , show _ excellent _ agreement with earlier simulations@xcite throughout the @xmath2 plane ( @xmath3 with @xmath4 boltzmann constant and @xmath5 temperature , @xmath6 packing fraction ) .",
    "we discuss our calculations in detail below .",
    ".2 cm    the bulk system of hard disks where particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 , in 2-d , interact via the potential @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 for @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the hard disk diameter and @xmath14 the relative position vector of the particles , is known to melt@xcite from a high density triangular lattice to an isotropic liquid with a narrow intervening hexatic phase@xcite .",
    "simulations@xcite , experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite studies of hard disks show that for @xmath15 the system exists as a triangular lattice which transforms to a liquid below @xmath16 .",
    "the small intervening region contains a hexatic phase predicted by the kthny theory@xcite of 2-d melting .",
    "apart from being easily accessible to theoretical treatment@xcite , experimental systems with nearly `` hard '' interactions viz .",
    "sterically stabilized colloids@xcite are available .",
    "the hard disk free energy is entirely entropic in origin and the only thermodynamically relevant variable is the number density @xmath17 or the packing fraction @xmath18 .",
    ".2 cm    .2 cm",
    "in presence of a periodic external potential , the only other energy scale present in the system is the relative potential@xcite strength @xmath19 . a cartoon of the system considered for our study is given in fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] . for a solid in presence of a modulating potential @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] ) displacement mode @xmath21 becomes massive , leaving massless @xmath22 modes . after integrating out the @xmath21 modes the free energy of the lfs may be expressed in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath19 dependent elastic moduli@xcite , namely , the young s modulus @xmath23 and shear modulus @xmath24 , @xmath25\\ ] ] .2 cm    similar arguments@xcite show that among the three sets of low energy dislocations available in the 2-d triangular lattice , only those ( type i ) with burger s vector parallel to the line of potential minima survive at large @xmath19 .",
    "dislocations with burger s vector pointing along the other two possible close - packed directions ( type ii ) in the 2-d triangular lattice have larger energies because surrounding atoms are forced to ride the crests of the periodic potential@xcite . within this set of assumptions ,",
    "the system therefore shares the same symmetries as the xy model .",
    "indeed , a simple rescaling of @xmath26 and @xmath27 leads this free energy to the free energy of the xy - model with spin - wave stiffness @xmath28 and spin angle @xmath29 . the corresponding theory for phase transitions",
    "can then be recast as a kt theory@xcite and can be described in the framework of a two parameter renormalization flow for the spin - wave stiffness @xmath30 and the fugacity of type i dislocations @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a measure of length scale as @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the size of the system .",
    "the flow equations can be expressed in terms of @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the core energy of type i dislocations which can be obtained from the dislocation probability@xcite .",
    "keeping upto next to leading order terms in @xmath38 the renormalization group flow equations@xcite are , @xmath39 flows in @xmath32 generated by the above equations starting from initial or `` bare '' values of @xmath40 and @xmath38 fall in two categories . if , as @xmath41 , @xmath38 diverges , the thermodynamic phase is disordered ( i.e. ml ) , while on the other hand if @xmath38 vanishes , it is an ordered phase ( a lfs)@xcite .",
    "the two kinds of flows are demarcated by the _ separatrix _ which marks the phase transition point . for the linearized equations the separatrix is simply the straight line @xmath42 , whereas for the full non - linear equations one needs to calculate this numerically .",
    "we obtain the bare @xmath38 and @xmath40 from monte carlo simulations of @xmath43 hard disks and use them as initial values for numerically solving the eqs.([floweq ] ) .",
    "the bare numbers are relatively insensitive to system size since our monte carlo simulation does not involve a diverging correlation length .",
    "this is achieved as follows@xcite .",
    "we monitor individual random moves of a hard disk ( after checking for overlaps with neighbors ) and look for distortions of the neighboring unit cells .",
    "if in any of these unit cells the length of a next nearest neighbor bond tends to become smaller than a nearest neighbor bond , the move is rejected .",
    "the probabilities of such bond breaking moves are however computed by keeping track of the number of such rejected moves .",
    "one has to keep track of three possible distortions of the unit rhombus ( see fig .",
    "[ dislo ] inset ) with measured probabilities @xmath44 .",
    "each of these distortions involves two dislocation - antidislocation pairs which , we assume , occur independently .",
    "the probabilities for occurrence of the dislocation pairs themselves @xmath45 ( fig .  [ dislo ] ) which are proportional to the square of the fugacities , can then be computed easily eg .",
    "finally , we obtain the required dislocation fugacity @xmath38 by normalizing @xmath47 to the known@xcite dislocation fugacities for @xmath48 at any @xmath49 .",
    "the same restricted monte carlo simulation can be used to find out the stress tensor , and the elastic moduli from the stress - strain curve , following the method described by farago _ et .",
    "al._@xcite . the errors in",
    "` bare ' elastic moduli are at worst within a percent .",
    ".2 cm    in fig .",
    "[ flow ] we have plotted the bare values of @xmath40 and @xmath38 for @xmath50 along with the separatrices for the linearized and the non - linear flow equations ( eq . [ floweq ] ) .",
    "the line of initial conditions is seen to cross the non - linear separatrix twice ( signifying re - entrant behaviour ) while crossing the corresponding linearized separatrix only once at high potential strengths . the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ phdia ] ) is obtained by computing the points at which the line of initial conditions cut the non - linear separatrix using a simple interpolation scheme .",
    "it is interesting to note that within a linear theory the kt flow equations fail to predict a rlif transition .",
    ".2 cm further , comparing with previous computations@xcite of the phase diagram for this system ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ phdia ] ) we find that our results agree at all values of @xmath49 and @xmath19 .",
    "this validates both our method and the quantitative predictions of ref .",
    "the effect of higher order terms in determining non - universal quantities has been pointed out earlier@xcite for the planar rotor model but in the present case their inclusion appears to be crucial . in view of the fact that the linear flow equation predicts a solid phase at all but the largest values of @xmath19 we require at least upto next to leading order corrections in flow to obtain meaningful results .",
    "even then , we expect our procedure to break down at high packing fractions in the @xmath51 limit where effects due to the cross - over from a kt to a kthny@xcite transition at @xmath48 become significant . indeed , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ dislo ] for @xmath52 the dislocation probabilities of both type i and type ii dislocations are similar and our process ( which involves only type i dislocations ) fails to produce melting as @xmath51 for @xmath53  the solid line in fig .",
    "1 being an extrapolation from our results for smaller @xmath49 .",
    "this fact is also supported by ref.@xcite where it was shown that though at @xmath54 the scaling of susceptibility and order parameter cumulants gave good data collapse with values of critical exponents close to fnr predictions , at @xmath55 , on the other hand , ordinary critical scaling gave better data collapse than the kt scaling form , perhaps due to the above mentioned crossover effects . in the asymptotic limit of @xmath56 the system freezes above @xmath57 which was determined from a separate simulation in that limit .",
    "this number is very close to the earlier value @xmath58 quoted in ref.@xcite . as expected , the freezing density in the @xmath59 limit is lower than the value without the periodic potential .",
    "in conclusion , using fnr theory we calculate the phase diagram for a 2-d system of hard disks under a commensurate modulating potential to find extremely good agreement with earlier simulated results .",
    "we show that the re - entrance behavior is built into the ` bare ' quantities themselves . to obtain the correct phase diagram , however , flow equations need to be correct at least upto next to leading order terms in the dislocation fugacity .",
    "our results , especially for small potential strengths , is particularly sensitive to these terms .",
    "cross - over effects from zero potential kthny melting transition are also substantial at small values of the potential .",
