    "this flattening feature in the attenuation curve disappears if the ebl slope is @xmath23 , as for example in the model by stecker 2006@xcite , for which a continuous steepening is expected ( fig .",
    "[ eblsed ] ) .",
    "this flattening feature is not a consequence of the large width of the @xmath9-@xmath9 cross section , but only of the slope of the spectrum of target photons .",

    "to put constraints on the ebl , it is necessary to make assumptions on the blazar intrinsic spectrum .",

    "the main assumptions are based on : + 1 ) the hardness of the vhe spectrum , and in general the absence of exponential up - turns or pile - up features ; + 2 ) the extrapolation of the fermi - lat spectrum to the vhe band ; + 3 ) the ssc / ec modeling of the full sed .",
    "one of the most general and robust approaches to ebl limits is to require the reconstructed gamma - ray spectrum to simply stay within the known range of properties of the source@xcite . since the spectral steepening increases with ebl intensity",
    ", upper limits can be derived by adopting an hardness limit on the reconstructed gamma - ray spectrum , comprising the absence of sharp pile - up features .",
    "blazars show a wide range of spectra , but are typically characterized by @xmath25 at frequencies corresponding to the highest particle energies@xcite .",
    "these values can be easily produced with standard shock acceleration and cooling mechanisms .",
    "other scenarios with much harder particle spectra are theoretically possible , and have been studied in the context of blazars even producing pile - up or line - like emission features ( see e.g. ref . and references therein ) .",
    "however , they have never been significantly detected in blazars so far , neither directly or by synchrotron emission , requiring a cosmic conspiracy to avoid conflicts with multi - wavelength sed data .",
    "the photon index @xmath26=1.5 can therefore be used as reference value , representing so far the borderline between reality and speculation ( see discussion in ref . ) .",
    "the ebl upper limits from spectral hardness are in general not affected by cascades in the intergalactic medium . the electromagnetic cascade initiated by the primary gamma - rays transfer the energy output from the absorbed to the transparent part of a gamma - ray spectrum ( i.e. from high to low energies at vhe ) .",
    "even assuming a null intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) , therefore , the addition of the full cascade contribution further steepens the observed vhe spectrum ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    ") , making the ebl limits even more constraining .",
    "similar considerations are valid when there is additional gamma - gamma absorption in the source , if the target photon field is sufficiently broad - banded . internal absorption on a broad - band target field reinforces the ebl attenuation curve , and the resulting additional steepening would make the ebl limits even more stringent .",
    "the exception is if the target field is narrow - banded , for example as a planckian distribution@xcite . in such case the optical depth can also decrease with energy , in some spectral band .",
    "internal gamma - gamma absorption can thus make the emerging gamma - ray spectrum even _ harder _ than the emitted one .",
    "this can be an effective way to produce very hard spectra without assuming hard particle distributions , at the expense of source luminosity@xcite .",
    "the absence of strong fluxes in the fermi - lat band ( which should be transparent in this picture ) does not lend support to this scenario for the hard tev bllacs , but for other bl lacs with high fermi - lat fluxes it could provide an elegant explanation for observed mis - matches between he and vhe spectra ( see e.g. ref . ) .      at wavelengths up to 1 - 2",
    "@xmath1 , no meaningful limit ( i.e. below the direct estimates ) to the ebl could be derived until 2005 , because of the general softness or low redshift of the detected sources .",

    "these anomalous features disappear considering a slightly higher overall ebl level ( especially in the uv part ) , which would cancel the inflection break and excess hardness .",
    "neglecting the egret spectrum , taken more than 10 years before and of low significance , the resulting sed could still be typical for a blazar , with an ic peak at few tev@xcite .",

    "only objects detected at least above 10@xmath73 were considered . to reduce the space of free parameters to a manageable size , the ebl spectrum was fixed to a single shape ( adopting the calculation by ref . as template ) , leaving only the normalization free .",
    "the blazar intrinsic spectrum was assumed to be smooth ( i.e. with no abrupt breaks or pile - up features ) , and overall convex , but with no assumption on its hardness .",

    "there are two main problems with this approach , besides the weakness of the assumption of only convex blazar spectra ( see sect .",
    "[ extralat ] and [ sedlimits ] ) .",
    "one is on the application of the maximum likelihood method itself , the other is the bias introduced by combining the ts functions .    given the complex interaction between the intrinsic blazar spectrum and the shape of ebl attenuation , there is no guarantee that the combination of the two which maximizes the likelihood is the correct one . indeed , among different objects the maximum probabilities occur at very different ebl normalizations , implying _ de facto _ that the true value is certainly _ not _ given by the peak of the @xmath78  probability ( see fig.1 in ref .",
    "this invalidates the main assumption .",
    "in addition , in each single source the @xmath78  probability peaks at very different opacity levels depending on the intrinsic models , but often with very similar peak probabilities ( e.g. between 50 and 60% ) for very different opacity values , making the choice of one of them somewhat arbitrary . the reported uncertainties , therefore , appear strongly underestimated , undermining the significance of the detection .",
    "fact is , all vhe spectra detected so far can be well fitted with smooth functions and perfectly acceptable statistical goodness ( @xmath74@xmath79 ) for any ebl normalization between the lower limits from galaxy counts ( and even below that ) and the direct measurements in the 2 - 4 @xmath1  band .",
    "concerning the best - fit value , the combination of the ts functions makes the result , by construction , heavily biased towards datasets with higher statistics , which in this case means the datasets of pks2155 - 304@xcite .",
    "this object is characterized by a rather steep and intrinsically curved spectrum , which partly cancel the amplitude of the flattening feature imprinted by the ebl on the observed spectra .",
    "this allows for a higher - than - real ebl density to be considered viable with a high ts . as a result ,",
    "the combined ts is likely biased towards higher ebl values than they actually are .    despite these shortcomings ,",
    "this result does confirm that on average the blazar vhe spectra seem better fitted including some amount of ebl absorption rather than not , thus supporting the fermi - lat result against the null hypothesis .",
    "this is precisely the expected effect of the flattening feature shown in fig .",
    "[ flattening ] .",
    "it is always possible to consider this result as due to an intrinsic property of the blazar emission , but again it would require an extreme fine tuning to make it always appear at the same energy , irrespective of source redshift , as to mimic precisely the effects of absorption by an ebl spectrum consistent with galaxy evolution .",
    "alternative explanations look for ways to circumvent the severe intergalactic absorption caused by photon - photon collisions with the ebl photons , in order to increase the _ effective _ mean free path of tev gamma - rays .",
    "this can be accomplished either by introducing new fundamental physics , or by considering the observed gamma - rays as secondary emission resulting from the development of electromagnetic cascades in the intergalactic medium .      a  straightforward \" way to increase",
    "the transparency of the universe is to simply modify the cross section of the photon - photon collision and pair production process .",
    "quantum - gravity ( qg ) theories predict in general a breakdown of familiar physics when approaching the planck energy scale , and a violation of lorentz invariance arises naturally in various such theories@xcite .",
    "the modification of the photon dispersion relation , such that vacuum becomes a refractive medium with index @xmath80 ( @xmath81=1 or 2 ) , can lead to a shift of the threshold for pair production at higher energies , as well as an energy - dependent time - of - flight for photons .",
    "the shift of the gamma - gamma cross section is expected to cause the optical depth to decrease again as photon energy increases , leading to a re - emergence of the source flux at higher energies which can be best tested with the future cherenkov telescope like cta@xcite and hawc@xcite .",
    "time - of - flight analyses provide the most generic method of testing lorentz invariance@xcite .",
    "they have been performed for different cosmological gamma - ray sources , looking for delays in the time of arrival of gamma - ray photons at different energies during the fastest flares . though the detection of such feature needs to address the possibility of its astrophysical origin ( i.e. intrinsic to the source ) , upper limits on the delays allow lower limits on the qg mass scale to be derived ( see review@xcite ) .",
    "the most stringent limits have been derived so far on the linear term , from gamma - ray bursts with individual photons above 10 gev ( @xmath82 gev from grb080916c@xcite and @xmath83 gev from grb090510@xcite ) and from the brightest tev blazars at vhe energies ( @xmath84 gev from pks2155 - 304@xcite , and @xmath85 gev from mkn501@xcite ) .    another way to increase the effective mean free path is to assume the oscillation of photons into hypothetical axion - like particles ( alps ) in the presence of a magnetic field@xcite . no evidence has been found in support of this possibility so far .",
    "one of the most constraining bounds on the the product of the photon - alp coupling @xmath86 times b has been obtained by studying the rotation of the linear polarization measured in uv photons in radio galaxies at cosmological distances ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath87 gev@xmath32 ng for ultralight alps with mass @xmath88 ev .      cosmic ray ( cr ) protons with ultra - high energy ( uhe ) below the gzk cutoff ( e.g. @xmath89 ev ) do not lose a significant part of their energy in interactions with background photons .",
    "they can thus provide an effective way to transport energy over large cosmological distances , to be deposited back into photons closer to the observer via electromagnetic cascades .",
    "cascades are initiated by interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and ebl photons via pair production @xmath90 and photomeson reactions @xmath91 , and are supported by the ic scattering of electrons on the cmb and @xmath92 interactions again with ebl and cmb photons .",
    "as long as the the magnetic field along the path is small enough ( @xmath93 gauss ) , uhe protons can travel almost rectilinearly and the broadening of both the proton beam and the cascade electrons due to deflections in the igmf can be less than the point spread function of the air - cherenkov detectors ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "secondary gamma - rays can then add up to the primary emission without smearing the vhe point - like images of blazars .",
    "secondary gamma - rays are produced all along the path , but because they are generated closer to the observer , they are correspondingly less suppressed by ebl absorption .",
    "though the probability of the @xmath95 interaction is very small , for distant sources ( @xmath96 ) and sufficiently high proton flux , the secondary emission can become dominant over the primary emission , the latter being filtered out by the stronger ebl suppression over the full distance@xcite .",

    "* b ) * no temporal variability is expected from secondary gamma - rays on short timescales .",
    "proton deflections and the electromagnetic cascade introduce long time delays , of the order of a year for 1 tev photons ( and longer at lower energies ) , already at z=0.17@xcite .",

    "furthermore , gamma - ray variations should not be correlated with variations at lower frequencies ( e.g. in optical or x - ray bands ) , which are related to the primary emission .",
    "this scenario faces two main problems .    *",
    "1 ) energetics*. even if the uhe protons are beamed at the origin like the primary gamma - rays from blazars , for all possible sites of cr production in agn ( black - hole , jet , lobe , terminal shocks etc . ) they have to travel for kpc through regions of relatively strong magnetic field , from milli to nano gauss ( e.g. the jet itself , the lobe , possibly the host galaxy and its surroundings , the possible cluster where the agn lives and the large - scale filament ; see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "a magnetic field of 1 ng over 1 kpc is sufficient to deflect a @xmath102ev proton for more than @xmath103 , and 1 @xmath104 g is sufficient over less than 10 pc .",
    "the net effect is either to strongly broaden the proton beam ( if b is random on sufficiently small scales ) , or to deflect it away from the observer ( if b is coherent over a sufficiently large region ) .",
    "therefore , the jet opening angle can not be assumed for the proton beam as well , in order to reduce the requirements on the intrinsic cosmic ray luminosity ( e.g. by a factor @xmath105 as in ref . ) .",
    "for realistic estimates , blazars and agn should be treated at minimum as isotropic sources of uhe protons .",
    "the luminosities in cr required in this scenario are then of the order of @xmath106 erg / s @xcite , for sources ( tev bl lacs ) whose total jet kinetic power considering one proton for electron is estimated in the range @xmath107 erg / s @xcite .    *",
    "2 ) deflections in the large scale structure*. this model requires that a typical line of sight does not cross regions of magnetic field larger than @xmath108 g. while the size and space density of scatterers like galaxies and galaxy clusters in the universe is small enough@xcite , the impact of the filaments in the large scale structure ( lss ) is still uncertain .",
    "observations and simulations shows that the universe is a large mesh of voids of size 20 - 100 mpc , connected by filaments@xcite .",
    "the intensity of the magnetic field seems to follow the mass density as @xmath109 , yielding nano - gauss fields over possibly 10 - 20 mpc regions@xcite .",
    "though the size , volume filling factors and geometry of the magnetic regions remain highly uncertain , it seems unlikely for a random line of sight to gpc distances not to cross any region at near - nanogauss level .",
    "there is no proper study so far on the probability that a random line of sight intercepts regions with @xmath110 gauss , and how this probability increases with redshift .",
    "however , it is safe to assume that , by its very nature , this scenario should work only for a small subset of line of sights ( i.e sources ) , and not for all blazars .",
    "the exact redshift and energy of the transition between the primary and secondary spectrum is uncertain , being also source - dependent .",
    "it is therefore important to assess the viability of this scenario in the whole energy range above @xmath111 tev , for sources at @xmath96 .",
    "considering spectra up to 1 - 2 tev , which form the large majority of all vhe detections so far , blazars show a wide range of spectral slopes in the same redshift bins , up to z@xmath180.3 : for example , rxj0648 + 15@xcite ( @xmath112 , z=0.179 ) and 1es1101 - 232@xcite ( @xmath113 , z=0.186 ) .",
    "the vhe emission is often strongly correlated with variations at lower energies ( x - rays , optical ) . in principle",
    "only the hard vhe sources should be those dominated by the secondary emission , while the soft and variable spectra would be explained by the primary emission .",
    "however , day - scale variability is seen also in hard sources ( e.g. 1es1218 + 304@xcite ) and the line of sight of another hard blazar ( h2356 - 309@xcite , @xmath114 , z=0.165 ) is known to intercept at least 3 lss filaments@xcite at z=0.03 ( sculptur wall ) , z=0.062 ( pisces - cetus supercluster ) and z=0.128 ( farther sculptur wall ) .",
    "these results disfavour a secondary origin of the gamma - rays and demonstrate that hard features are a property of the primary emission as well .",
    "furthermore , the predicted secondary spectrum fits well the hard tev sources only in the case of the stecker 2006 ebl model@xcite .",
    "the latter is however excluded by the fermi - lat result and is at odds with all most recent ebl calculations .",
    "changing ebl values , the predicted spectra do not match well the vhe data anymore ( see fig . 1 in ref . ) .",
    "for blazars at z=0.4 - 0.5 , the measured spectra would appear consistent with secondary emission ( e.g. 3c66a@xcite , z=0.4 @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , some sources with compatible spectra do show fast variability correlated with x - ray and optical activity ( e.g. 1es 1553 + 113@xcite , @xmath116 ) .    in summary ,",
    "up to @xmath117 and e@xmath181 - 2 tev , observations do not support in fact mostly disfavour the interpretation of gamma - rays as secondary emission from uhe protons .",
    "this is also in agreement with some estimates@xcite for the transition between primary and secondary emission ( e@xmath1181 tev ) .",
    "since the ebl limits around few microns are based on vhe spectra up to these values of energy and redshift , the scenario of proton - induced cascades seems not able to relax the constraints on the ebl at the peak of the stellar contribution .    above e@xmath01 - 2",
    "tev , instead , the issue remains open . at present , only three distant blazars have been measured up to 6 - 10 tev : pks2155 - 304@xcite ( z=0.116 ) , 1es1426 + 428@xcite ( z=0.129 ) and 1es0229 + 200@xcite ( z=0.140 ) . the fast , correlated variability and spectral steepness of pks 2155 - 304 above 1 tev@xcite rules out a secondary origin for the gamma - rays in this source .",
    "this leaves 1es0229 + 200 ( @xmath119 ) and 1es1426 + 429 ( @xmath120 ) as the _ only _ two sources for which the cascade scenario is actually viable , though their spectra are fully consistent with and naturally explained by the characteristic feature imprinted by pure ebl absorption onto a primary emission ( fig .",
    "[ flattening ] ) .",
    "though this scenario is not favoured by the data so far , it is important to keep in mind that the efficiency of energy transfer from protons to gamma - rays reaches its maximum at z@xmath121 ( depending on gamma - ray energy ) , and that it can be rather high ( @xmath122 ) even at 10 tev@xcite .",
    "this scenario therefore provides a channel for the production of multi - tev gamma - rays that in principle could give a non - negligible contribution to the quiescent component of the vhe emission from some nearby blazars@xcite .",
    "the situation is completely different for sources at large redshifts . beyond z=1 , gamma - rays above several hundred gev",
    "are strongly suppressed by intergalactic absorption , with optical depths @xmath123 for any realistic model of the ebl@xcite .",
    "only a negligible fraction of the primary emission can therefore survive and reach the observer ( unless considering apparent gamma - ray luminosities well in excess of @xmath124 erg / s ) .",
    "the detection of tev gamma - rays from objects beyond z=1 , therefore , would challenge standard interpretations , and would justify the introduction of changes in fundamental laws of physics like the violation of lorentz invariance or oscillations with alps particles . to this respect , the scenario of secondary photons from uhe protons accelerated at the source would become very appealing .",
    "this model could provide the _ only viable astrophysical interpretation _",
    "consistent with conventional physics@xcite , provided that the spectral and temporal behavior of the data are consistent , and that energetics and line - of - sight problems can be overcome .",
    "remarkably , it would directly imply that agn jets are very powerful and very efficient accelerators of uhe protons .",
    "such scenario was indeed fostered by an initial claim of large redshift ( @xmath125 ) for the tev blazar pks0447 - 489@xcite , whose gamma - ray spectrum was measured up to @xmath181 tev@xcite . the vhe spectrum was found consistent with secondary emission@xcite , and provided a case study for such possibility .",
    "however , recently it has been shown that the redshift estimate is most likely incorrect@xcite .",
    "the absorption feature seen at 6280   is not a redshifted mg ii line ( as initially thought ) but most likely originates in earth s atmosphere , being detected in the spectra of multiple standard stars in the same observing runs@xcite .",
    "the redshift of pks0447 - 489 remains thus uncertain .",

    "furthermore , 2 ) for a fixed intrinsic spectrum the observed ( absorbed ) spectral index takes different values ( even by @xmath131 ) depending on the detected energy band , due to the energy dependence of the ebl optical depth .",
    "both these effects cause a large scatter in the @xmath127 plot , which is also possibly biased by source luminosity and target choice .",
    "a fit in the @xmath127 space , therefore , is not a valid method to derive ebl conclusions .",
    "the important observable is the envelope of the measured spectral slopes , which is delimited and drawn by the hardest spectra observed at each redshift .",
    "this envelope shows indeed a clear evolution with redshift ( see fig . 4 in ref . ) which is fully consistent with the expectations for a low ebl model@xcite .",
    "similar considerations apply to the @xmath128 dependence , which was used to claim the existence of two populations of vhe spectra@xcite .",
    "the evidence for two populations was mainly based on the initial estimates of high redshift for the two tev blazars pks0447 - 489 ( z=1.246 ) and 3c66a ( z=0.58 ) , and in comparison with the very strong @xmath128 evolution predicted@xcite for the high - ebl model by ref .",
    "[ deltagamma ] ) .",
    "the latter however is ruled out by both fermi - lat and vhe results .",
    "the evidence disappears completely considering the updated redshift estimates ( uncertain for pks0447 - 489@xcite and @xmath132 for 3c66a@xcite ) and the milder redshift evolution given by more realistic ebl models consistent with fermi - lat results@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ deltagamma ] ) . furthermore , to appear in the plot a source needs to be well detected in both he and vhe bands . as redshift increases ,",
    "more luminous sources are detected , which tend to be characterized by lower - energy peaked seds and thus softer fermi - lat and intrinsic vhe spectra .",
    "since it is difficult for cherenkov telescopes to detect faint vhe spectra with slopes much steeper than @xmath133 , @xmath126 can not show values much larger than @xmath134 .",
    "this introduces an observational limit in the @xmath128 plot , as in fact observed .",
    "because of these biases , and the possibility of the vhe spectra to be harder than the he ones , it can be expected for @xmath126 to exhibit a weaker dependence with redshift than @xmath129 . again , so far the observational data are fully consistent with a low ebl scenario .      considering the lowest possible ebl model as given by the galaxy counts in each waveband@xcite",
    ", a tendency has been recently noted@xcite for the absorption - corrected vhe spectra to show an upturn in the transition region from the optically thin to the optically thick regime ( from @xmath135 to @xmath136 ) . for the 7 sources with data in both regimes ,",
    "this transition occurs on a broad range of energies ( 0.4 - 21 tev ) and redshifts ( z=0.031 - 0.539 ) , yielding a combined significance between 2 and 4@xmath73 depending on the consideration of different systematic effects@xcite .",
    "since intrinsic source features would imply an extreme fine tuning , this trend has been interpreted as indication of a suppression of the pair production in the propagation of vhe photons , possibly due to alps coupling .    however , the optically thick data points are typically at the endpoint of the measured energy spectra , where the statistics is very low and the limited energy resolution leads to possible spill - over effects@xcite , which can cause a systematic over - estimate of the flux .",
    "furthermore , the lower - limit ebl model might not represent a  minimal case \" for these studies .",
    "the correction for absorption depends strongly also on the shape of the ebl spectrum .",
    "if the lower - limit ebl model underestimate the true ebl more strongly at @xmath137 than at @xmath138 , for example , it would lead to a flatter - than - real ebl spectrum between the two wavelengths and thus to an apparent excess or upturn in the reconstructed spectra in the 1 - 10 tev range , where most of the data endpoints actually are . above 10 tev ,",
    "the reconstructed spectra are very sensitive to even tiny changes in the ebl shape in its warm - dust component , which is highly uncertain . in fact",
    ", the anomaly seems to disappear as soon as the statistics increases and with a more standard ebl model as given by ref .",
    "( e.g. for the 2006 pks2155 - 304 flare spectrum@xcite , detected up to 6 - 7 tev corresponding to @xmath139 ) .",
    "together , the low statistics ( both in photons and number of sources ) , the data - analysis uncertainties , the ebl - shape effects and the lack of anomaly with higher - statistics spectra and more standard ebl models point towards a spurious origin for the anomaly rather than a change to the gamma - gamma cross - section .",
    "the energy of the primary gamma - ray is not lost in the interaction with ebl photons .",
    "the resulting electron - positron pair can upscatter cmb photons again into gamma - ray energies , as they cool , with typical values @xmath140 tev@xcite .    for photons above @xmath141 tev ,",
    "the photon absorption length @xmath142 is typically short , the pairs are produced within few mpc of the source , in regions where the magnetic field is still relatively high , and thus cascading effectively surrounds the source with a giant , isotropically emitting halo of pairs@xcite .",
    "if the gamma - ray source is a strong emitter above 20 - 50 tev , therefore , the pair halo radiation can become observable at vhe below few tev , as extended emission whose size depends essentially on the local ebl intensity@xcite .",
    "no imaging of the pair halos has been obtained so far , though hopefully their emission could be within reach of the future cherenkov telescope cta@xcite .    for photons below @xmath143 tev , instead , the pairs are produced predominantly in the intergalactc space and the secondary emission occurs in the gev domain@xcite . if the igmf is large enough , pairs are deflected significantly before cooling by ic , broadening and suppressing the secondary emission flux . if it is small enough , the secondary emission can remain concentrated close to the primary emission cone , thus adding to the object s he spectrum .",
    "the comparison of the he with the vhe spectra ( which determines with the ebl the absorbed energy flux ) , can therefore probe the poorly known strength of the igmf@xcite .",
    "the fermi - lat spectra and upper limits obtained so far on several tev bl lacs allow a lower limit to the igmf intensity to be put at a level of @xmath144 g@xcite .",
    "the limits on the igmf depend however on the intensity of the ebl .",
    "a higher ebl leads to a higher absorbed gamma - ray luminosity , thus generating a stronger cascade contribution which require a stronger igmf not to overproduce the fermi - lat measurements at he@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a higher ebl implies a harder intrinsic source spectrum , leaving more room in the he band to accomodate the additional softer cascade emission .",
    "the recent detection of 1es0229 + 200 with fermi - lat@xcite allowed the exploration of the 3d parameter space given by igmf strength vs ebl intensity ( using template by ref . ) vs intrinsic photon index @xmath145 ( varied within the range from 1.50@xcite ) .",
    "taking into account the fermi - lat result@xcite in favour of a low ebl density , which means @xmath146 , the 1es0229 + 200 data at he and vhe together constrain the igmf to @xmath147 g. this constrain could be even stronger by assuming that the source was stable at vhe on time scales longer than the @xmath183 years timespan of the h.e.s.s . and veritas observations@xcite .",
    "this igmf lower limit is essentially determined by the statistical error on the fermi - lat data , since the he spectrum should be strongly dominated by the primary emission , as also indicated by the variability of the he detection ( the bulk of the fermi - lat signal comes from 2011 observations@xcite ) .",
    "the new data provided by cherenkov telescopes and the fermi satellite have brought substantial progress in the study of the ebl through gamma - rays .",
    "together with the lower limits from the integrated light from galaxies , the vhe spectra of hard bl lacs and the collective signal in the fermi - lat band have dramatically narrowed down the possible region in the parameters space for a consistent picture of both ebl spectrum , galaxy evolution and overall blazar phenomenology .",
    "the consistent and convergent picture which is emerging from all the different data calls for a low - density ebl , as produced by standard galaxy evolution models . from uv to mir wavelengths ,",
    "the ebl is now pinned down in its direct starlight component to a level better than 10 - 15% .",
    "consequently , also the average intensity of the igmf is constrained to @xmath147 g.    at the time of writing , _ all _ gamma - ray data from blazars are fully consistent with this simple picure , and no significant evidence has clearly emerged either requiring or suggesting more complicated or exotic explanations . given the small room left between upper and lower limits , more and better data are expected to provide confirmations but no further improvements in the ebl stellar hump . the limiting ",
    "wall \" is essentially represented by the systematic uncertainty given by our ignorance in the details of blazar physics and jet physical conditions@xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the precision with which some blazar models could in principle predict vhe spectra might be deceptive , being far from a comparable accuracy .    the most important progress and results are likely to come from gamma - ray spectra in the @xmath148 tev range , as allowed for example by the upcoming small - telescopes array in cta@xcite , its precursor astri project@xcite , and the hawc observatory@xcite .",
    "multi - tev spectra can open new scenarios , providing key answers to the study of 1 ) fundamental physics aspects , possibly revealing tev gamma - rays from high redshift sources , 2 ) blazars as possible sources of uhe protons ; 3 ) extreme acceleration and emission processes in the hard tev blazars , locating the peak of the ic emission in the sed above 1 - 10 tev , and 4 ) the uncertain warm and cold dust emission in the ebl , which can be probed only by multi - tev photons .",
    "hopefully the future tev observatories will achieve substantially larger collection areas as to dramatically improve the sensitivity and the quality of the spectra in this crucial energy range .",
    "i am grateful to g. tosti and m. ajello for helpful comments on the manuscript , and to f. aharonian and d. horns for years of fruitful discussions ."
