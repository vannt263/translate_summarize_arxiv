    "the new interface cement equilibrated mortar ( nicem ) method proposed in  @xcite is an equilibrated mortar domain decomposition method that allows for the use of optimized schwarz algorithms with robin interface conditions on non - conforming grids .",
    "it has been analyzed in  @xcite in 2d and 3d for @xmath0 elements .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend this numerical analysis in 2d for piecewise polynomials of higher order .",
    "we thus establish new numerical analysis results in the frame of finite element approximation and also present the iterative algorithm and prove its convergence in all these cases .",
    "we first consider the problem at the continuous level :  find @xmath1 such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are partial differential equations .",
    "the original schwarz algorithm is based on a decomposition of the domain @xmath5 into overlapping subdomains and the resolution of dirichlet boundary value problems in each subdomain .",
    "it has been proposed in  @xcite to use more general interface / boundary conditions for the problems on the subdomains in order to use a non - overlapping decomposition of the domain .",
    "the convergence factor is also dramatically reduced .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath5 be a @xmath6 ( or convex polygon in 2d or polyhedron in 3d ) domain of @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 ; we assume it is decomposed into @xmath10 non - overlapping subdomains : @xmath11 we suppose that the subdomains @xmath12 are either @xmath6 or polygons in 2d or polyhedrons in 3d .",
    "we assume also that this decomposition is geometrically conforming in the sense that the intersection of the closure of two different subdomains , if not empty , is either a common vertex , a common edge , or a common face of the subdomains in 3d .",
    "let @xmath13 be the outward normal from @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the chosen transmission conditions on the interface between subdomains @xmath14 and @xmath16 ( e.g. @xmath17 ) .",
    "what we shall call here a schwarz type method for the problem ( [ eq : pbgen])-([eq : pbgen2 ] ) is its reformulation :  find @xmath18 such that @xmath19 leading to the iterative procedure @xmath20 the convergence factor of associated schwarz - type domain decomposition methods depends largely on the choice of the transmission operators @xmath21 ( see for instance  @xcite and  @xcite ) . more precisely , transmission conditions which reduce dramatically the convergence factor of the algorithm have been proposed ( see  @xcite ) for a convection - diffusion equation , where coefficients in second order transmission conditions where optimized .    on the other hand , the mortar element method , first introduced in  @xcite ,",
    "enables the use of non - conforming grids , and thus parallel generation of meshes , local adaptive meshes and fast and independent solvers .",
    "it is also well suited to the use of `` dirichlet - neumann ''  ( @xcite ) , or `` neumann - neumann '' preconditioned conjugate gradient method applied to the schur complement matrix  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "a new cement to match robin interface conditions with non - conforming grids in the case of a finite volume discretization was introduced and analyzed .",
    "such an approach has been extended to a finite element discretization in  @xcite .",
    "a variant has been independently implemented in  @xcite for the maxwell equations , without numerical analysis .",
    "another approach , in the finite volume case , has been proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis of the nicem method proposed in  @xcite is done in  @xcite for @xmath0 finite elements , in 2d and 3d .",
    "these results are for interface conditions of order 0 ( i.e. @xmath22 ) and are the prerequisites for the goal in designing this non - overlapping method for interface conditions such as ventcel interface conditions which greatly enhance the information exchange between subdomains , see  @xcite for preliminary results on the extension of the nicem method to ventcel conditions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is first to present a general finite element nicem method in the case of @xmath23 finite elements , with @xmath24 in 2d and @xmath25 in 3d .",
    "we also provide a robin iterative algorithm and prove its convergence .",
    "then , we present in full details the error analysis in the case of piecewise polynomials of high order in 2d .    in section  [ sec.defmethod ] , we describe the nicem method in 2d and 3d",
    ". then , in section  [ sec.algo ] , we present the iterative algorithm at the continuous and discrete levels , and we prove , in both cases , the well - posedness and convergence of the iterative method , for polynomials of low and high order in 2d , and for @xmath0 finite elements in 3d . the convergence is also proven in 3d for @xmath23 finite elements , @xmath24 , in a weak sense . in section  [ sec.bestfit2d ]",
    "we extend the error estimates analysis given in  @xcite to 2d piecewise polynomials of higher order .",
    "we finally present in section  [ sec : numresults ] simulations for two and four subdomains , that fit the theoretical estimates .",
    "we consider the following problem : find @xmath1 such that [ initial_bvp1 ] ( i d - ) u & = & f + [ initial_bvp2 ] u & = & 0 , where @xmath26 is given in @xmath27 .",
