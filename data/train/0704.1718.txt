    "transverse axial next - nearest neighbour ising ( tannni ) model has attracted much attention recently as a simple quantum ising model with frustration . in one dimension",
    ", it is defined by the hamiltonian @xcite _ a = - j",
    "_ j=1^n ( s^z_j s^z_j+1 - s^z_j s^z_j+2 ) - _ j=1^n s^x_j where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the pauli matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 at the site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the strength of the nearest neighbour ferromagnetic interaction , @xmath8 is the frustration parameter and @xmath9 is the transverse field .",
    "the phase diagram of the ground state of this model in the @xmath8-@xmath9 plane shows interesting features and is a matter of much controversy and investigation .",
    "recently , we have shown @xcite that the ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath10 is related to a class of excited states of a much simpler hamiltonian obtained by removing the frustration ( i.e. setting @xmath11 ) , = - j _",
    "j=1^n s^z_j s^z_j+1 - _ j=1^n s^x_j .",
    "this hamiltonian defines what is called transverse ising model ( in one dimension ) and is the first quantum ising model to be solved exactly ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "all the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath12 for transverse ising model can be derived exactly @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 number of energy eigenvalues are e= 2 _ k _ k _ k where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 may be 0 , @xmath171 and @xmath18 runs over @xmath19 equispaced values in the interval 0 to @xmath20 .",
    "the ground state is obviously @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath22 for all @xmath18 and the excited states correspond to the other distributions of @xmath16 values .",
    "the spin - spin correlation function in the longitudinal direction c^z(n ) - < s^z_j>^2 has also been calculated exactly @xcite for the hamiltonian @xmath12 in the ground state ; it decays exponentially with distance at @xmath23 and algebraically ( with exponent = 1/4 ) at @xmath24 ( the critical point ) . as for the excited states ,",
    "the correlation was first studied by mccoy @xcite .",
    "the specific quantity calculated was the correlation at a temperature @xmath25 for the xy model ( which in turn can be mapped onto the transverse ising model ) .",
    "the correlation was found to decay exponentially with distance except when @xmath26 and @xmath24 .",
    "the basic motivation of the paper is that ( as mentioned above ) the ground state of the transverse axial next - nearest neighbour ising hamiltonian @xmath10 in the region of interest ( namely , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , see ref . [ 4 ] ) is related to a particular set of excited states of the transverse ising hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "this states have _ k = \\ {    rl -1 & + 1 &    .",
    "it is thus important to study these states for transverse ising model , especially , to calculate in these states , the longitudinal spin - spin correlation @xmath29 for large @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we provide exact calculation for this quantity .",
    "our result is that for these states , the correlation decays algebraically with exponent 1/2 for all values of @xmath23 , provided @xmath30 is neither 0 or @xmath20 ( some levels are excited , but not all ) .",
    "this communication does not cover the case of @xmath24 .",
    "our results do not contradict the results obtained by mccoy , since at @xmath25 , not only the excited states described by eq .",
    "( 5 ) but all possible excited states contribute to the correlation .",
    "thus , any state with energy @xmath31 would provide a contribution by an amount proportional to @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "if the states with exponentially decaying correlation be dominant , the resultant correlation will not be algebraic .    instead of calculating @xmath29 directly",
    ", we shall rather calculate the quantity ^z(n ) we shall see that for the excited states discussed in this paper ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) , @xmath34 so that @xmath35 is also zero and @xmath36 to evaluate the quantity @xmath37 for large @xmath0 , we note that this quantity can be expressed as an @xmath38 toeplitz determinant @xcite _ n ( ) |    ccccc g_0 & g_-1 & g_-2 & & g_-n+1 + g_1 & g_0 & g_-1 & & g_-n+2 + g_2 & g_1 & g_0 & & g_-n+3 + & & & & + g_n-1 & g_n-2 & g_n-3 & & g_0 +     @xcite has given the expression for @xmath39 in the ground state and there this integral is from 0 to @xmath20 .",
    "that expression has been modified here for the excited state following lieb , schultz and mattis @xcite .",
    "the standard prescription for studying the limiting ( @xmath40 ) behaviour of a toeplitz determinant is to apply szego s theorem in fisher - hartwig form @xcite .",
    "we shall also apply the same technique on the determinant given above .    in secs .",
    "ii and iii we treat the cases @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively and in sec .",
    "iv we present some discussions .",
    "we start this section with some analysis that is true both for @xmath41 and @xmath42 . the first step is to observe that the expression ( 8) for the elements @xmath39 of the determinant can be written as , g_m = _ 0 ^ 2 dk ( -imk ) c(k ) with the function @xmath43 ( called the generating function ) given by , c(k ) = \\ {    rl w & + -w & + w & +    . where w = it should be mentioned that this generating function is similar to that for the classical two - dimensional ising model @xcite apart from the finite jumps at @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "till now , whenever we have come across a square root ( eqs .",
    "( 3),(8),(11 ) ) we have tacitly adopted the convention ( like usual computer language compilers ) that we shall always take the numerically positive root .",
    "however , since later ( see eqs.(16 ) , ( 17 ) below ) we shall need to integrate the logarithm of the generating function from 0 to @xmath46 , let us choose , following the standard literature @xcite , the branch of square root for which this function is positive in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we write the surd in eq . ( 11 ) as w = and observe that we should take the negative root for @xmath42 and positive root for @xmath41 .",
    "let us call the generating function evaluated with this new convention as @xmath48 which is related to the @xmath43 of eq.(10 ) by ( k ) = \\ {    rl - c(k ) & + c(k ) &    .",
    "this @xmath48 when plugged in eq .",
    "( 9 ) leads to @xmath49 and the toeplitz determinant @xmath50 constructed from @xmath49 can be evaluated by applying szego s theorem on @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , this determinant is related to the @xmath51 of eq .",
    "( 7 ) by _ n ( ) = \\ {    rl ( -1)^n _ n ( ) & + _ n ( ) &    .",
    "the `` index '' of the generating function , defined as @xmath52\\ ] ] is 0 for @xmath41 but + 1 for @xmath42 .",
    "since szego s theorem can be directly applied only when the index is zero , our job is somewhat simpler for @xmath41 , compared to the same for @xmath42 .",
    "we shall be confined to the case of @xmath41 henceforth .",
    "the generating function for this case is , ( k ) = \\ {    rl w & + -w & + w & . +    .",
    "let us now investigate whether the conditions required ( other than zero index ) for szego s theorem to be valid are satisfied here or not . for @xmath53 ( ground state , all modes unexcited ) , one can make binomial expansion of the surd in @xmath54 ( eq . ( 11 ) ) and conclude that for any large positive integral value of @xmath55 ( with @xmath41 ) , _ m and _ -m since @xmath49 and @xmath56 both vanish exponentially with @xmath55 , the conditions , @xmath57 are valid . since @xmath58 for all values of @xmath18 , the hirshmann conditions @xcite for the validity of szego s theorem is satisfied .",
    "( however , it is not clear whether the devinatz condition @xcite , namely , the continuity of @xmath59 is true . ) for @xmath60 , the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath61 and @xmath62 depends on @xmath63 and @xmath30 and is not easy to track analytically .",
    "numerical study shows that both these quantities are oscillatory ( fig .  [",
    "fig : gm ] ) . the upper and lower envelopes of the oscillatory curve decay as @xmath64 for all @xmath63 and @xmath30 while the wavelength and amplitude of oscillation depends on the specific values of @xmath63 and @xmath30 .",
    "it is thus difficult to analyse the validity of hirshmann or devinatz condition here .",
    "we do not proceed further with the question of validity of the conditions for _ applicability _ of szego s theorem and rather choose to study the results obtained when we do apply the theorem anyway .",
    "to apply szego s theorem , the next step is to calculate the quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 defined as g_0 = _ 0 ^ 2 dk ( k ) g_m = _ 0 ^ 2 dk e^imk ( k ) , where @xmath55 is any positive integer .",
    "these quantities can be easily evaluated from eq .",
    "( 13 ) , but we must be careful to choose the principal branch for @xmath67 , satisfying @xmath68 this criterion is satisfied if we express the logarithm as , ( k ) = ik + + iwith the phase factor @xmath69    by expanding the logarithm on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 17a ) in a series and performing a term - by - term integration , we now get g_0 = 0 and g_m = .    next",
    ", we have to calculate the sum , = _",
    "m=1^ m g_m g_-m using the standard result @xcite _",
    "n=1^ a^m ( m ) = - ( 1 - 2 a + a^2 ) ( for @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) one obtains , @xmath72 the last sum is divergent . following the conjecture of fisher and hartwig @xcite , we replace the upper limit of the sum by @xmath73 to obtain _ m=1^n = _ e + ( n ) where @xmath74 is the euler s constant ( = 0.5772 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath75 is independent of @xmath63 , @xmath30 and @xmath0 .",
    "its numerical value could not be found analytically .",
    "szego s theorem now reads @xcite @xmath76 which , on substitution of the expressions of @xmath65 and @xmath77 leads to the final result c^z(n ) = _ n ( ) = , where @xmath78 .",
    "we have numerically evaluated this constant to be 0.590 ( which corresponds to @xmath79 ) by computing determinants upto a size of @xmath80 .",
    "the correlation function @xmath29 decays algebraically with distance without any oscillation .",
    "we shall now evaluate the toeplitz determinant of eq . ( 7 ) for @xmath42 .",
    "since the index of the generating function is not zero in this case ( as mentioned above ) , szego s theorem can not be applied directly .",
    "one has to follow instead the method of wu @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( 8) , the elements @xmath39 for some given value of @xmath63 is related to the same for @xmath81 by , g_m ( ) = g_-m+1 ( 1/ ) hence , the determinant for @xmath82 , can be written as , _",

    "we switch over to the convention that the root which ensures @xmath86 will be chosen and solve the wiener - hopf equations _",
    "m=0^n _ k - m(1/_0 ) _ m = _ k,0.the solution for @xmath87 as found by wu @xcite is _",

    "thus we have , _",
    "n = _ 0^ dk e^s where , = _",
    "m=1^ ( k-)m for large @xmath0 , the term @xmath94 oscillates rapidly and the non - trivial contribution to the integral comes only from the points where the rest of the integrand diverges .",
    "hence , it suffices to integrate only over a narrow region ( of width @xmath95 ) around the point @xmath96 and obtain _",
    "n = _ -^ ( nx+n ) e^s dx where we have taken the smoothly varying part out of the integration and put @xmath97 . following the fisher - hartwig conjecture , we now replace ( `` heuristically '' ) the upper limits in the sum @xmath98 ( see eq .",
    "( 33 ) ) by @xmath99 and note that for @xmath100 , we must have @xmath101 for all @xmath55 in the range of integration .",
    "the sum @xmath98 may then be approximated as = _ m=1^^n .",
    "substituting eq .",

    "this correlation function decays algebraically with distance and also oscillates with distance with wave - vector @xmath108 .",
    "before we conclude this section , we point out that although eq.(29 ) for @xmath87 as derived by wu @xcite is applicable here , there is a major difference between our case and the one studied by wu . in our case , @xmath85 does not vanish in the limit @xmath40 and all we want to evaluate is the zero - th order term in @xmath0 .",
    "but in wu s treatment , @xmath109 is zero and the basic job was to evaluate the leading terms for large @xmath0 .",
    "\\(i ) if we look at the spin - spin correlation in the ground state of transverse ising model , then we find that it is only for @xmath110 that the correlation decays algebraically with distance .",
    "but for the type of excited states we study ( see eq . ( 5 ) ) , the algebraic behaviour is seen over a larger range , namely , for @xmath41 as well as @xmath42 and any @xmath30 in the range @xmath111 .",
    "+ ( ii ) for handling the divergent sums that arise in the calculation of correlation function , fisher - hartwig prescription is very much useful for the excited states as it was for the ground state .",
    "actually , the index for algebraic decay can be derived from the generating function itself , without any further calculation .",
    "fisher and hartwig have shown that for generating function having multiple singularities , if @xmath112 $ ] jumps by an amount @xmath113 at the @xmath6-th singularity , then the determinant will decay algebraically with distance with an exponent @xmath114 . in our case , the generating function of eq .",
