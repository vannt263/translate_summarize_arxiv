    "josephson junctions involving majorana fermions@xcite are under intensive theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite investigation for the promising routes they provide towards demonstrating topological superconductivity@xcite and as potential building blocks towards topological quantum computation.@xcite in the most frequently studied class of systems , majorana fermions are nondegenerate zero - energy end states in hybrid devices realising one - dimensional ( 1d ) effectively spinless @xmath1-wave superconductors.@xcite a number of concrete platforms exist to realise this time - reversal symmetry breaking ( so - called class d@xcite ) topological superconductivity , all of which use the proximity effect to combine @xmath0-wave superconductors , strong spin - orbit coupling ( e.g. , via nanowires,@xcite topological insulators,@xcite or the superconductor itself@xcite ) and magnetic fields ( e.g. , via zeeman coupling@xcite or ferromagnetism@xcite ) .",
    "the past years have seen a rapidly increasing interest in realising@xcite and detecting@xcite time - reversal invariant ( so - called class diii@xcite ) analogues of such majorana fermion systems . in 1d ,",
    "class diii topological superconductors host a kramers pair of majorana fermions at each end which can be combined into a zero - energy fermion end mode with anomalous time - reversal properties.@xcite the proposed platforms for realisation again include hybrid devices based on spin - orbit coupling@xcite and the superconducting proximity effect,@xcite albeit now with unconventional ( but nontopological ) superconductors ( e.g. , iron - based superconductors with @xmath2-wave pairing@xcite ) . these hybrids",
    "realise spinful effectively @xmath1-wave pairing with the admixture of a smaller @xmath0-wave pairing component .     across the junction .",
    "the superconductors ( dark grey slabs ) each have a 1d , spin - orbit coupled quantum wire ( light grey blocks ) deposited on top of them . by the proximity effect , superconductivity is induced in each quantum wire .",
    "the wires with majorana - kramers pairs ( red and blue hemispheres ) display induced topological superconductivity , arising from coupling to unconventional ( e.g. , @xmath2-wave ) superconductors .",
    "the normal region ( e.g. , tunnel barrier , point contact , disordered metal ) between the superconductors is indicated by cross - hatching . ]    in this paper , we study josephson junctions involving 1d class diii topological superconductors .",
    "we obtain the energy spectrum and the consequent josephson current in terms of the normal - state scattering properties , requiring only that the junction be much shorter than the superconducting coherence length ( i.e. the short - junction limit ) .",
    "our results apply for a number of physically relevant situations including disordered junctions , or junctions of intermediate transparency that are away from both the tunnelling and the highly transparent limits considered in previous works.@xcite    we obtain results for two types of setups ( fig .",
    "[ fig : setups ] ) : junctions between two topological superconductors [ fig .",
    "[ fig : setups](a ) ] and junctions between an @xmath0-wave superconductor and a topological superconductor [ fig .",
    "[ fig : setups](b ) ] . for the first type of setup [ fig .",
    "[ fig : setups](a ) ] , we study the conditions under which a time - reversal invariant generalisation@xcite of the so - called fractional josephson effect@xcite can arise .",
    "this hallmark signature in class d topological superconductors refers to the appearance of a @xmath3 periodic current - phase relation , replacing the more conventional @xmath4 periodic one as majorana fermions enable charge transfer in terms of electrons instead of cooper pairs .",
    "in addition to establishing the form in which such behaviour can appear in class diii topological josephson junctions with generic junction properties , we also consider the role of the characteristic timescale for energy relaxation .",
    "the latter aspect , to the best of our knowledge , has not so far been considered ; however , as we show , it presents an important channel for the loss of @xmath3 periodicity .    for the second type of setup [ fig .",
    "[ fig : setups](b ) ] , we investigate how the anomalous time - reversal properties of the fermion @xmath5 , built from the two interface majoranas , appear in the features of the josephson current . here",
    "general considerations@xcite show that there is an anomalous , time - reversal protected contribution that gives nonzero current at @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is integer ) with sign set by the parity of @xmath5 . to positively establish the origin of this contribution in an experimental system ( e.g. , that the current at @xmath6 is not due to broken time - reversal invariance@xcite ) , however , a theory for the current - phase relationship is needed that accounts for other , nonanomalous contributions and which holds for generic junctions",
    ". such a theory may also be useful in scenarios where access to changes in @xmath8 are more readily available than to @xmath8 itself ; for example , the ac josephson effect where the phase sweep speed is controlled by the voltage across the junction ( i.e. @xmath9 ) . in this paper",
    "we provide such a theory .",
    "the signatures mentioned above are for junctions with a conserved fermion parity .",
    "we also investigate , for both setups , the case where the fermion parity is allowed to relax ( i.e. the dc josephson effect regime ) .",
    "for all the regimes to be considered , we compare topological junctions to their nontopological counterparts ( i.e. without majorana fermions ) in order to search for unique signatures of topological superconductivity .",

    "[ sec : concl ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in mean field theory , the excitations of superconductor systems can be described in an effectively single - particle picture in terms of the so - called bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian,@xcite which is a @xmath10 matrix in electron - hole space @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the single - particle hamiltonians for electrons and holes , respectively , and @xmath14 is the superconducting pair potential . each of the blocks of eq .",

    "this choice of @xmath13 corresponds to a basis which makes spin - rotation properties manifest : in a spin - rotation symmetric system , all blocks of @xmath20 are proportional to the identity matrix in spin - space .",
    "a josephson junction is composed of two superconductors linked together by a normal region with a phase difference @xmath8 across the junction .",
    "we will describe such junctions , with normal regions @xmath21 , using the step - function model@xcite @xmath22    to describe topological superconductors in our setups , we focus on the case where @xmath12 describes a spinful system that is , at least in the superconductors and at the normal - superconductor interfaces , effectively 1d ( e.g. , the spin - orbit coupled nanowire in the hybrid proposals@xcite ) with a single conducting channel .",
    "the two spin components give rise to two right - moving and two left - moving fermi points .",
    "class diii topological superconductivity arises@xcite when the spectrum acquires superconducting gaps @xmath23 of opposite signs at the two right - moving fermi points .",
    "the gaps at the left - moving pair of fermi points follow by time - reversal symmetry . for our purposes , it is sufficient to focus on the physics in the vicinity of the fermi points . in this case , in addition to spin",
    ", @xmath12 acquires a further @xmath24 block structure for left- and right - movers .",
    "we have    @xmath25    [ eq : hbdglin ]    where the entries are ordered from the rightmost to the leftmost fermi point . in eq .  , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the fermi velocities where the upper sign refers to the electron hamiltonian and the lower to the hole hamiltonian . in eq .",
    ", @xmath28 refers to the left / right superconductor and , without loss of generality , we will take @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , by parameterising the pairings as @xmath30 , the system can be viewed as having a time - reversal invariant @xmath1-wave pairing @xmath31 with the admixture of a smaller @xmath0-wave pairing @xmath32 . in line with a number of concrete proposals describing systems conserving the @xmath33-component of spin",

    "( the complementary spin-@xmath36 quantities follow via time - reversal . )",
    "the hamiltonian   is , however , more general and holds in the absence of a conserved spin component ; it can be used to describe the superconductors in both setups we consider . for the topological  topological junction",
    ", we consider the gap - symmetric case @xmath37 , while for the @xmath0-wave  topological junction we impose no such requirement .",
    "for nontopological , singlet superconductor based , josephson junctions in the short - junction limit , time - reversal invariance is known to allow for elegant relations to the normal - state scattering properties,@xcite such as beenakker s formula for @xmath0-wave junctions@xcite @xmath38 expressing the andreev ( i.e. subgap ) bound state energies in terms of the normal - state transmission probability @xmath39 at the fermi energy . as we show below ,",
    "a number of analogous exact relations exist in the topological case .",
    "the starting point for establishing these are the andreev reflection matrices at normal ( topological ) superconductor interfaces",
    ".      excitations with energies below the superconducting gap can be described in terms of andreev reflections at the superconductor / normal ( sn ) interfaces .",
    "these andreev reflections are described by the andreev reflection matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which respectively contain amplitudes for a hole reflecting into an electron and vice versa .",
    "we now use eq .   as a starting point to derive the andreev reflection matrices at sn interfaces , which will serve as key ingredients for formulating the scattering matrix description of our systems .",
    "the superconductors are 1d , forming single transport channels which carry electrons and holes of a particular spin , leading to four subchannels overall .",
    "the key assumption that we make is that the four electron - hole dirac cones at the four fermi points remain uncoupled for clean sn interfaces .",
    "this so - called andreev approximation@xcite holds when the superconducting coherence length is much longer than the inverse of the separation between neighbouring fermi points or , when the bulk superconducting system conserves a spin component , between the left- and right - moving fermi points .",
    "the approach to deriving the andreev reflection matrices is essentially the same as for josephson junction composed of @xmath0-wave superconductors , as treated by beenakker.@xcite the andreev reflection matrices take the form @xmath42 where we have introduced the subblocks @xmath43 with @xmath44      the scattering of electrons and holes about the normal region is described by the scattering matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "together these matrices must obey certain symmetry relations as a result of the structure of the hamiltonian  .",
    "the first relation that must be satisfied as a consequence of particle - hole symmetry is @xmath47 the second relation that must be satisfied due to time - reversal invariance is @xmath48    the elements of @xmath49 change on the scale of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the dwell time in the junction . in terms of @xmath51 and @xmath14",
    ", the short - junction limit requires @xmath52 . since we will consider energies on the scale of a few @xmath14 or less , the energy dependence of the scattering matrix @xmath49 may be neglected,@xcite allowing us to take the scattering matrix at the fermi level @xmath53 .",
    "the electron subblock of the scattering matrix has the general form @xmath54 and , upon using time - reversal symmetry [ eq .  ] in the single channel case of interest , we can parameterise@xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are complex numbers .",

    "furthermore , due to the unitarity of @xmath45 , we have the following identity @xmath66    at this point , we are now ready to consider specific junction setups and how the andreev energies may be obtained .",
    "the scattering processes described in the previous section lead to andreev bound states in the normal region of the josephson junction , where the bound states have a spectrum of energies dependent on @xmath8 .",
