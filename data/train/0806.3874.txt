    "polynomial equations play a crucial role in mathematics and are widely used in an emerging number of modern applications .",
    "recent years have witnessed a new trend in algebraic geometry and polynomial system , namely numerical polynomial algebra  @xcite or numerical algebraic geometry  @xcite .",
    "algorithms in this field deal with the problem of ( approximately ) computing objects of interest in the classical area of algebraic geometry with a focus on polynomial root finding .",
    "there is a broad literature for the problem of computing complex roots , that deals with numerical and symbolic algorithms , ranging from numerical continuation methods as in e.g. verschelde  @xcite to exact methods as in e.g. rouillier @xcite , or more general grbner or border bases methods ; see e.g. the monograph @xcite and the references therein .    in many practical applications ,",
    "one is only interested in the _ real _ solutions of a system of polynomial equations , possibly satisfying additional polynomial inequality constraints .",
    "an obvious approach for finding all real roots of a system of polynomial equations is to first compute all complex solutions , i.e. , the algebraic variety @xmath2 of the associated ideal @xmath6 $ ] , and then to sort the real variety @xmath7 from @xmath2 afterwards .",
    "however , in many practical instances , the number of real roots is considerably smaller than the total number of roots and , in some cases , it is finite while @xmath8 .",
    "the literature about algorithms tailored to the problem of real solving systems of polynomial equations is by far not as broad as for the problem of computing complex roots .",
    "often local newton type methods or subdivision methods based on descartes rule of sign , on sturm - habicht sequences or on hermite quadratic forms are used ; see e.g.  @xcite for a discussion . in @xcite we gave an algorithm for finding @xmath9 ( assumed to be finite ) , and a semidefinite characterization as well as a border ( or grbner ) basis of the real radical ideal @xmath5i$ ] , by using linear algebra combined with semidefinite programming ( sdp ) techniques .",
    "we exploited the fact that all information needed to compute the above objects is contained in the so - called moment matrix ( whose entries depend on the polynomials generating the ideal @xmath4 ) and the geometry behind when this matrix is required to be positive semidefinite with maximum rank . we use the name _",
    "( real - root ) moment - matrix algorithm _ for the algorithm proposed in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was later extended to the computation of all complex roots in @xcite .",
    "a feature of the real - root moment - matrix algorithm is that it requires to solve a sequence of sdp problems involving matrices of increasing size until a certain rank condition is satisfied .",
    "solving the sdp problem is the computationally most demanding task in the algorithm .",
    "it is thus important to be able to terminate the algorithm at an as early as possible stage so that the size of the matrices does not grow too much .",
    "this is the motivation for the present paper where we present a new stopping condition , which is satisfied at least as early as the rank condition of @xcite ( and often earlier on examples ) .",
    "this leads to a new algorithm which we name _ ( real - root ) prolongation - projection algorithm _ since its stopping condition involves computing the dimensions of projections of certain sets of linear functionals on spaces of polynomials .",
    "this new algorithm arises by incorporating several ideas of @xcite into an existing symbolic - numeric solver dedicated to compute @xmath2 ( as described e.g. in  @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed description will be given in section [ sec::algorithm ] but , in order to ease comparison with the moment - matrix method of @xcite , we now give a brief sketch of both methods .      while methods based on grbner bases work with the ( primal ) ring of polynomials @xmath3}$ ] , its ideals and their associated quotient spaces , we follow a dual approach here . the algorithms proposed in @xcite and in this work",

    "say we want to compute the ( finite ) real variety @xmath0 of an ideal @xmath4 given by a set of generators @xmath15}$ ] with maximum degree @xmath16 .",
    "a common step in both methods is to compute a maximum rank moment matrix @xmath17 , where @xmath14}_t)^*$ ] vanishes on the set @xmath18 of all prolongations up to degree @xmath11 of the polynomials @xmath19 ; this step is carried out with a numerical algorithm for semidefinite optimization . from that point on both methods",
    "use distinct strategies . in the moment - matrix method one",
    "checks whether the rank condition : @xmath20 holds for some @xmath21 ; if so , then one can conclude that @xmath5i$ ] is generated by the polynomials in the kernel of @xmath22 and extract @xmath0 ; if not , iterate with @xmath23 . in the prolongation - projection algorithm",
    ", one considers @xmath24 , the set obtained by adding to @xmath18 prolongations of the polynomials in the kernel of @xmath17 , its border @xmath25 , as well as the set @xmath26 of linear functionals on @xmath3}_t$ ] vanishing on @xmath24 , and its projections @xmath27 on various degrees @xmath28 .",
    "we give conditions on the dimension of these linear subspaces ensuring the computation of the real variety @xmath0 and generators for the real radical ideal @xmath5i$ ] .",
    "namely , if @xmath29 holds for some @xmath30 , then one can compute an ideal @xmath31 nested between @xmath4 and @xmath32i$ ] so that @xmath33 , with equality @xmath34i$ ] if @xmath35 ; if not , iterate with @xmath23 .",
    "both algorithms are tailored to finding real roots and terminate assuming @xmath0 finite ( while @xmath2 could be infinite ) . however , the order @xmath11 at which the dimension condition holds is at most the order at which the rank condition holds .",
    "hence the prolongation - projection algorithm terminates earlier than the moment - matrix method , which often permits to save some semidefinite optimization step with a larger moment matrix ( as shown on a few examples in section [ sec::numexamples ] ) .",
    "section [ sec::preliminaries ] provides some basic background on polynomial ideals and moment matrices whereas section [ sec::principles ] presents the basic principles behind the prolongation - projection method and theorem  [ theozr ] , our main result , provides a new stopping criterion for the computation of @xmath0 .",
    "section [ sec::links ] relates the prolongation - projection algorithm to the moment - matrix method of  @xcite .",
    "in particular , proposition [ prop2 ] shows that the rank condition used as stopping criterion in the moment - matrix method is equivalent to a strong version of the new stopping criterion ; as a consequence the new criterion is satisfied at least as early as the rank condition ( corollary [ corlink ] ) .",
