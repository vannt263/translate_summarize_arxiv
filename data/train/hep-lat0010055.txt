    "much of the experimental relevance of finite temperature qcd comes from non - equilibrium situations , as in the case of heavy ion collisions .",
    "current lattice techniques are restricted to equilibrium simulations , and can not address directly non - equilibrium time evolution . however , there are aspects of non - equilibrium behavior that are determined by the equilibrium effective potential . after a rapid change in temperature , induced by some external agency ,",
    "it is the effective potential that determines the process of re - equilibration , in particular whether relaxation , nucleation or spinodal decomposition is the dominant equilibration mechanism .",
    "we have shown that a large , rapid increase of temperature across the deconfinement temperature results in spinodal decomposition in pure @xmath5 and @xmath6 gauge theories.@xcite in particular , we have found the existence of exponentially growing long wavelength modes in the approach to equilibrium , characteristic of spindodal decomposition.@xcite@xcite this behavior depends only on the features of the equilibrium effective action in an unstable region .",
    "we consider first the generic case of a pure @xmath8 gauge theory in which the temperature is raised rapidly from a temperature less than @xmath9 , the deconfinement temperature , to a temperature above @xmath9 .",
    "we refer to such a rapid increase in system temperature as a quench , a borrowing of nomenclature from condensed matter physics .",

    "the use of the variable @xmath22 makes the @xmath23 symmetry of the potential under @xmath24manifest .",
    "note that the equilibrium value of @xmath22 is @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath26 ; @xmath27 , corresponding to @xmath28 , is a maximum of @xmath29 .",
    "our picture of the quenching process is that the system is initially in a state where @xmath30is equal to zero at some temperature below @xmath9 .",
    "when the system is quickly raised to a new temperature @xmath31 , the system is still in the state with @xmath27 .",
    "however , the system is unstable , and must eventually find its way to either @xmath32or @xmath33 . because we quench into a region of the phase diagram where @xmath34 , the system will decay to the equilibrium state via spinodal decomposition .    because pure @xmath5 gauge theory has a second - order deconfining transition ,",
    "spinodal decomposition will occur after quenching to any temperature @xmath35 .",
    "the situation is more subtle for @xmath6 , where the deconfinement phase transition is first order .",
    "this implies the existence of a metastable confined phase for some range of temperatures above @xmath0 , which in turn implies that nucleation is the dominant equilibration mechanism just above @xmath0 .",

    "lattices of size @xmath52 and @xmath53 were equilibrated at @xmath54 , below the deconfinement transition at @xmath55.@xcite the coupling constant was increased instantaneously to @xmath56 , and the approach to equilibrium monitored via the polyakov loop and other observables .",
    "the heat bath algorithm was used both for equilibration at low temperature before the quench and for subsequent dynamical evolution after the quench .",
    "while this time evolution is not the true time evolution of the non - equilibrium quantum field theory , features such as spinodal decomposition which depend only on the equilibrium effective action will occur with any local updating algorithm which converges to the equilibrium distribution .",
    "the abrupt change in @xmath57 is a potential cause of concern with this procedure , since the lattice spacing , and hence the physical volume , changes in all directions when @xmath57 is changed .",

    "the growth rate of each line is proportional to @xmath65 for the linearized theory , but this may not represent the true time evolution of the simulation . in any case , the growth rates measured in each run are highly dependent on initial conditions . in figure 2 , we plot these growth rates versus @xmath66 for the same run used in figure 1 .",

    "we have begun studies of the more physically relevant case of @xmath6 .",
    "since nucleation dominates at temperatures just above @xmath0 , it is necessary to go to higher temperatures to observe spinodal decomposition . working with @xmath52 lattice configurations equilibrated at @xmath77 , we performed quenches to various values of @xmath78 .",

    "determination of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath79 will allow us to define the limit of metastability as the point @xmath83",
    ". note that small values of @xmath3 require correspondingly large lattice sizes to see non - zero exponentially growing modes .    just as the formation of a dcc@xcite may lead to enhanced production of low - momentum pions ,",
    "spinodal decomposition could lead to enhanced production of low - momentum gluons in the early stages of plasma formation .",
    "the characteristic scale for such a phenomenon would be @xmath84 .",
