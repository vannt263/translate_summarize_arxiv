    "one prime motivation of high energy research into active galactic nuclei is to find evidence for the putative massive black hole , through the gravitational redshift imparted on photons emerging within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon . to date , most of the effort has focused on the iron k@xmath0 emission line , predicted to show a relativistically broadened profile @xcite , which appeared to be common among seyfert 1 galaxies , as observed by asca @xcite .",
    "however the situation emerging from the newer xmm - newton and chandra data is more ambiguous , the spectra showing that narrower ( non - relativistic ) lines are commonplace @xcite .",
    "indeed the red - wing of the broad iron line is often hard to distinguish from the effects of the warm absorber @xcite .    given the ambiguity in modeling the broad iron line , additional diagnostics of the inner disk material are needed .",
    "narrow , transient and redshifted iron emission lines of modest statistical significance have recently been claimed in several agn @xcite possibly originating from local hot - spots on the disk surface . potentially these lines can be tracked to reveal orbital motions in the inner disk @xcite .",
    "however little evidence has been found to date for infall of matter onto the black hole . in this paper , we present evidence of highly redshifted iron k@xmath0 absorption lines in the narrow - line seyfert 1 , pg1211 + 143  with chandra letg .",
    "this may either be interpreted as infall onto the massive black hole , or gravitational redshift occurring within @xmath3 of a kerr black hole .",
    "pg1211 + 143  ( at z=0.0809 ) is a prototypical ` big blue bump ' quasar , and one of the brightest agn in the soft x - ray band @xcite .",
    "a previous xmm - newton observation of pg1211 + 143  showed blue - shifted absorption from a high velocity ( @xmath4 ) outflow @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray properties of pg1211 + 143 , which confirm the blue - shifted absorber , will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "values of h@xmath5=70kms@xmath6mpc@xmath6 , @xmath7=0.0 and @xmath8 are assumed and errors are quoted at 90% confidence ( @xmath9 ) , for 1 parameter of interest .",
    "pg 1211 + 143 was observed by chandra with the low energy transmission grating ( letg ) in 3 consecutive orbits between 21 june 2004 and 26 june 2004 of approximately 45ks exposure per orbit ( see table 1 ) .",
    "an xmm - newton observation was conducted simultaneously with the first chandra orbit , but due to high and variable background , this was reduced to only @xmath1020ks useful exposure .",
    "the acis - s detector was used on the focal plane , with the s3 chip being at the telescope aimpoint .",
    "chandra letg source spectra , background spectra and response matrices were generated using ciao 3.2.1 .",
    "streaks were removed from the acis - s ccd array , while events with grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were selected . after screening an exposure of 133.6 ks was obtained .",
    "spectra and responses from the @xmath11 orders were extracted and combined to maximize signal to noise .",
    "the time - averaged combined first order letg count rate was 0.31 counts  s@xmath6 .",
    "data from the zeroth order image were not used , due to photon pile - up .",
    "the 1st order spectra were binned so that one bin represents the fwhm resolution of the letg ( @xmath12 ) , ensuring sufficient counts per bin to use the @xmath13 minimization spectral fitting technique .",
    "to parameterize the x - ray continuum , the letg spectrum was fitted with a broken power - law model , modified by neutral galactic absorption of @xmath14  @xmath15 @xcite , over the 0.4 - 8.0 kev bandpass .",
    "the soft and hard x - ray photon indices , break energy and model normalization were allowed to vary ; the best fit values are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , break energy @xmath18  kev and normalized flux of @xmath19  photons  kev@xmath6  @xmath15  s@xmath6 ( at 1 kev ) .",
    "the integrated flux is @xmath20  erg  @xmath15  s@xmath6 ( 0.4 - 8kev ) , corresponding to an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of @xmath21  erg  s@xmath6 .",
    "the spectral fit obtained is formally unacceptable , with @xmath22 ( dof = degrees of freedom ) for a rejection probability of @xmath23 .",
    "this is due to several ionized emission and absorption lines ( e.g. from o , ne ) below 1 kev , although the continuum is fitted well above 2 kev .",
    "a subsequent paper will describe the soft x - ray spectrum of pg1211 + 143  obtained with the letg ( reeves et al . 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the spectrum in the iron k band above 2 kev .",
    "a single power - law model provides an adequate fit to the continuum above 2 kev , with a photon index of @xmath24 .",
    "the fit statistic obtained is @xmath25 , which is marginally acceptable ( the rejection probability is @xmath26 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the letg counts spectrum above 2 kev , the lower panel showing the @xmath13 residuals of the data compared to the continuum model .",
    "each bin represents the fwhm resolution of the letg .",
    "two strong negative deviations that contribute significantly towards the total @xmath13 are observed near 4.2 and 4.9 kev , due to two absorption lines in the pg1211 + 143  spectrum . to test this , two unresolved",
    "( @xmath27  ev ) gaussian absorption lines were added to the continuum model .",
    "a significant improvement in the spectral fit was obtained ( @xmath28 ) , with addition of two absorption lines at @xmath29  kev and @xmath30  kev ( observed frame ) with equivalent widths of @xmath31  ev and @xmath32  ev .",
    "the improvement in fit statistic upon adding each line was @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , while the overall fit statistic is now acceptable .    to constrain the width of the two absorption lines ,",
    "the letg spectrum was rebinned to their maximum resolution , with each bin representing 1/4 fwhm resolution of the letg ( @xmath35  or @xmath36  ev at 4 kev ) .",
    "the rest - frame spectrum at this resolution near the absorption lines is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the spectral fit was minimized using the c - statistic @xcite , due to the lower number of counts per bin at this resolution .",
    "the best fit width is @xmath37ev ( at 4.9 kev ) , corresponding to a fwhm velocity of @xmath38kms@xmath6 .",
    "however the line width is poorly constrained , the 90% upper limit being @xmath39kms@xmath6 .",
    "the variability of the absorption lines was tested by comparing the letg spectra across all three chandra orbits .",
    "the first letg orbit was simultaneous with xmm - newton , so the letg and epic - pn spectra were fitted jointly .",
    "the results are shown in table  1 , while the c - statistic was used to minimize the spectral fits .",
    "the 4.2 and 4.9 kev lines are only formally detected during the 2nd orbit , although orbits 2 and 3 are statistically consistent .",
    "the lines do appear to vary in equivalent width between orbits 1 and 2 at @xmath40 confidence .      in order to check that the absorption is not due to calibration effects , the pg1211 + 143  spectrum was compared to all the archived letg observations of 3c273 .",
    "no residuals are present in the summed or individual 3c273 spectra near the line energies 4.22kev and 4.93kev ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the limit on the equivalent width of any absorption lines is @xmath41  ev in the summed spectrum .",
    "the source and background spectral extraction regions of pg1211 + 143 , in each of the three chandra orbits , were also inspected .",
    "no anomalous pixels or rows were observed in the ccd array and no background sources were present within the extraction regions .",
    "the separate @xmath11 order spectra of pg1211 + 143   were also found to be consistent .",
    "thus the lines are not due to systematic or calibration effects in the letg . in order to assess the statistical significance of the lines , we wish to determine the chance probability of falsely detecting two lines , over an energy band of interest . in order to estimate this ,",
    "1000 letg spectra were simulated , under the null hypothesis assumption that the spectrum consists of a broken power - law continuum from 0.4 - 8.0kev , with no spectral lines .",
    "the distribution of @xmath42 values obtained by fitting a single gaussian line to each of the 1000 spectra simulated in the null hypothesis case can then be compared to the measured @xmath42 in the real dataset to calculate the false probability of detection @xcite .",
    "the 1st order letg spectra were simulated using identical continuum parameters and exposure as in the real pg1211 + 143  dataset and binned at the fwhm resolution of the letg .",
    "a single narrow gaussian line ( either in absorption or emission ) was added to the continuum model and then fitted to each simulated spectrum .",
    "the line energy was stepped in increments of one fwhm resolution bin over the 37 kev band and the simulated spectrum was re - fitted at each increment to minimize @xmath13 .",
    "the minimum @xmath13 obtained from adding the line to the spectral fit was compared to the @xmath13 obtained for the continuum model alone for each spectrum , in order to compute the distribution of @xmath42 versus probability for all 1000 simulated spectra .",
    "the 37 kev band was chosen for the line search as it is most likely that a strong iron k@xmath0 line will be observed over this energy range ; i.e. @xmath43kev is outside the iron k band - pass for any feasible redshift , while the letg has little effective area above 7 kev .",
    "the improvement in fit statistic obtained for adding the two lines to the actual dataset was @xmath33 and @xmath34 for each line .",
    "the simulations show that the false probability of detecting a line with equal or greater @xmath42 is 0.034 and 0.004 for the 4.2 and 4.9kev lines respectively .",
    "the probability of both lines being false detections is the product of these probabilities , which is @xmath1 .    as an independent check ,",
    "we calculate the line significances using the actual errors on the fitted parameters .",
    "the absorption line fluxes at 4.2 and 4.9kev are @xmath44photons@xmath15s@xmath6 and @xmath45photons@xmath15s@xmath6 respectively , while the continuum fluxes at these energies are @xmath46photons@xmath15s@xmath6kev@xmath6 and @xmath47photons@xmath15s@xmath6kev@xmath6 .",
    "the equivalent widths of the lines are then @xmath48ev and @xmath49ev respectively .",
    "the errors are @xmath50 values and the line flux and continuum errors have been propogated .",
    "thus the two absorption lines are significant at @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with corresponding null probabilities of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "however these are single trial probabilities for a line at an a - priori known energy . taking into account the number of bins @xmath55 searched for line features in the 3 - 7 kev range ,",
    "then the null detection probability @xmath56 will be @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the single trial probability from above . as there are 48 resolution bins in the 3 - 7 kev range , the null probabilities for the 4.2 and 4.9kev lines are 0.022 and 0.0067 respectively , in excellent agreement with the monte - carlo estimates .",
    "two absorption lines are observed at 4.22 and 4.93kev in the pg1211 + 143  letg spectrum , with a low probability that both are false detections .",
    "although the lines are likely to be associated with redshifted fe k@xmath0 , we first consider whether the lines could originate from other elements at lower velocities .",
    "the absorption line rest frame energies are @xmath59  kev and @xmath60  kev .",
    "the closest transitions to those energies are sc  xxi k@xmath0 ( at 4.53kev ) or v  xxiii ( 5.43kev ) respectively .",
    "the abundances of sc or v are extremely low , @xmath61 less than fe .",
    "even if the abundances of were enhanced through spallation of iron nuclei by energetic protons on the disk surface @xcite , the strengths of these lines would still be considerably weaker ( @xmath62 ) than due to fe k@xmath0 .",
    "one other possibility is that the absorption originates from lower z elements such as si , s or ca in a relativistic outflow .",
    "blue - shifted lines with @xmath4 have been detected in pg1211 + 143  in a previous xmm - newton observation by @xcite . in this case",
    "ca  xx at 4.10 kev would appear the most reasonable identification for the lower energy line , requiring an outflow velocity of 32000kms@xmath6 .",
    "however the ca  xx line is still likely to be weak , as the abundance ratio is @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "si or s are more abundant than ca , however if the lines originate from si  xiv k@xmath0 and s  xvi k@xmath0 , then the outflow velocities are 0.68c and 0.62c respectively .",
    "the kinetic power of such a fast flow would be a factor of @xmath64 greater than calculated by @xcite , probably exceeding @xmath65  erg  s@xmath6 and the bolometric output of the quasar .",
    "such a highly energetic flow seems implausible , unless the opening angle of the outflow is small .",
    "the most likely scenario is that the lines originate from highly redshifted iron k@xmath0 .",
    "indeed there have been a small number of previous claims of redshifted fe k absorption lines in other agn .",
    "@xcite first claimed the possibility of redshifted iron k - shell absorption , through _ asca _",
    "observations of the seyfert 1 ngc 3516 .",
    "however recent chandra and xmm - newton observations @xcite have showed that this is probably due to a strong narrow k@xmath0 core at 6.4kev and variable emission lines at @xmath66kev .",
    "other claimed examples include a 6.2 kev line in the quasar 1e1821 + 643 with chandra hetg @xcite and a weak redshifted line in the quasar q 0056 - 363 @xcite .",
    "most recently the detection of transient redshifted fe absorption lines in mrk 509 was claimed in beppo - sax data , with a velocity shift of @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "if the lines in pg1211 + 143  correspond to h - like iron ( i.e. fe  xxvi k@xmath0 at 6.97 kev ) then the redshifted velocities are 0.26c and 0.40c , while if the lines correspond to he - like iron ( fe  xxv k@xmath0 resonance at 6.70kev ) , the velocities are 0.22c and 0.37c .",
    "note that the separation of the two lines requires two distinct velocity components , as the higher order fe k@xmath68 lines are undetectable in this spectrum .",
    "it is unlikely that the lines result from a lower ionization than fe  xxv , as then a series of strong l - shell fe lines and edges would be detected at lower energies , which is not the case .",
    "furthermore the absorption lines can not be from near neutral fe ( fe  i - xvii ) at 6.4 kev , because no strong k@xmath0 absorption line would be observed , as the l - shell would be fully populated .",
    "the two possible causes for the relativistic shifts are either gravitational redshift of photons near the massive black hole or infall of matter onto the black hole . in the former scenario ,",
    "the absorbing matter would have to be located at @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively from a schwarzschild black hole ( where @xmath71 is one gravitational radius ) .",
    "this is within the last stable orbit around a schwarzschild black hole and requires a kerr metric @xcite for the matter to exist in a stable orbit within @xmath2 . for a maximal pole - on kerr black hole ,",
    "the radii derived are then @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "alternatively , the matter may be infalling onto the black hole , in which case a maximum velocity of @xmath74 ( in the frame of the observer ) can be achieved at @xmath2 for a schwarzschild metric .",
    "modeling the two absorption line systems with xstar @xcite , requires a large column density of @xmath75  @xmath15 ( assuming a turbulence of @xmath76kms@xmath6 and solar abundances ) .",
    "the ionization parameter is log@xmath77  erg  cm  s@xmath6 , with most of the absorption arising from fe  xxvi k@xmath0 . the equivalent column density of fe  xxvi is @xmath78@xmath15 , while the optical depth at the k - shell edge is @xmath79 , i.e. the matter is optically - thin to the continuum .",
    "the velocity of the two absorption systems are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , while the line of sight covering fraction is @xmath82% . from the above parameters we can derive the physical properties of the gas .",
    "a black hole mass of @xmath83   is assumed @xcite , an ionizing luminosity of @xmath84  erg  s@xmath6 and a radial distance of @xmath85 cm ( i.e. a few @xmath86 ) .",
    "the ionization parameter is defined as @xmath87 ( n is the electron density ) , while one can define a filling factor @xmath88 as @xmath89 .",
    "a density of @xmath90@xmath91 is calculated , with a filling factor of @xmath101% and a cloud size of @xmath92 cm .",
    "note that these should be considered order of magnitude estimates , due to the uncertainties in @xmath93 and black hole mass .",
    "the matter may be clumped , perhaps from density perturbations on the disk or from localized filaments within the infalling matter .",
    "a fast outflow of @xmath94 has already been detected in an earlier xmm - newton observation of pg1211 + 143  @xcite which is confirmed from the analysis of the soft x - ray letg data ( reeves et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "one possibility is that part of this outflow does not escape the gravitational potential of the black hole @xcite . if material is launched with @xmath95 in pg1211 + 143 , then matter within a radius of @xmath96 may not escape the system .",
    "thus it is possible to produce both red and blue - shifted lines in pg1211 + 143 , indeed in mrk 509 both inflow and outflow also appear to be present @xcite . from above",
    ", the mass infall rate required is @xmath97gs@xmath6 or @xmath98yr@xmath6 .",
    "the kinetic power is then a few  @xmath99  erg  s@xmath6 for an infall velocity of @xmath100 .",
    "interestingly this is similar to the x - ray luminosity of pg1211 + 143 . indeed",
    "a similar `` aborted jet '' model has been proposed by @xcite , where matter in an outflow or jet fails to escape the gravitational potential well .",
    "the hard x - ray emission can be produced by shocks and collisions within the flow .",
    "alternatively the absorption may originate from matter near the highly ionized inner disk surface , with the redshift being largely gravitational in origin .",
    "@xcite proposed such a model to explain the absorption line in ngc 3516 , although the lines will be broad unless the matter is clumped .",
    "monitoring the line variability will help to reveal its origin , for instance it may possible to track the infall of a dense clump of matter towards the black hole .",
    "this bodes well for future longer observations of pg1211 + 143 , with xmm - newton or chandra , to track the line variability .",
    "regardless of the mechanism , the large redshift and high covering fraction imply that most of the x - ray emission in pg1211 + 143  originates from a compact region within a few @xmath86 of the black hole .",
