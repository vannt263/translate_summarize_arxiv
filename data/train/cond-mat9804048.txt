    "lattice models of loops have emerged as an important paradigm in two - dimensional critical phenomena .",
    "they allow for a determination of the scaling properties of different types of random walks which are used to model conformations of different phases of polymers@xcite .",
    "for instance , the solution of the o(@xmath5 ) loop model has lead to exact results for conformational exponents of swollen and dense polymers @xcite , as well as polymers at the theta point @xcite .",
    "the theta point is the tricritical point which governs the transition between the swollen and the collapsed phase of polymers in solution @xcite .",
    "examples of conformational exponents are @xmath1 , which describes the scaling of the number of polymer conformations with the number of monomers @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , for the scaling of the linear size of a polymer , as measured by the radius of gyration , with @xmath6 . here",
    "we calculate for the first time the exact value of @xmath1 for polymers on the square lattice , in the _ compact phase_. compact polymers completely fill the lattice and are of direct relevance to statistical studies of protein folding @xcite .",
    "further motivation for studying loop models comes from the fortuin - kasteleyn construction which maps many discrete spin models ( e.g. , @xmath8-state potts ) to random cluster models .",
    "since cluster boundaries in two dimensions form loops this naturally leads to a loop model representation .",
    "this random geometrical description of two - dimensional lattice models then provides a setting in which a general theory of their scaling limits can be sought .",
    "it is one of the goals of this paper to outline a specific proposal for such a theory in the form of an effective field theory of fluctuating loops .",
    "this field theory is constructed following the coulomb gas recipe @xcite with some important new ingredients added @xcite .",
    "it describes the fluctuations of a random surface for which the loops are contour lines .    scaling limits of many ( but not all ) two - dimensional lattice models are described by conformally invariant field theories @xcite .",
    "this observation has lead to exact results for critical exponents and other universal quantities , and to a classification of critical points based on their symmetry properties with respect to the group of conformal transformations .",
    "an obvious question which is often difficult to answer is : given a particular lattice model how does one _ construct _ the conformal field theory of its scaling limit ?",
    "loop models provide examples for which the scaling limit can be constructed in a _ physically _ transparent way .",
    "this is accomplished by mapping a loop model to an interface model , where the loops are simply equal - height contours .",
    "an explicit coarse graining procedure is then implemented for the height model , and it leads to a well known conformal field theory  the _ liouville field theory_.    interesting examples of loop models are also provided by one - dimensional quantum models , spin chains in particular , where loops appear as world lines of the spin .",
    "this mapping of spins to loops has recently been used to formulate very efficient numerical schemes for simulating spin chains and ladders .",
    "these _ loop algorithms _ allow one to simulate much bigger system sizes and lower temperatures than by using more traditional algorithms with local updates @xcite .",
    "the loop representation of quantum spin chains also gives an illuminating stochastic - geometrical view of their quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "for example , the spin - spin correlation function is related to the probability that two points on the space - time lattice belong to the same loop .",
    "this insight might lead to a _",
    "practical _ theory of plateau transitions in the integer quantum hall effect , i.  e. , one that would allow for a calculation of the correlation length exponent and other universal quantities which have been measured in experiments .",
    "namely , the chalker - coddington network model @xcite , which is believed to be in the same universality class as the plateau transitions , was recently mapped to an @xmath9 quantum spin chain @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if this spin chain has a tractable loop - model representation .",
    "in the bigger picture , loop models are of interest as simple examples where the fundamental constituents are non - local , extended objects as opposed to point - like objects such as particles and spins . fluctuating geometries of this sort are used to model flux lines in superconductors , domain walls in magnets , and crystalline interfaces , to name a few experimentally relevant systems .",
    "the extended nature of loops turns out to have profound consequences when one attempts to write down an effective continuum description of these models , say , following landau s dictum of expanding the free energy ( euclidean action ) in powers of the order parameter and its derivatives .",
    "namely , terms which are geometrical in origin and non - perturbative in nature , and hence can not be inferred from symmetry arguments alone , appear in the action . on the other hand , exactly _ because _ these geometrical terms are present the values of the _ effective _ coupling constants of the field theory are completely determined , a rather remarkable occurrence .    usually in an effective description provided by a field theory ,",
    "coupling constants are phenomenological parameters fixed by auxiliary information about observable quantities , such as the response functions or the related correlation functions .",
    "the coulomb gas approach to two - dimensional critical phenomena is an example of an effective theory wherein the electromagnetic coupling constant ( i.  e. , the `` magnitude of the unit charge '' ) is determined from an exact solution of the model ; typically it suffices to calculate the exact value of a single critical exponent .",
    "our construction of an effective field theory of loop models closely parallels the coulomb gas method with the important difference that the coupling constants are determined without recourse to any exact information about the model . for the model at hand",
    "no such information is available anyway , and moreover there are indications that the model is not exactly solvable @xcite . on one level our theory can be viewed as a trick that allows one to calculate critical exponents in two - dimensional loop models without doing the `` hard work '' of exactly solving the model . on a deeper level",
    "it shows that lattice models of loops lead to continuum theories that are _ geometrical _ in nature , i.e. , devoid of any couplings that depend on the microscopic details .",
    "here we study in detail the two - flavour fully packed loop ( fpl@xmath4 ) model on the square lattice .",
    "this is a statistical model which describes two flavours of loops that occupy the bonds of the square lattice , subject to certain close packing constraints to which we shall return shortly .",
    "the phase diagram of this model is described by two variables , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are the loop fugacities of the two flavours ; see .",
    "the phase diagram of the fpl@xmath4 model has three important features that we wish to emphasize from the outset :    _ i _ ) for loop fugacities that fall into the region @xmath12 of the phase diagram the model is critical , i.e. , it exhibits a power - law distribution of loop sizes .",
    "the novel feature is that every point in the critical region defines a _ different _ universality class characterised by an infinite set of geometrical critical exponents .",
    "all previously studied loop models ( e.g. , @xmath8-state potts , o(@xmath5 ) models ) exhibit a _",
    "line _ of fixed points .",
    "_ ii _ ) the effective field theory of the 2 model in the critical region describes a fluctuating two - dimensional interface in five dimensions , which is characterised by _",
    "three _ elastic constants .",
    "we calculate these three couplings exactly as a function of the two loop fugacities .",
    "it is important to note that all previously solved loop models are characterised by a single elastic constant .",
    "_ iii _ ) from the field theory of the fpl@xmath4 model we calculate for the first time _ exact _",
    "results for the conformational exponents of compact polymers on the square lattice .",
    "furthermore , a particular line of fixed points in the phase diagram of the 2 model can be identified with _ interacting _ compact polymers ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we find that along this line the exponent @xmath1 changes continuously , whilst @xmath7 stays constant .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_com ] we review the scaling theory of compact polymers which provides our main motivation for introducing the two - flavour fully packed loop model on the square lattice in sec .",
    "[ sec_fpl ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the study of this model using field theoretical techniques and numerical transfer matrix calculations .",
    "the fpl@xmath4 model is mapped to an interface model in sec .",
    "[ sec_height ] . for the interface model",
    "we construct the scaling limit in terms of a liouville field theory , in sec .",
    "[ sec_lft ] . in secs .",
    "[ sec_cc ] and  [ sec_exp ] we make use of the field theory to calculate the central charge and the infinite set of geometrical exponents associated with loops , in the critical region of the loop model .",
    "a short description of the non - critical region based on the field theory is given next in sec .",

    "[ sec_tm ] and  [ sec_num ] we describe the construction of transfer matrices for different boundary conditions .",
    "they are used to determine the central charge , the first few geometrical exponents , and the residual entropy ; the numerical results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec_dis ] , we present some general observations regarding compact polymers and the coulomb gas description of conformal field theories",
    ". we also comment on the dimer - loop model @xcite and the three - state potts antiferromagnet @xcite , in light of our solution of the fully packed loop model on the square lattice .",
    "the appendices are reserved for the calculation of scaling dimensions of operators in the liouville field theory and the enumeration of connectivities which are used for constructing the transfer matrices .",
    "compact polymers , or hamiltonian walks , are self - avoiding random walks that visit _ all _ the sites of the underlying lattice ; see .",
    "they have been used as simple models of polymer melts @xcite and appear in statistical studies of protein folding @xcite .",
    "unlike dilute and dense polymers whose scaling properties were calculated exactly from the o(@xmath5 ) loop model @xcite , compact polymers defied a similar treatment until recently .",
    "numerical transfer matrix calculations @xcite , a bethe - ansatz solution @xcite , and a coulomb gas theory @xcite of the fully packed loop model on the _ honeycomb _ lattice , all conclude that compact polymers define a new universality class of critical behaviour . here",
    "we study compact polymers on the _ square _ lattice .",
    "we calculate exact scaling exponents and find them to be distinct from the honeycomb case .",
    "this was first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of numerical transfer matrix results .",
    "the lattice dependence of critical properties distinguishes the compact polymer problem from its dilute and dense counterparts in a crucial way .",
    "it places them into the class of geometrically frustrated critical systems .",
    "a physically relevant measure of frustration for compact polymers is the number of _ contacts _ per monomer .",
    "contacts are realised by monomer pairs where the two monomers are nearest neighbors on the lattice but are not adjacent along the polymer chain . in lattice models of proteins hydrophobic interactions among the amino acids",
    "occur at contacts @xcite . for the square model studied here the number of contacts per monomer is _ two _ , whilst on the honeycomb lattice it is _",
    "one_.    in order to study the scaling properties of compact polymers we focus our attention on the two most widely studied conformational exponents @xmath7 and @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath14 is the radius of gyration of the polymer then r ~n^ , where @xmath6 is the number of monomers .",
    "since compact polymers visit all the sites of a lattice , they are space - filling and we conclude that @xmath15 .",
    "this simple result will serve as an important check on our field theoretical calculations where it will be recovered .    in order to define the conformational exponent @xmath1 we introduce @xmath16 , the number of compact polymers ( hamiltonian walks ) on a square lattice with @xmath6 sites . since a compact polymer fills the lattice , boundary conditions ( free , periodic , etc . )",
    "play an important rle .",
    "following saleur and duplantier @xcite , we define @xmath1 in a way that is insensitive to the boundaries .",
    "namely , if we introduce the quantity @xmath17 , the number of compact - polymer _ rings _ , then we can expect ~n^ , where @xmath1 does not depend on the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate @xmath1 we need to solve the hard combinatorial problem of counting the number of open and closed compact polymers on the square lattice . following de gennes",
    "we do this by mapping the counting problem to the calculation of a correlation function in a particular statistical model at the critical point .",
    "consider the quantity @xmath18 , the number of compact polymer conformations that start at the vertex @xmath19 of the @xmath20 square lattice , and end at @xmath21 ( see ) ; we consider the limit @xmath22 , where @xmath19 and @xmath21 are chosen far from the boundaries of the lattice .",
    "for this quantity we can write down the scaling form@xcite : z(*x*,*y * ; n ) = c_(n ) |*x*-*y*|^-2x_1 f ( )  , where @xmath23 is a scaling function with the property @xmath24 as @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a geometrical exponent related to @xmath1 . integrating @xmath18 over all end - points @xmath21 and comparing the result to , the scaling relation = 1 - x_1 follows .    to calculate the geometrical exponent @xmath26 we introduce the two - flavour fully packed loop model on the square lattice",
    "the fact that we need _ two _ loop flavours follows from the simple observation that the bonds not covered by the compact polymer also form loops whose number is _",
    "unconstrained_. for the loop model we then construct an effective field theory in which @xmath18 becomes a two - point correlation function .",
    "the asymptotics of this function can be calculated exactly and we find @xmath27 , from which = 117/112 = 1.0446follows .",
    "this is to be compared to the mean - field theory value @xmath28 @xcite , which is also the result obtained for compact polymers on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the conformational exponent @xmath1 was measured directly from enumerations of conformations of chains with lengths up to 30 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the value @xmath29 was reported .",
    "more recently , from a numerical transfer matrix study of the fully packed loop model on the square lattice the geometrical exponent @xmath30 was determined @xcite , in excellent agreement with the exact result .",
    "another quantity of interest is the connective constant @xmath31 which determines the leading , exponential with system size scaling of the number of compact polymers @xcite c(n ) ~^n _ s^n^(d-1)/d n^-1  . here",
    "@xmath32 is the surface connective constant ; it appears due to the space - filling nature of compact polymers .",
    "both the value @xmath33 found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the estimate @xmath34 obtained from transfer matrix calculations similar to ours @xcite , seem in favour of the mean - field result @xmath35 @xcite . and @xmath36 . ] in sec .",
    "[ sec : entropy ] we report the very accurate numerical value @xmath37 which shows that the connective constant for compact polymers also deviates slightly from the mean - field result .    for the remainder of the paper we elaborate on the calculation of @xmath1 for compact polymers , in the process unveiling an extremely rich phase diagram of the associated loop model .",
    "as remarked earlier , it contains a two - dimensional region of fixed points , which we characterise in detail by calculating the central charge and the geometrical exponents associated with loops for each point on the critical manifold .",
    "the two - flavour fully packed loop model on the square lattice was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite as the loop representation of the four - colouring model  @xcite .",
    "it is the natural generalisation of the fully packed loop model on the honeycomb lattice , which is the loop representation of the three - colouring model@xcite . in general , a @xmath38-colouring model on a @xmath38-fold coordinated lattice is given by edge colourings of the lattice with @xmath38 different colours ; an edge colouring of a graph is one where no two bonds that share a common vertex are coloured equally .",
    "the colouring model is mapped to a loop model by choosing @xmath39 $ ] colour - pairs ; each pair defines strings of alternating colour that necessarily form loops ( unless they terminate at the boundary ) . in this way we end up with a loop model with",
    "@xmath39 $ ] flavours of loops .    to define the fpl@xmath4 model",
    "we first specify the allowed loop configurations @xmath40 . in @xmath40",
    "every bond of the square lattice belongs to one and only one loop of either flavour , and loops of the same flavour are not allowed to cross . representing the two flavours by solid ( black ) and hatched ( grey ) line segments respectively this fully packing constraint allows each vertex of the square lattice to have one of the six appearances depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertices ] .",
    "each loop is assigned a fugacity depending on its flavour : @xmath10 for black loops and @xmath11 for grey loops .",
    "the partition function of the fpl@xmath4 model is then z = _",
    "g n_b^n_b n_g^n_g  . the fully packed loop model of batchelor _",
    "et al._@xcite is obtained by setting the loop fugacity of the grey loops to unity . in the limit @xmath41",
    "we recover the compact polymer problem .",
    "if we define a restricted partition function of the 2 model , to which only configurations with a single black loop segment propagating between points @xmath19 and @xmath21 contribute , then @xmath42 in is obtained in the limit @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the first limit discards all configurations with black loops present , leaving only the black hamiltonian walk ( compact polymer ) between @xmath19 and @xmath21 , whilst the second ensures that all walks are weighted equally .",
    "we could also consider weighting different hamiltonian walks differently by setting @xmath45 .",
    "this situation can be interpreted as describing interacting compact polymers , and , as will be shown later , it leads to a continuously varying exponent @xmath1 .",
    "a similar property of interacting oriented polymers in the swollen phase was suggested by cardy from a field theoretical calculation @xcite .",
    "recent numerical studies of the interacting oriented self - avoiding walk by trovato and seno @xcite , though , seem to be at odds with cardy s prediction of an exponent @xmath1 that varies continuously with the interaction strength .",
    "some idea of the phase diagram of the fpl@xmath4 model as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be gotten by examining the extreme limits of the loop fugacities .",
    "namely , for @xmath46 all loops have the minimum length of four , i.e. , they each surround a single plaquette of the square lattice .",
    "there are no large loops in the system and the model is non - critical , or in other words , the average loop length is finite . on the other hand ,",
    "in the critical phase of the loop model , which is the subject of this paper , in a typical configuration one finds loops of all sizes characterised by a power - law distribution .",
    "this leads to an average loop length which diverges with the system size .",
    "such is the case in the other extreme limit of loop fugacities , @xmath47 , when the loops cover the whole lattice .",
    "other previously studied models that are particular points in the phase diagram of the fpl@xmath4 model are the four - colouring model , the dimer loop model , and the equal weighted six - vertex model ; see . for @xmath48 the loop fugacity of each loop can be evenly ( 1 + 1 ) distributed among the two ways of colouring the bonds occupied by the loop with two colours in an alteranting fashion : @xmath49 for black loops and @xmath50 for grey loops .",
    "this is then the symmetric four - colouring model ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the colours ) studied by baxter @xcite . in the dimer loop model black and white dimers",
    "are placed on the square lattice so that every vertex is covered by one of each @xcite .",
    "if we identify the dimer covered bonds with the black loops then this model is mapped to the @xmath53 fpl@xmath4 model . and",
    "finally @xmath54 constitutes the equal - weighted six - vertex model @xcite , the allowed vertices being those of fig .",
    "[ fig : vertices ] .",
    "the critical phase of the fpl@xmath4 model can be described in terms of an effective field theory , following the general procedure discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the idea is to think of loops as contours of a scalar field , which we refer to as the height .",
    "depending on the loop model in question the height can have one or more components .",
    "if the number of components is @xmath55 then the effective field theory of the loop model describes a fluctuating two - dimensional interface in @xmath56 dimensions .    to introduce the heights we first map the loop model to an _ oriented _ loop model , as shown in .",
    "the orientation of every loop is chosen randomly and independently .",
    "every non - oriented loop configuration is thus transformed into an oriented one ( @xmath57 ) ; the number of oriented configurations that correspond to the same non - oriented loop configuration is simply @xmath58 .",
    "next , for each loop we redistribute its weight ( fugacity ) , @xmath10 or @xmath11 depending on whether it is black or grey , between the two possible orientations . for the black loops we do this by assigning to , say , the clockwise orientation the _ phase factor _ @xmath59 , and the opposite phase , @xmath60 , to a counter - clockwise oriented black loop .",
    "similarly for grey loops the clockwise oriented ones are assigned a weight @xmath61 whilst the counter - clockwise loops are weighted with @xmath62 .",
    "the loop fugacities are related to the newly introduced parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 by n_b & = & 2 ( e_b ) + n_g & = & 2 ( e_g ) since the partition function of the original ( non - oriented ) model , as given by , must be recovered by independently summing over the two possible orientations for each loop .",
    "note that for @xmath65 the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 are real , whilst for @xmath66 they are purely imaginary . as discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec_term ] this is the crucial property that leads to a critical state of the loop model in the former and a non - critical one in the latter case .",
    "now that the loops are oriented we can interpret them as contours of a height field ; the orientation is necessary as it determines the direction of increasing height .",
    "the systematic construction of the _ microscopic heights _ sets out from the observation that every bond of the square lattice is in one of four possible states : it can be coloured black or grey , and oriented from an even to an odd site , or from odd to even . `` even '' and",
    "`` odd '' refer here to the two sublattices of the bipartite square lattice ; every even site is surrounded by four nearest neighbouring odd sites , and _",
    "vice versa_.",
    "the four possible bond - states are represented by four vectors  which are the colours in the four - colouring representation  @xmath67 and @xmath52 ; see c. the microscopic heights @xmath68 are defined on the dual lattice and the change in height when going from one plaquette centre to the next is given by @xmath69 or @xmath52 , depending on the state of the bond which is crossed ; d. for the height to be uniquely defined the four vectors must satisfy the constraint @xmath70 .",
    "this means that the microscopic heights live in a _ three - dimensional _ vector space , which we take to be @xmath71 . in other words",
    "the oriented 2 model maps to a model of a two - dimensional interface in five spatial dimensions .    by reasons of symmetry",
    "the four vectors are chosen so as to point from the centre to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron . with a suitable choice of coordinates",
    "they are represented by three - vectors : & = & ( -1,+1,+1 ) + * b * & = & ( + 1,+1,-1 ) + * c * & = & ( -1,-1,-1 ) + * d * & = & ( + 1,-1,+1 )  .",
    "this is the same normalisation as the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "mapping the loop model to on oriented loop model also allows for a _ local _ redistribution of the loop weights .",
    "this is important since it leads to a local field theory for the heights .",
    "as we will find out shortly , though local , this field theory is somewhat unconventional due to the non - local , extended nature of the fundamental microscopic objects it purports to describe .    to redistribute the phase factors associated with oriented loops we assign a phase @xmath72 to a vertex of the square lattice if a black loop makes a left turn at that vertex , the opposite phase @xmath73 if it makes a right turn , and the weight @xmath74 if it continues straight .",
    "the total vertex weight @xmath75 is a product of the phase factor originating from the black loop and an equivalent one from the grey loop passing through the same vertex @xmath19 .",
    "the partition function of the fpl@xmath4 model , , can now be rewritten as a sum over oriented loop configurations ( i.e. , colouring configurations ) z = _",
    "g _ * x * ( * x * )  .",
    "once the height at a single point is fixed @xmath57 is in a one - to - one correspondence with the configurations of the microscopic heights , and the summand in the above equation is the appropriate weight . in the critical phase of the fpl@xmath4 model the interface described by is _ rough _ , and the field theory",
    "is constructed so as to correctly reproduce its long - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the mapping from oriented loop configurations , which are equivalent to edge colourings , to microscopic height configurations is one to many .",
    "in particular , two height configurations corresponding to the same edge colouring can have their heights shifted with respect to each other by a _",
    "shift @xmath76 .",
    "the set @xmath77 forms a three - dimensional bravais lattice , i.e. , it is closed under integral linear combinations , and its elements are the _",
    "magnetic _ charges in the coulomb gas representation of the fpl@xmath4 model .",
    "the lattice reciprocal to the lattice of magnetic charges , @xmath78 , defines the _ electric _ charges @xmath79 , with the property @xmath80 .",
    "the construction of the lattice @xmath77 for the fpl@xmath4 model follows the usual prescription for height models , and has been carried out in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the sake of completeness we outline this construction below .",
    "it is convenient to first identify the _",
    "flat _ states ( also referred to as the _ ideal _ states ) , i.e. , those colouring states which minimise the variance of the microscopic height @xmath81 . from the height mapping described above it follows that these states have all of their plaquettes coloured with two colours only",
    "; an example is shown in c. this leads to a colouring state that is periodic , with the same @xmath82 colouring pattern repeated throughout the lattice .",
    "there are twenty four flat / ideal states for the colouring representation of the fpl@xmath4 model , corresponding to the number of permutations of four different colours .",
    "namely , an ideal state is completely specified by listing the colours of the bonds around a single site ( say the origin ) , starting from the left horizontal bond and proceeding clockwise . to each flat state",
    "we assign a _ coarse grained height _",
    "@xmath83 , which is the average microscopic height over a @xmath82 unit cell of the colouring .",
    "the flat states form a three dimensional graph , which we refer to as the ideal state graph , @xmath84 .",
    "namely , starting from any ideal state four other ideal states can be reached by exchanging a pair of colours that form a plaquette .",
    "for example , by exchanging the colours @xmath85 and @xmath86 in c all the @xmath87 plaquettes are turned into @xmath88 plaquettes to give a new ideal state . under these",
    "plaquette flips only the microscopic heights at the centres of the affected plaquettes are changed . in this way the ideal states form a four - fold coordinated graph in height space , where each vertex is indexed by a colour permutation , and its position in @xmath89",
    "is given by the coarse grained height @xmath90 .",
    "bonds are associated with transpositions of two colours ; they lie along the direction defined by the difference of the two colour vectors , and have a length of @xmath91 if the normalisation in is chosen .",
    "the ideal state graph is a tiling of @xmath89 with truncated octahedra ; this regular polyhedron is better known as the wigner - seitz cell of a body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice ( see ) .",
    "a single truncated octahedron in @xmath84 has twenty four vertices corresponding to the twenty four different ideal states .",
    "the set of vertices in @xmath84 representing the same ideal state form the _ repeat lattice _",
    "@xmath77 , which is face - centred cubic ( fcc ) with a conventional cubic cell of side 4 .    to obtain the continuum description of the fpl@xmath4 model we coarse grain the microscopic height over domains of ideal states .",
    "this gives rise to the coarse grained height @xmath90 which we can consider to be _ compactified _ on @xmath92 .",
    "the phase space of the height is not simply connected , thus allowing for topological defects ( vortices ) with topological charges that take their values in @xmath77@xcite .",
    "these defects are associated with _",
    "magnetic _ charges in the coulomb gas representation of the fpl@xmath4 model . _ electric _ charges on the other hand are associated with vertex operators @xmath93 .",
    "if we take the height to live in @xmath92 then vertex operators are well defined only for values of the electric charge @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath78 is the lattice _",
    "reciprocal _ to the lattice of magnetic charges @xmath77 , and it is a body - centred cubic ( bcc ) lattice with a conventional cubic cell of side @xmath94 .",
    "an effective field theory of the fpl@xmath4 model should describe large scale properties of loops . the kind of questions we expect it to answer are ones that do not refer to the microscopic details of the lattice model .",
    "for example , from the effective field theory we will calculate the asymptotics of the probability that two points lie on the same loop , when the separation between the points is large compared to the lattice spacing . from this and",
    "related quantities the conformational exponents of compact polymers can be extracted .",
    "the field theory of the 2 model is defined by the euclidean action for the coarse grained height @xmath90 .",
    "consider a typical configuration of the oriented fpl@xmath4 model which is equivalent to the colouring model .",
    "it consists of domains of ideal states . to each ideal state domain",

    "this theory has to break down at large values of the loop fugacity since in this case a typical state of the model will consist of small loops only , i.e. , a power - law distribution of loop sizes will be absent . that this indeed happens can be seen from the liouville field theory itself as it carries the seeds of its own demise .",
    "the mapping of the loop model to an oriented loop model for @xmath247 works equally well for @xmath248 or @xmath249 . from it follows that in the latter case at least one of the parameters , @xmath63 or @xmath64 , will be pure imaginary .",
    "this affects the liouville potential which for @xmath248 or @xmath249 becomes a _ relevant _ perturbation to the ( modified ) gaussian action @xmath250 .    to understand how this comes",
    "about we consider the simple case provided by the @xmath251 fpl@xmath4 model , discussed in sec .",
    "[ loop_ansatz ] .",
    "namely , as we increase the value of the loop fugacity we expect small loops to be favoured and the stiffness @xmath147 of the interface to grow . in the critical phase",
    "this is offset by the decrease in the background charge in a way that leaves the liouville potential marginal .",
    "now when the loop fugacity exceeds 2 the background charge @xmath252 becomes pure imaginary and the dimension of the liouville potential x_l =   can no longer stay marginal ; here @xmath253 , where the charges @xmath159 are given in , and their scaling dimensions are calculated from .",
    "in fact , assuming that the stiffness @xmath147 continues to increase with the loop fugacity for @xmath254 , @xmath255 turns complex with a real part that is _ smaller _ than two , rendering the liouville potential _ relevant_.    if we make the usual assumption of no intervening fixed points , the relevant liouville potential will generate a finite correlation length and the loop model will no longer be critical .",
    "the correlation length has the physical interpretation of the average size of a loop in the system .",
    "this scenario has been confirmed for the fully packed loop model on the honeycomb lattice , from the bethe ansatz solution of this model  @xcite .    a different view of the non - critical region of the 2 model is provided by the locking potential @xmath256 .",
    "namely , the discrete nature of the microscopic heights can be taken into account in the field theory by a negative potential in height space that is peaked around the flat , ideal states .",
    "as such , this potential is uniform on the ideal state graph and can therefore be expanded in a fourier series .",
    "examination of the most relevant vertex operators in this series @xcite reveals that they are the same as the ones for the loop - weight ( liouville ) potential , @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , just like @xmath127 , the locking potential in the non - critical region of the phase diagram is a _ relevant _ perturbation .",
    "thus , it will lock the interface in one of the ideal , flat states . in this flat phase",
    "the height fluctuations are bounded ( as opposed to being logarithmically divergent ) which is just another way of saying that large contour loops are exponentially suppressed . on the other hand , in the critical region of the 2 model",
    "the locking potential is marginal as it would be for an interface model _ at _ the roughening transition @xcite .",
    "this might indicate that the whole critical region of the 2 model can be understood as a manifold of essential singularities in some more general model , as was the case for the honeycomb fpl model @xcite .    as advertised in secs .",
    "[ sec_cc ] and  [ sec_exp ] our results for the central charge and a number of the geometrical scaling dimensions have been very accurately confirmed by transfer matrix calculations . before turning to a discussion of our numerical results",
    "we describe the particular representation of the transfer matrix used to obtain them .",
    "to construct the transfer matrix for the fpl@xmath4 model on a cylinder of circumference @xmath170 we write the partition function as @xmath257 where the length of the cylinder @xmath258 has been explicitly indicated .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the horizontal direction , whereas the bottom and the top row of the cylinder have open boundary conditions and hence terminate in @xmath170 dangling edges .",
    "we recall that the restriction of the summation to the set of fully packed graph configurations @xmath259 implies that locally the vertices are constrained to have one of the six appearances shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "the horizontal numbering pertains to the vertices , whilst in the vertical direction it is more convenient to label each row by the number of the vertex immediately below it .",

    "we shall soon see that the inclusion in @xmath259 of one or more strings running between the dangling edges of row 0 and @xmath258 helps us access the geometrical exponents of the model .",
    "in particular , the configuration of fig .",

    "the key to solving this problem is to write the tms in a basis of _ connectivity states _ comprising information about how the dangling ends of row @xmath258 are pairwise interconnected in the preceding rows and , if strings are present , information about the positions of such strings .",
    "in addition the connectivity states must keep track of the particular flavour of any loop or string segment terminating in row @xmath258 .",

    "this property leads to a dramatical reduction of the time and storage requirements for the calculations .    as was the case in the o(@xmath5 ) model @xcite ,",
