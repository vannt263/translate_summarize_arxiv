    "the period of an element @xmath2 is the element of @xmath3 that is defined by @xmath4 the periods of an abelian differential do not allow to recover the abelian differential itself , even infinitesimally . actually , it is always possible to find non trivial isoperiodic deformations of a given abelian differential , namely an immersed complex submanifold @xmath5 such that the period of a form @xmath6 is a locally constant function , when we use the local identifications of the @xmath7 s given by the gauss - manin connection .",
    "the case @xmath8 is instructive : every genus two curve is a double cover of @xmath9 ramified over six distinct points , say @xmath10 .",
    "an abelian differential on such a curve can be written as the hyperelliptic integrand @xmath11 picard - fuchs theory tells us that isoperiodic deformations on @xmath12 are integral curves of the following vector field    @xmath13    apart from the invariant closed subsets characterized by topological properties of the image of the periods , there is an interesting family @xmath14 of proper closed real analytic invariant submanifolds of the set of abelian differentials of fixed positive volume in @xmath15 .",
    "they were introduced by calta in @xcite and mcmullen in @xcite . the image of each @xmath16 under the torelli map corresponds to the set of principally polarized abelian surfaces with real multiplication by the real quadratic order @xmath17 of discriminant @xmath18 ; the abelian differential is an eigenform for the action of the order .",
    "such a set is diffeomorphic to a circle bundle over the hilbert modular surface @xmath19 ; we will call them hilbert modular invariant submanifolds .    in any genus",
    ", the collection of all maximal isoperiodic deformations defines a holomorphic foliation @xmath20 of @xmath1 , called the isoperiodic foliation ( see @xcite for further examples ) .",
    "it has dimension @xmath21 , and it is also algebraic : its leaves are solutions of a system of algebraic equations analogous to with respect to the deligne - mumford algebraic structure on moduli space .",
    "our main result is the following    [ dynamics of isoperiodic foliations ] [ t : dynamics ] let @xmath22 and @xmath2 , @xmath23 its volume , and @xmath24 the closure of the image of its periods .",
    "then the closure of the leaf @xmath25 passing through @xmath26 is , up to the action of @xmath27    * ( @xmath24 is discrete ) a connected component of the hurwitz space of ramified coverings of the elliptic differential @xmath28 of volume @xmath29 , * ( @xmath24 is @xmath30 ) the set of abelian differentials with periods contained in @xmath24 , with primitive imaginary part , and with volume @xmath29 , * ( @xmath31 ) the subset of @xmath1 consisting of abelian differentials of volume @xmath29 ,    if @xmath8 the same statement holds , with an extra possibility occurring when @xmath32 is an eigenform for real multiplication by a real quadratic order @xmath17 of discriminant @xmath33 . in this case",
    "the closure is the hilbert modular invariant submanifold @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , the restriction of @xmath20 to any of these analytic subsets of @xmath1 is ergodic with respect to the lebesgue class .",
    "the ergodicity part of this result was obtained independently by hamenst \" adt in @xcite .",
    "an example of application of theorem [ t : dynamics ] is the existence of an infinite number of abelian differentials with fixed non - discrete periods and only one zero . in the case of the periods of a form associated to a regular polygon these",
    "are called fake polygons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this statement was our original motivation .",
    "we thank p. hubert and e. lanneau for having discussed this problem with us .    theorem [ t :",
    "dynamics ] is proven by applying ratner s theory ( resp .",
    "moore ergodicity theorem ) to the linear action of the integer symplectic group @xmath34 on the subset of @xmath35 corresponding to periods of abelian differentials .",
    "this latter set has been characterized by haupt @xcite .",
    "it consists of periods @xmath36 such that @xmath37 with respect to the usual symplectic product on @xmath38 , that do not correspond to a collapse of @xmath39 handles ( see section [ s : stable forms and periods ] for more details ) .",
    "we denote it by @xmath40 . to apply these results in our setting",
    ", one needs to study topological properties of the period map @xmath41 defined at the level of the torelli covering @xmath42 .",
    "we prove    [ transfer principle ] [ t : connectedness ] the fibers of the period map are connected .",
    "this statement allows to transfer dynamical properties of the action of @xmath34 on @xmath40 to properties satisfied by the isoperiodic foliation on moduli space .",
    "indeed , theorem [ t : connectedness ] is equivalent to the fact that @xmath34-invariant subsets of @xmath40 are in bijective correspondance with @xmath20-saturated subsets of @xmath43 under the map @xmath44 as a consequence of theorem  [ t : connectedness ] , we deduce theorem  [ t : dynamics ] by applying ratner s theory to the action of @xmath45 on @xmath40 .",
    "the analysis of ratner s results in this particular case was carried by m. kapovich ( see @xcite ) who had the original idea of using ratner s theory in this setting . after classifying the closed @xmath34-invariant subsets of @xmath40 he gave an alternative proof of haupt s theorem for genus @xmath46 .",
    "we review kapovich s argument in the appendix [ s : dynamics ] , and in particular prove theorem [ t : dynamics ] assuming the transfer principle following theorem [ t : connectedness ] .",
    "theorem [ t : connectedness ] answers a problem posed by mcmullen in @xcite for genus @xmath47 . for genus @xmath48 ,",
    "he gave a proof by showing that a fiber of the period map on @xmath49 is a slice of the schottky locus in the siegel space @xmath50 of symmetric @xmath51 matrices with positive definite imaginary part , by a linear copy of the siegel space @xmath52 inside @xmath53 ( modulo partially compactifying the fibers by adding nodal abelian differentials of compact type ) . in genus @xmath48 the schottky locus is the whole of siegel space and for higher genera it is a proper analytic set .",
    "since the slice is not contained in the divisors corresponding to curves with nodes , this proves theorem [ t : connectedness ] for genus @xmath8 or @xmath54 .",
    "however , schottky s problem - the description of the schottky locus- is still open for @xmath55 and the argument seems difficult to generalize for higher genera .",
    "even if we knew the solution of the schottky problem , determining the components of the intersection with the linear slices does not seem an easy task .",
    "our road to theorem [ t : connectedness ] is different .",
    "it is based on an induction argument on the genus ( assuming the genus two and three cases ) involving degeneration of abelian differentials , i.e. the boundary of @xmath56 in its deligne - mumford compactification .",
    "we partially compactify @xmath57 by adding marked stable forms with a simple node and periods @xmath58 .",
    "the added forms can be constructed by using stable forms of lower genus .",
    "the inductive hypothesis allows to show that the partial compactification is connected . on the other hand we will prove that the added boundary points do not disconnect the partial compactification",
    "this follows mainly from the fact that at each added point in the boundary of @xmath56 there is a unique irreducible _ separatrix _ of the isoperiodic foliation , that is , a germ of analytic invariant set containing only points of the boundary and points of one leaf .",
    "a more detailed account of the difficulties and results used along the proof can be found in subsection [ ss : outilne of the proof ] .",
    "the full proof takes up most of sections [ s : inductive step ] to [ s : proof of inductive hypothesis ] .    theorem [ t : connectedness ]",
    "is also valid for the restriction of @xmath59 to the generic stratum .",
    "a question that arises naturally is the description of the connected components of the intersection of the fibers of @xmath59 with the other strata .",
    "kontsevich and zorich gave a description of the connected components of strata of abelian differentials without any condition on the periods in @xcite .",
    "they found cases with up to three components , so it is plausible too that , when we impose further conditions on the abelian differentials , there are also several components . an example is given in genus @xmath8 : the intersection of the non - generic stratum of @xmath15 with a leaf of the isoperiodic foliation that does not correspond to discrete periods forms an infinite discrete set ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a first problem that arises is determining the image of the period map on each such component . already in the minimal strata",
    "there are further restrictions on the periods : if they are discrete , the degree of the associated covering is at least @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the genus of the underlying curve .",
    "therefore the periods associated to a collapse of any number of handles onto a connected sum of two copies of an elliptic curve do not occur as periods of such an abelian differential .",
    "we shall not pursue this subject further here .",
    "the connectedness of the fibers of the lift of @xmath59 to the universal cover of @xmath56 fails in general , so the transfer principle does not work at that level .",
    "for example , in genus @xmath62 there are fibers of @xmath59 that do not cross the boundary components formed by curves of compact type ( see example [ ex : non compact type ] ) .",
    "such a fiber is biholomorphic to a siegel space , which is simply connected .",
    "thus at the level of the fundamental groups the inclusion @xmath63 is trivial .",
    "therefore there are infinitely many components of the lift of this fiber to the universal cover of @xmath56 .",
    "in fact in genus @xmath8 , mess showed in @xcite that a set of free generators for @xmath64 can be constructed with the use of the torelli map : in siegel space @xmath65 they appear as loops around the components of divisors formed by curves of compact type _ with _ nodes .",
    "we will see that for every @xmath66 we can find an infinite number of such components that are not crossed by the image of the natural map @xmath67 . for @xmath8",
    "this allows to prove that at the level of the fundamental group the map is not surjective .",
    "we thus deduce that there are several connected components in the lift of @xmath57 to the universal cover of @xmath56 .",
    "we expect the same to be true for all genera @xmath46 .",
    "another application of theorem [ t : connectedness ] is a correspondence between certain classes of integer valued periods and certain classes of representations of fundamental groups of punctured torus to the group of permutations @xmath68 of @xmath69 letters .",
    "this correspondence comes from the analysis of the transfer principle at the level of the closed leaves of the isoperiodic foliation .",
    "namely , the hurwitz spaces , i.e. moduli spaces of holomorphic coverings of degree @xmath69 over an elliptic curve ramifying over @xmath70 points counted with multiplicity . we do not know whether this correspondence is already known , but it gives an alternative point of view on the irreducible components of hurwitz spaces .",
    "[ t : application ] for any integers @xmath0 and @xmath71 , there is a bijective correspondence between , on one side , the sets of integer periods @xmath72 such that @xmath73 modulo precomposition by @xmath45 and , on the other side , the set of representations @xmath74 of a @xmath70-punctured torus group @xmath75 sending peripherals to transpositions , modulo precomposition by the braid group of the torus on @xmath70 braids , and post - conjugation by @xmath68 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : stable forms and periods ] we introduce the partial compactification and give the outline the proof of theorem [ t : connectedness ] .",
    "the complete proof takes up sections [ s : inductive step ] to [ s : proof of inductive hypothesis ] ; in the appendix [ s : dynamics ] we review kapovich s results on the dynamical properties of the integer symplectic group on the set of haupt periods .",

    "a connected complex curve @xmath76 is said to be stable if its singularities are nodes , and the closure @xmath77 of each component of @xmath78 is a smooth curve whose group of automorphisms that fix the punctures is finite .",
    "the normalization of @xmath76 is the smooth curve @xmath79 .",
    "a stable curve @xmath76 is said of compact type if every node separates @xmath76 in two components .",
    "otherwise @xmath76 is said to be of non - compact type .",

    "@xmath82 denotes the space of stable forms on @xmath76 .",
    "a stable one form will be sometimes referred to as an abelian differential .",
    "if @xmath76 has genus @xmath61 then the dimension of @xmath82 is @xmath61 . by the residue theorem if @xmath76 is of compact type , then all residues of all branches at the nodes have to be zero , and thus the forms have no residues at the nodes .    of course a stable form is holomorphic and closed outside the nodes and can thus be integrated along paths in @xmath81 . for closed paths the value of the integral does only depend on the homology class in @xmath83 and it is called the period of the class . if the residues at nodes are all zero , we can also integrate along paths passing _ through _ the nodes , and the integral along a closed path depends only on its class in @xmath84 .",
    "we are interested in isoperiodic sets of stable forms , that is , sets for which the set of periods around closed curves do not vary , and that coincide with the periods of some abelian differential on a smooth curve .",
    "since for the latter @xmath85 , it is natural to restrict ourselves to the space of stable forms without residues at the nodes . thus , the restriction of such a form to any component of the normalization is also an abelian differential .",
    "if none of the restrictions is the zero form , we say that the abelian differential has no zero components .",
    "by riemann - roch s theorem applied to each component @xmath77 of the normalization of @xmath76 we have that for an abelian differential @xmath86 with no zero components the degree of its associated divisor @xmath87 is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the genus of @xmath77 .",
    "in particular , if the restriction of @xmath32 to a connected component has no zeroes the component is an elliptic curve .",

    ". we will sometimes call such a singularity a saddle , because of the structure of the geodesics of a given direction at the point . at a simple node",
    "the metric extends regularly to each branch of the node and a small neighbourhood of the node is isometric to two flat discs identified at a point .",
    "the volume of a stable form @xmath86 is defined as the volume of this singular metric @xmath100 in particular , @xmath101 and it is finite if and only if all the residues of @xmath32 at the nodes of @xmath76 are zero .      in order to compare periods of abelian differentials of the same genus but",

    "it remains to treat the second one , namely the case @xmath1300 . in this latter ,",
    "the theorem of raghunathan and wolf cited above tells us that @xmath1301 is a lattice in @xmath1302 .",
