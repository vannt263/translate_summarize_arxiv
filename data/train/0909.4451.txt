    "in this review we will be mostly concerned with the motion of small solid particles in turbulent @xmath0he .",
    "this new and rapidly developing area of research has been initiated by the recent success of implementation of the particle image velocimetry ( piv ) and the particle tracking techniques in superfluid helium , see donnelly _ _ et al.__@xcite , van sciver and co - workers@xcite , and publications of the group involving paoletti , bewley , lathrop , sreenivasan and their co - workers@xcite . ( the only difference between these two , otherwise identical , techniques is that the results of piv yield the local average particle velocities obtained by calculating cross - correlations of particle ensembles and , therefore , result in the fluid - like , smooth velocity field , while the particle tracking aims at investigation of individual particle trajectories . )",
    "these are perhaps the only two well developed techniques which can identify the flow patterns in turbulent superfluid helium .",
    "the piv has been a standard technique in classical fluid dynamics for several decades ( see , for example , the book by raffel _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite ) . in experimental studies of classical turbulence , one can be confident that the motion of sufficiently small particles will reveal the details of turbulent motion of the viscous fluid . in superfluids , the two - fluid nature of @xmath0he makes an interpretation of piv measurements much more difficult : a solid particle interacts with both the normal fluid and the superfluid ; moreover , the particle may interact strongly with quantized vortex lines in the superfluid component , and even become trapped on them .",
    "the mechanism of trapping of solid particles is essentially the same as that of trapping the charge carriers on quantized vortices in @xmath0he , primarily because e.g. the negative ion ( electron ) forms around itself an almost macroscopic bubble of radius @xmath1 from which helium atoms are excluded .",
    "the ion trapping technique was used for detection of quantized vortices since late 50s , and , although not being suitable for studying the normal fluid patterns in @xmath0he , can be considered as the technique closely related to the piv and the particle tracking methods .",
    "we will review the development of the ion trapping technique in section 7 of this article .",
    "the aims of experimental physicists working in the area of superfluid turbulence are to understand the vortex tangle ( quantum turbulence ) , to measure velocity fluctuations in both the normal fluid and the superfluid , and possibly to make comparisons between quantum turbulence and ordinary turbulence . until recently the major difficulty was lack of direct flow visualization technique near absolute zero .",
    "existing methods , such as measurements of temperature differences to detect extra dissipation , ion trapping , measurements of second sound attenuation by quantized vortices , etc . probed only the vortex line density @xmath2 ( total vortex length per unit volume ) averaged over an experimental cell and",
    "did not reveal turbulent velocity fluctuations ( although a remarkable resolution has been recently achieved in second sound measurements by roche _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite of the local tangle density ) .",
    "experimental breakthrough was made in 2002 when the piv technique was successfully introduced in @xmath0he ( see references in the first paragraph of this section ) .",
    "this technique , which has been standard in classical fluid dynamics for many years , is based on injecting many small particles into the liquid .",
    "two images are produced using short laser pulses of different frequencies ( corresponding e.g. to the green and red colors ) focused into a narrow sheet and separated in time by a few milliseconds .",
    "software then analyzes the images and identifies green and red dots corresponding to the same particle at the two different times . in this way the observed distance between the corresponding dots yields the component of the local velocity in the plane of the light sheet .    in classical fluids ,",
    "provided the particle size is sufficiently small ( in turbulence studies , `` small '' means smaller than the kolmogorov length ) , the dominating force acting on the particle is the viscous drag force , so that a researcher can be confident that small particles trace the fluid motion ( in particular , turbulent velocity fluctuations ) rather well .",
    "because the viscosity of liquid helium is very low the kolmogorov scale in the turbulent normal fluid can be very small , so that it is essential that the particles used in visualization experiments are as small as possible . in the cited experimental works the typical particle diameter was of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "what do tracer particles trace in superfluid helium ?",
    "one may expect that , although the viscosity of @xmath0he is low , the dominating force exerted on the particle by the fluid will still be the viscous drag , so that solid particles should trace the normal fluid .",
    "however , this is not always true : due to the two - fluid nature of superfluid helium , the particles interact not only with the normal fluid , but also with the superfluid component through inertial and added mass forces ; moreover , the particles interact strongly with quantized vortices in superfluid and may even be trapped on superfluid vortex lines . therefore ,",
    "if we want to interpret results of piv and particle tracking measurements correctly , we must answer first the question asked in the beginning of this paragraph .",
    "this article is divided in sections where theoretical and numerical models of increasing complexity are compared to each other and to experimental results .",
    "the first model , described in section 2 , is the one - way coupling model . in sections 2.1 and 2.2",
    "we derive the governing equations of motion of particle tracers in the presence of two imposed fluids , the viscous normal fluid and the inviscid superfluid , under the assumptions that the particles do not disturb the flow , are smaller than any flow scale of interest , and do not become trapped in vortices .",
    "the one - way coupling model allows us to discuss the problem of the stability of particles trajectories , which is relevant to the visualization a pure superflow .",
    "the one - way coupling model is powerful enough to derive the general principles which lead to particles being trapped on vortices . in section 2 we present the experimental evidence for this trapping ( section 2.3 ) , and show how the mutual friction affects the motion of particles near vortex cores ( section 2.4 ) .",
    "three case studies are discussed of particle trajectories near vortices : vortex ring , thermal counterflow tangles , and vortex tangles at low temperatures ( section 2.5 ) .",
    "section 3 introduces the more sophisticated ( and computationally more expensive ) two - way coupling model ; in this model the back reaction of the flow on the particle is taken into account , and the dynamics of the particle - vortex interaction and the trapping can be studied in great detail , including what happens at the surface of the particle ( which we assume to be spherical for simplicity ) .",
    "section 3.1 contains the mathematical formulation of the two - way coupling model ; sections 3.2 and 3.3 are devoted to the numerical calculations of typical vortex - particle interactions .",
    "section 4 makes use of the results of the numerical simulations described in section 3 to derive a simpler analytical model which explains in a quantitive way experiments performed in florida@xcite in which heavy particles fell through a tangle of vortices .",
    "the two - way coupling model is also applied to particles moving in tangles generated by a thermal counterflow : these numerical results are applied to particle - tracking experiments performed in maryland@xcite . by considering numerical calculations at small and high values of the vortex line density ,",
    "we solve the apparent disagreement between the florida and maryland experiments : the discussion will reveal that the two experiments refer to two different regimes , which are both explained by the two - way coupling model . in section 4",
    "we also discuss the experimental observation of flow structures observed behind and in front a cylindrical obstacle set in the middle of a counterflow channel , and propose a simple analytical two - dimensional model which accounts , at least in principle , for the qualitative existence of these flow structures .",
    "section 5 describes the most recent experimental discoveries obtained using tracer particles : the observation of turbulent boundary layer flows , the visualization of individual vortex reconnections , and the measurement of velocity statistics .",
    "section 7 reviews other techniques based on trapping ions and imaging @xmath4 molecules ; these techniques share important principles ( but not the size of the trapped object ) with piv and particle tracking techniques .",
    "section 8 contains the final discussion .",
    "we begin answering this question with a relatively simple , `` one - way coupling '' model which follows the approach standard in classical two - phase turbulence studies .",
    "we will generalize to the two - fluid model of superfluid helium the equations of motion of a solid spherical particle of radius @xmath5 in a nonuniform flow of classical fluid .",
    "we assume that 1 )  the presence of particles does not modify the turbulence , 2 )  the flow velocities vary little over a distance of the order of particle size , and 3 )  particles do not interact strongly with quantized vortex lines and are certainly not trapped on these lines .",
    "these assumptions require that the particle size be much smaller than both the kolmogorov lengthscale , @xmath6 in the normal fluid , and the mean intervortex distance , @xmath7 in the superfluid .",
    "below we formulate , under these assumptions , the equations of particle motion .",
    "we start with the fluid - particle interaction in classical liquids .",
    "we consider a spherical solid particle of radius @xmath5 in the nonuniform flow .",
    "let the ambient ( that is , in the absence of the particle ) fluid velocity field be @xmath8 . according to the assumptions formulated above",
    ", the size of the particle is much smaller than the flow lengthscale , @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 , so that we can introduce a small parameter @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the particle velocity .      as shown by auton _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , the total force acting on the particle in the nonuniform , inviscid flow can , under assumption  ( [ varepsilon ] ) , be represented in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the inertial and the added mass force , respectively , @xmath15 is the particle volume , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the added mass coefficient ( for spherical particle @xmath18 ) ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vorticity , represents the lift force arising due to stretching of vortex lines in the vicinity of the sphere s surface .",
    "we will consider the motion of a solid particle in the viscous fluid assuming that the particle reynolds number is small : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "note that small particle reynolds numbers are typical of piv and particle tracking experiments , both in classical fluids and in superfluid helium .",
    "we will consider the particle motion under the assumptions formulated above ( in particular that the parameter @xmath23 introduced by formula  ( [ varepsilon ] ) is small ) .",
    "detailed analysis of the forces acting on the particle in the nonuniform viscous flow can be found in works by maxey and riley@xcite , mei@xcite , and kim , elghobashi , and sirignano@xcite .",
    "the total force acting on the particle can be represented as a sum of several contributions , i.e. the gravity , viscous drag , the inertial and added mass force , faxn correction arising due to the local non - uniformity of the ambient flow , the saffman lift force arising due to the local shear , and the magnus lift force arising due to rotation of the particle .    the main contribution , dominating in most particulate flows , is the viscous stokes drag force : @xmath24    surprisingly , in the viscous flow the inertial and added mass forces , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are determined by the same formulae  ( [ inert_and_added])-([f ] ) as for the inviscid flow , with the same added mass coefficient , @xmath18 for the spherical particle .      to determine the force acting on the particle in @xmath0he , we simply add together all the forces exerted by the normal fluid and the superfluid . since the superflow is potential ,",
    "@xmath27 is identically zero , provided the particle does not become trapped on quantized vortex lines .",
    "as shown by poole _ _ et al.__@xcite , for the flow properties and physical parameters typical of the normal component of @xmath0he , the faxn correction , the history and lift forces can be neglected provided the particle reynolds number and the parameter @xmath28 are small and the particle size is significantly smaller than the kolmogorov length . therefore , the total force acting on the particle can be approximated as @xmath29 where the subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 refer to the normal fluid and the superfluid , respectively . here",
    "@xmath32 is the combination of gravity and buoyancy , and @xmath33 is the viscous drag force exerted by the normal fluid : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the viscosity of @xmath0he .",
    "substantial derivatives required for determining the inertial and added mass forces in the normal and superfluid components are now defined by formula  ( [ ddt ] ) with @xmath36 replaced by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we arrive at the following equation of particle motion@xcite : @xmath39 this equation must be considered together with the kinematic equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) should be regarded as a lagrangian trajectory of the solid particle .",
    "( [ motion1 ] ) and ( [ kinematic ] ) constitute the closed system for the unknown particle position and velocity , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .    often (",
    "although not always ) in the piv and particle tracking experiments neutrally buoyant particles ( with @xmath45 ) are used in order to eliminate unwanted effects of gravity on the particle motion .",
    "for neutrally buoyant particles , eq .",
    "( [ motion1 ] ) can be written in a more concise form @xmath46 where @xmath47 the parameter @xmath48 , which shows how quickly the particle adjusts its motion to the viscous flow , plays an important rle in the study of particle motion in fluids , and is commonly known as either the particle response time , or viscous relaxation time .",
    "analyzing eqs .",
    "( [ kinematic ] ) and ( [ motion2 ] ) , poole _ _ et al.__@xcite showed that , provided @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the timescale of the fluid motion ( e.g. the kolmogorov time ) , the neutrally buoyant particle tracks the motion of the normal fluid . if @xmath51 , the particle moves with a velocity corresponding to the total current density , @xmath52 .",
    "however , two important issues may invalidate these conclusions : 1 ) instability of particle trajectories , and 2 ) trapping of particles on superfluid vortex lines .",
    "the analysis of particle trapping will require more elaborate , self - consistent , two - way coupling model which would account for deformation of the vortex filament by the approaching particle , including possible reconnection of the vortex with the particle surface ( see below section  [ self - consistent ] ) .",
    "instability of lagrangian trajectories of the neutrally buoyant particle in the classical viscous fluid was discovered and studied relatively recently by babiano _ _ et al.__@xcite . to illustrate such an instability in turbulent superfluid at finite temperature such that both the normal fluid and the superfluid component are present",
    ", we consider the simplest case assuming that @xmath53 down to the length scales comparable to the vortex line spacing .",
    "the lagrangian equations of particle motion , which become @xmath54 have , provided @xmath55 and @xmath56 , a formal solution @xmath57 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is a trajectory of the fluid point . therefore , it would seem natural to conclude that neutrally buoyant particles follow the fluid exactly .",
    "however , let us consider now the particle motion in the so - called abc ( arnold - beltrami - childress ) flow , frequently used as the simplest model of turbulence , whose velocity field is @xmath60 the time sequence@xcite illustrating the position of large number of neutrally buoyant tracer particles in the abc flow , starting from their uniform distribution , is shown in fig .",
    "[ segregation ] .",
    "it can be seen that particles do not    follow the fluid , but instead , due to instabilities of their trajectories , travel from the regions of high vorticity to the regions of high rate of strain .",
    "( in classical multiphase fluid dynamics similar phenomenon for particles heavier than the fluid has been studied in detail .",
    "however , the mechanism of segregation of heavy particles is quite different from that of neutrally buoyant particles . )",
    "note , though , that this instability develops rather slowly : the last frame of fig .",
    "[ segregation ] , recovering the lines of minimum vorticity and maximum rate of strain , corresponds to 3 times of turnover of the abc flow .",
    "instability of particle trajectories is more pronounced in the case @xmath61 when the normal fluid is absent .",
    "the equations of motion of neutrally buoyant particle become @xmath62 and have a formal solution @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , so that , in the case of very low temperature when the normal fluid is absent , it can be expected that neutrally buoyant particles trace the superfluid . however , this is not the case either .",
    "consider the simplest case of the neutrally buoyant particle moving around a single , stationary , straight vortex line",
    ". in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath66 the equations of particle motion are : @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "if at the initial moment the particle velocity does not coincide exactly with the fluid velocity , the particle will spiral either outwards , or inwards .",
    "we arrive at the conclusion which remains valid in the general case of particle motion at temperature @xmath61 ( sergeev _ _ et al.__@xcite ) : unless the initial velocity of neutrally buoyant particle matches exactly the velocity of the fluid point , the trajectory of the solid particle deviates significantly from the trajectory of the fluid point .",
    "such an instability is amplified by any macroscopic mismatch between the velocity of the superfluid and the velocity of the particle at the beginning of the experiment .",
    "this is further illustrated by fig .",
    "[ three_vortices ] showing the trajectories of solid and    fluid particles around three vortices .",
    "why can the superfluid vortex trap the particle ? to answer this question , we have to take into account a possibility of reconnection of the quantized vortex to the surface of moving particle ( a more detailed analysis of the mechanism of this process will be given below in section  [ self - consistent ] ) .",
    "below three different versions , or , rather , three different ways of explaining the reason for particle trapping are suggested .",
    "imagine that the quantized vortex reconnects symmetrically to the surface of spherical particle , as shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ asymmetric ] .",
    "the kinetic energy of the flow field created by the straight quantized vortex can be easily calculated , and in the symmetric configuration is reduced by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the vortex core radius .",
    "note that assuming @xmath72 this result follows from the substitution energy calculated by parks and donnelly@xcite for the ion bubble trapped by the quantized vortex line , see below sec .",
    "[ related_techniques ] and formula  ( [ substitution ] ) therein .",
    "formula  ( [ reduced_e ] ) determines the kinetic energy which the particle would require to break free from the symmetric vortex configuration shown in fig .",

    "the flow field of the vortex creates a pressure gradient @xmath74 attracting the particle to the vortex .",
    "if the particle - vortex configuration is symmetric , as in the right part of fig .",
    "[ asymmetric ] , then ,    obviously , the force acting on the particle is zero .",
    "now imagine that this symmetry is perturbed as shown in the left part of this figure .",
    "the superfluid component is inviscid , so that the following arguments apply based on bernoulli s integral : the fluid velocity on the right side of the particle surface , where the two vortex strands are closer , is greater than that on the left side , and , therefore , the pressure is bigger on the left side of the sphere .",
    "this provides a net force restoring the symmetric particle - vortex configuration .      experimental evidence comes from the publication of bewley , lathrop and sreenivasan@xcite ( see also more recent papers@xcite ) .",
    "[ sreeni_nature ] , published in the cited paper@xcite , shows that the researchers , using the piv technique , actually `` painted '' quantized vortices by tracer particles .",
    "another evidence comes not from experiments , but from the quantum calculation based on the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "berloff and roberts@xcite studied an interaction between the negative ion and the quantized vortex . in superfluid helium , the negative ion forms around itself a bubble of diameter",

    ", the question can be asked whether it is worth or not further exploiting the one - way coupling model which neglects any influence of the particle on the vortex evolution .",
    "the answer is `` yes '' : there are cases where trapping events are not very frequent , so that a useful information about the behaviour of tracer particles can be obtained by ignoring their trapping on vortex cores .",
    "we will also show that the mutual friction between quantized vortices and the normal fluid can prevent trapping .    in the vicinity of the vortex core , the mutual friction induces , in the normal fluid , the vortex dipole whose typical lengthscale is expected to be about @xmath78 .",

    "normal fluid vortical structures induced by the mutual friction were predicted by hall and vinen@xcite and kivotides , barenghi , and samuels@xcite , but so far , because of low resolution of experimental techniques , there was no direct experimental proof of existence of the normal fluid disturbances . owing to the much higher resolution",
    ", the piv and particle tracking techniques can provide such an evidence .",

    "moreover , the calculation showed that trapping events are relatively rare  only 42 out of 900 particles approached the ring to a distance smaller than three particle diameters .",

    "the particle tracking technique was further developed by paoletti , fisher , sreenivasan , and lathrop  @xcite to investigate , by analyzing the trajectories of tracer particles , the velocity statistics in decaying quantum turbulence .",

    "the experiment has stimulated calculations @xcite of turbulent velocity statistics in the context of three - dimensional and two - dimensional atomic bose - einstein condensates ; after finding similar non - gaussian velocity statistics in these related quantum systems the authors argued that , in general , non - gaussian statistics arise from the singular nature of the velocity field around quantized vortices .",
    "the results of fundamental importance reported in these two reviewed publications  @xcite raise , however , the following question : what effect have the particles trapped on vortex filaments on the evolution of quantized vortices and , in particular , on the reconnection of two approaching vortices ? in their work@xcite reviewed earlier in sec .",
    "[ tracking ] the authors claimed that , because in their experiments the distance between micron - size particles trapped on the same vortex filament was typically about @xmath78 , the influence of trapped particles on the evolution of vortices can be neglected .",
    "this claim is yet to be justified ( especially where the motion and evolution of vortex filaments near the reconnection point is concerned ) .",
    "it is unlikely that at present this problem can be treated experimentally ; a more realistic alternative seems to be a development of the mathematical model of a vortex filament loaded by trapped solid particles@xcite .",
    "the technique of vortex detection by ion trapping was recently reviewed in a number of regular research publications including some in this journal@xcite , so that we will present here a rather brief overview of theoretical and experimental aspects of this technique .",
    "the idea of using charge carriers for detection of quantized vortices in superfluids is much older than that of using solid particles for the flow visualization in @xmath0he and dates back to the works of careri@xcite , and reif and meyer@xcite .",
    "the technique is based on the phenomenon that a negative charge ( a single electron ) injected into @xmath0he self - localizes itself in a spherical void ( known as the ion or electron bubble ) of radius @xmath1 ( depending on pressure ) from which helium atoms are excluded .",
    "( a relatively large size of this , almost macroscopic bubble justifies inclusion of this chapter into our review otherwise concerned with the motion of much larger , solid particles in @xmath0he . ) the model of the negative ion bubble was proposed by ferrel and later elaborated by kuper and other authors@xcite and confirmed experimentally by levine and sanders@xcite .",

    "the combined action of the bernoulli effect and the reduced condensation energy of the core produces a potential well of the depth of the order @xmath121@xcite and hence traps the ion .",

    "[ trapping ] of trapping of solid particles on the vortex cores .",

    "the radius of this snowball is from 7 to @xmath122 , depending on pressure . like the negative ion bubble ,",
    "such a snowball will be attracted , by the bernoulli force , to the vortex core so that , in principle , positive ions can also be used for detection of quantized vortices . however",
    ", a smaller than that of the ion bubble radius of the snowball and , therefore , the cross - section of the snowball - vortex interaction make the experimental technique using positive ions more difficult and less practical .",
    "hence in this review we will discuss only works concerned with negative charge carriers .",
    "the realization of the negative ion technique can be illustrated by the following arrangements of the experiment , typical of the early observations of single vortex lines in rotating @xmath0he : quantized vortex lines are charged first by ion bubbles trapped on them using e.g. the electron beam emitted orthogonally to the axis of rotation .",
    "the vortex lines are then detected by applying the electric field parallel to the axis of rotation so that trapped electron bubbles slide along vortex filaments to a collector attached to an electrometer .",
    "the latter registers the amount of collected charge which is proportional to the number of vortex lines present . in its early , simplest version this technique allowed to determine only the total number of ( almost ) straight quantized vortex lines in a slowly rotating container .",
    "its subsequent modifications made possible also detection of individual vortex lines and later the measurement of the vortex line density in turbulent @xmath0he .",
    "the theory of ion trapping by the quantized vortex has been developed in classical works of donnelly , roberts , and parks@xcite . to analyze ion - vortex interactions ,",
    "two competing mechanisms were taken into account : trapping of the ion bubble , moving in the electric field , in the potential well of the vortex , and escape of the trapped ion due to its brownian motion , which was considered to be in equilibrium with thermal ( quasiparticle ) excitations in @xmath0he .",
    "two parts of this problem were calculations of 1 )  the trapping ( or capture ) cross - section , @xmath123 , and 2 )  the escape probability , @xmath124 ; the second part was analyzed using smoluchowski or fokker - planck equations in the framework of the kramers - chandrasekhar method for calculation the probability of escape of a particle by diffusion from a potential well .",
    "the capture cross - section , which was found to be of the order @xmath125 to @xmath126 and to decrease with the electric field and increase with temperature to about @xmath127 , at which temperature it drops sharply .",
    "the escape probability ( or , equivalently , the mean trapping lifetime , @xmath128 ) was found in a good agreement with experimental data obtained by springett , tanner , and donnelly@xcite as well as with experimental results of douglass and cade@xcite .",
    "the effective cross - section can then be calculated as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is some characteristic time .",
    "parks and donnelly@xcite further developed the theory in order to make possible calculation of the ion bubble radius from the experimentally measured mean trapping lifetime .",
    "this required , in particular , a calculation of the so - called substitution energy , i.e. a kinetic energy of rotating superfluid excluded by the trapped bubble . for the ion bubble of radius @xmath131 trapped symmetrically on the vortex core this was found as @xmath132 \\label{substitution}\\ ] ] ( note that formula  ( [ reduced_e ] ) of sec .",

    "( [ substitution ] ) assuming @xmath133 ) . in the context of further experimental studies discussed below ,",
    "it is worth noticing that the substitution energy ( equal to the depth of the potential well ) is about @xmath121 .",
    "parks and donnelly s study of bubble radii was further developed by springett and donnelly@xcite who used the measurements of trapping cross - sections in the rotating container to deduce that the radius of the ion bubble decreases with pressure .",
    "the theory developed by donnelly _",
    "et al . _ also predicted that the mean trapping lifetime should increase with the superfluid density and with the radius of ion bubble .",
    "these predictions were soon confirmed experimentally by springett@xcite who measured , at various pressures and temperatures , the cross - section of the ion capture and ion mobilities in order to derive from these data the pressure and temperature dependence of the ion bubble radius and the mean trapping lifetime .",
    "later pratt and zimmermann@xcite also measured the mean trapping lifetime in the wide range of temperatures and pressures ( from vaporization and solidification ) and showed that at constant pressure the lifetime rapidly decreases with @xmath134 .",
    "in particular , it was found that at saturated vapor pressure trapping becomes negligible at temperature above @xmath135 , the value which is now often referred to as the `` abrupt lifetime edge '' . it was also shown that the temperature , below which trapping becomes significant increases with pressure . glaberson@xcite",
    "measured the mobility , as a function of temperature and pressure , of negative ions trapped on quantized vortex lines , and arrived at the important conclusion that the negative ion bubbles do not deform as they are trapped on vortex cores .",
    "he also developed a new model , which appeared to account satisfactory for available experimental results , for the drag exerted on the trapped ion bubble , based on the assumption that the vortex line has several thick central core surrounded by a tail of excess roton density with momenta opposite to the direction of circulation .    among the first applications of the ion trapping technique for an investigation of vortex structures in @xmath0he was an observation by northby and donnelly@xcite of a nonlinear dependence of the number of quantized vortex lines on the angular velocity of the rotating container .",
    "this nonlinearity was found to be associated with the existence of a near - wall region , observed in the cited work , free of quantized vortices .",
    "the early experiments@xcite have indicated that ions interact strongly with turbulence in @xmath0he , but no quantitative data have been obtained yet .",
    "the first experimental study of the turbulent vortex tangle by the ion trapping technique was undertaken by sitton and moss@xcite in 1969 ( in fact it was the first direct experimental confirmation that the turbulence in the superfluid component of @xmath0he is composed of individual , quantized vortex lines indistinguishable from those produced in the ( slowly ) rotating container except for their configurations ) .",
    "the vortex tangle was produced by the supercritical heat current at temperature above @xmath127 .",
    "since most of the vortex lines are no longer straight but have a configuration of loops and kinks , the charge can no longer slide along the filaments to a collector but is trapped inside the tangle .",
    "the fraction @xmath136 of the trapped charge was measured and then linked with the vortex line density by the relation @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the ion velocity , and @xmath2 can be linked with the heat flux and properties of @xmath0he by the well known vinen equation@xcite .",
    "a series of experimental studies and their interpretation , beginning 1972 and spanning the period of nearly 30 years , was undertaken by the group led by packard and williams . in 1972 ,",
    "packard and sanders@xcite showed the possibility of detecting individual vortex lines in rotating @xmath0he .",
    "the experiments were performed in a cylindrical container whose rotation slowly accelerated so that the number of vortex lines present increased with time .",
    "the experimental arrangements were similar to those described above,.i.e .",
    "the charge trapped on vortex lines was measured by applying the axial electric field thus transferring the charge to a collector attached to an electrometer .",
    "the appearance of each new vortex line was detected by a steplike increase in the electrometer s reading . bringing the container slowly to rest , the authors also discovered the existence of remanent vorticity studied later by awschalom and schwarz ( see below ) .",
    "later williams and packard@xcite developed the first photographic technique which directly visualized spatial positions of individual quantized vortex lines in rotating @xmath0he .",
    "the experimental arrangements were similar to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , but in addition the magnetic focusing was used to stabilize beams of electrons emitted from the charged vortex lines ; these beams impinged on a phosphor screen so that the positions of quantized vortices could be actually photographed .",
    "experiments were performed at temperatures lower than @xmath139 , and up to 0.8% of @xmath140he ( which acted as a fixed amount of normal fluid ) was added to stabilize the vortices . among other results ,",
    "it was found , in agreement with the classical feynman s prediction , that the average intervortex spacing is @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the angular speed of rotation , but in this work an expected stable triangular lattice of vortices was never observed .",
    "the photographs of regular , symmetric arrays of vortices were obtained when this experiment was repeated some years later@xcite .",
    "( these photographs should be very familiar to a reader through numerous reproductions in other publications and hence are not shown here . ) the authors ascribed to mechanical disturbances their earlier failure to observe the regular structures .",
    "they also argued that the symmetric state of the system is determined not by the absolute minimum of the free energy , as has been believed earlier , but by the combination of the past history of the system and the local minimum of the free energy , concluding that the symmetric state is highly metastable .",
    "the detailed description of the photographic technique for visualizing the positions of quantized vortices in rotating @xmath0he was given in work@xcite .",
    "much later one of the authors claimed@xcite that usual helium ions are not really suitable for detection of thermally excited vortices , and that multielectron bubbles should be employed for this purpose .",
    "also such an experiment was outlined in the cited paper , the authors of this review are not aware of any practical development in this direction .    using the experimental technique of ref .",
    "@xcite , this research group also revisited@xcite the problem , analyzed earlier theoretically by donnelly , roberts , and parks@xcite , of the lifetime of ions trapped on the vortex lines .",
    "theoretical analysis predicted that in the temperature interval @xmath143 the mean lifetime should be longer than @xmath144 and that it should increase with decreasing temperature .",
    "however , the experiments revealed that the observed lifetime was many orders of magnitude smaller and was actually decreasing as temperature decreased . to resolve the contradiction with the theoretical predictions , the authors suggested that at temperatures lower than @xmath145 the trapping lifetime is no longer determined by the intrinsic properties of bubble - vortex interaction but by a time scale of the vortex motion until it is destroyed by the container s wall .",
    "the details of this mechanism were suggested by the authors as follows : as the moving vortex filament encounters the wall , it is destroyed ( so that the charge is collected by the wall ) , but , to maintain the equilibrium value of the vortex line density , another , uncharged filament is created . in the case where the time scale of migration of the vortex filament to the wall is smaller than the intrinsic trapping lifetime of the ion bubble , the vortex motion will be a limiting factor of the charge loss .",
    "the authors concluded that at low temperatures such that the normal fluid density and hence viscous damping ( by the mutual friction ) become negligible , the observed lifetime is actually the measure of the timescale of the vortex migration to the wall and , therefore , should be independent of temperature , in agreement with the authors observations .",
    "furthermore , the authors argued that their conclusions can also be related to the earlier observations by cheng , cromar , and donnelly@xcite that the ion trapping reduces in the presence of the axial heat current .",
    "the explanation suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite is that in the counterflow turbulence the mutual friction increases the intensity of the vortex motion and hence the rate of destruction of vortices by the wall .",
    "employing the ion trapping technique , one of the works of key importance for understanding the mechanism of the onset of quantum turbulence is that of awschalom and schwarz@xcite .",
    "this experiment used two parallel plates , immersed in @xmath0he , one of which serves as a charge collector detecting the vortices pinned to both plates .",
    "( the experiment aimed , in particular , to support the earlier schwarz s idea@xcite , based on his analysys of vortex reconnections , that under some conditions vortex singularities can multiply . ) the experiment showed that quiescent @xmath0he contains a rather large number of quantized vortex filaments which are pinned metastably to the parallel plates .",
    "the line density of these remanent vortices seems to be history independent , and its existence was established upon going , in temperature , down through the @xmath9 transition .",
    "( note that in this work the vortex line density was not measured directly but estimated , considering the rather complicated geometry of electric field lines , from the measurement of the collected charge . )",
    "awschalom and schwarz found that the line density of remanent vortices is very close to the critical line density , introduced by tough@xcite , below which vortices disappear .",
    "the authors interpretation of the critical line density was that the vortex filament do not disappear but become immobilized by pinning to the walls and hence can not be observed by any conventional experimental technique .",
    "the authors also justified their ideas by analyzing the evolution of the vortex line density in decaying turbulence produced by ultrasound .",
    "they observed that , after the ultrasound has been switched off , @xmath2 decays not to zero but to the value of the remanent vortex line density .",
    "( earlier experiments of milliken schwarz , and smith@xcite produced qualitatively similar results . )",
    "the authors concluded that any volume `` will be penetrated _ ab initio _ by quantized vortices stabilized by surface pinning '' , and hence all experiments on the evolution of the vortex line density should be interpreted as if @xmath2 starts from the value corresponding to the remanent vortex line density .",
    "the first attempt of systematic experimental study , by means of the ion trapping technique , of the decay of quantum turbulence was made by davis , hendry , and mcclintock@xcite . in turbulence , generated by the oscillating grid ,",
    "some ions emitted from the tip get trapped on vortices within the tangle and hence reduce the current arriving at the collector .",
    "the evolution of the vortex line density can be estimated from the evolution of this current , and the experiment clearly demonstrated the production and decay of quantum turbulence as well as its spatial distribution . however , this experiment had certain disadvantages .",
    "in particular , the value of the vortex line density in the low temperature limit ( from 200 down to @xmath146 ) remained unknown , and the data on trapping cross - sections at these temperature had not yet been available .",
    "nevertheless , thies experiment yielded a very useful information on the time scale of decay , and also showed that in the temperature range from 22 to @xmath147 the process becomes temperature independent .",
    "clearly , a modification of the classical ion trapping experimental arrangements was required that would make possible , in the low temperature limit @xmath148 , to measure directly the dynamics of the vortex tangle as well as the trapping cross - sections .",
    "such a new technique was recently developed by walmsley , golov and their co - workers@xcite ; the detailed description of the experimental cell and methods can be found in the first two of the cited works .",
    "the experimental cell , mounted on a rotating cryostat , is a cube whose sides are electrodes serving as the charge collectors . in the earlier experiment@xcite",
    "just one ion emission tip was fitted at the bottom side of the cell , while later experiment@xcite used two emission tips fitted at the bottom and one of the side plates . in order to provide the means of measuring the spatial properties of the vortex tangle",
    ", a difference of electric potential was kept between some of the electrodes to ensure depletion of the ion current emitted by the tips .",
    "an analysis of ion trapping by quantized vortices suggests the exponential decay of the ion current , collected by the electrodes , with the vortex line density , so that the latter can be recovered from the measurements of the current @xmath149 from the relation @xmath150 $ ] , where @xmath151 is the size of the experimental cell .",
    "the turbulence was produced by spin up or / and spin down of the rotating experimental cell .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors argued in favor of using , as probe particles , the charged vortex rings rather than bare ions .",
    "the reason is that the trapping cross - section of the bare ion bubble is small , @xmath152@xcite , and was never measured at temperature below @xmath153 . on the other hand , at low temperatures , in the case where the vortex nucleation velocity , @xmath154 is lower than landau critical velocity , @xmath155 , the ion , upon reaching the velocity @xmath154 will nucleate the vortex ring that captures the ion thus forming the stable ion - ring complex .",
    "the details of this mechanism can be found in the classical paper by rayfield and reif@xcite ( see also the work by nancolas , bowley , and mcclintock@xcite and donnely s monographs@xcite ) .",
    "while attempting , initially , to repeat the experimental conditions of the work by davis , hendry , and mcclintock@xcite , who tried to eliminate nucleation of vortex rings by ions , walmsley , golov and their co - authors eventually came to a conclusion that at low temperatures charged rings are preferable as proble particles .",
    "the trapping cross - section of the charged ring is of the order of its diameter , @xmath156@xcite , which is much larger than the trapping cross - section of the bare ion bubble , and hence it is considerably easier to detect quantized vortices by charged rings ( as was stated much earlier by guenin and hess@xcite ) .",
    "some disadvantage of using charged vortex rings is their dynamics which is more complicated than that of bare ion bubbles ( we refer the reader to the theoretical studies@xcite ) .",
    "the experimental studies@xcite of walmsley _",
    "_ showed that using charged rings rather than bare ions it is possible to detect the change in the vortex line density upon starting and stopping rotation at temperatures from 0.5 down to @xmath157 .",
    "monitoring in ref .",
    "@xcite the trapping of charged rings by rectilinear vortices generated by slow rotation the authors were able to measure the ring - vortex trapping cross - section at these temperatures . furthermore , at low temperatures injection of charged rings can be used to create a vortex tangle@xcite .",
    "an application of this technique to the study of quantum turbulence in the limit @xmath61 has already brought some non - trivial results .",
    "thus , walmsley _ _ et al.__@xcite studied , at temperatures from 1.6 down to @xmath158 , a decay of the homogeneous vortex tangle produced by a sudden spin down of the rotating cell .",
    "they found that the decay of the energy flux , @xmath28 is the same as that of the classical turbulence at high reynolds numbers , i.e. @xmath159 , and that the vortex line density decays as @xmath160 .",
    "most importantly , it was found that at @xmath161 the effective kinematic viscosity , @xmath162 drops sharply from the value @xmath163 and approaches @xmath164 as @xmath61 .",
    "the authors linked this drop to the transition to the new form of turbulence , the so - called `` ultraquantum '' ( or `` vinen '' as opposed to the classical , `` kolmogorov '' ) turbulence .",
    "this , less structured than ( quasi)classical regime of turbulence is characterized by the cascade in which the energy is transferred to smaller scales by kelvin waves on individual vortex lines ( and , therefore , by the absence of any large scale motion ) .",
    "the mechanism of energy dissipation is though to be acoustic : smallest perturbations are emitted as phonons .",
    "clearly , the ultraquantum regime should be characterized by an effective kinematic viscosity , @xmath165 different from the quasiclassical @xmath162 .",
    "it should be emphasized , though , that the regime of turbulence in the cited work@xcite was essentially quasiclassical due to forcing at large scales ( rotation ) .",
    "the existence and properties of ultraquantum regime at temperatures below @xmath166 were addressed a year later in the recent work of walmsley and golov@xcite .",
    "the vortex tangle with was produced not by spin down of the rotating scale but by charged vortex rings so that no large - scale flow was generated .",
    "it was found that in the ultraquantum regime the vortex line density decays as @xmath167 , and that the effective kinematic viscosity of the vinen turbulence is @xmath168 .    in conclusion of this section",
    "we would like to emphasize that the considered so far two experimental techniques of visualization ( or , at least , detection ) of flow properties in turbulent @xmath0he , i.e piv / particle tracking and the ion trapping technique do not compete but rather complement each other .",
    "indeed , the ion trapping technique detects quantized vortices without disturbing the flow , and it is efficient in the low temperature regime ; at temperatures above @xmath135 ion bubbles can no longer be trapped on quantized vortices .",
    "as strongly emphasized by charalambous _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite , the obvious disadvantage of this technique is that ion bubbles `` can not provide the kind of detailed information about turbulent flow patterns that is available in the case of classical turbulence '' .",
    "we fully endorse this statement .",
    "actual visualization of quantized vortex filaments is also hardly possible ( but see some new developments discussed below ) . on the contrary , solid",
    ", micron - size particles being used in the piv and particle tracking techniques , albeit disturbing the flow , can visualize the normal flow and can even be used to `` paint '' quantized vortices .",
    "however , as was demonstrated in secs .",
    "[ instability ] and [ tto0 ] , in the low temperature regime , as @xmath61 solid particles do not follow the flow , and , as was shown in sec .",
    "[ temperature ] , most likely can not be trapped on quantized vortices .    in the remainder of this chapter",
    "we will briefly discuss two new promising techniques that potentially can be used for direct flow visualization .",
    "the first of these methods is being developed at brown university by maris and his colleagues@xcite .",
    "the idea of the method comes from the fact that an application of a negative pressure to @xmath0he leads to an increase of the radius of the ion bubble which explodes , and its size grows substantially when the negative pressure has reached the critical value , @xmath169 .",
    "furthermore , maris _ et al . _ argue that since the pressure around the quantized vortex is reduced due to the bernoulli effect , the ion bubbles trapped on the vortex have the size larger than those in the bulk of @xmath0he and explode at the critical pressure of smaller magnitude ( hence the possibility of direct distinguishing the bubbles trapped on vortices from those in the bulk of helium ) . in these experiments",
    "the pressure variations were produced by an acoustic , ultrasonic transducer generating either focused or planar ( as in the last of cited works ) sound wave . by choosing a suitable frequency and amplitude of the emitted sound",
    ", bubbles can be make so large that they can be visualized by the conventional optical methods ( e.g. by a laser beam and a photomultiplier ) .",
    "the other advantage of this method is that it uses neither emission of the electron beam nor the electric field to accelerate the ions .",
    "the charged particles are those that already present in the bulk of @xmath0he , either as a result of direct ionization by e.g. cosmic rays , or through the more complicated process involving ionization , production of uv photons , and ejection of electrons from the walls into helium by the photoelectric effect .",
    "the absence of the applied electric field means that electron bubbles , unless they are trapped on quantized vortices , will faithfully follow the normal flow .",
    "indeed , the results of visualization showed that in the weak , laminar counterflow most of the bubbles moved along the streamlines of the normal fluid , but alongside those about 10% of the observed electron bubbles followed snakelike paths ; these could be assumed the electron bubbles trapped by vortices and sliding along vortex filaments .",
    "so far no new information on quantum turbulence has been obtained using this technique , but its relative simplicity has a potential to make it a tool competing with the piv and particle tracking techniques .",
    "another , completely new visualization technique is currently being developed by mckinsey and his co - workers@xcite at yale university .",
    "this technique employs metastable @xmath4 triplet molecules , produced e.g. by the radioactive source , which can be excited by two infrared photons from the ground @xmath170 state to the @xmath171 .",
    "about 90% of the excited molecules will decay into @xmath172 state emitting photons at @xmath173 well separated in the wavelength from the excitation photons and hence can be detected by standard techniques .",
    "all excited molecules decay back to the ground state within about @xmath174 , so that the process can be repeated many times to make possible a detection of a single molecule .",
    "the authors claim that @xmath4 molecules should be unaffected by quantized vortices at temperatures above @xmath175 and so allow the resolution of the normal flow even at the kolmogorov scale .",
    "however , vinen commented@xcite that at sufficiently low temperatures triplet molecules may as well become trapped on quantized vortex core . in this case",
    "three - dimensional images of vortex lines can be produced by e.g. stereoscopic imaging .",
    "if successful , the further development of this method may be useful for recovering the velocity field and probability distribution function of the normal velocity fluctuations , and can also provide a new , nonintrusive tool for visualization of quantized vortices .",
    "this article reviewed the recent progress in understanding the motion of solid particles and mechanisms of their interactions with both the normal fluid and quantized vortices in turbulent @xmath0he .",
    "this problem is addressed in the context of the piv and the particle tracking techniques recently implemented in @xmath0he , although we were certainly biased ( perhaps , not surprisingly , considered our own research expertise ) towards theoretical and numerical works and interpretation of experimental results .",
    "the problem of the interaction of particle tracers with the normal fluid and with quantized vortices is difficult , at least in principle : it is three - dimensional , time dependent and strongly nonlinear .",
    "this is why the best model available ( the two - way coupling model described in section 3 ) is computationally very expensive . in this review",
    "we have shown that , fortunately , some aspects of this particle - vortex interaction can be understood using simpler models , either numerical or analytical , particularly given the insight gained from the two - way coupling model .",
    "although implemented recently ( the first publications date 2002 ) , the piv and the particle tracking techniques applied to the problem of quantum turbulence in @xmath0he had already produced some new results . among them : the discovery of large - scale eddies , which do not have an analogue in the classical fluid dynamics , in the thermal counterflow past a cylinder ; the wider and flatter , compared to classical , velocity profile in the turbulent boundary layer ; scaling for the time evolution of the parameter characterizing reconnections of quantized vortices ; non - gaussian probability distribution function , with the tail scaled as @xmath115 , of the velocity i decaying quantum turbulence .",
    "these results seem to suggest that both the piv and the particle tracking techniques have great potential for studying quantum turbulence .",
    "besides , the motion of solid particles in turbulent @xmath0he seems to be itself an interesting and non - trivial phenomenon worth the detailed theoretical and experimental study .",
    "although the review of this rapidly development area of research can not be comprehensive , we attempted to resolve , where possible , contradictions in theoretical interpretations of recent experimental observations and to address yet unresolved issues .",
    "we also reviewed the related experimental methods , first of all the ion trapping technique which is perhaps the main tool for studying quantized vortices in the low temperature limit .",
    "we argue that these two experimental methods , i.e. the piv / particle tracking and the ion trapping techniques do not compete but complement each other .",
    "indeed , each of these techniques is most efficient in its own temperature and flow regime .",
