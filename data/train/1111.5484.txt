    "in this paper , we study binary linear @xmath0 $ ] codes ( codes of length @xmath1 and dimension @xmath2 ) used for error detection on the binary symmetric channel . a comprehensive introduction to the field",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "the basic definitions are given in section [ sub : errordetection ] .",
    "a main quantity is the _ probability of undetected error _ of a code .",
    "if the probability of undetected error is an increasing function on the interval @xmath3 $ ] , the code is known as _ proper _ for error detection .",
    "it is believed that proper codes exist for all lengths @xmath1 and dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "however , this has been shown only for some cases .",
    "in particular , proper @xmath0 $ ] codes are known to exist for any given @xmath2 when @xmath1 is sufficiently large . the best known result in this direction",
    "was given by klve and yari @xcite who showed that proper codes exist for @xmath4    in this paper , we study a particular class of @xmath0 $ ] codes where @xmath5 .",
    "one of our results is that these codes are proper for many values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 where the existence of proper codes was previously unknown . in particular , we improve the bound ( [ kybound ] ) .",
    "we first consider @xmath1 in the range @xmath6 .",
    "the hamming bound proves that the dual of an @xmath0 $ ] code in this case has minimum distance at most 3 .",
    "moreover , an @xmath7 $ ] code with minimum distance 3 can be obtained by shortening the @xmath8 $ ] hamming code .",
    "two @xmath0 $ ] codes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are equivalent if there exists a permutation @xmath11 of @xmath12 such that @xmath13 if two codes are equivalent , then it may happen that the corresponding ( repeatedly ) punctured codes are not equivalent .",
    "let @xmath14 be some @xmath15 matrix having as columns all possible nonzero vectors of length @xmath2 .",
    "the code generated by @xmath14 is the simplex code @xmath16 , and the code having @xmath14 as parity check matrix is the well - known hamming code .",
    "note that the order of the columns is not specified ; all the equivalent codes are named hamming codes .",
    "however , when we want to puncture the code , the order is very important .",
    "we remind the reader that puncturing a code is equivalent to shortening the dual code .",
    "davydov et al .",
    "@xcite determined an ordering of the columns in @xmath14 such that any of the corresponding ( repeatedly ) shortened codes contains a minimal number of codewords of weight three ; the shortened @xmath7 $ ] codes are obtained by removing @xmath17 columns from @xmath14 to get a @xmath18 matrix @xmath19 and use this matrix as the parity check matrix for the @xmath7 $ ] code .",
    "they showed that a possible choice of @xmath19 is to have as columns the vectors that are the binary representation of the numbers from @xmath20 down to @xmath21 .",
    "for example @xmath22    we let @xmath23 denote the code generated by @xmath19 . for our investigation",
    ", we will consider codes that are equivalent ( but not equal ) to these codes ; we will denote them by @xmath24 .",
    "a main reason for considering @xmath24 rather than @xmath23 is that the determination of the weight distribution is easier for @xmath24 .    in this paper , we investigate the performance of the codes @xmath24 when they are used for error detection .",
    "we compute their weight distribution that , in turn , permits us to calculate the undetected error probability @xmath25 .",
    "however , when the code length @xmath1 is large ( @xmath26 ) , the polynomial expressing @xmath25 may be difficult to evaluate , even when the weight distribution is known .",
    "for this reason , in the general case , we also find bounds on the length and dimension such that a necessary condition for codes to be satisfactory does not hold , using a method similar to the one proposed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sub : errordetection ] we give some preliminaries on error detection ; in section [ sub : dkstconstruction ] we describe the construction of @xmath24 and show that @xmath24 and @xmath23 are equivalent ; in section [ sec : weights - distribution ] we determine the weight distribution of @xmath24 ; in section [ sec : prob ] we study the undetected error probability of @xmath24 and its dual code ; in section [ sec : approximate - analysis ] we give an asymptotic analysis ; in section [ sec : generalization ] we give a generalization of the construction to lenghts @xmath27 , finally , in section [ sec : results ] we summarize our results .",
    "we start by defining @xmath28 , the undetected error probability for an @xmath0 $ ] code @xmath9 when used on the binary symmetric channel with error probability @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of codewords having hamming weight @xmath32 , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.1.2 ) .",
    "one can also express this polynomial in terms of the weight distribution of the dual code , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) .",
    "if @xmath33 is the number of codewords having hamming weight @xmath32 in the dual code @xmath34 , we have : @xmath35    as mentioned in the introduction , if @xmath28 is an increasing function on @xmath36 $ ] , the code @xmath9 is called _ proper _ for error detection . if @xmath37 for every @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath9 is called _ good _ for error detection .",
    "if @xmath39 for every @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath9 is called _ satisfactory _ for error detection , see @xcite .",
    "a code that is not satisfactory is called _",
    "ugly_. when a code is proper then it is satisfactory ; so , if it is ugly it is clearly not proper ( nor good ) .",
    "we first describe a particular parity check matrix @xmath14 for the hamming code . for @xmath40 ,",
    "let @xmath41 be the @xmath42 matrix constructed as follows :    * the first @xmath43 rows are all - zero vectors .",
    "* row @xmath44 is the all - one vector . * in the @xmath45 matrix consisting of the last @xmath46 rows , the columns are ordered lexicographically .",

    "we see that @xmath54 is the first order reed - muller code and @xmath55 , the simplex code .",
    "both of these codes are known to be proper ( and this is easy to show ) .",
    "the hamming code is @xmath56 .",
    "the code having @xmath52 as parity check matrix is a shortened hamming code which we denote by @xmath57 .",
    "we note that @xmath58 . in the rest of the paper ( except section [ sec : generalization ] ) we will assume that @xmath59 .",
    "[ dkst - bs ] the codes @xmath24 and @xmath23 are equivalent .",
    "we first illustrate by the example @xmath48 and @xmath60 , that is , the matrices ( [ h4 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) . adding the second row in ( [ h4 ] ) to the third and forth rows , we get @xmath61 this is an alternative generator matrix for @xmath62 .",
    "the last three columns are the same in ( [ hh4 ] ) and ( [ d4 ] ) , and the first eight columns of ( [ hh4 ] ) are a permutation of the first eight columns in ( [ d4 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are equivalent .    in the general case , if @xmath64 $ ] for some @xmath46 , @xmath65 , we add row @xmath66 in @xmath52 to all the rows below .",
    "this gives an alternative generator matrix @xmath67 for @xmath24 .",
    "the first @xmath68 columns of @xmath67 are a permutation of the binary representations of @xmath69 $ ] , the next @xmath70 columns of @xmath67 are a permutation of the binary representations of @xmath71 $ ] , etc .",
    "the final @xmath72 columns in @xmath67 and @xmath19 are the same .",
    "hence , @xmath24 and @xmath23 are equivalent .",
    "if @xmath73 for some @xmath46 , @xmath74 , the same argument shows that the columns of @xmath52 are a permutation of the columns of @xmath19 , and so again @xmath24 and @xmath23 are equivalent .",
    "the main question we consider is : for which @xmath1 and @xmath2 is @xmath24 proper for error detection ? we will also in some cases consider the simpler question : for which @xmath1 and @xmath2 is @xmath24 satisfactory for error detection ?",
    "we note that this is equivalent to the question : for which @xmath1 and @xmath2 is @xmath57 satisfactory for error detection ?",
    "the reason is the following known lemma .",

    "a code is satisfactory if and only if the dual code is satisfactory .    to determine the probability of undetected error for @xmath24",
    ", we have to determine its weight distribution .",
    "this is done in this section .",
    "we break the argument down into a number of lemmas .",
    "we first give some further notations .",
    "we observe that the matrix @xmath75\\ ] ] has length @xmath76    for a given @xmath1 , let @xmath46 be determined by @xmath77 since @xmath78 , we have @xmath65 .",

    "the columns in @xmath84 are ordered lexicographically and so ( [ alr ] ) follows .",
    "let @xmath86 denote the weight of the @xmath87-th row in @xmath52 . as usual",

    "[ w - lemma1 ] let @xmath80 . then @xmath90 and @xmath91 if @xmath92 and @xmath93 , then @xmath94 if @xmath92 and @xmath95 ,",
    "then @xmath96    all the rows of @xmath14 have weight @xmath68 .",
    "the first @xmath46 rows of @xmath52 are obtained from rows in @xmath14 removing some zeros .",
    "hence @xmath97 for @xmath98 .",
    "before we go on with the proof , let us take a closer look at @xmath41 .",
    "row @xmath99 consists of consecutive blocks of zeros and ones , each block of length @xmath100 .",
    "we use the term _",
    "double block _ for a zero - block combined with the following one - block ; it has length @xmath101 .",
    "now , let @xmath102 then row @xmath87 in @xmath52 consists of @xmath103 double blocks of length @xmath101 , each of weight @xmath100 , followed by an incomplete double block of length @xmath104 that has to be considered further ( when @xmath105 , the incomplete double block is , of course , a full double block ) .    if @xmath93 , the incomplete double block is all zero , and so ( [ wm2 ] ) follows .    if @xmath95 , the incomplete double block consists of a full block ( of length @xmath100 ) of zeros followed by an incomplete block of ones of length @xmath106 .",
