    "coupled oscillators and their synchronization phenomena are ubiquitously found in a variety of scientific and engineering fields  @xcite .",
    "they are typical examples of nonequilibrium dissipative systems that are maintained by a balance of energy injection and dissipation .",
    "the relationship between synchronization and energy dissipation has been attracting much interest , e.g. , in the context of low reynolds - number hydrodynamics  @xcite since taylor s classical work on hydrodynamic synchronization of active objects with periodic motions  @xcite .",
    "recent extensive theoretical and experimental studies on beating eukaryotic flagella and cilia have elucidated the underlying physical mechanism of hydrodynamic synchronization based on a simplified phase - description without losing its essence  @xcite . in this phase - description , they are simply modeled as coupled oscillators whose periodic motions are described by phase equations .",
    "these tiny oscillators are motive - powered by a collection of molecular machines that convert chemical energy into mechanical work in a noisy thermal environment  @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic flow generated by such beating flagella and cilia plays a vital and versatile role in living organisms , utilized , e.g. , in the motility of sperm and material transport by metachronal waves  @xcite .",
    "one important aspect is to understand how synchronization and desynchronization between the oscillators that operate in a noisy environment affect energy dissipation . to develop this energetics of synchronization , we need to unify energetic concepts usually treated in thermodynamics with the theory of coupled oscillators usually treated in nonlinear dynamics .",
    "such a unification from the stochastic thermodynamics point of view  @xcite has been developed , in the analysis of collective dynamics based on a nonequilibrium equality  @xcite and in the optimization of the energy - conversion efficiency in all - to - all coupled many - oscillators systems  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the relationship between synchronization and energy dissipation rate for the simplest and prototypical case of coupled oscillators rotating on circular trajectories described by phase equations via stochastic thermodynamics .",
    "while the difficulty of estimating the energy dissipation rate comes from the fact that these oscillators can not be treated independently , we nevertheless can derive a concise and general expression of the energy dissipation rate for them , which can be applied to any type of weak coupling .",
    "our expression elucidates the relationship between synchronization and energy dissipation rate , where the decomposition of the coupling function into the even and odd parts , which express the effect on collective and relative dynamics , respectively , has a key role . from this decomposition",
    ", we reveal that the contribution from the odd part always decreases the dissipation upon frequency synchronization , while the contribution from the even part yields a characteristic square - root change of the dissipation near the bifurcation point whose sign depends on the specific system parameters .",
