    "the principal component analysis ( pca ) is a powerful statistical method , if the observational data contain several variables @xcite .",
    "if there are some correlations among the variables , then pca lowers the number of variables needed for the description of the dataset without any essential loss of generality .",
    "it introduces the quantities called principal components ( pcs ) .",
    "then one can omit some pcs not leading to essential loss of information about the dataset ( for more details about pca see @xcite ) .",
    "in the topic of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) the paper @xcite used pca on the dataset of batse catalog  @xcite .",
    "this catalog contains nine measured variables in the gamma - band alone ( three different peak fluxes , the four fluences in the four different energy channels , and the two durations ) for any grb .",
    "@xcite has shown that from these nine variables only three ones are also enough ( one of the durations , a combination of the fluences and the peak fluxes , and the fluence on the highest energy channel alone ) .",
    "as far as it is known , since 1998 no further pca was applied on any grbs datasets .",
    "this is remarkable , because for the dozens of grbs further observational quantities are also known from the analyses of spectra and from the afterglow ( ag ) data .",
    "thus , the usefulness of such generalized pca is a triviality .",
    "this contribution presents the preliminary results of a new pca , in which more variables than in @xcite are included .    in jochen greiner s list @xcite ,",
    "up to september 30 , 2004 , there are 38 grbs with known redshift @xmath1 : for grb980329 and grb011030x there are upper limits only , and in one case @xmath1 is queried ( grb980326 ) .",
    "these 41 grbs define the primary sample here .    for every grb in our sample we will consider 8 variables : @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , ag@xmath3 , @xmath4 , ag@xmath0 , @xmath5 and fluence .",
    "the last two variables are the usual @xmath5 durations and fluences used already in batse catalog .",
    "the indices @xmath0 and @xmath2 are the slopes in band s spectrum , @xmath4 defines the photon energy , where the band spectrum @xmath6 peaks ( @xmath7 is the fluence from infinitesimal photon energy interval @xmath8 ) .",
    "these three variables define the spectrum of grbs .",
    "ag@xmath3 is the observed time ( in days ) , when the power - law decay of ag changes into a faster decay ; the slope of the decay before this ag@xmath3 is denoted as ag@xmath0 .",
    "( this slope is usually denoted also as @xmath0 , but using this notation there would be a confusion with the spectrum s",
    "slope @xmath0 . )",
    "all this means that we have taken only two variables from batse catalog ( the @xmath5 duration and fluence ) , which in essence defined the two pcs in @xcite .",
    "the third pc of batse catalog , namely the fluence at the highest energy channel , will not be considered here , because for this channel the data are often vanishing and/or noisy .",
    "our main aim here is to obtain informations and conclusions about the six remaining new quantities , not about the batse values themselves ; hence , it is better not to consider here the fluence at the highest energy channel .",
    "there are 16 grbs from the mentioned 41 grbs that have all these variables in the greiner s list .",
    "these 16 grbs define the net sample for our pca . for fluence , @xmath5 , ag@xmath3 ( days ) , @xmath9 and @xmath4 we will take the logarithms of the measured values .",
    "pca needs , first , the calculation of correlations among the variables . the following pairs ( with the corresponding probabilities @xmath10 )",
    "give strong correlations : @xmath11 - @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath12 - @xmath0 ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 - @xmath11 ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 - @xmath11 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath17 - @xmath15 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "all other correlations are weaker .",
    "the second step in pca is to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "pca gives us the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the `` best '' projection ( table 1 ) ..    then the third step in pca is to define the important pcs . in accordance with @xcite",
    "the important pcs are that ones , which have eigenvalues above @xmath20 . from table 1",
    "we obtain the result that only 3 pcs are important .",
    "this is a highly remarkable conclusion : we have 8 variables , and their reduction to 3 is an essential lowering .",
    "in addition , two pcs were expected already from the earlier paper @xcite , because these two pcs were given by the batse data alone . in other words , the 6 new quantities -",
    "not used already in @xcite - define only one further new important pc .",
    ".pca result . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is seen from table 1 , the first three eigenvectors ( comp1 - 3 ) are the linear combination of @xmath17 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 , @xmath12 , @xmath0 , @xmath21 and ag@xmath0 .",
    "no variable alone is dominating in these pcs .",
    "all this means that , beyond the two pcs coming from the batse catalog , there is only one further important pc , and this one is a complicated linear combination of all variables . in other words : although the correlations among the variables are generally weak , these correlations are enough to ensure a coupling among the variables .",
    "the @xmath17+@xmath11+@xmath15 correlation is well - known .",
    "this correlation in essence ensures that @xmath17 alone is not independent .",
    "the correlation @xmath12 and @xmath0 is also ensures that the redshift alone is also _ not _ independent - a quite remarkable behavior .",
    "( as it is seen on figure 1 , the positive correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath0 is obvious , because the trend - increasing of @xmath1 with increasing @xmath0 - is well seen .",
    "contrary this , no such trend is seen between @xmath1 @xmath2 . ) similarly , the remaining correlations are enough to lower the number of important variables .",
    "distribution of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 values of the net data.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    note still that , interestingly , @xmath2 stands practically alone in fourth pc ( comp4 ) .",
    "hence , the only variable , which can define _ alone _ a pc , is the quantity @xmath2 .",
    "but , in accordance with @xcite , this pc has already an eigenvalue smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "the importance of pca is given also by the fact that it uses exclusively the observational data , and any model of grbs must respect the reduction of important variables . here",
    "we briefly discuss the consequences of pca on the models of grbs .",
    "the prompt emission in grbs can in most cases be described by various models of optically - thin synchrotron emission .",
    "theoretical considerations suggest that , apart from this non - thermal emission , a thermal emission component , from the photosphere of the outflow , could be equally strong in the gamma - ray band  @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was found that the observed spectra can indeed be described by a thermal black - body superimposed on a non - thermal spectrum .",
    "the relative strengths of these two components vary .",
    "a large @xmath0 is measured if the thermal component is dominant , while a lower value ( more like a synchrotron value ) is found if the non - thermal component dominates .",
    "the variations in @xmath0 therefore could suggest a variation in importance of the photosphere .",
    "note that @xmath0 values are measured on the _ integrated _ spectra .",
    "these are necessarily softer than the instantaneous spectra  @xcite .",
    "it is the instantaneous spectrum that reflects the physical radiation process shaping the spectrum .",
    "we therefore have that @xmath22 .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 therefore suggests that the thermal component becomes more dominant at larger redshifts . in @xcite",
    "it was showed that a combination of the variation time scale at the central engine and the dimension - less entropy of the outflow determines this relation .",
    "low variability at the central engine combined with large lorentz factors should therefore have been dominant at large redshifts .",
    "@xcite also found this @xmath0 vs. @xmath9 correlation .",
    "they explained it in terms of the @xmath23 correlation , where @xmath24 is the total emitted energy of grbs .",
    "pca method indicates that three pcs are enough to describe the variability of the data .",
    "hence , a reduction of the eight variables into three is strongly suggested .",
    "the strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath9 suggests that the thermal emission component becomes more dominant at larger redshifts .",
    "thanks are due to the valuable discussions with claes - ingvar bjrnsson , istvn csabai , claes fransson , johan peter uldall fynbo , peter mszros and gbor tusndy .",
