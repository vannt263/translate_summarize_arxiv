    "this most studied allotrope of iron becomes , however , unstable above 1183  k because of the structural phase transition to the @xmath0phase  @xcite , which has a face centered cubic ( fcc ) crystal structure  @xcite .",
    "the theory of the @xmath1@xmath0 structural transition is still under development .",
    "recent investigations  @xcite have shown an important role of magnetic correlations for this transition .",

    "experimentally the temperature dependence of inverse magnetic susceptibility in @xmath0 phase has a very weak slope , which can not be determined to a good accuracy because of large spread of experimental data ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "the paramagnetic curie temperature , extracted from a fit to experimental data is negative , @xmath14  k , and the corresponding magnetic moment is about @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the magnetic properties of @xmath0iron are very different from those of @xmath1-iron , where the paramagnetic curie temperature is positive , @xmath16  k , and the magnetic moment is much smaller , @xmath17@xcite",
    ".    at low temperatures the magnetically ordered fcc phase does not exist as a single crystal due to structural phase transition .",
    "nevertheless magnetically ordered state can be studied in iron precipitates in copper matrix that have the same fcc crystal structure with slightly different lattice parameter .",
    "the first measurements of the magnetic properties of @xmath0fe precipitates were carried out in 1960s by abrahams _",

    "the value of wilson  sommerfeld ratio , @xmath21 , can not be directly found from magnetic and calorimetric measurements since pure @xmath0iron does not exist as large crystal at low temperatures .",
    "for a rough estimation of @xmath22 the available high - temperature value of the uniform spin susceptibility can be used , @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the sommerfeld specific heat coefficient @xmath0 was measured for different fcc alloys in a wide range of component concentrations@xcite .",
    "the maximal value of specific heat coefficient is in antiferromagnetic fe : mn alloy , @xmath24 mj/(mol@xmath25k@xmath26 ) .",

    "two above opposite limits cover the situation in the presence or absence of magnetic fluctuations in alloys .",
    "therefore one finds wilson  sommerfeld ratio in range @xmath28 , which points to the presence of strong ferromagnetic fluctuations , whether or not the magnetic contiribution to the specific heat is taken into account , and indicates that the ( antiferro)magnetism in @xmath0iron is likely to be frustrated by the competing magnetic fluctuations .",

    "similar results were obtained within augmented spherical wave method  @xcite . using tb - lmto - asa method james _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a stability of different magnetic structures with increasing of the volume and found the following sequence of magnetic phase transitions : low - spin fm @xmath33 3*k * structure @xmath34 double - layered afm @xmath35 triple - layered afm @xmath36 high - spin fm .",
    "the calculations within disordered local moments approximation gave a metastable solution with slightly higher energy .",
    "at the same time , spin molecular dynamics calculations , based on first - principles kohn - sham spectra  @xcite , applied for the @xmath0-iron yielded the following transitions : 2*k * superimposed ss with @xmath37 double - layered afm @xmath38 fm .",
    "krling and ergon  @xcite analyzed the importance of the full potential scheme and replacement of the local spin density approximation by the generalized gradient one .",

    "sjstedt and nordstrm  @xcite demonstrated that the use of the full potential scheme with non - collinear approach for intra atomic magnetization is more important for the proper description of the magnetic ground state than applying different approximations for exchange correlation potential .",
    "they found the ss ground state with the wave vector , @xmath41 .",
    "one can see that quite generally the results for the type of the magnetic ground state in @xmath0-iron strongly depend on the value of lattice parameter and approximations made for account of intra atomic magnetic structure and interaction potential which may point to a close competition of different magnetic states in this material .",
    "recent analysis  @xcite within the ab - initio ss approach have also shown presence of long - range competing exchange interactions which strongly depend on the lattice parameter .",
    "the calculations of the paramagnetic state were performed within a disordered local moment approach ( dlm ) by many authors  @xcite who compared the stability of the paramagnetic solution versus different ss states depending on volume .",
    "it was found that the dlm solution lies always higher in energy with respect to the ordered state regardless the lattice parameter value  @xcite .",
    "one should remember that dlm is the approach on top of density functional theory to treat paramagnetic ground state and therefore it does not consider correlation effects .",
    "although the paramagnetic solution obtained with dlm can be stable at higher temperatures its treatment requires other methods , which necessarily include correlation effects .",
    "a possible approach for obtaining temperature evolution of magnetic properties with account of correlation effects is a combination of local density approximation ( lda ) with the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
