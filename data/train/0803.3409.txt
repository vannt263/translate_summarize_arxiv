    "the relation between jets and accretion processes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is one of the most fundamental and open problems . in current theoretical models of the formation of the jet ,",
    "the power is through accretion and then extracted from the disk / black hole spin energy and converted in the kinetic power of the jet ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford & payne 1982 ; maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ) . in both cases",
    "the magnetic field play a major role in channelling power from the black hole spin or disk into the jet , in both scenarios it should be sustained by matter accreting onto the black hole , leading one to expect a relation between accretion power and jet power ( maraschi et al . 2003 ; xie et al .",
    "recently , the concept of jet - disk symbiosis was introduced ( cao & jiang 1999 ) .",
    "the relativistic jet model plus mass and energy conservation in the jet - disk system was applied to study the relation between disk and jet luminosities ( cao & jiang 1999 ; falcke & biermanm 1995 ; falcke , malkan & biemann 1995 ) . an effective approach to explore the link between the mentioned above two phenomena is to study the relation between broad - line emission luminosity and jet power at different wavelength ( dai et al .",
    "2007 ; cao & jiang 1999 ; maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ; celotti , padovani & ghisellini 1997 ; serjeant et al . 1998 ; xu et al . 1999 ; xie et al . 2007 ) .",
    "celotti , padovani & ghisellini ( 1997 ) considered a large sample of radio - loud objects , and derived the accretion luminosity from the broad emission lines when available .",
    "they explored the relation between the disk and jet using the correlation between the broad - line luminosity and kinetic power .",
    "the kinetic power of jets can be estimated by using the direct radio emission data of the jets close the nucleus , as resolved by very - long - baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) and the standard synchrotron self - compton theory of celotti & fabian ( 1993 ) .",
    "they found evidence for a link between jets and disks , although the statistical significance was too low to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "cao & jiang ( 1999 ) found a significant correlation between radio and broad - line emission for a sample of radio - loud quasars that supports a close link between accretion processes and relativistic jets .",
    "it is well known that blazars are in fact the best laboratories to study the physics of relativistic jets . for a small sample of blazars ,",
    "maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 ) also found a significant correlation between the luminosity carried by relativistic jets and the nuclear luminosity provided by accretion , using the good - quality broadband x - ray data provided by the bepposax satellite .",
    "their results also support a close accretion on to a rapidly spinning central black hole .",
    "however , in a flux - limited sample that covers a wide range of redshift , a correlation can appear in luminosity even though there is no intrinsic correlation in the sources because the luminosity is strongly correlated with redshift ( mcke et al .",
    "1997 ) . in order to avoid the redshift bias to data ,",
    "in this paper we will discuss correlations between flux densities ( and the corresponding luminosities ) in different wave bands because they are less susceptible to such distortions .    in this paper , for a large sample of blazars",
    ", we study the correlations of the broad - line flux with x - ray flux , optical flux and radio flux , respectively , and the correlations of the broad - line luminosity with x - ray luminosity , optical luminosity and radio luminosity , respectively . the cosmological parameters @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 have been adopted in this work .",
    "based on the catalogue of blazars compiled by donato et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the catalogue of the broad emission line information of radio - loud sources compiled by cao & jiang ( 1999 ) , we compiled a sample of 50 blazars , for which the total broad - line flux ( erg @xmath8s@xmath6 ) , x - ray flux at 1 kev in @xmath9jy , optical flux at 5500   and radio flux at 5 ghz given by cao & jiang ( 1999 ) and donato et al .",

    "for the remaining 24 objects , we can not be certain whether they are in a high state or low state . in the following analysis",
    ", we will consider two possible cases : ( 1 ) assuming them to be in a high state , and ( 2 ) assuming them to be a low state .",

    "according to ghisellini ( 2006 ) , if relativistic jets are powered ( at least initially ) by a poynting flux , one can derive a simple expression for the maximum value of their power , under some reasonable assumptions .",
    "the blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) power can be written as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the luminosity , @xmath64 is the mass of black hole , @xmath65 is the solar mass , @xmath66 is the specific black hole angular momentum(@xmath67 for maximally rotating black holes ) , and b is the magnetic strength in units of gauss . assuming that the value of magnetic energy density @xmath68 close to black hole is a fraction @xmath69 of the available gravitational energy : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the schwarzschild radius .",
    "based on the accretion disk theory the mass density @xmath72 is linked to the accretion rate @xmath73 through @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the radial in falling velocity , @xmath76 is the disk thickness . as in stars ,",
    "the fundamental process at work in an active nucleus is the conversion of mass to energy .",
    "this is done with some efficiency @xmath77 , the mass accretion rate @xmath78 is linked to the observed luminosity produced by the accretion disk @xmath79 from equations ( 7 ) , ( 8) , ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , the blandford - znajek jet power can be written as : @xmath80 the maximum jet power can be written as ( ghisellini 2006 ) : @xmath81 in addition , on the basis of present theories of accretion disk , the broad - line region ( blr ) is photoionized by a nuclear source ( probably radiation from the disk ) , maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 ) obtained @xmath82 where @xmath83 represents the fraction of the central emission reprocessed by the blr , usually assumed to be 0.1 . from equation ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , we have @xmath84 it is well known that according to the accretion disk theory , @xmath4 is not a constant .",
    "it ranges from 0.057 to 0.42 .",
    "however in our previous works ( xie et al . 2002 ; 2003 ) , one prove that the central black hole of blazars are probably kerr black holes",
    ". its range should be narrow ( xie et al . 2005 ) . from equation",
    "( 14 ) , we can have @xmath85 from the equation ( 15 ) , we can see that the theoretical predictions are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the slope of @xmath47-@xmath86 linear relation should be 1 .",
    "@xmath4 is an important physical parameter .",
    "( 2 ) since @xmath4 is not the same for all objects , @xmath87 will contribute to the dispersion around the linear relation .",
    "from fig . 1 to fig . 8 and table 2 , we can see that the straight lines of linear regression equations of bl lac parallel almost the straight line of linear regression equations of fsrqs in x - ray , optical and radio bands , respectively .",
    "however bl lac objects systematically lie somewhat below the fsrqs . on the other hand",
    "it is worth noting that there is very strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in both states for all 50 blazars , and there are also significant correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath11 , and between @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the slopes of the straight lines of all linear regression equations of blazars in x - ray , optical and radio bands are also close to 1 . on the basis of the theoretical results of equation ( 15 ) and the empirical results mentioned above , we seem to obtain following implications .",
    "( 1 ) the coupling between the jet and accretion disk of blazars is very close , leading to the fact that @xmath0 correlate significantly with multi - wave band fluxes .",
    "( 2 ) bl lac objects are a subclass of blazars which have low accretion coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "( 3 ) fsrqs are also a subclass of blazars which have high accretion coefficient @xmath4 .",
    "( 4 ) these results seem to show that fsrqs and bl lac objects should be regarded as a class which shows blazar behavior ( xie et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ) .",
    "( 5 ) the correlation between disk and jet emission does not depend on the emission state of the agn .",
    "the idea of the unification of fsrqs and bl lac objects is confirmed by a new independent evidence .",
    "it is very interesting to note that if we compare our results with the theoretical models of ghisellini ( 2006 ) and maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 ) .",
    "we can see that our experimental results are consistent with the theoretical prediction of equation ( 15 ) in section 5 of this paper , this is , these results mentioned above ( both the experimental and the theoretical ) suggest a close link between the formation of relativistic jet and accretion on to the central kerr black hole .",
    "thus , we provide a solid basis for these theoretical speculations of ghisellini ( 2006 ) and maraschi & tavecchio ( 2003 ) .    from table 2",
    ", one can see that there are very strong correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 or between @xmath11 and @xmath0 in all cases .",
    "however , there is a significant correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath0 for all blazars or for fsrqs , and there is weak correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath0 for bl lac objects .",
    "these experimental results support the theory that the optical - uv and x - ray emission is energizing the emission of the broad - line region , so the more optical - uv and x - rays emission in the core , the more broad - line region emission .",
    "it is true that in blazars the jet emission is highly beamed , so it is possible that much of the emission of the observed x - ray flux may be from the jet ( although even in the brightest objects , the x - ray flux densities are much weaker than the core ) .",
    "even if the jet synchrotron emission does dominate in the x - ray , to be called an fsrq the broad - line region emission must be commensurately bright enough to be seen over the synchrotron continuum , thereby introducing these correlations .",
    "this might explain why the correlations obtained in this paper are weaker for bl lac objects ( because bl lac objects have no blue bump ) .",
    "in addition , the radio flux depends almost exclusively on the parameters of a beamed jet , whereas the optical - uv and x - ray flux depends on both the unbeamed accretion disk and the beamed jet ; and the broad - line region flux depend on an unbeamed accretion disk .",
    "therefore , these results lead us to obtain that a strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 or between @xmath11 and @xmath0 , and a significant correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath0 , which based on the theoretical model of the formation of the jet .",
    "it is these correlations and difference of the correlations that imply a close link between accretion disks and jets ( i.e. jet - disk symbiosis ) .",

    "<S> there are very strong correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in both states for 39 fsrqs and the slopes of the linear regression equations are almost equal to 1 . </S>",
