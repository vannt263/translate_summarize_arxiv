    "furthermore , it is interesting to observe that the conjectured lower bound @xmath12 excludes too rapid thermalization : even if the fluid is initially perfectly equilibrated ( @xmath165 ) , a thermalization time well below @xmath166  fm / c is possible only if either @xmath167 or @xmath168 . with @xmath169 corrections to perfect fluidity at @xmath1 , shown by the long - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] , the minimal @xmath1 compatible with both @xmath5 and @xmath170 is about 1.2  fm / c . if @xmath171 , as deduced from the centrality dependence of elliptic flow at rhic  @xcite , then @xmath172  fm / c .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_7 ] we perform a similar analysis for our _ ansatz _  ( [ relaxads ] ) for the strong - coupling case . due to the much smaller relaxation time of the viscous stress",
    ", we observe that the viscosity bound is now rather insensitive to the magnitude of the initial correction to equilibrium .",
    "we obtain a lower bound on the thermalization time of @xmath173  fm / c for the minimal viscosity , increasing to about 1.2 - 2.2  fm / c if @xmath174 0.1 - 0.2 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] we return to the boltzmann gas with initial value for the stress as given in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) , corresponding to @xmath175 . comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig_6 ] , we observe that the viscosity bound is affected mostly for large @xmath1 : with this initial condition , a high viscosity @xmath176 is excluded even if the initial time is as big as 2  fm / c .",
    "the reason why the upper bound on the viscosity does not disappear at large @xmath1 for this initial stress is that @xmath177 grows with @xmath0 , cf.eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) . a lot of entropy would then be produced , even for large @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig_8 ] also gives an impression of the sensitivity to the entropy production bound .",
    "for @xmath178 , for example , @xmath1 decreases from @xmath179  fm / c , if the entropy is allowed to increase by 10% , to @xmath180  fm / c if the bound is relaxed to @xmath181 .",
    "we performed similar calculations for the strong - coupling limit as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] .",
    "the curves are rather close to those for a boltzmann gas from fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] , which is expected . with this initial condition ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath163 , the hydrodynamic evolution is close to the first - order theory for both cases .",
    "entropy production is sensitive only to @xmath1 and @xmath0 but is nearly independent of the stress relaxation time @xmath43 .",
    "[ fig_10 ] shows the ratio of the final to the initial entropy as a function of @xmath1 for two different values of @xmath0 , and the two different relaxation times discussed above in eqs .",
    "( [ relaxboltz ] , [ relaxads ] ) . here , @xmath182 has been fixed to the value appropriate for central au+au collisions while @xmath183 is varied accordingly .",
    "for example , for @xmath184  fm / c and @xmath185 , almost 30% entropy production occurs .",
    "this would account for the entire growth of @xmath144 from @xmath186 to @xmath187 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "that is , for these parameters the initial parton multiplicity per participant would have to be completely independent of centrality .",
    "for the same viscosity , @xmath188  fm / c would imply that nearly half of the final - state entropy was produced during the hydrodynamic stage , i.e.  that the initial multiplicity per participant should actually _ decrease _ with centrality .",
    "such a scenario appears unlikely to us . note that even for @xmath188  fm / c and @xmath12 , with @xmath189  mev one finds that @xmath190 is quite small .",
    "romatschke obtained similar numbers for the initial to final entropy ratio , albeit only for @xmath191  fm / c , in a computation that included cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed entropy production due to non - zero shear viscosity in central au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "we point out that a good knowledge of the _ initial conditions _ , and of the final state , of course , can provide useful constraints for hydrodynamics of high - energy collisions , specifically on transport coefficients , on the equation of state ( not discussed here , cf .",
    "@xcite ) , on the initial / thermalization time and so on .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "assuming that hydrodynamics applies at @xmath192 , then due to the rather restrictive bound on entropy production , it follows that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the qcd matter produced at central rapidity should be small , at most a few times the lower bound @xmath12 conjectured from the ads / cft correspondence at infinite coupling .",
    "this represents a consistency - check with similar numbers ( @xmath193 ) extracted from azimuthally asymmetric elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "we have neglected several other possible sources of entropy production , such as bulk viscosity near the transition region  @xcite or hadronic corona effects  @xcite ; such additional contributions might tighten the constraints even further .",
    "furthermore , the entropy production bound correlates the maximal allowed viscosity to the initial time @xmath1 for hydrodynamic evolution .",
    "this is due to the fact that the expansion rate is equal to the inverse of the expansion time , which makes entropy production from viscous effects rather sensitive to the value of @xmath1 .",
    "we have found that for @xmath194 , that the initial time for hydrodynamics should be around 1  fm / c , possibly a little larger .",
    "significantly smaller thermalization times would either require @xmath195 ( or even smaller than @xmath196 ) .",
    "alternatively , they would require a particle production mechanism that yields significantly lower initial multiplicities than the kln - cgc approach .",
    "given the very good description of the centrality dependence of the multiplicity , however , to us it appears reasonable to assume that this approach provides an adequate initial condition in that the initial parton multiplicity per participant increases with centrality .",
    "a significant problem with viscous hydrodynamics , in particular with the second - order approach of israel - stewart , is the fact that the number of initial parameters increases . even within the most simple framework followed here ( 1 + 1d bjorken expansion combined with neglect of conserved currents , of bulk viscosity , and of heat flow )",
    ", a unique solution requires us to specify , in addition to the ideal - fluid parameters , the shear viscosity and the initial value for the stress .",
    "the latter , in particular , is not a general property of near - equilibrium qcd but depends on the parton liberation and thermalization process .",
    "we have , however , introduced a physically motivated initial condition for the stress : if @xmath1 is defined as the earliest possible initial time for hydrodynamics , it is plausible that the initial reynolds number should be stationary , @xmath99 .",
    "otherwise the fluid either still departs from equilibrium ( @xmath197 ) ; or is already approaching it ( @xmath198 ) .    for small relaxation times of the stress , the condition that @xmath99 implies that its initial value already be close to that given by the first - order theory of eckart , landau and lifshitz ( the relativistic generalization of navier - stokes hydrodynamics ) .",
    "we therefore expect that in general the two approaches will provide rather similar results for heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one should keep in mind , however , that in the second - order theory the entropy current includes a term quadratic in the stress , which is of course absent from the first - order theory , and which reduces entropy production slightly .",
    "perhaps most importantly , with @xmath99 , the hydrodynamic evolution is largely independent of the stress relaxation time @xmath43 , and therefore similar for both a boltzmann gas at weak coupling ( with low viscosity , however ) and a strongly coupled plasma .",
    "the latter relaxes very rapidly to the first - order theory , regardless of the initial condition .",
    "the former , on the other hand , is forced by the initial condition to start close to relativistic navier - stokes , and the relaxation time is still sufficiently small to prevent a significant departure from the first - order theory .",
    "the initial condition @xmath99 also guarantees that @xmath199 for all @xmath116 , as long as the initial time is not extremely short ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "the effective enthalpy @xmath201 is therefore always positive . on the other hand ,",
    "our numerical results indicate that the reynolds number does not exceed @xmath202 during the qgp phase .",
    "this is well below the regime where navier - stokes turbulence occurs in incompressible , non - relativistic fluids ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "indeed , turbulence during the hydrodynamic stage would probably cause large fluctuations of the elliptic flow @xmath2  @xcite , which are not seen  @xcite .",
    "a quantitative interpretation of hydrodynamic flow effects in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc will of course require 2 + 1d and 3 + 1d solutions  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained here should prove useful for constraining the initial conditions ( in particular @xmath1 and @xmath85 ) for such large - scale numerical efforts .",
    "in particular , as we pointed out here , the entropy production bound correlates @xmath1 with @xmath0 . in turn",
    ", we expect that elliptic flow will provide an _ anti - correlation _ since later times and larger shear viscosity should both reduce its magnitude . the intersection of those curves could then provide an estimate of the initial time for hydrodynamics at rhic .",
