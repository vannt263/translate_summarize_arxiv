    "evidence continues to accumulate that the outermost milky way globular clusters may not have originated in the same process that formed the inner globular clusters . based on the recognition that the second parameter effect of horizontal branch morphology in globular clusters is found predominantly among outer halo ( @xmath6 kpc ) clusters",
    ", @xcite proposed that the outermost globular clusters may have formed in chemically distinct `` fragments '' that later fell into the milky way halo .",
    "building on the suggestion by @xcite that several red horizontal branch ( second parameter ) globular clusters were potentially associated with the magellanic plane group of dwarf galaxies , @xcite showed that there is a planar alignment between a particular sample of second parameter globular clusters and the milky way dwarfs .",
    "recently , @xcite reaffirmed that there may be a dynamical relationship between the second parameter globular clusters and the milky way dwarf satellites .    the pyxis globular cluster ( @xcite ; @xcite ) at @xmath7 kpc ( sarajedini & geisler 1996 ) defines the inner edge of the prominent gap in the globular cluster radial distribution between @xmath8 kpc .",
    "the presence of this gap has been used to argue that the primordial galactic globular cluster system ends at @xmath140 kpc while the distant , @xmath9 kpc clusters originated in galactic satellite dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . although pyxis lies among the `` inner group '' of globular clusters ( i.e. , inside the gap in @xmath10 ) , irwin et al .  ( 1995 ) propose that pyxis may be a captured lmc globular cluster based on the young age they infer for the globular cluster and on its proximity to the plane of the lmc orbit derived from the @xcite proper motion .",
    "further support for the tidal capture hypothesis comes from @xcite , where a statistical analysis of the likely orbital poles of the galactic satellite galaxies and the globular clusters identifies pyxis , ngc 6229 , ngc 7006 , and pal 4 as the globular clusters most likely to share a common orbital pole with either the magellanic plane galaxies ( the lmc , the smc , draco , and ursa minor ) or the fornax  leo  sculptor stream galaxies .",
    "however , these postulations on the origin of pyxis have been made without the benefit of any kinematical data on the cluster .",
    "although deep photometry of pyxis exists ( sarajedini & geisler 1996 ) , no spectroscopic observations have been published .",
    "indeed , pyxis is one of the last few known globular clusters lacking a radial velocity ( cf .",
    "harris 1996 ) .",
    "we report here on du  pont 2.5-m telescope spectroscopic observations of pyxis stars (  2 ) . with our derived radial velocity for the cluster",
    ", we re - address the stripped lmc hypothesis for pyxis origin (  3 ) , but point out that , in the end , we can only make predictions on the proper motions expected under this scenario .",
    "unfortunately , the proper motion is required for a definitive solution to the question of the cluster s origin .",
    "on the nights of 17 january and 20 january 1997 , the 2.5-m du pont telescope at the las campanas observatory was used to obtain spectra of pyxis giant stars with magnitudes of @xmath11 . a finding chart for these stars made from the digitized sky survey ( @xcite )",
    "is presented as figure 1 .",
    "observations of the pyxis stars made use of the modular spectrograph and the site2 detector with a 1200 lines / mm grating .",
    "the selected wavelength region with this setup was approximately 7700  8750   at @xmath11.3   per pixel resolution .",
    "typical exposure times were 900 seconds per observation , which provided enough signal - to - noise to measure radial velocities .",
    "radial velocities were measured for six pyxis giant stars by cross - correlating their spectra against those of bright radial velocity standard stars .",
    "the cross - correlation peak yielded the adopted radial velocity difference between the pyxis stars and the standard .",
    "the star hd80170 , a k5 giant , was observed multiple times on both nights to serve as the main standard .",
    "two other hd stars and 11 lmc globular cluster stars were also observed as radial velocity calibration objects .",
    "all standards with known radial velocities were used to remove any nightly zero point offsets in the radial velocities determined by cross - correlating against the hd80170 template .",
    "the pyxis stars were observed multiple times , and the radial velocity for each star was determined by taking the median of the values for a particular star . in table 1 we present the positions , magnitudes , and velocities of the stars observed .",
    "we find a mean radial velocity for the six stars of @xmath12 km / sec with @xmath13 km / sec . if we ignore the one outlier , pyxis d , the mean radial velocity for the five remaining stars increases slightly , to @xmath14 km / sec with @xmath15 km / sec .",
    "the wavelength range of our spectra includes the triplet lines at @xmath16 8498 , 8542 , and 8662  .",
    "@xcite measured equivalent widths for a large sample of globular cluster stars and in a companion paper ( rutledge et al .",
    "1997b ) derived a conversion from reduced equivalent width , @xmath17 , to metallicity . to determine a spectroscopic metallicity for pyxis",
    ", we attempted to measure the strengths of these lines in our spectra .",
    "of the six pyxis stars observed , only the brightest , pyxis a , produced equivalent width measurements with errors small enough to give a reliable estimate of the metallicity .",
    "the technique used to determine the equivalent widths for the pyxis a lines was nearly identical to that used in @xcite .    for each observation of pyxis",
    "a , the continuum was determined by linearly interpolating the average intensity in the @xcite continuum bandpasses .",
    "the equivalent width was then calculated by integrating the difference between the fit continuum and the line feature over the line bandpass .",
    "the line feature was fit with a gaussian function , and the integral was performed using the fit rather than numerically integrating the data since @xcite concluded that this technique is preferable to direct numerical integration .",
    "the three individual lines were combined into a single index , @xmath18ca , following the method of @xcite , where @xmath18ca @xmath19 . for pyxis",
    "a , the result is @xmath18ca @xmath20  .",
    "the @xcite method for converting @xmath18ca to metallicity requires the reduction of the equivalent width to the value for giants at the level of the horizontal branch , @xmath17 , so that a mean value for all cluster stars can be obtained .",
    "this is done by adopting a slope @xmath21 and extrapolating the calculated width to the expected value at the magnitude of the horizontal branch , @xmath22 .",
    "all of the published photometry for pyxis stars has used the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands , so we have had to approximate @xmath25 using color - color relations for giant stars . adopting the photometry from @xcite",
    ", we find that pyxis a has @xmath26 and that the horizontal branch of pyxis is at @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite find an almost linear relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath29 for giant stars , so we have determined rough @xmath30 magnitudes for pyxis a and the pyxis horizontal branch stars by estimating a @xmath29 color from the @xmath31 color given in @xcite .",
    "we estimate that for pyxis , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , or @xmath34 . in the table of globular cluster properties by @xcite ,",
    "the magnitude of the horizontal branch is also given as @xmath32 , so the adopted @xmath29 colors are most likely a good approximation to the true colors .    the reduced equivalent width of pyxis a is therefore @xmath35 if we follow @xcite and adopt a slope of @xmath36  / magnitude .",
    "this value is simply an estimate , since there is a dispersion of 0.2   in the values of @xmath18ca from the four individual observations and since there is some uncertainty in @xmath25 , probably of order 0.1 magnitudes .",
    "however , we can use this determination to get an estimate of the metallicity of pyxis a for comparison with the photometrically determined metallicity estimates of irwin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and @xcite . using the @xcite calibration of @xmath17 to zinn - west metallicity ,",
    "the reduced equivalent width measured for pyxis a implies a metallicity of @xmath4fe / h@xmath5_{zw } = -1.4 \\pm 0.1 $ ] .",
    "this value for pyxis a is more metal - poor than the photometrically derived values of @xcite and irwin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who estimate @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , however it is consistent within the overlap of the @xmath39 error bars .",
    "any systematic error that leads to an underestimated equivalent width for pyxis a results in a smaller determined metallicity .",
    "an error of 10% in the equivalent width measured for pyxis a is enough to bring the metallicity up to @xmath40 and into better agreement with the photometric values .",
    "if the equivalent width measurement is correct , then it is unlikely that the metallicity is much higher than @xmath4fe / h@xmath5_{zw } = -1.4 $ ] , since an unlikely error in the @xmath30 magnitude of pyxis a of 0.7 magnitudes is required to raise the metallicity of the star to @xmath40 .",
    "the observations presented here were partially motivated by the possibility that the pyxis globular cluster was captured from the lmc by the milky way .",
    "this assertion was originally made by irwin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who noted that pyxis , at @xmath41 , lies within a few degrees of the orbital plane of the lmc determined from the @xcite proper motion .",
    "further support for this hypothesis is provided by @xcite , who place pyxis in a group with pal 4 , ngc 6229 , and ngc 7006 as the most likely globular clusters to share a common orbital pole with the magellanic plane galaxies ( the lmc , the smc , ursa minor , and draco ) .",
    "although full space motion information is required to verify the irwin et al .",
    "( 1995 ) hypothesis , a radial velocity can provide some constraints on the shapes of allowed orbits for a cluster if the magnitude of the radial component is a significant fraction of the expected magnitude of the space velocity .    the essence of the argument given in palma et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to support a capture origin for the pyxis globular cluster is as follows : if it is assumed that pyxis was captured recently from the lmc by the milky way , then the orbital pole of pyxis is likely to be aligned with that of the lmc ( both the lmc and pyxis are far enough from the galactic center that precession will not significantly affect the positions of their orbital poles over a hubble time ) .",
    "if one assumes rotation about the galactic center , the direction of the orbital pole of the lmc can be determined by taking the cross product of the galactocentric radius vector to the lmc and its space motion vector .",
    "if one accounts for the space velocity vector error , the position of the orbital pole of the lmc can only be confined to a _",
    "family _ of poles along an arc segment in galactocentric coordinates ( cf .",
    "figure 1 in palma et al .",
    "2000 ) . since the space motion of pyxis is currently unknown , its orbital pole is not well constrained .",
    "however , the orbital pole can be assumed to be perpendicular to its current galactocentric position , so the direction of pyxis orbital pole should lie on the great circle that contains all possible normals to its current radius vector ( cf .",
    "figure 2 shows an aitoff projection of the sky in galactocentric coordinates . the arc segment that defines the possible locations of the lmc s orbital pole ( based on the jones et al .  [",
    "1994 ] proper motion , as adopted by palma et al .",
    "[ 2000 ] ) is shown as well as the great circle along which lies all possible orbital poles of pyxis . that these two families of possible orbital poles for the lmc and for pyxis intersect ( at galactocentric @xmath42 ) indicates that it is possible for these two objects to share a coplanar orbit with a common direction of angular momentum .",
    "it now remains to be seen whether our derived radial velocity can clarify whether this is likely , i.e. , is the orbital pole of pyxis likely to be near the crossing point of the two orbital pole families ?",
    "we start our analysis by adopting a simple strawman model wherein pyxis is following a circular orbit that is nearly coplanar with the orbit of the lmc .",
    "simulations of tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies by the milky way ( johnston 1998 ) show that the debris is distributed around the orbit of the parent satellite with a spread in energy given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the tidal radius of the satellite , @xmath45 is the parent galaxy gravitational potential , @xmath46 is the circular velocity of the galactic halo , @xmath47 is the satellite s mass , @xmath48 is the mass of the parent galaxy enclosed within the satellite s orbit , and the last equality defines the _ tidal scale _ @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the spread in energy translates into a characteristic angular width @xmath49 ( in radians ) to the debris . taking reasonable values for the mass of the lmc and the milky way",
    ", the value of @xmath49 for any debris pulled from the lmc corresponds to roughly @xmath3 . in figure 2 ,",
    "an arc segment along the great circle of possible orbital poles for pyxis is marked ; this arc segment is defined by a length within @xmath50 degrees of the intersection point with the possible orbital pole of the lmc , and indicates expectations for the orbital poles of lmc debris at the position of pyxis on the sky .",
    "it is straightforward to derive the direction of the space motion vector required for pyxis to follow a circular orbit and have an orbital pole along the arc segment in figure 2 , i.e.  in the direction of @xmath51 , or @xmath52 .",
    "the geometry is illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "the galactocentric , cartesian radius vector of pyxis is @xmath53 kpc ( assuming that the distance from the sun to the galactic center , @xmath54 kpc , and where @xmath55 kpc ) .",
    "the unit vector @xmath51 from the galactic center in the direction of the orbital pole at galactocentric @xmath52 is @xmath56 . in figure 3 , this vector has been translated to the location of pyxis .",
    "the vector that is mutually perpendicular to the galactocentric radius vector of pyxis and to the orbital pole @xmath51 gives the direction of the space motion of the pyxis globular cluster for a circular orbit around the galactic center .",
    "the unit vector direction of this space motion is @xmath57 .",
    "since our line of sight to pyxis is mostly in the @xmath58 direction and since @xmath59 is mostly in the @xmath60 direction , clearly any component of @xmath59 along our line of sight will be small .",
    "adopting the basic solar motion of @xmath61 km / sec ( @xcite ) and a rotational velocity of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) of 220 km / sec , then the component of the sun s velocity along the line of sight from the sun to pyxis is @xmath62 km / sec ( the negative sign here indicates that the component of the sun s velocity with respect to the galactic standard of rest along the line of sight to pyxis is in the sense of receding from pyxis ; see the appendix for a discussion of the sign conventions used in reducing the radial velocity to a @xmath63 ) .",
    "since the heliocentric radial velocity measured for pyxis is the difference between the intrinsic radial velocity of pyxis with respect to the position of the sun , @xmath63 , and the magnitude of the sun s velocity projected along the line of sight to pyxis ( @xmath64 ) , the globular cluster would have a large , positive heliocentric radial velocity if it were following a circular orbit in the plane defined by the pole at @xmath51 .",
    "it is the solar motion that dominates the radial velocity in the circular orbit case .",
    "for example , if we assume that pyxis has a velocity that is approximately the circular velocity of the galaxy at 40 kpc , or @xmath1200 km / sec , its space motion would then be @xmath65 km / sec .",
    "since the galactic cartesian unit vector in the direction of pyxis from the sun ( the line of sight ) is @xmath66 , the component of this space velocity along the line of sight would be @xmath67 or @xmath68 km / sec",
    "( the direction and magnitude of this component of the @xmath63 in the circular orbit case is shown as @xmath69 in figure 3 , while the direction and magnitude of the _ measured _",
    "@xmath63 for pyxis is shown as @xmath70 ) . including the component of the sun s velocity along the line of sight ( @xmath71 km / sec )",
    ", the heliocentric radial velocity ( @xmath72 in figure 3 ) for pyxis in this case would be @xmath73 km / sec .",
    "since this is much larger than the measured value ( 36 km / sec , @xmath74 in figure 3 ) , we conclude that pyxis is not in an orbit that gives rise to a present space velocity near @xmath59 and , therefore , the strawman model of pyxis being on a _ circular _ orbit and sharing the lmc orbital pole grossly fails expectations .",
    "thus , one or both of the assumptions in the strawman model must be invalid : either pyxis is not on a circular orbit or / and pyxis orbit does not share a pole with the lmc .",
    "since the inferred radial velocity of the pyxis globular cluster with respect to a stationary observer at the location of the sun has a large magnitude , @xmath75 km / sec , constraints can be placed on non - circular orbits pyxis may follow that also share the plane and direction of rotation of the lmc s orbit .",
    "we have calculated the orbital pole for the pyxis globular cluster given all possible , realistic proper motions and accounting for our derived radial velocity . in figure 4 , we present the region in proper motion space that produces an orbital pole for the pyxis globular cluster that is within @xmath3 of the pole of the lmc s orbit .",
    "we limit the possible proper motions to those that yield a space velocity less than the escape velocity from the milky way at the position of pyxis ( @xmath1415 km / sec in the galactic model of kochanek [ 1996 ] ) and obtain the shaded region in figure 4 .",
    "this is a prediction for the magnitude and direction of the proper motion of pyxis with respect to the sun assuming that the milky way capture from the magellanic clouds hypothesis is correct .",
    "the proper motions in the shaded region of figure 4 are those that can produce an orbital pole in the direction of @xmath51 given a @xmath63 of @xmath76 km / sec for pyxis .",
    "we have calculated the shapes and energies of the orbits allowed for pyxis to determine if a pole in the direction of @xmath51 is only likely for a very restricted range of conditions .",
    "for example , is the lmc capture origin for pyxis only viable if pyxis is following an extremely eccentric orbit ?",
    "in fact , a range of orbits is possible for pyxis given a proper motion in the shaded region in figure 4 .",
    "for a given elliptical orbit , the angle between the instantaneous velocity and radius vectors varies with position along the ellipse and that angle has a well defined minimum value for a given orbital eccentricity . for each space motion derived from our radial velocity and a proper motion from figure 4 ,",
    "we have determined the angle between the velocity vector and the present galactocentric radius vector for pyxis . assuming a closed , elliptical orbit",
    ", we can determine the lower limit for the eccentricity of the associated orbit having the given angle between the velocity and radius vectors at the present position of pyxis .",
    "the orbits determined for pyxis given our radial velocity and a proper motion in the shaded region in figure 4 have eccentricities of @xmath77 , with the peak of the distribution of all allowable eccentricities near @xmath780.8 .",
    "we note here that few of the globular clusters with measured proper motions are following nearly circular orbits .",
    "@xcite has compiled all of the measured proper motions for a sample of 38 galactic globular clusters and integrated orbits for each cluster .",
    "figure 5 presents a histogram of the orbital eccentricities that @xcite calculated for the globular clusters in their sample .",
    "the open histogram in figure 5 represents the data on the whole sample , while the hatched histogram represents the data on the 10 clusters with apogalactica greater than 20 kpc .",
    "less than half of the entire sample have eccentricities of @xmath79 , and , more importantly , for the outer halo globular clusters the measured eccentricities are mostly found in the range @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , one might conclude that it is more likely than not that pyxis is following an eccentric orbit and its space motion is _ not _ perpendicular to its current position .",
    "however , such a conclusion must be tempered with the acknowledgement of a potential selection bias for the latter subsample .",
    "the majority of the globular clusters with measured proper motions are those that are currently close to the sun .",
    "therefore , the clusters with large apogalactica that have measured proper motions are , for the most part , currently near perigalacticon and thus must be following eccentric orbits .",
    "thus , the sample of globular clusters that make up the hatched histogram in figure 5 may be selected preferentially from the sample of outer halo globular clusters on eccentric orbits . since few outer halo globular clusters near apogalacticon",
    "have measured proper motions , the true distribution of eccentricities for outer halo globular clusters is unknown .",
    "however , the fact remains that a non - negligible ( and perhaps dominant ) fraction of the outer halo globular cluster population is orbiting the galaxy with eccentricities near 0.8 , and since the majority of the outer halo globular clusters with orbits integrated by @xcite have eccentricities near @xmath780.8 , it is at least conceivable that the orbit of pyxis has a similar eccentricity .",
    "for our measured pyxis radial velocity , we have integrated orbits for a grid of @xmath81 proper motions found in the shaded region in figure 4 in the potential of @xcite for 10 gyr each .",
    "the orbital energy of pyxis determined from the majority of the proper motions that produce an orbital pole at @xmath51 is within the @xmath82 error bars of the orbital energy of the lmc , although the error bar is large ( @xmath83 km@xmath84/sec@xmath84 ) .",
    "however , johnston ( 1998 ) found that in simulations of tidal stripping , debris was found within @xmath85 of the parent object ( see eq .",
    "1 ) . _ all _ of the orbits produced from our measured radial velocity and a proper motion in the shaded region of figure 4 are within @xmath85 of the orbital energy of the lmc .",
    "since the @xmath51 orbits do not require extremely unlikely constraints on the eccentricity and since the orbital energies for these orbits are similar to expectations for debris from the lmc , the lmc capture origin for pyxis remains viable .",
    "it has been proposed since its discovery that the pyxis globular cluster may have been captured by the milky way from the magellanic clouds .",
    "if the space motion for pyxis were known , a comparison of the position of its orbital pole with respect to the lmc as well as a comparison of its angular momentum and orbital energy to that of the lmc would allow one to determine if the two objects share similar orbits .",
    "although only one component of the space motion of pyxis is now measured , some constraints can be placed on its possible orbit in the tidal capture scenario . a circular orbit with an orbital pole at @xmath86",
    "is completely ruled out by the measured radial velocity .",
    "however , we have shown here that the large radial velocity of pyxis with respect to a stationary observer at the position of the sun does not rule out the possibility that the cluster was captured from the lmc since a reasonable range of viable orbits with @xmath870.8 exist for pyxis that are also similar in energy and angular momentum to that of the lmc .",
    "no suitable first epoch plate material is known to exist for pyxis , so an attempt to measure its proper motion to better determine the likelihood that pyxis may be a captured lmc globular cluster will require precise observations with the hst or the space interferometry mission ( sim ) .",
    "although proper motions are not available for the majority of the outer halo globular clusters , their spatial distribution has been used to argue that they are likely to have been accreted into the halo ( e.g. , majewski 1994 , palma et al .",
    "recently , dinescu et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have measured a proper motion for the young globular cluster pal 12 and they find that its orbit is what one would expect if it had been captured from the _ sagittarius _ dwarf galaxy .",
    "an accretion origin of the outer halo , second parameter horizontal branch globular clusters is often invoked to explain the possible younger age of some of these objects ( where youth is inferred either from the second parameter effect itself or from relative age estimates determined from the cluster cmds ) .",
    "the physical mechanism that causes the second parameter effect in globular clusters is still unknown : although it is now generally agreed that there are indeed some globular clusters with anomalously young ages , age differences alone may not be enough to explain the second parameter effect . whether or not the physical mechanism that causes the effect is age , the possibility that conditions somehow favor the formation of second parameter globular clusters preferentially in milky way satellite galaxies ( which later get accreted by the galaxy ) may explain the source of the differences between second parameter and non - second parameter globular clusters .",
    "the age measurement for the pyxis globular cluster by @xcite , @xmath88 gyr , suggests that it is younger by @xmath13 gyr than the oldest milky way globular clusters when measured on the same age scale .",
    "recently , age measurements for the oldest lmc globular clusters have been made ( @xcite ) using a different technique than that used for pyxis , but their average age of @xmath89 gyr places them similar in age to the oldest milky way globular clusters , when calibrated onto the same absolute age scale .",
    "another study of a different sample of lmc clusters ( @xcite ) also finds the oldest lmc clusters to be as old as the old milky way clusters .",
    "thus , we may conclude that typical lmc clusters are older than pyxis .",
    "however , at least one of the clusters in the olsen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sample is @xmath12 gyr younger than the others ( ngc 1898 ) , which makes it similar in age to pyxis .",
    "therefore , it is not impossible to place pyxis in the `` lmc family '' of clusters from age arguments , though it does appear that pyxis would be at the young end of the age range for old lmc clusters .    it may be noted , however , that the current orbital pole of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is also very near the intersection point of the poles of the lmc and pyxis ( see figure 2 ) . since the smc is more fragile due to its weaker gravitational potential , perhaps a more attractive origin for pyxis is from stripping of the smc rather than the lmc .",
    "recent studies of smc globular clusters have found that the smc clusters show a range in ages ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) including at least one cluster with an age similar to pyxis ( ngc 121 ) .",
    "the orbital energy of the smc has a larger magnitude and a smaller error bar than that of the lmc , so not all of the orbits produced from a proper motion in the shaded region in figure 4 have orbital energies similar to expectations of smc debris .",
    "only the orbits having proper motions found in the inner part of the shaded region , with a total magnitude of the proper motion of @xmath10.75 mas / yr , have orbital energies consistent with an smc capture origin . since the same orbital energy and age arguments applied to support the lmc capture origin also apply to the smc , we consider it a possibility that pyxis may have been captured from either the lmc or the smc .",

    "the conversion of velocities among various reference frames is treated in the literature and in the standard texts , such as mihalas & binney ( 1981 ) .",
    "because we have found some confusing misuse of the standard terminology in the literature , we provide this detailed explanation of our sign and naming conventions .    the radial velocity that one measures for a star is the velocity of that object with respect to the earth .",
    "often , corrections are made to this velocity to remove the motions of the earth and sun , which reduces the measured radial velocity to a velocity with respect to some standard of rest .",
    "for example , the measured heliocentric radial velocity ( @xmath91 ) is reduced to the radial velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( @xmath92 ) by removing the sun s peculiar velocity with respect to the lsr :          referring to this velocity as `` @xmath63 '' or a `` galactocentric '' velocity apparently causes some confusion in the interpretation of velocity data . when reduced using the above two equations , the velocity referred to as @xmath63 is the velocity of the object as seen by a stationary observer at the position of the sun .",
    "the direction of this velocity is along the line of sight between the object and the sun and not along the line of sight between the object and the galactic center .",
    "the latter misinterpretation of `` galactocentric '' velocity ( as we have found in some articles in the literature ) can lead to misleading or erroneous conclusions .",
    "there is an additional ambiguity in the definition of @xmath63 , and that is the sign convention . for a typical radial velocity , positive refers to a velocity that is moving away from the origin , and negative refers to a velocity that is approaching the origin .",
    "the origin for the `` galactocentric '' radial velocity , or @xmath63 , is the sun and not the galactic center .",
    "therefore , the sign convention for @xmath63 is that a positive velocity indicates that the object is moving away from a stationary observer at the position of the sun and a negative velocity indicates that the object is moving towards a stationary observer at the position of the sun .",
    "the right hand sides of the two equations above are collectively the velocity of the sun along the line of sight .",
    "this sign convention introduces additional confusion because the sign may not agree with the sign convention for the cartesian galactocentric @xmath95 system , and because the sign of the contribution of the sun s motion , @xmath96 can seem counterintuitive .    for example",
    ", the pyxis globular cluster has been measured to have a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath136 km / sec . using the above equations , @xmath97 km / sec for pyxis .",
