    "double perovskites with a general formula a@xmath2bb@xmath3o@xmath4 where b and b@xmath3 are transition metal ions and a is a rare - earth or alkaline - earth ion , are materials that have attracted enormous amount of attention in recent time due to the diversity of their applications as for example in the field of spintronics ( sr@xmath0femoo@xmath1@xcite ) , multiferroicity ( ba@xmath2nimno@xmath4@xcite ) , magnetodielectric materials ( la@xmath2nimno@xmath4@xcite@xmath5@xcite ) , magneto - optic devices ( sr@xmath2croso@xmath4 , sr@xmath2crreo@xmath1@xcite ) .",
    "the choice of b and b@xmath3 ions , provide the tunability of b - o - b@xmath3 interaction , giving rise to a variety of magnetic properties like ferromagnetism , antiferromagnetism , ferrimagnetism and electronic properties like metallic , half - metallic and insulating  @xcite .",
    "the presence of two transition metal ions instead of one as in perovskite material is expected to give rise to far more tunability and richness of properties compared to simple perovskites .",
    "perhaps the most studied member of this series that arose much interest is sr@xmath2femoo@xmath4 ( sfmo ) .",
    "this material was reported @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath6@xciteto exhibit a large magnetoresistance(mr ) effect with a fairly high ferromagnetic transition temperature of about 410 k , opening up the possibility of designing spintronics materials operating at room temperature . however , unlike colossal magnetoresistive compounds as manganites , this mr does not arise from electron - phonon interactions .",
    "rather , it is extrinsic , of tunnelling magnetoresistive ( tmr ) origin . since the report of the large mr effect and high magnetic transition temperature ,",
    "a number of experimental studies like nmr@xcite , xes@xcite , hall measurements@xcite , magnetic measurements@xcite have been carried out to characterize various properties of this material .",
    "there have been also a number of theoretical studies involving both first - principles calculations @xcite@xmath6@xcite as well as model calculations @xcite@xmath6@xcite .",
    "the unusually high ferromagnetic transition temperature in sr@xmath2femoo@xmath4 and related material like sr@xmath2fereo@xmath4 was rationalized @xcite@xmath5@xcite in terms of a kinetic energy driven mechanism which produces a negative spin polarization at otherwise nonmagnetic site like mo or re .",
    "following this idea , a double - exchange like two sublattice model was introduced and studied by different groups@xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath5@xcite . while most of the studies @xcite@xmath5@xcite@xmath5@xcite were restricted only to ferromagnetic phase , some of the studies @xcite@xmath5@xcite were extended to other competing magnetic phases too .",
    "very recently @xcite , the problem has been studied in detail in terms of a full numerical solution of spin - fermion model and as well as in terms of reduced , classical magnetic model .",
    "these studies predict that when the competing magnetic phases are taken into account , the electron doped model systems beyond a certain doping prefers to have antiferromagnetic(afm ) arrangement of fe spins compared to ferromagnetic(fm ) arrangement of the undoped system .",
    "_ the predicted antiferromagnetic phase in electron - doped system is kinetic - energy driven rather than super - exchange driven , as is the case for example in sr@xmath2fewo@xmath4@xcite , which is an insulating antiferromagnet with nel temperature of @xmath7 20 k. _ the superexchange driven antiferromagnetic phase is necessarily insulating while the kinetic energy driven afm phase may not be so .",
    "the prediction of such an antiferromagnetic phase of different origin is therefore of significance .",
    "while the kinetic energy driven antiferromagnetic phases have been suggested in hole - doped rare - earth manganites ( eg.the ce phase at half - doping  @xcite ) , to the best of our knowledge , till date no reports of such analogous phases in double perovskites exist , thereby , opening up the possibility of experimental exploration in this front .",
    "however the afore - mentioned model calculations were carried out in two dimension and with single band , which was justified by the assumption that the dominant nearest - neighbor b - b@xmath3 interactions are operative between orbitals of same symmetry and within a given plane .",
    "these restrictions are not strictly true .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic ordering in real material is three - dimensional . a full three - dimensional , all orbital calculation without these approximations , is therefore necessary to put the possible existence of the afm phase in firm footing .",
    "considering the above mentioned points , it is therefore , of interest to study the problem of electron doping using first - principles , density functional theory ( dft ) based calculations .",
    "the first principles calculations which take into account all the structural and chemical aspects correctly is expected to provide more realistic scenario and verification of predictions made by model calculations .",
    "the sr ions in sfmo can be substituted for trivalent cations , like la , leading to sr@xmath8la@xmath9femoo@xmath4 .",
    "this would cause electron doping in the system , with @xmath10 electron per formula unit in the conduction band , compared to 1 electron per formula unit in the undoped sfmo situation . to our knowledge",
    ", there exists very few first - principles study of the la - doped sfmo system .",
    "few studies @xcite@xmath5@xcite that exist explored only the ferromagnetic phase , did not consider the other competing magnetic phases and were restricted mostly to sr - rich part of the phase diagram .",
    "motivated by the findings of the model calculations @xcite , we considered it worthwhile to span the whole concentration range from @xmath11 _ ie _ sr@xmath2femoo@xmath4 to @xmath12 _ ie _ la@xmath2femoo@xmath4 and study the relative stability of the various magnetic phases as one increases the carrier concentration through the increased doping of la .",
    "we have carried out our study both in terms of full ab - initio calculations as well as in terms of solutions of multi - orbital , low - energy hamiltonians defined in a first - principles derived wannier function basis .",
    "the structural optimization and total energy calculations of various magnetic phases have been carried out using the plane wave pseudopotential method as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite , while the doping effect in first - principles calculations has been simulated through supercell technique .",
    "the construction of low - energy hamiltonian in first - principles derived wannier function basis has been achieved through muffin - tin orbital ( mto ) based nth order mto ( nmto)-downfolding technique @xcite .",
    "the constructed multi - orbital , spin - fermion hamiltonian defined in the first - principles derived wannier function basis has been solved by means of real space based exact diagonalization technique .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized in the following manner .",
    "section ii contains the details of the employed methods and calculations .",
    "section iii is devoted to results which consist of three subsections : ( a ) total energy calculations , electronic structure and relative stability of various magnetic phases in doped compounds ( b ) determination of low - energy , few orbital hamiltonian by nmto - downfolding ( c ) calculations of magnetic phase diagram and magnetic transition temperatures in terms of low - energy hamiltonian .",
    "the paper concludes with section iv containing discussion and summary .",
    "the first - principles dft calculations were carried out using the plane wave pseudopotential method implemented within vasp .",
    "we considered exchange - correlation functionals within generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite and gga+u @xcite .",
    "we used projector augmented wave ( paw ) potentials @xcite and the wavefunctions were expanded in the plane wave basis with a kinetic energy cut - off of 450 ev .",
    "reciprocal space integration was carried out with a k - space mesh of 6 @xmath13 6 @xmath136 .",
    "two sets of supercell calculations were carried out , one with two formula unit and another with eight formula unit .",
    "the two formula unit supercells with two inequivalent fe atoms can accommodate the ferromagnetic spin alignment of fe spins and the a type antiferromagnetic spin alignments of fe spins .",
    "the eight formula unit supercells with eight inequivalent fe atoms in the unit cell , in addition to fm and a type afm , can accommodate g type antiferromagnetic ordering of fe spins ( see fig.1 )     the fe sublattice ordering of sr@xmath8la@xmath9femoo@xmath4 . shown are the a - type(left panel ) and g - type ( right panel ) antiferromagnetic arrangement of fe spins . in case of a - type",
    "antiferromagnetism the fe spins in - plane are ferromagnetically coupled , while fe spins between two adjacent plans are antiferromagnetically coupled . for g - type antiferromagnetism ,",
    "the fe spins are antiferromagnetically coupled both out - of - plane and in - plane .",
    "the shaded box indicate the unit cell of two formula unit supercell.,width=340 ]    for extraction of a few - band , tight - binding hamiltonian out of full dft calculation which can be used as input to multi - orbital , low - energy hamiltonian based calculations , we have carried out nmto - downfolding calculations . starting from a full dft calculations ,",
    "nmto - downfolding arrives at a few - orbital hamiltonian by integrating out degrees which are not of interest .",
    "it does so by defining energy - selected , effective orbitals which serve as wannier - like orbitals defining the few - orbital hamiltonian in the _ downfolded _ representation .",
    "nmto technique which is not yet available in its self - consistent form relies on the self - consistent potential parameters obtained out of linear muffin - tine orbital ( lmto)@xcite calculations .",
    "the results were cross - checked among the plane wave and lmto calculations in terms of total energy differences , density of states and band structures .",
    "the multi - orbital , low - energy hamiltonian that is assumed to capture the essential physics of sfmo , should consist of the following ingredients : ( i )  a large core spin at the fe site , ( ii )  strong coupling on the fe site between the core spin and the itinerant electron , strongly preferring _",
    "one _ spin polarization of the itinerant electron , and ( iii )  delocalization of the itinerant electron on the fe - mo network .    from the above considerations ,",
    "the representative hamiltonian is given by : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16    the @xmath17 s refer to the fe sites and the @xmath18 s to the mo sites .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 represent the nearest neighbor fe - mo , second nearest neighbor mo - mo and fe - fe hoppings respectively , the largest hopping being given by @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath22 is the spin index and @xmath23 is the orbital index that spans the t@xmath24 manifold .",
    "the difference between the t@xmath24 levels of fe and mo , @xmath25 , defines the charge transfer energy . since among the crystal - field split",
    "d levels of fe and mo , only the relevant @xmath26 orbitals are retained , the on - site and hopping matrices are of dimension 3 @xmath13 3 .",
    "the @xmath27 are ` classical ' ( large @xmath28 ) core spins at the b site , coupled to the itinerant b electrons through a coupling @xmath29 .    given the fact that @xmath29 , the hamiltonian of eqn  [ fullhamsfmo ] can be cast into form appropriate for @xmath30 .",
    "this gives the following hamiltonian , with ` spinless ' fe conduction electrons and mo electrons having both spin states .",
    "@xmath31    this is the lowest energy hamiltonian .",
    "there is no longer any ` large ' coupling in the hamiltonian , and the number of degrees of freedom has been reduced to three per fe site and six per mo , compared to original problem with six degrees of freedom at both fe and mo sites . @xmath32 and @xmath33 hop to different conduction electron projections at the neighboring fe sites so the effective hopping picks up a @xmath34 dependent modulation .",
    "for example , @xmath35 , corresponds to fm configuration with all fe core spins being up .",
    "since the spin @xmath28 is large and can be considered classical , one can consider different spin configurations ( ferro , antiferro and disordered ) and diagonalize the system in real space , to obtain variational estimates of the ground state , and its stability .",
    "sr@xmath2femoo@xmath4 crystallizes in body centered tetragonal space group with i4/mmm symmetry .",
    "the crystal structure of sfmo is well characterized .",
    "the crystal structure of la - doped sr@xmath2femoo@xmath4 on the other hand is controversial .",
    "some of the study @xcite reports that though i4/mmm symmetry is retained for small doping of la , for doping beyond @xmath36 or so , the symmetry changes to p2@xmath37/n .",
    "the other measurements @xcite however reports that all compounds of sr@xmath8la@xmath38femoo@xmath4 for @xmath39 0 , 0.25 , 0.5 and 1.0 crystallize in i4/mmm symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , the information of the detail crystal structure data are limited due to the facts that a ) the compounds till now have been synthesized only for la concentrations less than or equal to 1 b ) increasing concentration of la leads to increased disorder which prohibits accurate measurement of the underlying symmetry . while in the following",
    ", we have primarily reported the results assuming i4/mmm symmetry , we have also carried out calculation for p2@xmath37/n symmetry for the end member , la@xmath2femoo@xmath4 ( lfmo ) .",
    "the crystal structure corresponding to p2@xmath37/n symmetry for la@xmath2femoo@xmath4 was obtained starting with initial parameters of @xmath39 0.4 as reported in ref.@xcite and then performing total energy optimization of the initial structure .",
    "the p2@xmath37/n symmetry structure has been found to be energetically lower in energy by 90 mev than the corresponding i4/mmm symmetry structure . however , as described later , the primary conclusion of our results is found to remain unaffected by this possible change of symmetry .",
    "table i. shows the theoretically optimized crystal structures obtained using plane wave basis@xcite , of sfmo , and that of lfmo assuming i4/mmm symmetry as well as p2@xmath37/n symmetry .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the exact diagonalization of the low - energy hamiltonian , as given in eqn .",
    "2 has been carried out for finite size lattice of dimensions 4 @xmath13 4 @xmath13 4 , 6 @xmath13 6 @xmath13 6 and 8 @xmath13 8 @xmath13 8 .",
    "the hopping parameters and the onsite energies were taken out of dft calculations , as listed in table iv .",
    "for convenience of calculation , we have neglected the small tetragonality reflected in the parameters listed in table iv . the dominant hopping interaction which is between nearest - neighbor fe and mo",
    "is found to be of the order of 0.3 ev , while the spin exchange splitting at fe site as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-6 ] , is of order of the 3 ev , an order of magnitude larger than the dominant hopping interaction .",
    "this justifies the assumption of @xmath30 limit as adopted in eqn .",
    "2 . this makes the rank of the hamiltonian to be diagonalized as 9/2 @xmath13 n@xmath40 for a n @xmath13 n @xmath13 n lattice@xcite .",
    "the energy differences between the fm and g - type afm phase ( solid line ) and the fm and a - type afm phase ( dashed line ) plotted as a function of the number of conduction electrons , as obtained by exact diagonalization of the low - energy hamiltonian for a 8 @xmath13 8 @xmath13 8 lattice .",
    "only the region outside the hashed regions , from carrier concentration 1 to 3 is of relevance for sr@xmath8la@xmath9femoo@xmath4.,width=264 ]    the energy difference between ferromagnetic configuration and g - type and a - type antiferromagnetic configuration of fe spins as a function of carrier concentration is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig-7 ] .",
    "the negative values of the energy differences indicate the stability of the ferromagnetic phase while the positive values indicate the stability of the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the cross - over happens for a value of conduction electrons equal to about @xmath41 2.6 , corresponding to @xmath39 1.6 , which agrees well with the results of 8 formula unit supercell calculations , given the assumption of infinite hund s coupling at fe site and the finite size effect .",
    "this agreement is nontrivial , since the effective hamiltoanian has only 12 spin - orbitals , and hence 12 bands , as compared to the 500 band calculation with 8-formula unit supercells .",
    "this in turn , validates the construction of low - energy model hamiltonian as given in eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , in terms of correct identification of the essential contributing terms .",
    "this gives us confidence in the constructed low energy model hamiltonian , which can henceforth be used to calculate many other properties like conductivity , susceptibility , magnetoresistance , including at finite temperature , which are not easily accessible within dft .",

    "as in fig  [ fig-7 ] , the region outside the hashed regions , from carrier concentration 1 to 3 is of relevance for sr@xmath8la@xmath9femoo@xmath4.,width=264 ]    as an example , we have used the solutions of the low - energy hamiltonian to calculate the magnetic transition temperatures by calculating the difference between the paramagnetic phase and the relevant magnetic phases .",
    "the paramagnetic phase was simulated as disordered local moment calculations , where the calculations were carried out for several ( @xmath41 50 ) disordered configurations of fe spin and were averaged to get the energy corresponding to paramagnetic phase .",
    "we note that , such a calculation would have been rendered extremely difficult within ab - initio owing to the computational time involved using large supercells , and also averaging them over myriad configurations .",
    "[ fig-8 ] shows the transition temperatures plotted as a function of carrier concentration .",
    "the ferromagnetic transition temperature at carrier concentration of 1 , which corresponds to sfmo compound , is found to be 360 k in comparison to measured value of 410 k @xcite . the ferromagnetic t@xmath42 is found to decrease upon increasing la concentration , and finally becomes zero . upon suppression of ferromagnetic t@xmath42 , the transition temperature of the antiferromagnetic phase , t@xmath43 starts growing , hitting a maximum value for the end member , lfmo .",
    "using the combination of first - principles dft calculations and exact diagonalization calculations of low - energy hamiltonians , we showed that the la doped sr@xmath2femoo@xmath4 compounds become progressively more unstable towards ferromagnetism as the la concentration is increased .",
    "for the la rich members of sr@xmath8la@xmath38femoo@xmath1 series with @xmath44 , the ground state becomes antiferromagnetic .",
    "this antiferromagnetic phase is found to be governed by the kinetic energy driven mechanism as operative in sfmo and achieved by change in carrier concentration .",
    "in contrast to the super - exchange driven antiferromagnetic phase found in case of double perovskite like sr@xmath2fewo@xmath1 @xcite , this antiferromagnetic phase presumably is metallic .",
    "our dft calculations found antiferromagnetic solutions with finite density of states at fermi energy .",
    "the preliminary calculations of the matrix elements of the current operator also turned out to be non - zero . this will be taken up with more rigor in near future .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculations done by chattopadhyay and millis  @xcite , using a one - band model hamiltonian .",
    "this was , however , a single site calculation , and hence there was no possibility of capturing an antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "their @xmath45 vs @xmath46 plot for the ferromagnetic phase , however , was very similar to ours , as shown in fig .",
    "9 , in the sense that the @xmath45 first increased , and then decreased with increasing filling , finally , becoming @xmath47 at a filling close to @xmath48 .",
    "the additional and the most important finding of our study is that our calculations also demonstrate the cause of the vanishing @xmath45 : namely the emergence of the afm phase .",
    "there are however , several important issues which needs to be considered",
    ". formation of pure la@xmath2femoo@xmath4 to best of our knowledge is not been reported in literature , which presumably is due to relative scarcity of mo@xmath49 ions in octahedral environment .",
    "la rich sfmo samples , therefore seem more promising candidates for exploration of the antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "another important issue to bother about is the issue of antisite disorder , which has not been considered in our study .",
    "the necessary conditions of formation of double perovskites with ordered , rock salt arrangement of b and b@xmath3 transition metal ions are that the size difference between b and b@xmath3 ions should be sufficiently large as well the nominal charge difference . with the increase of la concentration ,",
    "the extra doping electrons populate the mo t@xmath24 down spin sub - band crossing the fermi energy . as a result ,",
    "the mo@xmath50 nominal valence in sfmo becomes mo@xmath51 in the doped compounds , @xmath18 being the number of doped electron with a maximum value of 2 .",
    "this decreases the charge difference between fe@xmath52 and mo .",
    "this is expected to be detrimental to the ordering , though the ionic radii difference between fe@xmath49 ( 0.645  ) and mo@xmath49 ( 0.69  ) is larger than that between fe@xmath49 and mo@xmath53 ( 0.65  ) .",
    "the study on sfmo in this context @xcite , find that even for a disordered sample , as given by x - ray study , the local ordering is maintained with a domain structure .",
    "annealing conditions can give rise to domain structures with varying sizes of the domain .",
    "this gives us the hope in the observation of the antiferromagnetic phase in the la rich sfmo samples .",
    "attempts are already being made to prepare these overdoped samples locally , and preliminary results suggest existence of magnetic phases different from ferromagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "on theoretical front , effect of disorder has been studied by alonso et .",
    "al . @xcite . within a variational mean field framework",
    ", they found that the filling / doping at which the tc goes to zero increases upon increasing antisite disorder .",
    "this means that antisite disorder stabilizes the ferromagnetic phase . in other words ,",
    "the antisite disorder is expected to reduce the stability of the antiferromagnetic phase , which is also seen in our preliminary calculations .",
    "we wish to carry out systematic study of the antisite disorder in future , keeping in mind possible formation of domain structures .",
    "finally , within the kinetic energy driven mechanism , the ferromagnetism gets destabilized and the antiferromagnetism wins when the carrier concentration reaches such a value that the b@xmath3 d states gets filled up in one spin channel and tries to populate the other spin channel .",
    "such situation is encountered also in case of another double perovskite , sr@xmath2croso@xmath1 .",
    "os being in nominal 5 + state , is in d@xmath40 configuration with completely full os t@xmath24 states in the down spin channel and lies within exchange split energy levels of cr - t@xmath24@xcite , a case very similar to la@xmath2femoo@xmath1 .",
    "sr@xmath2croso@xmath1 , in contrast to above expectation , however stabilizes in ferromagnetic configuration of cr spins . in this context",
    ", we found that the delicate balance between fm and afm , is governed by the extent of hybridization between the localized b site and delocalized b@xmath3 site .",
    "for sr@xmath2croso@xmath1 , due to the movement of the os t@xmath24 within the exchange split energy window of cr - t@xmath24 in comparison to that of mo t@xmath24 within the exchange split energy window of fe - d , the hybridization effect is weakened and also the finite spin - orbit ( so ) coupling at os site mixes the up and down spin channels , causing possibly the energy gain due to antiferromagnetism to be reduced@xcite .",
    "we believe our study will stimulate further experimental activities to explore the possibilities of double perovskites exhibiting kinetic energy driven antiferromagnetism .",
