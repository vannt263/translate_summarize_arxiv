    "we contrast two types of confinement for quantum systems , namely confinement in a finite impenetrable box , and soft confinement by means of a u - shaped potential .",
    "the simplest example is provided by pair of rather different problems in dimension @xmath9 namely the particle in a box @xmath10 $ ] and the harmonic oscillator in @xmath11 we use the orthonormal basis @xmath12 of the box problem to approximate states of the oscillator .",
    "we shall refer to this basis as a sine basis since the @xmath13 are scaled shifted versions of the eigenfunctions @xmath1 for the unit box @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "although the box functions are complete for the hilbert space @xmath15)$ ] , they can not represent the oscillator s hermite functions @xmath16 exactly .",
    "however , every @xmath17 is also a member of the hilbert space @xmath18 this observation allows us to use the sine functions as variational trial functions for the oscillator .",
    "the question remains as to what box size @xmath19 to use .",
    "this is answered by treating @xmath19 as a variational parameter and minimizing the upper energy estimates with respect to @xmath20 for example , we show in section  2 that by using a sine basis of dimension @xmath21 and optimizing over @xmath19 , we can estimate the first @xmath22 eigenvalues @xmath23 of the oscillator @xmath24 for @xmath25 with error less than @xmath26 .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that for problems which are softly confined , or confined to a box whose size is greater than or equal to @xmath19 , the sine functions indeed provide an effective variational basis . in section  2",
    "we study the harmonic oscillator and the quartic anharmonic oscillator in @xmath27 dimension . in section  3 ,",
    "we look at spherically symmetric attractive potentials in @xmath28 such as the oscillator @xmath29 the atom @xmath30 and very singular problems @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 here we employ a sine basis defined on the radial interval @xmath34,$ ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are _ both _ variational parameters . in section  4 we study problems that are themselves confined to a finite box @xcite , such as confined oscillators @xcite and confined atoms @xcite . in section  5 we apply the variational analysis two specific many - boson systems bound by attractive central pair potentials in one spatial dimension .",
    "in order to work in @xmath35 , we first consider the solutions to a particle - in - a - box problem confined to the interval @xmath36 $ ] . by applying the transformation @xmath37",
    ", we shift the box from the interval @xmath36 $ ] to a new interval @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "this gives us new normalized wave functions @xmath39 a special case of this shift is given when the endpoints of the box take the values @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "then we have the explicit wave functions @xmath43    we note that the variational basis @xmath44 is a complete orthonormal set for the space @xmath45)\\subset l^2(r)$ ] , and a general element @xmath46)$ ] can be written as the generalized fourier series @xmath47 where @xmath48 , with @xmath49 .",
    "this justifies the use of this basis for a variational analysis in which the box endpoints @xmath50 are to be used as variational parameters .",
    "we shall also use a finite basis @xmath51 and include one normalization constraint @xmath52 .",
    "this constrained minimization of the expectation value @xmath53 with respect to the coefficients @xmath54 is equivalent to solving the matrix eigenvalue problem @xmath55 , where @xmath56.\\ ] ] by the rayleigh - ritz principle @xcite for estimating the discrete spectrum of a self - adjoint schrdinger operator that is bounded below , such as @xmath57 , the eigenvalues @xmath58 of @xmath59 are known to be one - by - one upper bounds @xmath60 to the eigenvalues of @xmath57 .",
    "these bounds can subsequently be further minimized with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , or with respect to @xmath19 in case @xmath61 .    furthermore , to simplify the variational analysis we use the linearity of the operator @xmath57 , in order to split the matrix @xmath59 in two parts as follows @xmath62 where @xmath63 $ ] represents the kinetic energy component , and",
    "@xmath64 $ ] represents the potential energy component .",
    "the kinetic component will be the same for any potential , in fact , for the basis we have chosen , the matrix will be diagonal , where the non - zero elements depend strictly on the variational parameters and have analytical exact solution , for example , if we use a box with endpoints @xmath65 , the diagonal elements of @xmath66 are given by @xmath67 , for @xmath68 .",
    "this reduces the total number of calculations required to estimate the eigenvalues of @xmath59 .",
    "it is natural to use the well - known oscillator problem as a test for our variational analysis , since the oscillator is not confined explicitly and moreover its eigenfunctions span @xmath18 we take the scaled one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with schrdinger operator @xmath24 .",
    "the solutions to this problem are @xmath69 for @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the corresponding state , @xmath72 the energy of the system , @xmath73 the wave function , @xmath74 the hermite polynomial of order @xmath71 , and @xmath75 is a normalization constant .",
    "for this example , we use the basis in eq.([eq.2 ] ) , with @xmath40 , @xmath76 to construct the matrix @xmath59 . here",
    ", @xmath42 is regarded as a variational parameter .",
    "we then perform a variational analysis using a matrix of dimension @xmath77 , minimizing the eigenvalues @xmath78 over @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "we obtain the results shown in table  1 .    .",
    ".approximation of the energy levels of the harmonic oscillator @xmath80 in @xmath35 .",
    "here , @xmath71 represents the energy state , @xmath81 the exact solution for the energy , @xmath82 is the upper bound for @xmath81 obtained by the variational analysis , with the eigenvalues @xmath78 of @xmath59 minimized over the box size , and @xmath19 is the optimal value obtained .",

    "( [ el ] ) and ( [ eu ] ) are given by @xmath107 the lower bound of course agrees with the exact solution for @xmath108 for other numbers of particles , the estimates , just as for the corresponding coulomb one - particle problem , are weaker than those for the tightly bound harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is also curious that neither bound manages to reproduce the correct @xmath7 dependence exhibited by the exact formula of mcguire and mattis .",
    "if we compare the harmonic oscillator @xmath109 with the hydrogenic atom @xmath110 in three dimensions we see two very different systems from the point of view of stability and the spatial distribution of the respective wave functions . the oscillator is tightly bound and hardly exists outside a ball of radius @xmath111 , whereas the atom is loosely bound and must be considered out to a radius of @xmath112 or more .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the more - confined problem , the oscillator , yields to a variational analysis in terms of the sine basis , but the atom does not .",
    "the particle in a box is the quintessential confined problem .",
    "it generates a basis that at first sight might appear inappropriate for more general problems .",
    "we have shown that it is in fact very effective for problems that are either confined by the nature of the potentials involved or are in any case confined by the given boundary conditions .",
    "for a systems of @xmath7 identical bosons interacting by attractive pair potentials , the boson permutation symmetry induces behaviour close to that of a scaled two - body problem in which the kinetic - energy term is multiplied by @xmath113 and the potential - energy term is multiplied by @xmath114 we show that the ground state of this many - body problem can be effectively modelled by a product of particle - in - a - box wave functions optimized over the box size @xmath20",
