    "the decays of the neutral @xmath10 mesons to the charmonium state plus light meson pair have attracted lots of attentions recently .",
    "these decay processes could be used to study the spectroscopy in various meson pair systems , and they also have significant roles in understanding of the substructure of different resonant states . up to now ,",
    "several experimental collaborations , like lhcb and babar , have measured the decays @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13@xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the studies of @xmath10 mesons decay into three hadronic final states have been performed using different approaches  @xcite in recent years .",
    "the perturbative qcd approach ( pqcd ) @xcite has some unique features that are particularly suitable for dealing with the three - body @xmath10 meson decays .",
    "first , by introducing two - meson distribution amplitudes  @xcite , the analysis of three - body hadronic @xmath10 meson decays is simplified into the one for two - body decays . as pointed out in  @xcite , it is not practical to make a direct calculation for the three - body processes due to the enormous number of diagrams which contain two gluon exchange at lowest order . besides , its contribution is not important because the region with the two gluons being hard simultaneously is power suppressed .",
    "the dominant contributions come from the kinematic region where the two light mesons move almost parallelly for producing a resonance with an invariant mass below @xmath17 ( @xmath18 being the heavy - meson and heavy - quark mass difference ) , which can be catched by this new nonperturbative inputs .",
    "second , the three - body decays of @xmath10 meson receive both resonant and nonresonant contributions , it is difficult to separate the two parts clearly  @xcite . after absorbing the nonperturbative dynamics associated with the meson pair into the complex time - like form factors in the two - meson distribution amplitudes , both resonant and nonresonant contributions  @xcite",
    "are included in the pqcd approach .",
    "third , in the above dominant contribution region , the end - point singularities are smeared by the two - meson invariant mass , which suggest that the pqcd approach has a good predictive power without any arbitrary cutoffs .",
    "finally , different from the two - body cases , some possible final state interactions ( fsis ) may be significant in the three - body decays  @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , there are two distinct fsis mechanisms .",
    "one is the interactions between the meson pair in the resonant region associated with various intermediate states .",
    "the other is the rescattering between the third particle and the pair of mesons . in our opinion ,",
    "the former can be factorized into two - meson distribution amplitudes while the latter is ignored in the quasi - two - body approximation . over past few years",
    ", the braching ratios and direct @xmath19 asymmetries of the three - body decays such as @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite have been studied systematically in the pqcd approach . in a recent work",
    ", the p - wave resonance contributions have been calculated in the @xmath27 decays @xcite .",
    "the three - body hadronic @xmath10 meson decays with the radially excited charmonium mesons in the final state have not received much attentions in the literature .",
    "as the lhc gathering more and more data , the processes of the @xmath10 mesons decays including excited charmonium states must have much possibilities to be found .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration have measured the three - body decay channels of @xmath28 with @xmath29 collision data collected at @xmath30 tev recently  @xcite . in the quark model",
    ", @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) is the first ( second ) radially excited vector charmonium with the radial quantum number @xmath33 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath34 .",
    "both @xmath31 and @xmath32 were observed by the processes of the @xmath35 annihilation into hadronic @xcite .",
    "the properties for the two high excited charmonium were updated in pdg 2016 @xcite ; they are listed in table [ tab : pro ] .    [ tab : pro ]    .the properties of @xmath31 and @xmath32 mesons . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     different from the fixed kinematics of the two - body decays , the decay amplitudes of the quasi - two - body decays are dependent on the @xmath36 invariant mass . therefore , it is more convenient to compare these contributions to the branching ratios , whose results are displayed separately in table [ tab : br ] , where the labels @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 correspond to the contribution of the factorizable , nonfactorizable cases , and the interferences between them , respectively , while the label ",
    "total \" denotes the total contribution .",
    "it can be found that the dominant contributions to the branching ratios coming from the factorizable topology due to the vertex corrections , which are enhanced by the wilson coefficient @xmath40 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : vertex ] ) ) .",
    "the interference contributions are of the same order as the factorizable ones with an opposite sign , which reflects the importance of nonfactorizable effects in the color - suppressed processes .",
    "this is similar to the case of the two - body @xmath10 meson decays into charmonia @xcite .",
    "in this work , the quasi - two - body decays @xmath41 have been analyzed in the pqcd approach , assuming dominance of the s - wave resonance states @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the invariant @xmath36 mass distributions .",
    "both the factorizable ( including the vertex corrections ) and nonfactorizable contributions are taken into account .",
    "we discussed theoretical uncertainties arising from the nonperturbative shape parameters , the decay constant , the gegenbauer coefficient , and the scale dependence .",
    "it is found that the main uncertainties of the concerned processes come from the shape parameters and the decay constant of the @xmath42 meson .",
    "the predicted branching ratio and the invariant mass distributions for @xmath43 decay are in agreement with the results from lhcb collaboration .",
    "the decay mode @xmath44 has not been measured yet , while the large value of the prediction @xmath45 for it in this work waits the the future measurements .",
