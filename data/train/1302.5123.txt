    "semiconductor quantum dots ( qd ) have been widely investigated in the last decade because of their potential applications for electronic@xcite , photonic@xcite , spintronic@xcite , and quantum computing devices@xcite .",
    "different fabrication procedures are adopted to grow these structures , and quantum dots of various shapes and dimensions have been realized .",
    "a peculiar example is a quantum ring ( qr)@xcite , which has a doubly connected topology@xcite .",
    "hence , the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect@xcite , which arises from a change of phase of the particle wave function with magnetic field , takes place in the scattering - free limit . in circular ring - like structures the ab effect is manifested by the crossings of energy levels of different angular momenta in the ground state , which are referred to as _ angular momentum transitions _ , and which lead to oscillations of the electron ground energy level with magnetic field@xcite .",
    "in addition to the ab effect for single particle states , the ground energy level of the neutral exciton may exhibit oscillations when the external magnetic field through the qr varies .",
    "this _ excitonic ab effect _ was predicted for concentric one - dimensional ( 1d ) rings@xcite , where the electron and hole are found to accumulate different phases in each revolution in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "also , this simple model predicted that the bright exciton state can be turned into a dark one .",
    "these bright - to - dark exciton transitions produce peculiar oscillations of the emission intensity with magnetic field , which are referred to as the _ optical excitonic _ _ ab _ _ _ effect__@xcite . in a three - dimensional ( 3d ) geometry ,",
    "however , the overlap between the electron and hole wave functions are finite , thus the emission intensity does not exhibit periodic oscillations as in 1d quantum rings .",
    "rather , due to a small polarization of the 3d exciton , small oscillations of the exciton ground energy level , which are of the order of a fraction of mev , were experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "most works on the excitonic ab effect has been focused on in(ga)as / gaas quantum rings , which are self - assembled by means of the stranski - krastanov ( sk ) growth,@xcite and are strained because of lattice mismatch between in(ga)as and gaas .",
    "strain is involved in both the initial phase of the self - assembly of lens - shaped quantum dots , and the subsequent dewetting procedure which leads to an outward diffusion of in adatoms from the central part of the inas islands . as a result ,",
    "the formed quantum rings have volcano - like shapes , and exhibit substantial compositional intermixing between the dot and the matrix @xcite .",
    "the redistribution process has been demonstrated to be strongly temperature dependent@xcite , and qr s of various composition and morphology have been fabricated@xcite . for example , self - assembled quantum rings exhibiting considerable in - plane anisotropy have been explored in refs .  . more recently , almost axially symmetric in(ga)as / gaas quantum rings were fabricated and analyzed@xcite , but no height versus radius dependence of these rings was determined .    when the qr opening is covered by the material of the ring ,",
    "the ab oscillations of the single - particle states are considerably modified @xcite . in view of the recent experimental discovery of the excitonic ab effect in type - i quantum rings@xcite",
    ", a few issues deserve special attention . _",
    "first _ , increasing the height of the qd rim with respect to the height of the inner layer [ see fig.1 ] enables larger space for both the electron and hole in the rim , and therefore the exciton states could exhibit a qr - like behavior@xcite .",
    "_ second _ , band mixing could have an important impact on the hole states , and in turn their dependence of the exciton ground state energy on the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "_ third _ , recent theoretical results have indicated that the spatial variation of strain in fully opened quantum rings is beneficial for the appearance and the magnitude of excitonic ab oscillations@xcite .",
    "strain could lead to an effective separation of the electron and hole , thereby increasing the exciton polarization .",
    "a similar separation of the electron and hole in type - ii quantum dots was previously found to promote excitonic ab oscillations@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore how the layer covering the quantum ring opening affects the excitonic aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "we assume that the analyzed ringlike quantum dot ( rlqd ) is axially symmetric , as depicted in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the electron , hole , and exciton states are computed for a few values of the rim height and fixed height of the inner layer , as illustrated in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the strain distribution is obtained within the approximation of isotropic elasticity in the continuum mechanical model@xcite .",
    "the electron envelope functions are computed within the single - band effective mass approach , whereas the hole envelope functions are extracted from both the axial and spherical approximations of the multiband luttinger - kohn model .",
    "the exciton states are calculated using an exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "we will investigate how the size of the rim affects the excitonic ab effect .",
    "furthermore , we explore effects of band mixing on the magnetic field dependence of the exciton energy levels .",
    "we especially analyze how strain affects the mixing of the heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) states and what are the consequences of this mixing on the exciton states .",

    "therefore , the changes of the hole localization due to the peculiar effective potential variation with the rim height shown in fig.3(a ) can not straightforwardly explain how the single - particle energy levels in the lk model are affected by the increase of the rlqd height .",

    "therefore , a change of the exciton orbital momentum @xmath213 is possible when @xmath211 varies . when band mixing is present , however , the orbital / angular momentum transitions in the conduction and the valence bands take place at similar magnetic field values .",

    "<S> neutral excitons in strained axially symmetric in(ga)as / gaas quantum dots with ringlike shape are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> similar to experimental self - assembled quantum rings , the analyzed quantum dots have volcano - like shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum mechanical model is employed to determine the strain distribution , and the single - band envelope function approach is adopted to compute the electron states . </S>",
    "<S> the hole states are determined by the axially symmetric multiband luttinger - kohn hamiltonian , and the exciton states are obtained from an exact diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the presence of the inner layer covering the ring opening enhances the excitonic aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the hole becomes mainly localized in the inner part of the quantum dot due to strain , whereas the electron resides mainly inside the ring - shaped rim . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , larger ab oscillations are found in the analyzed quantum dot than in a fully opened quantum ring of the same width . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the unstrained ring - like quantum dot shows that the amplitude of the excitonic aharonov - bohm oscillations are almost doubled in the presence of strain . </S>",
    "<S> the computed oscillations of the exciton energy levels are comparable in magnitude to the oscillations measured in recent experiments . </S>"
